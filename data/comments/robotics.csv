It's also worth noting that the demos are carefully prepared, where the DRC was a competition with some curveballs thrown at the teams (walking over random uneven rubble, intermittent loss of communication with the robot, etc).   I think if you're going to look at why we haven't come further than we have, a big reason is the lack of economic incentive to develop these types of bots. It's just more efficient to build purpose built robots rather than it is to make general purpose bipeds. The applications where all the money is at like warehouse management, manufacturing, etc.  are all done far better by machines that are purpose built and don't rely on inefficient walking for locomotion.   You have to think of it in terms of opportunity cost. Spending 1 million on developing a biped robot that can make your company 2 million dollars, vs spending 1 million on developing a stationary bot that works on a manufacturing line and can make your company 20 million dollars. You can look at it as the development of the biped making you a million dollars, but really in a business sense it's costing you the opportunity to make an additional 19 million.

robotics,3dx7n9,jankyshanky,5,Mon Jul 20 16:02:20 2015 UTC,"Human gait is pretty well understood, but it's very complex. Many robots try to simplify the problem by making a rigid pelvis and having the legs bend exclusively at the joint. In reality the pelvis is very active during walking, alternating between a rigid support structure and a flexible moving structure. Another difference is momentum, and you can see this if you try and walk around very slowly, it's easy to lose your balance. Human walking is fast enough that our momentum allows us to keep our balance and keep moving long enough to correct for mild variations that arise while walking. It's hard to describe but if you see a video or have experienced hitting an unexpected small hole while running, you know the feeling of feeling off balance but correcting on the next step or two."

robotics,3dx7n9,leafhog,18,Mon Jul 20 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"Im actually just studying this for an exam that im writing later today. For bipedal walking you try and control the balance and therefor the center of mass of the robot. If we only needed to worry about the static properties of the system this could be quite easily accomplished, but obviously you would want you robot to walk at a reasonable speed and thus dynamics come into play. Achieving dynamic stability can be very difficult. One approach is zero moment point control, the honda robot assimo makes use of this. As mentioned in the above comment, humans walk by moving their center of mass in front of their body and then catching themselves. This requires very complex control in combination with a very a good model of the dynamics of the system. A saw a team working on this at the darpa challenge. Unfortunately cant find the link at the moment  [edit:] Another problem is that the torso is often so much heavier than the legs (Think of the atlas robots), this means that the center of mass is very high up and above the pivotal point. They call this the inverted pendulum problem"
robotics,3dx7n9,TheNeutralObserver,3,Tue Jul 21 04:12:27 2015 UTC,"And even when we can figure out a control scheme, you still need to cram enough actuators in there to actually pull off the needed changes.  While robots with 4+ legs are often simplified compared to their animal counterparts (for example, no ankle), it's much harder to do that with bipedal movement and still retain the necessary control."
robotics,3dx7n9,xandar,3,Mon Jul 20 08:58:31 2015 UTC,"modeling the body internally only i think is only one half of the problem. knowing exactly the size/weight of each point on the body lets you know well how it should be able to stand. but sensors aren't perfect. there are things like wind, or variation on the ground from height, or even friction differences. unexpected external forces. sometimes actuators can drift (like your muscles getting tired after a long bicycle ride) or there is external noise influencing things (like getting dizzy) its all of those extra unknown things that make standing and walking really really hard, even for humans."

robotics,3dx7n9,joeflux,6,Mon Jul 20 16:46:44 2015 UTC,"90% of the robots you see in the press use the zero moment point algorithm.  Its slightly more advanced than the previous center of gravity algorithms.  Hybrid algorithms are the next most advanced thing, but they are still probably one step below real walking/running.    Center of gravity algorithms always keep the center of gravity over the feet.  They move as slowly as possible, and any large disturbance will knock the CoG from over the foot and cause a fall.  Only the very old biped robots used this, as its quite unstable, and has no built in way to detect falls.  The CoG algorithm is statically stable- you can pause it at any point, and it'll stay up.  It walks by being 100% sure it is never out of balance, using big, flat, hard feet and lots of hip motion.  The Zero Moment Point algorithm is much more stable.  It accounts for the inertia of the robot, and can tell when the robot is about to fall, and when the robot cant move a foot to catch itself in time.  It is dynamically stable- if you paused it in the middle of a step, it could fall.  It works by calculating the zero point moment, which is the spot at which all your inertia is cancelled out by the angle at which you catch yourself.  Imagine sticking your foot out to catch a fall, thats what the robot is doing.  Conceptually related to an inverted pendulum.  Big step forward, and under certain circumstances it can look somewhat humanlike, but it still requires big flat feet and is easily unbalanced.  Mainly because the simple algorithm just pretends the mass of the robot is concentrated in the torso.  Better algorithms use very complicated, detailed models of the robots inertia.  The MIT ATLAS team in particular did this very well, using an algorithm that estimates this very quickly and accurately.  ZMP is still very inefficient though.  It requires very large ankle torques, for one.  Thats because it is in a near constant state of ""fall"", you can get a feel for it by walking slowly with a 20 degree bend in your knees and keeping your feet as flat as possible.  Basically the ankles are responsible for pushing the robot up.  Hybrid walking algorithms are more efficient and look much more like walking.  They put springs into the step, occasionally literally.  It adds in two phases, one for pushing up and one for catching yourself.  This is a step up in difficulty, because it makes the robot underactuated.  ZMP and CoG algorithms are fully actuated, because the robots foot is flat on the ground and the ankle moves itself.  In real, heel-toe walking, you roll over the bottom of your foot, and have no direct control over it; you have an axis of movement with no actuator, making you underactuated.  You have to control that axis indirectly.  The algorithm is a lot like trying to walk with a pogo stick, or a spring loaded inverted pendulum.    It creates some great results.  Hybrid control schemes are about 15 years old but still pretty rarely implemented.  Marlo there has 4 motors and four springs, no ankles, and she walks beautifully, efficiently, and fast.  Of course, she also has no legs and no spine, which makes her a little wiggly looking, but twenty years ago if you had told people you could make a biped with four motors you would have been laughed at."
robotics,3dx7n9,hwillis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:20:52 2015 UTC,Do you know what the efficiency for the ZPM is? Requiring high ankle torques doesn't mean it's inefficient unless they're used every single step. Is that what it does? I'm just having a little trouble with that part.
robotics,3dx7n9,newplayer33554432,2,Mon Jul 20 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"Walking is very rarely characterized by efficiency, usually by cost of transport.  Humans and passive walking robots have a CoT of .1-.2, ZMP robots between 2 and 5.  Atlas is somewhere 6-8, IIRC, because it uses hydraulic actuators which are less efficient at low forces.  MARLO, a hybrid walker robot that I linked above, is <.5.  Note that our most efficient robots are just about on par with human walking in terms of efficiency, which is stunning.  We can't even make those robots turn or change pace; they are mostly powered by gravity.  Human walking is absurdly efficient.    ZMP uses those high ankle torques every step, which is asking a lot of those motors, so you also have to have larger motors on the feet, and having heavy feet is very undesirable, as it makes them much harder to swing.  5kg at the foot is as hard to swing as 25kg at the knee."

And the .1-.2 CoT doesn't have units, so those numbers are kinda meaningless. And then everyone seems to point to a source which points to yet another source, etc, but no-one seems to be able to explain how those numbers were made in the first place.  Whatever, I'll figure it out. Thanks for the replies"
robotics,3dx7n9,newplayer33554432,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:44:19 2015 UTC,"Because CoT never has units.  It's a ratio of power to mass*velocity at a certain gravity.  CoT of .1 for an 80kg man means he'll use around 80 watts to sustain a speed of 1 m/s, and 80 watt-hours to walk 3.6 kilometers.  At higher speeds this formula doesn't apply, as drag increases dramatically."
robotics,3dx7n9,hwillis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:52:13 2015 UTC,"Well, then it would still have units, even if they cancel out. It would be 0.1 W/(kg(m/s)(m/s2)). I was not sure if this was even in metric, in imperial the units would be different and numbers would have to change accordingly. It's like strain which is inch/inch or mm/mm or whatever units you want. Still should include the units, even if they cancel out.  Idk, maybe i'm just being difficult, I'm used to dimensionless numbers still using the units. I suppose if people already know the equations it shouldn't matter.  edit: I suppose Rayleigh's number is always stated without units. I probably should follow the math before making a fool of myself like this."

For example, we use very little haptic sensing in control input for bipedal robots, while having very rich foot pressure sensing ourselves. Also, we probably don't keep detailed internal dynamics models, that is not something brains are capable of.  There is progress in bipedalism because there is progress in computer power."

robotics,3dx7n9,keep_it_civil,4,Mon Jul 20 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"Well they came with more or less stable static and dynamic walking but it was still prone to falling if you gave it bad step instructions or if there is a hickup in sensor data. Most Atlas teams in the DRC had their own full body controller for walking and used that instead of the one provided by Boston Dynamics. Achieved if the wrong word I feel since yes it could walk but it's obvious from the amount of falling all the robots had that there problem isn't ""solved"" in real world scenarios. That being said, it was still very impressive that any robot could walk across that sand track in the beginning and both Virginia tech and the bdi controller managed it."

robotics,3dx7n9,kingofchaos3,2,Mon Jul 20 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"The main reason that bipedal robots do not perform as well as humans is that they do not learn to walk like we do. Programmers do their thinking for them. The problem is that there are too many variables and programmers cannot think of all the possible combinations.  What is needed is a motor learning mechanism based on goals, which means that we first need to define what goals are. Once that is done, the next step is to come up with a trial and error method that will find the right motor commands to achieve the goals. It is a little more complicated than that, of course, but I think goal-directed motor learning is the future of robotics."
robotics,3dx7n9,sixwings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:22 2015 UTC,"I believe this is coming from a CS background, and heavily weighted towards the problems on that side.

robotics,3dx7n9,kiwikku,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:24:31 2015 UTC,"We have limits on the material selection for one. Also we have to substitute motors for muscles. There's basically nothing linear about human tissue. For instance bone strength changes based on what direction it's hit in, how much water is in it, how many times it's been hit, along with 100 other factors. Motors and steel/aluminum are much easier to work with as they have pretty much completely linear or constant properties.  Ratio's also change depending on the person. Some people have skinny legs, some bike in the tour de france and each leg is as big as your chest (seriously, like 40"" thighs). You could get averages, but even if you can copy everything directly, the mechanics are still difficult because of many reasons.   People have sensors everywhere. Every hair on your body is a small force sensor. Your skin has nerves everywhere. There's the problem with the cost of thousands of sensors, and also with the electronics and how to hook them up, and then processing power to monitor all of them. If you get rid of most of the sensors then you lose a lot of control of the robot.  So the initial problems with copying a human lie with materials which are substituted and not quite as good for the purposes needed. Actuators which are not ideally suited, and the placement of them has to be different. Then add a lack of sensors to boot. These are just the first problems, there's tons more when you get to trying to nail down specifics.  It's much easier to make something similar that work well with what we can use right now."

The biggest problem with them is that they're incredibly inefficient, like 1-3% efficiency is really good for them. So your battery pack has to be ~30-100 times as heavy to do the same thing as a motor.  The best thing about them is that they're small and have the capability for huge power density, so if you have almost no space to work in they might be viable. That's really the only place they'd be useful. It seems better to hook up regular stainless steel cable to a motor than use those things."

I would still be wary of the inefficiencies of it though. Every time you heat it, when it cools all that energy that went into the heat and not into the work done is lost. If it's within an order of magnitude of the efficiency of a motor (between 20-100% efficient I'd guess) it should an option to consider.  That's the same problem with memory metal/muscle wire/any of the other 10 names it has. However that other stuff actually goes through a phase change and has a theoretical max efficiency of around 10% I believe. This is just looped and seems to utilize coeffiecient of thermal expansion. I'm going to be thinking about this for a while, thanks!"

robotics,3dx7n9,kiwikku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"Walking is merely controlled falling. Falling is easy, controlling the fall... not so much. You have to take into account the mass of the body, weight ratios (which can change as moving parts shift the weight around) as well as the entire spectrum of speed at which this body can and will be falling. IN addition to that, the method of locomation is a limiting factor, or at least has been in the past. Until recently, we've only really had... what are those servos called... linear motors? It's a joint that can turn in only two directions, compared to a human joint that rolls in a socket and has a much greater range of motion.   There's also the energy demands of robotic systems. Look at that asimo robot made by Honda, half of that thing's weight is JUST the battery on it's back. If it's power starts to run out (which it invariably does, usually within two to four hours of operation) the control systems won't have enough power and are prone to failing."

The eyes sense walls, but also can sense goals on a separate input.  So the eyes have 2 different inputs, but their positions are the same (ignoring the rear facing ones).  First I train it up to avoid walls, then add goals. So for the first part the input on goals is always 1.0, then in the second part it starts receiving signals much like the wall signals, with some correlation to the same directions through a reward signal that includes walls proximity in goals reward.  Seems like almost instantly it gets a good idea of ""sensing goal on that input is the same as sensing wall on this other input, left is left, right is right, I know how to do this"". Takes a good while longer to figure out walls won't lead to rewards, but that may be this type of reward structure (goals can be seen through walls) not helping convergence."

It mostly depends on a combination of how fast your robot needs to go, and (in basic terms) how much energy it takes to accelerate it to the speed. In practical terms choosing a motor depends on speed, and how much your robot weighs. Without finding knowing your use case it would be hard to find you a motor.   The Vex kit has decent Mecanum wheels with appropriate motors if your robot is small enough to use them (That is around 10-15 pounds) and a possibly slow speed is acceptable (about 1.5 feet/sec at max speed).

robotics,3dwwsk,interfior,2,Mon Jul 20 06:58:57 2015 UTC,"The easiest way if you have an computer running linux or something is to connect it to a normal wireless network. This would only work over relatively short distances. Also certain environments are not well suited to wireless signals such as underwater or anywhere that blocks wireless signals. If both computers are connected to the same network there is a lot of software to communicate between computers (SSH, webpages, sending UDP/TCP packets manually).   You could also try some radio transceivers. These are good if you only have an arduino or something similar. These require a little more hardware and software to setup, and often aren't as convenient to use as a normal wireless network. You likely have to write code to send the relevant information yourself. You might be able to get more range and better robustness if you get good hardware. The same problems with the environments blocking radio waves.    You can also just keep a really long cable and keep it connected to your robot. This can be a CAT5 cable or something similar. This is really good if the area is not good for wireless communication (like underwater). You have to be mindful of what the maximum length of cable before the signal decays. If on say a raspberry pi, you can connect just like the internet and have lots of software to communicate between computer. For a arduino you can communicate over serial or get hardware and software to setup a similar network solution.   Lastly if it is an option you can just record the information locally and recover the robot later. Obviously this is not a good idea if the electronics can get damaged.   These are the basic ways, and I didn't go into much detail. But most types of communication will take the basic form of one of these."

Edit thought 2: on such a small bot, would a rotating magnetic field from thread magnets cause any interference with your electronics/unshielded wires?"
robotics,3dpi23,provocateur133,2,Sat Jul 18 16:34:47 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the magnetic treads just mean you need stronger motors to overcome the tread sticking to the floor? I don't see this working unless you build electromagnetic track pieces.
robotics,3dpi23,Sgt_ZigZag,2,Sat Jul 18 05:54:47 2015 UTC,"If every tread link were magnetic, im not sure it would take much extra force to run because the front tread link would be counteracting the force of the rear tread link, no?"
robotics,3dpi23,alonjar,3,Sat Jul 18 06:36:26 2015 UTC,"You would have to align them in such a way that there is little mechanical slop and the moment one starts pivoting down to attract the opposite side starts rising up. fail to do this and they with tack down in a sort of box formation and cause sticking in both directions, not super easy but depends on the strength of magnets used also."
robotics,3dpi23,Roobotics,4,Sat Jul 18 09:23:39 2015 UTC,"It still wouldn't help, since the ""stuck"" magnet will require a much larger force to pull free, than the next magnet (still at some distance from the floor) will supply.  That being said, you only need to pull free one single magnet at the time if you align the treads carefully. If 20 magnets are gripping the floor at once, that single magnet should be negligible compared to the added traction they give."
robotics,3dpi23,geon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:38:17 2015 UTC,"If the overall momentum of the tread is large compared to the impulse of a magnet contacting or separating from the floor then it won't really matter.  You'll need a little more power to start moving but when your full speed will be the same even with a bunch of slop.  So I guess that puts a ceiling on how strong the magnets can be but there's a weight limitation anyways.  EDIT:  Oh, right ant weight.  Yeah, you probably won't have as big a momentum reserve so balencing carefully probably is the right strategy."

robotics,3dp8lk,GreyMX,3,Sat Jul 18 03:22:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry for being pedantic, but what you have there is a tree-structured manipulator, not a parallel manipulator. A parallel manipulator implies that there is a closed kinematic chain.  You could maybe make the case that there is a closed chain if you consider the ground to be part of the chain, but that's not something that's built into the kinematic structure of the robot, so it would not be a very strong case."
robotics,3dp8lk,GreyMX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, the ground is built into the kinematic structure of the walking base algorithm. There is a defined xy plane at a given z (calculated form an average z of the different legs in their home positions), then used as a closed link in the kinematics chain. In fact it is this ground think that stitches together each of the chains into a parallel mechanism. THe only odd part that makes it a special case is when a limit is reached, the leg that reached the limit is disconnected from the ground link (step up) reset to a new location on the ground link (step back down) then reintegrated into the parallel mechanism.   The main point is that the tips of each leg will be kinematically locked in relative position to each of the other tips of the other chains. It breaks this lock to reset a leg, but that is an out-of-kinematics operation for the whole robots perspective.   So i do make the argument with the ground plane as a link, but since it has an exception case it puts this is a strange spot where it can be treated as a parallel mechanism and also a tree manipulator.   I prefer the term ""creature"" anyway..."
robotics,3dp8lk,GreyMX,2,Sat Jul 18 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"From a strictly kinematics perspective, there is no difference between a tree-structured robot with its end effectors fully constrained versus a parallel manipulator, I will grant you this.  However, from a mechanical engineering perspective, the machine that you're simulating (or just visualizing, I'm not sure which) would not traditionally be considered a parallel manipulator, because the constraints that are producing the closed kinematic chain are not built into the machine; they're caused by interaction with the environment.  To be extra pedantic, what you have is a tree-structured robot with hybrid dynamics.  All that being said, I'm a little bit lost on why all the legs seem to be disembodied. I'm assuming the torso of the robot is just not being visualized."

I can live with that, and thanks for the detailed clarification, engineering is basically being professionally pedantic ;)   I'm a little bit lost on why all the legs seem to be disembodied.   This is an early Alpha tech demo. I t is a scripting platform where the scripts can be used to generate IK control law, walking algorithms, and even the CSG based CAD of the parts. This UI is visualizing and also simulating the running control law that can talk directly to our motion controller, or to a virtual device if i can not find a connected motion controller.   When its released into Beta it will let you open a sample robot, change where the legs are, how many it has, and their shapes and sizes from menus (that half works and is what is begin shown)   Then you hit print, and it generates the .stl's of each part to be sent to a 3d printer. When the parts are printer, you pop in the servos, plug them into the DyIO motion controller, and the walking deom from your screen starts walking on the desk in front of you."

We're close to releasing a high quality whole-body IK module that would probably be very useful for your application. We're always happy for our community to grow, so if you're interested in using DART under the hood, let me know and I can help you get started with it."
robotics,3dp8lk,GreyMX,2,Sat Jul 18 17:57:17 2015 UTC,"The UI is a display of the modular and dynamically reconfigurable FK/IK system i have been working in medical research labs for the pats 7 years, so i think i may be a bit tied to it. Its also 100% Java for all kinematics, so C++ is not very attractive (I already have 3 projects that i have to maintain JNI's/Installers for, never again!)   That said we only have a few IK modules and would love to incorporate the algorithms of better/different ones. The kinematics system is a 2 tier system of D-H parameter chains, with ""MobileBases"" that hold lists of attached chains. You can also nest MobileBases inside any D-H link for branching systems. Is DART D-H compliant? If so, i would love to up-convert the C++ IK modules into Java modules and include them.   As for How we solve the IK on the D-H chains, its a semi-analytical solution that works on 3,4 and 5 link chains (common legs and cheap robot arms).  The default IK is loaded as a script, and then the user at runtime can open the internal IK script, modify it, and it will live compile and load the new IK solver, all like at runtime so developers do not need to interrupt their flow to tweak IK models.   https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/BowlerStudio/blob/development/src/main/resources/com/neuronrobotics/bowlerstudio/scripting/DefaultDhSolver.groovy"

The car has no moral obligation, and no lawful obligation, and most likely no programatic obligation other than to do its best to do the least damage possible. Regardless, it has the ability to react to those situations instead of a human who wouldn't be aware at all.

Level 0: Confusion. At this level the individual has a degree of zero self-awareness. This person is unaware of any mirror reflection or the mirror itself. They perceive the mirror as an extension of their environment. Level 0 can also be displayed when an adult frightens themselves in a mirror mistaking their own reflection as another person just for a second.  Level 1: Differentiation. The individual realizes the mirror is able to reflect things. They see that what is in the mirror is different from what is surrounding them. At this level one can differentiate between their own movement in the mirror and the movement of the surrounding environment.  Level 2: Situation. At this point an individual can link the movements on the mirror to what is perceived within their own body. This is the first hint of self-exploration on a projected surface where what is visualized on the mirror is special to the self.  Level 3: Identification. The individual finds out that recognition takes effect. One can now see that what’s in the mirror is not another person but it is actually themselves. It is seen when a child refers to them self while looking in the mirror instead of referring to the mirror while referring to themselves. They have now identified self  Level 4: Permanence. Once an individual reaches this level they can identify the self beyond the present mirror imagery. They are able to identify the self in previous pictures looking different or younger. A ""permanent self"" is now experienced.  Level 5: Self-consciousness or ""meta"" self-awareness. At this level not only is the self seen from a first person view but its realized that it’s also seen from a third person’s view. They begin to understand they can be in the mind of others. For instance, how they are seen from a public standpoint.   At best I think, this robot is ""experiencing"" only ""Level 3"" self-awareness."

robotics,3dibq3,respeckKnuckles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:54:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's important here to carefully distinguish between automatically acting in response to some stimulus and producing mental representations given other mental representations. It's easy to argue that bacteria are performing automatic responses that we, the third party observers, can describe in some logic, because that's the way we think. But they bateria are not creating mental representations; they are not able to transfer their inferences to domains other than that of the original stimuli; they are not able to productively generate hypotheses about food in the physical absence of food. They are not performing logical reasoning."

The problem is that the throws are not very accurate, and it cannot maintain the juggling pattern very long."
robotics,3dfjo8,mcorah,2,Thu Jul 16 17:08:57 2015 UTC,"This is a bit off from what you are suggesting but I think Raffaello D'Andrea's blind juggling machines might provide some decent inspiration.  One aspect of designing the kind of system you describe is having good control, but you can only go so far without spending enormous amounts of money. You may be able to take a simpler approach that better takes advantage of the dynamics and potentially at a lower cost."
robotics,3dfjo8,NiftyManiac,2,Wed Jul 15 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"My first thought would be to use small, hard balls (ping-pong or marble-sized plastic spheres) and a solenoid or similar spring-loaded hammmer. Have a large cone-shaped collector which funnels the balls into a chute and positions them in front of the solenoid, and draw the solenoid back and fire as needed. That way you don't need to worry about throwing motion, and you can make it precise and repeatable.  You could attach a basic hobby servo or two to control the angle of the launcher along one or two axes. You could adjust power by controlling the distance you pull back the hammer (or the voltage applied to the solenoid)."
robotics,3dfjo8,NiftyManiac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:43:53 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome if it worked, but I am very skeptical that a solenoid would provide enough accuracy/consistency.  I've had negative experience with inaccuracies with electromagnets."

Then you can put a camera at the base of the robot looking upwards.   You'd have to code some basic image recognition in(which is tough), but it should be ""easy""(for object recognition) if the balls are a certain color, the robot is a certain color and the ceiling is a certain color.   Basically you just need the X/Y coordinate of the falling ball and put your catching hand there and initiate a solid catch.    If you're lucky, you might even be able to simply record some video of the robot tossing balls in the air, and then find some programmer to do the object recognition part for you."

robotics,3dfjo8,JDGallagher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:03:34 2015 UTC,"Something like this would be really really hard to do. Are you using pre-built arms or designing your own? Are you using paddles or hands? The speed, accuracy, and force you are needing would require some pretty well built arms. Controlling a motor or arm is easy on paper, but once you bring it to the real world things like unmodelled inertial, backlash, friction, etc. start piling up real fast.  The people who do robot manipulation research where I study use pre-build robot arms, like the ones that paint cars but a bit smaller. They are fast and accurate enough to do a lot of dynamics tasks, and makes it so that they don't have to ""reinvent the wheel"" to catch up to several decades of robotic arm research. However they probably cost a lot of money.  Can you simplify the problem into something 2D, like your incline idea. If you use a very shallow incline, like 10 degrees, the balls will move much slower and with less force. For an incline, you can also use small omnidirectional ""carts"" with a flat ""paddle"" attached to them to do the juggling. Kinda like how ""robot soccer"" is done in the wheel'd version of the recent robocup."

robotics,3dg31c,tyggerjai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:43:10 2015 UTC,"Well, ok then. The create-2 website suggests you can use a raspberry pi or Arduino as a controller. I would probably use the pi, partly for ease of coding (python, yay), and partly for ease of access (USB wifi, can program over SSH). The pi will also allow you to easily add a camera and screen. Any standard HDMI screen will work. The Pi has a camera module, but it might be easier to use a webcam, which gives you a microphone as well.  I have a guide somewhere for a Pi program that literally provides a web page on one end and outputs motor commands at the other, but there are plenty of guides out there.   Not sure what the create-2 provides in terms of power, you might need a 2s hobby battery with 5v regulator (""SBEC"") to power the Pi.   So basically - Pi, webcam, screen, (speakers), and whatever cable the create-2 needs from the Pi - I assume it's SPI, which is just a couple of wires (edit - looks like it comes with a custom USB cable, which again makes the Pi look like the easy choice). The software is more interesting, but there are instructables on getting a Pi to present a web interface with video, take direction input, and output motor commands. I'll look a couple up. Should indeed come in under $250 plus the create-2. Getting the camera and screen at desk level is the hard part :)"

You basically need to know twists, the Adjoint, and the Jacobian (all of which are also explained in the book).  You would never do it by hand either, you would set up all the equations and then Matlab it once to get the final equation above, and use the solve to get the equation to solve for q_doubledot given all the other parameters, which you'd double integrate discretely to get your motion."

robotics,3d6mze,hansolh,15,Mon Jul 13 22:56:37 2015 UTC,"I did the FIRST Robotics Competition in high school. I can say that it is in fact extremely programming-oriented, though it doesn't seem so on the face of it. Our programming team consisted of 10-12 people each year, and we had our hands very full trying to get everything to work. The code is never ""done"", there are always more features that can be added and autonomous programming to be improved. You might consider doing FIRST Tech Challenge rather than FIRST Robotics Competition, as the robots are less complicated to build meaning they can focus better on programming."
robotics,3d6mze,arthurlockman,4,Mon Jul 13 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"As an FTC/FRC mentor I feel obligated to point out that inch-per-inch, FTC robots are often much more complicated than FRC robots, because there's so much to fit in such a small space. Though they don't have to be as a rule, especially for teams who stick to Tetrix.   The reason FTC is a good starting point is that it's a fraction of the cost of FRC, and depending on when your competition is, you'll probably have a much more relaxed build season. Works better alongside extracurriculars than FRC. And the general barrier to entry is a bit lower because of the Tetrix kit."
robotics,3d6mze,THE_CENTURION,3,Tue Jul 14 00:22:05 2015 UTC,"You're right about the complexity. FTC still provides a much better starting point, especially if you don't have a huge amount of money to invest in the startup."
robotics,3d6mze,arthurlockman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"Another very important difference is the ease of fabrication. That's part of the cost factor, but it's worth stating on it's own. You -can- build a working FRC bot with the bolt together kit of parts, but they're generally rather limited in both function and competitive potential. Even doing that you still need some fabrication ability and a good deal more space to actually house and test the 'bot. FTC does have some custom fab, but it mostly bolt together hardware. That means you don't need shop facilities or have much of any training to put something together. Some hand tools should do the job.   Also on the note of the program fitting with other extracurriculars and school, /u/THE_CENTURION's point is extremely valid. In FRC build, we put in at least 3 hours after school every day, often 5 or 6 and frequently twice that on weekends. We do almost all fabrication from scratch in house though, so that's a large factor."
robotics,3d6mze,homer858,5,Tue Jul 14 05:26:42 2015 UTC,"I guess if you want a more software oriented approach, you could try the robot challenge for Arduinos.

Honestly, there's not much of a difference in programming level between them - they're all very involved with both engineering and programming.  The differences lie elsewhere. FIRST is an expensive, high-power competition requiring lots of manpower, and is a competition at heart. Botball is cheap, casual, student-oriented, and holds education at heart."
robotics,3d6mze,acetech09,2,Tue Jul 14 01:02:53 2015 UTC,Does Botball need good hardware design like FIRST? It seemed like there's less emphasis on hardware compare to FIRST so that students can program more?
robotics,3d6mze,FGpianist,2,Tue Jul 14 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"To add one more point, for FIRST or VEX, it looks like students don't have enough time for programming as they take too much time modifying and improving hardware of the robots"
robotics,3d6mze,FGpianist,3,Tue Jul 14 02:15:09 2015 UTC,"Nearly every successful FIRST team has divisions for programming and fabrication, both individually bigger than a normal Botball team.  Good hardware design does get you places in Botball, but a clever, sensor-reliant autonomous robot should win every time. One of my favorite things about Botball is that you can't ever be rampantly out-spent like you can in FIRST, when it comes to the hardware."

I never tried if the general purpose wireless networking we provide can handle a real-time video stream. We generally rely on local image processing and only transferring interesting features over the network. Not really applicable to your situation, but what we are exploring in our projects is Augmented Reality for supervision and visualization: Filming your robot with your smartphone/tablet, and overlaying the image with state and planning information about it.

robotics,3d4dlz,XenOutlook,2,Mon Jul 13 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"See, there you go. The only town and colleges I know off the top of my head that are really robotics heavy are Boston.   I'm not really keen on the idea of moving to Boston, but I enjoy this field of work more than I dislike Boston.  Just because I know someone will ask. I know Boston has a lot to offer, I just have two issues that are rather large sticking points. The first is driving. I don't like the idea of having to spend so much time in my car just going to and from work. Boston just isn't a very car friendly city compared to other large cities like say Phoenix. I know it's because of the age of the city, but that doesn’t make it any easier to accept.   The other is snow. I am in the Midwest, so I am no stranger to snow, but I would rather not be moving into an area with more of it than I deal with now."

I wanted to get into robotics, specifically UAV work, but wasn't sure where that would take me.  I interviewed at a startup in Colorado, a company in Berkeley, and a company in Cambridge.  I moved to Cambridge about 3 months ago with a lot of reservations about living in a city for the first time and their notoriously harsh winters.  However, my time here has been awesome.  My career is super rewarding and I get to work on systems that I love and the area is wonderful.  I used to go camping often back home which I cannot do here but other activities like sailing and kayaking have taken its place.  I commute on the subway or by bike and it is increadibly easy to get around.  I like life in the city and think it often gets a bad rap.  That said, in 2-5 years who knows what the industry will be like.  Robotics is growing really quickly and I wouldn't be surprised if you have opportunities all over the country given that timeframe.  You just will have to look for what you want, which will probably be more specific than 'robotics' and instead something like 'Sensing and percepction engineer'"

Do you mean you want all of the packages built so that the libraries, generated messages, etc. all use python 3 so you can write ROS nodes with python 3?  If so, you're going to need to rebuild all of ROS yourself and force CMake to resolve Python 3 as the default interpreter.

As far as I can tell there hasn't been much of a ""revolution"" in robot hardware, compared to what's happened with software. It seems to me that the ""maker movement"" is pretty distinct from the robotics developments that the article is talking about, and I haven't seen much open hardware on on that side.  ROS is about being able to reuse code across different (almost always proprietary hardware) platforms."

robotics,3d0bgt,wildeye,2,Mon Jul 13 02:50:58 2015 UTC,"My question was about the word ""open"", not the word ""hardware"". Obviously you need hardware, but the vast majority of robotics research and appliaction, even with open source frameworks like ROS, run on closed hardware."
robotics,3d0bgt,i-make-robots,2,Mon Jul 13 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"I have to repeat the work before I can improve on the work...Repeating someone's work. If I can't repeat your work...   This makes exactly zero sense, so I assume there is a language barrier here. The word ""repeat"" that you keep using is not communicating whatever it is that you actually mean in the current context.  You're obviously generally pretty fluent in English, but nonetheless communication is failing here.  If you need more explanation: look at the open source ""bash"" shell used fairly universally on Linux, or the ""vim"" or ""emacs"" editors. They are open source, and millions of use them. We don't have to ""repeat"" any work to use them, we just go ahead and use them.  The word ""repeat"" has nothing to do with the concept or practice of open source or free software or even proprietary software, for that matter."
robotics,3d0bgt,wildeye,0,Mon Jul 13 02:12:58 2015 UTC,"you have to be able to install and run bash before you can modify it for your own purposes.  The code for bash, on it's own, is nothing without the rest of linux.  See what I mean by 'repeat'?  maybe ""replicate a working model"" would suit you better?  I'm coming at this from a business perspective, if that makes a difference.  The code for any ROS robot is useless without the hardware on which to run it.  As much as the ""revolution"" is benefiting from people sharing code, it is also hampered by the lack of available hardware.  I've been trying to fix that problem, but I don't want to get into a sales pitch."

Sure, you need to learn how to use it and that can take a while, but why write your own particle filter from scratch when you could just run AMCL?  Sure, there might be some special case where you would need to write your own, but in general?  I really think that you're confused on the matter...  or could you provide some clarification as to what you think ROS is and why you think it's necessary to repeat the work of hundreds of developers that made the software for you to use and extend upon?"
robotics,3d13jo,bijansha,5,Sun Jul 12 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"From a hobbyist's perspective, the most expensive part right now are complex actuators. For small robots, even a simple 4 DOF arm can cost as much, if not more, than the rest of the robot. And I'm talking about a ""real"" usable arm with good position control and feedback, not just some junk servos duck-taped to Legos. The computer, sensors, batteries are all pretty cheap by comparison."
robotics,3d13jo,TooSunny,2,Sun Jul 12 20:16:43 2015 UTC,Heh. For me an arm IS the whole robot. Integrating multiple systems? Big ask.
robotics,3d13jo,i-make-robots,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:29:20 2015 UTC,"actuators are certainly very expensive. It of course depends on where you draw the line between good and bad position control. For example, we developed a 3D-printed robot arm for education. It surely doesn't have sub-mm precision, but it's still suitable for learning how kinematics works and for doing some interesting projects."
robotics,3d13jo,Silly-Freak,4,Mon Jul 13 21:43:40 2015 UTC,"Slide 17 of this presentation gives a breakdown of the typical costs associated with industrial robots. It doesn't cite a source, but the presentation is by Henrik Christensen who is a well-regarded world leading expert in industrial robotics.  The breakdown is this:   Basic robot system 20-30% of cost Auxiliary hardware 20-30% of cost Software 40-60% of the cost   So it may come as a surprise to some people that roughly half the cost of a robot is the software. I'm not an industrial robotics expert, but I would suggest that the reason for this is industrial robots need to have extremely reliable software, which means a tremendous amount of engineering effort goes into it."
robotics,3d13jo,GreyMX,2,Sun Jul 12 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"Things that cause movement. I don't just say motors as there are all kinds of different ways to cause movement and they all are way too expensive.   Look at the price to make a halfway decent 4 wheeled RC truck and you will see the problem.   For some robots it is the battery as a runner up. Again look at the battery required for running that same RC truck for 20 minutes.  I use the RC truck as the motors and servos used in them are becoming commodity items that are either used in many robotics projects or are similar to those.  The CPUs, cameras, transmitters, etc are all in a cost freefall.  Now there are cheaper motors to be found but the problem is that they will either gobble your battery, are hard to control, or just won't be good enough for a commercial application. You might be able to salvage the motor out of a printer for a reasonable price but to actually buy a motor that you could run day in and day out in a robot that actually does something you will pay a fortune."
robotics,3d13jo,EmperorOfCanada,2,Mon Jul 13 00:04:15 2015 UTC,"In my robots the ""long pole"" (most expensive single part) is the controller.  There any many machines I would make for which parts simply aren't available off the shelf. If I can make them that means everyone will have to buy from me.  To make them at a good price per piece means making them in the thousands.  Then there's the off the shelf parts. How many parts are in your robot? 50? 100?  Every one of them has been marked up by the oem, the retailer, and the shipper(s). It's very hard to make money on a product when (cost of the components) * 4 >= what people think it's worth.  You have to *4 because a retailer will take 2, your business eats 1, and the parts cost 1.  How about making just one of a robot?  If this is your first time, you need access to tools and software.  The good stuff ain't cheap.  The cost to get most of them is high enough that it's probably cheaper to make lots of robots to recover your investment.  3d printers are bottoming out, but mills have stayed and pnp machines haven't come down yet.  That means metal parts and circuit boards are mostly out of reach.  Software is cheap if you can code, but coding well takes a lifetime of practice.  If the cost of robots is going to come down any time soon, I believe the easiest approach is to find a way to make programming easier.   Case in point: my next robot won't have much of a brain, it'll be run by Twitch or some other online service. Use the human brains that are idle on the web for my AI.  Have I rambled off topic?

robotics,3d13jo,Zaskoda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"Loosely, pricing depends on how much off the shelf stuff can be used and what needs your robot has.   Off the shelf, most actuators for industry quality are $100-$500. Computers and controllers can range from $200 to several thousand. Software has software costs, around $100 per hour, but for all units. You're starting to see it add up. Compare this to the $25k price tag of a baxter and it'll start to make sense.  Custom prices are just about whatever the company wants to charge. If they do enough business it will drop down to that off the shelf line.  So if you are looking at a factory robot, maybe five actuators, high quality controllers and power supply, probably two months of programming, and an intended sale of 100 units. Say $1500/$3000/$320 as the split. If you sold 2 logistically complex units, you can see how that would shift to software. If you sold several thousand, it would be some balance of hardware and electronics as the final cost. Precision, strength and reliability means more electronics cost. More strength, complexity, and versitility means more hardware cost."

robotics,3cq2yz,bijansha,5,Thu Jul 9 21:32:46 2015 UTC,"I'm working on bringing the javascript DQN implementation into ROS, it's converging well and learns fast enough to be of practical use (half a day to turn down epsilon and decrease random  movements at 15Hz). Later will come to Caffe and/or Theano implementations.  I have a confined space hazardous environment to deal with, teleop precluded and robot needs to be cheap enough to leave behind if it can't find a way out again.  The goal is SLAM, but a human requires a different output from SLAM to what a robot requires. The deterministic loop-closure based approaches make maps for humans, but if that map goes wrong then it becomes a trap for a robot. Then you require mountains of edge-cases to escape situations and re-localise. Sure you can add a laser, more IMUs, more ICP, more Euclidean geometry, endless tests for false positives... or you can give the robot a brain, train it to go take some photos and come back...  That said, I wouldn't want to stand anywhere near a robot trained this way if it weighed anything over a few kg."

Currently it learns to avoid walls and go straight, no other rewards. Next I want to see how well it goes at finding RatSLAM sub_goals. Figure I can make it go back and forth (like a rat does, probably whenever it hasn't made a map topo link for awhile and ""feels"" a little lost) in attempt to have it learn how to make nice PoseCell networks. RatSLAM needs to see the same location from both directions for best results as it combines the visual experience with head direction cells.  If the brain can figure out how to do a decent job of working with RatSLAM then I avoid having to put lasers on for ICP to check false positives for RTABMap or similar. If the thing comes back out of the hole alive, it's a good day."
robotics,3cq2yz,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"Righto, so last night I gave it a long epsilon (how fast it turns down random movements). Once it reached 50% I turned on goal creation which means it gets input like the coloured balls in the website version, when it looks in the direction of a goal.   Given that the first 50% it's running into walls and creating false positives on the map because of all the walls looking the same at 2cm distance. So the map is a mess.... but then this-morning it's running around in circles in the middle of that map, appears to have learnt that it if it turns around, there will be a goal to see.  Also RatSLAM lagging to hell, so a lot of opto to do in general. Some extra debugging to see if it's really converging on seeing goals... A reward signal for when the goal gets ""eaten"" (not simple as the code is much faster simply popping the goal off array, and is a layer deeper away from ROS inside RatSLAM, but straight forward enough).  ""Appears"" to be a small success. Have to clean up the map along the way so it isn't trying to reach goals buried in a tangled mess of false positives, but instead working with something it can learn to navigate, hopefully avoiding future false positives.  edit: Much of the mess and lag was mistakenly running both RatSLAM visual odom and diff_drive_controller odom."

Going to need a bunch of tweaking to RatSLAM though, to set it up for more effective training, giving it a chance to reset every now-and-then to train on a cleaner map.  Also the javascript DQN implementation needs some further work, rules for keeping important experiences (The Atari paper replays past experiences in batches)... Experiences that taught it how to get off walls, how to approach goals... So when the average reward was low, when the walls were close, when a goal was seen.... Possibly also always keep the first X experiences. In my last experiment it learn how to get unstuck from walls, then forgot the key experiences and started failing, only to then relearn again. Some room for merging the RatSLAM experience list with the DQN one and pruning them using the combined properties."

robotics,3cq2yz,sixwings,3,Sun Jul 12 02:30:19 2015 UTC,"IMO, no.  According to Jeff Hawkins, goal-directed behavior is the holy grail of intelligence and robotics. I think Hawkins is right but goal-directed behavior requires the tight cooperation of a few specialized modules such as a perceptual learner/recognizer (sensory cortex), an attention mechanism, a motor learning/control module and a motivation module. Deep learning only helps with the perceptual learning/recognition part but it has major drawbacks, IMO.  Current deep neural nets, while powerful at classification tasks, are limited in that they use supervised learning, that is, they can only learn from labeled samples. As Quoc Le said, the greatest barrier to further progress in AI is the lack of an effective method to do unsupervised learning.  One of the things that DNNs will have trouble with is perspective. When looking at a chair, a robot needs to know which part of the chair is closer to the camera, which part is to the left, will it fit through the door, etc. Common sense stuff."

Precision is the ability to hit the same spot again and again. Accuracy is the ability to hit what you're aiming for.

On needles - the installation is brilliant on Ubuntu, but they made it sound like it would work on Mac as well. Not so much, but it took two weeks of trying before I gave up. The ROS tutorials were pretty good, but when I moved to the Gazebo tutorials.. they continuously cause ROS to throw errors that google can find no remedies for, have spelling mistakes in the commands or use commands that are not in sync with the github example code. Having very little intuitive sense for what's happening under the hood so far, it takes a long time to sort out what the tutorials meant to say, or what's causing my errors.   On design/behavior - the amount of things that are broken, or crash reliably (looking at you Gazebo!) makes me feel that the underlying code must not be test driven. My experience with large non-TDD'd code bases is that new errors will keep on occurring with every new release. I don't want software that I expect will break in new ways in every release inside a machine I put a lot of money into.   I'm also a bit confused and frustrated about the tools that ROS comes with - why did they build a custom package manager? Why are they shipping a custom build system?   What does roslaunch actually do? Clearly it isn't for launching programs, Linux does that fine on it's own, thank you, so what is its purpose? No one knows:  $ man roslaunch No manual entry for roslaunch See 'man 7 undocumented' for help when manual pages are not available.   What is rosed? It sounds like they are shipping their own version of ed! Why? I have a work flow I like already with vim, thank you.

robotics,3cmkth,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"made it sound like it would work on Mac as well. Not so much, but it took two weeks of trying before I gave up.   I've got a Debian Jessie install, just about nothing in the repo and many things with quirks or conflicts. The approach is probably overlay workspace with a source install of most packages.  Python catkin tools are more user friendly and got me through a few compile errors. http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html  Then for dealing with the workspace I stick with wstool.  Rosdep has a local repo /etc/ros/rosdep/local.yaml which can be used to give package names for anything compiled from source outside of catkin.  Then adding new packages, either to master workspace or it's child, goes something like this:    wstool set ros_tutorials -t src --git git://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git -v branch    wstool update ros_tutorials -t src    rosdep update    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro indigo -y --os=debian:jessie    catkin build ros_tutorials"
robotics,3cmkth,DontPanicJustDance,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"They did sort of make a lot of ros friendly tools and call them ros<xy>. For most of those things, they just make use of the ros_package_path to find your things. So roscd <package name> just cds into a package that's in your package path. Same thing with rosed for the most part. Want to call up your favorite command line editor for editing files relative to a package directory, use rosed. I have never used half of the ros binaries (even rosed), but I can see how they are convenient.  Roslaunch not only launches your code, but everything that needs to run along with it. All the nodes and launch files contained within are started by roslaunch. If a roscore isn't running, it starts that too. Also, it keeps track of every running process started in that ros launch command. So that, when you kill the roslaunch command, it also kills everything started by it. Man pages aren't common in the ros world, sadly, but --help usually works.   They started out with their own build system and then slowly moved to cmake which then morphed into catkin. The idea is that there are a lot of similar things you want to do in ros, like build and depend on msg files, so they wanted to make some short cuts onto a build system that would help build things on a huge disparity of build systems. This includes building and generating c++ files, Python filed and other languages as well. Something is needed to wrangle things.   Ros has only been working on macs for a short time, and gazebo too. It's certainly a less supported os relative to Ubuntu. I would suggest using Ubuntu as your main os of your robot unless you want a huge headache. That goes for any robotic framework.   Gazebo is often ahead of the officially ros supported version. You may lose a few features, but installing the ros supported version is the simplest install. If you're having trouble with the officially supported versions then turn to ros answers.   Gazebo is absolutely test driven. It was used to simulate the atlas robot for the virtual robotics challenge. The precursor to the DARPA robotics challenge. However incorrect api calls or improperly formatted sdf files can cause poor behavior with poorly worded error messages. This is partially a result that the most common use case is when a company provides these files for you. So, unfortunately you do have to summer through this.   There is the workspace directory, where you want to edit your files and the /opt/ros directory where things are installed. This is where the base files are installed. Generally, you don't want to modify files in that directory, but viewing them can be helpful. Edit stuff in your workspace however you want and then build it using the ros build tools.  It's def not easy programming for robotics. Esp, open source ones. Ros has long had a difficult learning curve, but I figured that's how it has been with robotics in general, so I didn't think anything of it. It's also open source software maintained by osrf (a non-profit) and volunteers. So tutorials won't always be up to snuff, which sucks, but you should call them on it. In either ros answers (by asking a q) or in the github issues pages. Despite not having such a nice rant like yarp, ros works toward the same goals. Reusable, robot agnostic software that makes your projects much easier to develop."

Given about 3 hours, you could easily complete the first 20 or so tutorials (particularly 2 through 17).

I think the comment about roslaunch was somewhat in the heat of the moment, somewhat diven by a feeling that I subjectively disagree with some major design decisions (like shipping a custom build system and building yet-another package manager).   My main gripe has been with the Gazebo tutorials, since they are both out of sync with the code they directly link to (eg. they constantly mention adding things to files, only for the user to find that a recent checkout of the rrbot repos already contains all those additions), contain direct errors or out-of-date commands and (perhaps due to that) they will say do z, y and z and then you'll see rviz do <blah>, or gazebo to <blah>, and for that to not be the case.   Eg: It's surprising to see technical documentation written in 2015 that is not backed by automated tests. The fact that the Gazebo tutorials are clearly not TDDd makes it feel very inappropriate to use for production systems, especially when the software trusting Gazebo for testing will be controlling machines strong enough to kill people."

ROS is an impressive work of software, and so I was inclined to trust its creators without much question during the learning process.   I have experienced some of what you've talked about, such as when I tried to use their SLAM demo tutorial and found outdated code regardless of whether or not I selected the applicable version of ROS that I had installed. I have much less experience with Gazebo, but given the patchwork nature of various companies contributions to ROS, I guess I'm not entirely surprised that their documentation is lacking (which doesn't make it any less irritating).

While I don't think it's perfect, it makes my job soooo much easier and more efficient than it could be without it.   For you, the question is more, do you want to spend your time writing and reading your control and perception code?  Or do you want to also need to write a wrapper for doing stereo matching on some other communication system, and a visualizer, etc. in addition to that?  If you're interested in the learning experience, then perhaps the second option is best.

Edit: I've been hit-up specifically about making robots look good, or making some user experience stuff more approachable. Since i like what i am doing, i haven't followed through.

robotics,3ch3r6,slightam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I mean, ideally it'd be great to somehow move over into the industry without having to put 6-8 years of studying into it ( can't exactly just quit my job with bills to pay to commit to school full time like that )"
robotics,3ch3r6,eubarch,4,Wed Jul 8 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"Long story short, it would be essentially impossible without at least a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering or mechatronics engineering. Even then, you would have to be an extremely talented individual and devote an immense amount of time on the subject without it being your actual profession.   The math involved with the mechanics of motion, control, AI/or algorithms needed to program everything can get very involved. With that said, there are alternatives, such as being a robot technician. I'll let you do some research on that... My suggestion would to go back to school if you're financially set. Better yet, pursue an advanced degree like a PhD in the specific type of robots that interest you, since the field is quite diverse. You may want to check out some MOOC's available, such as the one by Peter Corke, which supplements his textbook quite well. That may help you get a flavor and an introduction to robotics."
robotics,3ch3r6,slightam,3,Tue Jul 7 23:02:23 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Robotics is such a massive, cross-field subject that many of these people asking questions about career advice don't realize that to do robotics work with academic or industrial value, you really can't just do ""robotics""; you're going to be an expert in some more fundamental field, and work to apply that skill to robotics.  As a result, I think a lot of people that like robots don't know if they'd actually like working in the robotics industry, because it means they'd be a programmer, a statistician, a controls engineer, a mechanical engineer, or some other career path that they never originally considered.  Those that want to have their fingers in all aspects of robotics usually only have two options; either be rich enough to surround yourself with experts you can task, or restrict yourself to very simple projects.  This isn't a bad thing, though.  Robotics is responsible for many people discovering incredibly fascinating fields that don't have the PR that ""robotics"" has.  Maybe it turns out that you hate making circuits but you love programming and AI.  Maybe it turns out that you hate programming but you could spend all day designing a really elegant manipulator in Solidworks.  Maybe you don't care about any of that but you have a talent for putting together circuits that can run Android off of a coin cell battery for eight hours, and fit in a wristwatch.  Plenty of open doors."
robotics,3ch3r6,TooSunny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"Glad some more people can elaborate on how it is not as easy as it seems. Yeah, simple things can be done in an ad-hoc way, but controls of even simple 2-D manipulators or even a 1-D system can get really ugly...and fast. I'm working on my PhD in robot design and control and can assure you even simple things like kinematics, dynamics, and control are not easy. Anyone who says it is, likely hasn't done anything that is notable or has done simple bang-bang control or similar logic.   There are many opportunities focusing on the little facets that make up a robotic system such as the mechanical design, sensing, simulation, controls, human interface, etc. It literally takes years (and a lot of math) to get a grasp on all of these things."
robotics,3ch3r6,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"Hrm, I guess I'm just trying to wrap my mind on finishing an engineering degree while still working full time. I know it's doable, plenty of people have done it, it just feels daunting"
robotics,3ch3r6,slightam,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:57:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I would qualify that by saying it's not so much the lack of degree that would be the problem, but the lack of knowledge. Clearly, if someone proves they can build a non-trivial robot, then some companies may overlook the lack of a degree, since it's the tangible skills they want, not just a piece of paper.  There's a huge amount of computer science, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering knowledge necessary to make a robot. It's possible to learn all this yourself, but it can be very daunting. A formal college degree in engineering would help tremendously."
robotics,3ch3r6,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:44:23 2015 UTC,", it would be essentially impossible without at least a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering or mechatronics engineering   I'd say the opposite. In the early stages of any boom, it's those who have practical hands-on abilities or related experience, who are out there first and get things to market.  Impossible? That's not the planet I live on.   devote an immense amount of time   That's all there is to it. Sure you might need some learning skills and basic intelligence but there really isn't anything more to it than investing time. Can become an expert at anything in 10,000 hours.   The math involved with the mechanics of motion, control, AI/or algorithms needed to program everything can get very involved.    That's the part where someone showing you with real teaching could be of benefit, but really there are great resources to learn all the notation, it's just learning notation and lexicon once again. I don't consider any of it overly complex and I have near zero math education."
robotics,3ch3r6,madsciencetist,2,Wed Jul 8 00:04:21 2015 UTC,"Key word is 'essentially'...  Robotics has be around for around half of century so I'd say it is not in its early stages, just rather evolving with the coming of the IOTs.   The bottom line is it will be an easier route to get an engineering degree. I don't see anyone being a young new hire these days in an engineering department that doesn't have an engineering degree (I'm sure there are exceptions)."

robotics,3ch3r6,Stormhammer,2,Wed Jul 8 01:00:59 2015 UTC,"Getting hired straight into ""robotics"" is tough without a degree, yes. That degree says you know your mechatronics, estimation, controls, machine learning etc. There are so many aspects to robotics though that you can probably approach it from another angle. If you can teach yourself to program well, you may be able to find a job as a programmer at a company that happens to work on robots. You then demonstrate your usefulness, and when a robotics team needs someone to optimize the code, or hack a kernel together, or do some data plumbing, you find yourself on the project. You may then be able to transition into the aspects that interest you most.  It's a path that takes a lot of luck, but works around the barriers."

robotics,3ch3r6,jspri,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"The kind of software engineering required to build robots probably requires more proper engineering knowledge than you'll find in other IT-related software fields.  For starters, I imagine that having a solid foundation in control systems is critical to attaining a position dealing with robotics.  Control systems is very mathematically intensive, a course of study which would be difficult to acquire outside of university."
robotics,3ch3r6,YouFeedTheFish,3,Tue Jul 7 22:38:59 2015 UTC,"As a software engineer, I disagree. It takes a lot of work to build a software system that works and scales correctly. Robotics is just software with a different set of parameters, some of which extend into the real world via motors and sensors."
robotics,3ch3r6,Mr-Yellow,3,Tue Jul 7 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, some real academic elitism leaking in here. It's just code."
robotics,3ch3r6,YouFeedTheFish,5,Wed Jul 8 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"Some valid points... though.. Programming software is a lot different to programming hardware. When you work with robotics, its mainly programming hardware.   Control system knowledge is very important, and a fundamental to programming robots. However, great starting points are platforms like arduino.  For example, building robots is mainly about connecting controllers and interfacing systems and sensors. You need to understand the I/O of the board/schematic and program to that (Even if a systems engineer has built the board for you to program on). Or at a high level working on ABB robots (or equivalent industrial robotics) you use ABB robot studio and work with the robot in simulation building routines. On site, you teach the robot points in space, than optimise the velocities and corners between points, you are not programming software, and engineer has already built the tools here.  Very different to programming and or building software architecture to scale.  Background: software programmer building financial systems, also degree in robotics and worked for ABB etc.. I've also spent a lot of my career as a control systems engineer.   What can you do without a degree in Robotics (most, just a willing to learn):  1. Programming, but learn to program hardware.  2. Build a robot or automation system for fun. 3. Contribute to open source robotics systems 4. Chose a robotics area (I would say Industrial is out (ABB), but humanoid/hobby robotics definitely in). 5. Learn a robotics platform (ros.org)  Number 5, if you're proficient in a system that a robotics team uses no reason why wouldn't be valuable! Just need to demostrate why you're valuable to that team.  Also.. I've worked with Industrial Robotics engineers who don't have degree's but had an Electrical trade and work up from there."
robotics,3ch3r6,judethedude,2,Wed Jul 8 03:24:22 2015 UTC,"Right.  Even the Arduino requires some basic (basic) understanding of control systems.  As a matter of fact, I just came up from the basement where I was programming wheels for my robot.  Even that little bit of code benefits from knowledge of control systems.  In programming the wheels, I had to gradually spin up the motors and spin them down when changing direction.  If you don't know to do this, then you will fry the motors over time, or cause erratic behavior in the IC logic due to the current bouncing.    That's part of understanding control systems."
robotics,3ch3r6,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:42:04 2015 UTC,"4 Chose a robotics area (I would say Industrial is out (ABB), but humanoid/hobby robotics definitely in)   Lot more to industrial than arms in factories. Software guy and I'm seeing opportunities popping up for real-world industrial stuff with fairly low barriers to entry. Think from markets like people who would buy automated farm gates and take it from there, jobs where less people are in the way brings down the safety entry barrier somewhat too.   There are lots of niche tasks where you can just hack together a solution, with tools becoming accessible it's almost at the stage where all you need is a problem to solve and some time. Still a fair bit of high-level stuff involved, but capable people can get through it.  Know of a local Macadamia farmer who was the talk of the trade fares and saved everyone in the industry an employee with his newfangled invention for making the nuts go down the chute cleanly.... A piece of PVC pipe with a brick taped to the end. ;-)  Now if only I could get a contact sensor working in Gazebo..."
robotics,3ch3r6,poez,2,Wed Jul 8 06:28:47 2015 UTC,"It's not elitism at all.  Control systems is a real thing.  One has to understand feedback and control systems to operate real motors.    Programming feedback and control systems involves advanced calculus, Laplace transforms, Fourier transforms, differential equations, z-transforms.  If you don't know that stuff, you cannot write code to manage servos and motors.  It's that simple."

So you could also study machine learning, computer vision, planning, etc. All of these areas are as complicated as Controls Systems.   If you want to be a very competitive candidate, you should learn something about every area.   But you will never get a job programming how a robot moves without knowledge of controls systems. Controls Systems is a research field that people dedicate their life to. It's not trivial for robots. Getting a robot to turn is simple. Getting a robotic arm to have full range of motion is not. Getting a robot to contort his body to walk over an arbitrary obstacle is not."

Physically, the radiation imparts heat which can cause things to warp or melt, which leads to binding. Electrically, radiation makes some serious EM noise which can confuse sensors, the amps driving the servos, or flat-out stomp the RF control signal. On top of that, radiation can also cause random bits in memory to flip thus corrupting your program. Chemically, it can degrade plastics, rubbers, and materials in sensors which does back to physical/electrical interference (particularly if there are things like water involved)."
robotics,3ch8ly,Daelith,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:04:21 2015 UTC,Ok. Interesting. How are/could sensors be hardened to protect them since they cannot be shielded (which would prevent them from sensing anything)?
robotics,3ch8ly,Daelith,2,Wed Jul 8 11:24:19 2015 UTC,"Shield everything leading up to them to prevent signal interference, then use software to attempt noise reduction. Redundant sensors can be used as a comparison if it's really important to get a good signal (noise reduction + 2 of 3 agreement). Also, depending on the sensor you may be able to shield it in some cases, i.e. a temperature sensors. Sometimes, I'm sure they just have to leave it up to a human to make the decision and ask, ""do I really think X is happening, or is it a failing sensor?""

I think to get an idea of the kind of damage that could occur, people should take a quick look at the videos from the ""Robot Combat League"" where they had large humanoid(sort of) robot boxing.   The most common damage occurred when a robot swung a punch. The punching robot tended to damage their arms on the first blow.    Also if a key support in the body gets damaged then the whole machine tends to fall apart under its own weight. In some cases the robots own weight tore it in half."

robotics,3cbje9,TooSunny,2,Mon Jul 6 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"The reason most people don't use treads is there is a lot of slip when turning so the odometry is not very reliable. If you're doing dead reckoning, the treads will make it very difficult to navigate when you do turns. If you're doing slam entirely with optics then treads would be good, but I'd you plan on fusing any encoder data then your treads are going to greatly reduce accuracy (something a kalman filter handles well, but more accurate sensors lead to better accuracy).  I would go with two powered wheels aligned with the centre axis of the robot. You can then use anything dome or pyramid shaped instead of the casters and it should be able to drive around"

For the imu get a ""9-dof"" one that includes a compass. The compass will make a big difference because it is an absolute measurement for orientation, unlike the encoders and gyro which are relative (the accel is absolute as well but to get distance information you have to integrate twice and each time you lowering the reliability of the information)  Slam means making a map and localizing yourself within it, if you don't have a way of detecting walls/obstacles you cant build a map.  If you're not estimating your position on a known map you're not even localizing.  If you're not mapping and you're not localizing then you're just navigating.

If you can find a spot in your room (high up in the corner of a wall for example) that can see the room as a whole, you might be able to get away with using a single immobile webcam. There are a variety of free motion tracking software packages that you could use to try and have the system pin down when something is happening so you don't have to look through all the footage yourself. This is 'probably' the easiest way to go about it as pan/tilt cameras CAN be expensive, particularly if you are wanting one with night vision.  You can convert almost any webcam into a 'night vision' camera by removing the IR filter and rigging up some IR LEDs to shine into the room. There are various places online (google them) that can help explain how you go about doing this.  Really, the bigger problem for you is going to be that the rat likely moves around from item to item in your room in a way to make it harder to spot, which is exactly why it moves that way.

Measure the stall current of one of the servos- you may be surprised to find it drawing 3-6 amps.  Obviously being able to supply 18x that is out of the question but the supply should be able to crank out at the very least 10A, and ideally 12-15 or more.  Use multiple buck converters supplying different servos (not paralleled) if necessary."

I was figuring that each servo would require 350mA at most, for a total of 6.3A at max load if I was moving them all at the same time. Looking over the documentation again shows me that my buck converter can only supply 2A. To my understanding, the battery can supply the required amperage. The stall voltage on each servo is 6v, and I have no understanding of how to determine the stall current. Right now I'm using two servo controller boards. Do you think I can add a few more buck converters, and set up in a parallel circuit to supply the servo controller boards?"

Power it through an ammeter (most multimeters have a 10A range), command it to sweep back and forth or something, and wrestle with it...though of course with a supply rated for only 2A that will be the limit.  Putting switching power supplies in parallel is a great way to generate magic smoke (they'll likely end up fighting to maintain different voltages). So get a pair of bigger ones."

Prefab multicopter vendors are making the hobby too accessible to people who dont really know what the fuck they are about to do with it. They are a danger to our currently very fragile hobby. Flying a multicopter without properly looking into the rules is like joyriding a car through a shoppingmall. I would welcome a multicopter licensing system, this would cull the idiots that go to toys'r'us and end up tarnishing the reputation of us law abiding multicopter pilots with their ignorance.  People who buy a phantom have already shown they dont care about learning more. If they really were interested they would have looked it up on the internet, in which case they would have come to the conclusion that phantoms are noobcopters that aren't very well respected in the multicopter community."

Do you not see the news, and how people react to said news? 9 out of 10 negative multicopter headlines involves a DJI toy. Its often people with these toys doing stupid shit, because they have money and easy access to it, but rarely bother reading into it before flying. They skip the learning process and end up being irresponsible twats ruining it for the rest of us.  If 'outsider' people start hating multicopters, they will hate ALL multicopters, including the ones owned by people who actually know how to handle it, because outsiders dont know the difference. Responsible educated pilots will end up getting punished for the few ignorant fops that threw money at a toy. This is why DJI pisses me off. They give people a means to ruin my hobby."

robotics,3c6d6v,o--Cpt_Nemo--o,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:53:20 2015 UTC,"maybe she should ask the questions.  but hey fuck it, lets throw some ideas out; I've actually thought about this kind of a lot since seeing this and then realizing how much strippers/sex workers in general make (10 guys a day=25k a week=...1.25 million per year.  whaaaaaat.  Even at $50 an hour thats >100k annual full time).  First: getting a human skin texture is super hard and i don't know how.  Second, getting a realistic human feeling anatomy is super hard, and I dont know how.  You might want a few layers, and a few kinds of silicon and latex or whatever to replicate fat and muscle and skin, which moves over the top of everything under it.  Realistic bones might be nice too.  Realistic human movement and actual strength is pretty infeasable, in order to replicate human muscle you would probably want acme threaded rods and chinese ballscrews- these get expensive fast, and humans have lots of muscle.  They can also be loud.    As far as junk goes, self lubricating would be pretty neat.  If you mould it yourself, you can include tubes yourself, otherwise in order to add them you'd need a needle and thread, and then you use the thread to pull a tube through.  In order to pump in the lubricant, you'll want a peristaltic pump, these are super easy to make.  If you wanted to get fancy, you can include temperature sensors, heating lines and a PID controller.  You also want it to be removable so it can be cleaned and sanitized.    If you want humanlike bones, your best bet is probably casting plastics as well, or hell maybe just using one of those fake skeletons.  You're gonna wanna remake the ribs, they have a very particular brand of elasticity and strength in living people.    Breathing is a sexy thing people do.  Moving that large a volume of air would be really tricky without actually expanding the lungs like a real person though.  Lipsyncing is too hard, as is... really any kind of facial movement.  I could maybe do it if I had a research team, a supercomputer, a 3d printer and a few years.  Disney had a really cool algorithm for animatronics that measured the elasticity of peoples faces, then computed a silicon ""mask"" that had varying thicknesses, causing it to bend, move and stretch like a real face.  Another big problem is parting lines and seams.  Realdoll deals with it by having one, humongous fiberglass mould (I watched their factory tour, only mildly disturbing).  This isn't great but really its nearly impossible to get around.  Any complexity to your underbody, and you're gonna need a lot of seams.    Also female is definitely the way to go with a sex robot.  Unfortunately for ladies, but any kind of muscle under the skin, or real strength, comes with complexity and liability.  I think robotic employees in a strip club is ideal; its dark and loud.  Programming wise?  Probably some inverse kinematics would be ideal, to match thrusts.  or whatever.  Really what do you need it for?  What can a robot do to actually be more realistic?  Actually participating is way difficult, and like... scary.  So they wrap their arms/legs around you, move their head a little?  The kind of coordination to stroke your face, or suck a dick is so beyond what any hobbyist could realistically hope for.  A hug from a robot is like a hug from someone who hates you; they dont grab you, or hold you, or pull you.  A good hug is the best you could hope for, with a lot of work on compliant motions, and several hundred bucks in motors.  But it won't have the temperature, or the feel or the breath or movement of a person.  It'll feel like wearing a wetsuit.  A wetsuit with a wig.  We haven't even really figured out wigs yet, they feel all gross and coarse.  Really I don't see the appeal, plus you'd need to change your name to Pygmalion, which is gonna be awkward to explain at dinner."

Yeah it was annoying for that day, but there are other things that can occupy my time. Since it was so short, who cares? If it was a week or two I'd be looking for new forums.  4) The whole thing was about lack of communication between admins and mods/everyone else.

Robotics was always something I wanted to learn more about too... studying about it sucks though (just like any topic)... if you have an actual project, and you're working through it one piece at a time, it's so much more rewarding.  Start by getting an Arduino and going through the sample projects that come with it.  You'll learn the basics about the different components.  Then you can research those components if you want... but mostly, come up with a project that you want to do.  Would a robot make something in your life easier?  Doesn't matter how simple... just start somewhere.  I had an old riding lawn mower that I wanted to put a remote control on.  I bought the remote and receiver... then I needed to figure out how to read the signals from the receiver... so I bought an Arduino... went through the sample projects to learn how to code it and read the input... then just plugged my receiver in.  I figured out how to read the signal and how to code for the different channels.  I used it to light up some LEDs, just for fun.  Now, I'm working on powering the Arduino from the 12V battery on the lawnmower, and how to use the Arduino to power a relay (to turn on and off the components that will steer, and push or let off the brake) so I'm learning about transistors.

robotics,3bv8ja,amfoejaoiem,28,Fri Jul 3 01:11:15 2015 UTC,"I'm finishing up my PhD in robotics. Every robot I've ever worked on has required me to manually tune (and sometimes code) PID settings. Of you can do that, you've demonstrated many of the skills required. I'll break it down:  What you need:  Power source (battery)  Wheels and motors (with encoders, don't bother attaching them yourself)  An arduino (any will do, but you probably want a pro micro or something cheap with a USB port on it)  An IR sensor either for range finding or line following (not necessary at first but once you build a robot you may want it to do something other than ""dead reckoning"" navigation)  What you do:  Lots of googling to say the least, I'm not going to write up an instruction manual because most robotics research requires you to figure things out on your own anyways.  Go out and get some foam board from the dollar store or foam insulation from the hardware store. It's the easiest material to work with but also breaks the fastest, if you're more mechanically inclined you can build a better chassis but foam and hot glue can whip you up one very quickly.  First thing you need to figure out is how you're going to power your robot. For this you may need a step-down voltage regulator for the arduino, and maybe motor drivers as well I'd your motors are of any significant size. Wherever you get your motors from (say, sparkfun) there are likely motor drivers for sale to go with them. Figure out what voltage your using as your power source, and what voltage your microcontroller, motors, motor drivers, and encoders require. It would be convenient if it was all 5v. Now you're going to have to learn to solder, a great skill to have. If you're not ready for that, you can get a solderless breadboard which is great to have anyways because it's useful for making quick circuits for testing. Once you've soldered/placed all the wires grab a multimeter and check everything for continuity. Multimeters can be bought from hardware stores for $10, they have a setting where they beep when you touch the leads together. Use this to make sure all your wires have continuity between where they start and end(so between your motor ground and battery ground for eg), as well as making sure that there is no continuity between things that shouldn't touch (like + and ground).   Now you're ready to power things up. Look up example code from arduino for sending PWM (pulse width modulation) and reading encoders. Learning what PWM does is important for robotics as well. Try out different PWM duty cycles and use the arduino serial output to screen to display your calculated speed from the encoders. You may notice that the lower end of the PWM range doesn't move the motor, and once you get to a certain point they will spin. Using PID we will be able to spin them as slow as we want.   Once you've tried out a few PWM duty cycles and recorded their corresponding speed you can make a trend line in excel to relate PWM to speed.   Now it's time to make your PID controller. This will require a bit of research on what they do and how to tune them, I don't want to write a full explanation so you'll have to research them yourself. Once you've researched this formula will make more sense, but you will need something like this in a loop in your code:  (Error)=(desired speed) - (actual speed)  (Output speed) = (output speed) + P x (error) + I x (total error) + D x (previous error - error)  Total error = total error + error  Previous error = error  Output PWM = output speed x speed-to-pwm (that you got from your excel formula - you may need a different equation if your relationship between PWM and speed is not linear)  Now you have to tune your PID by changing the values of P,I, and D. There is plenty of information on this out there but you can ask me for help if you get to this point.   Of you've done all that then you're ready to program a line follower of made solver, which should be pretty easy of you've just written your own PID controller but your welcome to ask me more once you get to that point.   If you get stuck don't get discouraged, this is actually a pretty difficult project but it requires you to learn many crucial skills like soldering, wiring, power distribution and regulation, programming, and PID tuning (as well as some basic construction for the frame). If you can do this project I'd say your about as well off as most of the 4th year undergraduates I've taught.   Anyways, maybe this is a little much to take in but I still recommend getting an arduino and some motors with encoders to mess around with as a good way to start. If you're feeling confident then go ahead and try and write the PID controller. Feel free to post here or PM me with specific questions"

I'd suggest not going straight to hexapods or quadro(or more)copters but to start with something simpler, maybe two engined, tracks driven rover filled with range of sensors wouldn't be a bad idea to start with? Generally my idea here is to get understanding on how simpler things work before going to more advanced stuff. Based on what kind of robot you want, how you want to control it, or if you want to make it autonomic should help you with choosing hardware to use. I would definitely take a look at arduinos as well as more powerful computers like raspberry pi. Also, finding a good (and cheap!) hardware store may sound trivial, but is important as you're going to need a lot of different parts and tools before your project starts getting shape. Getting access to a 3d printer wouldn't be a bad idea neither."

The selection of parts, the number of online sources, it's just fantastic.  You are in constrained by a mortgage, kids, etc you'll do some amazing stuff.  Do you like solving riddles and puzzles? That's most of what building a robot is about. Sometimes the riddle is figuring out what question to ask. ;)  If there's any way I can help, please speak up. I'm always looking for things to blog about. Your suggestions for tutorials would mean a lot.  Do you have anyone to work with, or are you going it alone?"

robotics,3bv8ja,FurtiveSloth,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"I lot of people have given a lot of good advice here, but i teach robotics you your age (12-18) range with 0 expected experience, so I think this may be helpful/fun way to learn robots.   I use a tool called BowlerStudio and its a robotics development platform. It lets you get started learning what code is and how to use it make robots do all sorts of things. Its special in 2 ways (that are important to you).   1) It presents the examples as a website you click through, and hit run on the application to run the code example. You can copy and modify code bits and run them all in the built-in web browser. This makes for a smooth learning curve from no coding, to a little coding. The code bits are called ""scripts"" (groovy or python for those pro readers also reading this).   2) It connects hardware, and really neat built in libraries, to your scripts. We have built in libraries (Opencv) that do face tracking, control servos and led, read from sensors, and even talk to serious robot sensors later down the road. (I use it to build robots that perform surgery in the real world)  If you don't have any hardware yet, most of the features have virtual devices so you can make virtual robots with no risk of breaking anything, and no cost. The software is free and opensource, so you can do literally anything you want with it!"
robotics,3bv8ja,hephaestusness,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:49:23 2015 UTC,"In keeping with Lars0's advice I have to say to not be discouraged by ""failure"".  A am a robotics engineer with an undergrad in Robotics Engineering and almost 3 years of industry experience. At the level you are operating at, things are going to mostly be a ""assemble it, program it, try, fix what broke, make it better, retry, repeat."". This is FINE! This is also fun! While I totally understand and agree with the work that goes into doing all kinds of fancy modeling and mathematics for the robots I work on in my personal and professional time, it is admittedly a tad boring compared with the ""Screw it! Throw the lever and see what happens!"" methodology.  Start simple and work your way up. The field of robotics is a wondrous one, and a great one to be interested in. Never before has mankind been at a point where we can start making what really amounts to non-biologic artificial life. But that is basically where we are at now.  Robotics can be broken down into three main territories. Physical, Sensing, and Processing. All of these are needed in order to build a robot, but depending on what you are doing, one or more of these will be more important than the other. What I would recommend doing is start by going to https://www.servocity.com/ and looking at some parts. This is where I go to get parts for my rovers that I use in the NASA Sample Return Centennial Challenge. START SMALL! Robotics, unfortunately, can be a very expensive hobby/lifestyle. To date I have spent over $50K on robot parts and I'm always finding more I want. T-T  With the ServoCity gear things are great because it is easily reusable. First off, start by deciding on a chassis. You can go simple and choose one of their pre-generated ones as seen here: https://www.servocity.com/html/robots___accessories.html Or you can choose to try and start your own by getting a few pieces of channel, some nuts/bolts, motors/servos, motor/servo mounts, etc.  BUT! Be warned! This is the ""boring"" part of robotics. Once you have decided on parts, but before you bought them, you need to actually look at what you have chosen to make sure it is all compatible with each other. ServoCity is a bit more forgiving than ""real life"" in this regard (their parts tend to use a common hole pattern everywhere), but every time I decide to skip this step it bites me in the ass. One other big warning! The difference between a servo (AKA: servomotor) and a motor. A servo will take in a signal (a PWM signal usually, but not always between 0 and 255) and convert that into an ANGLE to move to. So going to 255 will have the servo move all the way to the 'right' and then stop. A motor will take that number and convert it to a SPEED to move at. So 255 will be 'clockwise' at full speed. So make sure your motors are motors and your servos are servos! Motors are good for driving the robot around, servos are good for doing things like arms.  Another part of starting small! Calculating things like torque can be easy or hard depending on the design of your robot. Torque is a measure of how much force this arm is going to have put on it just to hold its position. So if you want to have an arm with multiple joints (like your arm), then you are going to need to put some thought into making sure the servos will be strong enough to do the job. If a servo or motor is trying to move and is stopped (stalled) this is BAD! Instead of being a servo/motor it is now a HEATER! All that electricity is still going through it, but will start to melt important pieces of the servo/motor and WILL destroy it if you let it go long enough. This is also true for any servo/motor that is barely strong enough to do what you want it to.  But! If you start small with two powered wheels, an idler (a wheel with no motor) and then a simple pan/tilt 1 link arm with a claw, then you should be fine on the physical side. This is a good example of a kit: https://www.servocity.com/html/actobitty_2_wheel_robot_kit.html#.VZrZHxtViXk  Sensing can get crazy as well. This is where you figure out what you want your robot to be able to 'see'. What is usually a good introduction to this is to get line following sensors and try to take your simple robot and teach it to follow a path around the floor. A line following sensor consists of 3 white/black light sensors arranged in a 1x3 array. You will program the robot to keep the middle sensor blacked out, and if the left sensor blacks out then the robot should turn a little to the left, if the right blacks then turn to the right, etc. This is a great intro task to robotics.  If you have any further questions feel free to help. If you are in MA, I actually will be teaching some Intro To Robotics classes at a makerspace called Technocopia later this year.  Enjoy! And welcome to the club!"

robotics,3bv8ja,albatroopa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:01:38 2015 UTC,"As a start I would get yourself a micro-controller, which is basically a very small computer. There are lots of micro-controllers on the market and they are very cheap.   I would recommend the Raspberry Pi which is extremely well supported (and it's basically a full computer for around $35 and it's about the size of a credit card):   https://www.raspberrypi.org/   The micro-controller is the brain of any robotics project and you'll need to learn how program.   Common programming languages are C, C++, Python, C#, Java, etc.   C and C++ are the most powerful (and are used by the professionals), where as python, C# and Java (Minecraft was written in Java) are the easiest to learn.   You can get the software to write programs completely free off the internet. For example, Microsoft provide the excellent Visual Studio Express completely free and you can make your own programs that actually work. They also provide lots of tutorials to get you started.   After that, it depends upon what kind of robot you wish to build. There are literally 100's of robot kits out there to get yourself started with, so shop around on ebay and the like.   Whatever you are going to build you will need to learn how to solder and a range of various tools."

The series was aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block between October 2012 and March 2013. The story takes place in an authoritarian future dystopia, where omnipresent public sensors continuously scan the Psycho-Pass of every citizen in range. The sensors measure mental state, personality, and the probability that the citizen will commit crimes, alerting authorities when someone exceeds accepted norms. To enforce order, the officers of the Public Safety Bureau carry hand weapons called Dominators. The story follows Akane Tsunemori, Shinya Kogami, and other members of Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division, and the crimes they investigate using Dominators.

Two pilots probably means more articulation or operations. The Japanese robot could have more smarts built in and the same number but control capability of the operator is usually the limiting factor for my commercial automations. Human-machine interfaces are pretty bad and humans are really slow in switching attention.
robotics,3bndlp,BigSlowTarget,3,Wed Jul 1 02:50:50 2015 UTC,"Two pilots because one controls motion while the other targets weapons systems. The HUD may even things up, but otherwise 2v1 would lead to the Japanese bot being battered."

robotics,3bmqp7,jariza,3,Tue Jun 30 13:52:43 2015 UTC,"OOO, I am!   I recently released a long running research platform called BowlerStudio and the DyIO. It is a high-speed, distributed and real-time capable robotics development platform and IDE. I designed the software tools to be easily used by mechanical engineers (read not programmers) to build MRI compatible robotics systems. After realizing i had significantly improved the ease of use of the process of building robots, i repackaged this platform as a teaching tool for kids, to get them excited about programming through robots.  The cloud aspect comes in with the scripting system. Robot builders make scripts and host them in GitHub Gist, and the platform reads them live from the cloud service. Users can run other users scripts from inside their own, making robot coding collaborative.    Deeper in the system you see a much more sophisticated slud archetecture. We inverted the ROS client-server model and made each device a server. Instead of external libraries for devices, the server (device) self-describes all of its capabilities in-protocol as a deep introspection of functionality and packet formation is the initiating step for connecting a device. The direct advantage of this is the ""application"" is the controler of time, because it is the client to many servers. The protocol has a watchdog feature and can run real time, throwing exceptions it fiming parameters are breached. This means you can do full closed loop linear control in the protocol, without having to drop down to a separate real-time system that is out of protocol (the ROS real-time problem).   While starting from this robust low level, we added together with this a huge host of high level robotics tools, such as a D-H parameter auto-kinematics engine, OpenCV image processing (with win/mac/linux installers), Joysticks, LIDAR, 3d animation, Physics Engine, Motor simulation, and a full CSG based 3d CAD scripting library.   TL;DR: Ease of use like arduino, Sophistication like ROS, Real-Time kinematics BigDog"

I've wanted to see if they'd be good for a small biped.  I'm going the other way - I have a gearbox that only needs six 12mm bearings (6001zz) and a 250w brushless motor (D2830-11) and the rest is all 3D printed. It's large and it requires a custom brushless driver I am building now (will have full authority over FETs, current feedback, and a 64MHz cortex M3 that runs Arduino code and provides closed loop position control), but I've done tests with a normal ESC and the gearbox is very fast and very powerful.  It will need refining but I've started moving all my designs to OnShape so that they can be forked like github and worked on for free. I use a minimum of non-printed parts so designs can iterated on quickly.  I am hoping to build an open source biped with gears and motors all neatly integrated into the frame.  Anyway, I'm rambling.

robotics,3blrym,tlalexander,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:48:59 2015 UTC,"sounds awesome. fixed the video. are you using soft links to go from the box up top down into the limbs? for awhile i've thought that was the right way to go to keep weight centralized up top. when you have limbs that weigh so little, it lets you accelerate and decelerate them so quickly with much less lash, though i guess that all depends on not only your gearbox up top but also the kind of 'ligaments' you are using. got any photos? rambling is allowed!"
robotics,3blrym,tlalexander,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"I did take a load of pictures of the gearbox, I should get em on imgur.  I'm not using soft links, it's all hard 3D printed stuff. But with these high speed overpowered brushless actuators I think we can brute force it. I just need to make my nice motor controller so I can see if it is possible to take up backlash in software. Since it had current control I can do a high speed low torque move when I reverse directions to take up the slack, then sense when that happens and apply power as soon as the slack is gone.  But yeah, I hate servos and dynamixels aren't the answer. I came to that conclusion after seeing that it's $6000 in dynamixels to build the Poppy biped. I want to make a $200 biped that is a similar size to poppy, but it would take a lot of R&D to make some of the custom parts that would need."

Copied from another post I made recently:  TLDR; do some robot stuff that interests you, show it to a company.  After years of interest in robots, and after working at a job related to 3D machine vision in CT scanners, I did freelance and hobby robot stuff for awhile in the hope of building up a reputation to make getting in with a company easier. After iterating a few times on my own home-built KHR & ROS based platform, I eventually joined Aldebaran's NAO Developer Program and switched to that platform. At some point I had a few options open for a career path and chose Aldebaran because I want to make robots for people, not for industry or war.  I manage the ""Life"" team at Aldebaran, which is mostly concerned with the autonomy of the robot and the app framework that the developer uses to scales it.  Some of the stuff I worked on in the semi-distant past can be found on my YouTube channel. My own site has tons of info but is unfortunately down for the moment, I'm working on bringing it back up soon (maybe this month it'll happen).

Out of the box that's a fair summary.  Otherwise, think of it as the new developer platform.  For example, the other day I installed an app on Pepper that teaches my kid the ABCs.  My kid loves another app that tells stories.  If I wanted I could make an app that communicated with WIFI lighting controllers on the LAN, and I could tell Pepper to ""turn off the lights please"".   They can't carry the shopping or bring you your dinner   You could make an app to have him bring you dinner.  But you'd have to how to use the navigation APIs.  And Pepper's hands aren't so articulate or strong.  So the best you could do would probably be for him to hold a tray across his arms, and someone else loads it up, and he takes it to the other room.

robotics,3bhu0r,probotika,29,Mon Jun 29 10:02:12 2015 UTC,"Deere John,  While we appreciate your efforts and accomplishments at automating the tedious task of driving a tractor up and down the rows of crops, we must point out that driving on a street is a much more complicated task.  When driving in a field, there are no other vehicles to contend with, no traffic rules to obey, no obstacles to avoid.  A tractor, being constrained to low speed travel due to the implements it tows, has lots of time to react.  Weather, too, is not of much concern as crop maintenance is done when the weather is good.    Driving on the street requires being able to locate, interpret, and obey traffic signs.  Other vehicles are constantly in motion on the streets, and their behaviour is not always predictable.  In fact, it may violate traffic laws.  Pedestrians may dart out into our path at any time, and must be avoided.  Rain, snow, fog and other weather related phenomena must be dealt with, and all of these things have to be done at the speed of traffic."
robotics,3bhu0r,The_camperdave,20,Mon Jun 29 14:08:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm commenting here only because I feel you're trivializing the issue- it's not just that simple. Driving over unstructured terrain is a very complicated task, very often you can't observe the ground directly.  Forming apriori maps is also a pain because features you can use to localize (in this case, plants and natural scenery) keep changing.  Lastly, just because a tractor is supposed to work autonomously in the fields, alone, it doesn't mean that people won't happen to be in the vicinity. Whether people are there on purpose(farm workers) or by accident (people wandering through the fields), tractors need to be able to spot them in the foliage and react properly.   /rant  Edit: removed redundancy"
robotics,3bhu0r,friendzyme,8,Mon Jun 29 14:56:46 2015 UTC,"My understanding of John Deere's tech level is that it can steer a tractor in a straight line based on GPS coordinates.  It can also replicate a previous session (farmer trains the tractor the first time around, and the tractor repeats the motions).  It simply drives patterns.  Things like obstacle avoidance are left to the vehicle operator, a person in the cab overseeing things."

They're both extremely difficult challenges, the complexity shows up in different places.  For e.g. driverless cars would have operate at much higher speeds, but don't have to worry about whether the ground they're driving over is going to be stable or not. Tractors getting stuck in the mud is a real problem. This is just one of the million ways the two domains are different, even though they come under the umbrella of autonomy.  I apologize if I come across as annoyed, but this is a domain I am passionate about."

robotics,3bhu0r,sc14s,6,Tue Jun 30 06:33:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I thought that the general case with Deere automated tractors was that they relied on GPS rather than using feature localization and that they didn't (yet) have any method of avoiding people who get in their way.

robotics,3bh6ps,argh_minecraft,7,Mon Jun 29 04:45:21 2015 UTC,"If your technology is going to be weaponized, it's going to be weaponized in some form or another. It doesn't particularly matter where the funding originally comes from.  Weaponization and militarization are not primary goals of DARPA, despite what you might infer from their association with the Department of Defense. The truth is, the DoD is an organization whose funding is deep and secure because there isn't any congressman who wants to be seen as ""weak on terrorism"" (or in the past, ""weak on communism"", and in the future, ""weak on whatever is politically convenient to construe as our enemy""). By being associated with the DoD, DARPA has the ability to avoid the funding pitfalls that tend to hit organizations like NASA.  DARPA of course does fund military-oriented research, but that's not all they fund (in fact, I doubt it's even the majority of what they fund), and you don't have to worry about them desperately trying to militarize everything they do fund; they don't play that game. They are genuinely interested in funding technology for the general advancement of humanity, not just technology to oil up the war machine. If you get funding from them and they're not talking about militarizing it, they're not going to secretly go behind your back and militarize it.  Keep in mind that DARPA is the organization that invented the internet, and the organization that sparked the autonomous car craze that's been going on. While there's no denying that it's a part of the military-industrial complex, it's important to remember that the complex is ... complex. Most airplanes are made by Boeing, which is part of the military-industrial complex, but that shouldn't keep you from flying on planes out of fear that your money is fueling the oppression of Palestinians (the truth is, your tax money will be doing that no matter what).  So my advice is to be pragmatic and realistic. I don't see a point in passing up a golden opportunity to advance your research out of fear that you'll be contributing to military technology by several degrees of removal, especially when the truth is that just by being a tax paying American citizen you already contribute to warfare more directly than that."

If you want to make something more 'robotic' looking you can waterjet an aluminum plate or laser cut some acrylic plates - there are places online that will do this for you and ship you parts for reasonable cost. Or you can machine your own plates.

What you're suggesting, ordering a custom part, would require me to replace the entire top mounting plate of my chassis, and that'd be difficult. The chassis kit I ordered wasn't the best quality, and I had to JB Weld the servo horns in place. This pretty much means that they can't be removed at this point. How difficult is it to work with acrylic using hand tools? It looks like I can get some acrylic sheets at Home Depot, and if I can cut them to size, and drill holes in them, on my own then I should be good.  EDIT: After doing some Google'ing I'm learning that acrylic is another term for plexiglass. I looked at that today, and I have concerns about using that.

robotics,3bibpk,Necromunger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"Mental Health - obviously you start with Eliza (which a large number of people ""Turing Test Positive"" on from the day it was created nearly 50 years ago and scale up from there).  Occupational Therapist - perhaps not all but definitely this is where there is an intersection between robotic kinematics and kinesiology that is closely aligned with what much of occupational therapy is about.  Very, very automate-able for some cases with the measurement of movement against model against robot-assisted movement/stretching/etc.   Dentistry - Seriously this makes me wonder who made up the list.  This is one of the more automatable areas for the same reason as occupational therapy is.  Take robotic/telematic surgery and mix it with remote sensing/image processing.    Surgery - certain many aspects that are more experimental or uncommon will remain human but a ton of elective surgeries, not so much.  For medical diagnostics and general practice:  let's be clear about the facts on this:  the Mycin program had error rates equivalent to human doctors in the 1960s/1970s - it was merely on par with human doctor error rates and that was because of the ambiguity of symptomatic data collection and being merely no better meant no advantage.  That's a dubious barrier to entry.  Balanced against this: outsourcing - as it is I go to Thailand for most elective medicine because it's crazy cheaper than anything in the US.  Oral Surgery - again, far more automatable for the reasons above.  Diet/Nutritionist - OMG, are you kidding me?  Absolutely replaceable in the near future (10-15 years tops).  This is actually aligned with some tech I've been consulting on.  Elementary School Teacher - this I'd actually agree should never be automated but it will actually be one of the first to be because in the US, teachers are not respected.   All those iPads and computers in classrooms are Epic Fail (and I say this is a computer-using nerd going back to my teens in the 1970s) but the momentum is already there for the US.  Not so much other societies so there is that - you'll need to leave the US if you are a teacher.  School Psychologist - akin to teachers - you probably shouldn't but it can and will be.  See mental health.  Medical Scientist - yes and no.  This is finally one where there is a strong element of creativity that is core to technology itself that can't be replaced.  HOWEVER - one of the most manual, unautomated areas of all science is:  biotech and medical research.  Techs abound that can be eliminated and probably will be as this areas are almost pre-industrial in their lack of automation.  That will change.  Computer Systems Analyst - well, it depends on what you are defining this as.  As ""IT"" being a cost center - there is enormous pressure to eliminate that as a profession.  If you mean ""systems architecture/design consultant"" then yes, up to a point.   But there is the momentum to move away from this.  The list seems to be written by someone who isn't actually ""in the business"" of technology, automation and industry so they don't really know what's possible, what the economic and social forces are in place and what's already ""in the pipeline""."

Diagnoses, formulating plans and diets, fixing computers, these things are basically all flow charts.  But in reality all of these jobs are extremely, extremely personalized.  The automation chances are low because they require personal communication and motivation.    Social workers, psychologists, dieticians, teachers and therapists dont just prescribe pills, they provide motivation, advice and comfort.  It requires deep interpersonal skills and understanding of context and human interactions.  Same with dentists, doctors and surgeons.  Dentists don't just clean teeth, they make you brush your teeth.  System analysts dont just follow a flowchart or fix computers, they have to build habits in other people and create security through human actions.

So to say it's ""literally just a DaVinci robot with sufficient AI behind it"" makes it sound like that level of AI is right around the corner. It's not. What happens when this AI-infused da vinci is in surgery and something goes terribly wrong? it malfunctions, makes a mistake, etc.? Comes across something unexpected or that it's never seen before? I'm sorry, just don't ever us getting to that point. there's a big mental aspect to this, too. would you prefer a human or robot to operate on you?

Replace the set screw  4) Coupling is wrong size, maybe an 1/4"" imperial for a 6mm shaft or something. Get the right size  5) If you made the coupling yourself, you might have not given it the right amount of slop necessary. Look at this chart for what sizes are needed for the hole  6) If none of those are the issue, it could be that you need a different mechanical connection than a coupling.

There is controversy there but moving less mass usually costs less power and batteries are never big enough.  As for other similarities to humans, compatibility with existing human tools and structures mandates certain hand sizes, folding methods, body sizes, etc. Robot builders have to take door sizes into account when designing traveling units.

robotics,3bbiwp,BigSlowTarget,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"Bipedalism:       Bipedalism is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an organism moves by means of its two rear limbs or legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped /ˈbaɪpɛd/, meaning ""two feet"" (from the Latin bi for ""two"" and ped for ""foot""). Types of bipedal movement include walking, running, or hopping.  Few modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. Within mammals, habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times, with the macropods, kangaroo rats and mice, springhare,  hopping mice, pangolins and homininan apes, as well as various other extinct groups evolving the trait independently. In the Triassic period some groups of archosaurs (a group that includes the ancestors of crocodiles) developed bipedalism; among their descendants the dinosaurs, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the birds descended from one group of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs.  A larger number of modern species utilize bipedal movement for a short time. Several non-archosaurian lizard species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment. Several arboreal primate species, such as gibbons and indriids, exclusively utilize bipedal locomotion during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs whilst fighting or copulating. A few animals commonly stand on their hind legs, in order to reach food, to keep watch, to threaten a competitor or predator, or to pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally.

robotics,3bbiwp,doctordaedalus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"This is a great question. Getting a humanoid biped to balance appears to be a monumental task. I would guess that it would be easier to program for four legs rather than to program for balancing on two?    But when you set out to design something you have an application in mind. A humanoid robot only serves the purpose of looking like a human.  So it depends on the application. As a helper in the home, or customer service applications the humanoid biped makes sense. It's familiar and it won't scare grandma. Plus it rarely has to deal with complex terrain. But they should be kept small. Think - ASIMO.   For military/industrial quadrupeds or wheel/leg hybrids. Anything but bipeds? AIMEE - Red Planet. Boston Dynamics has several examples.   Anything that flies seems best suited to observation or very limited applications."

robotics,3b7o38,stowie1021,2,Fri Jun 26 17:06:12 2015 UTC,All 14 of them!?
robotics,3b7o38,Fahkfahkfahkfahkfahk,3,Sat Jun 27 01:47:12 2015 UTC,I don't think nursing should be on that list. The job requires tasks too complicated and interaction tasks that robots won't be providing probably until the time a robot could do literally any manual task (including those of the MDs). I think by the time nursing is on the list essentially any other job would be too.
robotics,3b7o38,MorboBilo,2,Sat Jun 27 14:55:59 2015 UTC,Good news for elementary school teachers I guess.
robotics,3b7o38,1dontpanic,2,Sat Jun 27 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with a few of these percentages or at least want a breakdown into finer categories. For instance retail salesperson is a pretty wide net. The drones at the cash, yes their days are numbered. The guy who sold me my mattress is safe.  Office clerks is another wide net. If their job is very drone-like then bye bye. But many office clerks have 1 zillion responsibilities that change all the time; they are safe. The same with the secretaries category; especially seeing that most secretaries that could be automated away were gone 10 years ago.  Then you get complicated ones like personal care aids. Yes there will be automation but there will also be an onslaught of elderly boomers so that will probably balance out.   But other ones such as nurses I think are more at risk. I have watched nurses at work and much of what they do is routine. The machines they seem to be using aren't helping much. So for instance I could see machines that deliver drugs and monitor patients far better than present nursing routines. Also part of many nurses' duties are administrative. With much of the patient interactions fully automated this will probably remove much of their administrative duties. There are still many things for nurses to do so this won't decimate their ranks but it will thin them out a bit as at least a few nurses worth of hours are spent on the drone-like routine.  Then Heavy equipment and tractor trailer truck drivers  is a terrible category because trailer truck drivers are pretty well going to go extinct. But heavy equipment operators are often called upon to do unusual things that won't be easy to automate. Road construction though should be far easier to automate.   Then the Laborers and freight movers category is again wrong. If they work in a large warehouse, then yes, gone. But people making heavy deliveries, moving houses, etc will be very hard to automate.   But then Combined food preparers and servers plus Restaurant waiters will have some bad impacts from automation yet fewer job losses in some cases. Just massive pay losses. I could see where food prep and food ordering is pretty much 99% automated. Simple job requirements will then only require that a human load ingredients into the machines and other humans might deliver meal #34 to table #25. The training might be under 5 minutes. Thus the pay will be very very low. The waiters will be far less likely to be tipped. Thus the remaining people with these jobs might as well not be considered to have the same job title.  But if food prep is fully automated it then causes an interesting commoditifcation of restaurants as how can any restaurant easily distinguish itself if the food prep is all 4 star cooking 100% of the time identical to any other restaurant with the same software and ingredients? Not impossible but interestingly hard."

robotics,3b6nl1,jdh30,2,Fri Jun 26 12:05:03 2015 UTC,Depends on the sensors and what the robot is doing. A roomba probably gets away with using cheap IR sensors but industrial robots may use laser range finders to map the metal frame and other laser sensors to ensure that humans aren't in the way.

robotics,3b3n1x,Portis403,7,Thu Jun 25 18:22:08 2015 UTC,"I used their demo system at the Underwater Intervention conference this year. It's not what I would call practical in any way, shape, or form. It spoke of something made by people who don't have a lot of experience with fielded robots or equipment, and who like working in controlled lab environments. Their whole architecture and basic underlying assumptions were centered on that. Couple of things to point out:  (1) Their system uses simulated haptic feedback only, not actual feedback generated from interaction with the world. It's not even designed for real haptics to replace it in the future. It only uses simulated haptics to provide virtual cues to an operator rather than giving them a sense of touch.  (2) It requires good, clean, dense 3D data, preferably from an area-scan sensor. This is difficult to get in the underwater world. They do all of their testing in ""clean"" environments using either Kinect / Primesense data on land or stereo data in clear water conditions. This would be terrible in turbid conditions, and line scan data would probably cause difficulty. Even good imaging sonars do not have good acoustic resonance on many material types and are also not terribly accurate for what they would need.  (3) It only works with known objects in very specific ways. They have no ability to operate with ""unknown"" things. Its current design is also intended to be a complete UI replacement, not any kind of ""assist"". Sensors not performing well? ID system having a bad day? Oh well...  (4) It has a lot of lag. As in on the order of seconds. It makes visual confirmation of motions useless since by the time you realize that the error in the data driving the system is off enough that your arm is plowing into something it's too late to pull back, and the system wouldn't register a corrective command in time anyway (and could probably make things worse). In general, humans make a lot of bad control decisions when there is lag (threshold for it influencing you is ~0.17s).  (5) Both after their talk and at their booth, they largely avoided answering any challenge questions, particularly ones that had to do with the systems impracticality and obvious limitations. Their general attitude was, ""You all just don't see how perfect this is."" It was very frustrating.  For reference, I have ~15 years experience in autonomous robotic systems, with the past 5 being focused on underwater robotics. Change is definitely (finally) happening in the ROV industry, I just hope it isn't too strongly driven by folks like this. It's a tough industry that can be highly resistant to change, and that has been known to reject whole areas of technology if the ""first"" someone doesn't do it right. They caused quite of bit of grumbling at the conference."

I have been playing with somthing similar in I'm trying to get my flight simulator to output to a autopilot for a UAV so I can program my real autopilot and test it in software.  For your application, are you envisioning the PC running the software has a joystick as well as your stewart platform controller?  If so, I would look at plugging the joystick into an Arduino, then mirroring the outputs out to a PC, and your stewart controller.  Getting the eulers out from most games probably isn't trivial.  X-Plan might have this, but it would be the only one off the top of my head that would expose this kind of thing.  Usually all of that is deep in the code and only becomes evident to the graphics.  You might be able to use a camera and some basic computer visoin to deduce angles based on the screen.  An aircraft model with an atrifical horizon could be a good place to start.  Point a webcam at the screen and do some tracking.  For racing games you may be able to do the same thing with a view that contains the steering wheel.  I don't know how precise these are compared to the actual input though.    These are some initial thoughts.  If you have any other ideas let me know.

It's unclear what you're trying to measure. Are you trying to measure shaft position on both a modified and unmodified servo or relative movement of a device containing servos?  If you just want to measure the servo's shaft position, you can open it up and solder a wire to the center pole on the internal potentiometer and connect that to an Arduino's analog input. The data will be a little noisy, but as the only cost will be a single extra wire, you won't find a cheaper option."
robotics,3av9od,TooSunny,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:43:47 2015 UTC,"I do need more precise positioning than an off the shelf servo using a closed loop can give me, and i definitely need feedback for the position. I am amazed how misaligned they can be from each other. I've read about doing the analogue input wire mod, and it did seem messy, but it may be the only option if i want to calibrate things well enough. I'm also using continuous rotation servos and would like better feedback for distance travelled, any DC motor i have looked at is too bulky once the encoders and gears are added on.   I'm a bit of a noob in this robot stuff, so thanks for the advice. I'm just trying to figure out the best and least complicated solution."
robotics,3av9od,acet1,2,Wed Jun 24 06:19:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, should have read this comment first. For steering, it looks like you need to make your own closed-loop control system as the servos just aren't cutting it.   I guess I should clarify what I meant earlier by ""closed loop control."" Closed loop control means that you're constantly monitoring the output of your system, and ""closing the loop"" by feeding the error between what it does and what you want back into the controller to make corrections. With a servo, you tell it to go to an angle (Arduino specifies a number from 0 to 180, which works nicely with a 180 degree servo, but the your chosen servo's actual travel is irrelevant). Inside the servo is a potentiometer which reads the position of the output shaft and compares it to the angle you specified, and the controller basically gives the motor more power when it's further away and less power when it's closer to the desired value.   The reason you don't want a shaft encoder and a servo is that ""shaft encoding"" is supposed to be the servo's job. If you have to tell it to go further because it's not keeping up with what you want, something's wrong, and you're probably running the servo too close to its limit. You should just start with something more robust.  But you still need closed-loop control. There are two ways you could go about this. You could either A) find a bigger servo, or B), do it yourself. Servos stop being economical and practical in nearly all but the smallest sizes, so I'll assume you want to go with option B.   Do you know how much torque is required to turn your steering modules? This is where you need to start. Also, how much power do your drive wheels need to have? The answers to these questions will help inform what kinds of motors you should be looking for.   Personally, I'm a big fan of using VEX stuff in these kinds of projects. It's a little bit pricy, but the dependability more than makes up for it. They even have continuous shaft encoders with 100 ticks per revolution. That should be more than enough for your needs.  Anyway I hope that's not an incoherent mess. Let me know if you have any questions or if this helps you understand what your original question should be."

robotics,3av9od,acet1,2,Wed Jun 24 00:24:53 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to use servos and encoders together. The whole point of a servo is to have a system that takes care of closed-loop control for you. If you need any customization on the control loop whatsoever, it's likely that the control loop in a servo is insufficient for your needs. What exactly are your needs? Aside from needing something that integrates with a servo? What are you using this for?"

It might be that the servo potentiometer isn't high enough resolution for your needs, but I highly doubt that's the case. It more likely that the motors inside the servos aren't powerful enough to accurately position themselves to the degree you need. Or it could be something else entirely. Without knowing more about what you're trying to accomplish, it's difficult to make hardware recommendations.

robotics,3as5lt,Maglgooglarf,7,Tue Jun 23 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"One of the things that was really impressive was the way robosimian exited the car. There was a lot of really cool-looking motion planning going on there. For movements like that, how much of it was ""canned"" or pre-planned? For similar movements in different environments, how long would you have to prepare to be able to replicate such motion? And as being the person telemanipulating the robot, what sort of commands did you have to give?  More broadly, I'm interested in what sort of ""autonomy"" you guys have given the robot and where that fits into user-generated commands. My own work is mainly with manipulators so teleoperation is simply about controlling end-effector position and orientation which can be done in a pretty straighforward manner with something like a phantom omni or similar. For some of these more complicated tasks, doing that for multiple legs is obviously not feasible. How does gait generation/path planning work? Can you give a command like ""grab wheel with right arm"" and you have ""wheel"" somewhere defined from the optical profile of the valve wheel? Or is it more low-level?  These are pretty broad questions, but I'm curious for an overview if possible."
robotics,3as5lt,dom100n,9,Tue Jun 23 02:31:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words about our egress. Egress consisted of 'course waypoints', which were pre-determined sets of joint angles that we first determined in simulation and then experimentally tweaked to get us out of the car. So these were 'canned', but a non-linear planner on the robot would generate trajectories to get from one waypoint to the next. Egress was particularly challenging to develop because of the physical constrains of the vehicle, but it was important to us that we get it to work on an unmodified Polaris. We spent about a month developing it. For different/unknown environments I would say it really depends on the complexity of the motion problem you are trying to solve.   Per your broader questions, our system was entirely supervised autonomy. But the ratio of operator command vs autonomy varied based on the task. I can give you a few examples. Driving was much more on the operator side of things. We drove by sending discrete throttle and steering commands, with the ability the vary the throttle hold time / trim (i.e. how far to press in the pedal) and the steering angle. The robot just translated these requests into limb motions. I talked a bit about egress already, but operationally it was the easiest task. Since it was all predetermined, we would essentially just hit 'request plan for the next N waypoints', preview the plan if we so desired, then hit 'execute'. Valve is something more in the middle of the road in terms of command vs autonomy. We would drive to a pre-determined pose that we knew gave us good reachability and visibility of the valve. The perception operator would 'fit' the valve by clicking a series of points on the valve in the image. Range data was used to interpret where the valve existed and how it was oriented in the 3D world based on these points. We then sent a command to execute our 'valve open' behavior, which would extend the fingers, align with the valve, go to touch, rotate, retract, then move the fingers back again.   In terms of gait generation, we have a few different walking algorithms. But the basic idea is you request a gait cycle (all four limbs taking one step), and indicators pop-up in the 3D world to represent the best guess as to where the limbs will land. The operator can tweak the gait cycle to either yaw or translate these expected footsteps. The same non-linear solver used in egress is used to generate the motion profiles."
robotics,3as5lt,uzunyusuf,4,Tue Jun 23 02:56:29 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Motion Planning Algorithms,  in your opinion, did you used ""state of the art"" algorithms? I mean, how is academia literature related with what you do?"
robotics,3as5lt,uzunyusuf,4,Tue Jun 23 13:05:50 2015 UTC,"We used several different motion planning algorithms depending on the context of the problem. I'd say some are state of the art, some have been around forever, and some were novel. For single limb manipulation we often used Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRTs) which are well documented in literature. Manipulation of actual objects, like the valve or door handle, relied heavily on inverse kinematics. For whole body planning, like egress and walking, we used the nonlinear solver which is a novel approach. We also have the ability to do this using a quadratic program, which is another novel approach developed by a graduate student at CalTech."

robotics,3as5lt,katieM,4,Tue Jun 23 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"Our operator control software consisted of a graphical user interface with various widgets. It varied based on the current task how the operator would specify the commands to the robot. It could be through buttons on the GUI or on the keyboard. Back to the polaris driving example, we would press a 'throttle' button in the GUI every time we wanted to accelerate the car. The operator computer would send this command to the robot through our network management software. Once received by the robot, the command and it's associated arguments (hold time and trim in this case) would get dispatched the appropriate software module on the robot to handle the request. The specific software module would then translate the request and execute the appropriate action, which in this case was to move a certain limb forward onto the pedal. The same general sequence of events occurred in similar fashion for all commands."

Log out from driving position. 6. Step out from car. 7. Move to the door in given location. 8. Other commands goes on...  Of course those example I gave, only human readable form and may be only for car example these number of steps are 70, not 7.  So as you explain the scenario I started thinking how jury understand that a team is not cheating. May be somebody sends extra parameters (lets say over-learned) to their robot from their network management software. Just curios."
robotics,3as5lt,boringkorean,7,Thu Jun 25 23:37:13 2015 UTC,Any advice for an aspiring roboticist?
robotics,3as5lt,boringkorean,15,Tue Jun 23 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"My biggest piece of advice would be to get as much hands on experience with robots as possible, in whatever shape or size you can find. Robots come in all forms to accomplish all kinds of different things, but many of the core challenges that people who work on them deal with are all the same. So whether its FIRST or a research project for a professor or a job at a company that makes factory automation equipment it is all relevant, and will help shape what you want to do with your career. I'd also suggest staying as broad as possible in terms of which aspects of robotics you focus on, at least at first. I think the people who make the best roboticists are those that understand the entire system - not just the mechanical design, or the low level position controller, or the perception system - but the whole thing. Nobody is an expert on every aspect of robotics, but having a basic understanding of the elements that compose the robot means you do a better job implementing whatever part of the system you are responsible for."
robotics,3as5lt,Russell016,5,Tue Jun 23 03:11:43 2015 UTC,What did you have to study to be on the team?  what software did you use?
robotics,3as5lt,Badmanwillis,19,Tue Jun 23 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"My educational background is an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in mechanical engineering with a focus on control systems. I took courses and did projects related to mechatronics throughout both degrees, which laid a great foundation for robotics. Programming, electronics, control systems, and mechanical design were all key components of this. In between my undergrad and grad I did a year long internship at a robotics company that designed exoskeletons for paraplegics. This helped me understand what the state of the art of robotics was, and what the main limitations were, which helped me focus my graduate studies. To be on Robosimian specifically, I was asked to join because at JPL I had developed experienced developing and implementing control systems on robotic arms in support of flight work. This involved studying concepts like kinematics and force control, as well as understanding how to interface with the motors and sensors on these systems. All of this background is what led me to being part of the team.   EDIT: Woops missed your second question. In terms of software that we used, it was all written at JPL. We programmed the robot almost exclusively in C and C++. We run linux, and use many of the open source packages that come with this OS."

I think controls is nice not so much because of the material (though that is helpful) but because to really understand and apply controls you need to understand the whole system. And that is what mechatronics is all about, and what I believe robotics is all about as well.   For projects I did the controls/programming/electronics for a CNC plasma cutter that we built as my team's senior design project. I also did formula SAE for one year. My master's research was on model based control of an automotive engine. This may seem orthogonal to robotics, but a lot of the core concepts are the same: sensing, state estimation, controls, working with hardware, real-time programming etc."

But I would also highly suggest doing research on paralysis so you've got a good grasp on what the robot needs to do, because it is not simple. Try to think outside the box if you can. I think there are a lot of fundamental issues with many of the products out there and this is still very much an unsolved problem.

I work on the algorithms and software for the sample caching subsystem, which will be the part of the rover responsible for coring into rock and collecting the samples.

robotics,3as5lt,Absurdulon,2,Tue Jun 23 02:31:09 2015 UTC,As a part of my job I have suffered countless instances of joint reachability issues and IK singularities. and this with just your run of the mill 6 axis arms. How did you guys manage to implement a robust IK/path planner?
robotics,3as5lt,Badmanwillis,4,Tue Jun 23 13:06:20 2015 UTC,"This is something that certainly took some time to sort out, and the large bulk of it was done before I joined the team. The end result though was that we used a variety of IK solvers (both numerical and analytical) and motion planners depending on the context of the problem, as opposed to a one-size-fits all approach. Robosimian's limbs each have seven degrees of freedom, so that gives us redundancy in posing the end effector which helps the path planning/reachability problem quite a bit. We found one of the best ways to avoid reachability/singularity issues was to try to find a path through the whole expected motion and if the given solver could not, it would respond back to the operator with a failure. Then it was up to the operator to determine how to get a solution, potentially by moving the mobility base to get better reach, using a different limb, etc. This gets more challenging when your motion plan has reactive elements to it, meaning the way you move the limb is going to be dependent on forces and torques imparted by the environment, since it can be difficult to predict where and how these will occur. For manipulation behaviors (like turning the valve) we would specify where we expected to make contact with the object based on the perception information. This gave the planner means of determining if it was reachable or not, and sending the failure back to the operator if it wasn't. If the planner succeeded, the operator had the ability to preview the plan before telling the robot to execute it, which was also quite helpful.  On the electrical switch surprise task on Friday's run we actually did run into reachability issues. We positioned the end effector parallel to the ground and made contact with the top of the box to get depth information. The plan was to move the end effector up and to the right after this to position it over the switch. But we didn't have the reach to do this and the IK planner kept failing the request. So I tried using an RRT, since sometimes you can get that last little bit of reach by solving in joint space which is agnostic to singularity. But the RRT was trying to flip the shoulder to get reach, which we could see from the plan preview would have driven the end effector straight into the wall. So in the end we tilted the end effector back (instead of keeping it parallel with the ground) to get the reach, then moved it up, then yawed the whole mobility base to swing it to the right to position it over the switch. But all of this was simply due to the fact that we are rather low down when we are on our wheels, and the switch was mounted at a good height for a standing humanoid, so it was just barely within our reach and thus we were on the fringes of what the solvers could give us."
robotics,3as5lt,boringkorean,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:49:28 2015 UTC,we tilted the end effector back   Nice! You won't believe that I too learnt this the hard way after spending a week on the floor with an ABB robot. Turns out that it's an industrial standard to mount the tool at a roll or pitch offset so that it goes through the singularity holes!

robotics,3as5lt,ShadowRam,5,Tue Jun 23 02:02:16 2015 UTC,"It was stressful, exciting, and exhilarating. It was the culmination of so many hours of work by an amazingly dedicated team. I only joined the project in February of this year, but many members of the team, particularly on the hardware side, had been working on Robosimian for 3 years. Being lead operator was definitely an interesting position. But it was hard not to feel like any mistake that I or the operations team made would be a let down to our team, to JPL, and to everyone who had supported us along the way and who were counting on us to do a good job. I think it was the build up and anticipation of the run that made these aspects worse. Once the run actually started, for me all the stress subsided. This is in large part because we had practiced over and over back at JPL and knew exactly how we were going to approach each task. We pulled off a great run on Friday - in fact, it was just about as good as we could hope for - and that allowed everyone to breathe a lot easier that night. Saturday's run was not as good as I would have hoped, and there are definitely things I wish I had done differently. But knowing we had the solid Friday run behind us and that we came in the top 5 in the end made us all quite pleased."
robotics,3as5lt,omniron,2,Tue Jun 23 02:12:49 2015 UTC,How come you got to be the lead operator even though there were more experienced team members?
robotics,3as5lt,Zulban,4,Tue Jun 23 02:16:17 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately in between the DRC trials and the finals we had a lot of staff turnover. The people who had been operators before had moved on to other organizations. It was actually this outflux of people that led to me and several others being asked to join the team. Our software lead (Sisir Karumanchi) would have been a logical choice. But he very selflessly decided it'd be best to let people who had not had such an opportunity before be the operators. I think he picked me because since starting I had spent the most time working  with the robot (second to him). We also had two co-pilots: one who was our perception lead and so thus was our perception operator (Ian Baldwin), and another who was our camera lead (Jeremy Nash). Jeremy had a procedure in his hand for each task and his job was to make sure we didn't skip any steps. The person who wrote our networking software (Brian Satzinger) was also there to monitor the health of the links and give us status updates as needed. All of us joined Robosimian in February or later."

robotics,3aqa8b,KnightOfAshes,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:04:43 2015 UTC,It's really unclear what the end goal is or if they are even making progress.  I am disspointed as hell they haven't done any spacewalks with it.
robotics,3aqa8b,Lars0,2,Tue Jun 23 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"To be fair to my former coworkers, the actual usage of Robonaut is not their fault. I think they could have delivered something similar with a lower budget, but after completion of R2, Constellation was dismantled, which both Robonaut and the SEV were connected to budget-wise. So they went from needing to trim the budget a bit to having no budget at all (which is why I and several - much better and more intelligent I might add - other interns were not invited back the next summer) and to add insult to injury, every branch of the government outside of the Air Force/DOD went through an anti-robot phase. All the glamorous plans for Robonaut were gone overnight because of overcautious bureaucrats and politicians with misplaced priorities. So plans changed. Instead of going up with the Exorcist legs, it was decided it would be ""safer"" for the budget to send it up as a torso. It cannot spacewalk with either the single leg or the Exorcist legs, so until one of those gets flown up (unlikely with current budget and space restrictions in the Dragon capsule) it isn't ever going to spacewalk. And now, 4 years later, priorities have shifted. The boys and girls of ER4 have finally figured out that their stuff is never going to be used correctly in space, as much as they wish it would. Hence Valkyrie."

robotics,3aozmc,hareshmiriyala,3,Mon Jun 22 09:20:03 2015 UTC,"It's easy to do.  For one (x, y) fixed point, you can easily deduce the rotational angle of the base (if your robot doesn't move, of course). Then, the distance between the base and your (x, y) point dives you the two other angles."
robotics,3aozmc,Narthseg,3,Mon Jun 22 10:16:25 2015 UTC,"Since it's a fairly limited range, you may be able to find a closed form solution, which I believe is what Narthseg is suggesting.  More generally, IK generally involves solving an optimisation problem; that is, minimise the distance between the end effector and the objective, while staying within the (often linear) constraints. Note that I think this is probably best looked at a quadratic optimisation problem.  This is the approach b10nic84 is more suggesting. I don't know how much calculus is really involved though, especially if solving numerically.   The first link b10nic84 is a good background to the maths; however, if you're already on a computer, why bother with C and doing all the matrix stuff by hand? I have here (mirror ) a briefer overview of the maths, and python code which I think is reasonably modular.  Good luck."
robotics,3aozmc,Jak-o-Shadows,2,Mon Jun 22 11:38:08 2015 UTC,Ben Greer has a pretty good write up. The basic idea is to do gradient descent on the angles of the arm until you find a solution. How good is your calculus?
robotics,3aozmc,b10nic84,2,Mon Jun 22 10:13:13 2015 UTC,"i can't think in terms of calculus, but can solve any decent numerical problem ."
robotics,3aozmc,b10nic84,3,Mon Jun 22 12:58:58 2015 UTC,"Okay I will give it a go as much as a reddit comment will allow.  I will assume you can formulate a function for the reverse of what you are trying to do, that is if I give you three joint angles, theta1, theta2 and theta3, you would be able to calculate the x,y,z of the tool tip.  We call this function F(). The function should have the form:  robots position = (x,y,z) = F(theta1, theta2, theta3)  So what we are trying to do is run this function backwards. It maybe possible to do this analytically and get an exact solution for theta1, theta2, theta3, but maybe not. So what we can do is solve it numerically.  First we need a cost function to minimise. In this case the appropriate function is the distance between the current (x,y,z) of the tool tip and the desired target position, say (a,b,c). If we can bring this cost to 0, the robot will be at the desired point in space. Pythagoras theorem in 3 dimensions will give us the distance between two points (x,y,z) and (a,b,c) so our cost function C() is:  cost = C(a,b,c,x,y,z) = Sqrt((x-a)2 + (y-b)2 + (z-c)2 )  If we take the robots current position, given as F() we can find our current cost, that is how far we are currently from our desired position.   current_cost = C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3))  Okay, I hope you are still with me. Using calculus we calculate the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to the variables theta1, theta2, theta3. These partial derivates are just numbers, there are three of them, one for each variable (the three theta's). They represent how much our cost changes with respect to a small change in the variable. Calculus allows us to write these exactly, but you can calculate them numerically as an approximation. If we call these three numbers delta1, delta2 and delta3, they are as follows:  delta1 = (C(a,b,c,F(theta1 + h,theta2,theta3)) - C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3))) / h  delta2 = (C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2 + h,theta3)) - C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3))) / h  delta3 = (C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3 + h)) - C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3))) / h  You can find these formulas on the wikipedia entry for Derivative. These are just approximations, but as h gets smaller and smaller the approximation will become exact. For your purpose just set h = 0.0001, and your approximation will be close enough.  Okay so we are nearly there. Intuitively what we do now is adjust theta1, theta2 and theta3, a small step at a time, such that it minimises our cost function.   So write some code that does this:  theta1 = current theta1 angle;  theta2 = current theta2 angle;  theta3 = current theta3 angle;  step = 0.1;  h = 0.0001;  // iterate the procedure until we are 'close enough', in this case within 1cm of our target position.  while C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3)) > 1cm    // calculate our derivatives  delta1 = (C(a,b,c,F(theta1 + h,theta2,theta3)) - C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3))) / h;  delta2 = (C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2 + h,theta3)) - C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3))) / h;  delta3 = (C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3 + h)) - C(a,b,c,F(theta1,theta2,theta3))) / h;  // update our theta's in the direction that minimises our cost  theta1 = theta1 - delta1*step;  theta2 = theta2 - delta2*step;  theta3 = theta3 - delta3*step;  loop  return (theta1, theta2, theta3);  The returned thetas should get you within 1cm of the target position. And that is it. Reverse kinematics via numerical gradient descent in a nutshell."

Every doctor's office has a machine that takes the prescriptions relayed from the computer on the doctor's desk and proceeds to generate ""per dose"" packets of all the meds required: each interval indicated you simply open a plasticine packet - never do you need to read the bottle (no bottles used) and do the math on when exactly you need to take something.    It both cuts out the pharmacist as middle man (from whom you only go for chronic meds - they also have such a machine).  There are are also far more ""over the counter"" meds (e.g. codeine) which simplify the process of medicating yourself.  Part of the reason these guys can jumpstart this is because such machines have existed in Japan for 20+ years; it's a mature technology and the costs have been amortized so standard ""new technology premiums"" don't exist.     Basically the US, if they adopt these, is jumping technology adoption just like Asia did by skipping land-line phones and jumping to cellular.

robotics,3ai472,TooSunny,3,Sat Jun 20 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"I opted for a 21AH sealed lead acid battery   Yikes, there's one of your problems. I understand your desire to use them as ballast, but I didn't think anyone still used SLAs anymore. While rummaging through some stuff, I came across a couple old 12V and just threw them out because they're practically worthless now for robotics. Mobile platforms need to be very efficient with their resources and SLAs are anything but efficient.  SLAs have a max theoretical energy density of about 40 watt-hours/kg.  NiMH batteries, which are a more modern technology, have a max theoretical energy density of about 100 watt-hours/kg.  Lithium-Polymer batteries, which are pretty much state-of-the-art for hobbyists, have a max theoretical energy density of about 265 watt-hours/kg.  So you're basically adding a huge amount of dead weight to your robot by using SLAs. Replace it with an appropriately sized LiPo, and just that alone might reduce the weight enough to remove all sag. You can find 10AH LiPo batteries for about $50 that weigh in at a staggering 300g.  Personally, I'd try to engineer it so it doesn't need so much ballast just to stay upright, but if you really want to go that route, then double up on LiPos. That way you'll have the battery life to haul around that much weight."
robotics,3ai472,TooSunny,3,Sat Jun 20 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"I had considered using a LiPo originally, I use them a lot with other projects. My main reason for going with the SLA instead was the ease of use, you don't need to be quite so careful of over discharging an SLA.   Also you'd be surprised at how essential the ballast is. I had an earlier prototype with a much lighter battery that would happily tip over going over small bumps in a carpet. Of course I could increase the footprint of the base to balance this out but this makes navigating autonomously through narrow doorways so much more complicated."

robotics,3ai5xo,live_love_laugh,7,Sat Jun 20 12:17:23 2015 UTC,"I think the nicest language to start in would be swift.   Down the road Swift might reach out to more platforms, but at the moment it's basically iOS only. You'd be doing a bit of a disservice to education by locking new students into a single platform like that.  Pick whatever it is most people use now, you might not like the language, but your students will love the vast ecosystem and community."
robotics,3ai5xo,Eoinoc,2,Sat Jun 20 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"Not swift, but how about Java, Groovy or Python? I use BowlerStudio to teach Java to kids. Its a robotics development system and lets you hook up servos and sensors with webcams and real image processing like face tracking or blob detect. Therse is a nice USB controller you can use called the DyIO that adds hardware to your code with event listeners. It also lets you control 24 servos, I/O, analog, serial all sorts of stuff.   What's nice about learning this platform as opposed to arduino or lego is that it is also used to make real robots, one that is performing surgery in fact. That way you can be sure as they grow up with it, they will never be held back by the platform."

The other commenter might equally argue that learning a robot API locks them into that particular robot kit, right?  That argument will exist no matter what you start them with.  The bigger issue is how to give them a good start—they will expand from there, 'lock in' is a lesser concern to approachability and motivation.  Really the debate should be on Swift's merits as a First Language.  Anyway, there are quite a few robot kits with C or Objective-C (and therefore Swift) APIs.

Of course it's fine for us to be betting (whatever it is we're betting, reddit karma?),  but it's not fine for a teacher to bet with their students time.

Which is what I said, Swift is a poor first language because the community and ecosystem are too small at the moment. Students want those things now so that they can get stuck in straight away.   I disagree, they have Apple's whole ecosystem.  And everything that's been done for ObjC is directly accessible in Swift.  There's quite a lot there.  But it's also somewhat moot—for OPs purposes, all they (should) need is the syllabus, and they'll be doing a specific robot application anyway, not full app development—but it's nice to be able to scale into that later.

For wireless control, bluetooth is also a good choice and you can connect to your cell phone. The reason for why we use nRF24L01 is that it is much lower cost....  We've notice many makers want to get engaged in the robotics field. But in the course they came across many problems.    Driver. It needs high power to drive 12 or 18 servos at the same time. Then you may need to use a breadboard to hook up all the components including the 12 or 18 servos, bluetooth (if you use), the Mega, DC module, which will make the robot a huge size. Also the wires may get into a mess since there are so many… Programming. Before the release, we've received lots of emails. People inquired about the movement control. We watched their videos of making the robots. And we found that the biggest challenge for them is the problem of smooth movement. So it would be difficult to make the sketch for a beginner in programming.  Other details. Appreciate your sufficiently rich equipment with all those things! We can provide the CAD diagram for you to make the robot body. But you need to pay attention to the material selection and precision during the cutting. It may take a long time to produce all those parts.  Power supply. Since the 12 or 18 servos need a high power, Lithion batteries are recommended for they are of high capacity and can supply high power. Among them, 18650 is better for its universal use. You can get it almost everywhere.    Hope these tips may help. We are not only doing this for selling stuff. What we want is to make open source much easier and lots of fun!

robotics,3af8r1,ipeerbhai,2,Fri Jun 19 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"This geometry for an arm has been used extensively in the semi conductor industry for handling wafers.    ... making an arm that could work like a 3d printer at home seemed like a fallacy.   I think budget would be more of a limiting factor rather that workspace. Between my self and two friends, our garages contain more production and inspection capability than some small machine shops.   Do you have a link to the video? The kick starter page don't show one, the website just has a 3d printing demo.    They mentioned they hand-packed and loaded their bearings.   With out context I say so what, I hand pack the bearings for a 10 ton truck, I'm not going to use those for a robot. That doesn't mean anything.    Any idea on how I can create a joint that will minimize unintended motion on the hinge?   Its all about getting the geometry right. Off the top of my head I would suggest a pair of opposing angular contact or roller bearings, top and bottom of the arm.  You will need a way to adjust the pre-load on them."
robotics,3af8r1,m37driver,2,Fri Jun 19 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"The secret to bearings without wobble is pre-loading them.  Inside a bearing there are balls and the raceway.  Bearings are made to have very little runout, that is, when the bearing is assembled, there is close to no space between the raceway, ball, and outer race, moving radially.  However moving axially, the balls are not perfectly constrained, as this would be much harder to make.  In order to close that gap you have to push the inner and outer races away from each other, like this.  This will make the bearing stiff with regards to axial deflection.  Preloading bearings is standard practice in any precision or tool design.  Alternately you can also use roller bearings, which have higher stiffness.  Preloading is something you work into a design, not really something you can just buy.  I could draw some pictures if you don't get the idea, I couldnt really find any good ones online.  If you want more information on the arm, its a SCARA type."

robotics,3a6mgt,SleepWouldBeNice,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"Loading of raw parts for painting is fully manual and today performed as follows:  Operators have to take raw parts from the box and fix it on a rack that is used to move the parts through the paint shop. Dimensions of the racks are the same for all parts, but fixing points and quantity of parts per rack are individual for each part. Parts must be loaded on both sides of the rack, however the conveyor is not equipped in turn station  (see attached documents). In the worst case there are 54 parts/rack. Conveyor is moving with a fixed speed of 1,4 m/min, including gap between racks, it give a loading time per rack of 60 sec. However average quantity of loaded racks per hour is around 45 due to color changes and some downtimes. Therefore, a potential option of off-line loading can give additional time if buffer of loaded racks is considered. Parts must be loaded very precisely in order to guarantee the same position (distance, angle etc.) for painting robots. And those parts must be tightly held on the racks to avoid falling down during the painting process."

robotics,3a4kvv,tlalexander,3,Wed Jun 17 06:36:43 2015 UTC,"So you have two servos in parallel on the ""leg"" and one on the shoulder. This lets it go in, out, up, down, and swing forwards or backwards.  Like this: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_N2A2k5iskoQ/THDXee0j7cI/AAAAAAAAA3o/oCYtNYpgsXw/s1600/Amigo_Hexapod_Leg_03.png  To walk, start with something called an ""alternating tripod gait"", where you treat the six legs like two sets of three and alternate moving them. Basically take the two on the front and rear right side and the one on the middle left side and they're one set. Lift them all up, move them forward, and then move them down. Lift up the other three legs and then move those forward while the ones on the ground move back. That will move the robot forward. Repeat.  As far as moving the legs, you can do a little by just finding rough servo positions for each step of the gait and you can make it walk. That may be a good place to start once you've got it all built. A more robust solution however involves calculating the ""inverse kinematics"" of your legs. That is, what are the angles A, B, and C needed for each servo to make the tip of the leg (the foot) go to some arbitrary X, Y, Z position. Inverse kinematics lets you specify a position in Cartesian coordinates and get the angles needed for your servos. Then you can write beautiful walking algorithms where the legs move in straight lines, etc.  I built an 18 dof hexapod about 12 years back and I've been building robots ever since, so if you have any questions I'm happy to help."

Atlas has a 3.7 KWh battery, so that means they're claiming that atlas can walk only 114 to 172 meters on it's battery.  Atlas ran for at least an hour at the DRC, so in order to walk 172 meters, it would have to move at 0.048 m/s, or 0.032 m/s to go 114 m. We know this is false, because team HKU walked their atlas down the driving course at DRC in about half an hour.  And the 2.05 km walk was without arms, perception sensors, etc. Remove this weight and power consumption from atlas and this efficiency claim is even more suspect.  Additionally, they claim the robot used an average of 350 watts while walking. 350 watts for 2 hours and 35 minutes is about 900 watt hours, not even close to 2.2 KWh. If it consumed 2.2KWh in 2.58 hours, average power was closer to 850 watts. Even if their system could only make use of half the power in the batteries, the numbers don't add up.

W/kg/m?  Terrible reporting.    If you do the actual math, a CoT of 1 over 10km @80kg works out to 7.84 MJ, or 2.17 kwh.  10km at the robots speed should take 12 hours 37 minutes, so it would use 172 watts, which is half their reported use.  The math is rotten all through; if you derive the CoT for their test assuming the 350 watts is right, it gives you a CoT of 2.0, not 1.5.  If you assume they used the whole battery, you get a CoT of 5.  Being generous and assuming that they used 500 watts of computer power, and didn't count that, theres still a 25% discrepancy between what they claim the CoT is and what it actually is, and implying that the robot could ever actually walk 10km is dishonest.

Interesting facts: ASIMO has a CoT of 3.23, and passive walkers have a CoT of .20- its reasonable to assume that this is essentially the minimum for walking, which means that humans are practically perfect walking machines.

Endgame: make food, dress you, turn on lights, fetch things, take care of stuff.  The form factor shrank and the capabilities never really grew.  As a robotics platform its more about being unobtrusive than capable.  Mechanically, its practically done.  Having a more capable robot would actually be a downside.  You don't want your butler running around the house or being stronger than he needs to be.  So the robotics slowed and gravitated towards the small form factor and development concentrated on software.  Improved voice recognition that can hear and understand several people talking at once, gesture recognition, multiple languages, personal touches.   It shares a few things with darpa robots, but only by coincidence.  It recognizes and avoids obstacles, including moving ones; it will recognize the direction people are walking and choose a path that isnt in their way.    It also pulls a few clever tricks.  It ""runs"", but only technically.  If you watch it in slow motion, its actually hopping from foot to foot.  Its jogging speed, high energy, and loud, but way simpler than actually running.  It uses a laser scanner, but its hidden in the torso and used for ground mapping.  Unlike ATLAS or other robots, it uses the camera for its primary object interaction, and the scanner is only for the world.  Avoidance and detection is done with ultrasonics.  Its an elegant approach driven by the desire for subtlety, instead of the brute-force approach ($25k laser scanner for a head)."

I very much doubt that Honda has ""solved"" any of the problems, and simply been silent on the matter."
robotics,3a1p93,amplitudeomega,4,Tue Jun 16 21:36:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have a real, hard answer. But here's an interesting question: if Honda thought that ASIMO could compete, then why would they not enter into the challenge?"
robotics,3a1p93,sirseal,4,Tue Jun 16 20:24:55 2015 UTC,Maybe because they don't want to support the military (directly or indirectly).  I know Tokyo University didn't want to because of this. Team Shaft was actually founded from ppl who left Tokyo University because the school wouldn't allow them to compete.
robotics,3a1p93,boringkorean,3,Wed Jun 17 04:54:35 2015 UTC,"That's a very interesting idea! Honda must have considerable ties with the Japanese military (""self defense forces"" ?) as it's one of the country's major source for domestic technology.

Nobody had amazing software."

And the DRC was more about autonomous action and low bandwidth control than it was about motion control.  Yeah, it's easy to program a robot to grab A drill from a fixed position, but the exact drill position isn't known. And Asimo wouldn't be at a fixed position. Asimo designers likely wouldn't have done much better than the robots we saw.   Having to drive, and walk, and open a door, and grab a tool, cut a hole, and do a surprise task, in imprecise conditions is a hard task right now. We've just scratched the surface, but it was a surface that needed scratching."

The algorithm basically all biped robots use is about always being able to shift your center of balance around over your foot.  Overall it lets you keep the center of mass more stable, which makes it much easier to walk without falling over."
robotics,39zzwl,sixwings,0,Tue Jun 16 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"Since humans do not walk like that and have no problem balancing, it's obvious that Asimo's designers anticipated that the software would be easier by having a crouching robot.

I'm not impressed. Sorry.   It keeps its legs crouched so that it can react to any push from any direction.  The robot can't feel wind on its skin, or anticipate things being thrown at it- there are a million things that could cause it to unbalance, so it is rational to be prepared.  A human walks with straight knees because they assume nothing will happen.  If you put that person in an environment with sudden, unexpected impulses, like standing on a subway, or on a skateboard, and suddenly the knees are bent, and you walk with bent knees.  Human walking makes a ton of assumptions that robots don't.  Why would humanlike walking be impressive?  There's no reason for it.  ASIMO's designers are working on other problems.   On a different tangent, when are we going to see a preponderance of bipedal robots with artificial muscles (not electric motors)   probably never.

When I change the angles on the forward kinematics, this changes the inverse kinematic dials, to output the position, roll, pitch and yaw. I can then change the position, roll, pitch and yaw dials which will change the dials for the forward kinematics for the angles that would reach that position and orientation, the only problem that I have is that I cannot get the the roll/pitch/yaw of the end effector, I hope this makes sense, I will post a video after work."

I 3d print my gears and fancy bearings. For larger pieces I can sometimes laser cut.   I've written control software in Java and the firmware is based on gcodecncdemo. Most of the robots I've built to date (like the makelangelo art robot or my arm3 paletizing arm) were practice for the arm6.  My goal is 50cm reach carrying 1kg with +/-0.5mm repeatable accuracy. I don't care about speed.  The wrist will be a camera tripod mount adapter for fast tool changing.  Torque is measured in Nm. A 1kg weight pulling down by gravity (9.8m/s/s) at 50cm needs ~5Nm just to hold still. A typical printer NEMA17 is <0.5Nm.  I spent ~$3k trying to develop a hypocycloid gearbox for NEMA17 so I could overcome this problem.  Cycloid all gears done right have no backlash, making them perfect for robotics.  You might have seen it at my booth at Bay Area Maker Faire or in a HaCkaday Fail Of The Week or when I blogged it in the HaCkaday.io contest entry.  Long story short, uneven forces are bad, mkay?  I've got new ideas to overcome the problem, so there's that.  Next try to draw a model of your arm. Study existing industrial arms and you'll discover the wrists are really a fun assembly of nested parts. On YouTube I have a playlist of 6 and 7 dof robot arms. Shockingly few dissection videos.  So that's where I'm at. I plan to release my arm as another open source robot kit on http://marginallyclever.com.

A good teacher will constantly interact with the class to keep their attention, and is there to respond to questions, both to the advantage of the person asking, and to the whole class who may gain a deeper understanding as a result. For some students with particularly good self discipline, it may make economic sense to take mostly online/computerized courses, but for others, having the actual professor there will still add considerable value.  And as the article admits, the more creativity involved in the work, the harder it will be to automate the teaching and grading.

robotics,39vwxc,philiptkd,2,Mon Jun 15 05:58:22 2015 UTC,"I saw the live action musical The Lord of the Rings in Toronto.  They had a moving floor with programmable-height tiles.  The show was fantastic, especially the destruction of the ring.  The main problem with these types of systems is twofold: safety and utility.  We like level ground.  We expect level ground.  If the floor is going to have unpredictable heights, we are going to stumble, and trip.  At best, we are always going to have to keep one eye on the floor to avoid stumbling.  At worst, we're going to crack a skull on the corner of one of those tiles, and die.  As for utility, there might be some applications in lab settings: wind tunnels, for example, could use such a system for terrain simulation.  While there is potential for stage work, it is far, far cheaper to simply use wooden platforms and wheel them in and out by hand.    In terms of VR, you have the additional problem of mapping what the in-game avatar is seeing and doing to what the gamer's physical body is seeing and doing.  For example, the avatar may be a lot taller than the player.  Do you adjust the moveable floor tiles to the in-game terrain height, or to the player's height?  What about moving on those raising and lowering platforms?  Do you want the omnidirectional treadmill action, or the variable height action?  What about slopes?  How do you slope the platform AND make it omnidirectional AND make it variable height?  LSS (Long story short):  They are unsafe, of limited use, and expensive.  They are a solution looking for a problem."

robotics,39p852,muchcharles,3,Sat Jun 13 13:33:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is structural steel is reasonably specific in how it's made. It would (probably) have a different microstructure than what you get from welding. Think a nice sword hitting a bad sword. The crystal structure is different, so the bad sword breaks."
robotics,39p852,Jak-o-Shadows,3,Sun Jun 14 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"You're right, welded steel has different strength and microstructure than bulk steel.  Usually you hear that the weld is stronger than the base metal, which is not actually true.  The weld is much smaller in volume than the base metal, so it cools quickly and into a semihardened state, while the metal around it cools more slowly and anneals slightly, so the metal right next to the weld is weaker than the weld itself.  Its possible to have a weld be stronger than structural steel, just by using a better kind of steel.    Overall though when all is said and done this bridge will be in a mostly annealed state, and a cold rolled bridge would probably be ~10% stronger, which is basically irrelevant in an application like this.  You would use engineering to make up for the 10% loss of strength.    But structural applications are the last thing this would be used for.  The number 1 motivator for structural steel is cost, and this machine will not improve that."

Most of the internet right now uses IPv4 while IPv6 is under way for wide scale deployment. Internet Protocols are determined by standards organizations consisting of the most credible and interested parties from across the world.  What DARPA funding does is it gets the ball rolling on concepts that no sane capitalist would put their money behind, because it's just too freaking risky from a cost/payoff viewpoint. No one wants to be the first to inject the money in the bleeding edge research, because everyone knows that that stage of development takes a lot of money, and it won't take long after you have a working version before your competitors can take your fundamental concepts, start innovating on them at a fraction of the cost of your initial investment, and then leave you in the dirt. This is a fundamental weakness of capitalism that DARPA and other agencies, like the NSF, exist to overcome.  Edit:   We'll never know!   There are lots of things we'll never know. That's not a justifiable argument for sitting around and waiting for something to happen on its own, especially when that ""something"" is extremely unlikely to happen, but would have tremendous benefits for humanity."
robotics,39lmdn,GreyMX,0,Sat Jun 13 00:21:17 2015 UTC,"No, there are obviously many US federal agencies that fund research without monetary concerns as the primary motive.  I think it is great that DARPA is funding robotics research. It's worth questioning how they spend the money, though. For example, suppose that instead of spending $50 million on the Robotics Challenge, they distributed $100,000 each to fund PhD studies in robotics for 500 top American graduate students coming from other fields. Would the long-term outcomes be better or worse than funding the DRC event?"

DARPA funds tons of robotics PhD students already. Easily on the scale of 500, probably more.  The point of a competition like this is to inject money in a very targeted way. The cumulative research of 500 PhD dissertations is likely to be very disconnected and abstract. A competition like the DRC generates much more targeted interest in a very specific application.  As a result of the DRC, Google's robotics division has been buying up robotics companies and roboticists associated with the DRC like hotcakes. This is the same thing that happened after the DARPA Urban Challenge and the DARPA Grand Challenge. A decade from now, the money that DARPA spent on these competitions that spurned all that interest will be a drop in the bucket compared to the increased GPD from these new markets."
robotics,39lmdn,GreyMX,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:27:42 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the Google acquisitions of SCHAFT and Boston Dynamics. Is this a good thing? If so, maybe DARPA should have just forgone the whole Challenge event and handed a $50,000,000 check to Google. That way, the shareholders of GOOG could capture all the value from the taxpayers directly.  Publically-funded STEM research in the US usually is beneficial because it produces widely-available research products shared by all (journal papers, etc.). Team SCHAFT (in Japan) received $3 million in DARPA Challenge funding, and then disappeared into Google. Is that a win for the US taxpayers?"
robotics,39lmdn,HighInterestRate,2,Sat Jun 13 00:37:25 2015 UTC,"Why should we put all our eggs in the Google basket? The winner of the semi-finals was a Japanese team, and the winner of the finals was a South Korean team. Would Google have thought to look for talent in those places if they had just been given a check without the competition beforehand? Would Google have wanted to try hiring anybody without first seeing what they were capable of? I assure you that Google is grateful for the competition, because it essentially acted like a free and highly effective recruitment tool for them.  And maybe Google wouldn't want to work with DARPA in the first place. After all, the first thing that Google did after acquiring SCHAFT and Boston Dynamics was end their contracts with DARPA as soon as possible.  And finally, as an American taxpayer, I absolutely do not want DARPA giving a ton of money to Google, a company that already has plenty of capital, just so they further increase their profit margins. I want to see DARPA giving that money to a mix of start up companies (like SCHAFT, Rainbow/KAIST, Robotis) who need that capital, and to academic/non-profit labs (like MIT, Virginia Tech, IHMC) who will be sharing their developments with the scientific community."

Would their productivity over a year produce more breakthroughs than the challenge as it is now, with a few dozen teams?  How are all these teams funded, as I understand it, they fund themselves, and only the winner gets a payout (prize?). Does doing it this way ensure that there are many corporate entrants, including the big robotics players, each spending their own money, and the prize is just prestige / incentive in case they win?

This isn't quite right. Most of the teams are self-funded, but there are eight teams who had top placement in the semi-finals, and they've been receiving funds from DARPA in order to compete. Before that, there were four different categories of teams involved in the challenge:  Track A was funded by DARPA to design and build their own robots and compete  Track B was funded by DARPA and were provided Atlases from Boston Dynamics to compete  Track C was a category during the ""Virtual Robotics Challenge"". They were unfunded but could compete through simulation. Track C teams that placed high in the Virtual Robotics Challenge were promoted to Track B for the semi-finals.  Track D was completely unfunded, and they were responsible for designing and building their own robots.   Also keep in mind that a graduate student even with 100k can only go so far in building a robot. It typically takes a team, and lots of investment in the hardware and equipment.   This is the key thing to keep in mind.

As far as making it strike, its a simple teach and repeat method, where you tell it a few points by manually positioning it and then tell it to connect them in one motion. The work done in this video seem highly rudimentary, using what looks like nothing more than encoders for feedback.  If you wanted to do something like this you would just need software that would randomly cycle through a few preprogrammed motions, fairly easy but the robot itself is going to be tens of thousands of dollars.  Its not that challenging (for a robotics engineer like myself) to incorporate a motion tracking system and have the robot attack and defend using those predefined motions, or if you want to get really fancy you can have it calculate its own trajectory to defend and attack targeting open areas, but once again it will cost a fair bit of money.  The technology is already at the point where this can be done, with the linked video being laughably simple to a robotics engineer. Its a matter of having someone with the funding to make it happen"

robotics,39czvr,Badmanwillis,2,Wed Jun 10 22:58:00 2015 UTC,My question is which way one should go if as a long term goal one wants to be able to develop robots without having to rely on parts that are available on the market. For example something like the Festo BionicANTs.   I also wonder where the limits are of the complexity of the robot one can build on his own in a reasonable time. Should one focus on one certain part of robotics like for example computer vision instead of trying to learn everything?  Can one even seriously learn robotics  beyond a hobby on his own with the parts available for consumers? What hardware and software is actually used by robotic researchers for the realization of their projects? Are there any blogs or news sites that have in-depth articles on current robotics?  Hope It's okay to post my question here. Thanks in advance for the replies!

There is no way I can do this without getting help from people in the other disciplines (ME, EE, CS) or teaching myself at least the basics of everything (what I'm doing).   The biggest problems I'm running into are lack of money, and learning everything takes so much time. For me, everything I do basically rotates on how to fix or get around those two problems. Working on the stuff in my discipline is basically a side thought at this point.  Maybe other people have better luck with this, but trying to make this stuff at a professional level where I can sell it on the market is proving to be a bitch. Getting someone else who can help with/do the things you don't know and with the funds would be something to fix that. I'm just too far along to ask now. I also am on the verge of getting this past the ""just a hobby stage."" Maybe another few months and I'll be there.  I also have probably a few thousand dollars worth of tools and a 3D printer with a good modeling program to use. That also helps quite a bit, not sure how many tools other guys have to work with."
robotics,39czvr,newplayer33554432,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:19:16 2015 UTC,"I also wonder where the limits are of the complexity of the robot one can build on his own in a reasonable time.    Probably Matt Denton's Mantis hexapod is near the limits http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sRlFQLwg3w , largest and most complex robot built by one man that I saw, has at least 18 DOF. There are also japanese humanoids and servo-driven BJD dolls with 18 or more DOF: http://dancingdoll-rz.com/main.htm DOF is a very rough measure of robot complexity though.   Can one even seriously learn robotics beyond a hobby on his own with the parts available for consumers?   Depends on your success criteria for ""learning robotics"", as it's an endless field. First, note that there is a strong distinction between mobile robots and industrial robots, the latter are a (boring) majority of robots out there: they are bolted to their workcells, they don't have any sensors except encoders in their joints, and all they do is endlessly traversing the trajectory that was programmed into them by a technician. If you want to consider programming these trajectories as your life's career you may just need any bachelor's degree in robotics/mechatronics or some training certificate.  I assume that you are interested in mobile robots working in unstructured enviroments though (as you see mobile robotics compared to industrial robotics is a much smaller field). If designing and manufacturing (and selling to consumers) a small quantity of roomba-like two-wheeled cleaning robots is considered beyond hobby level than that's entirely possible with consumer parts and some 3d printing. I totally agree that for more complex robots cheap consumer parts don't cut it anymore, even dynamixel servos (considered semi-hobby) are very expensive. Sad truth is that there isn't any consumer demand for complex robots (see discontinuing of Sony Aibo), people are much more into smartphones and apps than into real-world toys/robots these days. So if you want to do complex mobile robot that isn't a roomba or a telepresence RC car there isn't much industry or consumer market yet, so if you do work in this field it will be either hobby or research (which is similar to hobby but with some state funding and obligation to publish something in a peer reviewed journal).   Are there any blogs or news sites that have in-depth articles on current robotics?   Search for interesting papers at google scholar, maybe read a bit of ieee spectrum and hizook.com   What hardware and software is actually used by robotic researchers for the realization of their projects?   Robotics researchers tend to publish designs (more like partial descriptions of designs) of their robots, you can find them on google scholar. Examples of cool state-of-art bipeds are e.g. HRP-4C https://staff.aist.go.jp/k.kaneko/publications/2011_publications/IROS2011-0107.pdf https://staff.aist.go.jp/k.kaneko/publications/2011_publications/IROS2011-0164.pdf http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ill-Woo_Park/publication/220671078_Mechanical_design_of_the_humanoid_robot_platform_HUBO/links/5449c3b80cf2ea65413419b4.pdf Also you may look at https://svn.robotology.eu/repos/iCubHardware-pub/trunk/mechanics/ , but I wouldn't consider this design as 100% professional as iCub still cannot walk (I wonder if authors didn't do high-school force/torque math for leg servos or they just didn't care if it walks or not while they can publish papers). Also there are interesting Aldebaran Nao mechanical part descriptions: http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/family/nao_h25/motors_h25.html and a paper http://lars.mec.ua.pt/public/LAR%20Projects/Humanoid/2011_RicardoGodinho/Pesquisa%20Disserta%C3%A7%C3%A3o/Mechatronic%20design%20of%20NAO%20humanoid.pdf  If you look at these designs you will see that most of parts are standard harmonic reducers, servos and gears with minimal customization. These are industrial-grade, not hobby-grade parts though, and these servos can easily cost 3k$ each (because that's not a problem for industrial robots that are sold for 100000$+, where these parts are primarily used, and also not a problem for state-funded robotics researchers). There are exceptions though, e.g. Aldebaran Nao uses in-house designed composite plastic gears because it's cheaper (Aldebaran isn't funded by the state like researchers, so it has incentives to lower the cost of a single unit) also probably some japanese researchers can afford to do custom parts for their robots. So, most robotics researchers don't build their actuators and just use industrial-grade servos/reducers, embedding them into machined robot frames of their own design.  Regarding software there isn't any special software in 99% of research robots, researchers try to reuse as much opensource code as possible. The software is usually either a mess of opensource vision/pointcloud/motionplanning/inversekinematics/ZMP libs (search google for these words) hacked by students that kind of controls the robot right 95% of the time, or it is a full bloated ROS install with plugins for everything. Anyway state of art robotics software requires lot of hand tweaking to control a robot in some limited set of unstructured enviroments. When robotics experiment is done and a paper published software is usually discarded and forgotten.  Considering your main question:   My question is which way one should go if as a long term goal one wants to be able to develop robots without having to rely on parts that are available on the market.   Should designing robots with novel actuators be considered a goal in itself, or should you instead focus on designing robots that solve human problems? It's impossible to do both at the same time. Try to get into hobby robotics first, it's entirely possible to build mobile robot with simple vision system at home (I did this, ask if you want or see my previous posts, I already posted a description of wifi webcam robot build), you will have an overview of robotics and so it will be easier to choose where to focus later. Then you'll see how it goes and what degree you need, if you need it.  Also note that my advice can be biased as I am a programmer and robotics is just my hobby (I considered industrial robotics too boring and consumer robotics too risky/nonexistent to make any of them my main career).  Feel free to ask questions if you want to get into hobby robotics or physical simulation of robots."

I had the same doubt and ended up researching a lot of things both from the software and hardware standpoint. The fact of the matter is, there is no go-to resource to start learning about robotics but there are some close ones.  I guess depending on your software and hardware proficiency, you can choose between different levels of arduino programming to start. Arduino is a great platform to begin with and to learn about different aspects of robotics. The next step in the process is to jump to Linux robotics, which (unfortunately) in my opinion, has a HUGE learning curve. If you can get past that, ROS will be a huge resource with a big community.  Unfortunately, I don't have straight answer for a hardware platform that you can use for more complicated tasks using ROS. I guess the first (cheapest) platform out there is the turtlebot.  It was this exact reason why I started a project with a friend of mine to build an easy to use robotics platform that uses ROS. We are currently releasing the alpha version for the same.

robotics,39coxb,Zaflis,3,Wed Jun 10 21:45:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe you mean actuator technology. Let's compare human and humanoid robot locomotion: Human weighting 60 kg walking at 1.25 m/s uses ~67 watts of mechanical power and  ~180 watts of metabolic power (see [1] for numbers).  Average electroservo-driven biped (e.g. [2]) has 300 watt-rated servodrive just in one knee (there are 5 other less powerful drives in a robot leg so total power per leg is about 1000w), and newer ones (SCHAFT, DRC-HUBO) use active cooling to have >1000w peak power [3]. It's hard to find measurements of power consumption when walking, but it wouldn't be an overestimate to say that it's 1000w continuous.  So, robots use 3-5 times as much power as humans to walk. Why? There is no one easy answer, but we know that robots most often use ZMP algorithm for walking, and it's a static gait, it just moves robot center of mass inside it's support polygon. Dynamic effects such as leg swing momentum are not used, actually servo uses power to neutralize these effects. Also servos are very often rigidly coupled to robot support structure, this design leads to further inefficiency (human muscles have elastic coupling to bones that helps store and release energy when walking). There are research projects [4],[5] to bring dynamic efficient walking to robotics, but they haven't succeeded yet, probably because dynamic walking problem has much more mathematical complexity and is harder to control than simple ZMP. Mainstream biped gait control approach remains ZMP+small amounts of dynamic control. Probably every DRC team used that combination.  Maybe it's time to stop clinging to handcrafted control systems (like we did with feature engineering in computer vision) and solve this hard dynamic control problem with machine learning (deep learning?). It could work, it could not. We will see.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3223624/ http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~antonio.dangelo/Robotica/2012/helper/10.1.1.153.4069.pdf http://www.tuat.ac.jp/~venture/ronbun/ReadingGroupControl/2010_Design_for_high_speed_and_torque_leg_with_coolant.pdf http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shc17/Collins_2005_ICRA.pdf http://www.ihmc.us/groups/sea/"

Perhaps the main reasons that most robots are slow is that fast=expensive and fast=dangerous. Especially the second point is important; a fast human-sized robot can easily kill somebody in an accident. You would need a safety cage, special procedures and checklists to work with, and a safety observer hovering over an emergency shutdown whenever it is powered up. That's slow and cumbersome to work with, and the risk of accidents is high.  If you research doesn't need the speed and strength you're better off without it."

robotics,399yf3,SystemicPlural,22,Wed Jun 10 08:58:44 2015 UTC,"When humans walk, they are basically always off balance. It's not so much about ""uncontrolled"" movement, it's that you have to allow yourself to be uncontrolled, if you like. That's why we trip over a lot. So to do the same for a robot, you have to basically put it in a state, every step, where it is falling over, and then ""trust"" that the foot will be in the right place to catch it. And then when you add rubble underfoot, well, that all goes to hell, because suddenly the foot isn't in the right place...  As processing gets smaller and more powerful, they will improve, but you as a human are basically crunching a whole lot of numbers to do a whole lot of really complex kinematics and dynamics problems by instinct, and if you don't get them right, you trip. You've had years to practice - but more to the point, years to offload ""processing"" to ""distributed non-cognitive systems"" (aka reflexes). Robots still have to do it the hard way - literally crunching the numbers at every millisecond.  We also know, again largely by instinct, how to move our feet and legs. For a robot, it's complicated by either ""too few options"" or ""too many options"". Constrain the joint, and you have much less math to do, but much less versatility in foot placement. Allow the joint freedom, and you have more math, and even more instability."

It is not exactly settled how it is that humans and animals move, and there will likely be progress in that area, parallel to progress in computational techniques, machine learning and mechanical solutions, that will hopefully one day culminate in robust walking robots.   Motor control theories could be roughly divided in two main paradigms: a) computation-heavy, internal models, prediction, modern control theory; and b) equilibrium points, embodied computation, less emphasis on control theory.  The strength of approach a) is that they can actually make moving robots bases on their theories, but as proponents of approach b) claim - these systems are likely not biologically plausible, i.e. brains are not capable of calculating all the required variables to maintain required internal models and predictions. On the other hand, approach b) didn't produce working, moving robots yet.  (source: I did my masters on arm control)"

It will really be better when graphene hits mass market as when it is in a composite with polyurethane foam and immersed in an ionic liquid, it makes a very capable and inexpensive electricity only actuator capable of Proportional control and contraction feedback without encoders and such.

You start printing the silicone expansion bladder, and when the void forms, start printing directly the PU/graphene composite.  Leave some holes in the silicone exposing the composite. Put in ionic solution and let set to disolve the PLA in the composite. This will make the muscle expand to its full size.  Drain the ionic fluid and connect the electrodes in two ports at either end of the muscle (flexible conductive glues based of of Silver or Graphene should do the job).  Plug holes used for ionic fluid release.  The liquid still in the composite should be enough.   Boom, (mostly) 3d printed actuator. Add some fittings for connecting it to the machine's frame and connect it to the bot's electrical system.    These EAPS also can generate electricity from movement, so in theory you could also make sensors with them or even make a type of free piston ICE as a generator.  (All conjecture from reading research papers and hearing the buzz in 3d printing currently.  Beats the hell out of electric motors)"

Too much compliance and you can't accurately control force output, to little and the robot is rigid and ""bounces"" off the ground when it steps."

You know how you have an impressive brain that's able to process information, understand it and apply to your own body and environment.   That held water twenty years ago, but I really dont think it applies to this problem.  Walking is complicated sure, but its definitely not that computationally intensive.   You know how you have a vast complex sensory system. That you can sense you balance, detect contact with your skin and take in the world through your amazing eyes. You know how you can do this all at the same time instantaneously.   Gyroscopes are way more sensitive than human ears.  Lets take eyes out of the equation, since robots tend to work on perfectly flat floors and yet still have a ton of difficulty with this.  They are loaded with force and position sensors, but still 90% of the top robots can't walk dynamically like a person.    You how we put this amazing system to work on the problem of walking and it still takes about a year for us to do and even a few more to do it well.   meh.  It would take me decades to develop the skills to become an accurate painter, but a robot could be programmed to copy images trivially.   Robots have none of these things. They can't learn like we can, they can't sense like we can and they don't have the ability to balance like we can. It is hard for a robot to walk on two legs because walking on two legs is hard.   The problem itself isn't hard, we can simulate it easy.  Its something about the details, or the implementation, or the motivation.  Personally I think its because there is never been a compelling enough reason to risk the robot falling and smashing its face.  Robots are slow because people expect them to be slow.  Take Hubo.  It won first place in the trials, but doesn't even walk up stairs right.  Its just because its convenient.  Walking fluidly is a low-priority task, with little reward and lots of risk.    If you tell a team specifically to make something that moves like a human, you get PETMAN, but suddenly when there are other goals, ATLAS goes back to walking like he does in the DRC.  Petman doesn't exactly walk fluidly either, but its good enough for my point."

robotics,399yf3,Don_Patrick,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"First off, walking is a very complex harmony of dozens if not hundreds of muscles all acting in concert.  It's also a learned reflex, even our bodies take months to learn to do it at all and years to get really good at it.  We also have a great many sensors, including balance, touch, and importantly proprioception, which are all integral and important to the act of walking.  Robots are trying to walk with very little sensory input.  Probably nothing more than accelerometers and gyros, plus probably servos, which you can TELL where you WANT them to go, but don't necessarily give you feedback. Some advanced systems probably give feedback as well.  Even if they're using a sense of touch, it's probably very primative, contact based rather than pressure based, so they can't use it as an additional input to tell if they're out of balance."

robotics,396qgc,machine2010,2,Wed Jun 10 03:17:15 2015 UTC,"There are several advantages to bipedal robots.  1) Bipedal walking is a version of dynamic stability.  Human walking is basically a series of falling.  You can't stop midstride.  This is opposed to statically stable walking, which requires 4 or more legs.  Dynamic stability is much more energy efficient.   Of course, this comes at a cost of complexity in hardware and control  2) Bipedal walking is much more robust (when it works) to terrain.  It is easier to walk over rubble, step over curbs, etc...  Designing wheeled systems to do this is much more difficult.  It also lets you use things like ladders and the terrain itself to go up very step surfaces.  3) As humans, we have designed our environment to work well for our form factor, which happens to be bipedal. Thus a bipedal humanoid robot would be the one most suited to operate in human environment and use human equipment."

So basically I have 12 dials in the software, 6 inverse, 6 forward, with each joint angle for the forwards, and x,y,z, roll, pitch, yaw for the inverse, when I move the forward kinematic dials, the x,y,z, roll, pitch, yaw will change to match it and vice-versa"

robotics,3949in,dont-be-silly,5,Tue Jun 9 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts on your three questions:   Yes, the robots in the DARPA Challenge were remotely operated by their teams. However, the rules called for specific communication bandwidth limitations, so fine-grained tele-operation would be difficult, and semi-autonomous behavior was encouraged. There was 300 Mbit/sec bandwidth allowed from the robot to the operator (this was reduced sharply during a portion of the 4 indoor tasks), and a 9600 bit/sec link from the operator to the robot. So, the operators could see a video stream and 3D LIDAR data from the robot's sensors, but they sent only high-level commands back to the semi-autonomous robots (such as the general location of where to take their next step, or where the valve was located). I don't know why so many teams used a biped approach. Note that 4 of the top 5 finishers in the contest used primarily locomotion approaches with four points of contact on the ground, although the KAIST robot could switch from 4-wheeled to biped walking motion to go up the stairs. CHIMP did stand up successfully after falling on Friday. I think the term you're looking for is ""autonomous robot"". Search for ""autonomous robot challenge"" on Google, and you'll find things like the International Autonomous Robot Racing Challenge (IARRC), RobotChallenge, RoboCup, etc."

robotics,3949in,gothungry,5,Tue Jun 9 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"I've been hearing these questions a lot -- let me do my best:  Ultimately, these DARPA challenges are designed to spur research and innovation in some incredibly difficult engineering topics which can have great use in the future. In 2004 and 2007, they did this by kick-starting autonomous cars (DARPA Grand Challenge, DARPA Urban Challenge). The goal of the DRC was NOT ""disaster relief"" as much as ""humanoid robotics.""   In robotics, you frequently hear about ""levels of autonomy."" A fully autonomous system requires no input whatsoever from the operator during runtime, where as a semi-autonomous system has both autonomous and tele-operated behaviors. In this competition, the DRC organizers did not require the tasks to be fully autonomous because they thought it would be difficult enough to have a humanoid walk around semi-autonomously (justifiably so).   To answer your questions more specifically:   Specialized inputs could have been used if the team thought it would be the best way to control the robot... I think it was easier to programmatically control the robot for this competition. I know there was a team using an Oculus Rift to visualize data.  Bipeds aren't necessarily the best design for disaster relief. Personally, I think CMU's Chimp and JPL's RoboSimian are excellent designs for disaster relief.  There are many smaller-scale competitions in robotics such as RoboSub, MicroTransat or even the Amazon Picking challenge... all with varying levels of autonomy. The DARPA challenges however are usually the biggest ones that essentially define the forefront of technology and draws the most amount of research and interest among academics.    Hope that helped!"

robotics,3949in,pm_me_your_rockets,4,Tue Jun 9 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"I was on a team in the DRC up through the semi-finals, and I've been following it somewhat closely since then, so I can answer your questions pretty comprehensively. Let me know if you want me to elaborate on anything.   why are the not controlled directly with input-gloves or by a more direct way ?   The DRC is meant to emulate a small subset of some of the more difficult aspects of a real-world disaster scenario. One big aspect is unreliable communication with the robot. Consider a nuclear facility that is experiencing a meltdown: Nuclear plants are going to have many walls that are thick with concrete and metal, and all the infrastructure that would normally be at your disposal is compromised by the physical hazards of the meltdown environment. It is unlikely that you will be able to maintain a high fidelity connection to your robot for useful lengths of time. Therefore, the DRC imposed some artificial limitations on the fidelity of the competitor's connections to their robots, forcing the competitors to push as much autonomy into the robots as possible.   So why not a specialized input that requires a pilot in the first place, similar with flying drones?   The inputs that were being used were very specialized, but the goal of the inputs' design was to allow the human operator to issue the most efficient commands possible that required the least amount of fidelity in their communication. Ideally, it should be a high level command that the robot can use to generate a plan on its own.   Why are biped's favored ?   The basic idea behind favoring a biped is that the robots are going to be sent into structures built for humans to navigate, and those structures will have things like stairs and ladders. Clearly the winning robot design was to have the best of both the biped world and the wheeled world, because that's exactly what KAIST did. They used legs to drive the car and climb the stairs, then wheels for everything else.   Is there also a similar challenge for robot AI ?   I haven't participated in RoboCup, but I think at least a few of those leagues are fully autonomous. I think the FIRST Robotics Competition is also fully autonomous, but again I've never been involved with it."

Unfortunately ""back in the day"" predated my awareness of microprocessors, microcontrollers, stepper motors, servos, digital electronics, and a whole bunch of other tech.  I built arms and hands with direct lever control, or sometimes string and rubber band devices.  I only had one motor, and I was forever running out of batteries.

Edit: for the record vex is probably the ideal for what you are looking for but I already typed this out so...
robotics,393bmg,Creagar,3,Tue Jun 9 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"I'm in pretty much the same boat as you.  My first go at it was to get motors wheels, tracks, and a drive controller from Pololu.  I like their stuff.. Then I made my own chassis from hardboard and c channel aluminum from home depot. I used a mitre box and drill press thing from Dremel to drill holes..  Thing is, you can't get the same tolerances from hommade stuff (at least not with my setup) that you need.  I since started using tamiya plates, which at least give a uniform hole spacing, but still, not so good. When you start making a robot, if one wheel alignment is off by even 1 degree, then your software will never behave as expected.  Sparkfun now offers a product called redbot which is a kit but it's $85. For $99 Pololu has a really good 32U4 robot kit that has everything you need to do really advanced robot stuff like balancing and line following.  It really depends on where your interests lie.  If you just want a solid platform that does lots of stuff and you are more focused on tweaking software, you can't beat the Pololu platform.  If you're like me and you get into the architecture and manufacturing of the chassis etc., then you won't be happy until you can make your own quality 3D printed parts.  The Tamiya plates helped me and I ended up bending them with heat to make my own chassis, but it's still imprecise.  I've been saving up and plan to buy a duplicator i3 3d printer from wanhao usa.  I've heard it said before that if your robot is physically well made, you can work on the code to get the performance you are seeking, but a poorly made robot will always be a sub-par piece of bantha fodder.

Some of the teams have dumped many millions of dollars into the development programs to create their robots. DARPA gave approximately $4 million each to several of the teams (the ""Track A"" funded teams) to develop their robots, and other teams received lesser amounts. The DARPA contract to Boston Dynamics to produce the 7 Atlas robots used in the contest was $11+ million. Following the competition, a reporter asked the winning KAIST team lead how much their robot prototype would eventually sell for, and he estimated $500,000-$1,000,000.  Overall, the DARPA Robotics Challenge cost American taxpayers several tens of millions of dollars. Do you think it was money well spent?"

If you were underwhelmed, then I can only imagine that you set literally impossible standards for what you were expecting from the competition. The top teams at the DRC finals consisted mostly of the world's leading experts in bleeding edge robotics, so it's not as if the money could have been offered to better candidates."

The mechanism that makes it possible is through slip rings, carbon brushes that conduct electricity, and springs that push the brushes to touch the slip rings; hench, the term ""brushed motor.""  It's DIYable. Just get $2 motor brushes off eBay and slip rings could be a strip of aluminum, or better yet use the copper tape. Anyway, there are off-the-shelf slip rings available everywhere. Search term is ""robot slip ring"" if you just want fast solution. This mechanism may have issues with high frequency signals, because it generates electrical noises in themselves. If that is the case, you can use radio or light-based communication just for signals.  If you just want 360-deg rotation for 1 to 1.5 revolution, you may as well use twist capsules. It doesn't use the carbon brushes, work more reliably and will last much longer. There's no sliding contact like with slip ring and brush. In industrial applications, twist capsules are preferred over slip rings and brushes. NASA uses twist capsules for a number of its space robots."

They are severely limited in power, wear out, get dusty, etc etc.  They are tricky.  I personally like rotary transformers, which can operate at basically unlimited rpms, in any environment (unlike slip rings, which can spark flammable gases and give off dust etc.), at very low noise levels.    Alternatively you could use a cheap wireless solution, like wifi, which could maybe get you a Gbit or two connection.  Those ESPs are <$20.  Also you could rig up something with LEDs for communication, but I couldn't find a commercial product for that."
robotics,38z4vu,ThatInternetGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"Rotary transformer:       A rotary (rotatory) transformer is a specialized transformer used to couple electrical signals between two parts that rotate in relation to each other. They may be either cylindrical or 'pancake' shaped.  Slip rings can be used for the same purpose, but are subject to friction, wear, intermittent contact, and limitations on the rotational speed that can be accommodated without damage. Wear can be eliminated by using a pool of liquid mercury instead of a solid ring contact, but the toxicity and slow corrosion of mercury are problematic, and very high rotational speeds are again difficult to achieve. A rotary transformer has none of these limitations.  Rotary transformers are constructed by winding the primary and secondary windings into separate halves of a cup core; these concentric halves face each other, with each half mounted to one of the rotating parts. Magnetic flux provides the coupling from one half of the cup core to the other across an air gap, providing the mutual inductance that couples energy from the transformer's primary to its secondary.

I think the big advantage of Arduino is that it's not a toy, skills you learn with it could be directly applied to teenage classes on electronics (in the UK this used to be Technology: Systems & Control) as well as prototyping products for startup businesses.  The kit starts out with some simple electronic circuits on a breadboard and then moves on to fancier stuff with some simple programming. You also need a laptop or something to connect the kit to a USB port and write/upload the simple programs on. Plus if you break part of the kit replacement bits are pretty cheap and easily available.  Rasberry Pi does something similar but I've personally only tried the  Arduino kit."

Honestly, it's kind of awkward trying to jump into hobby robotics without first getting into hobby electronics and maker stuff.  What you're gonna need is a toolchain to make things. Multimeter, soldering iron, Dremel, etc. You should find a maker community, get access to fancier tools, like oscilloscope, laser cutter, 3D printers...  Learning electronics is a must. Not everything is plug'n'play, you need to learn how to interface your sensors, how to power your devices, etc. Mechanics is kind of optional. If you're gonna 3D print, you should learn to use a design program like SolidWorks or something. The practical side of mechanics, you can't really learn it from books or the net, you mostly pick it up on the go when you get into a workshop. Analytical mechanics is very math heavy, and only necessary for robots like a hexapod or a 6DoF arm.  Generally, you should have a specific project / robot to work on, but don't be too greedy with its complexity. Get a toy car, put an arduino on top and try to control it from bluetooth. Gradually work your way up to cooler projects like drones and hexapods or robot arms..."

robotics,38v0vo,skhul,6,Sun Jun 7 01:46:02 2015 UTC,"Each team has a group of sequestered human operators controlling the robot from a remote location away from the course. The teams vary in the amount of autonomy that they utilize.  A higher degree of autonomy is encouraged by the Challenge rules due to the limited communication bandwidth between the operators and the robots. During the 4 outdoor tasks (driving, vehicle egress, door opening, and stair-climbing), the bandwidth is a generous 300 Mbit/sec from the robot to the operator, and 9600 bit/sec from operator to robot. During the 4 indoor tasks, the bandwidth from robot to operator is significantly reduced below 300 Mbit/sec, due to frequent ""blackout periods"" lasting up to 30 seconds each. The length of these blackout periods is gradually decreased during the course of the hour-long run, so that during the final minutes, the teams can get 300 Mbit/sec bandwidth again even indoors.  At 300 Mbit/sec, there is plenty of bandwidth to send high quality images and other sensor data from the robot to the operators. They can then click on a visual interface to direct the robot generally where to go (with a 9600 bit/sec command stream). Given this ability for human control, the performance of most of the robots in the Challenge was disappointing to me."
robotics,38v0vo,HighInterestRate,6,Sun Jun 7 03:52:29 2015 UTC,"Wow im shocked, I thought they were totally autonomous, sounds like they are almost telepresenced which is really disappointing as you said given the performances, the money spent and the number of people and time involved.  Looks like it will be a long time before robots are a thing the way science fiction wants them to be in fact during a discussion at a recent robotics meetup it was pointed out how many of us from the first world are divorced from the reality of just how cheap, skillful and plentiful real humans are. Just look at what humans in various parts of the world will do for $5 on sites like fiverr and with the population explosion that's only going to become more plentiful. If the robotic AI is so difficult they may as well telepresence a guy in Pakistan for $5 to control the things with finesse."
robotics,38v0vo,ramblebot,2,Sun Jun 7 09:36:06 2015 UTC,"Remember that most of the robots took just 2-3 years to build and code from scratch. I was at the competition & expo and asked a number of the companies with bi-pedal robots how their machines uniquely operate. I am going in to Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in robotics, so this stuff really interests me.   There are two big hurdles that I saw needs to be overcome in the next 5-10 years, one of those hurdles will probably be done in 5.   Hurdle #1: is that the software coordination is very very rigid right now. There is no smooth way to get a robot to see what it's doing, launch what it's going to do, and confirm with its safety precautions what it is going to do (because it doesn't want to fall over) in less than 5-10 minutes. This is using 3 i7 GHz quadcore processors (one for sensing, one for controls, and one for back checking/information relay) all simultaneously and talking to one another.   What I think the issue here is, is a combination of premature software architecture development, and hardware and space limitations (remember, they have to fit these 3 mini computers in a cage being the size of the robots chest, and also have room for cooling).  Hurdle #2: This is a big one that I really don't see a solution to in the immediate future, and that is mechanical dexterity. A big issue almost every robot had (except for NASA's 4 legged spider robot) was when they reached the challenged to turn the valve or drill a hole through the wall, most robots had to actually move to the side of the wall/valve to allow their arms freedom of motion to go move their arms in a circular motion. A lot of bi-pedal robots' arms would not be able to move it's arms over its chest to reach around like human would. This either requires a simultaneous control to rotate the waist while sawing the hole in the wall, or some kind of muscular flexibility the robots really currently lack.  Let me know if you have any other questions about the competition, or the technology they are currently using in the robots."
robotics,38v0vo,trooper5010,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:37:10 2015 UTC,And why is telepresence a bad thing? I believe these robots are meant to be used in a first responder capability.

robotics,38v0vo,wensul,0,Sun Jun 7 15:26:13 2015 UTC,"No quite the opposite, I am telepresences biggest fan, ive been doing it daily with my kids who live overseas for several years now and sell them here I also pitch telepresence at robotics conferences. I think it absolutely is the way to go, perhaps augmented by some minor automated motion control in the user interface area.  Saying that, the definition of robot is ""a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by a computer."" emphasis on automatically. Telepresence falls more into glorified remote control car and in a global worlds best robot competition with millions of dollars on the line it seems disingenuous to confuse it with remote control. I  guarantee you the average Joe public believes these are automatic robots doing their thing on a track.  Not trying to be argumentative but I also don't believe in general first responder application for robotics except perhaps in extremely narrow circumstances (radiation leak maybe) outside of that I just cant see it. Speaking to some people in the first responder industry they all say its the very last place you will see robotics not just because of the lack of ability but even more so because of the liability, simple put no company wants to get lawsuited into oblivion and anyone whos watched American TV has seen endless class action lawsuit ads aimed squarely at the medical world. Another major reason is that real first responders EMT's/paramedics/volunteers are incredibly cheap.. barely minimum wage, far cheaper than any robot and there are lines of young humans who want to do it just for the excitement, almost for free. Making it easy for them to do it with telepresence in some capacity might be the way to go but its not an automatic/robot thing. Perhaps where we are disconnecting is the semantics, what problem are you referring to? what job? what do you mean by first response, to what?  The definition implies medical human in trouble situation but that seems very much a job for another trained human. Sure in the future we will have better androids but we will also have billions more humans. An example is a ship breaking yard in Bangladesh has 50 guys with a rope dragging giant metal parts of ships and a reporter asked why they didn't use a tractor where the foreman explained they were cheaper than the diesel a tractor would use, they pay the guys in rice and bananas. Don't write off humans just yet :) fiverr could equal first response, it just needs a connection."

Nonetheless, I share your disappointment with what we saw at the DARPA Finals, especially considering the low level of autonomy of the robots.  I'm still optimistic about progress in robotics, though. Remember that we didn't see the ""best of the best"" in this contest. The team that dominated the preliminary trials back in 2013, Team SCHAFT, quit the competition after being acquired by Google. Many of the leading companies and top academics in robotics don't participate in the Challenge. If you're an American taxpayer, you should be questioning if this DARPA event was an effective use of many millions of dollars."

MIT, CMU, U Tokyo, IHMC are definitely some of the leaders in the field. What companies could even compete?   There's certainly lots of academics without access to the funding necessary to compete, but you're still looking at the most advanced walking+manipulating robots that exist."
robotics,38v0vo,NiftyManiac,3,Sun Jun 7 21:09:43 2015 UTC,"The level of autonomy is selected by the teams. To encourage autonomy, DARPA imposes blackout periods of up to 30 seconds at a time, and otherwise limits the connection. In many cases teams simply choose to wait until communication is restored, so you see robots just pausing for a while. Obviously if they can operate through the blackout, they're able to gain time.  When comms are up, it's still often advantageous to have autonomous behaviors; for instance, on the valve task the operators might show the robot the location of the valve and have it figure out how to grasp it on it's own to save time. All the higher-level decisions are made by operators, though."

If we really cared about the speed increase from people carrying loads a little bit faster for a little bit longer, people would rappel down stairs instead of walking.  An exoskeleton may allow a worker to carry an engine block by hand, and recharge over his lunch break... but so does a $50 cart.

robotics,38nmto,samuraisword,20,Fri Jun 5 11:29:09 2015 UTC,I think this more of an art form than weaponizing the robot. There was a certain elegance to it that I loved
robotics,38nmto,avenger1011000,4,Fri Jun 5 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know, the psychological effect of seeing 100+ blue, 1 armed, sword wielding robots chasing me would be terrifying."
robotics,38nmto,Ididntknowwehadaking,3,Fri Jun 5 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Granted, if they grew legs/wheels I'd be the first person to start running"
robotics,38nmto,avenger1011000,12,Fri Jun 5 23:36:05 2015 UTC,"I still think the human in this case is far superior than the robot when it comes to reaction time to dynamic environments, but of course the robot is superior in terms of sheer repetitive movements."
robotics,38nmto,singapuracat,10,Fri Jun 5 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"Obviously. The robot wins in endurance, power, and probably speed.  But it doesnt have even basic targeting. Its just copying his sword movements and then they are adjusting the height and direction.   Would have been much more interesting if the robot had cameras and could choose its target and select a relevant swing. Actually, that wouldnt have been that hard to do. It was just beyond the scope of this commercial (which is what this is)."
robotics,38nmto,ataraxic89,3,Fri Jun 5 15:47:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm fairly certain that the robot wasn't operating at full speed. We don't have that brand, but my job has several fanuc, kuka, and an abb robot in our warehouse, and they can move quite a bit faster when you want them to."
robotics,38nmto,GettingFreki,2,Fri Jun 5 22:49:49 2015 UTC,"It definitely wasn't operating at full speed, otherwise we'd have only seen a blur."
robotics,38nmto,elevul,2,Sat Jun 6 00:40:49 2015 UTC,"It was supposed to match the movements, so it's speed should only match the human's speed every time."
robotics,38nmto,JupeJupeSound,3,Sat Jun 6 01:45:20 2015 UTC,Then what's the point of the 1000 cut test? Anyone who's encountered industrial robots should know that they can do the same thing thousands upon thousands of time. Endurance isn't an issue for a robot on such a short time frame. It can match the movement while still moving faster.
robotics,38nmto,GettingFreki,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"What's the point?  Well, first off this is not a robot versus sword master video.  The point is not a competition, and this isn't really a robot.  It's an industrial multipurpose manipulator connected to a motion camera.  This video is an ad for their products, not a showcase of an actual fencing robot versus a fencer.  The problem I am perceiving here, in my personal opinion, is that the submission title skews the content.  This isn't a 'competition' between man and machine.  It's a fucking advertisement for their corporation.  I'm sure many of the 30,000 people here could write control logic for a multipurpose manipulator that copies data from a motion camera.  It's not like there is an actual robot in the video that has to decipher the human and attempt to copy it.  They could have put anyone in that motion tracking jumpsuit, the 'sword master' is for propaganda purposes. The multipurpose manipulator could have been any robotic arm."

robotics,38nmto,JupeJupeSound,5,Sat Jun 6 01:44:47 2015 UTC,"Here's some ideas to ponder. That person seems to be about 30 years old. They have probably spent years perfecting their technique. The robot learnt in seconds just by observing.  That person will grow old and die, and all that training will die with them. But the robot's memory can be copied and transferred perfectly.  That person's senses and body are as good as they'll ever be, some human beings have better physical characteristics, and while we haven't reached the limits yet (the consistent breaking of athletic records shows this), there IS a limit, and we're only getting closer to it. But machines are getting stronger, lighter, quicker and more precise every year, and in the same way that this robot could cut the bean lengthwise after careful configuration, a quick enough computer and precise enough sensor could produce that configuration in milliseconds."

I'd just like to point out that Hayashi is pretty damn fast.
robotics,38nmto,Meathe,2,Fri Jun 5 20:26:40 2015 UTC,"Technically the robot learned nothing.  It is running a program that follows trajectory movements with an algorithm.  It's not like it analyzed the movement and tried to replicate it, that is not how the control logic works. Trust me on that."
robotics,38nmto,JupeJupeSound,2,Sat Jun 6 01:44:05 2015 UTC,"That is indeed not how control theory works, but that's mostly because it's not the most efficient way to get a robot to perform a task. (To be fair, using expert knowledge to program a robot isn't that common either.)     However, within the field of machine learning, there is an effort to feed algorithms expert knowledge to help bootstrap the process. This paper, for example, is an explicit attempt to do such a thing (in the field of visual classification)."

robotics,38ojwu,trooper5010,2,Fri Jun 5 21:00:04 2015 UTC,Hey TREC!  Could you divulge more for us? What kind of software glitches were you having with your robot during the competition? In retrospect what do you think would help minimize these software glitches in the future? (There's no bad answer here :) )
robotics,38ojwu,trecvt,3,Mon Jun 8 00:39:41 2015 UTC,"On our first run we had an issue where we couldn't send commands to the robot.  We had o use specific IP addresses for the Network routers and the robot was looking for the router from the course we had run on Thursday's practice.  This resulted in us taking an immediate reset while we figured things out.  Because of the network glitches not all our ROS nodes loaded, which meant not all of our tool for footstep planning were functional.  When we got to the barrier the footstep planner saw it as extending across the whole course and refused to move forward, so we reset a second time.  We'd been having intermittent issues with our right hip pitch motor controller and sadly it cropped up on our third attempt 25% of the way down the course.  The motor gave out and the robot fell.  What's cool though is you can see the motion system trying to recover the whole way down.  Damage wasn't too bad but while inspecting the robot we discovered our knee actuators were reaching their range of motion and damaging themselves, so we had to replace them overnight.  Our poor mechanical team didn't sleep.  The good news was we found the loose white which killed our hip pitch and fixed it!  Day 2 ESCHER ran like a champ taking off and completing the walk in 23 minutes, the first robot to do so.  Sadly our right wrist position was out of alignment from what the software expected resulting in having to resort to teleoperating the door.  We weren't able to get it and got zero points.  Still we're incredibly happy with our performance, we ran so early almost no one saw us but we did is a huge feat.  We think that may be the longest a biped has ever walked outdoors on regular terrain.  We got many compliments on how good our walk.  All in all not bad for a student designed and built robot with only 1.5 months to practice.  Look for more great thing from us this summer as we keep shaking ESCHER out and putting him through his paces."

robotics,38ojwu,BotJunkie,2,Fri Jun 5 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"HKU fell over sideways on its first step (they passed on the driving task today), reset, and then made it maybe 20 meters before faceplanting.  IHMC ended up with 7 points, including a lovely egress, but they fell a couple times. Robot seems okay, though.  Edit: 7 points, not 6.

robotics,38ojwu,Romesc,2,Fri Jun 5 22:22:38 2015 UTC,I chatted up one of the team members earlier today and he mentioned they are now partnering with ihmc for software. The original issue was that they had way too many super talented mechE's on the project and funneled most of the resources into a beautifully machined fully compliant fully electric motor drive wonder. The mechatronics are for sure top notch. It was just a lack of funding/allocated resources for software engineers on the team that allowed them to fall behind. We will see great things from Valkyrie in the future.

robotics,38c2hc,LeskoIam,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:42:16 2015 UTC,"An interesting article about how to make a simple electromagnet was just posted today, here. They're cool, but I'm guessing that you wouldn't get anywhere near the strength and ease of use of a servo and hinge."
robotics,38c2hc,kjmagnetics,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:19:40 2015 UTC,"I was wondering the same sort of thing since watching that movie Big Hero 6 with my kids, in it one of the toy fighting robots uses ""magnetic servos"" around the limb joints so it cant be broken and I thought at the time like in the movie there would be a lot of durability benefits to using magnetic connections instead of gears. One of the many down sides would be collecting a lot of metallic gunk as it moved around. Im guessing the primary problem though is needing too much power and of course the clunkiness of movement."
robotics,389hc8,spectrumaniac,0,Tue Jun 2 19:38:32 2015 UTC,Good lord. I didn't see anything but a limp dildo that got hard when he pulled on the syringe. Don't these guys sit back and really look at what they're building?
robotics,389fu7,jonfla,2,Tue Jun 2 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"As a roboticist, that title makes me cringe. As someone who is always under the gun to increase cycle time by endlessly optimizing the code, I see this video as a great success. The prototype works. Increasing cycle time is now a purely computer science problem which has had a few decades of research already behind it."
robotics,387788,deiv04,4,Tue Jun 2 10:02:19 2015 UTC,"hello,  Im working for Aldebaran (makers of Pepper), so I feel pretty confortable answering you :) At the moment, the only way to learn how to develop for Pepper is to buy one (so as to have access to developer resources) or to start working with the resources available for our other robot NAO (you can download our software to create app, Choregraphe, on our community website with a 90 days trial and have access to the complete documentation.)  That being said, the situation could change in the weeks/months to come, opening access to Pepper resources to a wider audience.  I hope this help!  @wtfirl"
robotics,387788,wtf_irl,2,Tue Jun 2 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone from Aldebaran replied. Btw I already have bought Pepper. But I haven't got my hands on it yet since it's still going to be shipped to Japan then to the Philippines (Manila to Cebu), which where I'm from. Which would probably arrive at August. And since I've got a few month before I could actually get my hands on Pepper, I'd like to be ready and learn developing an application so that when Pepper arrives, I could directly test my application.  Sorry for my english btw."
robotics,387788,wtf_irl,2,Tue Jun 2 14:56:59 2015 UTC,"Congratulations for buying a Pepper out of Japan. How did you manage to do that?  For the rest, working with NAO resources is the best way to start. Since it's almost the same OS that is running on Pepper and NAO, you can get familiar with NAOqi for NAO before receiving your Pepper.  Once you receive it, you'll have access to Pepper resources, and you'll see it's not that different from NAO from a developer point of view.  To access NAO's resources, you can create a free account on http://community.aldebaran.com. Im the community leader, so Im easy to find on the website (and to reach by PM) if you want to ask more specific questions. My first name is Nicolas  I hope you'll have fun developing for Pepper anyway. What kind of things would you like to create for Pepper?  Best!"
robotics,387788,duyhtq,2,Tue Jun 2 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"The Japanese company I worked at only bought 4 Pepper's since all 300+(?) were all sold out pretty quick in a few minutes. and They're shipping the other 2 here to the Philippine Branch.   I'm DEFINELTY sure I'd have fun when Pepper arrives. Since my knowledge on Choregraphe is still pretty basic so I couldn't think if my idea are possible or not, but  I think one of the ideas I could think of is something like a Medical Assistant. Where you could ask Pepper for assistance in the hospital whether it's customer assistance or ask what your symptoms are and give a possible result of what your ""illness"" is, and recommends you to a doctor/s who specialises the sickness and maybe filter the doctors who accept different kind of health insurance. And Pepper has this clean look which looks perfect in hospitals.   Thanks for the help, Nicolas. See you around in the aldebaran community."
robotics,389430,stowie1021,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:28:32 2015 UTC,Only roundup I could find with all the robots competing this weekend. Who do you guys think will win? I got CHIMP taking it down.
robotics,389430,jens009,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"iHMC did very well in the trials. They also had a preview of them doing the tasks. Seems like they have a very decent shot. They've been a favorite since their success with the VRC and the DRC trials.  MIT and WPI-CMU had open sessions and they also seem to be very ready. MIT's software is high in quality and WPI had that video showing them completing all the required tasks.   Chimp wont even fall so it has that huge advantage in terms of control, but I don't remember it being able to drive the car, so they might lose points there. We'll see if they somehow found a way to drive the vehicle.  My professor has his bet on the Japanese teams simply because they've been doing humanoid robots and manipulation tasks for a while now. SCHAFT for example did very well in the trials.  But, these new Japanese teams are a year behind in terms of getting ready for the DARPA challenge so I have my doubts since in any competition, those who had more time tend to do better.  Overall, I'm excited about the new ideas and insights that the teams will publish after the competition."

robotics,3868nw,Eruditass,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:25:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  Robotics is growing a lot and there is much more than research level work to do.    For CV/SLAM, hardware experience isn't that important, though understanding sensors is helpful.  Where are you located?"
robotics,3868nw,Eruditass,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:41:21 2015 UTC,North East US.  Why is hardware experience not that important for SLAM? I've not had that observation.
robotics,3868nw,bradleypowers,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"Often you have a hardware group that handles the hardware.  As an algorithm developer, you need to understand how the sensors work for modeling uncertainty correctly, but most of your work is in statistics, probability, linear algebra, software engineering, framework design, reading papers, etc.    It's important to have done that work with real world data and sensors, but by hardware experience I mean electronics design, low level programming, motor control, FPGAs, systems design, mechanical, etc.  Drivers and integration experience are helpful of course but not what I meant by hardware experience.  A company I consult for in Pittsburgh was looking for someone to do software robotics work (mapping, AI, cv, integration) and is even considering remote workers.  anyone who wants to hear more shoot me a PM"

robotics,382n1c,notamedclosed,-1,Tue Jun 2 09:01:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting, but I wonder why everyone in there is going for quadcopters instead of hexacopters, the advantage of having six rotors over four is that you don't need to tilt the chassis to advance and can do very sharp turns."
robotics,382n1c,NonRock,8,Tue Jun 2 08:16:18 2015 UTC,"It would, but these mini racing quads are designed to maximize thrust-to-weight ratio, and a prop shroud built durable enough to withstand an impact at racing speeds would significantly increase the overall weight of the build. Many of these quads only weigh around 500 - 600g, including the LiPo battery."
robotics,382n1c,drhugs,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:56:14 2015 UTC,"If the organizing body makes prop guards mandatory, nobody has a disadvantage in competition."
robotics,382n1c,hobotron,10,Mon Jun 1 14:02:43 2015 UTC,"It's not so much about advantage/disadvantage, it's about physics.  If you added strong enough guards to survive full speed forward impacts it would be far too heavy.  These things are quite fast but they only have about 6-8 minutes of flight time when flown aggressively.  Any additional weight would cause a sharp drop in flight time.    Anyway, like many activities there are consumables.  Race cars burn out tires, racing quads break props.  They are cheap enough that it's not an issue."
robotics,382n1c,hobotron,4,Mon Jun 1 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, this. The other reason you want props to break is that they absorb some of the energy from an impact, whereas shrouds would transmit energy into the frame and probably result in damage to more expensive components. The props, and to a lesser extent the arms, could be thought of as a ""crumple zone""."
robotics,382n1c,MasteroRave,3,Mon Jun 1 16:23:50 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see the eventual quadcopter dog-fighting that's going to come out of this.   I'm betting these are the humble beginnings of a sport that will be worth millions in the next 10 years.

robotics,38429j,gsav55,3,Mon Jun 1 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"Well if you have a laser rangefinder or any kind of ranger, you can use a particle filter. You can try to look into the amcl ROS node. If you can use ROS, then there you go, otherwise you can read the doc to try and re-implement it yourself :p. Or lookup other (non-ROS) implementations."
robotics,38429j,nomiros,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:10:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for this.  What would prevent me from being able to use ROS?
robotics,38429j,nomiros,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:26:39 2015 UTC,"The platform you're using. For instance, I work with Khepera3 robots, which are running Linux, but the libs are so old I could never even hope to install ROS core and the required components on it. So I run everything ROS on my laptop, and use a network interface (Player) to drive the robots. Pretty sure most modern Linux-based robots would be able to run ROS. Though a particle filter could be a lot of computation to make for a robot CPU.  If you can run ROS, there's another notable advantage, it's that you can actually map the room with it (with a SLAM node, like gmapping), save and use the resulting map, and use it with amcl afterward :p"
robotics,38429j,nomiros,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:15:08 2015 UTC,"Cool thanks.  I was originally thinking about putting a Raspberry Pi on the robot itself.  However I think that I may just use an Arduino Mega and put a blue tooth module on it.  Then I should only have to transmit the Range finder and angle data across it and compute everything on my computer.  I was thinking about using a stepper motor to spin my rangefinder around, but to get the angle data I'd also need a rotary encoder, right?  I'll be able to know how many 'steps' my motor takes, but I won't know the starting angle.  Is there a simple way around this?"
robotics,38429j,chris_jump,2,Wed Jun 3 11:58:12 2015 UTC,"A pi would certainly run ROS without problems, and independently from a fixed computer (plus less latency), although if you're only planning to use the robot in range of a computer, Arduino's a pretty good solution too.  you're making your own rangefinder then ? (sort of). Pretty hard work I guess, but given the price of those things, perfectly understandable. As for detecting the starting angle, I'm no electronics specialist (I'm a programmer really) maybe you could make a detector that triggers when it's in a given position ? (two bits of metal coming into contact at a given angle). Then you'd just have to spin once upon powerup and you'd know the angle. Still, you'd need pretty accurate sensors for a good result."
robotics,38429j,anders987,3,Wed Jun 3 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"A* is navigation / path planning, which implies but doesn't provide localisation. Have a look at Monte Carlo Localisation, also called a particle filter (there is a good ROS RBPF implementation called AMCL). Another traditional approach would be an extended kalman filter but it's unimodal. If you want to get into this topic, read Probabilistic Robotics by Thrun, Fox and Burgard."
robotics,38429j,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  What is meant by unimodal in this context?  I'll have to check out that text as well, thanks for the suggestion."
robotics,38429j,chris_jump,3,Tue Jun 2 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Unimodal means that there's only one estimation at a time, while a multimodal distribution can model several estimations at once. A Gaussian distribution is unimodal for instance, it has one expected value and a bell curve centered around that."

robotics,38429j,robojunkie,2,Tue Jun 2 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"As /u/anders987 correctly explained, it means that the probability density over the robot pose is estimated with a model allowing for only a single hypothesis. In this case it's a gaussian / normal distribution. The particle filter on the other hand can handle multiple hypotheses at the same time, which is good because sensor data is usually pretty ambiguous at a short time scale. Just imagine two long featureless corridors with one that ends in a round room and one that ends in a square room. If you start at the beginning of either, your guess about which corridor you're in will be 50/50 until you reach the room at the end, at which point one hypothesis will collapse and your estimation will converge. Sorry for the brevity, on mobile and abroad :)"

robotics,38429j,army_of_monkeys,2,Wed Jun 3 11:59:46 2015 UTC,"Sebastian Thrun has an online course on Udacity called Artificial Intelligence for Robotics, Programming a Robotic Car where he covers some localization, particle filters, etc.  Localization in a known map using a range finder is one of the most common examples used for particle filters, like in this video, so there's plenty of resources available in that area. The problem is also called pose estimation, if you want another term to search for."
robotics,3833cw,ataraxic89,2,Mon Jun 1 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"The generalized math necessary for kinematics is pretty complex linear algebra and not fit for an introductory class unless it's 400 level.

We did not discuss sensors even when we were talking about mapping an environment and motion planning. We never discussed noise.

After JPL my professors were forwarding me resumes, and asking me for job recommendations,  so i took an engineering job developing manufacturing robots for a big electronics manufacturing company and dropped out.... Plot twist! after 2 years of not being in school I'm back. In fear of getting stuck with an exceptionally shitty manager at the manufacturing company, i decided to finish my degree. So here i am. This time my sights are set on grad school in robotics,  or more specifically computational cognitive science. Do you have a goal beyond graduating and finding a job?

robotics,37wl7q,GreyMX,3,Tue Jun 2 06:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm extremely biased because most of what I do is software development, but if you're looking to invest time towards improving your hireability, I would recommend learning to be a really solid software engineer.  My BSc was in aerospace engineering, and I've been working in computer science labs since I graduated. I've seen the kind of code that's written by mechanical/electrical/aerospace engineers, as well as computer scientists who don't take software engineering seriously. I used to be one of them. There's a universe of difference between the code written by a casual programmer versus what's written by someone who leverages good software engineering practices. And I don't just mean differences in how reliably code works or how fast it runs. I'm talking about how reusable code is. How easy it is for someone else to come along and understand the code. How maintainable the code is (e.g. as new algorithms, methods, or use cases come out, how well the code base can be updated to accommodate new things).  To relate it to mechanical engineering, it's like the difference between wrapping two parts up in duct tape to keep them together versus using CAD software to plan out locations for standardized screw sizes, picking the threading for those screws, and doing a stress analysis to ensure that it meets the design criteria.  Your focus might be in mechanical and electrical engineering, but that's only one small part of the battle in modern robotics. These days, roboticists are often expected to be able to do everything, even if they might have a focus in a particular area. If you can speak competently about good software engineering practices even as a mechanical/electrical engineer, your value to your team will improve drastically."
robotics,37wl7q,b10nic84,3,Sun May 31 02:16:09 2015 UTC,This is a major goal for me this summer. My program is rooted in Computer and Electrical Engineering with a fair amount of programming but I know that I need to push my programming chops to a new level. Could you recommend any good resources for good standards of practice? I am mostly working in C here.
robotics,37wl7q,GreyMX,3,Sun May 31 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"Offhand, I don't know many resources because I learned software engineering largely from experience, and a little bit from nibbling at various websites and blogs.  I'm not surprised that you mostly use C, because (besides MATLAB) it seems like that's the only language used by mechanical & electrical engineers. Even when a Mech E codes in C++, their style tends to resemble C code more than C++ code. I fight on the C++ side of the holy war between the C and C++ languages. Now more than ever it's a good time to start learning modern C++, because the language is having a sort of second renaissance with the new features of C++11, C++14, and soon C++17.  But regardless of which you choose, if you root around on Google and StackOverflow you'll be able to find lists of good resources. Here's one for C and then here's an official ISO page on standards for C++. I also recommend subscribing to the subreddit of whichever language you choose.  Now learning best practices for a given language isn't exactly software engineering, but it will push you in the right direction. Software engineering, as taught at a higher education institute, is more abstract and tends to focus on interfaces between software modules and input/output relationships. But I think if you master (or at least get comfortable with) the best practices for your language of choice, you'll be able to figure out how to be a software engineer easily enough.  Edit: Also, it's worth noting that you won't be able to nail down everything in one summer, especially if you try to pick up C++. Your goal for the summer should be to pick up the fundamentals, enough that you're able to feel comfortable with writing good code and you're able to recognize when code is bad (even though the code works) and identify why it's bad."
robotics,37wl7q,WiggleBooks,3,Sun May 31 02:58:18 2015 UTC,"Consider learning ladder logic or structured text.  This is what ""hard real time"" systems use and it is a ubiquitous industry standard (IEC 61131).   PLC's, industrial robots, motion controllers, distributed control systems, industrial networks and other automation will all have an element of ladder logic, so it is worth learning. All the big equipment suppliers like Omron, Siemens, Mitsubishi, Allen Bradley, Yaskawa etc use it. You just don't really see C++ used for these applications. Although C++ can be compiled to run on real time operating systems, it typically isn't the right tool for the job.  It depends what you want from your career, but ladder really is where the hardware meets the software. Just my 2 cents."
robotics,37wl7q,GreyMX,2,Sun May 31 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely true for traditional jobs in industry, but is becoming less and less true in the newer R&D aspects of robotics which are trying to shove arbitrarily more intelligence into robot systems.

robotics,37wl7q,tlalexander,2,Sun May 31 05:51:19 2015 UTC,"EE is a fantastic segue into robotics, especially if your goal is designing controllers.   How do I strengthen my mechanical knowledge for use in robotics?   This mostly depends on what you mean by ""mechanical knowledge"" and what you want to use that knowledge for. If you only care about designing controllers, then just study dynamics. You should have a very strong grasp on differential equations already since you have an EE degree. The study of dynamics is pretty much just applying differential equations and vector calculus to complex systems (such as mechanical systems and robots). If you intend to do grad school, then just take some graduate level dynamics courses. If you intend to study on your own, there are many controls-centric textbooks that will tell you what you need to know about dynamics for robots. The Springer Handbook of Robotics is usually a good resource. Otherwise, here's some books that were on the reading list for my PhD program:   Choset, H. et al., Principles of Robot Motion: Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations Sciavicco, L. and Siciliano, B. Modelling and Control of Robot Manipulators Spong, M.W., Hutchinson, S. and Vidyasagar, M., Robot Modeling and Control Jazar, Reza N., Theory of Applied Robotics: Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control   Now, on the other hand, if you want ""mechanical knowledge"" in order to do mechanical design for physical robots, then that's a whole other matter. Nothing short of a BSc in Mechanical Engineering or a several year long job/internship with hands on experience will make that possible."

robotics,37utg4,Sokonomi,4,Sat May 30 19:18:41 2015 UTC,"Taking just the first pick as an example, it seems to take about 26 seconds in the video so 104 seconds in real time. Pick rates over 380 units per hour per picker have been achieved in Kiva-enabled Amazon warehouses. That's about 9.5 seconds per pick, and while not the average it's not a bad number to use for some back-of-the-envelope calculations. At those rates this machine is 1/11th the speed of a picker.   The thing is, it's not 1/11th the cost. It probably costs tens of thousands of dollars, plus millions in development costs, but once set up it's likely pennies per hour for electricity/maintenance.  It doesn't have to be as good as a human. It just has to be cost-effective enough that you can throw multiple of them at the problem and achieve the same result as people with less money."
robotics,37utg4,neamhdhuine,3,Sat May 30 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"Id love to see the test environment for those numbers. Are those real order picks, or just ""grab one item as many times as you can in 1 hour"" type of deal.  And a 5 or maybe even 6 DOF robotic arm, you betcha that thing will cost a lot. Have you seen the machines amazon uses to load pallets? Its basically the same thing.  Im wondering something though, why does this arm have to be mobile? Don't the Kiva's already park in the exact same spot all the time already? And if the same goes for order picking crates, why not make it stationary so it will become infinitesimally easier on their software?"
robotics,37utg4,Sokonomi,1 point,Sat May 30 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"Not a test environment, real numbers achieved at the BFI1 warehouse (And I know DFW7 did some ungodly fast picking last peak, but I'm not sure if I can share those without having legal/HR bring the axe on my head). You mean the Robostow system in use at non-sort sites like OAK3/DFW6? I'm very familiar with it. If you're talking about something else, then no. Kiva drive units do bring their pods to the same place each time, so I'm not certain why this would need to be mobile given the current implementation. However, the mobility would support a pick-wall scenario where multiple pods presented faces simultaneously and the robot could move between them."
robotics,37utg4,neamhdhuine,1 point,Sat May 30 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"So this machine has been tested to pick any item big or small it might come across, with an average of under 10 seconds per pick? Then why is it so painfully slow on the video? Its just having a bad day? ;) And yes, I was talking about this big beautiful beast. Its less sophisticated though seems to suffice plenty. The machine in the video just seems needlessly complicated? If the Kivas all line up, wouldn't it still be simpler to work with a rail/gantry system much like a plotter? Much easier to maintain plus a lot more stable. Likely quite a bit cheaper too."
robotics,37utg4,Sokonomi,1 point,Sat May 30 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand. I said human pickers hit 10s/pick to provide a baseline against which to compare this machine's ~100s/pick. The variance in stowing a pallet is miniscule, so the system is simpler. Pallets are all the same size, they are all starting in the same position, they end in the same position, and the end effector only has to support pallets. Compare that to picking where products are in different bins, the robot has to identify which product in that bin is the correct one, then it has to manipulate it without damaging it. If one arm is going to pick plushies (like the chocobo in this video) as well as shampoo, hard plastic toys, books, etc, the end effector is significantly more important. I don't know enough about rail systems to evaluate stability, cost, or effectiveness, but I assume Amazon did their homework before buying Kiva and went that route instead with a rail system because it's a better solution."
robotics,37utg4,neamhdhuine,1 point,Sat May 30 23:06:19 2015 UTC,"It also missed grabbing the last item, and didn't seem to notice, which would be a big problem if 1 in 12 items were missing. But obviously, this is just a research demo."

robotics,37utg4,sixwings,4,Sun May 31 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just wanna clear up a couple of questions. Firstly, this is very early research and wont be ready for production any time soon.  I see a lot of people questioning the rate at which the robot can pick objects. The requirements for this competition was to pickup 12 objects in 20 minutes. The speed was setup up with this time constraint in mind.   The mobile base with whole body control is useful, because it allows the end effector to reach places it wouldnt be able to otherwise. Its arm (Barret WAM) is 7 DOF by the way...  For this competition there was a set of 27 objects to collect. Obviously this task will become ALOT more difficult in the real world, with a larger range of objects, but as said before, this is very early research. Grasping all objects, large, small, heavy and light, is an extremely difficult task.  And by the way im part of team RBO ;) You are welcome to ask any questions  edit: Heres a link to the competition website http://amazonpickingchallenge.org/details.shtml"

Your question leaves an awful lot to be interpreted. Are you a non-US student who is looking for a BSc program in the United States? Are you a non-US student looking for a BSc program outside the United States? Those are two very very different things which will have little to do with whether or not you want to do robotics. Going to a school inside versus outside of the United States is entirely a matter of money, because US schools are absurdly expensive for international students.

robotics,37q6et,PDiddily,7,Fri May 29 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"ESCHER currently draws about 500 watts balancing in place. Most of the power draw is actually from the on-board instrumentation and computing. Four quad-core processors running full tilt can eat up a lot of energy over time. In situations requiring fast movement, we see short transient spikes up to 850 W. ESCHER has a relatively low power draw for a full-size humanoid. This is due to our efficient series-elastic linear actuators in the legs, careful choice of computing and sensors, combined with advanced DC-DC converters. The entire system runs off a set of four 22.2 V 8 Ah lithium-polymer batteries from MaxAmps. We designed the system to use far larger 22 Ah batteries, but will stick with the smaller units for the competition. Each competition run is only an hour, and our small batteries can give us twice that.  -Jack Teams have One hour to complete as many of the following tasks as possible.  Teams choose if they will start in the Polaris or walk the 1st part of the course.  Driving will earn you a point and getting out of the vehicle will earn you a point.  After that we need to open a door to ""enter"" the disaster area.  Once indoors degraded communications kicks in.  Inside the disaster area is a rubble pile or difficult terrain to cross, a valve to close, a wall that needs a hole cut in it and a surprise task.  Each of those is worth a point.  Finally we leave the degraded communications area and have a set of stairs we need to climb.  The total available points is 8.  ties will be broken by speed.  -Semi The scaffolding is a mobile gantry, used to catch the robot if it falls over during testing. Since we only have the one ESCHER, most of our testing is with the robot loosely attached to the gantry to minimize downtime and repairs. It’ll be very exciting to cut ESCHER loose and let him walk free during the competition!  -Jason Ziglar"
robotics,37q6et,PDiddily,3,Fri May 29 16:25:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know a lot about robotics myself, so bear with me. Could you explain the linear actuators and how they work? And what makes them more efficient?  I'm assuming the batteries are rechargable. How are they recharged (do you have to remove them or do you just plug Escher in)? If they are rechargeable, how long does it take to fully charge both the smaller and larger battery?  New question, how does Escher know how much pressure to use in its grasping? Is there some sort of safety limitation? Will the grasping motion ever be used on soft tissue e.g. injured human or a dog?  Learning is fun! Knowledge is power!"
robotics,37q6et,PDiddily,3,Fri May 29 16:40:53 2015 UTC,"We welcome all kinds of questions and appreciate your interest, so no problems there!   Some robots have started transitioning from rigid position-based actuators (think pick-and-place or assembly line robot arms) to series elastic actuators (SEAs) to provide compliance and safe operation through force control. The linear SEAs used on ESCHER combine an efficient electric linear actuator with a titanium leaf spring as the elastic element. A Maxon brushless DC motor spins a THK precision ground low-backlash ball screw through a 3:1 timing pulley reduction – this changes the rotational energy of the motor to translational energy in an efficient (~90%) and low-friction manner. Force is transmitted from the ball nut to the robot frame through a load bearing carbon fiber tube, and a Futek axial load cell directly measures this actuator force. The cantilevered titanium leaf spring acts as a mechanical low-pass filter to handle shock loads, and the beam is also the primary mounting location of the actuator to the robot frame. Universal joints (allowing 2-DOF) at each end of the actuator constrain it as a two-force member to eliminate damaging bending loads from passing through the ball screw. The peak force is +/- 2225 N (500 lb) and maximum speed is around 0.2 m/s. Using the relative motor encoder, absolute joint encoder, and actuator load cell, we have implemented a custom impedance controller (ELI5 – varying your position to maintain a force) which runs on both the actuator and joint levels. This SEA has a high power-to-weight ratio and a small packaging volume which enable us to use them on our humanoid robots. Tests have been done on a custom actuator test stand and our video from Humanoids 2014 shows some of these tests.  -Coleman The batteries are rechargeable. We simply pop off a plate on the front of the robot, take them out, and attach them to an off-board charger. One planned upgrade is to integrate a charger directly into the power system. Charging the small ones takes about an hour, the larger ones take over three hours, depending on how drained they are.  -Jack In our current framework, Escher does not control how much force it grasps with. However, we do use a method called impedance control on the hands and the legs, which essentially varies the force to maintain a certain position. This allows for some compliance in the fingers themselves, as well as Escher's entire lower body. If you notice in  some of our videos, the lower body actually moves when we push on the robot, which is impedance control in practice! We can then use similar methods to prescribe torques and positions to the fingers, allowing them to grasp with a certain force. With a certain knowledge of what we are trying to grasp, we can then close the hands until we get the torque required to pick something up! There is also a lot of ongoing research in the manipulation field on applying machine learning and other techniques to grasping different objects, so that the more times the robot attempts to grasp something, the more these attempts improve. This takes knowledge of the object slipping, the loading of the motors, and many other things into account. Additionally, due to the relationship between motor torque and current, it is relatively easy to limit the forces of the hands, putting a ceiling on how much force we apply, which can be adjusted for different situations. We can also read forces through the load-cells in the arm joints, so we know if we are running into something, and can stop the motors. With this technology applied to the hands, we can grasp quite safely, and will someday soon get this working fully on our arms, allowing safe interaction with both people, and, as you mentioned, dogs, too!  -Robert"

As part of the DRC, DARPA has been a great beneficiary of robotics research to many teams, including ours. Additionally, we have a large amount of support from the Virginia Tech College of Engineering, who has been very gracious towards making this competition possible for us. Outside the DRC, though, our lab does a significant amount of fundraising. We get corporate sponsors such as HDT, Maxon, NetApp, THK, Rapid and the GM Foundation, who provide a variety of support, from discounted parts, to hardware, to even monetary donations. Lastly, like many other research labs, we apply for grants and government contracts from organizations such as DARPA, the NSF, and the Office of Naval Research.  -Robert Griffin"

If you're interested in the more mechanical aspects of robotics you can do an awful lot with a band saw, drill press and dremel.  On the software and control side there's a lot of great free software out there that we use on ESCHER, such as ROS and Gazebo.  Both are Linux software so being at least familiar with Linux is important.  Both our electromechanical and software teams are heavily dependent on version control programs such as Git.  We always tell beginners that lego mindstorms are a great place to start out, you're basically getting all the same equipment we use, servos, encoders and cameras just not quite as expensive.

Fortunately outside machine shops such as Rapid Manufacturing were able to help us pick up the slack.  Good CAD/CAM techniques and knowing your feeds an speeds will serve you well in design.  Very small features can mean the difference between a 2 hour part and a 10 hour part, and if you're going to outside manufacturer's a $200 dollar part can become a $2000 part.

I'm an upcoming junior CS major that has finished a couple individual robotics projects, but I've been wanting to get into an actual university robotics competition that wouldn't cost over $15,000 (This is the current internship money I have). The robosub seemed amazing at first, but when I looked at Cornell's project (~40 undergrads, $40,000 overall cost) I realized that I was quickly way in over my head.

I was wondering how your perception is and what are some challenges you're running into with respect to autonomy / perception.  Are you using many ros packages for perception, if so which ones?"
robotics,37q6et,Sonny_Dreams,3,Fri May 29 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"As mentioned earlier, we use two sensors, a stereo camera and a laser range finder.  Our lidar is used primarily for obstacle avoidance.  Laser scans are used to estimate surface heights and normal for footstep planning.  These scans are also fed into an octomap to generate grid maps for obstacle avoidance for both our manipulation and locomotion planning.   Since our system is only partially autonomous, most of our perception efforts are focused on getting data to human operators for them to do object recognition and localization for the manipulation tasks.  Our operator control station displays both images from the stereo camera as well as assembled point clouds so that the operators may align object templates with the received 3D data using interactive markers and a modified RViz. We have looked into doing this automatically using point cloud and mesh alignment techniques from PCL however they are not quite reliable enough for our needs.  One of the main issues we have run into is the sparsity of our range data.  The stereo camera provides a great deal of depth data, but it has lower accuracy than the lidar.  The lidar only provides planar scans of the world, so to get complete scans, we must rotate it about its axis.  This reduces our effective scan rate from 40 Hz to approximately 1 Hz.  Many techniques for working with point clouds assume that uniform dense data is available and in our case the point clouds are neither particularly dense norm uniformly distributed.  -John Peterson (Johnson)"
robotics,37q6et,rkitect101,5,Fri May 29 20:40:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing this AMA! 1. Do linear actuators have backlash? Other humanoid robots use harmonic (and planetary) geared motors that cost tens of thousands for each joint, just to reduce backlash. Also, is this the first humanoid to walk with linear actuators, I've never seen one before 2. Do you think using electronic actuators gives an advantage over the hydraulic system in Atlas? (strength vs. running time)"
robotics,37q6et,BotJunkie,3,Fri May 29 20:03:19 2015 UTC,"It's nearly impossible to eliminate backlash in any mechanical system, the goal is to reduce it. The SEAs on ESCHER feature custom precision ground ball screws from THK, which have nearly imperceivable backlash. In addition, all of the bearings in the actuator subsystem are preloaded to reduce backlash to a negligible amount. We have done some high-speed digital image correlation (DIC) which measures the deflections of the actuator on a rigid test stand, and have found our overall backlash to be on the order of ~1/100 mm IIRC.  The first linearly actuated walking robot? No, and I am not sure which would be considered the first (does a robot walking with the support of a boom count, for instance). Perhaps we are the first untethered electric linearly actuated robot, but that starts to sound like a football statistic.  Electric actuators certainly have their tradeoffs. In comparison to hydraulics they have a much lower power density, which means that we must use clever mechanisms and joint arrangements to achieve a sufficient amount of joint torque. For benefits, electric motors tend to run much quieter, weigh less, are cleaner and safer, and are slightly less complex to service. From what I heard from other teams, our actuator bandwidth is comparable to the ATLAS's (~30 hz force bandwidth).  -Coleman"

robotics,37q6et,auxilary,7,Fri May 29 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"The wireless link to ESCHER is an 802.11ac link, just like you might find on a new wireless router. DARPA degrades the communication much further than the wireless link (9600 baud to/from the robot, 300 Mbps back which flickers in and out.) In order to handle this, we have to  come up with software which compresses messages and manages which messages are sent between the two sides. We also have to have autonomy onboard which can communicate with higher level messages - instead of telling the robot “Put your joints at these angles” we can say “Move your arm to grasp the handle” and allow the robot to determine how to do so safely. This lets us send smaller messages with bigger results. ESCHER has two primary sensors for seeing the world. The first is a stereoscopic camera pair which is used to provide denser color and depth information - this data is very rich, but bandwidth intensive (it consumes a dedicated gigabit ethernet bus onboard!) and requires consideration of noise. Stereo can see to the horizon, but has more error the further away the robot looks. We also have a rolling LIDAR sensor which provides sparser but more accurate geometric data out to 30 meters. ESCHER is also capable of carrying two long wave infrared cameras, which are used to do perception in smoky and fire-filled environments, such as those encountered in the SAFFiR project.   -Jason Ziglar"

robotics,37qfb0,loosedata,5,Fri May 29 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"I'm planning something similar (I have bought an old Robosapien V2 so I can modify it to do something cool) and I have done some wifi controlled robotics with vision. It's not as complex as it sounds if you accept some lag with UVC USB webcam -> OpenWrt router -> MJPG over WIFI approach. Also you should be ready that not every feature of your robot will be done simultaneously, it'll take some trial and error. Be patient.  My recommendations are:   Control over internet is most easily done like this: you buy small wifi router that runs openwrt (check http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start ) and has USB port (I did it with TP-LINK MR3020) or carambola board (essentially the same router). Also it should have UART, you'll probably have to solder it yourself. Flash the router to openwrt, setup ser2net (to pass commands over TCP) and mjpg-streamer, configure them a bit (read manuals, tutorials, etc). Set up your router to be in your PC's wifi network, you should be able to ping it by direct IP. Buy arduino (or any other mcu you happen to like, I used both stm32f103 and recently arduinos) and connect it to your router's UART (via level-shifter if needed). Buy a USB webcam, connect to router, check that mjpg-streamer works. This is a platform for streaming serial commands to arduino (via router's UART and ser2net). Now you just have to write arduino code to control robosapien motors via robosapien H-bridges (probably the code will have to read mechanical encoder switches to know that robosapien's body part has moved to desired position, note that encoders are crude so you won't get your smooth movement if you replace them with something else). You'll have to cleave PCB traces that lead to H-bridges on robosapien's MB and solder them to arduino outputs. If you don't want the complexity of H-bridge approach and you are ready to sacrifice some generality you can fallback on https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/wiki/ArduinoConnectionCode . When you wrote that code all that is left is to add a serial command interpreter to arduino so you can control it from your pc's console (or even GUI application that sends bytes to that ser2net socket). Speaker can be connected to arduino via DAC, 8khz sampling is enough for speech, but not enough to saturate your arduino <-> router UART link.   Other people here advise you to read serious college-level physics textbooks, but I don't think it's really necessary to accomplish this project. It's just some simple digital electronics (""attach arduino output pins to robosapien's H-bridge inputs, connect power lines) and general linux hackery. The best and easiest way to master hardware/linux hackery is to read a lot of good tutorials and make stuff. You can always read your rigid body dynamics and circuit theory textbooks later, when you'll want to build your own MIT cheetah :)  For this project I would recommend:  http://www.markcra.com/robot/hackrobos.php http://www.evosapien.com/html/robosapien-hacks-experts.php http://www.jbprojects.net/projects/wifirobot/ http://www.ediy.com.my/index.php/blog/item/33-tp-link-tl-wr1043nd-router-%20-web-cam-=-ip-cam http://www.societyofrobots.com/schematics_h-bridgedes.shtml And general tutorials on arduino."

Just the other day I threw together a robot made with this chassis, an atmega 168A, some chinese 5v lithium ion phone/tablet charger, a PS3 eye, a tiny usb wifi adapter, and a pogoplug ($15 shipped! It's a raspberry-pi-like PC!). I bought about a square foot of thin plexiglass and some standoffs and added another level to the chassis for the boards and camera (battery took up most of the base level). OS is debian, main control program is in python. The pogoplug talks with the avr through an ftdi board, though I'd like to use the serial connection on the pogoplug itself eventually. The avr controls the motors with a single SN754410 quad half h-bridge. I SSH into it from my main PC and send commands to the python program, while motion streams video back to me from the PS3 eye. Took less than a day to build and whip up a crude control program for it. All off-the shelf parts except for some connectors I made, cheap, and plenty of things to expand/improve on.

Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences by Boas is a great reference book for math topics including linear algebra, complex numbers, vector analysis, Fourier series, and differential equations which is taught alongside Classical Mechanics at my university.

And to be fair, I did very little physics analysis on my undergraduate robotics project. I actually wrote the software for it. For most hobby robotics projects, you will not need any physics or electronics experience. If you want to do robotics for a living, you'll want to have a broad understanding of most topics.   To be fair, I am not in the robotics industry yet. I am starting a Masters this Fall.  Just for reference, here is what my masters program considers base knowledge to begin study in robotics: http://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri_static_content.html?menu_id=454  If you want to seriously have a career in robotics, you probably will need at least a Masters unless your university has a strong robotics focus where you can take a ton of classes.   And I just graduated in Electrical Engineering with taking extra CS and computer Engineering Courses.   I was just telling someone that if I could do it again I would get a CS major with an ME and EE double minor. I would highly recommend that a CS major take some EE or ME courses just like I would advise an ME or EE take some CS courses. Robotics is the merging of EE, ME, and CS.   I can't really say ME or EE would be more valuable. I would probably say if you just chose one to go ME, because it is more removed from CS than EE and will give you a broader focus. A CS major win experience in ME courses and EE would be more competitive for grad school as well.   If you chose ME, I would take courses on Dynamics, control, etc. If you chose EE, I would take courses on control and electronics."
robotics,37qfb0,poez,3,Sat May 30 13:33:45 2015 UTC,"I once tried a very similar project with a robosapien X but it didn't end well. There are a bunch of online hacks for the programming but many are abandoned half code. The camera to transmit what he sees will be an expensive pain to setup yourself and you probably wont have space for custom systems inside it, my suggestion, take his head off and put a small android phone there with Skype instead, easy done and no point reinventing what thousands of mobile companies have already perfected. Pulling apart the Robosapien was hard too, it wasn't really made for disassembly / reassembly and it explains why many robot projects have their guts constantly hanging out. In my case on top of being unable to get the hacked software to play nice a small internal plastic gear broke and that was it, id wasted a few hundred dollars and weeks of time. As a side note don't use an old robosapien as the plastic ages and goes brittle very quick, lots of repair guys confirmed this when mine broke. In fact through my own experience I found everything about robotics much harder than I thought it would be and became a process of lowering expectations, on the positive side it makes you understand why robots are designed and built the way they are and how the prices can go from a few hundred dollars to a hundred thousand dollars very quickly. Final suggestion, mess around with basic arduino / motor shield robots first."

I studied cat gaits briefly in the context of neuroscience, so here's some more info:  If you read the wikipedia article on gaits, you see that front limbs together + back limbs together is called a bound.  Fast running with staggered footfalls is one of several kinds of gallop.  I found one article with some interesting observations:   As you noted, dogs & horses don't bound, they gallop.  (as you note)  This gait requires less bending of the spine. Rabbits bound (as you note), and bounding is commonly found in the smaller mammals. Cheetahs sometimes do bound but they usually gallop, and they also do what's called a half-bound, where either the front legs are together and the back legs are staggered, or the other way around.   I also found this picture of a cheetah  mid-half-bound, or at least half-bound, so they definitely sometimes do bound.

robotics,37n57x,Mr_Smartypants,1 point,Sun May 31 20:11:01 2015 UTC,"Gait:       Gait is the pattern of movement of the limbs of animals, including humans, during locomotion over a solid substrate. Most animals use a variety of gaits, selecting gait based on speed, terrain, the need to maneuver, and energetic efficiency. Different animal species may use different gaits due to differences in anatomy that prevent use of certain gaits, or simply due to evolved innate preferences as a result of habitat differences. While various gaits are given specific names, the complexity of biological systems and interacting with the environment make these distinctions 'fuzzy' at best. Gaits are typically classified according to footfall patterns, but recent studies often prefer definitions based on mechanics. The term typically does not refer to limb-based propulsion through fluid mediums such as water or air, but rather to propulsion across a solid substrate by generating reactive forces against it (which can apply to walking while underwater as well as on land).

Starting here you can see that they were depicting the robot with a 2D model. It's common practice in this field to reduce your robot to something lower dimensional. It's easier to model, design, test, debug, theorize about, and implement. Once the lower dimensional version is fully working, they might ramp up to a more complete model, or they might stick with the low dimensional model if the penalty (such as performance speed or difficulty of implementation) for the higher dimensional model is too much."

I mean if you go to the junk section of toy stores they have toys which already do that and there is limited appeal, less play value in fact as they are restricted to battery only and they cant compete with a remote controlled car let alone animated software entertainment like their ipads which they are all glued on. I feel like the kids will see through it pretty quick and theres really no point to learning how to program it, to do what? My suggestion for them would be to just make a mecano robotic arm with a decent gripper at a cheap price like the toy that was around in the 80's, I played with that thing forever but then if I had an ipad with endless apps id probably have dropped it pretty quick too. Sorry guys but like most robotic projects its better to have a point or goal to it to sell the kids on. If its learning programming then you don't need hardware for that, if its learning servos and electronics well there are already good kits out there very cheap and its better to learn whats out in the real world rather than a company specific set of parts."

I developed my budget version RambleBot of telepresence as a project and I can imagine weve gone through a lot of the same design issues, Id love to ask you some questions.  When you say wireless do you have a mobile hidden in there somewhere for 3G/4G or some kind of custom communication system?  I see you went with the two wheels and a coaster, I originally tried that but had trouble getting around over cables, rugs and small ledges etc, any plans to switch to tracks or legs? I was thinking of doing a larger tracked RambleBot but im worried about scuffing up peoples floors. Whats your feelings on ideal telepresence mobility bases?  Any plans to put an arm or gripper on it? I can imagine some kind of extremely articulated arm/gripper combo with a haptic controller plus your Rift and your head motion would make a really strong presence ability. I was thinking of doing some kind of  cheap glove control system as controlling my grippers with keyboard and mouse isn't that smooth but then the current ramblebot platforms aren't big enough to attach a proper heavy duty arm to open doors with which would be my future goal.

robotics,37h43o,Portis403,4,Wed May 27 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"This does, unfortunately, fail to address the reality that use of drones and autonomous weapons makes the human cost for the aggressor much cheaper, lowering the number of their troops in the field and therefore the public perception of those troops returning in body bags.   This, in turn, makes it much easier for those leaders to justify the use of military force since it has much less potential loss to the their own civilian population. The cost to the opposition civilian population seems to be less of a consideration, since one of the major stumbling blocks is always selling a new war to your own people. With that stumbling block removed, waging war by throwing money and resources at it, instead of throwing warm bodies at it, just becomes much easier while retaining a positive public perception.  Does this imply that leaders will be more willing to wage war against other nations, since the visible cost (in dead soldiers) is much lower?  Certainly that seems to already be the case for America, where the use of drones has allowed them to attack targets in many more countries simultaneously without putting as many of their own troops in harms way, and public perception remains positive. However, to those on the receiving end, militants and civilians alike, becoming a target just got much easier and much cheaper."
robotics,37h43o,fitzroy95,2,Wed May 27 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"I have been saying this one for a long time. That perversely it is better to have 19 year olds coming back in bags. The Iraq war would have been beyond nasty had there been no risk of that. Two long ago proposals were that any congressmen who vote for war would have effectively put their kids up for the draft. Or that there would have to be a referendum and anyone voting yes had just volunteered. Robot warriors are the opposite of those proposals.  The other thing is that the whole, ""Just following orders"" does apply to robots. If you order them to do nasty things then they will do nasty things and they won't take videos that they then leak to reporters.  This allows for a very small number of people to implement some truly horrific war crimes and potentially get away with it. Even if they don't get away with it there will have still been horrific war crimes based upon the whims of a tiny few.  But we tend to be thinking about the present generation of robots which are effectively remote controlled toys with hellfire missiles strapped to them.   If we look forward a number of generations then we are looking at weapons that can be given objectives instead of just orders. Objectives like, ""Help me overthrow my government by taking and holding the following locations.""   Or you wonder what that noise is only to find that your ""100% super encrypted perfectly secure"" robots have been reprogrammed and are wiping out your troops."
robotics,37h43o,EmperorOfCanada,2,Wed May 27 22:00:55 2015 UTC,You want terminators ? Because that's how you get terminators !
robotics,37h43o,fitzroy95,2,Wed May 27 22:10:22 2015 UTC,"I've never really thought terminators more like flying 9mm pistols and flying grenades.   You have a FOB and suddenly 3 waves of flying 9mm pistols come in each with one grenade. They are going around 60mph and jink in a nearly perfect random pattern. It is also very dark and the first wave of grenades are all black smoke grenades which don't obscure their targeting systems.  When they fire the 9mm pistols they don't miss. As in down to a left eye right eye kind of choice.  Also all 3 waves come in from all directions and at many heights including inches from the ground.   Then to add insult to injury many will hide on the base for the night waiting for people to be up and about before attacking.  They also are able to target things with the perfect attack. So fuel is hit with something explosive and flammable. Vehicles are hit exactly where they don't want to be hit. And the most valuable targets are identified and prioritized.   Oh and the cost per drone, under $2000."
robotics,37h43o,EmperorOfCanada,2,Thu May 28 00:13:46 2015 UTC,"To my mind, the flying 9mm pistols are a more realistic terminator.   You only need something more physically imposing if there is a door to be kicked in, otherwise small, mobile, able to hide easily, and carrying a moderate level of sensors (motion, infrared, sound, etc) and lethality makes much more sense. At the moment, the combination of multiple sensors, logic modules, barrel/magazine/ firing mechanism, power supply and flying motors would be more the size of a small quadcopter, but those technologies continue to shrink fast.  Or you could just use a swarm of butterfly sized objects containing a couple of grams of high-explosive each. Get close to target and detonate. Cheap, disposable, swarms to overrun defenses, easy to hide, takes out a wide range of targets"
robotics,37h43o,fitzroy95,2,Thu May 28 00:36:47 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet that a huge amount of money will be put into way more complicated robots for a long time.  Then either they will slowly realize that the ones we are describing are more effective. Or an enemy will teach them that lesson.

It starts from the base mathematics and works up through coordinate frames, kinematics, dynamics, localization, nativation, and computer vision.  The book uses MATLAB for all programming examples. As a CS major, you may not be familiar with it, but it's an excellent language/environment for matrices (which is a majority of the mathematics required for robotics).  As a student it's available for $99.  Theres also an open source clone of the project, GNU Octave."

robotics,37i7kh,omgnowai,2,Wed May 27 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you have graduated yet, but here is my recommendation for a course of self study:  Intro Physics I and II Calculus based - learn about circuits, kinematics, etc.  Intermediate Classical Mechanics and Dynamics - understand more about kinematics, Lagrangian Dynamics, etc. A book I like is Classical Mechanics by Taylor  Intro to Controls - PID controls specifically - there are a lot of good controls books out. I'm reading Control System Engineering by Nise  These are sort of introduction level stuff that is outside of CS. I am assuming you know about Machine Learning and Computer Vision. In the end, everything a robot does has to end up with movement. This means that Dynamics and Controls is really the only thing you need to add to your repertoire that is not CS.  Other areas like Embedded Programming and Microcontroller programming are all part of a CS curriculum and would be easier for you to pick up at an intermediate level.

You will take courses in multiple important areas including robotic kinematics, movement planning, and control that you may not have experience with. These will give you a broad understanding. If you want to do this as a hobby just sells read those books to get a basic understanding of the topics and then move to more advanced books that are specialized in those areas for robotics. Also, as a hobbyist there are plenty of kits that do most of this work for you."

But I realised why it wont work just before the last set of parts arrived :(.  The efficiency of this design is terrible. The inner gears are rotating your gear ratio times faster than the output but is subject to the full output torque in two different directions, so the efficiency of the gearbox is reduced by approximately a factor of twice the gear ratio. As soon as the power loss from the gears is greater than the input power the gears will seize. For very high reduction gearboxes this will happen even with no torque on the output.  P = Tw e_total = P_out / (P_out + P_loss) P_loss = 2*(1-e_gear)T_out*w_in e_total = T_out*w_out / (T_out * w_out + 2 * (1-e_gear)*T_out*T_in) e_total = 1 / (1 + 2 * (1-e_gear)*w_in/w_out)   This calculation is a close approximation for when the gear ratio is high, the error should be less than w_out/w_in."

If you're looking for indexing percision I'd suggest either a dogtooth lock or some brake system Incorperated into you're system to hold the assembly when not in motion with some accounting for backlash in your code.  If you do need a backlash free gearing system you could try a couple things, you could preloaded the shafts towards each other you you have contact on both  sides of the tooth.  The downside with this is it won't work as well for low pressure angle gears (teeth are too tall) and the shaft will need to be able to make to prevent binding.  This requires a good amount of system flexibility and can cause noise/vibration.  Additionally you could have a split-gear system with 2 gearhalvs preloaded against each other.  This will ensure that you always have contact on both faces.  For a general example look up a backlash-free worm gear.  You'd want to crown the teeth on the split gear to prevent uneven wear due to assembly tolerance.  The downside with this is you're output is only as stiff as the preloaded between the two halves of the split gear.  Additionally you'd again have noise.  For both of these systems you'd have a lower gearbox efficiency due to needing to overcome the frictions caused by the preloads.  What you could do is hook one of those $20 Chinese 700pulse/rotation encoders to the output and account for it in realtime.  A lot of options out there, you'll probably find something."

There are no examples of the correct solution like one would have in speech and vision recognition programs.”   But here, they seem to indicate otherwise...   BRETT takes in the scene, including the position of its own arms and hands, as viewed by the camera. The algorithm provides real-time feedback via the score based upon the robot’s movements. Movements that bring the robot closer to completing the task will score higher than those that do not. The score feeds back through the neural net, so the robot can learn which movements are better for the task at hand.   So they must have both a correct example, e.g. the lid is screwed on, and a way to estimate whether it's closing in on screwing that lid on. The latter I can see as a very interesting algorithm that they may be working on.  The algorithm must have some kind of end state(s) in mind that it considers correct.  Any insights?"

Which is awesome, but means that it knows what the end-result is supposed to be.  The article made it sound like it gets a reward system, almost like humans do. Like move arm towards bottle is +1 points, move away, -1, screw left = -1, screw right = +1...But that's just an assumption based on the vague wording of the article. And if it were true, it's very much guided learning, like someone telling you ""yeah! good job!"" and ""no don't do that"" when you're doing something. Like holding it's hand the whole way.

robotics,36r9y8,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Thu May 21 21:17:01 2015 UTC,So when do they finish P-body?
robotics,36uvqo,xiphias10,2,Fri May 22 09:00:19 2015 UTC,Do you guys know good real-world examples which tackle the problematic uses of artificial intelligence?   What problems are there?
robotics,36uvqo,Friendly_Fire,1 point,Fri May 22 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"Mkay your question is worded a little weird but I think I know what you are asking. By ""problematic"" you mean the ethics of replacing a few thousand workers with a few robots I'm assuming.  I will refer you to this article.   https://hbr.org/2014/12/what-happens-to-society-when-robots-replace-workers  So the tldr is we don't know what will happen to us afterwards so it is hard to give an ethical evaluation.  Sure putting 1000 people out of work is bad but if you can reduce the chances that these 1000 people will kill more people in vehicle accidents every year by replacing them with robots where do we stand ethically? These 1000 people will need to find new jobs to support their families and will suffer hardship however they are alive and future folks will not die in crashes because a human was sleepy or drunk. (Im probably breaking a rule somewhere there about future events we can't measure the outcome of but this is all my thought process so nothing here is fact)  Also how do we define our ethics? Pragmatic, religious,cultural?  Each definition gives us a different answer.   If replacing a plane pilot with an advanced AI pilot saves the lives of the passengers onboard because it can react quicker, can diagnose a problem faster with better accuracy, and is not susceptible to high g forces is it better than a pilot who can't do most of these things as efficiently as a computer? Those people don't die because the pilot snapped or fell asleep or made a bad call but the pilot is unemployed.(Assuming perfect world where the robot has been tested fully) chances are most people would want a robot to fly.  Can a robot replace a priest/rabbi? A robot can repeat lines from a book, give interpretations based on specific parameters. (New age church= gays are OK, fundamentalist church= nope) we can program a computer to do what we want, but will it be accepted by the group? Depends, on the church, on the group, personally I would say it wouldnt, most people would want most likely want a personal touch behind the words.  The common thought and tradition to being unemployed is retraining/education  which is most likely out of the question here. (See video and article)   So this seems like a more pressing matter than the ethics of replacing people with robots. Its going to happen, it is happening we just need to find our place in it like those before us.   Sorry for wall of text, complicated question.  Tldr: Currently no, we've only begun replacing humans at grander scales (1000s+) where retraining is not an option so currently its not to big of an issue but it may become one."

robotics,36u19b,i-make-robots,1 point,Fri May 22 08:15:54 2015 UTC,So I guess this is what your gear question was about over on /r/askengineers      Seems like their website is down right now but Igus makes spherical rod ends and plastic bushings of all kinds.
robotics,36u19b,5degreenegativerake,1 point,Fri May 22 17:37:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! And the questions are related, but one about joints and one about gears. I want to know the question about gears to move the joints with one motor, but in different ways."
