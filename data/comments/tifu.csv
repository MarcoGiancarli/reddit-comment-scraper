tifu,3e219m,patentologist,14,Tue Jul 21 17:14:50 2015 UTC,Sweet pic. My GF and I have been trying to find a Pandorus Sphix for a while. We find them alive all the time but we've really wanted one to frame but wont kill it just for that. She finally found a dead one at work this morning and hes in perfect shape. Luckily no bats got to him.
tifu,3e219m,Sharkn91,5,Tue Jul 21 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  There are a lot of really cool ones here, but likewise, I don't want to kill any just for a trophy case.  Really astonishing how similar the color patterns are between your Pandorus and the above Daphnis nerii.  There's another one locally, Daphnis hypothous, that is almost identical to the nerii except for a little white spot on each wing."
tifu,3e219m,patentologist,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah our Pandorus has some pink on the wings but its not nearly as bright and full as the Daphnis. We're not fans of killing them either which is why our collection is still so small. We only find them alive and then just the wings a couple days later. So far we only have the Pandorus, an Imperial, Giant Leopard spotted something or another, and a Harnessed Tiger moth. Also an Hackberry Emperor and a Giant Swallowtail. Were both kind of new to the moth/butterfly identification game and new to collecting. But we did raise three white line sphinx last summer, we released them after they emerged from their cocoons, so they could breed, never found the bodies in the garden though =/  EDIT: a name"

Find out how many moths it takes to successfully fly a knife into an object. Breed them. Teach them how to cut screens, find the weakpoints in homes, and sneak in by the thousands.  Grow your murderous empire. After teaching them to steal from purses and wallets, save up enough and work hard to purchase cheap property (old warehouses) to take your operation a step larger. Once the timing is right, you can dominate neighbors and steal precious artifacts without being held responsible. As the money flows, increase the amount of land you own. Teach them to hide bodies, or dump them in acid so there's no bodies left.   Plague the lands. Become Moth King. Fuck the insect screen."

As a moth farmer, here is what I've had to endure on a weekly basis:  Moths sticking their tongue into my ass crack. Moths defecating on every part of my body. Moths laying eggs in my clothes and hair. Moths dieing while copulating and being trapped, so I get to pull them apart, sex organs fused together.  The worst is getting tongue probed by a moth the size of your hand, so being a slacker with a 70s bush (you don't need ladies to maintain, it's better hygiene to mow the lawn) I am actually disappointed you consider this some kinky moth action. You should feel bad!  :)"

tifu,3e1w5g,PrejudiceZebra,11,Tue Jul 21 16:34:43 2015 UTC,No. Of course not. I'm just saying that it seems weird to me how even though in South Africa we consider it a totally normal way of describing a person when most of the world thinks of it as an offensive word. These kinds of cultural differences are always interesting to me. But you are right. There was still no reason to actually state the race.

Maybe ""mixed"".  Edit: I don't really understand the downvotes. Anyone kind enough to explain?

We went out to eat and the wait (a 40-something year old black guy) brought our food out and said ""Guess who's coming to dinner!"" I just froze when he dropped the food off and my ex asked what was wrong. For those of you who don't know, ""Guess who's coming to dinner"" is the name of a Sidney Poitier movie and about a black man who goes to dinner at his white fiancee's house. So the manager comes out and asks us how the food was. I told him that the food was good but I didn't like what the waiter said. I repeated it and the manager's face dropped. He sent the waiter back to apologize and the waiter said ""I'm sorry, I didn't think you were old enough to know what that was""  Long story short, we got our meal for free and a $100 gift card."

I wanted to say something snarky back but didn't since he was a young guy and didn't mean anything negative by it. But still, it was definitely overly familiar and I don't need random people to observe how diverse my friends are every time I'm out with them."

I guess it wouldn't be a bad thing for for the bartender to say if you were were getting along; on further thought, yes it would.  It would still scream ""CASUAL MULTICULTURALISM IS THE MOST INTERESTING THING ABOUT YOU!""

Where I'm from, it's impolite to say what you think of people unless a) it's an unambiguous compliment, or b) they've indicated that that's how they see themselves.  And since very few compliments are completely unambiguous, it's better not to fuck around with a).  I guess there's also c) It's my business.  Like a waiter can say ""Sir, your voice is very loud"" because it's his job.  Or a hairdresser can say ""Your hair is pretty thick.""  But a waiter shouldn't talk about your hair.  Now a waiter can say ""You look like like you need a drink"" -- a hairdresser cannot.  Now that I spell it out, that's a pretty dumb rule."

I was a little weirded out by it at first, but after a while I mostly got used to it.  I'm somewhat socially anxious, and it kinda helped me come out of my bubble a little bit.

tifu,3e33im,youngthoughts,0,Tue Jul 21 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"I have the memory of a goldfish. I was like ""where have I heard about this $10k ass job before?""  Then I read this.  Thanks for reminding me."
tifu,3e33im,isntaken,16,Wed Jul 22 03:53:06 2015 UTC,"Not that dark really, but i guess it depends on if you are talking like #272727 or #e7e7e7 or any of 48 shades in between. Then it is socially acceptable."
tifu,3e33im,Cheesecake_Delight,13,Tue Jul 21 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"This is not real but to expand on your point:  My boyfriend kept pushing me into doing anal,  he knew early into the relationship I wouldn't do it, he then told the guy housemates I was living with about it, they said I should do it. My boyfriend said it'd be hot and that his last girlfriend liked it, so he doesn't see why I wouldn't. Anyway he broke up with me for his ex and then got her pregnant. Now they have a kid.  Lol if this was in /r/relationships everyone would be all like yeah he shouldn't have done that..."

tifu,3e33im,tomeitsmoar,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:54:40 2015 UTC,"It does happen both ways, a bit but I understand what your saying though, especially with the 'culture' of bragging about it like ""My girlfriend lets me do anal, it's so good. If yours doesn't let you do it, then you should just leave her"" (actually heard that before, though it was just out in public, a guy talking on his phone.)  Exposure of what happens in the bedroom should be a mutual decision (I personally wouldn't agree to it), but it does happen a bit. Seriously, I couldn't imagine wanting to tell my friends that, especially due to it being passed on to that guy/girl who tries to hit on people's partners may think ""oh I want a girl/guy like that"", which is definitely something I wouldn't want to deal with."
tifu,3e33im,Azeemski,-1,Wed Jul 22 04:04:05 2015 UTC,The thing is she didn't force him to do it she was just persistent while still respecting his decision.
tifu,3e33im,box-art,7,Wed Jul 22 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"yeah I'd say the biggest part of the TIFU was sticking with someone who wants to blatantly manipulate your sexuality against your desires. Hey I'm a guy who's into pegging but I still think your dignity that you hold for yourself is worth more than a superficial car... there are  healthy ways to give people incentive to explore new sexual things, but had she truely cared for you she would respect your desire for the vehicle and want you to be happy. TLDR: OP should be more embarrassed about sticking with someone who'd give discomforting ultimatums, not shiny cars."

tifu,3e33im,heretic7622,8,Tue Jul 21 18:03:31 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, if a woman were put into this position it would instantly be called ""prostitution."" If her friends tried to push her into doing it, that would be called ""coercion.""   So in other words, you didn't prostitute yourself for a car. There's nothing wrong with that. Even if ""male pride"" weren't the issue, going from ""never had any sort of anal play AT ALL before"" straight to ""8 inch long, 2 inch thick dong up your ass"" would be super fucking painful.   Even if you are up for trying anal play, there's a time to do it, and that time is not when everyone is pressuring you into doing something you're obviously not cool with doing. If you weren't writing a TIFU about missing an opportunity to get a car right now, you probably would've been writing a TIFU about prostituting your anal virginity away and for feeling betrayed by your girlfriend. It's easy to look back and say ""what if?"" But come on, that situation was manipulative and fucked up."

tifu,3dykz1,SnowmanOlaf,30,Mon Jul 20 19:10:12 2015 UTC,In that case I would say your wife should try to give you the pegging you desire however she is still not required to take it in her own ass if that's not her thing. Could you try some roleplay and pretend your wife is you giving it to her (you) in the ass?

tifu,3dykz1,epicpotato37,31,Mon Jul 20 22:00:54 2015 UTC,"I've never judged her. All I said was that my views on sex differ. She is more vanilla where I am more willing to experiment. I do not personally receive anal sex but I do give it to my wife as she likes it. She was never forced into that decision and I only obliged her after she specifically asked to try it.  I will never think negative about someone over their views (unless they are creationists, holocaust deniers, child molesters etc) because everyone has a right to make their own decisions.  And as far as supposedly making this stuff up, I'll say it again as I've said it before. Sometimes fact is more fantastic than fiction. Just because someone isn't a professional journalist doesn't make their facts any less real.

Apparently the joint account money was mostly his as she paid the majority of the bills. His money was mainly savings and spending money.   I'm pretty sure most states would recognize that cash as a marital asset and therefore the car purchased with it as a marital asset.  It's hard to split a car (unless you cut it in half like that one guy did, yuk yuk) so chances are she'll keep it.  She could have taken the money from his control so that he didn't try to take it all.  I don't see what difference it makes whose paycheck it came from, if it was all from his paycheck because he made twice what she did, she'd still be entitled to half (or more depending on court)."

tifu,3e1dcv,YagoIsMyName,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:24:28 2015 UTC,Depends what sort of boiler you have and how far away it is. For hot water stored in a cylinder close to the shower it's fast. But if it's from a combi boiler some distance away it could take up to a minute to warm up.
tifu,3e1dcv,TangoJulietWhiskey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"Feck no, especially not in winter. Growing up, my shower was on the second floor of a 200 year old house, with water sourced from a well,  in a climate that gets sub-0 F temperatures. I would have literally paid someone if they could  have stood in my shower while it warmed up. And now it's just habit to wait. Plus old houses often have pipes with possibly toxic metals, and since the first thing I do in the shower is finish brushing my teeth & then rinse my mouth, I'm not doing that with water that's been sitting in pipes that have been through both world wars."

The daily max. recommended is 4,000.   6,000mg for a few days in a row isn't horrible but it certainly isn't good especially if OP by chance had any liver function issues.  I think the 5mg/325mg combo is more commonly prescribed now.   Anywhere near 10,000mg or more and it would be a good idea to get to the ER immediately."

There were a few other examples of how out-of-it he was that I don't remember but I did visit him when he was recovering and he was really out of it.  Very tired and just not always making sense.    It is entirely possible he was half-asleep or just woke up from a dream where every channel had cartoons but he was confused or he tried to explain his dream but it came out garbled as if it was really happening but he was too out of it to remember later that the conversation had been about a dream.  I don't recall the story being that he was hallucinating exactly, just that he was talking utter nonsense.  I really don't care enough to argue this, just relayed what I was told because it was a funny story.

tifu,3e03sz,draz93,38,Tue Jul 21 16:10:15 2015 UTC,It's possible but at least they aren't breaking me cold turkey. I did indeed walk out of the doc's office with a refill.
tifu,3e03sz,housebrickstocking,21,Mon Jul 20 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"It's a legitimate concern... I was on Percocet after a major surgery for 3 weeks, and had a mysterious bout of ""flu"" the secind I stopped taking them. My doctor said addiction after just three weeks was impossible, but my body begged to differ.  Not his fault though, doctors were fed a bunch of lies by the drug companies, they know different now but you have to estimate for the conflicting information in all the literature."
tifu,3e03sz,draz93,19,Mon Jul 20 23:17:07 2015 UTC,"Addiction and withdrawal are different.  A hangover is withdrawal from booze, but a hangover does not an alcoholic make."
tifu,3e03sz,housebrickstocking,4,Mon Jul 20 23:42:13 2015 UTC,"A hangover isn't always a withdrawal, just a FYI. This is a common misconception.   True withdrawal is when you're sweating with your heart trying to escape from your chest because the Universe is going to suddenly collapse around you because no human being should be feeling so many emotions. When you keep seeing things move around in the dark, misjudge distances constantly because the sudden decline of alcohol intake shot your depth perception to hell.   Withdrawal is when your body has become accustomed to functioning with a substance in its system, and a hangover is not always necessarily a withdrawal. Your body does not become accustomed to functioning with alcohol in a matter of hours. I've experienced both, and the latter is absolute hell that I would never wish on my worst enemy."
tifu,3e03sz,Dab0rDieTryin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:59 2015 UTC,"As have I. Twice so far through assisted detox - love that in Australia you can get free out patient services with benzos and daily visits from a specialist nurse. Shit mate, I'm in a medically assisted taper right now.   It's the mildest form of withdrawal, but doesn't necessarily indicate dependency. The receptors have been binding to the booze, once the booze is removed what happens? A neurological WD. Simple science behind the addiction, and the treatments."
tifu,3e03sz,djmarrsh,2,Tue Jul 21 09:03:06 2015 UTC,"If you want to get all technical, sure, it is a mild withdrawal. But withdrawals are not ambiguous in the least. They have a specific cause: their bodies don't know how to function without alcohol. A normal person who goes out drinking one night after months of abstaining is going to have a hangover the next day because they poisoned their bodies, not because their bodies need alcohol to function. In fact, with these people, the hair of the dog method does not work for their hangovers, it simply exacerbates the intensity. An alcoholic can alleviate their WD symptoms by drinking some more alcohol, so a withdrawal really is different from a hangover.  I think it's really irresponsible that people have been blurring the distinction between hangovers and withdrawals because it is very important to be able to tell the difference between the two."
tifu,3e03sz,moonbuggy,0,Tue Jul 21 10:11:55 2015 UTC,"I was being technical, but I was also being accurate. There are some really bloody good resources out there describing the gaba / vitamin b / alcohol relationship and it's all on the same curve - just where on that curve is what we are disagreeing on.   Withdrawal doesn't mean dependency is what I've already said, dependency is a point on the curve that is a lot further along than a hangover but the nature of alcohol and gaba receptors made it a great illustration.   You can also go through withdrawal from opiates but not be dependent on them, not addicted but withdrawing. This was my original point and remains accurate."
tifu,3e03sz,metamongoose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am aware that both scenarios are caused by the same pathways in the brain, but they have different causes.   Withdrawals are caused by a sudden decline in your intake of alcohol when hangovers occur because of overindulgence."
tifu,3e03sz,housebrickstocking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:31:21 2015 UTC,"Withdrawal occurs when alcohol leaves your system, and is proportionate to the time and quantity of booze being poured into it.   The resulting WD seriousness is what you're arguing about. Hangover is the /r/drunk big night version, ramp it up over time and you end up with serious acute alcohol WD with real danger of damage to the body, brain, and potentially death.   Yeah you like your personal definition, yes serious acute WD from heavy and long abuse is worse and different than a mild short lived WD - but you don't seem to realise that a binge night big enough can create neurological WD that does exactly the same brain damage..."
tifu,3e03sz,GameofCheese,2,Tue Jul 21 10:38:01 2015 UTC,"The first part is very true in that addiction and withdrawal are different. However, a hangover is not withdrawal from booze. All alcohol you drink contains ethanol which is what gets you drunk. Your liver metabolizes ethanol because it is toxic in large amounts. The metabolization of ethanol produces acetaldehydes in its first step and when combined with dehydration and lack of sleep from drinking heavily it causes a hangover.  Fun fact: This same liver process is the reason why drinking methanol is lethal; methanol is metabolized to formeldahyde (that smelly preservative) which can kill you in very small amounts"
tifu,3e03sz,housebrickstocking,4,Tue Jul 21 10:48:05 2015 UTC,I thought a hangover was dehydration?
tifu,3e03sz,GameofCheese,2,Tue Jul 21 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"Hangover symptoms have been attributed to several causes (see table 2), including the direct physiological effects of alcohol on the brain and other organs; the effects of the removal of alcohol from these organs after alcohol exposure (i.e., withdrawal); the physiological effects of compounds produced as a result of alcohol’s metabolism (i.e., metabolites), especially acetaldehyde; and nonalcohol factors, such as the toxic effects of other biologically active chemicals (i.e., congeners) in the beverage, behaviors associated with the alcohol-drinking bout (e.g., other drug use, restricted food intake, and disruption of normal sleep time), and certain personal characteristics (e.g., temperament, personality, and family history of alcoholism).   http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh22-1/54-60.pdf"

tifu,3e03sz,ThrillBird,5,Tue Jul 21 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"I work in a pharmacy and no one is getting fired for this. I feel bad for you, but as a pharmacy associate as well as working in a Molecular Pathology lab, sometimes the patient needs accountability.   This is a common issue with dating especially in hospitals and by law we have to null&void a poor date on a CII prescription. You did not physically pick it up, so we can't tell your companion how to take it except the doctor order; it violates HIPAA. I've seen addicts, post-surgery patients, and post-accident patients having that strength. The hydrocodone is just gonna make you sleepy; the issue of your ""overdose"" is the acetaminophen. The max daily dose federally is 4.0g. 325x12=3900mg=3.9g. Your insurance was billed for 4 days, so you can just grab another script now if you need it for the pain. Even if it said ""as needed"", it would still be a 4 day supply and would be billed as a 4 day supply. You the patient can extend that depending on usage, but we don't bill according to how you plan on using it.  It is July and in hospitals this is when all 1st year residents start, so there will be a potential for miscommunication, etc. Also a nurse may have typed this and again, some nurses are on their first rotation. Technically, it is hard to say ""malpractice"". The pharmacy followed HIPAA, filled a valid RX which needed 0 confirmation from the MD and is typical for a patient coming from a hospital, and the MD gave a valid order. People on Oxycodone for therapeutic often talk to their MD and they form a game plan on how regularly to take it. Just because they get a 30 day supply, they both made a regiment which will be used as needed even though the script doesn't explicitly state. If this was your first time on Percocet, you should have talked to the MD prior to procedure to understand what to expect. You shouldn't be taking something blindly; this is your body. Understand what is happening to you during and after procedure."

She was totally loopy on it and eventually had to be taken to the hospital as she was stumbling around like she was drunk. Doctor was super apologetic for prescribing the wrong dose but my that was scary.
tifu,3e03sz,jaital32,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"That can be extremely scary. The falling down and short term memory loss can be dangerous on many levels. I'm glad they got it sorted out.  My guy was concerned because of how much I slept and the fact that I would fall asleep sitting up and pretty much in mid-conversation. My life may not have been in danger from the actual taking of the meds but there were potential ramifications that I'm seeing more clearly every day. A slip and fall in the bathroom, or falling asleep in the tub, were potential side effects."

He about died when I told him I took them all the first day  like the bottle told me.

tifu,3e0xad,Daloowee,2,Tue Jul 21 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"I have some martial arts training and a limited legal background. In both arenas, if you can avoid conflict, there's no problem. Physically, and on the street with drunk people, you're probably going to get ganged up on, probably sucker punched, and in more dangerous cities, you may get stabbed or shot. Why risk any of that if you can just avoid it? Legally, some states require you to do a lot to prove that you were acting in self-defense. Florida, Texas, and maybe a few others allow you to hunker down and respond violently if necessary. But with others, it's not always the case. You can still get in trouble for using too much force.  Now, if someone is coming for you, and if you know the fight is unavoidable, then be fucking ruthless and do what you can to survive. But the best advice in most of these things is to avoid it if possible.  Edit: Add to this that there is a gender element (man on woman), and that she may identify as queer or transgender, and you get potential hate crime charges here. Seriously, these circumstances aren't anything to fuck with. In no way, though, does that excuse or justify what she did to provoke the fight. This is just practical advice."

Yet it seems, everybody stopped doing that and instead..... Fuck you if you're not home, no package for you.  We went backwards.

Well, one day the driver got sick and a substitute driver had to drive for a few days. One of the parents on the street decided to call the school/bus company or whatever to see where the bus was. Well, same as you, they did some digging, figured out the driver was deviating from the assigned route and swiftly put a stop to that.

I would go further and say that OP's otherwise gentlemanly comportment is really just a protective measure to avoid the pain that risk taking sometimes entails.   Don't sell yourself short, there are few people who are good enough to be friends, sexually attractive, and especially good in bed. Try to see if it is sustainable. If it is not the  you can accept it like a gentleman and revert to what will inevitably end up as ever more distant friendship.   Stop conditioning your behaviour on what you think she wants. Act upon what you want and if you are lucky, and good for it, she will want the same.  Or just wait and let other people decide your fate through their actions. Not being sarcastic, but that is fine for some people. She may like your selfless personality. In spite of the bad faith, It appears somewhat sweet."

tifu,3dxc3p,TotallyNotWatching,74,Mon Jul 20 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"/r/relationships might be able to help you out.  My two cents:    Now it's Monday, we have barely spoken, and I'm paranoid I've hurt her. I think she feels that I'm going to fall deeply in love with her (which won't happen), and she's scared it will ruin this great friendship....   You need to talk it out with her instead of trying to guess what she feels. She's probably doing the same thing. Neither of you are mind readers.   From your post it sounds like you respected all boundaries and followed her lead both before and after the hookup. All you have to do is continue doing that.   Know what you're interested in/open to, though. If you're amazing friends and the sex was great, are you absolutely sure you wouldn't be up for a relationship? Do you think you'd both be able to navigate fwb without catching feelings? Or do you think it's best for both of you to chalk it up to alcohol and horniness and stay very good friends?   If you'd be open to a relationship, but she only wants to be friends, it sounds like you'll have no problem respecting her wishes. But if she wants a relationship and you want to stay friends, you need to be able to communicate this in a way that she'll understand. Be firm and clear, but leave no doubt in her mind that it wasn't to do with quality of sex. Sexual attraction != romantic attraction != friendship: it's important that you communicate this because otherwise it could sow insecurity about how good she is in bed.   Good luck, OP!"

tifu,3dxc3p,crunchtimestudio,35,Mon Jul 20 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"Umm...I don't kno why you are getting pessimistic comments. This could turn out good too you know? Girls get emotional when they're drunk. And maybe having sex with you was just too much to register on one night. Give it time. But don't just saunter up to her and say, ""don't worry, it was nothing."" Because clearly, there is definitely SOMETHING between you two. Sit down and figure it out. And let her know your feelings about it without the fear of rejection. If you feel it was barely a drunk hookup with piled up attraction from childhood days, tell her exactly that. And she'll process it for herself. And tell her, that you'd do anything to not ruin what's between you guys."

Then we ended up talking, got shitfaced again, and left home. Next morning, we ended up talking again and things were back to normal.  My point here is not to tell you to follow what I did. You really need to talk to her ASAP. But if you do chicken out like we did, then time will eventually heal whatever it is you did to ""scar"" her. Either way, its a win win.

My advice:   If you're interested in her, then dive in head first.  she will reciprocate and is probably saying what she is about the other guy because she doesn't want to put herself too far out there.  she's probably worried you're not in to her and is trying to play it off as ""no big deal"" if doing the above, make damn sure you're ready for a serious long term relationship.  this is the kind of girl you want to marry.  this is the kind of relationship that endures and is fulfilling in more than just the initial ""lustful"" department If you're not ready for something serious, then let things die out casually and do NOT make any Future Limiting Statements.  you will want to capitalize on the chemistry in a few years and this will always stick in her mind.  An example of a FLS is referring to that night as a ""mistake"", constantly reinforcing your ""friendship"", saying how it ""just wouldn't work"", etc. if she makes the ""it just wouldn't work"" statement, that's your cue that she is actually quite interested and is trying to play it off / play it cool.  What she's really saying is: ""tell me i'm wrong and that it would work because we have such great chemistry / friendship.  I've loved you for years, we finally took things further, and now i've ruined our friendship""   Honestly - this girl has probably been in love with you for a long time, but didn't want to ruin the friendship or let it show.  You probably never ""noticed"" her or acted interested in her, so she has always assumed you just weren't that in to her."
tifu,3dxc3p,AnoK760,7,Mon Jul 20 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"I agree....same thing here as well. Best friend for 2 1/2 years. We knew everything about each other and then one night had a drunken fling.  She started acting weird, playing games...I finally told her you either want me or you don't, I'm done.   We've been married 18 years."
tifu,3dxc3p,turrorizer,7,Mon Jul 20 19:01:07 2015 UTC,Did you wear a condom? Maybe that's why she's crying.

tifu,3dxc3p,Kazin7,5,Mon Jul 20 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"Give her a little time, maybe she is just shocked by the whole thing. Maybe tell her you are ready to talk whenever she is, no pressure. Listen to whatever she has to say when she decides to talk to you, she probably will, you've been friends forever now."
tifu,3dxc3p,AllanfromWales,4,Mon Jul 20 09:12:38 2015 UTC,Maybe just maybe all this time her feelings were building and growing and your sexcapade wasn't what she had been hoping and dreaming for.  I think sometimes true feelings come out during drunken moments and she maybe really wanted to be intimate with you but not in that condition and she was regretful.  She wanted it to be 'special' and she may think now the friendship/possibility of more are both no longer options.

tifu,3dxc3p,kv0k,13,Mon Jul 20 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"Girls like this. They like to keep like a group a boys on deck, under their little mind control of ""ooohh she might love me but there is this other dude"" classic type b. This chick is basically and I know she's your friend and I'm sorry but she's a manipulative man stabber. She's just scared to be alone and that's why she slept with you if that other dude was there it would have been him your like a bandaid OP. If you actually want this girl, ignore her. They hate that shit as soon as they lose control of you they want it back and will do anything to get it. Including get into a relationship.

I don't understand why people feel weird about being together if they were childhood friends"
tifu,3dxc3p,fuzzywumpus1,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's not complicated unless you make it that way. Especially knowing everything about the person and as said ""she knows my next move before I do"". I think that right there is hard to find. Someone who knows you as well or better than you know yourself. Sounds like a match to me but to many people see friends, esp childhood friends, as off limits to date. My only thing is I would never want to wonder ""what if"" later down the road. I'd take the chance with someone like that if it was presented. If it doesn't work out in the end, I think you'd be able to be friends. I am still friends with people I have known since I was younger that being in a relationship didn't work out with. It's not as hard as people apparently think."

I feel you need to speak to her in person. Go out for a cup of coffee. Tell her what you feel and find out what she feels about it.  There is a reason why you have been friends for 12 years. If you know someone for that long you do not forget about them. Sure shit did not really do too well for you. You need to get things straight. Who know she may have feelings for someone else for a short period of time. At the end of the day she is going to be with you. She might be you future wife or live-in partner if you are into that.

tifu,3dxc3p,youdontseekyoda,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"No joke - same situation happened here. Best friends for close to 10 years, inseparable and talked all the time. One night she calls because she was out with friends and got left at the bar after she planned on going home with another ""friend"". I get to the bar and shes outside, hammered drunk and alone. We get back to my place, I hand her some PJs and a glass of water and am about to walk out and hit the couch when she pounces on me and just starts doing her thing. Mind you there has always been chemistry and the tension has been always been there, so I don't stop her. Fast forward about 3 months and things are still going great. We weren't necessarily ""f**k buddies"" but we didn't hold back when we were together either. One night we go out to watch a UFC fight and all is well, we go back to my place and partake in adult activities... the next morning she acted more awkward than a Trekkie at a Star Wars convention. I asked what was wrong and couldn't get a straight answer. I took her home, she said she thought it was best if we didn't speak for a while and that she needed space.  Long story short, we quit talking cold turkey and didn't speak for about 5 years... one day I decided to ask what happened and she said that she didn't want me to chase her, but that she wanted to know that I valued our friendship more than the sex. That had I made an attempt to talk through things, she knows it would have been close to perfect for us. She is now in a happy relationship and I am happy for her, but damn does it suck to know I lost my best friend and an awesome ""GF""....  TL;DR - Don't make my mistake. If you really care about her, don't let her get away. Stay friends or whatever you want to call it, but don't lose her. Even if she is stubborn about it - don't let it ruin the friendship."

I would go further and say that OP's otherwise gentlemanly comportment is really just a protective measure to avoid the pain that risk taking sometimes entails.   Don't sell yourself short, there are few people who are good enough to be friends, sexually attractive, and especially good in bed. Try to see if it is sustainable. If it is not the  you can accept it like a gentleman and revert to what will inevitably end up as ever more distant friendship.   Stop conditioning your behaviour on what you think she wants. Act upon what you want and if you are lucky, and good for it, she will want the same.  Or just wait and let other people decide your fate through their actions. Not being sarcastic, but that is fine for some people. She may like your selfless personality. In spite of the bad faith, It appears somewhat sweet."

tifu,3dxc3p,TotallyNotWatching,74,Mon Jul 20 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"/r/relationships might be able to help you out.  My two cents:    Now it's Monday, we have barely spoken, and I'm paranoid I've hurt her. I think she feels that I'm going to fall deeply in love with her (which won't happen), and she's scared it will ruin this great friendship....   You need to talk it out with her instead of trying to guess what she feels. She's probably doing the same thing. Neither of you are mind readers.   From your post it sounds like you respected all boundaries and followed her lead both before and after the hookup. All you have to do is continue doing that.   Know what you're interested in/open to, though. If you're amazing friends and the sex was great, are you absolutely sure you wouldn't be up for a relationship? Do you think you'd both be able to navigate fwb without catching feelings? Or do you think it's best for both of you to chalk it up to alcohol and horniness and stay very good friends?   If you'd be open to a relationship, but she only wants to be friends, it sounds like you'll have no problem respecting her wishes. But if she wants a relationship and you want to stay friends, you need to be able to communicate this in a way that she'll understand. Be firm and clear, but leave no doubt in her mind that it wasn't to do with quality of sex. Sexual attraction != romantic attraction != friendship: it's important that you communicate this because otherwise it could sow insecurity about how good she is in bed.   Good luck, OP!"

tifu,3dxc3p,crunchtimestudio,35,Mon Jul 20 16:27:46 2015 UTC,"Umm...I don't kno why you are getting pessimistic comments. This could turn out good too you know? Girls get emotional when they're drunk. And maybe having sex with you was just too much to register on one night. Give it time. But don't just saunter up to her and say, ""don't worry, it was nothing."" Because clearly, there is definitely SOMETHING between you two. Sit down and figure it out. And let her know your feelings about it without the fear of rejection. If you feel it was barely a drunk hookup with piled up attraction from childhood days, tell her exactly that. And she'll process it for herself. And tell her, that you'd do anything to not ruin what's between you guys."

We then happened to be present at the same party. We avoided making eye contact but at the end, a common friend made us meet. He had no idea what had transpired. Then we ended up talking, got shitfaced again, and left home. Next morning, we ended up talking again and things were back to normal.  My point here is not to tell you to follow what I did. You really need to talk to her ASAP. But if you do chicken out like we did, then time will eventually heal whatever it is you did to ""scar"" her. Either way, its a win win. I would advise you go and talk to her."

My ""best friend i accidentally hooked up with"" is now my wife of 5 years and mother to my two children.  BEST.  DECISION.  EVER.  The fact that she's ""glad it happened"" is your cue.    My advice:   If you're interested in her, then dive in head first.  she will reciprocate and is probably saying what she is about the other guy because she doesn't want to put herself too far out there.  she's probably worried you're not in to her and is trying to play it off as ""no big deal"" if doing the above, make damn sure you're ready for a serious long term relationship.  this is the kind of girl you want to marry.  this is the kind of relationship that endures and is fulfilling in more than just the initial ""lustful"" department If you're not ready for something serious, then let things die out casually and do NOT make any Future Limiting Statements.  you will want to capitalize on the chemistry in a few years and this will always stick in her mind.  An example of a FLS is referring to that night as a ""mistake"", constantly reinforcing your ""friendship"", saying how it ""just wouldn't work"", etc. if she makes the ""it just wouldn't work"" statement, that's your cue that she is actually quite interested and is trying to play it off / play it cool.  What she's really saying is: ""tell me i'm wrong and that it would work because we have such great chemistry / friendship.  I've loved you for years, we finally took things further, and now i've ruined our friendship""   Honestly - this girl has probably been in love with you for a long time, but didn't want to ruin the friendship or let it show.  You probably never ""noticed"" her or acted interested in her, so she has always assumed you just weren't that in to her."
tifu,3dxc3p,AnoK760,7,Mon Jul 20 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"I agree....same thing here as well. Best friend for 2 1/2 years. We knew everything about each other and then one night had a drunken fling.  She started acting weird, playing games...I finally told her you either want me or you don't, I'm done.   We've been married 18 years."
tifu,3dxc3p,turrorizer,7,Mon Jul 20 19:01:07 2015 UTC,Did you wear a condom? Maybe that's why she's crying.
tifu,3dxc3p,Kazin7,8,Mon Jul 20 11:34:03 2015 UTC,You didn't do anything wrong bro. She wanted it just as much as you did. Don't feel bad about her decisions. She is a grown ass adult and so are you
tifu,3dxc3p,Kazin7,5,Mon Jul 20 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"Give her a little time, maybe she is just shocked by the whole thing. Maybe tell her you are ready to talk whenever she is, no pressure. Listen to whatever she has to say when she decides to talk to you, she probably will, you've been friends forever now."
tifu,3dxc3p,AllanfromWales,4,Mon Jul 20 09:12:38 2015 UTC,Maybe just maybe all this time her feelings were building and growing and your sexcapade wasn't what she had been hoping and dreaming for.  I think sometimes true feelings come out during drunken moments and she maybe really wanted to be intimate with you but not in that condition and she was regretful.  She wanted it to be 'special' and she may think now the friendship/possibility of more are both no longer options.

tifu,3dxc3p,kv0k,13,Mon Jul 20 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"Girls like this. They like to keep like a group a boys on deck, under their little mind control of ""ooohh she might love me but there is this other dude"" classic type b. This chick is basically and I know she's your friend and I'm sorry but she's a manipulative man stabber. She's just scared to be alone and that's why she slept with you if that other dude was there it would have been him your like a bandaid OP. If you actually want this girl, ignore her. They hate that shit as soon as they lose control of you they want it back and will do anything to get it. Including get into a relationship. Although I warn against that to because the entire manipulative controlling aspect of her personality will ruin that for you."
tifu,3dxc3p,hohohoohno,11,Mon Jul 20 18:33:28 2015 UTC,You're so accurate it's unreal. She kind of admitted to me that she knows she can just click her fingers and get me whenever she wants. OP needs to grow a pair and stop that.

""oh we've been friend since we were young it's weird""....umm actually that's perfect, and even better than just meeting someone later on. I don't understand why people feel weird about being together if they were childhood friends"
tifu,3dxc3p,fuzzywumpus1,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's not complicated unless you make it that way. Especially knowing everything about the person and as said ""she knows my next move before I do"". I think that right there is hard to find. Someone who knows you as well or better than you know yourself. Sounds like a match to me but to many people see friends, esp childhood friends, as off limits to date. My only thing is I would never want to wonder ""what if"" later down the road. I'd take the chance with someone like that if it was presented. If it doesn't work out in the end, I think you'd be able to be friends. I am still friends with people I have known since I was younger that being in a relationship didn't work out with. It's not as hard as people apparently think."

I feel you need to speak to her in person. Go out for a cup of coffee. Tell her what you feel and find out what she feels about it.  There is a reason why you have been friends for 12 years. If you know someone for that long you do not forget about them. Sure shit did not really do too well for you. You need to get things straight. Who know she may have feelings for someone else for a short period of time. At the end of the day she is going to be with you. She might be you future wife or live-in partner if you are into that.

tifu,3dxc3p,youdontseekyoda,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"No joke - same situation happened here. Best friends for close to 10 years, inseparable and talked all the time. One night she calls because she was out with friends and got left at the bar after she planned on going home with another ""friend"". I get to the bar and shes outside, hammered drunk and alone. We get back to my place, I hand her some PJs and a glass of water and am about to walk out and hit the couch when she pounces on me and just starts doing her thing. Mind you there has always been chemistry and the tension has been always been there, so I don't stop her. Fast forward about 3 months and things are still going great. We weren't necessarily ""f**k buddies"" but we didn't hold back when we were together either. One night we go out to watch a UFC fight and all is well, we go back to my place and partake in adult activities... the next morning she acted more awkward than a Trekkie at a Star Wars convention. I asked what was wrong and couldn't get a straight answer. I took her home, she said she thought it was best if we didn't speak for a while and that she needed space.  Long story short, we quit talking cold turkey and didn't speak for about 5 years... one day I decided to ask what happened and she said that she didn't want me to chase her, but that she wanted to know that I valued our friendship more than the sex. That had I made an attempt to talk through things, she knows it would have been close to perfect for us. She is now in a happy relationship and I am happy for her, but damn does it suck to know I lost my best friend and an awesome ""GF""....  TL;DR - Don't make my mistake. If you really care about her, don't let her get away. Stay friends or whatever you want to call it, but don't lose her. Even if she is stubborn about it - don't let it ruin the friendship."

Don't worry about it, if you're still cool with each other, mix it up when you can because it's fun, you're  young and adults. It doesn't have to be weird if you don't make it that weird.

tifu,3e3nhs,hantucc,5,Tue Jul 21 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"Hey man, it sounds like you are having a really tough time, and I'm sorry to hear that. From what you have written it sounds like you have a strong grasp already with what has been going on in your life and why that is... Playing games are great, I love games, but they can becoming addicting and can cause you to lose sleep, lose a job,  fail school, or neglect the ones you love... My advise as a stranger, try cutting back time from games and do other things instead. Breakups suck, and the last thing you want to do is go outside and do things, but that's what can really help you right now. Sitting in a room, playing games, and dwelling on the memories of the past is not the best way to move on.  Also, right now, this girl you spent so much of your time with, you may have thought she was The One and no one will ever be as good as her. You need to accept that that is not true and that you are only 21 years old. You are going to meet so many incredible people in your life, and this girl is not going to compare to the great memories you will make in the future.  Here is something I found on reddit that has helped me with grief. This original post was about getting over someone who has died, but it can be connected to a break up as well, as the feelings are similar...   As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.  In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.  Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."

A lot of it depends on the dynamics of your friendship. Still... here's my two cents.  If you are as good friends with her as it appears (After all, she freakin' let you touch her boobs, man...girls don't do that unless they are pretty damn comfortable with you), then I would suggest talking to her. As gently as possible. Maybe say that you like her alot (I'm assuming you do?) but you're not sure that you're ready for a full-on, 100% committed relationship. Tell her you value her friendship highly, you love her as a friend, and you obviously don't want that to stop... maybe that you're just wanting to see how things go with no strings yet?   Again, please don't take this as though I'm some kind of expert...my advice might be 100% off base, just my honest thoughts."

Well,  not entirely. Earlier today I told the tech administering the MRI for my lower back the he was an idiot and then waited for twenty minutes to speak with his supervisor about the utter fucking ineptitude of Simonmed's employees. This douche canoe wouldn't take ten seconds to warn me about the table raising up six feet off the ground once I was positioned inside the resonance chamber, how jarring the noises the machine makes really are, or how long it would take.   First off, I'm getting the MRI for what is likely an injury to my sciatica, the prominent nerve cluster that runs from the sacrum down the buttocks, legs, and feet. I'm in a ton of pain and refuse to take the prescribed opiates for relief.  I've delt with what was likely only minor withdrawl symptoms in the past after two weeks of Percocets from a near botched removal of my wisdom teeth. I say minor because I actually took them as prescribed and still felt shaky and nauseous for a good four days after. So this time I say fuck that noise and stick it out with only Ibuprofen, ice, and heat. The pain is getting worse and I have excellent health insurance so I decide to get MRI in hopes a  good doctor can refer me to physical therapy. When I walk into the medical office where the procedure is done on site I see a packed waiting room. Half the people in there look like they're dying of cancer,  some of them probably are.   I sign in and find a seat between two people that look sedated and wait my turn.  Forty five minutes later I'm called back by a technician running the test. The guy is a short fat fuck sporting a thatch of greasy curly hair awkwardly combed over obvious balding. He asks me if I have anything metal on me. I say no and he asks, ""Are you sure? No cell phone, no piercings, not even a belt?"" I shake my head.  I left everything metallic locked in my car like I was supposed too. He asks me again. ""Are you sure? No metal screws or pins from previous surgeries?"" I shake my head again and he frowns like I just threw a fart at his face. Then he asks me to follow him down a hallway until we get to the room where the machine is kept. Once inside Greasetwatburger Guy hands me a pair of earplugs and tells me to lay down on the table. I put the earplugs in and do as I'm instructed. The table pulls me inside the machine and I wait, wondering how it all works. Thirty seconds later I hear a very loud knocking sound followed by what sounds like a fucking fire alarm going off. It's loud even with earbuds wedged in deep.  After ten or so seconds the pitch of the noise shifts to a more of a whirling buzz with staccato bursts of electrical sizzles, still loud as hell but not nearly as startling as the first alarm tones. Its like a soundboard on set for Frakenstein's reanimation. After fifteen minutes (felt like 30) I hear  an evenly staggered group of less annoying chirps and feel the table I'm laying on retract from inside the giant magnetic doughnut hole. I swing my legs over the side of the table, more than ready to get the hell out of there. Problem is when I first sat on the table to lay down it was about three to four feet off the ground. I didn't realize the whole device raised up like six feet off the ground while it was being operated. So I think I'm good to go and hop down and the extra three foot drop gets the better of me and my injured back and down I go into a puddle of pain on the floor. Then Dipshit comes running in the room and instead of helping me up he starts YELLING that I was supposed to wait for him before getting down.  So here's the deal. I'm 6 foot 4 inches tall at 260 pounds. I'm in pretty good shape aside from my back and this little Fucktard in still yelling at me as I struggle to get to my feet.    Okay, quick pause.  People make mistakes. This guy should've warned me first about the noise, length of test,  and elevated table but didn't. I should looked down before getting off the table, though to be fair I have horrible eyesight and had to leave my glasses outside the room in a patient locker. A few years ago I would've probably kept  this asswad in a chokehold a few seconds past his body going limp,  but I'm getting much better with my temper after seriously limited my alcohol intake. I finally get to my feet and walk past the technician still screaming at me. I limp down the hallway until I get to the waiting area and ask for the manager who happens to be on break. When she returns from lunch I repeat what happened in colorful language. She tells me to watch my mouth and I tell her to fuck herself while pounding sand. End of true story. TIFU by trusting a weasly ass clown to inform me of what the fuck happens when getting an MRI."

tifu,3dy60b,thebirddoctor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:02 2015 UTC,Feel like elaborating? I don't know much about formal philosophy
tifu,3dy60b,charlzandre,3,Mon Jul 20 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"Ethics.  Basically, (and I'm sure someone who has more training in this than I do will correct me) Kant says that one should never do anything that he or she wouldn't want everyone else to always do. This is called the categorical imperative. This means that one should never lie, even if it appears to be for good reasons, because lying is inherently immoral.  The utilitarian says that the ""right"" or moral act is the one that increases the amount of happiness in the world, even if a Kantian would consider the act immoral (e.g. lying).  Edit: So, someone who says that OP was right by not correcting himself is taking the utilitarian approach because his lie made the barber happy and no one was hurt by the lie, thus it was the moral act. The commenters (edit: /u/Snake7744 & /u/MARZalmighty) who said that OP should have corrected himself because he lied and lying is wrong are adhering to Kantian ethics."
tifu,3dy60b,thebirddoctor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"Well, considering OP stated they live in a very small town, he is very likely to encounter the barber again. Does he continue the lie or is he foiled? Either way, happiness is last on one end or the other. Unless of course, OP has no moral misgivings to carrying on the lie."
tifu,3dy60b,MARZalmighty,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:25 2015 UTC,I'm not arguing whether you are right or wrong. I was just trying to demonstrate how you two commenters could be convinced you're right when everyone else seems to think you're wrong.

I wanted to browse facebook or something like that and so when they weren't home I went in their room and started rummaging through the socks, only to accidentally grab a vibrator instead of my phone. My phone was right beside it though. My mom would ground me and put my phone right next to her sex toy. Scarred for life."

My 8 year old cousin has probably seen it but if that wasn't the case I would save him some eyebleach and tossed the dildo in the back of the top shelf then arranged rows shampoo in front of it to shield the awful device. I have found a dildo in my mom's sock thingies and a vibrating finger toy. I wasn't very shocked because who doesn't fucking masterbate. My dad has a stash of DVD's and cheap Viagra in one of my old birthday bags, my brother has anal lube sitting at the bottom of his night table and a sex game thingy in a small red box.

Having ridden horses and taken care of dogs I have some advice:  NEVER wrap a leash/rope etc. around your arm or wrist.  If something larger and heavier then you wants to go it will go and you will go with it.  Strong dogs can do a good amount of damage too.

If I was a new intern you bet your ass I'm doing everything to stay in good graces with my boss and the company.   If my supervisor told me I could leave early I would let him know I was fine sticking it out till the end. That would probably score me major brownie points.   Yes you told him he COULD leave. But he made the choice to actually go instead of making a good impression and paying his dues.

What kind of candy ass world do you live in?  In general it's a valuable lesson about not chumping out at the 5 yard line, if you're in for a penny you might as well be in for a pound.  More to the point though, part of being new is being hazed.  A reasonable amount of hazing helps destroy preconceived notions of how something should work and force you to understand how it actually works.  It also helps with social bonding, you become part of the group through the shared experience of getting trolled by the existing group members who already went through it.  Nothing bonds people like shared suffering.  TL;DR  -  Who's got two thumbs and had a flash bang tossed into his room in the middle of the night on day one of military school?  this guy"

tifu,3dx96y,palopolo,4,Mon Jul 20 16:31:00 2015 UTC,Not everyone is slave to the unions or works a government job.  The private sector can do/pay whomever/whatever they want to not show up.
tifu,3dx96y,cookdd,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:04 2015 UTC,"In Europe the unions are not enslaving anyone, actually collective negotiation is the way to obtain bigger benefits than individually and have protection. They exist in the private sector, it's not compulsory belonging to them, and in some countries you can't benefit from collective negotiation if you don't belong to one of the negotiating unions.  I've always worked in the private sector, in 3 different EU countries, for 9 different companies to date, and I've never seen any company pay more just because, or give away free holiday. Any bonus has to be explicitly accepted by the employee (due to the increase in taxation). If you don't work, you don't produce, however the company exists to make money, therefore my doubts about something I've never witnessed in my career.  In other places it might be different, though."

tifu,3dx96y,palopolo,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:17 2015 UTC,I understand.  There have actually been articles about several companies in the U.S. giving employees paid time off or forcing them to take their vacation time because they believe it increases productivity in the long run and if quality of life is better then the employees are more loyal to the company.
tifu,3dx96y,cookdd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:51 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, in the US you don't normally have paid vacation, that would be understandable.

tifu,3dw5b3,TheRufmeisterGeneral,24,Tue Jul 21 02:31:14 2015 UTC,Americans haven't quite figured out how to casually ride a bicycle as an adult. Just to go from your house to work requires grown men to dress up in padded spandex like they are racing in the Tour de France and mount a $3000 bike just to travel a few miles. I'm hoping once our bike infrastructure improves this will help tone everything down a notch.

I just want to buy massive quantities of caffeine and neighbors be trying to commit suicide by housewife and shit.
tifu,3dw5b3,m0llywobbles,3,Tue Jul 21 12:29:13 2015 UTC,Why exactly?
tifu,3dw5b3,Patientchair,13,Tue Jul 21 08:29:25 2015 UTC,"Because bicycles here are such common machines that millions of Dutchmen use everyday. But they're not high-tech and tweaked machines. Maybe if we're annoyed enough, we'll yank the saddle to make it a tad straighter, but otherwise, any Dutchman will be able to use any bike without complaining, assuming the legs are long enough to reach the pedals and it's not broken.  My last few bikes have cost less than $50 each, second-hand and old.  I've biked tons of miles and never used bike shorts. I've spent more time on a bike while wearing a suit than I have in bike shorts.  So, these comments of people carefully discussing how to best adjust a bike for the very rare and occasional single ride are funny to me. :)  It's like coffee. I love coffee. And I drink it a lot. And like sleeping in a bed, I particularly like the coffee at my own home, but I'm not fussy. If I visit a client, I'll get offered their coffee, and I'll be happy I have coffee. If I'm at the supermarket, I'll grab a cup of coffee there while shopping, and I'll be happy I have coffee (free coffee is common at Dutch supermarkets). My parents have a Nespresso that is not my favourite, but when I'm there, I'll drink it just fine and I'll be happy to have coffee. Most days, I'll have about half a dozen to a dozen cups a day.  And then, I see somebody who goes to Starbucks in the morning to get a (one) moccha-soy-latta-whatever, to very specific specifications and then only has that one coffee until the end of business day.  That is hilarious to me as well. That is not somebody who likes or knows coffee, that is just someone who prefers a very specific type of candy drink in the morning, and the atmosphere of Starbucks. Which is fine, but it's so completely different from me and my love for coffee.  Similarly with bicycles. I'm an expert on them. I can take any bike and ride it comfortably, and I have with many in the past. I have tons of experience with them. I'm not fussy. I like bikes in general, as do most Dutch.  But what the people above me are describing is something different. It's not a functional relationship with bicycles, it's a hobby, of fussing over details, of tweaking them, of looking sporty when doing it.  Which, again, is fine, but it's funny to see from the perspective of someone from a culture where they are simple tools that everybody simply has, and where they're often broken and stolen (and thus: having expensive, shiny, fancy ones isn't helpful at all).  Sorry for the long rant. Did I mention I like coffee?"
tifu,3dw5b3,TheRufmeisterGeneral,3,Tue Jul 21 10:07:03 2015 UTC,Lol! Thanks that definitely answered it. I've recently moved to Oregon and need to bike a lot of places and it always makes me laugh to see how extreme people are with bikes.

Living downtown sucks, i could be able to cycle at night no problem, but after 4-5 hours of training i really don't want to go around cycling. I'm thinking about cycling to work, its about a 40km round trip, so it'd be a decent distance. The thing is, i sweat like a mother fucker, and we can't shower at work."
tifu,3dw5b3,Conquerz,17,Mon Jul 20 13:15:53 2015 UTC,"Downtown areas are the best places for cycling though.

tifu,3dw5b3,Conquerz,13,Mon Jul 20 14:27:33 2015 UTC,"If you live in a downtown area though, you really should consider cycling for getting around. It's extremely practical.

Plus, more people biking on streets encourages cities to invest in protected bike lanes and cycle tracks, thereby making it safer and encouraging more people to bike for transportation."

But my work is 19.5km away from my place, and only 4kms have bike lines, the side of the highway doesn't have any bike lines, and the highway clearly doesnt either. And basically the only way to go to my workplace is by going in the highway, which is PACKED with cars.  I'm really considering using the side of highway, but i'd need to get somewhere to change clothes and take a quick bath before I go to work, and i'd need to wake up an hour earlier because i'm used to wake up at 8am to get to work at 9am, going with my motorcycle is pretty fast."
tifu,3dw5b3,Conquerz,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"The problem with biking is it's very slow.  At least with my terrible fitness.

Used once at lunch hour class in December 2009. Usage timeline as follows:  11:45a Register for hot yoga class. Infinite wisdom tells me to commit to 5 class package and purchase a yoga mat. I pay $89.74. Money well spent, I smugly confirm to myself.  11:55a Open door to yoga room. A gush of hot dry air rushes through and past me. It smells of breath, sweat and hot. Take spot on floor in back of room next to cute blonde. We will date.  11:57a I feel the need to be as near to naked as possible. This is a problem because of the hot blonde to my left and our pending courtship. She will not be pleased to learn that I need to lose 30 pounds before I propose to her.  11:58a The shirt and sweats have to come off. I throw caution to the wind and decide to rely on my wit and conditioning to overcome any weight issues my fiance may take issue with. This will take a lot of wit and conditioning.  11:59a Begin small talk with my bride to be. She pretends to ignore me but I know how she can be. I allow her to concentrate and stare straight ahead and continue to pretend that I don't exist. As we finish sharing our special moment, I am suddenly aware of a sweat moustache that has formed below my nose. This must be from the all the whispering between us.  12:00p Instructor enters the room and ascends her special podium at the front of the room. She is a slight, agitated Chinese woman. She introduces me to the class and everyone turns around to greet me just as I decide to aggressively adjust my penis and testes packed in my Under Armor. My bride is notably unfazed.  12:02p Since I do have experience with Hot Yoga (4 sessions just 5 short years ago) I fully consider that I may be so outstanding and skilled that my instructor may call me out and ask me to guide the class. My wife will look on with a sparkle in her eye. We will make love after class.  12:10p It is now up to 95 degrees in the room. We have been practicing deep breathing exercises for the last 8 minutes. This would not be a problem if we were all breathing actual, you know, oxygen. Instead, we are breathing each other's body odor, expelled carbon dioxide and other unmentionables. (Don't worry, I'll mention them later.)  12:26p It is now 100 degrees and I take notice of the humidity, which is hovering at about 90%. I feel the familiar adorning stare of my bride and decide to look back at her. She appears to be nauseated. I then realize that I forgot to brush my teeth prior to attending this class. We bond.  12:33p It is now 110 degrees and 95% humidity. I am now balancing on one leg with the other leg crossed over the other. My arms are intertwined and I am squatting. The last time I was in this position was 44 years ago in the womb, but I'm in this for the long haul. My wife looks slightly weathered dripping sweat and her eyeliner is streaming down her face. Well, ""for better or worse"" is what we committed to so we press on.  12:40p The overweight Hispanic man two spots over has sweat running down his legs. At least I think its sweat. He is holding every position and has not had a sip of water since we walked in. He is making me look bad and I hate him.  12:44p I consider that if anyone in this room farted that we would all certainly perish.  12:52p It is now 140 degrees and 100% humidity. I am covered from head to toe in sweat. There is not a square millimeter on my body that is not slippery and sweaty. I am so slimy that I feel like a sea lion or a maybe sea eel. Not even a bear trap could hold me. The sweat is stinging my eyeballs and I can no longer see.  12:55p This room stinks of asparagus, cloves, tuna and tacos. There is no food in the room. I realize that this is an amalgamation of the body odors of 30 people in a 140 degree room for the last 55 minutes. Seriously, enough with the asparagus, ok?  1:01p 140 degrees and 130% humidity. Look, bitch, I need my space here so don't get all pissy with me if I accidentally sprayed you with sweat as I flipped over. Seriously, is that where this relationship is going? Get over yourself. We need counseling and she needs to be medicated. Stat!  1:09p 150 degrees and cloudy. And hot. I can no longer move my limbs on my own. I have given up on attempting any of the commands this Chinese chick is yelling out at us. I will lay sedentary until the aid unit arrives. I will buy this building and then have it destroyed. I lose consciousness.  1:15p I have a headache and my wife is being a selfish bitch. I can't really breathe. All I can think about is holding a cup worth of hot sand in my mouth. I cannot remember what an ice cube is and cannot remember what snow looks like. I consider that my only escape might be a crab walk across 15 bodies and then out of the room. I am paralyzed, and may never walk again so the whole crab walk thing is pretty much out.  1:17p I cannot move at all and cannot reach my water. Is breathing voluntary or involuntary? If it's voluntary, I am screwed. I stopped participating in the class 20 minutes ago. Hey, lady! I paid for this frickin class, ok?! You work for me! Stop yelling at everyone and just tell us a story or something. It's like juice and cracker time, ok?  1:20p It is now 165 degrees and moisture is dripping from the ceiling. The towel that I am laying on is no longer providing any wicking or drying properties. It is actually placing additional sweat on me as I touch it. My towel reeks. I cannot identify the smell but no way can it be from me. Did someone spray some stank on my towel or something?  1:30p Torture session is over. I wish hateful things upon the instructor. She graciously allows us to stay and 'cool down' in the room. It is 175 degrees. Who cools down in 175 degrees? A Komodo Dragon? My wife has left the room. Probably to throw up.  1:34p My opportunity to escape has arrived. I roll over to my stomach and press up to my knees. It is warmer as I rise up from ground level - probably by 15 degrees. So let's conservatively say it's 190. I muster my final energy and slowly rise. One foot in front of the other. One foot in front of the other. Towards the door. Towards the door.  1:37p The temperature in the lobby is 72 degrees. Both nipples stiffen to diamond strength and my penis begins to retract into my abdomen from the 100 degree temp swing. I can once again breathe though so I am pleased. I spot my future ex wife in the lobby. We had such a good thing going but I know that no measure of counseling will be able to unravel the day's turmoil and mental scaring.  1:47p Arrive at Emerald City Smoothie and proceed to order a 32 oz beverage. 402 calories, 0 fat and 14 grams of protein -- effectively negating any caloric burn or benefit from the last 90 minutes. I finish it in 3 minutes and spend the next 2 hours writing this memoir.  3:47p Create Craigslist ad while burning final 2 grams of protein from Smoothie and before the ""shakes"" consume my body.  4:29p Note to self - check car for missing wet yoga towel in am."

And listen to the instructor when they tell you to pull back to an easier pose if you're struggling.  They know what they're talking about, and you really don't want to spend the next five days in miserable pain.  It took me MONTHS of ""gentle yoga"" before I attempted anything beyond a beginner level class.  Now I can hold my own in a room full of super-bendy college kids.    At the rate I'm going, in another 15 years I'll be able to collect Social Security AND get into marichyasana."

They do it because it's a good neutral but active pose. It is a much better choice than a strain, sprain, or just being miserable.   Beginners classes are great, and a good place to learn that there is no ""winning"" in yoga; it's just something to do for you. Everybody's body is different and likely to need some modifications to make poses safe for them, and if you try to progress to more complicated poses without knowing what parts of your body are likely to need modifications, you can get into some trouble.   Balance poses are my nemesis. Weird back issues mean that I have tightness is new, exciting places most days, making it a new and slightly annoying process.

What you're doing is making yourself healthier, reducing your stress, and with a lifetime commitment, making sure you won't be walking into Walgreens like you have a hump on your back when you're 70.   I was told repeatedly by instructors to stop trying so hard. WHAT? Does not compute.   The transition was as much mental as physical, and when I started to ""get"" it, I effortlessly made big improvements."

tifu,3dw5b3,evoblade,15,Mon Jul 20 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you how many guys laugh at me when I tell them I do yoga, and invite them to a class. The laughter ends pretty quickly that first class.   Agree completely. Seeing all these soccer moms in their yoga pants, quite a perk, I'm thinking, ""Screw yoga, I'll own yoga.""  I like lifting weights, but and for my meathead buddies who get on me for going with yoga instead of iron, I just remind them they're looking at guys in tank tops and sweatpants, because they only do arms and chest, sweating and staring at themselves in the mirror. In yoga, I see yoga pants. Yoga pants everywhere."
tifu,3dw5b3,ambitious_flosser,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:22 2015 UTC,This is an often overlooked part of yoga or other female-dominated pursuits (eg. dance lessons). Crossfit tends to have a much higher percent female attendance than a regular gym.

tifu,3dw5b3,ambitious_flosser,10,Mon Jul 20 17:42:36 2015 UTC,My sister's ballet teacher had two sons.  These boys danced from about the time they could walk.  They were very strong and constantly around athletic girls.  Both pulled down some serious tail in high school.

Being the alternative guy kind of guy I was, I signed up for yoga.  I had no idea it was a girl thing.  I figured I'd be turning myself into a pretzel by the end of the semester.  At the first class it was clear that this was not to be.  It was 29 eighteen year-old girls and me.  I was surrounded by girls twisting and stretching.  I have to admit that about halfway through class I realized that this was a much better choice than football or weightlifting."

tifu,3dw5b3,frontpagemobile,15,Mon Jul 20 04:57:45 2015 UTC,"Man, as a guy who's done yoga regularly, you not only summed it up as someone who doesn't get into all the spiritual stuff, but also how painful and confusing it is to a newbie. This should be published in a magazine for guys afraid to do yoga. This is EXACTLY how I felt the first few times.   As tough as it is sometimes, there's something about a nice butt in yoga pants staring back at you to get your mind off of the pain.   That was beautiful.   Yoga is awesome, and it does get better. Give it a month and you'll really start feeling the difference."
tifu,3dw5b3,ambitious_flosser,3,Mon Jul 20 17:01:23 2015 UTC,Were you one of the only guys there? Did you know anyone else?  Seems like it potentially would be extremely awkward and socially uncomfortable.
tifu,3dw5b3,chaosmosis,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:49 2015 UTC,"As a girl that regularly goes to yoga classes, it's really not awkward at all (at least, not for me as a girl when there are guy(s) there). It's kind of like going to a naked figure drawing class, or going to the gym. Sure, there are hot bodies around, but you're there for a purpose and once you get to business no one is looking at anyone else. As you can tell from this entire thread, yoga is strenuous--people talk about checking girls out but really it's a workout and you're just not thinking about that."
tifu,3dw5b3,hayberry,2,Tue Jul 21 08:43:13 2015 UTC,I am often the only male in yoga classes. I don't find it the least bit awkward or uncomfortable.  Everyone there is focused on themself (which is kind of the point) and isn't interested in what you're doing.  Most instructors seem to really like first timers.  And they're REALLY happy if you come back to their class.  Lets them know they're doing something right.
tifu,3dw5b3,m32780,28,Tue Jul 21 12:45:28 2015 UTC,Best description on going to yoga ever. I haven't been dragged to yoga by my girlfriend but Not for lack of her begging.  I did get dragged to a 1 hour yoga meditation thing where you sit on a pillow and drink green tea then contemplate reality for an hour. I woke up when my girlfriend smacked hard. Apparently sleeping is looked down on there.
tifu,3dw5b3,AngryBeard87,34,Mon Jul 20 06:24:10 2015 UTC,To be fair the sleeping was probably not the issue.  Talking in your sleep about wanting to eat Taylor Swift with jelly and a hand pump (your words not mine) may have caused an awkward moment or two...

I went for gently stretching and strengthening exercise - which I realise why I am sore now is because these are muscles that haven't been used in a long time. But the circle of talking about how we feel this week and keeping a straight face while others referred to the new moon etc, nap time at the end (it was kind of nice when the instructor tucked me in) and group ""ommmmmm"". It was a bit much really."
tifu,3dw5b3,mrs_zpc,14,Mon Jul 20 06:58:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a yoga teacher now and this was pretty much my initial reaction to yoga. I literally declared at one point while we were ""sitting on a thought"" or something, ""...it's an awkward silence."" Death stares from yogis are terrifying.  I learned I needed to soften up a little, learn to stfu and be present for a few minutes here and there, and that chanting is a great way to relax my chest and neck muscles, even if I feel like I might accidentally be incarnating an ancient evil. I also learned that some of those hippies say some real shit sometimes. I'm also okay with myself and my body for the first time in oh, I don't know, the majority of my life, so I do personally feel like there can be a benefit to letting your boundaries get fucked with a bit.  There are some teachers who have a ""no Om zone"" approach, but it might be hard to find prenatal classes that cater to that demographic, since it's generally assumed that you're a peanut butter & pickle eating ball of emotions, but you might be able to find a class and talk to the instructor about whether they're confortable and able to provide modifications for you."
tifu,3dw5b3,SomeDumBetch,4,Mon Jul 20 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"what does ""no Om zone"" mean exactly?"
tifu,3dw5b3,lineycakes,8,Mon Jul 20 18:06:50 2015 UTC,"They stay away from chanting, getting all fluffy about prana/energy, etc. They basically treat it more as straight exercise. While I hate to direct anyone away from their local yoga studio, sometimes gyms are good places to find less ""floofy"" yoga classes. There is also a book by that name, but it's more directed towards those who teach."
tifu,3dw5b3,SomeDumBetch,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"Gootcha. I have my ""floof"" limits, but I love the spiritual part of yoga. :)"
tifu,3dw5b3,lineycakes,3,Mon Jul 20 19:45:23 2015 UTC,"Haha, you and I are in the same boat. I was really pretty uncomfortable with it at first but I'm now 1/2 sarcastic, potty mouthed, crass - ass broad, and 1/2 loving, accepting, om'ing, reiki - giving flower child. It's a good balance, I find it a lot easier to stand myself these days.   (Edit to add the rest, bc I posted early)  I do get the no Om thing. Some people just aren't gonna get down with it, and even without the ""floofery,"" Yoga is one of the best things you can do for your body. Other people may need to get okay with the idea of finding their own space, without putting any ""meaning"" to it, in order to be comfortable. I just think it should generally be more of a stepping stone.   I also think there's a danger to dropping the ""sacred space"" most teachers establish. A lot of poses leave one both figuratively and literally vulnerable, and as Bikram and a few others have shown us, there are already potential issues with boundaries and respect. I think the instructor having a mindset of assisting with a personal - spiritual practice is more likely to lend itself to healthy boundaries. I also think it can be easy to feel bored at times if the spiritual connection is left out. I also think that its slightly irresponsible, as yoga can often bring forth a lot of emotions for people, and the spiritual side helps provide a path for those emotions to travel, instead of being confusing... But I also think every-fucking-body should do yoga, so the rest of me thinks ""whatever, get 'em on the mat."" ;P"
tifu,3dw5b3,SomeDumBetch,2,Tue Jul 21 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"I'm with you completely. I personally started yoga at a really rough point in my life, so it was more a meditation-while-moving class for me at first. It was like my escape - for one hour I could go and think about nothing else but my breath (or try to lol). It really helped me strengthen my mind & my own personal boundaries. For that reason it just wouldn't be the same without the floofs! All your points are very valid too - I like the sacred space/boundary & respect point. I can imagine a gym class leaves a lot of room for people to hit on other people haha. But...whatever gets them to try it!  I think it's important to have your own filter in class - not to write everything off just because you don't like or are confused by one thing the teacher said about the moon or pranayama or chakras or whatever lol. I have one teacher who regularly talks about politics which I have to filter out. I don't always disagree with her, but it seems out of place.   Namaste! :)"

tifu,3dw5b3,almightykiwi,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"While this did make me laugh I just want you to know, yoga is not that bad! If something hurts don't do it, you could potentially hurt yourself. Only do what feels good, if you can only touch your knees during forward bend that's fine! The more practice and the easier it gets. Yoga is tough, its not a simple workout like a lot of people think. But its incredibly rewarding in so many ways. I really would encourage you to give it a few more tries. No one is judging you in class, they're all too wrapped up I'm their own practice. I asked my boyfriend to join me in my home practice, at first he hated it because he couldn't get into the poses I was doing, but now he's flexible enough to touch the ground and his downward dog is nearly perfect. You can do it! Maybe try some at home videos before going to class again, there's a nice beginner 30 day challenge from Doyouyoga on YouTube, I'd suggest trying that. That all being said, yoga is not for everyone, but it takes more than one class to decide that. I really hope you give it another try! Namaste!"

Do you know if I should try recovering files on there or would that damage the flash chip?  Thanks dude. The company I'm looking at has a ""no data no fee"" thing, so I won't be paying for ""nothing"". The only hope I have is that   The file can be recovered   and   It won't be corrupted (as if the key is corrupted, I'm still kinda SOL).   Fingers crossed.     E:  Just looked at your links. Due to the TPM-less nature of my computer, I couldn't set up a passphrase as well (or maybe I wasn't looking hard enough, IDK). I also didn't have AD set up. sigh The only option was to create the recovery key file onto a USB. Your links require me to have the recovery key.   On your second link, I didn't create a DRA cert. I also didn't print out the file. Really kicking myself right now.  Still, any input is useful."
tifu,3e1tyq,MLaidman,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:43 2015 UTC,Assuming you mean flash drive(?) as in a USB drive? It shouldn't damage it.  Those links to the Microsoft page assumed you were locked out of your windows machine though.  I'll poke around a little more to see what else I can find.  If the recovery company has a guarantee of some kind that's a pretty good deal. Unless they just recover the Windows install you put on it and claim that that's data so you're on the hook to pay for it...
tifu,3e1tyq,MLaidman,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant USB drive. That's good to know, so I can try as many times as I want to salvage the data without fear of the chip degrading? I won't be writing to it, just reading from it.  I'm sending the USB drive to the company in the hopes that they can recover the Bitlocker Recovery Key. The SSD stays with me.  Your links assumed I had more backups (AD DS, DRA, or emailing it to myself). Sadly, this is not the case.  PS. Sorry if my tone is a bit rude, still kinda mad at myself."
tifu,3e1tyq,MLaidman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:49 2015 UTC,"Well, no that's not entirely true. Every time to read/write from memory it degrades a little bit. The chance that it's going to become unusable at this exact moment is pretty unlikely.  If you're not writing to the drive, then the chance of recovery won't be diminished either. Overwriting data over and over is what would ruin your chances.  Sorry those links were unhelpful. I just quickly skimmed through them and thought they could be of use."

tifu,3e46n2,friendofredjenny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they asked about it because my friend has literally said all week she's afraid of her dog and then a total 180 when the shock collar came. Told them for the handler it's not good because my friend is already displaying the psychological affects of what the shock collar does. She uses that as alpha reassurance and it will start a downward trend when her SO will want to get rid of the collar. That and I cannot condone the shock collar coming to my house, not just because of myself but also MY SO and his hatred of shock collars. I've had to be straightforward with my friend that I believe it's her fear and other ladies in the group (who doesn't have dogs or experience in pet sitting dogs and is not the caretaker or said dog when they are on vacation) is encouraging her to use the shock collar and that I'm a bad friend for not supporting our other friend, because I gave my recommendation to get rid of the shock collar.  I'm not sure how to approach this now. It happened this morning and there's still an ongoing debate. I offered to assist in training the dog but now it's a principle issue of supporting friends decisions of which I cannot in good conscious for myself do.   Yeah basically they are pissed I gave an opinion they didn't want to hear by the sounds of it but the implications of that run deeper into technicalities of moving forward with that key difference."

That sounds like a nice group of friends, would be a shame to have a lasting wedge driven between you all, my SO and I would kill for just one more couple lol."
tifu,3e46n2,Sassanach36,2,Tue Jul 21 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah its a pretty good group that is long standing. We've all been friends for over 4 years and it's a conglomeration of work friends with spouses mingling with friends of spouses who all become friends and turned into a solid group of 5 couples and a number of singletons. The lady group consists of all the women who are part of the group in 1 chatroom on line app as our primary form of everyday talk and organizing things. It was in the chat that my lady friend asked us about the collars last week, then this week she was talking about it after they got it. My SO and I discussed the situation this morning and then it all blew up when both my SO and I agreed the shock collar wasn't something we could agree with, while another couple in the group encouraged the use of the shock collar.  On a side note, while I can't leave the chatroom now after its been created without causing more drama, I have decided to forgo further regular use of the all women chatroom and keep planning things to a smaller level. That room can become a hot spot for drama, it's the 3rd subject in the last month since we set up the room that caused issues. (Perhaps it showed me which women I would prefer not to argue with lol) TIFU version 2, it was my idea to make the chatroom in the first place to help us coordinate and have a place to talk openly without drama. #fail lol"

tifu,3e46n2,activeXdiamond,2,Tue Jul 21 23:29:56 2015 UTC,Maybe you should put that shock collar around her neck and press the button a few times. See how she likes it.  Without proper training a collar won't do shit.  Shock collars are not necessary and can cause burns.  I think it is assanine that your friends would turn against you for giving advice.  She needs to address her issues or if she can't give B up so he can live in a loving home.
tifu,3e46n2,activeXdiamond,2,Tue Jul 21 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the support, I didn't go so far as to say what you did, but that echoes my thoughts. We don't put shock collars on children to teach them to be proper, it's very similar to animals, no need to inflict pain to get the point across. But apparently that's not a universal thought.   I told the couple that unfortunately I won't be able to watch their dog while the shock collar is in use as it goes against my principles, the psychological damage could put my dogs at risk, and they did ask for my opinion so i gave it to the best of my knowledge. If they use it, I have no control over that but I can remove myself from being care taker."
tifu,3e46n2,activeXdiamond,2,Wed Jul 22 00:16:09 2015 UTC,"You have that right.  People would speak out if a child was being spanked.  THis is similar.  I might have taken it a bit far and of course we would be more dipolomatic.  But shock collars are fear based discipline.  Your still the Alpha...but you are being a cruel Alpha and pup is obeying you because he is afraid, not because there is a bond."

The plan was to wait for a clear night this summer: I would ask her to go for a drive out of the city where the light pollution is reduced. I'd pack a sleeping bag in the car, a bottle of our favourite white wine, some Ritz crackers, cheese, and deli meats. We would lay under the stars and point in excitement as shooting stars go by (we're nerdy like that). I'd reminisce about how our relationship has grown, talk about our future together, and if the mood felt right, I'd lean over and ask her to marry me.   We'll definitely do this some time this summer though!"

tifu,3dvp3n,GuttersnipeTV,13,Mon Jul 20 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly I like the fuck up proposal.   I don't know your SO, but as a girl I think men try too hard to plan a ""perfect proposal"" and they put way too much pressure on the moment. No offense, but I think the original idea was kind of cliche. Then again, I think most proposals are lame so I'm not a great judge lol  Also, to.all men out there, always by the ring a bit too big. It's much easier to have it made smaller than to have it enlarged."
tifu,3dvp3n,Lamenardo,4,Mon Jul 20 09:42:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily close to getting married anytime soon (I don't think...), but I think OP, and most guys put so much pressure on themselves to create a ""perfect proposal"" really just because they want it to be something amazing for their SO to remember. And I think what OP might've been going for was a sense of surprise to invigorate the feeling of being proposed to. Just giving my two cents because I like giving surprised too haha (is it two cents or two sense...?)"
tifu,3dvp3n,skeptickal,6,Mon Jul 20 12:00:48 2015 UTC,"Eh. As a girl I don't even care about a proposal or a ring. I'm cool with waking up one morning and deciding to just elope.   My SO and I already plan to marry eventually so the idea of waiting for a proposal seems stupid. Besides, I hate surprises and lack of control so the whole concept seems more stressful than fun to me.   Also its two cents hahaha"

tifu,3dvp3n,annamae970,202,Mon Jul 20 05:59:22 2015 UTC,"Grats man. This is a lot sweeter than how mine went.  I too had been dating my wife for 10 years before popping the question. I wanted it to be perfect, but since I felt I had waited so long to ask I rushed it. I'm also a bit weird and once I had the ring in hand I thought how horrible it would be if I waited for the ""perfect"" time and something horrible happened to me or her and she(and her family) never knew that I was actually going to marry her. I didn't have any doubt that she wouldn't say yes. I just doubted one of use would be alive the next day, lol.  So the night I got it and got home I found her in our bedroom petting the cat on the bed.  I reached into my pocket and said, ""I've got something for you"" and tossed the ring box at her. I tried to say some heartfelt things, but completely choked up. She just smiled and said yes.  Not very romantic, but hell...life isn't the movies. Plus I'm far better with words. I gave her my entire ""speech"" the next day so she could read it and she cried and said yes again.  And don't let people tell you that you waited too long or the guy in here who said it was a fuck up to wait 10 years.  You took time to get to know each other. You've most likely weathered a lot of bs and still you stayed together for 10 years. Most people get married too soon and they end up divorced. 10 years of being together is when most people split, so looks like you and I are beating the odds.  Grats and good luck, man."

tifu,3dvp3n,lydocia,3,Mon Jul 20 18:26:22 2015 UTC,But don't delete this thread. Never delete this thread.
tifu,3dvp3n,Lamenardo,4,Mon Jul 20 10:49:06 2015 UTC,Water works just as well. Maybe a bit of soap. The con? When you put her fingers in water she'll start to pee...
tifu,3dvp3n,Lamenardo,6,Mon Jul 20 08:31:35 2015 UTC,I can't find the con
tifu,3dvp3n,Hardrainfalling,50,Mon Jul 20 12:00:01 2015 UTC,Jesus she's got tiny fingers.
tifu,3dvp3n,lydocia,29,Mon Jul 20 02:33:40 2015 UTC,Good for OP. I bet it makes his dick look huge.
tifu,3dvp3n,lydocia,10,Mon Jul 20 08:39:29 2015 UTC,i like the way you think
tifu,3dvp3n,WinterOfFire,24,Mon Jul 20 11:47:13 2015 UTC,"We were just discussing this with her sisters... They both tried to try her ring on, but weren't even close to fitting at all. She's got great dainty looking hands! It's like a Cinderella thing with the fitment of this ring."
tifu,3dvp3n,ciobanica,3,Mon Jul 20 02:40:14 2015 UTC,At least you were finally able to get the ring off.
tifu,3dvp3n,Hardrainfalling,58,Mon Jul 20 06:28:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, this procedure ended up working great on proposals, but I would not recommend the ""drink till unconscious and then experiment"" method in the future when you plan on having kids."

tifu,3dvp3n,Hardrainfalling,9,Mon Jul 20 08:35:41 2015 UTC,It doesn't seem like anyone but you is concerned about the blackout drinking.
tifu,3dvp3n,toadofsteel,23,Mon Jul 20 05:58:27 2015 UTC,"I think OP means it more like, ""she drinks a couple of beers and then she falls asleep never to wake up again"" sort of drunk, not the ""she drinks until she falls unconscious"" kind of drunk."
tifu,3dvp3n,toadofsteel,26,Mon Jul 20 06:23:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, she's a heavy sleeper as it is. After a few drinks throughout the night, when she goes to bed, she sleeps pretty deeply."
tifu,3dvp3n,irondal2,22,Mon Jul 20 06:41:34 2015 UTC,"There you go, OP. People always assume the worst but not me, I've got your back!"
tifu,3dvp3n,LaineyYo,5,Mon Jul 20 06:43:02 2015 UTC,I'm a very heavy sleeper.  I wouldn't even have to drink to sleep through stuff like this.  But I think I actually sleep less soundly when I drank that evening.  Of course if I were the woman in this story I would have roused slightly to something tugging on my hand and shoved him away without gaining full consciousness.
tifu,3dvp3n,Retrodeath,2,Mon Jul 20 07:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i mean she wouldn't have woken up at all if she was blackout drunk... or at the very least she wouldn't have been coherent enough for a yes, and would have remembered almost nothing the next day..."
tifu,3dvp3n,beccamorty,2,Mon Jul 20 13:30:12 2015 UTC,I guess. He will have their whole life to see what this is. I don't think I've ever been so sleepy that somebody could play with my hands and I didn't wake up. (Sleepy/drunk) And I have been drunk.
tifu,3dvp3n,GuttersnipeTV,6,Mon Jul 20 06:30:00 2015 UTC,"I was pregnant and my husband started poking my belly to make my son kick.  Apparently they had a whole bonding play session together without me waking.  After quite a while I did finally wake up, lol.  Very heavy sleeper."
tifu,3dvp3n,2Xinquiry,6,Mon Jul 20 07:42:42 2015 UTC,"I sometimes sleep like a light a breeze could wake me, and I sometimes sleel like a cannon could go off next to my face and it wouldn't even reach me.  Not all people are the same. When my dad sleeps, you can use his belly as a trampoline and he wouldne wake."
tifu,3dvp3n,OnesNew,7,Mon Jul 20 06:39:09 2015 UTC,"Call me old fashioned, but I like my wives-to-be lacking a perpetual state of blackout drunk that can apparently be triggered at will. Kids these daus."

tifu,3dvp3n,flare_phoenix,16,Mon Jul 20 11:43:46 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I think at that point though I would have just left it, pretend that was the plan, and let her wake up with the ring on her finger. And when she's yelling your name, going ""WTF IS THIS?!"" that's when you drop to the knee and ask :)"
tifu,3dvp3n,baby-flower,14,Mon Jul 20 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, the mind fuckery that I could've pulled off is limitless!"
tifu,3dvp3n,mmencius,4,Mon Jul 20 04:22:57 2015 UTC,He could have even let her wake up with it on and then make up a story about how he proposed last night after they got back from drinking. Fear of rejection out of the way.
tifu,3dvp3n,vanillacupcake222,35,Mon Jul 20 08:02:07 2015 UTC,"3.5? She must be tiny! I'm teeny and have like a size 4 ring, I know how hard it is to order that, 3.5 must be harder! Good for you, for doing that research and not just assuming the standard 6/7 size will do!"
tifu,3dvp3n,lydocia,20,Mon Jul 20 02:00:35 2015 UTC,Welp that clears up why his wife is such a light weight
tifu,3dvp3n,vanillacupcake222,27,Mon Jul 20 05:53:54 2015 UTC,"Well, in all honesty, I bought her a ring five years ago that she was to wear on her right ring finger... I originally was advised by the salesperson that she'd be around a size 5 based on my description. But when I saw a size 5, I thought it looked wayyy too tiny. I went with a size 7. When I gifted it to her, she put it on and it looked like a key chain ring! Ended up exchanging it for a size 4.5."
tifu,3dvp3n,digitaldeadstar,4,Mon Jul 20 02:35:53 2015 UTC,I have small hands and narrow fingers; I wear a six - a seven when I'm fat. Y'all're barbies.
tifu,3dvp3n,AdseyV,2,Mon Jul 20 06:43:54 2015 UTC,Yeah my ring is a 4.5 and I remember the jeweler ranting about how small my fingers were. 3.5 is sooo tiny! OPs fiance must be adorable.

tifu,3dvp3n,BClark09,79,Sun Jul 19 23:52:59 2015 UTC,She pretty much had to say yes since the ring couldn't come off LOL
tifu,3dvp3n,Sen7ineL,21,Mon Jul 20 01:51:14 2015 UTC,You can marry me or I can chop your finger off. Your choice.

tifu,3dvp3n,SandDollarBlues,7,Sun Jul 19 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"I'm curious all, don't most people talk about marriage plans before one person proposes? I would hope so. If you did this OP, couldn't you ask for her measurements then? Or is that like... just a bit boring? Do people do that?"
tifu,3dvp3n,wwildflower,5,Mon Jul 20 05:35:17 2015 UTC,"You know what, I never really thought about asking for her ring size. We'd talked about marriage and knew it would happen eventually. But I had always felt like it was a necessity for myself to establish a career so I'd have  financial stability before moving forth. She was caught off-guard by the fact that I had even thought about proposing.   I know a few couples that have gone shopping for an engagement ring together. Not my cup of tea, but some people are okay with that route."
tifu,3dvp3n,jessicabreit,17,Mon Jul 20 06:11:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, congrats! This is the cutest post I've ever read on here! Definitely not a FU! I hope you are very happy together!"

tifu,3dvp3n,dayungbenny,4,Mon Jul 20 11:00:02 2015 UTC,"This is how my ex PLANNED it and it was actually quite sweet.  He slipped the ring on, gently woke me up, then said ""I want to wake up next to you everyday for the rest of our lives.  Will you marry me?""  If I were you, when you retell the story in front of her, add a little line like that, like ""well, it's only fitting since I want to wake up next to her for the rest of my life."" There's a joke about the ring fitting somewhere in there too."
tifu,3dvp3n,AndItsDeepToo,4,Mon Jul 20 12:42:01 2015 UTC,It would've been more memorable if you had put her hand in a bowl of water to tried to loosen the ring up. Urine-gaged!

tifu,3dvp3n,JakePops,5,Mon Jul 20 07:10:26 2015 UTC,"Baggage carousel at the airport-we were long distance until a few months ago, so that was our meeting place.

tifu,3dvp3n,petterso,4,Mon Jul 20 07:15:07 2015 UTC,"That is so adorable!!  My sister meet her fiancé on tumblr, her in the US and him in England, and they recently got engaged..... On the 4 year anniversary of the day he sent her the first tumblr message. It was 'just by chance' but I'm pretty sure he knew it was within a few days of that date. So cute.   They went on a vacation together when she was visiting over there and they had a wonderful day then we're laying in bed together and he asked 'what's the one thing that would make this day better?' And she said 'I don't know.... Fireworks?!'   Then he pulled the ring box out from under the pillow and asked her to marry him....  So cute. Ooh man."

tifu,3e121a,scandalous_platypus,4,Tue Jul 21 03:25:09 2015 UTC,"This happened today. It began a few weeks ago. My kids are old enough to drive so I had them pick up some dog food for the 1st time. Sadly they bought a 30 pound bag of dog food for full-sized dogs. My dogs treat everything I give them like it is a divine gift. Though the kibble was much too big for my mini poodles, it was pretty adorable watching them struggle to eat it.  Eventually, I asked my neighbor if he wanted the food for his full-size dog. He said sure. A week passed and I hadn’t brought it over, due to laziness. My wife is about to come back from a trip out of town and I was cleaning up to impress her with my non-laziness. My neighbors weren’t home, so I left the dog food on their porch. I texted the guy a few minutes later, but then I saw that the huge bag of dog food had been carried to the curb. I thought, “That’s odd. It must not be their brand.” I brought it in. My neighbor showed up at my door 10 minutes later. He explained that they had put down their dog earlier today. His wife came home to a giant anonymous bag of dog food sitting on her front porch like a psycho’s practical joke. The only fortunate part was that she didn’t have the kids with her. I was mortified. I invited him in and we drank a toast to the dog. He was really decent and wasn’t mad. I still haven’t seen his wife.   Damn man, that sucks. I'm sorry for you both."
tifu,3e121a,datmetaldough,3,Tue Jul 21 03:33:29 2015 UTC,Ouch.  That is really rough.  Was sort of expecting to read that you had accidentally FED your neighbor dog food.
tifu,3e121a,sunSparkle,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:39 2015 UTC,"I thought he gave his nighbour-dog (like his neighbors dog) food, like human food."

First make sure you haven't done anything to agitate them that this would be the breaking point.  Have you been making them do to much of the work packing?  Have you indeed decided to take too much or are you being inconsiderate in any way.  If not try to see what could be bothering them.  You are leaving for colledge and this can cause a lot of emotional angst for parents.  If it really is just the pillows your folks have bigger issues then you acting spoiled...which you aren't.     I have a confession...I took...Oh my God I'm so ashamed...FOUR pillows to Colledge and one was...gasp!...a body pillow!  My parents were fine.  FIgure out what's going on and how you can fix it.

You can call me crazy if you like, but I have had dreams that seemed like your average dreams, then something similar to an event in the dream would happen in real life sometime in the next few days. It would always have some correlation with either something I feared would happen or something I was excitedly anticipating. For example, multiple times I have dreamed that a package I was expecting in the mail arrived, and the next day it would always be there. These ones would be accurate down to what the packaging looked like. Some would be more vague, and others would have merely symbolic meaning, but I could almost always interpret them as a foreshadowing of a future event later on. I swear this true, as crazy as it sounds. Oddly, though, this kind of thing hasn't happened to me in a long time."

tifu,3e1c8z,TheGamingPlatypus18,3,Tue Jul 21 07:25:10 2015 UTC,OP basically spun the fans on his computer manually when the computer was off. This caused unexpected power (turning the fans worked like a generator) that led to damaging two important computer parts.

tifu,3dvvhy,candycaneforestelf,10,Mon Jul 20 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"When you attack someone because they defend themselves against a violent chick, you can't claim the moral high ground. White knights get so aggressive for something as simple as telling a woman to fuck off when she is yelling a you for some bullshit reason such as not holding the door for her when she is 20 yards out. Both of these examples are from personal experience."
tifu,3dvvhy,Pickup-Styx,4,Mon Jul 20 05:33:57 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah of course, there is no need to get violent, and when it is purely for the chick's affection then there is no question.   Those are valid examples but much of the time I see the white knight term used when people are actually just standing up for someone else and doing what they genuinely believe is right, and not out of anger or spite."

It was a long, gray, slender path that stretched into the horizon. It sparkled underneath the sun's rays with such beauty that it left me awestruck with wonder. Such beauty had to be cultivated, and mustn't be ignored. So, I ran into the street, with quickness like no one had ever known, but then I heard a voice. It was my aunt's. She said, ""Come here, insertnamehere! kissy noises"". I was left distraught. How could my aunt, who I've trusted all this time, treat me like some kind of...animal. She must hate me. I feel disgusting inside. I'm undeserving of the respect a human being receives, so my aunt resorted to calling me like she would an animal. I don't know what I should do with my life now.

tifu,3du3sv,orange_lazarus1,2,Sun Jul 19 20:31:42 2015 UTC,I have a question about this....if you go to a college within your state (non privatized) will you still come out with crippling debt?
tifu,3du3sv,never-ever-post,7,Sun Jul 19 20:30:39 2015 UTC,"Obviously this depends on your family income, scholarships, and the university itself, but it's pretty easy to shop around and find a decent school that will leave you with 10k or less. For most state universities, sticker price is for the wealthy and not too bright; if you're working class and have a really solid academic record, your odds are good.  Also, some state universities will offer in-state tuition to people from other states under certain circumstances, so don't be afraid to apply everywhere. It's cheaper to apply than to miss out on a good value education."
tifu,3du3sv,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,5,Sun Jul 19 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"I am past schooling at this point, just something I see on reddit or hear from other people.

Seems like they made that choice to be frank."
tifu,3du3sv,never-ever-post,7,Sun Jul 19 21:26:29 2015 UTC,"part of the problem is that a lot of fresh 18 years olds wil ltake out the maximum loan amount per year. I mean, they're like 'we'll give you the 8k you need for this school... but if you want another 6 grand for living expenses that's cool.' what shotsighted 18 year old is going to say no to that. So they come out with 14k in loans per year, 56k debt total. This is me, and 28 year old me wants to go kick 18 year old me's butt."
tifu,3du3sv,Rayezilla,4,Sun Jul 19 21:30:46 2015 UTC,=\ Seems really unfair to see the large amount of posts about college and debt on reddit when it can all be avoided.
tifu,3du3sv,never-ever-post,6,Sun Jul 19 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"Except that is an unbelievably naive and simplistic view of the issue.  Assuming someone can just get a job while at school is a huge stretch,  not only because the jobs market anywhere near a universities campus is going to be scarce as best, but also because many majors (STEM mostly) are very competitive and to get good grades you don't have time for a full time job.  And let's assume you do get a job,  work 20 hours a week and make 12 bucks an hour,  a ridiculous wage but I'll humor you.  In that case, you will earn 12,480 dollars.  That's not even enough for tuition at a private school and only leaves about 7,000 if you go to the cheapest of state schools.  Take out, say 500 a month for rent.  Now you have 1,000 dollars to eat and entertain yourself for 12 months.

I told my manager that I did apply for a job at the other managers department but never got a response back on my application status.

Just as the cord is severed, the mother looks up from her baby's face to look at her husband, only to see him standing aghast in the doorway, eyes locked with the strange man clutching their babe's umbilical cord.   He then proceeds to piss on the afterbirth while staring the real father in the eyes to assert dominance, yadda yadda yadda."

I was dating a girl when I was 16, and the best place to park was in my driveway, because crepe myrtles lined both sides of the drive so it was hidden pretty well so we had lots of privacy.  My girlfriend had a curfew, so I had to have her home by 10:00 pm.  This one night her curfew was changed to 11 pm.  We were making out pretty hot and heavy, when ""BOOM!"".  My mustang shook and I got up and look out the windshield.   All I could see was the back of a Ford station wagon that crumpled my hood. I forgot all about my mom working night shift as a nurse, and she was leaving for work.  I fell out of the car half-dressed, scared, and my girlfriend uncontrollably laughing.  My mom said ""What are you doing?"".  In my infinite 16-year-old wisdom I said, ""We were just talking"".  We didn't get either car fixed because mom didn't want her insurance to go up.  So we both drove damaged cars until we got rid of them."

tifu,3dsyyh,mutatersalad1,70,Sun Jul 19 04:13:57 2015 UTC,"When I was with my best friend's family on the lake for the fourth of July, I was letting her little brothers take turns being chucked off the pontoon boat into the water, cause kids love that shit. We were getting inventive with how I was throwing them just to mix things up (I threw one over my shoulder, like a tiny flailing piece of lumber, which was actually pretty cool), and I had a really piss poor moment of judgment.   I picked up the youngest brother by his life jacket, facing towards me, and then on the count of three I chucked him up and backwards out as hard as I could. The only thing I didn't account for, was that when you throw a child vertically, they tend to kick their feet. Hard. Needless to say (but I'm gonna say it anyway), as I lifted him up and began throwing outward, he started to kick both of his feet.   Now, one kick from this kid that had that much momentum would have been a perfectly sufficient amount to incapacitate me. But instead of getting one blow in, this fuckin kid, who plays soccer by the way, drills me three times in the balls, in quick succession. Him hitting the water coincided almost perfectly with me face planting onto the deck, as both of my hands clutched my surely ruptured testicles while I collapsed forward, my instincts demanding that I tend to my baby gravy brewery even at the expense of whatever might happen to my face upon impact with the wood of the deck.  2/10 I wouldn't recommend this experience to anybody. Unless you're into that kinda thing. Pervert."

Who cares, it's natural, he's going to do it regardless, so why even bother with having a potentially ridiculous awkward convo.

I am wondering, ""WTF is he doing?  Is he pretending to trip?  WTF is going on?  Um we're getting awful diagonal here.  WTF is going on?  What's happening?""  Now, I'm 4'10"" and he is 6'2"", so I had a lot of time to wonder just what was going on.

When is lying ever good form? Following with its own unintended consequence, like, for example, the unpleasant self awareness of knowing that you're lying, while trying to look your manager in the face amid the guilty wondering if he/she knows you're lying; gosh I feel silly explaining this like you're five, self worth maybe, fuck."

tifu,3duje9,LBenDover,3,Sun Jul 19 19:57:52 2015 UTC,A drawer being short isn't enough reason without warning. You could've just made a mistake. If the drawer was short because you stole money out of it you wouldn't have been able to collect unemployment.

tifu,3duje9,NuclearLunchDectcted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Very true. It is the job. So sorry you had to deal with threats. When a customer raises their voice at me it makes me feel threatened and anxious. I have always dealt with it by saying ""Im going to get someone else to serve you."" Or if I am alone I walk up to the front end of the store with all the cashiers and ask a manager to escort them out. I just can't engage. It freaks me out."
tifu,3duje9,Sin53,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"I think the most colorful characters I ever had to deal with were when I worked at McDonalds.  Had one lady literally pee in a cup and throw it at the drive thru window, another guy chuck his Big Mac at the menu bored (oh no, it had pickles on it), one lady who refilled her sweet tea SPECIFICALLY to re-open the lid and pour it all out on one of the registers (I was the manager that day and witnessed it myself, she was not provoked), and the WORST was a lady who spent close to 45 minutes (not kidding on that) in the drive-thru ordering her breakfast, and had us remake it THREE times.  She got the cops called on her though-she actually threatened my life because I took her sandwich back to put the cheese on it that she requested (while wearing gloves).  People are entitled ass holes.  I always try to be nice to those people who work in customer service-chances are they're already having a worse day than you are."

Some people hit a plateau when dieting and fat burners, ecgs, and yohimbe will help. But most people think they can sit around on the couch and lose weight just because they took a ""diet pill"" lol.

I realized there was hole in my rushed panicked plan  She was watching me use her green bush as a can   Quickly I pulled up my pants catching poo  There isn't a damn other thing I could do!

The  only really shitty thing is that I have this constant ringing in my ears, so any other ringing or high pitched squeal that comes out (Squeaky car brakes, fire alarms, etc) is usually VERY dissonant to the pitch in my head and instantly causes a headache."

tifu,3dv4ah,yxfletchxy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:46:48 2015 UTC,In a situation like this chances are the motherboard had fried a component somewhere but the rest of the PC is fine.  Power supplies are pretty rugged these days and its simple to test if they work.  The CPU would be fine since it would be practically impossible to fry it unless the motherboard died in a very specific way as to cause a voltage spike.  GPU might be an issue since I believe they pull full power at boot.

If the CPU socket is phased out (Intel chipset), you might need to buy a replacement secondhand or pay a premium for a retailer's short stock.  My advice would be to fix it up first and then tell your friend what happened (embelish a little so he doesn't freak out - say your cat only peed on one part, for instance). Seeing as you've fixed everything up, he shouldn't be too mad."

tifu,3dteez,mr_munnin,40,Sun Jul 19 09:33:01 2015 UTC,"Guy who's been roofied and kidnapped by rather a unsavory type of people here.  My rules to avoid being roofied:   Never, ever leave your drink unattended. Never accept drinks (especially drinks that come in a cup or glass) that come from people you do not know well. Do not drink in places that have a lot of drug users as clientele.  Do not accept drinks served by a creepy bartender, or by a bartender with creepy friends. Do not accept drinks by strippers. Do not trust anyone to watch you drink for you because they will not watch it as well as you would. If you set your drink down at a party (EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT TO IT), that drink is done. Do not try to drink from it. Don't drink at raves. If you're trying to drink illegally and you're underage, don't accept bottles that have been previously opened.  If you feel like you're way drunker than you should after a low amount of drinks, you've probably been roofied. This takes experience in knowing your limits to be well versed. Immediately call someone and get the barkeep's or bouncer's attention. Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, it's probably the case.   NINJA EDIT: Obviously a lot of these rules are based on circumstance. Use some fucking common sense."

tifu,3dteez,hardeehaheehee,10,Mon Jul 20 10:16:45 2015 UTC,"during the summer break of when I was 17, once i took a bus which was 2 stops away from the subway station i was going to and there was a guy in a pink shirt staring at me. whenever i looked his way he would look elsewhere, but u get the idea. im a pretty alert person, so when stares linger for more than a normal amount of time, i start to get cautious about freaky people. i got off the bus and noticed the guy get off too. well i mean he probably wants to take the subway as well. i go buy some water before i head off to the subway. as im walking down the stairs to the station, i notice a guy wearing a pink shirt. wait 10 mins have probably passed since i got off that bus, it doesnt take that long to walk down the stairs... and why is he looking at me. oh wait no hes turned his head now... proceeding to walk down the stairs. at this point i could definitely sense something was wrong. i walked down the stairs at an incredibly slow speed. it felt like i was taking one step every half minute. i thought better keep him in front that way i could see where he's going and not the other way around. but at the same time, i noticed he was going down the stairs quite slowly as well.   after there were no more stairs and i saw that he was looking at the subway map and that gave me the chance to skadaddle past security check and onto the platforms. as i was swiping my metro card, i could see in the corner of the eye that guy was in a rush as well cutting in front of people to get past security check. OH SHIT THIS CANT BE A COINCIDENCE, he's coming after me isn't he?!!!! i got a head start and prayed for the subway to come so i could try to blend in with the crowd. at some point the subway came, and i hid in a corner, occasionally peeking out for any pink shirt creepy dudes. i then thought way ahead and decided to get off at the next stop and wait for the next train... u know just in case this guy was on the same subway as i was. but eh i didnt realize that maybe that guy took the train behind me and he would have better chance of catching me than before... but who knows, he was nowhere to be seen.   so i got on the next train and but still felt a bit off... JUST IN CASE he's on this current train, i shouldnt go home immediately, otherwise hed just follow me to where i live... so i decided to make unnecessary subway line transfers, at some point i didnt even know where the fuck i was going, semi lost/confusion, like i would know how to get home, but should i get off now or wait for the next transfer line stop. i eventually got tired of walking around from line to line (may i also note in heels:( bad day not to wear my usual sneakers ) and i was tired from all the paranoia i was having.  fast forward to probably 2 hours later of subway riding lol. i rode about 20ish stops, while it usually just takes less than ten for me to get home. on the way home theres a kfc, its a hot sunny summer day, after this whole thing ive just experienced, why dont i treat myself to an icecream. they are cheap/cooling/creamy, why not. and as i come out from kfc, i contemplate for a second to go right or left, and as i turn my body, I AM FRICKEN BLINDED BY A GUY IN A PINK SHIRT. OH MY FUCKING GOD. I THINK IM ABOUT TO HAVE A HEART ATTACK, SHIT FUCK, THIS IS SO CLOSE TO WHERE I LIVE. DID HE ACTUALLY FOLLOW ME BACK HERE?!!!! at this point im full on freaking out, my legs are wobbly, my throat is all dried up and oh great, this icecream is melting down side of the cone. and then he speaks. ""hey we met earlier on the bus today and now we are meeting at kfc. i think it's destiny seeing eachother twice in a day. i want to get to know u better"" DESTINY MY ASSSSSSS? more like u frickin stared my face off and then proceeded to stalk me to my home! but as i said i was having a little panic attack, and to be frank a bit scared/freaked cause there werent that many people in sight and I was worried he would continue to follow me home and i had blisters on my feet for wearing heels all day, aka couldnt run very fast. so then i mustered up whatever strength i had left and tried to sound as aggressive as i could, ""No goodbye"" (which i bet came out sounding like a squeaky mouse). after, i disposed my 9/10 new runny icecream to the nearest trash can and fast walked out of there as fast as i could. i took the short cut home and called a guy friend for some comfort, whilst looking behind me every few seconds to see if anyone was following me. there are guards at the gates of our subdistrict, so i told them to look out for a tall skinny guy in a pink shirt and not let anyone without passes to enter. i think they could tell i was pretty freaked out.  overally, this experience has got me even more cautious/paranoid than i was before. every time i look back on it, i wish i told that guy to fuck off /mad cursed in his face. me being a girl, it sucks that i have to watch out for creepy ppl at night, EVEN THOUGH THIS ALL HAPPENED IN DAYLIGHT. and like wtf, did he actually follow me across town through 20+ subway stations plus multiple transfers? thats sick:/:( and that destiny line he used, like who the fuck would buy that? thats crap yo"
tifu,3dteez,nosirrah646,21,Sun Jul 19 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"You should have gotten help in the restaurant, called the police, and you shouldn't have left alone. It's only chance that you caught him putting something in your drink and that he didn't catch you in the parking lot. You let him isolate you from the group of people around you, and that's how these guys get people.  You really need to call the police and give them a description of the guy. He's probably going to try this shit again, and he's probably pulled it before too. You could save somebody's life by calling this in.  I don't mean to insult OP or in any way victim blame though. Someone could be excused for not thinking clearly in such a situation, but I still wouldn't call OP's actions exemplary. Just as a PSA to everyone: don't do what OP did. There are many other, much safer, ways to handle this situation.  edit: I changed my comment to be less critical of OP. I've never been in a greatly similar situation so I'm not one to judge her decisions too harshly.  edit 2: Thanks for taking what I said into consideration OP. I didn't want to sound like an asshole and reprimand you, but I still felt my point was important enough that being blunt was warranted. I definitely could have walked the line much better though."
tifu,3dteez,w675,9,Sun Jul 19 13:44:39 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I think you're being a little harsh. Yeah, it's easy to say all this while sitting behind a computer, but when you're in the heat of the moment, especially if it's never happened to you before, you're not thinking as clearly as you usually do. Not even close.    So yeah, sure. There are things OP could have done better. But I'd say overall, she handled it pretty damn well."
tifu,3dteez,ImpossibleKintsugi,7,Sun Jul 19 15:48:54 2015 UTC,Studies have shown that mentally going over what to do in any given situation increases the chance you will do it if it happens.

tifu,3dteez,ImpossibleKintsugi,5,Sun Jul 19 19:30:32 2015 UTC,I don't train people. I meant we as a society. People can prepare themselves for most things if they just work at it.

tifu,3dteez,MC_USS_Valdez,6,Sun Jul 19 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"No. If you have a gun and pull it out, you better be prepared to shoot it. Using a gun as a deterrent is a terrible idea. That's like telling people to shoot for a limb. It doesn't work. You should only pull a gun if you're prepared to shoot someone. If they end up running, great. Don't have that as your goal though.  The reason is that if you pull it with no intention to fire- the other person could end up with it. Great you just gave them a gun. You want to be quick and decisive.   You don't shoot for anything but center mass because limbs move fast and unpredictably. Bullets don't disappear in a puff of sparkles when you miss. They just keep on going until they hit something or someone."

It is too big of a temptation. A real gun you need to know the consequences of pulling it out. Taser and mace aren't lethal, a bullet is.

I kept saying yes, but it kept coming back as a lie! I didn't know what was happening and then I just got really fucking nervous and everything else I was answering was coming back as a lie because I was psyching myself out. Even a stupid question along the lines of ""have you ever lied to your spouse?"" I answered yes because I lie to him all the time about ""finding"" clothes in my closet when I actually go and buy them, or totally lying about the amount of taco bell i consume in one week. For some reason the lie detector machine decided to fuck me over and the detective guy finally just said the test was over.

Is it possible she was lying about any of this for attention? Being in a different state with no way to communicate would be a great excuse if she was actually mad and just didn't want to talk to you.   I hope that doesn't seem rude!

I kind of made her out to be an attention whore in this post but it's honestly not how she acts. If she just didnt want to talk to me she'd tell me. And ive met her mom, she really would so something crazy like this.  C. Contacting CPS at this point is just not something i think i can bring myself to do. Theyre great people but after a lot of personal problems involving them and how i already kind of distrust myself on what would help i just really would struggle to contact them at this point.

Turns out he had a clot (or something like that I can't remember what he told us exactly as this was a few years ago) and the blood flow to his heart was 95% blocked. He was told that he was about five minuets from death. They put a stint in and what do you know, his heart rejects the stint. They put him on medication for it and he did recover after a few weeks. There are still some complications that he won't tell us, but we were all just so relived that he made it through.  Edit: glad you didn't die either, OP! :)"

The program highlights several cases just like yours.  apparently this isn't that uncommon.  The premise of the documentary is that getting a $100 heart scan can provide a very clear picture of your heart health and indicate whether intervention is necessary.  Additionally, the long-term use of statins (medication for preventing build-up of cholesterol) and low dose aspirin is as effective, or in some cases more effective, than use of stents.  Really interesting program and very eye opening --would highly recommend watching it."

Despite only being like 26 at the time I got peptic ulcers, a disease almost unheard of in anyone under 40. By the time I was admitted to the hospital my stomach couldn't keep anything down, since the ulcers stopped it from going anywhere beyond the stomach.   Like an idiot I thought my stomach was simply becoming less tolerant to certain foods when I began to vomit meals back up because of the ulcers.  I was by far the youngest patient on my floor at the hospital. I ended up in the hospital for almost a month, not even allowed to eat most of the time. If I lacked health insurance I would be over a million dollars in debt from that stay I bet."

But if this story is true she is either really desperate or likes you alot.

All jokes aside though, it never hurts to get tested. Once I got tested and medicated, my performance in uni went through the roof.

tifu,3dqqg9,properbloke789,63,Sun Jul 19 04:29:12 2015 UTC,"It absolutely never hurts to seek help even if you just think you might. See a mental health professional they will do a questionnaire or two. Basically to gauge out what you are concerned about and what might be the cause. If they think you have it they will diagnose you and probably start the process of getting you on good medication, be sure to give plenty of feedback on the efficacy and any possible side effects until you find the right one. Good luck"

I don't know what it would take for me to feel the same way about a new friend that I do about an old friend.  I want to hang out with my old friends.  I don't need to prove myself to them, and I'm so over the social acceptance thing (as I should be at my age).  I'm not saying I'm not willing to try and make new friends, but this process takes a long time usually and I do a lot of shit for myself.  Trust me, I wish I could just call up a small group of dude friends and go sport fishing in mexico or climb a mountain together.  I have money and I'm attractive to women, but making dude friends at this age is way harder than I ever thought it would be.  I've always been the kind of person who can get along with anyone.

tifu,3dqqg9,Scizmz,48,Sat Jul 18 18:52:24 2015 UTC,"Honest advice on this... pick up a hobby that requires other people. I was always introverted as a kid, moved like 9 times in 7 years before I hit high school.  It was rough and made it super hard to make friends.  I found that I was able to do it though hobbies.  As a kid it was geeky clubs and Magic the Gathering.  As an adult, I play poker and work on cars.  It does make it easier, you don't have to prove anything to people and just being yourself is a lot easier if you don't feel you have to prove anything."

tifu,3dqqg9,PESTOLORD5,34,Sat Jul 18 17:43:39 2015 UTC,Thank you for this me and my ex have been broken up for like eight months and it still hurts. I think it's more that I grew up with her and now can't even talk to who I considered a best friend. But I see now it wasn't love hell we where together for two years and she found someone new in less then two months. The first time we dated it took a year to get over so that's what I'm banking on now.
tifu,3dqqg9,Walter_Malone_Carrot,26,Sat Jul 18 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"My ex was the same way! I was friends with her since 1st grade and had a crush on her since 2nd grade (kinda weird hahaha). So when you say you lost a close friend, I know exactly how you feel! And mine moved on to banging a new guy in four days after a year together :/ You can't dwell on it, it'll only make you feel worse! Go out with friends, better yourself, TRY and talk to new girls (I know you can do it)! Keep your chin held high buddy, do this for you! :)"

tifu,3dqqg9,BellaDolce29,11,Sat Jul 18 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"Somewhat helpful...I recognize I need to get over it. However, the ""doesn't treat you like poo"" part is perhaps the most difficult thing. My ex would never treat anyone like poo. Literally one of the most amazing people I have ever met...she just doesn't want a relationship anymore."
tifu,3dqqg9,soulelite,8,Sat Jul 18 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately people sometimes just lose feelings for others :( You have to think of it this way- If you truly love her then you would want her to do what makes her happy. I know that may sting, but it's the sad truth :/"

Thank you for reading and responding though. It's one thing to realize what you've said, but it helps me to accept it when other people say it. (And venting is sort of nice too.)  Thank you for reading. You are awesome."

Letting him go was the worst, but I knew it would make him happy and that's all I've ever wanted for him. Still didn't stop me crying and begging for another chance like a little bitch. Miss him every day. Minimal texting. I am sure we will be friends later on down the track, but getting through these early days without him, without my best friend, is so hard."

Then at the end you see both of them connect just in time to see projectile vomiting.

tifu,3dqqg9,lurkerhorker,130,Sat Jul 18 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"If this is any consolation, my ex broke up with me over text almost a year ago exactly. The first few weeks were tough but I got through them and the tables turned very quickly. Within 2 months I was happy again because I took my extra time to exercise, reconnect with old friends etc. After about 10 months I went on several first dates (which I love), I hit honors at school and was awarded a continuance scholarship, and most importantly I start a full time internship on the 27th which is related directly to my field. I'm sure some of these things would have happened regardless, but that break up was an opportunity for me and I'm so thankful for it.  More relevantly, my ex broke up with me as an attempt to go for another guy. That shit didn't work (maybe because he smelt disloyalty?) and what augmented her frustration is that she expected me to be furious with her but I refused. Harboring bad emotion doesn't do anyone any good. Now this isn't to say I wanted to spend time with her, I just threw the relationship away and got on with doing me. She got pretty agitated with that because I assume she wanted me to validate her ego by putting my entire life on hold to be depressed because she broke up with me.  It's now been nearly a year exactly , and a week ago while I was in Toronto she asked me to go to Canada's Wonderland with her and I agreed because, after all, friendship was something I could do so I said sure. That went perfectly fine and when it was time to say goodbye I could tell she wanted me to make a move because she looked broken when I distanced myself enough to make sure that didn't happen. I'm not happy about making her upset, and it wasn't revenge at all, but tables do turn OP. And they usually turn in the favor of whoever finds genuine happiness first. That starts with you."

tifu,3dqqg9,abnormalsyndrome,62,Sat Jul 18 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"In my experience girls underestimate the amount of time ""gamer"" boyfriends spend playing games.  They don't mind in the beginning stages, they may even try to play along.  After a while they stop playing along and they start just doing something different while you play games.  Then they start getting upset that you don't spend more time with them than with your games.. All the meanwhile you're thinking.. ""Wtf, I'm still doing the same crap I've always done, she's crazy.""  That doesn't help.  Soon enough while you're playing video games she's diddling your sporty brother who prefers to drive around in his truck with his polo collar popped getting road head from your girlfriend.  They come back home arms around each other, you put down the controller and look up.. She says ""we're done asshole, enjoy your fucking games"". Your brother says ""haha, you retard"". You stare in disbelief.  They head upstairs, your mind starts to wander, you try to imagine they're just talking but you know what's really happening.  You walk into the kitchen, grab some water.. It's pretty warm inside, crack the freezer and throw a couple pieces of ice in your glass.  Head back into the living room, sit down, adjust your glasses.  How.. What.. My god.. The rage starts to build. What can you do?!  You think, I'm tired of my brother always fucking with me!! Ever since middle school he's been such an asshole!  Walk back into the kitchen, grab the sheers; you think ""I'm gonna go scare the shit out of this cocksucker.""  March upstairs, with purpose for the first time in a long time.  Walk into the room, she's on the bed, legs spread, he's thrusting.  You freak out, this is too much to see in person, you can't control yourself..  The force of your rage enacted through your arm drives the shears through his back like butter.  He screams"

tifu,3dvf3z,Lamenardo,6,Sun Jul 19 21:36:02 2015 UTC,Here's the thing - when a guy starts to think about killing an entire group of people right from the start - they might not be friends doing normal friendly ribbing. You need to kinda re-evaluate how to interact with people.
tifu,3dvf3z,pat000pat,6,Sun Jul 19 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"OR the guy who wants to kill other people and is planning to do so - instead of looking for other ""real"" friends, as you all claim they were not friends - has a mental illness.

However your friend isn't mentally stable anyways and you should get him checked out"
tifu,3dvf3z,Lamenardo,6,Sun Jul 19 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"Inappropriate username. Dude needs to ditch you guys and find some quality people to hang out with. And a psychiatrist.   So here's the vibe I'm getting here - you dudes all share a similar sense of humour. It's sort of your acknowledged friendship quirk - to mess around with each other. Then along comes Shy Guy. You instantly let him merge into your friendship group. Guy is shy, but no matter - he's one of the boys and we'll treat him just like one of our friends. Except maybe no one stopped to learn his sense of humour first. Maybe he laughs, and plays along, being shy, but maybe he just isn't up for constantly having his gears ground. Maybe it constantly gets to him. I don't know."
tifu,3dvf3z,PrincessPlastilina,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but why does Shy Guy not say anything? Or, if he does not feel welcome, look for other friends who share his humor?   He should not let it happen without saying anything, and a clear mind would not make plans to kill his ""friends"". I dont know what you guys are thinking about, but it seems very clear that the Shy Guy is the one who has mental problems."
tifu,3dvf3z,Noitsnotalright,2,Sun Jul 19 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, he definitely has mental problems. No denying that, nor is it OP's fault. I'm just pointing out that it kinda appears he didn't stop to think maybe Shy Guy could have been hurt by the ribbing. As a general rule, shy people don't do so well with that type of jesting. And he can't just ditch 'em, he works with them.   Shy people generally find it pretty hard to speak up. When everyone is having a bit of a laugh, a good time, it's really hard to speak up and say hey, I don't find this funny. Take it from a woman, there are some people who will get offended that someone doesn't find them funny, or they don't realise how bad they are bugging someone. Sometimes it could be someone who goes home at night and cries because the work colleagues ribbed them about their wonky nose, or single life, or sometimes it could be the mentally ill person who goes home and fantasises and killing you. I just want OP to take a look around and make sure there aren't any of the former in his life, or any more of the second."
tifu,3dvf3z,shitterbug,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:55:45 2015 UTC,"You said it, he's mentally ill and OP needs to back away slowly, and maybe let someone in his family or workplace know immediately.

We alllll undermine the shy, awkward, quietly angry guy, but I think we've seen enough tragedies to know that these people do warn those around them when they think about doing something...

So you get these rather indescribable experiences of ""this is how it's supposed to be"" when you wear a prosthetic dick or bind your breasts (e.g. flatten them with a special undergarment) or, if you're mtf, tuck or wear fake boobs. Sexual reassignment does wonders for the mental health of trans people because they dont have to deal with the distress of having to live in body they see as foreign."
tifu,3drmba,Shurigin,7,Sat Jul 18 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"I get this, but at the same time...it annoys me as a non-transgender to deal with my dick 24/7 (random boners for example), I can't really picture wanting to have a big dick in your pants while also dealing with female things such as periods. I don't envy you /u/Sir_Henry, you've got it tough."
tifu,3drmba,kwturpin,9,Sat Jul 18 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"I had this thesis that when the child is developing in the womb (as you know we all start as women) some unknown element, trauma, etc is introduced and that unknown variant shifts the gender back to the opposite sex leaving the mind / hormones developed as the sex it was going to be but the body as the opposite I have named this thesis Fetal Gender Reassignment"
tifu,3drmba,PolishRobinHood,5,Sun Jul 19 03:47:19 2015 UTC,"hey, want to start off by saying I'm no expert in this but just wanted to add my two cents. The way I've been taught that fetal development occurs is through two ducts (the Mullerian and the Wolffian), with the Mullerian progressing into the female reproductive system and the Wolffian becoming the male's. At around 6 weeks after fertilization the presence of testosterone causes testes to begin forming in male fetus (here I guess their brain starts 'acting male'), and the testes release Mullerian Inhibiting Hormone (MIH) which stops the Mullerian from growing and actually causes it to recede - the Wolffian can now progress into the male reproductive tract. If testosterone isn't present by ~9 weeks then the Wolffian naturally recedes and the Mullerian grows into the female reproductive tract. So whatever sort of trauma you posit in your hypothesis should either prevent MIH from working (for FTM, so they get the testosterone fuelled brain but still get a Mullerian duct, and maybe the Wolffian recedes due to Mullerian presence?)  OR some mutation that prevents Wolffian duct from receding in MTF (so they still don't have testosterone, but have male reproductive tracts, since the Wolffian's presence stops the Mullerian from progressing). Again, I'm not an expert and just wanted to give some ideas on how this might be possible! All very speculative haha"
tifu,3drmba,TerrorEyzs,4,Sun Jul 19 00:01:36 2015 UTC,Wow! Did you actually write a paper on this or is it just a loose thesis? I'd love to read the paper if you did write it!
tifu,3drmba,annekat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:25:52 2015 UTC,"It's just a loose thesis and that's pretty much it in a nutshell but I believe whole heartedly that its viable and welcome anyone to research it further Just credit me please haha  edit: got cut short by IT at work but I was going to add that to me this explination not only answers the transgender longing, but also might explain homosexuality as well as pharamones could also be affected... I'm working to hard to research further"
tifu,3drmba,adulaire,2,Sun Jul 19 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"Exposure to varying hormonal levels in the womb is one of the stronger situational variances that may in fact eventually explain homosexuality.    Subsequent male children are more likely to be gay.  They are also exposed to higher levels of estrogen, which naturally happens to the mother during successive pregnancies.  Just one of a few correlations.  Link"
tifu,3drmba,annekat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:35:26 2015 UTC,"There isn't any conclusive evidence one way or the other since we don't really have the capabilities to get evidence for that yet, but there are many people who hypothesis that something like hormones at just the wrong time or something is the reason why like you think. Hopefully one day we'll know one way or the other."
tifu,3drmba,adulaire,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:48:07 2015 UTC,"I am intrigued by this idea. But I warn you, people may react negatively to this stance because that would basically say there is something ""wrong"" with them that needs to be fixed."
tifu,3drmba,enderandrew42,2,Sun Jul 19 02:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, it has to be brain structure. What's fascinating, though, is how the brain ""knows"" its gender. I'd like to understand that.   Sorry you have a male brain, pal. Everybody knows girl brains are better."
tifu,3drmba,Look_Deeper,4,Sun Jul 19 06:06:53 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the answer to your question is actually fairly straightforward. It's the same part of the brain that deals with recognizing where your body is spatially and the room you're taking up - when you're reaching in front of you, for example, you generally have a fairly good idea of where your hand is, even if there's no reference point other than empty air. So your brain has to be very ""synced"" with the shape and size of your body, or else you'd be incredibly clumsy (imagine if a really tall person's brain had the same spatial awareness as that of a really short person - they'd be knocking over things they reached for on shelves and running into light fixtures constantly!)   I'm not a scientist but I do have a special interest in understanding this and I've read some neurology papers, this is just my best understanding of them. Hope it helps some :)"

Trans people don't just get bored of their gender and decide to change it.  It's a neurological condition that has been very poorly understood until recently, with modern science and a shift in the social paradigm allowing people to better cope with it and take positive action.  Didn't want to use the word 'condition', because that sounds negative, but the point is that the brain itself is different.  Almost literally a female brain inside a male body, or vice versa."

tifu,3drmba,TheRealNightfire,4,Sun Jul 19 03:24:22 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the necessity of flexibility-the plastics required to be both firm and flexible...fleshlike...are unfortunately sticky on the surface, at least in an affordable form. Even the cheapest 'packer' can run upwards of $100...for a sticky one. The outer layer meant to mimic skin often feel like the hardest surface of homemade jello...impervious but...tacky to the touch. As they age, degrade, and through use, this sticky surface gets stickier. More advanced -and less sticky- plastics exist but, in the form on an average sized dick, often cost a few hundred dollars. Trans men (and others) often have many other expenses (waxing, gender appropriate clothing for a non gender appropriate body, hormone theraoy, etc) and, like most all of us, certain limits to their disposable income. And most of these items are available to the average person only online....so no touch comparison. So it often happens that you order a dick that looks like what you want, and it mostly lives up to your expectations,  but has a sticky skin that grows stickier over time. Exactly like those toys you throw on the wall. As a side note, these plastics generally offgas pretty harmful shite and its worth it to invest in non-sticky ones if you use them regularly, but not always an option. Hope that helps. I have some links I can share when not on mobile for more info about the materials used for sticky and non sticky dicks, will update in the next few days."

tifu,3dt18v,SecretAgentB,16,Sun Jul 19 08:15:19 2015 UTC,"""On Saturday, October 18, my friend was with his girlfriend. Now you may want to know that my friend has not gotten into a girls pants yet. But Saturday he was feeling lucky! He took her to dinner, then he took her to the movies, then they just talked for a while and around midnight he drove into an secluded yet pretty area to see how lucky he would get.  They kept on chatting and then they began to make out. As they made out it became more and more intense, it was clear they both wanted each other. My friend, being a gentleman thought it would be a pretty good to try and go down on her. So he slowly started kissing her lower and lower and lower and then began to unbutton her pants and pull them down and then removed her panties too. He then began to taste a vagina for the first time in his life. He found the taste poor and did not enjoy it, but under the seat of his car he came across a Jolly Rancher, he popped it in his mouth to cover up the taste and continued to eat her out. As he finished up he realized that the Jolly Rancher was no longer in his mouth. He didn't want to tell his girl that he just dropped a Jolly Rancher in her spasm chasm, so naturally he went back for seconds! After licking thru her vagina, he came across that Jolly Rancher. But when he bit down to catch it back into his mouth, it exploded and blood and puss shot all into his mouth and face. What he had just bitten was no Jolly Rancher. It was a herpies wart."""

That being said, I'm surprised that this happened to you.  The cup can cause more cramps if it's suctioned too hard to the cervix. Immediately after you insert, try breaking the seal a bit to loosen the suction.   Please see your gynecologist soon to make sure that you don't have any perforations!  edit: the study has vanished and now I'm reading accounts of other women expelling their IUDs via cups."

When they take it out, it's a pain that lasts for a second and then goes completely away. Squeeze a hand, yelp, and it's done.   Putting it in is an extended pain where they measure your uterus, fiddle with your cervix, insert the IUD, and then those little arms snap open. It's much longer and much more painful. It's still worth it though, I would do it again today if I had to. And for what it's worth, insertion was a lot less painful the second time as well.

The horror stories with the coil though are just waaaaay more horrific than any other device though I guess. If you go on a juice cleanse and your pill stops working, you just get pregnant.

tifu,3dt18v,JaysRooted,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:36 2015 UTC,"that's true, it does take some trial and error to figure out what works. i tried hormonal birth control and had an awful time, so the iud was great- i was willing to make a sucky period tradeoff for not having to deal with hormones or misuse-related failure. i do know people who have had not great experiences, but they never suffered any actual damage- just temporary pain. the horror stories will definitely be worse for anything that gets jammed into your uterus rather than a pill, haha, but the success rate and the quality of the average experience is also something to contemplate. i think it generally comes down to which risks/downsides you're willing to accept for which benefits."

I had been instant messaging her the entire time, and my friend's chat window was blinking in the background as he anxiously waited for the plan I was going to reveal. I just sat there realizing how awful my life was going to become, my face got hot, my hands got clammy. She told every single girl she knew, and suddenly half the seniors had printed copies of the chat and as you probaby would guess, I embellished a few details of the sexual conquests of her friends, so that just made me look like a double loser instead of just a douchebag."

I would probably try to tell her that I fucked up and I know I did and apologize. This isn't something that works all of the time, but it's a start. If she didn't see it, or doesn't seem like she did, and is still talking to you I say drop it and learn from this."

Thanks for reminding me though, I last had a tetanus shot in '05 and was due for a new one in April!  Does it help if I get the shot after the fact?

tifu,3dso9g,McDabberzz,11,Sun Jul 19 02:04:10 2015 UTC,"Something similar happened to me. I was 12 at the time, and was in a Home Depot with my mother. She had just started carrying pepper spray for personal defense and I must have thought it was a laser pointer or something as well. If I recall correctly it had a lock to the button similar to a butane lighter, and I sprayed that shit all over the faucet isle. My mom and I were passing through this ilse to get to the one across from it. As she's shopping I see a young couple being helped by an older employee. You can see where this is going. They are sitting there coughing up a lung or two and I'm watching in absolute horror. The best part is, my mom finished shopping and instead of getting in trouble I decided I would walk through this spicy isle, and suffered the same fate that I inflicted."
tifu,3dso9g,no_milkdrinker,8,Sun Jul 19 02:16:49 2015 UTC,"so I flipped it open and saw there was a button... ""Hmmm, a laser pointer?""....   Sometimes I wonder why they don't just put a big label on there that proudly proclaims, ""PEPPER SPRAY; DO NOT GET IN EYES"". At least then people wouldn't be accidentally mistaking the little keychain ones for more-innocent things and accidentally spraying themselves or other people. Seriously, having something that looks totally innocuous that will release pepper spray when mishandled seems downright dangerous."

tifu,3dwhne,fail_nerd,4,Mon Jul 20 02:51:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, touching other people's stuff without permission is not okay. Especially their phones, which includes pictures, conversations, emails... private things that she did not opt to openly share with you. You gave her an excuse, but really you should be apologizing profusely and promising you won't ever do anything like that again. Seriously, why would you just go and look through anyone's phone? I'm sure you wouldn't appreciate someone doing that to you. Expect to need to earn some trust back."
tifu,3dwhne,thisismydecember,2,Mon Jul 20 02:57:31 2015 UTC,Your a dick. go apologize and think of what you've done.
tifu,3dwhne,negroitis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:58:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're not trustworthy. Why were you snooping through her phone? It's not like she could be cheating on you... or...? Not sure I want the answer"
tifu,3dteub,belzbee,15,Sun Jul 19 07:30:01 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, if you cannot have a baby right now because it's financially impossible or it will seriously fuck up your life, then you can have the baby and put it up for adoption, or you can abort the pregnancy if you want. What does he mean by he wants you to have it? As in, keep it and raise it to adulthood? Or just have the baby? If it's the latter, you can put him/her up for adoption after the fact. If that's not feasible or he wants you to raise the baby to adulthood, you need to talk with him and reach a consensus. Im no expert, that's just my take on it"
tifu,3dteub,-Canonical-,5,Sun Jul 19 07:36:47 2015 UTC,"thnx,my initial thought after was I found out was to terminate it because I am not ready to be a mother neither of us can take care of it. I think he doesn't get that I will be the one spending sleepless nights with the baby and the heavier duty will fall to my family since there is no way I am moving in with my ex"
tifu,3dteub,thiscaptchaisfhisbd,19,Sun Jul 19 08:36:50 2015 UTC,"Stick with your first instinct. He's just gonna bring you more pain and misery, people like him never change while they are young, growing up is the only way they change. Also, a baby will only make it worse because you are now tied to him. Go your own way, t will be better in the long run, but I think you knew that."
tifu,3dteub,CaptinBlackHeart,9,Sun Jul 19 08:29:10 2015 UTC,"The two of you, as a couple, are over.  You have a hard decision to make with your pregnancy.  If you keep it this guy is in your life for like the next 25 years.  Adoption is a great option in my view but his role in this complicates things.  Likely he will say he wants to keep it in the false belief you and him will get back together (eventually) to raise the child.  The main point I want to drive home here is that whatever solution you come to make sure he's not a part of it."
tifu,3dteub,FartGoblin420,7,Sun Jul 19 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion, don't do it. He's just trying to cling to you, if you were his dream girl than why did he need a booty call? He was living the dream. The baby together scenario has fleeting emotions written all over it, and babies are just too huge to share with people you're unsure about."
tifu,3dteub,Sootraggins,7,Sun Jul 19 09:40:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry for him, but it's not up to him to decide."
tifu,3dteub,Techitch87,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:47:38 2015 UTC,"agreed. It's your body and you would have to carry it for 9 months while maybe he continues to hang with fling girl or such. If you have no moral convictions stopping you and you don't know that you would want to see the pregnancy through to adoption, IMHO it's your choice to end the pregnancy if you want. Also maybe food for thought but trying to start a new part of your life in a career and such maybe the whole stress factor of pregnancy may be too much? IDK really cuz I'm a guy but seems like pregnancy+hormones=emotional rollercoaster"
tifu,3dteub,SuddenDickTornado,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:00:21 2015 UTC,"IKR! but in my defense, we we're in a committed relationship (or so I thought) so I was using emergency contraception whenever we didn't use condoms. I guess something went wrong and they  didn't work this time."
tifu,3dteub,schadeschul,5,Sun Jul 19 08:08:28 2015 UTC,"Your X messed up and he should not get to decide what decision you make.    Going by your description, it was unplanned, he was not planning on becoming a father neither were you planning on becoming a mother.    Take the most logical step before its too late.  Edit: terminating an unplanned pregnancy doesn't make you a murderer! He is most probably using it as an excuse to cling on to you but once you have the child, he will most probably just walk away as and when he settles down with someone else."
tifu,3dteub,schadeschul,6,Sun Jul 19 09:05:21 2015 UTC,"Once a cheater, always a cheater. If you have this child, you need to have it with both parents in it's life, as you can't afford to stay home all day with it. However, he will pull the same stunt again- only worse, if you break up with him later, it won't be a simple goodbye. It will be court over visitations and rights and child support. Not to mention you shouldn't waste a single second of your time with a person you don't want in your life.  I personally recommend terminating the pregnancy. It is very early stage, so it's just a clump of cells. Don't beat yourself up over it. This is a very valuable life lesson for you, and you will come out of it stronger."
tifu,3dteub,fuckingfucker,3,Sun Jul 19 12:10:41 2015 UTC,"I've learnt the cheating lesson the hard way. The cheating is not even the worst part,its the lies and the fact that he never admits he has messed up. I do not believe such a guy is grown up enough to be a father,maybe if it we're two years from now,I could take on single mother hood."
tifu,3dteub,fuckingfucker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:08:35 2015 UTC,"Do what's best for yourself, because no one else will. You can do this. Already, you've shown strength in what I've read. Cut him out of your life, and start fresh having learned a lesson."
tifu,3dteub,Macc14,2,Sun Jul 19 08:41:10 2015 UTC,"Dumping X was clearly the right move and one you should have made sooner. I know it sucks right now, but stick to your guns. He will not change, he is what he is and you've decided that isn't right for you .You might be tempted to give him just one more shot. Do not do this. Not even as a booty call or as a FWB. Nup. Uh-uh. No way.  As for termination? From out here, it's easy to say ""Of course you should!"". Again, it sucks - but what's going to suck more? A baby, or an abortion?"
tifu,3dteub,LastOfTheDovahkiin,3,Sun Jul 19 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"that's true. I've also just had to accept that that's the way he'll always be. Maybe this will be his turning point too,but I can't trust him ever again. I'll stick to my guns"

tifu,3dteub,Analhurtz,3,Sun Jul 19 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"Don't have the baby, if it's still legal and not against your beliefs and what not. Once a cheater always a cheater imo."

tifu,3dteub,LadyNeptune_888,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:16:26 2015 UTC,"I thought the same. 18 with a now 1 year old daughter. Still graduating on time. Also starting college in August. It's a fucking blessing. My relationship is on and off but if you have family to support you, I say keep it. I was scared, my parents were extremely upset but after a day they were supportive and it couldn't have been better. But it's your choice do what's best for you! Good luck!"
tifu,3dteub,CourageousBeard,6,Sun Jul 19 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"I am touched that you decided to keep your child, one thing that scares me ontop of facing my family and society is that I might blame the child for my ex's mistakes and I believe a child should be brought up with love and a bond."
tifu,3dteub,Felusius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:14:47 2015 UTC,"And that's absolutely correct. All I can say is do what's right for you. I thought about aborting but I couldn't. Literally couldn't. My cervix was too ""small"" but in the end, I couldn't have anything better. It's amazing lol! If you need me feel free to pm!"
tifu,3dteub,baltimorebodies,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:44:30 2015 UTC,If you would rather not have an abortion adoption can be a really awesome thing but that's something you have to decide for yourself. As for all of the things your ex is saying now...it sounds like this is very recent news. He might come to realize how hard it would be to raise a child after he's calmed down and really starts to think about it. Hope everything works out for you!!!
tifu,3dteub,thelastblender,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:25:46 2015 UTC,"You can have the child and all, but if terminating it is making you upset, then give the child to a loving family who maybe can't have children but can give it all the love and opportunities it deserves. You could even have it be an open adoption if that makes you more comfortable..."
tifu,3dteub,mideon2000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:03 2015 UTC,"As far as the baby is concerned, make sure you think long and hard about your decision. My ex and I (we were together at the time) immediately chose the abortion route without putting much thought into it, and it's a decision I strongly regret to this day. Immediate guilt. Immediate heartache. I will not tell you to not do it, nor will I tell you what to do with your life. Just make sure you understand that every choice will have consequences, and terminating the pregnancy is definitely not the ""easy"" choice."
tifu,3dteub,-Canonical-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:01:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. Yes I've thought hard about it every single waking moment since I found out. Both options are terribly hard,but atleast I will keep the hope that in time I will have children when I can take care of them properly. Adoption seems like a hard thing to do too,after giving birth to the child only to have it taken away again."
tifu,3dteub,mideon2000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're going through a tough time now. It is 100% up to you, and I wish you the best of luck choosing the ""right"" decision. Also, remember that your ex has no power in this one, it is all up to you, and only you. Don't let his QQ's make your mind."
tifu,3dteub,-Canonical-,0,Sun Jul 19 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"Do whatever you want with the kid (keep it or don't, not our call) but your ex doesn't deserve go be in his child's life until he stops acting like a child and grows up."
tifu,3dteub,mideon2000,0,Mon Jul 20 07:20:54 2015 UTC,"X sounds like a confused and immature asshole who will only make your life worse. I would not want to produce a child with this guy. If you need someone to talk to about abortions let me know - I work for a nonprofit that ensures abortion rights across the States and can give you resources to help you finance the procedure and/or find places in your area that provide abortion services.   You are not a murderer. The way you define the cluster of cells that is growing inside you is what that cluster is. If you decide that this is your child then it is your child. If you decide that it is simply a group of cells then it is simply a group of cells. Don't let him shame you into making a decision that is not right for you and don't let anyone here tell you that you can't raise a child by yourself. The nature of choice is supporting women making whatever decision is right for them, whether it is terminating the pregnancy or carrying it to term."

But is anyone thinking that your cousin is actually talking to a ghost but the ghost doesn't want people to know so the ghost told your cousin false information? Idk. I have a wild imagination. I highly believe in ghosts because I have seen them when I was younger so I think your cousin really is talking to someone but then again she can just have an active imagination like you mentioned.

tifu,3dpba5,Bbxin,37,Sat Jul 18 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"Here's one for you.  (True story) When I was young I would always talk to my imaginary friend that I called ""the man with the hat.""  I would dream about him talking to me, and sometimes see him when I was awake.  Any time my mom would come in the room I would say, ""the man in the hat just went back in the wall!""  She just thought I had an imaginary friend.  Until one day she heard me talking to someone in my room and quietly opened the door. She jumped in and grabbed me and pulled me out of there. When I asked her what was wrong she said, ""I saw the man with the hat.""  I saw him a couple times after that, but not as often.  A few years ago I was at a family reunion looking through old photo albums, and I stopped at a very familiar looking picture. Apparently the man in the hat was my great grandfathers brother.  The rest of my family sees things too. We might just be crazy."

tifu,3dpba5,Arkcus,3,Sat Jul 18 12:44:02 2015 UTC,"I use to not believe in ghosts. I mean I was raised Catholic. And my father would always tell me that ghosts don't exist. When I started seeing my mother after she died, I thought it was part of the PTSD from the car crash. Then one day when I saw my mother, she told me to tell my father to make sure to still take that cruise. I did not know it, but my parents had been planning on taking me on a cruise for my sweet sixteen (it was to be a surprise). When I asked my father about it, he broke down and cried. I had never seen my father cry before, even at the funeral he didn't shed a single tear.  I have seen spirits since then as well, one paranormal investigator I talked to said that sometimes when someone is touched by death, it opens up another sense in which someone can see/feel the energies that have been left behind."
tifu,3dpba5,potatoesarenotcool,3,Sat Jul 18 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"Very cool, and also sad :( When you say ""touched by death"" do you mean experiencing the loss of a loved one; or experiencing clinical death and being brought back to life?"

tifu,3dpba5,potatoesarenotcool,2,Sat Jul 18 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"So I have a couple stories... Mostly mine and one of my moms (before I was born).  Mine: 1). When I was younger (about 3-5ish) I was able to see my great grandmother. When my mom showed me pics of her I told my mom that I see her everywhere and that currently she was in the room with us and she was talking to me. 2). About 2-3 years after my great grandma events, I was watching the news on the couch when I saw a white figure. It was in the shape of a person but there were no features to this figure. I know it was not my imagination because I blinked, looked away and looked back and it was there and it moved. When my mom came to me it quickly vanished. 3). When I was a little older about 10ish (this one is creepy)... Whenever I was in bed and looked at the light for a couple mins, I would see two people just going around the room arguing with each other. I was not hallucinating in any way nor was I sleep deprived. It was not people that were alive and I had no idea who they were. Maybe it was because I stared at the light for a few mins but would that really make me see these 2 people in my room prancing around arguing at each other?  My moms: So this is way before my mom conceived me. Whenever my mom would try to fall asleep, the music box on top of the tv would start playing. The thing that's creepy about this is that the box would have to be open to be playing. The box was never opened. Every single night it would play. My mom checked the box out to see if there was something wrong with it and there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. Then she started to get weird dreams about a little kid with the same music box. One night after the same dream of the little kid, she immediately woke up, heard the music playing, took the music box and drove to Stop & Shop. She opened the door (music still playing) and she said, ""I'm sorry but I'm not the one to give birth to you. I hope you will be able to find someone else"" (back then my mom had 2 miscarriages). After she said it... the music stopped playing. My mom got the music box and put it on the floor next to her car and then she went home and fell asleep.  I'm sorry if these aren't that great."

tifu,3dpba5,potatoesarenotcool,2,Sat Jul 18 15:55:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks :D I also have another story that I completely forgot about... I honestly don't know why I forgot this because this was the most recent event. This happened in spring of 2014. I was in my dorm with my boyfriend just chilling on the bed cuddling and watching a show. We were the only ones in the room as my 3 roommates were all out doing their own thing. I saw something near one of my roommates bed, a goldish figure, moving. I was so scared and turned to my boyfriend and I saw that his was face also terrified. I looked back to my roommates bed, didn't see it but I scanned the room and saw it was near the bathroom. I asked him if he saw it and he said yes. When all my roommates were back I told them what happened and one of them actually saw it before I did but didn't say anything because she didn't know if she was dreaming or was awake. A couple nights after it happened, one of my roommates woke up to pee and heard our door close but everyone was in the room sleeping."

Ok so the information about how many Mimis were buried on the said cemetery is a pretty easy to get one, so this doesnt bother me too much.  But the fact that u/gutterpeach is able to get all these information about birth, parents, marriage and even PICTURES of here is pretty impressive, but also damn scarry regarding personal information etc IMO."
tifu,3dpba5,kinda-blue,2,Sat Jul 18 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"It can be disconcerting but there are so many things that are truly public record. If you know where to look, you can get an amazing amount of data like how much someone paid for their home, who they work for, any lawsuits they've been involved in (stumbled upon my own parent's divorce case details from 30 years ago) along with more than I have time to list.  In Mimi's case, someone posted these photos on a genealogy website. Basic research gave me the other info. It is incredibly rare to find any photos, never mind how many photos I found of Mimi. I was blown away when I found them. She was quite beautiful.   Just think, she lived in a time with no Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc and I found out this much about her. People put their entire lives online now. Because of this, I've been able to reunite people with long lost photographs and family bibles as well as locate descendants of those buried in the cemeteries in which I work.

(doG forbid they have a common name like John Smith. Ugh!)  You can use FamilySearch.org for free and get a good look at the number and types of resources available and that's just online information.

He said he's in a hurry because he has a cab waiting for him around the corner. ( this was a fairly poor neighborhood and the guy didnt look like he ever took cabs).   So he hands me the iphone box, I hand him the money, I start breaking the seal to verify it, he starts walking away, and after a while he starts running.   It was an official iphone box but it was filled with paper. He had a friend in a car waiting for him around the corner.  Shit."

I'd rather focus on a business skill you need to develop:   I'm a bit desperate (and I haven't had any other offers) so I tell him I'll do $1800.   Never do this in a negotiation.  NEVER.  You dropped your anchor at $2000.  If they want to pay less, they need to make the counteroffer and it has to include some consideration, meaning they shouldn't offer less ""just because"".  It should be ""I'll give you $1800 for that laptop with cash RIGHT NOW!"" and they hand you the cash.  If having that in your hand is worth the $200 less, then you take it.    Always, always, always be prepared to walk away.  There are always other people to deal with.  Never act desperate, no matter how you feel.  You are playing poker constantly as a business person, and if you suck at it you will get rolled.  Cutting your offer just for the asking telegraphs to the other person that either you had no basis for your first price, or that you have no negotiating skills.  Why shouldn't they just keep asking for a lower price, or small add-ins?    Sorry to be harsh, but unless you do better this will cost you way more in the long run of a business than a silly $2k line item."

Everyone ive met on CL for any reason has been a nice person. But remember, it only takes one to end up in a body bag. And for the love of god, always check  what someone gives you before you hand them anything over. If someone's in a rush, jusg cancel the deal and send them on their  way.

tifu,3dpj89,p0kerduude,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry that happened to you, Craigslist is great, but also brings out a lot of really negative behavior in transactions.  I just wanted to drop some advice in this thread since I'm seeing a couple of these have happened to people. When you're on Craigslist buying/selling anything, be unabashedly protective on your end. Any reasonable person understands that since you met online anonymously, there is reason for suspicion. This includes  bringing people with you (buying or selling)  meeting in a public, busy place during the day  securing your items in a way that is more difficult to run while the money is being counted  only accepting cash  Lastly, be aware that you can potentially get sob stories in a play to get you to drop the price. In selling cars, I've run into this, fortunately there are resources such as KBB, Edmonds, etc... that specify fair value based on condition. Stand firm on price, and reference these resources if need be. It is easy to play to emotions to elicit pity, and it's on you to take care of yourself. It's unfortunate if that's the situation they actually have to deal with, but you are a rando on craigslist, you are never going to see eachother again"
tifu,3dpj89,grunglebear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:49:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry for your situation.  People, my number 1 rule for craigslist transactions is to meet in a police parking lot or in the lobby if the station is cool with that. No one will try to steal something inside of a police station."
tifu,3dpj89,MonsieurLeDrole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:55:23 2015 UTC,You let him within arm's reach of your laptop? What were you thinking?
tifu,3dpj89,XxDrsuessxX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"Good on you for going into a public place. For others who are inexperienced from Craigslist selling, here are a few tips. Always do it in a busy public area, on foot, and in daylight. Or a well lit busy area at night. Never go to their home or give them your address unless it is a large item like furniture. If you're buying furniture don't bring any cash with you until you make the decision to buy. Never hand them the object without having them count the money at the same time. Make the exchange at the same time. Usually buyers and sellers are just as nervous so you're not going to offend anyone by doing this.   My favorite spot is the front entrance of a local busy Kroger. There is a camera pointed right at the door. It's well lit and there are always people walking in and out."
tifu,3dpj89,juggernaught11,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"I sold $4k worth of silver coins on CL some years ago. I made the buyer meet me at my bank to verify his bills. Common sense, OP..."
tifu,3dpj89,XxDrsuessxX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"I mean that's your own fault. You can't let him take the laptop without counting the money first. I would never let anyone run off with what I was selling them after they gave me a sealed envelope. I don't understand how he ""took it"" and ""ran off"". Sounds like you'll be able to get your laptop back though considering you have the serial number and contacted apple. Good luck."

tifu,3dpj89,Macc14,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:16:28 2015 UTC,"Captain Hindsight, I know, but if you are doing exchanges like this, do them at a bank or police station.  People will think twice about trying things in those locations, and at the bank they have money if the person is short (some police stations also have ATMs)."
tifu,3dpj89,Eb_Money,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:24:27 2015 UTC,"Was looking to buy an iPhone 5S from some kid off of craigslist about a year ago. Met in front of Bestbuy and was checking out the phone. Everything seemed great, but the kid was super sketchy and had his cousin with him. Went to pull out my wallet and he pulls a knife. Grabs my wallet and the phone and runs away while the cousin just stands there dumbfounded. Grab the kid and throw him against the wall until the cops arrive an hour and 15 minutes later. Upon which they let the cousin go and said they couldn't do anything because he was a minor and already had a warrant. Ended up tracking him down Facebook that evening where he posted a picture of a bunch of weed he ""purchased"" found the geotag in his picture and reported his location to the local police department who didn't care and never followed up."

tifu,3dpj89,ehkodiak,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of dealing on similar sites to Craigslist, although, never actually Craigslist, since it's not very popular where I live. I have a few rules, with any electronics of significant value, I will only buy it from their house, people aren't likely to sell you faulty electronics if you know where they live. Items and money must change hands at the same time, even if they're just testing out my item, I insist on holding the money while they do this. Another thing which I employ while selling is to set the price a little higher than what I want, people are almost always going to offer you less than the asking price, if they actually give me the original asking price, I'm making more money than I wanted in the first place."

tifu,3dr0rp,jj9089,4,Sat Jul 18 21:42:52 2015 UTC,Holy shit this is probably the most blatantly narcissistic asshole I've heard about in a long time. You really dodged the psycho train there op. Really glad you got away before he could really dig his claws into your head. Roughly the same thing happened to a friend of mine just yesterday infact.  Except of her breaking up with him he got his friend to effectively chew her out and toss her into the gutter.
tifu,3dr0rp,inkyllama,3,Sat Jul 18 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"I had always pictured that narcissists cannot be the quiet shy type, guess I was wrong!    The narcissit got his friend to chew out the girl? For a joke? I hope they are no longer dating, that would be awful. I would have blown a fuse at that point."
tifu,3dr0rp,dodongo821,2,Sat Jul 18 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"Oh. shit, i forgot to mention it wasn't for a joke. It was because he was hiding the fact that he couldn't stand her calling him and not listening to her. (what to wear, what to see, even watching videos she didn't like with him) He couldn't stand her ""not listening"" but ""not listening"" basically meant all the very small things that he wanted her to do but she didnt want or need to do them.  The friend shortly beforehand was calling her a bitch and a slut and that she needed to stay the fuck away from him. Im guessing a ""subtle hint""  He was a control freak who wanted nothing but absolute control and obedience over her. Constantly lying to her face saying shit was okay when he didn't like it. Constantly making up fake trips (she would always believe they were real). He was an asshole. His character is that of a really socially awkward/shy person  but when you get inside its hell. I hope that asshole never gets someone as good as my friend again, but then again he probably wont.  tl;dr My week has been an emotional pair of concrete shoes honestly. I'd like to sleep and not listen to a phone call of crying. Send help  Edit: Shes already basically over him. This is because she has a cemented belief that he only stuck around for her body and the feeling that he has someone to ""dominate"" Shes also fairly emotionally unstable but then again thats a 17 y/o bipolar girl with confirmed depression, for you.   edit 2: i say week because they have been having a lot of problems for a week before this and i would get called after 12 regularly to hear her crying trying to calm her down for an hour then rip sleep"
tifu,3dr0rp,heitosj,2,Sat Jul 18 22:02:43 2015 UTC,That's awful! I'm glad she got away from him. No one deserves that. I'd be damned before I let a anyone dictate what shows I watch and what I wear!

tifu,3dr0rp,EGBallislife,2,Sat Jul 18 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going to put this out there: I can understand where he is coming from and why he acted that way and I think it's disgusting.  I'm a shy guy too- I've been bullied for a great deal in my life. Eventually, it stopped, because I changed myself. I started to get friends.  But a few years later, I fucked up. I became the person I feared years ago and got a friend of mine to tear up because I was bullying him- and I didn't even notice.  When he teared up though, I immediately said sorry and never ever did something like this again. It was a one time thing and I know I was wrong- it helped me being a more rational and better human being.  This guy though- he is so oblivious and ignorant it is infuriating. He obviously has a bad past; he probably/maybe got bullied. That's why I say that I know where he's getting from; but he hasn't learned a damn thing from it. How can you be so oblivious about what you're doing?"
tifu,3dr0rp,Ken1drick,2,Sat Jul 18 23:41:23 2015 UTC,Maybe. I can't say I know him well enough to confirm this though. I spent most of my time in this relationship either in silent treatment or apologizing profusely. I'd like to think he is better now and hopefully will find someone special in the future who won't bring out the bad side like I did haha

They also ended up coming to school to talk to my teachers when they found out about my girlfriend. They hardly let me go out of the house since then. I'm 17. FML. TIFU by letting my dad seeing my girlfriend's semi-nudes
tifu,3dpoqs,iamtoastshayna69,2,Sat Jul 18 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"I feel you, I was in a VERY abusive home at 16, my adoptive dad's wife read every conversation I had with anyone, knew my email and password, and I wasn't allowed to go anywhere because I called her a bitch to a friend and she heard it. I also was not allowed to use the phone to even call my adoptive mom."
tifu,3dpoqs,abj2aqua,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:41:30 2015 UTC,Whoa. Now that's taking to a whole new level. I feel sorry for you bro. How'd you escape their clutches anyway?
tifu,3dpoqs,iamtoastshayna69,3,Sun Jul 19 07:06:21 2015 UTC,"Well they kept screaming at me that they didn't love me and hated me and just wanted me to leave so that's exactly what I did, I walked off. I only lived there for 4 months (though it seemed like an eternity and I still have mental issues from it) I knew where the school was and over heard a police officer lived nearby. I walked to the school and turned to look behind me every step. I saw the cops house, a woman answered, I managed to keep my composure till he came to the door and I lost it all. I had to take 5 minutes to stop crying before I could tell him why I was there. I will always be grateful to Officer Tom of Wishek, ND. He in a very real way, saved my life."

Here, one simply does not get a job unless you're like at least 20-21, and even if you do run away, there's a 99% chance the police will pick you up and throw you back into your house with a snide comment on the ever-growing balls of the upcoming generation."
tifu,3dpoqs,iamtoastshayna69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:44:41 2015 UTC,"When I lived with my adoptive mom they did just that, on top of it I got sent to a ""runaway house"" for 2 weeks. It was both miserable and amazing at the same time. I felt like I was free for 2 weeks. Depending on where you live and how much your parents and school look for you they do it here too. Some people get away with running away as kids but that is usually when the parents are drug addicts and couldn't care less and the schools are over populated and don't care about one less kid."
tifu,3dpoqs,ArtaxNOOOOOO,7,Sun Jul 19 08:01:13 2015 UTC,"Not all parents are like that, which I'm sure you know. Mine had lots of rules, but told me I could leave at any point if I didn't want to follow them. It sounds harsh simplified like that, but it wasn't really so bad. I was a dick as a teenager, and so I joined the Army asap. When I got to basic training, I learned really quickly how big of an ass I'd been, but I was still glad to be out on my own (even though the Army was paying for everything). I moved back in with my parents briefly when I got out of the Army until I found my own place, but I had my own rules then, paid them rent, and got out again asap. Been on my own ever since and have a good wonderful relationship with them. Probably helps that I made them grandparents a few years ago too."

In an 8 day period I ended up seeing her 6 days (700-800~ miles total) on the 5th date I stayed the night with her and on the 6th date I realized how I was being used and how immature this girl was, basically that shit went to hell in a handbasket. I guess my point is my parents are very lenient and I wish OP had the same especially considering she's 19."

tifu,3dpoqs,Yamirou,6,Sat Jul 18 10:19:13 2015 UTC,"Usually when people have a choice like this to make, they do the opposite of what you did. It may not mean much from a total stranger who has nothing to do with anything, but I'm glad you are not making the same mistake.  Parents should not be controlling their children like this, but guide them and warn them about the world. Let them live their lives and learn from mistakes. Behaviour like your parents' seems more harmful than anything and they'll probably regret pushing you away.   I hope everything works out for you!"
tifu,3dpoqs,carrote,5,Sat Jul 18 13:31:49 2015 UTC,"I'm happy for you as you feel that you made the right decisions. Keep in mind of all the costs you are going to have to pay for yourself out YOUR own pockets. College is not cheap, loans will be a huge pain in the ass. Rent, food, and gas will be something that is somewhat hard to manage if you have to include college tuitions too. You won't have the luxury of your parents paying for the necessities anymore, but if you are happy with the newly founded freedom, who else has a say in what you do with your life. I wish you the best of luck!"

In addition to literally every punishment you got I also lost my bedroom door.  My offense, though, was being 10 minutes late home for curfew because I picked up a drunk friend who had gotten in an accident. Kicker was that I was trying to contact my dad to ask if it was ok. I decided my friends wellbeing was more important.  I said fuck it as well and went into the military. I had no other options."
tifu,3dpoqs,TerrorEyzs,2,Sat Jul 18 21:42:15 2015 UTC,The abusive home I was in wouldn't let me sleep in a bed and took off the bathroom door because I fell asleep in the bathroom after being beaten awake and hiding in the bathroom. So I feel you there.

I once posted the autobiography as a TIFU but no one commented or liked (or even disliked) so I don't know if it got through because I used real names or something like that.

They still think that abandoning me was the right thing to do and that I deserved it because I had a mental illness that they didn't want to treat.

I also got a few hits with a broom, so while she was in the bathroom, I grabbed my phone and left, barefoot (because she hid my shoes). Apparently I had called her bluff because when she realized I was gone she called me about a dozen times and when I finally picked up asked me to come home. Then proceeded to ignore my existence for about a week, and eventually went back to being her usual moderately crazy bitch. I don't live with her anymore, but the years in between then and now have certainly done some emotional damage.  You did the right thing. Best of luck to you in your independent life."

Sure, you owe him an apology for breeching his trust and likely have lost privileges of sharing his belongings in the future, but you owe an apology to her, a person whose efforts you destroyed without consideration of her investment in it, whether it represented time spent with her brother learning how to build something on his computer, or something she taught herself and had pride in, or something else.  PS:  You also judging her creation as ""not that good"" in another comment is horrible.  The quality of her creation in your eyes has no bearing on it's worth to her and him, what it represents and what was invested in it provides the value.

tifu,3dtzos,Lazylass,2,Sun Jul 19 13:53:49 2015 UTC,"It could be that he's angry at you for destroying her house and he might see it as you being an insensitive dick, I doubt he'd get emotional over his sister's house being destroyed in minecraft, he probably knows you were just joking but is angry since you took it too far. I doubt he's forgotten it, but I don't think it will have a huge effect.

tifu,3dtzos,AF_Bunny,0,Sun Jul 19 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"This is not about a little girl's Minecraft house.   Yes it is, I legitimately feel bad for what I did   This is not about you being cool.   I only mentioned my popularity to give everyone some context/extra detail. TIFU would be pretty boring if every post was 2 sentences long. But you're right, it's not about that, I never said it was about me being ""cool""   Hell...this is not even about how geeky you are.   Again, never said that was a big part of the issue, just extra context.   You're just a teenager crying over losing popularity in a group you were a part of.   But... you just said it wasn't about that? Being popular and being cool are essentially the same thing, so is it about how cool/popular I am or not. The answer is no of course, I apologized to him today and apparently neither of them gave a shit, and my friend was surprised I had given it any thought.    Shit happens. Get over yourself!   Obviously shit happens, and ""Get over yourself"" means stop taking yourself/your issues too seriously. At no point did I say this was a major problem.  In fact, I was accusing the friend of being too sensitive, so not sure what you were smoking when you wrote that.   You'll be surprised how none of this will matter at college when education loans and legit-sex times happen.   So friendships won't matter? The minecraft house doesn't matter, it's that I needed to be more cautious of other people's sensitivities. Your whole argument is that I shouldn't take these sorts of things seriously, which I completely agree with. But the problem is that I often don't take these things seriously enough."

tifu,3dtzos,DefinitelyNotATSMFan,-5,Sun Jul 19 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"A few things wrong with your comment.  *At no point did I say I was in the right, I've admitted numerous times that I was in the wrong, and regret what I did. I wouldn't be putting this on TIFU if I thought everything was fine and dandy.   *I never said it was cute, (so why did you bring it up twice) and I've previously mentioned that our group likes messing with people, so it's not like I'm the lone evil prick in a group of innocent little angels.  *The fact that you said ""Your"" instead of ""You're"" twice, and called me a ""Teenage Asshole"" indicates that you're very young, and perhaps take a game that's basically virtual legos far too seriously. I've been a gamer (And frequent Minecraft player, since Beta 1.4) my whole life, and even I find it quite funny that you think not taking games super seriously makes me a pathetic ass.  *It is just a game, plain and simple. While it feels rewarding to build something great in a video game, comparing it to works of art in real life is insulting.  *It actually does matter if the build was good/bad, or if it's fixable.  If I accidentally dropped a friend's phone on the ground and it broke, it would obviously be a mistake on my part, but it would matter a lot less if it was a shitty $30 supermarket phone, compared to a $850 Samsung phone. (Smaller mistake if the consequences are smaller) Now imagine I drop a friend's shitty $30 phone on the ground, and it breaks, but it can repaired very cheaply and with little effort. Do you really think there's no difference?"

I was a little emotional and your post hit all the right buttons.       I apologize for using the wrong your, I do not apologize for calling you a teenage asshole. I have been and seen on to many servers where people this it's hilarious to destroy other peoples projects. If you have been on Minecraft for as long as you say you KNOW that the exit button saves the world. As for you saying that to compare Minecraft to art is insulting, you obviously haven't really looked at some of the builds people have put out. On Youtube there is a poster who makes INCREDIBLE roller coaster rides, that is a form of modern digital art.       Just because something isn't special to you, ie $30 phone to a $850 phone doesn't mean it's not special to that other person. What if after you broke it you found out it held something irreplaceable? Somehow that, to me, makes the $850 phone mean nothing."

I was an exchange student from France, staying with a German Senpai who slept at my house in France two weeks prior. I greeted his parents with a warm welcome, oh how nervous I was at the time. Then, I saw his sister. She was so cute, just an adorable little thing. My cheeks went red. As proper of me, I leaned forward to give her a kiss, but as I was doing so, accidentally tripped over my shoelaces, sending me downward into a heap. My body ached, but I felt something warm and soft in my hand. It was nice to hold. All of a sudden I hear a whisper: ""Baka ~nyan"" I looked up and noticed I was groping my Senpai's sister. Immediately, I became completely embarrassed and covered myself in blood caused by an involuntary nosebleed. I immediately stood up, and apologized profusely to her. ""Baka,"" she whispered again. After that I was punched in the face and went into a three day coma. I have yet to recover the lost dragon-meme balls.  '"

If you are depressed, there are still ways to treat depression so that you can live a normal life. You are worth something. You have value. Don't give up without trying.   I've been through traumatic events and depression and I'm now able to live a good life and I am happy. I had to ask for help and go to therapy and talk about my problems. That helped me learn how to think and how to deal with my depression and work through the traumas of my past. I was planning my suicide, but now I feel like I am a completely different person.

Wife is nervous to drive after so long (she's never actually had a car to drive, being a poor graduate student). We only have the one car now and we're both a little anxious to put her on the road in it without some practice time.  Eventually, we'll condition her properly, but she's stretched thin right now."

People have bad days but no offence, from what I've read she sounds like a piece of work. My ex used to pull this crap all the time.

Common things can set the Explosive Trace Detection machine off, due to chemicals (such as glycerin or nitrates) that're used in a wide variety of products. Some things that can realistically trigger false positives:  Lotion and creams (including muscle rubs) Colognes/perfumes Deodorants Hand soaps/sanitizers Medicines one takes (such as nitroglycerin for heart conditions) Fertilizer (from gardening, farming, or even on your shoes from walking on a recently fertilized lawn) Handling or firing ammunition recently Baby wipes TSA agents not changing gloves (if they processed a positive earlier, traces from that could result in a positive on your luggage).  Tips for traveling: Don't use products containing glycerin on your hands, body, or clothes before traveling. If you're cleaning up a spill in a bag, don't use hand cleaners, baby wipes, or the like to clean it up. If contaminated, use a glycerin free cleaner or isopropyl alcohol to clean things up.

Listen other human, one of the biggest reasons I love this site is because of its open mindedness and negative attitude towards bigotry and discrimination.

The fact that she exploded on you might be cause for concern. I think you should try to have a loving, honest conversation with her where you both talk equally."
tifu,3dsxva,hooploopdoop,6,Sun Jul 19 04:22:59 2015 UTC,Contact her doctor with your concerns. Any reputable doctor will take what you have to say seriously.
tifu,3dsxva,bosefius,2,Sun Jul 19 03:55:46 2015 UTC,IANAD but maybe there are different less narcoticy (not a word I don't think) meds she could try. I have a friend with some serious back pain (not sure what kind and IANAD) but they took muscle relaxants because they didn't like how the Percocet made then groggy. Seemed like they worked? I don't really know. I do agree an honest and loving conversation might be in order with her first. Just maybe explaining you were worried and not accusing her of anything IMO
tifu,3dsxva,Techitch87,2,Sun Jul 19 07:54:20 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't she just try to find a way to keep the oxy scrip? It'll be months of her being irritable and trying to get it back or get the fix elsewhere.  Which I guess would be solid evidence of addiction but you could get it quicker by being observant.  Does she take more than prescribed or run out before a refill? +does that affect her mood?  Does she take the pills in any other way than prescribed by the doctor? (Snorting, injection)  Does she take many naps, sleep excessively or pass-out?  These could be signs of abuse, and if left untreated could plague the remainder of your marriage (and then some)."

About what went through my mind. At 1st i thought that i was having a sex dream. I awoke because it felt SUPER good. She had her hands in my shorts, giving me a handie, then i panicked a bit, i was so close to finishing.  After all that, and her refusing to leave, i just got kind of pissed. She didnt want to leave, i felt like I had no power to make her leave. I couldnt even call my fiancee and tell her, because of how i was awoken.  So I decided to just wait her out. It was always in the back of my mind that something was going to happen that i cant take back, that i would regret forever."

I was TALKING to 3 girls. There was plenty of time for him to speak up. He just wanted to play the hero.  Any rational person speaks 1st."
tifu,3dugn8,whosthebear13,5,Sun Jul 19 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"Any rational person speaks first? That's pretty bold from a fucking loser with a shit sense of humor trying to pick girls up by pretending to spike their drinks. Also seeing someone spike a drink is absolutely a reason to lay someone out and I honestly wouldn't give a shit how many of your ""friends"" were there. Youre lucky all that happened was that you got hit, there are people that would literally kill someone for seeing them do that. Quit trying to justify that what you did was ok and that you didnt deserve what you got."

She could have just fucked and sucker her brains out and then cried rape so she didn't feel like such a fucking slut.  Also, only a pussy sucker punches someone."

tifu,3dugn8,DrinksWhileRedditing,5,Sun Jul 19 17:49:13 2015 UTC,How do you not see that what you did is so fucked up? You're a special kind of stupid.   Why the fuck did you think that a girl would want to go home with you after you pretend to spike her drink? You're a fucking coward. No gentleman pretends to roofie somebody.
tifu,3dugn8,somnodoc,-7,Sun Jul 19 20:41:33 2015 UTC,"Did you not read it? I never said it wasn't fucked up, or stupid. The whole point of daring someone to do something is that it's fucked up and stupid.  The girl would have totally went home with me. Not because of the joke. but because she didn't notice the joke. Since she never noticed the prank,  it was almost like I never played the prank."
tifu,3dugn8,getdowntonite,2,Sun Jul 19 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"Lucky for you it was just a punch , and trying to justify that since you people outnumbered them is just idiotic .

tifu,3dsa4u,rose_garden1992,3,Sat Jul 18 23:41:36 2015 UTC,"Yes you did FU. Big time. Be it people or animals it's generally not a good idea to dish out medical advice especially anything involving pills/fluids without talking to a medical professional. Yes I am aware of how expensive emergency medical veterinary care is. I've had a few older animals over the years, but they were a part of my family and deserved whatever professional care I could give them.  I'm assuming that you've already apologized to your friend and that they are quite angry with you. There's not a lot you can do to rectify the situation at the moment except to maybe give your friend some space. I am afraid I don't know if there's anything I can say to make you feel better, but at least you won't ever make the same fu again.  Rest in peace Kitty <3  (I am happy to hear that your cat made a full recovery though)  Edit: forgot to add that maybe the best thing to take away from a screw up is the knowledge that you'll never do it again.  If you are still talking with your friend then just be there for whatever support they need."
tifu,3dsa4u,Keica,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:50 2015 UTC,My friend isn't outwardly angry with me (I'm sure they are inwardly) but I absolutely am with myself. It's a horrible fu and I will never forgive myself for it and just keep all of my ideas so myself when it comes to what could make a medical situation better.   I just wanted to help but I absolutely made everything 100 times worse.
tifu,3dsa4u,ThunderBow98,2,Sun Jul 19 00:06:53 2015 UTC,I guess you could say you... Killed the cat? Ba dum tsss Too soon?
tifu,3dsa4u,LongTermNEET,2,Sat Jul 18 23:43:59 2015 UTC,That's how I feel. I feel horribly guilty for giving her that uneducated advice. I was trying to save her a couple hundred dollars because vets are obnoxiously expensive for emergency visits. Now I know not to just give advice because it worked for one animal. I didn't even know cats could have heart problems like that.

tifu,3dnlqf,TightAnalOrifice789,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:23:43 2015 UTC,"Irrational fear. I had a bad experience in a hospital when I was perhaps five or six years old, and since then, medicine in general makes me uncomfortable if it involves anything other than a thermometer or a stethoscope. I manage to keep it at bay and face it when I have to, but even on a TV, I'll close my eyes and mute the sound if there's anything surgical.   When I said vaccines, I meant needles in general. I'll change that, it's confusing, given all the trends at the moment. Thx."

White collar is more office based and revolves around the management side without getting your hands dirty, money, paperwork etc. You would be surprised how much paperwork a 100+ mill project has.  And the girls that they tend to hire do tend to be pretty good looking, just slightly above average in most cases though, because it's predominately male dominated industry I can imagine it's because a boss has taken a liking to how you look.

Data shows that chiropractic is ineffective in treating basically anything, except for chronic lower back pain for which it has a minor effect - one that is identical to massage.  Edit: For reference, infos.   Chiropractic was invented by D. D. Palmer, Sep 18, 1895 when he adjusted the spine of a deaf man and allegedly restored his hearing (a claim that is highly implausible based on what we know of anatomy). Based on this one case, Palmer decided that all disease was due to subluxation: 95% to subluxations of the spine and 5% to subluxations of other bones.  The rationale for chiropractic hinges on three postulates:   Bones are out of place Bony displacements cause nerve interference Manipulating the spine replaces the bones, removing the nerve interference and allowing Innate (a vitalistic life force) to restore health.   There is no credible evidence to support any of these claims."

Of course, without having been there in person it's difficult to judge the situation and his gf would probably provide a different account of what happened.  Still, how often do we say to other people who say they are in pain that it's not that bad, that it'll pass? In my experience, quite often. Only when a) there's blood, b) the pain is very severe or c) the pain doesn't go away we become concerned. Since his gf didn't stay with him c) wasn't a factor and b) wasn't the case (based on the story provided by OP). And you always have to consider that they had done the exact same thing in the past multiple times, so it's not unusual to believe that it couldn't have been that bad."

When I back crack my wife, I essentially pull her up by her arms, offloading the weight of her upper body from the lower back where ballet took its toll.

How can he look into his girlfriend's tearful face and not be concerned whatsoever, and continue to think she's just being pissy all the way until proven wrong?  OP should seriously think about his attitude and not just think ""It was a mistake, why won't she talk to me?""   Last time I ever crack a back for someone   The real mistake here was ignoring/belittling her feelings, which is often the part that bothers women the most. She's hurt pretty badly which is enough to get anyone angry, but to have her feelings trampled on like that is probably what keeps her from forgiving him faster.

It'd be like fighting with your brother (something you always do as stated by OP) and then you knock your brother down as usual. Then he won't get up. So imagine that you just knocked him down and all looks normal. He starts saying I'm hurt and I think that I broke my arm. A younger person may go into denial.   Ok. The other side of the fence is as everybody pointed out. In the little brother example I used, if your arm is broken and someone is saying that you are all good regardless of the fact that you have never been hurt like that ever (lets say 12 years of messing around), you are going to be like I'm fucking hurt and you want me o get up and keep messing around.

You're treating fuckups like OP's lack of medical training and disagreements like they're actual deliberately abusive attempts at gaslighting, and it's that kind of shitty dilution that demeans actual abuse and makes people take it less seriously.   He dismissed her pain, no matter how you slice it.   He did something she not only specifically asked him to do, but had asked for multiple times before. The problem is he's massively larger than her and has no medical training. Confusion and poorly worded reassurances are not the kind of pathological abusiveness you're trying to make it out to be.  Listen I get that you really feel the need to justify that shoehorn you bought from Prime Day but you're not helping anyone with this kind of tumblr psychology which I would almost be willing to bet you only apply when it's M>F."

Now maybe you're not a goddamn moron like all of my former criminal defense clients, the odds aren't good, but I'm going to try to help anyways and at least for right now it is really goddamn simple:   CEASE ALL COMMUNICATIONS WITH HER OR ANYONE CONNECTED TO HER.  this means, her, her friends, her mom, any other family, the cashier at her favorite smoothie shop, EVERYONE. Zero contact through any medium. Do not initiate contact, do not respond to any contact.    And that's it.  As of right now you don't need to run off and get an attorney because 1. Lawyers are expensive (my hourly rate would make you choke). 2. There is nothing an attorney can do for you at this stage.   That said. It would not hurt to start looking around for an attorney, see who is out there in your area, what kind of work they do, and maybe get a general feel for what you can afford. The last thing you want to do is what I like to call ""shopping under fire"", where you are trying to find an attorney at the same time your life is falling apart, do the initial legwork now so that you're ready when all hell breaks loose.  As a last note. I don't care how much you love her, how much she would never do this to you, blah blah blah butt fuck, whatever. A party connected with her is threatening both your freedom and livelihood. You either take that seriously and act seriously or you can say hi to a lot of my former clients in prison.

I'm not sure an abusive boyfriend would post about purposefully hurting his girlfriend, especially in a random scenario like this. With abusive situations the abuser would most likely be trying to brush this off and not bring it up. Especially not on the Internet. It's easier for the abuser to seem to have a flawless relationship than admit they are too rough at all."

tifu,3dn7eu,begaston,18,Fri Jul 17 20:52:21 2015 UTC,I've never done the forward facing back pop. My fiance normally has me face away from him and I cross my arms over my chest when he picks me up to pop me. We've been doing that forever and I've never had ribs crack. She and her mother need to chill the hell out though...no reason to call the cops over a simple mistake!
tifu,3dn7eu,h-jay,6,Fri Jul 17 18:57:49 2015 UTC,"That's more like it. It places your spinal column in tension, enlarges spacing between the vertebrae, and allows any dislocated stuff that to slip back into place. That's how I get my wife's disc to pop back. Sometimes some slight twisting is involved too, but this only once I've established and are maintaining tension (as in: am pulling her up by her arms)."
tifu,3dn7eu,begaston,5,Fri Jul 17 20:46:10 2015 UTC,Yep that is exactly how we do it! Sadly I haven't been able to pop it for months because I'm pregnant and I don't want to harm the baby...I'm pretty sure after the baby gets here I'm going to get the best spinal alignment of my life!
tifu,3dn7eu,Triggerbee,2,Sat Jul 18 03:23:05 2015 UTC,"Ok i will try to explain this, When cracking someones spine all you have to do is face her/his back tell them to cross their arms in front of them and then ""hug"" them from behind and proceed arcing your back so you lift them with an arc.   No more broken ribs!"

tifu,3dn7eu,Yesitmatches,-1,Sat Jul 18 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"In his defense, he probably didn't think he cracked her ribs and slipped her disk because he didn't think he squeezed that hard. If it is something he has done for\in front of her before, she knew how he did it. Another person does not know the pain you are feeling. Should OP feel like shit, yes, it is natural he hurt someone he cared about and then didn't listen to her when she said it hurt. Was it an accident? Yes. Abuse and cops being called, no."
tifu,3dn7eu,Harmoniche,2,Sat Jul 18 17:50:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the point you're trying to make? Even if he didn't think he cracked her ribs he literally saw her in pain and dismissed it like she was being a baby. He even described her to be a child.   There is no justification for that--he saw her in pain and just ignored it. You're like, ""in his defense"" but you can't defend him for acting like a prick about someone else's feelings, emotionally and physically. So when he hurts someone because he didn't think he hurt someone that bad, it's reasonable to not acknowledge it? That's what you're saying to me, lol.   As for the mother, the gf asked why he's so rough with her and to me that implies he's rough with her on a regular basis. I'm not saying he's abusive but that may be the conclusion her mother has come to and she's just protecting her child."
tifu,3dn7eu,Yesitmatches,0,Sat Jul 18 22:12:55 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that some people have a low pain tolerance and the rough with her doesn't mean he is smacking her around and being abusive. My... well I don't know what to call him... so basically the guy that I see everyone once and a while and am completely in love with but we are not officially together because I live in VA and he is in MO, gets a rough with me everyone once and a while, meaning he will hug me a little to hard or tickle me a little to hard, but here is the thing, I am 165 lbs, 5'6"" and he is 360-380 lbs and 5'10"". Sometimes his normal touch is just a little firmer that it should be, just because he has so much mass. Also, he didn't call her a child, he compared her face to a child. That moment before having a complete meltdown that a child has when you take their toy or they fall off a bike. Would it be any different if he was describing a joyful event and said she was like a kid in a candy store?"
tifu,3dn7eu,Harmoniche,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't say he was abusive either, but I'm saying that what she said implied that he's usually rough with her (most likely by accident) and that would give the mother grounds to be worried about something like abuse.   I literally fucking said: I'm not saying he's abusive but that may be the conclusion her mother has come to and she's just protecting her child.  I don't even care about your statement about anyone's ""pain tolerance"" because frankly you're justifying the fact that he completely dismissed her being in pain like she was fine just because she could potentially be only a little bit hurt. Not everyone has a low pain tolerance, anyway. If you see your partner is in pain why is it someone's first instinct to tell them, ""nah you're fine"" instead of being concerned? Do you not see what is wrong with that? Even then--if he thought about what he was just doing maybe it would've occurred to him that something could potentially go seriously wrong? If you're trying to crack a bone and you hear it elsewhere (if you were cracking your back it wouldn't sound the same as cracking your ribs, I assume) and then someone doubles over in pain, gee, wonder what happened. I'm just don't understand why that is acceptable.   Sorry the ""like"" got cut out. It was supposed to be, ""like a child"" and no it wouldn't be different. It wouldn't be as bad probably but why not just say ""like someone who just won the lottery"" or something along those lines--why does he need to equate his own girlfriend to a child via comparison?"
tifu,3dn7eu,Yesitmatches,0,Mon Jul 20 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are really butthurt over this. Have you been abused in the past by someone you love? Have you been beaten until you can barely stand, only to have them come back after they get done and apologize saying it will not happen again? Have you had to fear for your life, fear that one day you wouldn't survive the next one? I can clearly see (from what is written) that OP is not that guy, and that he is just an unthinking young man. You are expecting an unthinking young man to think that is like expecting an apple to be an orange.  Furthermore, the facial expression between a lottery winner and a baby that is a about to start bawling is completely different. Could he have explained it differently, maybe, however the figurative description does not mean he is calling her a child. However, since you do not seem to have the ability to understand basic concepts of writing, I will no longer be trying to explain that to you."
tifu,3dn7eu,Harmoniche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:28 2015 UTC,"For starters, yeah I have been abused. Not awfully physically, but I endured years of emotional, verbal and sexual abuse, thanks. From what you are saying I honestly don't think you read a word of what I said. I'm butthurt about your inability to read, not over your opinion. Besides, what I'm expecting is common sense and common courtesy from someone who claims to care about another human being which is what everyone else here is so incredulous about--that lack of care and consideration.  Firstly, I implied that I thought he wasn't abusive. I specifically said: I didn't say he was abusive. I said that his mother might have secondhand evidence that can easily give her the means to think he was potentially abusive because a lot of parents tend to jump to conclusions  in that respect. Secondly, I was playing off of the comparison that you made. A child can become extremely happy over the smallest things, even candy so I do not think the comparison to someone winning the lottery was such a gigantic stretch. Making a comparison to a child is not only completely unnecessary but rude. In that context it appeared to be the equivalent of calling her a child.  Before you make accusations about me and my life as well as my opinions maybe you should take the time to read what I'm saying. I don't think he's a bad person but I sure as hell think OP is a shitty boyfriend.   P.S. You say I have the inability to understand the basic concepts of writing but you actually managed to misconstrue everything I wrote.   Since you have so much ""experience with abuse"" maybe you should understand how people who have experienced abuse and even people who haven't would be so fucking upset at his complete dismissal of her feelings and well being."
tifu,3dn7eu,Yesitmatches,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:58 2015 UTC,"And as someone who experienced physical abuse, it pissed me off when people throw mediocre secondhand evidence of abuse and don't gather a full story, as her mother did, because it weakens/desensitizes the claims of those actually abused. Which causes police to write it off as them being an active child. Yes, I shouldn't have rode my dirtbike after the night, but the video clearly showed me landing on my back and my wrist never touched anything, yet I had a spiral fracture of  two bones in my wrist and in both bones of my arm."
tifu,3dn7eu,Harmoniche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"Cool, if you're pissed at the mother then don't give me your shitty rant as if I was the person in question claiming him to be an abused. You got defensive when I was simply explaining the possible mentality behind pressing charges. I didn't say that she did use that as evidence I just said that she might think that and be worried and at least she gives a damn, unlike him, or maybe she just wants an excuse to throw charges at him.   What are you even talking about? My god, please proof read your responses before you send them. It's literally jibberish."

tifu,3dn7eu,thepoondocs,8,Sat Jul 18 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"He did do it against her will. She asked him to crack her back and he broke two of her ribs and slipped a disc. That's not what she asked for.  If you ask someone to give you a boost to reach something and they throw you up in the air, they're doing it against your will. They used more force than you asked them to, you got hurt. That's not your fault, it's theirs, even if it was a mistake."
tifu,3dn7eu,Alpha_Male_Other_Guy,2,Sat Jul 18 03:09:17 2015 UTC,"As much as OP sounds like an insensitive asshole, I have to disagree with you on this.  He attempted to repeat the same manuever he has performed - upon request by her - several times in the past.  He didn't do anything against her will.  She didn't specifically say, ""and make sure you don't hurt me,"" but obviously there is a risk since he has no qualifications to be manipulating bones."
tifu,3dn7eu,thepoondocs,0,Sat Jul 18 13:23:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's splitting hairs to argue about whether he did it ""against her will"" -- I think we just have different ideas of what that phrase means.  But we can all agree that he wasn't trying to hurt her, according to this description. But the fact that he did, and she (implicitly) didn't want him to, still makes the injury his fault and not hers. She shouldn't have to say ""and make sure you don't hurt me,"" that's implied. She was telling him to do the same maneuver he did several times in the past, just like he did it several times in the past. It's safe to assume he has never broken her ribs doing this before, so we know that she wasn't asking for that."
tifu,3dn7eu,Alpha_Male_Other_Guy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that she had a conscious role; she asked OP to perform the maneuver.

You mention that you think you didn't even squeeze her that hard.   2) Immediately uses the line ""why are you so rough with me?"" This sounds like a pre-prepared line. If someone gets hurt, first reaction should normally be ""I think I'm seriously hurt, maybe call a doctor."" Not immediate blame.   3) She DRIVES off in a ""rage"" but suddenly can't sit up 10 minutes later?   4) And now mommy wants to call the police? What the fuck?

tifu,3dlr10,AceTheIceman,4,Sat Jul 18 13:15:32 2015 UTC,"I had a very similar fuck up when I was a senior in highschool.   My anatomy class (3 guys including me, and probably 30 girls) was taking a trip to a cadaver lab at a university. We get there, and a professor who is in charge of the lab begins giving us a speech about how serious this is and that cadavers were once real living people and that we needed to be respectful of them. I shouldn't have even been standing by the two other guys as we're really good friends, but I didn't expect anything to come out of it. Anyways, it was all going well until she decided to introduce her assistant. The professor says ""I'd like to let my assistant Sam Semen tell you a few more things before we enter the lab"". It was probably something like Seaman, but it was pronounced like semen   As soon as we heard it, all three of us looked at each other and tried our hardest to hold back our laughter. I must have bitten a hole in my tongue because I was trying so hard and this clearly wasn't the time for laughter. However, my efforts failed, and I let out the loudest, most improperly timed laugh ever. Mind you, this was in the middle of an empty hallway and everyone was completely silent. As soon as I laughed, everyone turned and looked right at me, and the professor didn't let me go in the lab because I wasn't taking it seriously. My anatomy teacher acted like it was no big deal, but she ripped me a new one when we were on the bus. Oh, and everyone who went into the lab got 200 points on their grade card. Guess who didn't get 200 points and ended up with a C for the quarter? Me.   TLDR: Went to a cadaver lab in highschool, laughed at the name Sam Semen, got the worst grade of my high school career."

Everyone around us was glaring at us, a few people who knew the man were crying, my grandparents were giving us the death-glare, and my parents weren't any help, because they tried to stop us but just ended up laughing as well.

tifu,3ds4d4,Fuegofucker,5,Sat Jul 18 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"The worst part is that it seems like it completely blindsided you.  If someone is this impressionable by others, generally it isn't a good sign.   I'm assuming you're both young.  It takes a while for someone to realize what exactly they want and who they are.    Who knows, maybe down the line she'll realize she made a mistake, or maybe she won't.  The only thing you can control are your actions at this point.  Breakups suck.  No denying that.  But, the silver lining to this is the experience.  Sure some couples are able to have a loving relationship while having differing opinions on religion, politics, etc., but when they play a large enough role in ones life, such as someone going on a church retreat or a political rally, it's tough for some people to put a damper on those beliefs when the person they share a bed with is on the other side of the fence.    It's all part of maturing.  It sounds like she just didn't/doesn't know what she wanted/wants.  It was nothing you did or could have done to change the situation.  Hopefully the next person you're involved with will be on the same page regarding your beliefs."
tifu,3ds4d4,zydrateaddict23,3,Sat Jul 18 23:36:53 2015 UTC,Yea atheist and Christians don't mix well relationship wise. I tried dating a an atheist. Failed pretty badly.

tifu,3ds4d4,Keepsgoing,5,Sun Jul 19 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"As mean as this sounds, I'm glad she broke up with you. You don't need some radically religious person in your life. Just say for a moment you guys got married. Now you're basically stuck with her and she becomes this radical person. She's basically making your life a living nightmare with her religiousness basically being forced onto you  Plus that's some pretty shitty communication - so much for the understanding person you said she was lol"

tifu,3ds4d4,Hetalianforlife,2,Sun Jul 19 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"It's her religion. You say you respect her and what she believes in. If that's the case then you can move on.  If she believed that her God talked to her, then that's her belief. Sometimes people believe that their God talked to them and they follow what they believe.  I'm not trying to be mean. :/ But that sucks man. Perhaps you will find someone who is a little bit more compatible."

You deserve better and that is no doubt. You didn't screw up. Your just with the wrong person. I hope you get over the fact that she dumped you for god just shows that she would not put her life on the line for you if it was god taking your life. Please don't be upset. If it makes anything better here's a quote from my fav. Show that I hope you can watch or have already watched    If you talk to god your religous if god talks to you, your psychotic house m.d.

tifu,3dla60,MangaMaven,19,Fri Jul 17 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much it. Ambien can cause you to see things, ""differently"" and greatly impairs your cognitive logic. 99% of the time, it was never an issue for me as I went to bed immediately. 1% of the time it would cause me to act strangely and do silly things before I made it to bed. Now that I have had some sleep studies, I no longer use those types of sleep aides as we found a much safer and more effective medication that works well for brain injury (TBI - Restless Leg Syndrome/Periodic Limb Movement Disorder) related sleep disorders. I take a powerful muscle relaxer now and it works much better without the worry of making a fool of myself."

The conversation was along the lines of him asking me if I remembered the time that I peed on him in the shower and him then peeing on me. I told him that never in the realm of possibility, did that ever happen. He argued with me and said that it did and that he wanted to pee on me in the shower again. He was completely out of it.

She said she vaguely remembers laughing and reaching for an electric razor but upon waking she thought it had been a dream, until she saw the hair everywhere. Two things made this less terrible than it would've been for most women:  1. She's a very butch lesbian, so she already had short hair and wasn't crushed by lack of hair, even if it was ALL of her hair, and 2. It was winter, so she was able to wear a hat most of the time, and looked no different from before as long as she had a hat on.

tifu,3dko9h,never_assume,116,Fri Jul 17 11:02:30 2015 UTC,I broke my toe once then went to the hospital for an x-ray. It cost me $6.00 total. $4 for parking and $2 for a bag if chips. Because Canada
tifu,3dko9h,DocPantsOnHead,42,Fri Jul 17 12:41:26 2015 UTC,I hate it when the clinics charge for parking! Do they think we're made of money or something? Fucking health care costs in this country are ridiculous amirite?
tifu,3dko9h,Novazon,9,Fri Jul 17 13:13:07 2015 UTC,You might have. The differences between a broken toe and a severely bruised toe are almost meaningless. The MD can't even do anything for you unless it's the big toe most of the time.

It shows that you were trying to do something nice for her and made an honest mistake... not like you went hunting for poon and messed up. It was for her.  Have her* sister nearby (not next to you because that is gonna be extra weird, she is going to think you had sex or something terrible) so she can back you up in how mortified you were... also... your fucked up toe could help.  Either way, your girl deserves to know. You would want to.  I truly hope the best for you, you seem like a good dude.  Edit: explanation why you should open with that.  Edit: changed your to her. lel"

Also, if she complains about you never doing anything romantic, you now have a trump card to play against her."

tifu,3dko9h,eatingisoverrated,26,Fri Jul 17 12:04:37 2015 UTC,She may have been angry initially because she thought OP was lying about it being an accident. Beyond that it's entirely possible that she is angry at the situation but not angry at OP.

tifu,3dko9h,helpinghat,46,Fri Jul 17 05:52:38 2015 UTC,"Okay I seriously don't understand why this would piss off a wife. If my spouse came home to our house that normally only contains my body, and got into the shower with the person they thought was me but was really my sneaky doppelganger I didn't tell my spouse was coming over, I would be somewhere between ""baaaaahahaha!"", ""OMG I am so sorry!!"", and ""lawlzzzz that's what you get for sneak attacking in the shower."" Now if they'd STAYED and enjoyed it, or never told me, that's when I'd get mad. Maybe it's just a lack of trust? Would the cars outside have been super obvious? I just don't get this mad business."
tifu,3dko9h,icaptain,24,Fri Jul 17 12:18:12 2015 UTC,I seriously don't understand why this would piss off a significant other.   Because emotions > logic

Can't help but feel a little weird about her being PISSED about it.. as there's really nothing in it but an honest mistake.  On top of that, you came out and told her which you didn't ever have to do.  Idk.  Hope the best for you man, maybe she'll wake up tomorrow and be over it.  Girls gotta feel them emotions sometimes whether it's rational or not.  I'm sure she's super worried you're attracted to her sister now."
tifu,3dko9h,puddinginmango,121,Fri Jul 17 06:25:18 2015 UTC,"im not attracted to her. i wont lie though. after sitting and thinking about it rationally, 19 feels a bit different than 26 in the soft spots. It might be a bit more awkward between her sister and i though."

tifu,3dko9h,zykromB,45,Fri Jul 17 11:00:20 2015 UTC,"Something similar happened to me once. My friends had a bachelor and bachelorette party where the guys and girls went and partied in separate towns. Us guys were staying at one friends house, the girls at my house. Fast forward to like 4:00 AM and there's no couch space at my buddy's place and I'm not drunk enough to sleep on the floor. I decide to just go home. I creep in my front door to not wake any of the girls headed to my room. For some reason my wife is sleeping on the bigass couch in the living room. I figure she let the bachelorette sleep in our bed or whatever . So I smoothly mount my wife on the couch and start waking her up for some lovin when she starts screaming and freaking out. Turns out to not be my wife at all, but some girl ive never met before wearing a set of my wife's pajamas. She freaks out as do I, the whole house of girls wake up and walk into me in my underwear and some terrified girl screaming at me. One of my many Larry David moments."

Katie said, holding, kissing her neck.  But at the end of the summer, why not get it. She is my sister then after activities. But they are all equal. But too big I think I've found the difference. Shortly after taking that excuse. Also, it can be used soon run your fingers is not the goal.  Then, it was time. And as the number of seats have been fixed, as said, and her sister at the grocery store in the bathroom.

I had just got home fro work and i see my gf in the kitchen so i sneak up on her real smooth like... grabbed some booty, started to kiss her ear... then she turned around with the most terrified look ive ever seen on someones face. It was her sister.We both looked at each other like ""WTF!"" It took me a second to realize what had just happened. Then I turn around and my gf is laughing her ass off, she was like ""I saw the whole thing go down and I was going to say something but I figured this would be funnier."" She wasn't mad, but I felt terrible. In my defense her sister was wearing all her clothes and it was pretty much impossible to tell them apart from behind."

Outcome 1:she is pissed at first but gets over it and knows it's a mistake=your good  Outcome 2:she gets pissed and doesn't get over it and leaves you and the sister really has nothing to do with you=you dodged a bullet cause she crazy=good for you  Option 3: same as 2 but sister is into you and it all works out for you except Christmas and Thanksgiving=you avoided crazy and got the newer model=good for you  Option 4:she doesn't get over it but doesn't leave you and constantly gives you grief until you leave her or die=bad cause even if you nutt up and leave her crazy ass you lose a fiancé/wife and had to deal with the verbal abuse  So here is hoping for #1 or #3"

My wife's son is autistic, and I had to learn a lot to help them to cope with his condition, and we as a family attend to a psychologist that helps us to better direct the boy (we tried a lot of things, even TEACCH). I cherished the possibility of being a psychologist myself earlier in life, but ended being a Systems Analyst instead. I delved into other studies too, Parapsychology (even attending to Oscar Quevedo's classes), Protectionism (attending to Waldo Vieira's classes), Spiritism (actively working as a doctrinator, e.g. talking to supposed spirits that manifested trough mediums), Demonology (Frs. Rufus Pereira, Gabriele Amorth, Elias Vela and José Antonio Fortea - all of them official, authorized Catholic Exorcists - Summa Daemoniaca is a surprisingly lucid book) and now I intend to become a Catholic Deacon (but only after I get a Theology degree).  I know reasonably well both sides of the coin, the humanistic/skeptic and the spiritual/parapsychological, and I respect both. I don't pretend to know the ultimate truth about such happenings, I don't take any opinion for something certain. I had my own experiences (OOBE, lucid dreams, visions, clarividence, telepathy, telekinesis, transcommunication both with and without a medium - I'm talking about the ones I was the ""sujet"", not the observer) and despite having no way to prove myself to anyone and even conceding the possibility of being batshit crazy, as long as I'm in peace and doing no harm to other people, doing good deeds here and there and being a good guy in general, what matters is how I take my life forward. If I can see it under a positive light the ultimate truth doesn't matter at all."

As the rice get in everywhere it soaks up the water and expands, when it's inside a USB slot or behind a key on a keyboard, it'll fuck that shit up by expanding and damaging anything delicate. If it gets inside the cooling vents it can actually crack serious components internally like the pcb in worst case scenarios. It's best just to leave it in a dry place for two days."

It's a valid opinion to hold.   The other would require a pretty intimate knowledge of Kanye as a human being, something which even the biggest Yeezy stans would not be able to claim. I'm guessing that you have next to no knowledge of Kanye's personality, so you are stating an opinion which has no experiential basis.   That is a textbook example of prejudice.

tifu,3dp3wy,Cajete,2,Sat Jul 18 03:27:46 2015 UTC,"Tuesday must have been a day for bedroom mishaps :/ my husband and I were trying to get it on (I'm 38 weeks pregnant) and wound up in doggy style, which is my favorite position. Well, there was so much pressure in my vagina from being super pregnant that I suggested we switch to anal (also pregnant anal sex is awesome!). Husband agreed and proceeded to get everything all lubed up. He wasn't at the right angle when he went to penetrate, so I reached back to lend a helping hand....well, that was a mistake. Pregnancy and prenatal vitamins make my nails grow like crazy, and there was so much lube back there that my hand slipped, and I accidentally scratched my husband's penis. It was bad, I actually drew blood. Needless to say, sexy times were immediately over. His penis is mostly healed now, but I still feel like shit about it. :("
tifu,3dp3wy,MrsTroy,2,Sat Jul 18 14:07:01 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to risk the occasional scratch for a pregnant wife that steps up to the plate like that. Even great warriors get hurt in battle.

If it was rates per hour then I can see it like an escort (after some thinking). Either they were laughing because of something else or they have 12 year old minds and think of everything being sexual. ""Haha! They have a price per (unit)! That means it can be anything like an escort!"".  TL;DR His Rate Per Month = Gym's R/M due to his representation, they think even the slightest relation to sex is funny, and owns a gym full of kids"

tifu,3dktut,Nugulus,13,Fri Jul 17 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, lets dive into my creeper days and see if I can find you this chick.   First thing, you know her name, we're off to a good start, even better if you know her full name. Next, you know her interests, the ones based off yours at least. That can help. Now lets get creepy.  Search for her on Facebook by first and last name and see what comes up. Might be hard, but might work. Key Points, do you know what school she went to, what towns she's from or where she works? Key terms added in might help your search.   Next, heres where it gets weird, scour interest pages based off what she likes on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Example, shes in Tokyo to see a show, go to that concerts/venue/play/whatever it is Facebook page and see whats on their feed. Sounds nuts, but I once found a girl I met at a concert by going to the bands facebook page and scrolling till I saw her post. Yeah, dark days my friends, dark days.  Now since we're on the whole social media stalkerverse let me ask you this. You're in Tokyo right. Did she say where she was going, what she was doing, places she planned to visit, hotel she was staying in? Well then you go to those instagram accounts, you check their tweets, and you delve into hashtags and see if some sweet girl named Anya maybe stopped by today and posted a picture. Should be able to recognize her. She's the girl who's pretending to be happy while her hearts breaking inside because you never called. So you better get on this.   Also what airport did you fly out of? What airport did you fly into? I bet both those places have Geotags and Geotags means any photos taken in that location given those geotags get posted on the internets. I dont know about you, but most girls I know LOVE to take pictures of themselves in the airport.  Everyone tracks themselves these days, we live in a self-indulgent world where we are constantly bragging about how cool we are. So if you know enough info and you have enough time, I'm sure you can find her.  TL;DR - Stalk her on the internet"

tifu,3dktut,mr_pa300,6,Fri Jul 17 09:16:44 2015 UTC,"When I program I usually make 1 back up but that's a just in case, or I set the program to make an auto save backup every 5 minutes and I feel good about that"

Keep going back to that and any other source and maybe she will post pics from Japan, unless the account(s) are private which gives you less to go on. Good luck and God speed."

tifu,3dktut,aykayPKT,5,Fri Jul 17 12:00:47 2015 UTC,K I've found a picture of an actress that basically looks pretty damn similar  Here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Kreuk  Anya looks like a 6 or 7 year younger version of her with lighter brown hair. Same general face except for she has a wee bit more defined eyebrows.   Other than that her tits were probably a little bigger than average and her ass was fucking amazing but not big.  She also probably had longer hair than the actress I linked.

Those are two of the most vulnerable places for a person to be in, and women are constantly being told to fear sexual assault, so if they think their bf is still out of town, the first reaction to being awakened by groping isn't going to be ""Oh my bf is here, what a sweet surprise!"" it's going to be ""Oh shit, someone broke in, I'm about to get raped"""

All you can do is take care of yourself, get outside, take up hobbies, get a damn beer at a bar instead of sitting inside! As far as work/career.. put your best foot forward until it lands you something, not for a year, or months , or 2 years.. UNTIL it lands you something. I applied to 28 jobs before I got one worth it's salt. My best friend worked after graduation for his dad for 3 years doing shit work he wasn't happy with. I convinced him to start applying for other stuff just to see what happens. Now he is an account rep for Coke and he loves it. You cannot possibly rely on someone else to keep you going, you've gotta do that on your own. Be your best self and you will attract like minded people who will support you and push you forward.

My little brother once had a similar issue except his charges were dropped due to a mistaken identity but the moment they did background they'd pull the offers. Turns out the DA never ""closed the case"" or filed the right papers. A warrant had been issued for his arrest that he didn't even know about. He spent some money and had a background check run on himself. Took a long time to fix but now his record is accurately clean again.   Also, some jobs never even look at an application past credentials. I'd suggest bringing it up in the interview if it is the legit record. Better to know before the offer that you're not getting hired than after you've changed everything for the position."

tifu,3do5kx,troublingsmile,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"I read it right that you do have the felony background. That wasn't what I was questioning. I honestly just thought maybe they saw something worse than what you plead to. I know HR is a bitch for most companies. I was just hoping I could offer advice that may potentially help in the future. Maybe it would help to as soon as you get the offer get the number for that HR manager and give them a call. Or even an email alerting them. It could be something as simple as the manager hiring you never told HR about the felony and because they probably didn't read the application felt surprised by ""new information"" resulting in a canceled offer. I'm just trying to give a fresh set of eyes for you and hopefully an idea of something you haven't tried. In my opinion the only time real fuck ups happen are when we choose to wallow because we don't see a way out. Didn't want you to really fuck up."
tifu,3do5kx,troublingsmile,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:46:13 2015 UTC,"No I got a copy of the background check from both support.com and WOW!. They say F3-Endangerment in October 2010.   They make it impossible to track down HR. Everything is automated now days. The supervisor who hired me knew about the F3 and said he thought it would be okay with HR (I think he talked to someone).  It's hard to see a way out. I currently work in IT contracting but it's been a bad couple of months for me. I had steady work for 3or4 months. Now I got nothing and it's bad. I'm back on food stamps and semi-homeless.  I work at Temp agencies but get fired when the company likes me and goes to bring me in full time. Then when I apply for a great job, I get a job offer only to have it taken away because of my background."
tifu,3do5kx,jfb3,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:00 2015 UTC,Well sorry that I haven't come up with anything new. Maybe you should talk to a lawyer about local hiring laws or ways to bury the felony.

I didn't want this but I don't see much hope. It's a horrible cycle that I didn't believe existed until now.   When I first got out I tried Support.com. When that didn't work I went to a temp service. I worked my hands raw in a box factory. They liked me and I was constantly helping fix machinery and staying late. One day the owner who walks the factory about once a week, comes by and starts chatting with me. Say he heard a lot about me, yada yada, I tell him about my computer skills. I tell him your network here is open, he ask what I mean. I walk over to a computer terminal on the factory floor, I click the network icon, I start showing him all the computers including his own with open shares. Some with financial information. He says thanks, a week later they have the HR guy come out to the factory floor. He tells me they are having the company that does the IT look into the open shares. He want's to know if I would be a full time IT guy, what would I cost. I tell them I will start at $15 an hour, he takes me to his office and gives me the application. I fill it out, submit it and the next day the temp agency calls and says Creative Packaging has terminated me.   I live in a nasty basement. I don't have any thing to cook with. I live off gas station food with my food stamps card. The food is expensive and it sucks. I do odd computer jobs and odd labor off craigslist, my city isn't big so I don't get much."

Laid down for a half an hour, went to puke and it came out highlighter yellow. I drank some actual water and then passed out. Next morning I go downstairs and tell em what happened, he's like "" YOU DIDNT DRINK THAT DID YOU?! "" I said yea what the fuck was it?!? He replied with ""it was fucking carpet cleaner!!"" I then said ""WHY WOULD IT BE IN A WATER BOTTLE!?"" he went and grabbed it to show that they wrote carpet cleaner on it with a fucking highlighter.. so we all laughed our asses off, smoked an went on with our day.

And given your obvious tongue biting afterward and this post, relax, we have a greater sense of humor and can laugh about it :) so while I recommend you save the voices for a closed circle of close friends, you can rest easy about those 2 guys.

tifu,3dpmlu,RAND0MCHAP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:27:28 2015 UTC,"Indians do get offended by this little quote. In my teens a friend and I were working at a Dunkin Donuts drive thru and he had the bright idea of telling these two indian guys ""thank you come again."" They came into the store clearly upset and demanding to talk to the guy who took their order. My friend saw from the cameras in the back that these two indian gentelmen looked like football players and spoke perfect english. My friend who was a skinny white kid started sobbing and crying haha. We finally just gave them the owner's number and they left. My friend was friends with the owner's family so nothing happened to him; except he knew from then on I could bother him endlessly about it if I wanted."
tifu,3do1gp,Throwaway40132,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"I had similar problems when i was a kid. My parents paid the ""regular"" price for glasses, which was like $200-300 and several times they broke and i had to tape them back together cause i didnt want to tell my parents i broke them.   Once i grew up and had to buy glasses for myself, i realized that the prices of glasses are a pure scam. You can get prescription glasses from sites like zennioptical and other sites for as low as $10 or $12 (and thats the price for the frame and the prescription lenses and a case). Your friend just needs to get his prescription with his PD number and then they can be ordered online. Ive had probably 10 pairs of these cheap glasses and i can tell you that they are no worse quality than the ones i was paying $300 for. So maybe this info will help..."

You get them on facebook them charge a rate in between what you would make and what they actually charge using paypal as the transfer of funds.   A lot of times with internet jobs like this they don't know you on any level so anytime something like this happens they assume loss of income ahead of anything else. Unless they included more info they didn't specifically say why it was inappropriate just that it was. If they didn't think you were a pedo now they're  reading their email thinking your insane and have no idea what you're talking about.
tifu,3do1x8,troublingsmile,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:56:10 2015 UTC,"I thought that at first also.

It's just that why did they wait 2 months to get back to me about this, unless I was reported. Consider this, there is a lot of tutors on the website, I don't think they would have time to go through all of their messagses and ban them for breaking this rule once or twice even though they are consistently bringing in good business for the site.

If it was just some nobody running a bullshit label, the odds of leaning on them to get more information about Young AC and possibly finding him and/or the stolen stuff would be pretty low.

You'd hardly be the first person to lose their prescription; the right thing to do is to phone the police and report them stolen.  Your doctor may write a new prescription to replace them if you have a police report for the theft. Good luck replacing them without a report.

I had a surplus of them at the time because my doctor forgot she had already prescribed them and my boyfriend picked up my medication for me and they gave me an extra bottle so I ended up being fine. And no I don't sell my medication, I know its a federal offense and quite a few people in my town has gotten into trouble for it. I think they assumed I gave them to them then got upset and reported them stolen and tried to shake me into saying I was making it up and get a drug bust or two out of it.

That is why it is important that tenants get their own insurance. You may be the safest person in the world and think you're fine, but when the guy three doors down burns the building down because he fell asleep with a lit cigarette, you are going to be out of luck."
tifu,3djfbz,Inebriated_temptress,5,Thu Jul 16 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"I deal with insurance as well.  It's amazing how many renters (business and residential) think the landlord is responsible. It's always frustrating to hear people say ""well it was in their building, their liable"". I feel like screaming at them, ""your landlord is a for profit company/person who covers themselves and not your valuables!""  I think parents/family/society does a poor job of educating youth on how important getting renters insurance is.  Paying that $200-$500 a year for insurance, could save thousands if your robbed, or a victim of a fire etc."
tifu,3djfbz,scott60561,3,Fri Jul 17 03:06:11 2015 UTC,"I'm currently watching a GoFundMe page for a high school acquaintance who lost everything in an apartment building fire. No insurance and since the fire was accidental (power line fell during a storm) there is no one who is going to pay for the damages.  So instead of paying $15-30 a month on renter's insurance, he is now depending on strangers to rebuild his life."

He lived below the main fire area, but imagine 100,000+ gallons of water flowing through your stuff.

tifu,3dljeo,jhascal23,3,Fri Jul 17 07:36:54 2015 UTC,"For a while there I thought you were going to realize that you had hit the car beside you. You probably should have called nonemergency back. Mistakes happen, but they have your number and, if they went into the building looking for you, someone may have IDed you to the officer. Chances are though that they just left when you weren't out by the car. I know that false 911 reports are illegal, but I'm not sure about nonemergency. Either way though, still could have saved someone some time."
tifu,3dljeo,free_reddit,2,Fri Jul 17 07:13:21 2015 UTC,When they got there and didn't find you they would have had dispatch call you back. If dispatch could not reach you they would have closed the run as unfounded and went back in service. It happens a lot.

tifu,3dljeo,ZippyKitty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:26:10 2015 UTC,"Nonemergency calls like this typically aren't a big deal. Mainly because the cop knows if they get a real emergency they can take that call. Most that will probably happen is the cop saw the similar car, took notes on what he saw then called dispatch and said you weren't there. Expect a call from someone to ask where you were and to make certain nothing was wrong, then maybe a stern call us back and let know. That call will only come if the person you spoke to has a kind heart so it's 50/50.   Biggest worry is if you get pulled you may have established a reputation and they might be a little more strict."

This in turn makes you a better person, boosts your confidence and you get to make a difference in another person's life.   Keep doing it, talk to strangers that you find interesting, give a compliment to those that you think deserve it. Make a difference with a tiny gesture."

You tried and by the sounds of it she would have been interested if it wasn't for her SO. Don't give up. Keep at it. By doing this, you instantly lift yourself above every other guy out there.

I was walking behind her by like 10 feet she ended up living in the same building as me. So when she finally got to the building the rushed in and closed the door behind her and i just walked up unlocked it then just turned and went up a stair case. It was so awkward.

I would have just smiled and told her that her bf is a lucky man. Who knows, maybe she'll break up with him later on and you'll get another chance.

I asked a girl out that had, I thought, been giving me clear signals for weeks.  We worked together and I asked her at work.  Took a lot to build up the nerve.  She told me she would love to say yes but had a boyfriend.  I said cool and moved on, but inside I felt like a total tool.

This is a clear sign you are desirable to girls that you feel are desirable. 3) She respected your attempt enough to give you a clear reason for her rejection.  Think about these things for a while.  Let them soak in.  You did not get rejected, you gained acceptance, however just because the outcome you wanted wasn't what you got, you feel like you failed?  Stupid.  Nothing in life, especially not relationships will ever be black and white like tests in school.  Your real fuck up would be to never try again."

tifu,3dhmqt,break12345,2,Thu Jul 16 15:55:10 2015 UTC,So where did you fuck up?  Read through what you posted and try to find a mistake you made.   You didn't make any.
tifu,3dhmqt,Takseen,2,Thu Jul 16 15:59:58 2015 UTC,"Ouch! Dude, you got of the bus, that wasn't a mistake. There are literally a half dozen times I wish I would have gotten off the bus, and I regret never having done so. Keep getting off the bus, keep chasing your heart!"
tifu,3dhmqt,heyitsgrace,2,Thu Jul 16 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"I admire guys like you. It's a shame it didn't work out. I actually did this once to a guy I saw and liked 3 months ago. I went to his work place 2 weeks ago and told him straight that I thought he was really good looking, he seemed very flattered. We met up at his break later on and he surprisingly all the girls he's been with have gone up to him first yet I'm the first one he could feel comfortable with so quickly. And he doesn't understand why I went up to him 3 months after. He said he was confused at first at how sudden I was and why I picked him out of everyone. To be honest.. I don't know why I did that. It was a bit spontaneous and I hadn't felt like that for someone in years.  Things have been going well up until now but there have been a few ups and downs in the past 2 weeks.. but I somehow can't stay away from him no matter how many times I get angry at him."
tifu,3dhmqt,miserylovespie,2,Thu Jul 16 17:40:31 2015 UTC,In my opinion the only way you fucked up was not talking to her while she was still on the bus.  Obviously getting rejected sucks but if you don't ask you'll never get anywhere.

Keep going, maybe dial back the ""you're amazing"" bit - just make regular conversation - and you'll figure it out as you go.   Keep in mind - she wasn't horrified, she didn't think you were a creep. She smiled, thanked you, and did her best to let you down easy. Which is what most girls will do. Keep at it."

I know first hand because I've been in the exact same situation before and I didn't step up. I'm in a good relationship now but I missed a lot of opportunities when I was younger by being to afraid of rejection.

You put your balls out on the line, and sure you got shot down, but life isn't about whether or not you get shot down, it's whether or not you acted. So you acted and you lost an hour of your time. It's not like you were late for something important. All in all, well done OP. You showed confidence and got what you came for. You know.  And who knows, maybe a month from now you'll read the inverse TIFU from her perspective where she splits with her BF and is now sore about the missed opportunity and BAM you reconnect because you read it and you made that connection. So there's a chance, but don't bet the ranch on it. The more connections like this you make the more opportunities you'll have to meet a special someone."

It's ultimately up to her decide whether or not to give you her number on the spot, but she has to consider the relationship she's already in then. If she thought her man was kind of ""on his way out"" she probably would have given you her number and maybe dated you on the sly while she decided. In your case, she weighed the options and decided she did not want to put her current relationship in jeopardy for someone new.  Good on you for taking the chance."
tifu,3dhmqt,weirdestbonerEVER,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:30:49 2015 UTC,An hour's wait for a bus is more than worth the price of proving you can do something.  Talking to the next lady you are smitten with will be like climbing a hill after climbing K2.

tifu,3docgv,Carbhai,2,Fri Jul 17 23:15:09 2015 UTC,"Well. She sounds unreasonable as fuck. You are so better off without her.   If given the opportunity to get back together, do not under any circumstances get back with that bowl of batshit crazy."
tifu,3docgv,xNS5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I was considering it, obviously because I'm a stupid 17 year old and she was my first real girlfriend, but we fought constantly because she would never even be reasonable enough to let me voice my opinions about things.

Just understand that if that's what she wants, you have to let her go.  It may suck now, but a few years down the road you'll laugh and wonder WTF.

tifu,3dilui,Adjudikated,-16,Thu Jul 16 16:11:25 2015 UTC,"It's obvious your a sexual deviant with an unquenchable thirst or you wouldn't be a chronic swipe righter.   However its from my studies that I have come to realize most girls/women on it are no better. End of the day their approach is just alot more subtle and less primitive. So while her immaturity might make this uncomfortable, she's on there doing the same shit as you and she's probably just as much of a deviant as you....minus the jeffrey dahmer stare of course....which you should probably work on."
tifu,3dilui,CapnJaques,3,Thu Jul 16 17:22:59 2015 UTC,"Immature or not, the way I understand Tinder IIRC, is that she wouldn't have been notified, like you said (maybe it was someone else, but still somewhat relevant regardless), had she not previously swiped right herself. Then again, like I said, I have no idea how Tinder really works...fact is, her actions sound extremely immature, high school level drama queen...she's childish, enjoys starting shit, and she's just as guilty as him with the Tinder shenanigans. As far as HR, she's just as responsible as him for bringing it into the workplace, and now creating a hostile, uncomfortable workplace...but hell, not being an expert on the intricacies of HR, I wouldn't take my ramblings for anything more than just that.     AFAIC - What happens on Tinder, stays on Tinder, and because she also swiped right...she wants the D...if I've learned anything on Reddit, you need to assert your dominance by peeing on her deviant ass OP...Give it to her."

So unless she's immature and goes running her mouth about it, it really shouldn't effect OP at all because it would make her look just as bad as him."

You're making this situation  into a mess with your panicked reactions. Yeah, you gave her a 'death stare' but she'll hear about your spaced out stares from co-workers... Yeah, you sent her a raunchy message, but who cares, she just thinks your confident now. Go into work and be confident.  Don't bring it up.  Act like nothing happened, be easy going and  relaxed.  Other people will take their cues from you.  Also, don't initiate any contact with her. I'm saying this as a girl, she's probably embarrassed she swiped right on a new co-worker also (especially since girls tend to be more selective when choosing the guys).  She probably feels like she messed up also.  Just play it cool and this whole thing will blow over."
tifu,3dilui,_Wolverine007_,4,Fri Jul 17 10:03:10 2015 UTC,"that is the worst idea. Just stop freaking out and telling everyone about it. She swiped right on you too. You would have been fine if you didn't send a million follow up messages. Pretend it never happened, move on."

tifu,3dilui,Daegs,12,Thu Jul 16 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"Its probably an ""in the moment"" sorta thing. That mixed in with him being at work. I say own it. Its never as bad as it seems. Spreading seed can get awkward anyways"
tifu,3dilui,Bog77,9,Thu Jul 16 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"Look at it from her point of view, this guy twice her age swipes right for her.

tifu,3dilui,Neologic29,30,Thu Jul 16 16:32:56 2015 UTC,Where you fucked up was apologizing.  She swiped right on you too dingus.  Either she swipes right on everything too and you can laugh about you common Tinder strategies.  Or she honestly swiped right and was into you.

tifu,3dilui,Kinglech,3,Thu Jul 16 23:44:29 2015 UTC,"Why did she swipe right on him? His age wouldn't have been a secret, so she seemingly wasn't put off by that.  Given that she was new, I can see perhaps she didn't know he worked for the same company, but worst case scenario is it's awkward.  I agree the 1000 yard stare didn't help matters, but OP did that as a result of being mortified at the match.  That's what didn't really jive with me.  Oh well, I can't fault OP really."
tifu,3dilui,dylc,2,Thu Jul 16 23:48:05 2015 UTC,She swiped right because she wanted the D.
tifu,3dilui,bwrobel12,3,Fri Jul 17 01:37:14 2015 UTC,"Just gonna say, not a huge possibility you'd be fired. If this is a first time occurrence, HR would probably give you a warning, if it even gets to them. The girl might just decide to ignore it, or she might talk to you about it herself. Or, if you're really lucky, she's into you and into some dirty stuff, and you're set.   General advice here: Don't dig your own grave."

tifu,3dl9se,Immortal-sunbro,6,Fri Jul 17 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"I assume OP is female?? But anyway, from a male teachers perspective, its always in the back of my mind that if I'm alone in a classroom with a female student, that it's her word agasnt mine. In college, we had a a whole day dedicated to disengaging from a student who may be flirting, because who would have guessed, teenagers are horny. We had a union rep come in and tell us those ""this could be you"" stories about teachers being caught up in the ""he said/she said"" and even if you hadn't done anything,  you could still be in trouble if a student even mentions you being inappropriate. I laughed it off as alarmist BS at the time, but when I was student teaching, I actually had.a girl pass me a note saying she thought I was a cute. Nope the fuck out of there and immediately showed my supervisor teacher and he took it and brought it to the principal who actually had an entire folder of the similar notes from various students. She told me to never be alone with this student and if she ever comes into the classroom after school and comes onto me, that I should pick up the phone and call the principal, if she didnt pick up, just leave the line open so it records what I say on her voicemail. That put the fear of God into me, and luckily nothing came of it, but the principal told me that she deals with students trying to get romantic with teachers probably once or twice a month in a school of around 2000 kids.  So before you guys judge the teacher, remember, he was probably thinking the whole time ""shit I don't want to deal with this!"""
tifu,3dl9se,PCRenegade,4,Fri Jul 17 15:26:12 2015 UTC,"Can confirm the paranoia. Was an adjunct. Had a student make a pass at me. Politely rejected her but did not inform supervisor.

When I explained the situation to my supervisor she said I should have reported her making a pass a me and that because there was now a student complaint against me and no paper trail to support my end, that I was not welcome back next year."

Her bf came up to me for advice of what to do cause he didn't like her like that anymore and I knew she was in teenage love with him.  I told him that he should donut sooner then later.   Well he did and me and this girl spent rest of the summer hanging out ever is when I really started like her but I didn't think she liked me like that and I didn't hunk I ever stood a chance.   She was the head cheerleader beautiful prom queen.  Me pretty nerdy average looking guy.  Found out about a year later that she was liking me at that time too.   The oblivious part was looking back at all the subtle things I missed the looks this things she would do sitting on my lap messing with my hair. How I was an inconsiderate idiot not think stood a chance and just trying to see her as a friend and talking her about the other girls I liked or trying to get her to set me up with her cousin.   Stupid teenage me.

I kinda like your serious video however I think that you should pronounce your second name more clearly. That Zimmerman sounds a bit like Wizsman. Maybe it's just because I'm used to the german pronunciation. You should look at that and start doing it the german way. People will hire you.. because they are afraid.

They basically ended up looking more or less the same, because constantly getting rejected just made me lose motivation. If I had received my own application I would not have given it a second thought.  I had a chat with a work coach to gain back some motivation, got some tips (one of them that standing out is the key), wrote two creative applications and sent them out. I got both jobs. I'm starting my new job as an AD in two weeks.  Who knows, maybe you're exactly who they're looking for. Maybe those white people in suits really needed a laugh.

If you're referring to ""Bible"" (uppercase), then I hope you weren't trying to offend me with your implication that it's fiction since that doesn't affect me at all personally.  I've pretty much decided I'm agnostic and I respect others' right to their beliefs just as I expect them to respect mine.  If you believe ""The Bible"" is a work of fiction, that's your right and I'm not going to tell you it's not.  But to go out of your way to offend a huge segment of the population who regard it as their primary religious text is just bad manners, man. They believe it's ""the literal word of God"" and you're trying to rub their collective noses in the fact that you think they're wrong.  You'll succeed in offending some of them.  Congrats.  Good job.  A lot of the rest will probably pray for you.  The rest will just ignore you which is probably the best policy.  Whether fact or fiction, I truly believe that book is a great instruction manual for how to live a morally sound life, e.g., treat people the way you want to be treated, don't murder people, etc.  It's not without its faults though, most, if not all, of which are due to misinterpretation/misrepresentation by zealots.

tifu,3dj9g6,the_exofactonator,4,Thu Jul 16 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  I personally am of the belief that much of the bible is an allegory or symbolic.  For example, why can't ""7 days"" be ""7 billion years""?  Could early humans really have understood the concept of an atom or the size of the universe?  I don't know.  But then again I'm a protestant and protestants tend to be less traditional or literal about the bible.  I've always liked Eugenie Scott's opinion on God & Science.  I don't feel it justifies my religious beliefs, but I certainly feel that she makes a compelling argument why Christians shouldn't fear science.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OCNiz3w9cs  So, I am open to the Pope modernizing the entire Christian belief.  My favorite Bible quotes are the ones about love being the most important trait a Christian should have.  Specifically Matthew 22:36-40.  It just didn't happen in this case and I was just pointing out the hoax to help avoid it getting propagated.  The thing is, I don't live in my hometown and she does.  And I don't talk with my old friends as often as I should.

It doesn't automatically recall the message unless the other person has that feature automatically enabled and they are on the same work exchange server.  Most people have not enabled this feature because it lets anyone put anything automatically on their calendar also.  So what happens is it sends the other person an email that politely asks if they will let you delete it from their inbox. They will have to click yes to let you recall the message.  Chances are most people are curious and will click no so they can read it.

There is no excuse or apology that you could say to make the boyfriend feel better about it, just make sure you own your mistake and learn from it, figure out really why you wanted to cheat.   Don't wallow and make yourself into a victim, you don't move past anything as a victim, and a victim of yourself is just going to dig you deeper, especially saying that this is what ""I' deserve. If you want my unsolicited advice, take time and figure out why you cheated and what you want in a relationship or be ready to make the same mistake again when you feel a relationship isn't where you wanted it to be.  Apologies are empty after trust is broken, and don't insult your SO with that, tell him what happened and own your mistake. The why is important to become trustworthy in ""your"" own eyes again. It took a long time before I became trustworthy in my own eyes after cheating, and leveling head on with myself.

Imagine if the door opened accidentally while someone was inside doing their business.  Well... imagine no more, yesterday evening it happened, I of course love the company and want to protect it, so I wound back the tape a few minutes to destroy that bit of the footage.  I recommend we move the camera so that in the future it wouldn't happen to a less loyal employee or a client who would rather a quick buck by suing the company.  Take the focus off of the small fact, make your action seem as protecting the company instead of yourself, then make a suggestion that you're protecting the company for a large lawsuit.  Your indiscretion will be forgotten and the fact that you destroyed the footage that you could have used against the company to protect it will be remembered. They'll then probably move the camera."

tifu,3dgt7u,thelidpatrick,8,Thu Jul 16 04:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'm in the Navy just finished nuke school and I feel your pain bro. I wake up at 0520 for a 0745 muster. Anyways good on you for putting that shitbag in his place, the laziness in the civilian workforce gets to me sometimes because people don't understand how precious time is."
tifu,3dgt7u,Eskaminagaga,4,Thu Jul 16 15:33:27 2015 UTC,You are in the Navy as a nuke?  Be prepaired to see a level of laziness that you have never seen before from your fellow nukes once you reach the fleet.
tifu,3dgt7u,hardolaf,3,Thu Jul 16 16:32:39 2015 UTC,The fleet? Lol I've seen it since day 1 in A school.
tifu,3dgt7u,thelidpatrick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"In A school, many still have the fear and discipline from boot camp in them. By the time you make it to prototype, you will start seeing their true colors and how lazy you can possibly be while still being in the military."
tifu,3dgt7u,hardolaf,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:18 2015 UTC,I start prototype tomorrow lol.
tifu,3dgt7u,throwingaway975468,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:39 2015 UTC,South Carolina or New York?  Note that the quality of instructors in prototype is very different than A and Power school. Those are usually high performers. Prototype instructors are usually just average nukes that decided to stay in for some reason.
tifu,3dgt7u,the_gooog,2,Thu Jul 16 17:04:29 2015 UTC,SC I didn't want to go back to NY I was born and raised. Hate the snow.
tifu,3dgt7u,throwingaway975468,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I went to NY because I had never been to the area and wanted a change of scenery after being in A and Power school for a year. I liked the area up there more, personally.  If you see ET1 Guarino, you can trust him as long as you are a hard worker. He is one of the few Nukes that I knew on my ship that always strived to work hard and do his best and I know he respects those that do the same."
tifu,3dgt7u,average_army_guy,3,Thu Jul 16 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"We understand how precious time is when it matters. But to be fair, I don't have to clean anything, I have staff for that. I don't need to run my own experiments, I have staff for that. I don't need to meet with my boss more than once a month, I can keep him fully updated via email. My deadlines are usually months out and I can usually get my work done a month to two weeks before the deadline. I don't normally have to worry about emergencies, I just leave the building and wait for HazMat and the fire department to clear it, usually when this happens, I'll just go to a nearby coffee shop or library and browse reddit. When I have a design's deadline moved forward a month, I put my head down and work through it as fast as possible hoping I don't make a mistake and putting in as many hours as are necessary to get it done on time. A missed deadline can inconvenience multiple governments, their agencies, and many universities. So I don't miss deadlines.  Oh, I forgot to mention, if I have no work to do, and the people under me are well tasked and don't need me on site, I can just go home. I once took a week off with pay because I wasn't needed the whole time because we had no projects for me to work on. The next Monday, a contract had been signed and we had a new project so I was back to work.  I don't have busywork in my job. Everything that I do, everything that my supervisor and boss do, everything my co-workers do, everything my subordinates do has a purpose. And that purpose is never to keep them busy. It's to educate them, to create an experimental set up, to design an experiment, to form theories as to physical phenomena, to create specifications for tools needed and then purchase them. Everything we do has a purpose and time matters. But when your deadline is 9 months out on a project, and you have maybe a few small tasks to do each week and a fed other small projects, you can work at a relaxed pace. If we rush, we make mistakes that can cost a few million dollars, but we don't care about money. We care about having to wait another year to schedule an experiment to run at a national lab because someone fucked up. We are acutely aware of time and we are acutely aware of how rushing makes projects fail. We're currently doing a post mortem of a project that failed due to being rushed.  The civilian world is aware of time as well as the military is. The difference is that we don't need to do busywork at work. We can look at a job where we do work that serves no purpose and quit. We can just refuse to do that work and the company will spend $5,000 to $20,000 just to bring someone on to do it... or they will get rid of the busywork completely which is much cheaper."
tifu,3dgt7u,dcbcpc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"I respect this, but I feel that you're off subject my comment was related to the laziness when you're supposed to be somewhere on time or when you're supervisor calls for you there should be no waiting or tardiness. Either way you probably wanted to let some steam off and that's fine I mean I would never write that much to a complete stranger online."
tifu,3dgt7u,Notacatmeow,3,Thu Jul 16 18:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I just run into a lot of military researchers and personnel as they work on projects that I'm close to and they piss me off to no end. They work so quickly they end up ignoring so many issues that by the time they go to look at what they've done, 90% of their work is wasted. And then I end up getting something that should have taken three weeks to get from them if they were civilians in 3 months because they keep fucking up because they keep moving too quickly.  My boss is never on time. He has his schedule every day planned down to the tenth of an hour and if one meeting goes over by even 3 minutes, that can cascade into him being late for a meeting several hours later. Our work schedules are very fluid as almost everything we do is purely mental (and typing/using a mouse). We end up working when we're at our best mentally each day. For some of us that is 0830, for others it's 1200.  For meetings, we have one first thing every Monday and no one is ever late because it matters. When the skype call goes out to us, everyone picks up within 30 seconds and the meeting starts.  But yes, civilian life is more lax than military. But it works and works extremely well."
tifu,3dgt7u,pallydanny,22,Thu Jul 16 19:23:50 2015 UTC,What did you normally do when you showed up so early?  Start working?  Or just...wait?  Or something else?  I never understood this.
tifu,3dgt7u,RedAngellion,40,Thu Jul 16 10:16:59 2015 UTC,"during active duty, PT would start at 0700 so id leave my house at 0530. it takes me roughly 7 to 10 min to base(ft.hood) but leaving this early would mean beating rush hour traffic. but when i do get there I usually wait in the car then go sign in roughly 30 mins early and start forming up. in the army when you're on time you're late, when you're early you're on time."
tifu,3dgt7u,bonerjones,9,Thu Jul 16 11:21:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, ""forming up""?  What does this entail?"

I caught dumbasses having a 0530 formation to get accountability before my 0630 accountability formation.  I told my platoon sergeant that if they were that inefficient then I would not need their services any more.  As a private I was in a unit that had like 5 formations a day and I always vowed that if I ever got to be in charge (and I did), I would prevent dumb shit like that from happening."

Odd, he knew everybody's favorite beer, birthdays of their kids and spouses, anniversaries.    Guy was out fucking standing as a leader because he let his NCOs do their jobs and only stepped in when the problem got to his pay grade.   He retired last month. Now I'm sad."

I figured they were being punished for something haha and since our unit has a ""no hour before formation formations they were told to form up in the head... Haha good times."

Accountability formation (to make sure everyone was there) was at 0630 with PT directly following.  During that hour most people are sleeping in the stairwells waiting for formation, cleaning shit platoon sergeant is pissed off about, or getting a jump start on the days tasks."
tifu,3dgt7u,Ludacon,2,Thu Jul 16 13:32:11 2015 UTC,I wish I could remember what that's like. Any time a mission comes down it's show up half an hour early. Each cog in the chain passes the message and adds half an hour so we end up coming at 0300 to roll out at 0600.

Everything we do is slow and deliberate. Whenever we rush, we are liable to make mistakes. The made a mistake recently, we're doing a post mortem of it. The post mortem is going on month 4 and we've discovered many things we personally didn't know before. We try to never rush. We work slowly and methodically. If we get tired, we'll go to a couch and take a nap or go home early and work from home. We had a guy from DARPA come in and he was just disgusted by how slowly we work but he couldn't argue with the results: one partially failed project (fell short of spec and we're still working on fixing it) in the last fifteen years. We complete a project about once a month."

I think maybe after 10 years I stopped being annoyed...maybe? I was raised by a lot of people, including captains of bases, and people a lot higher rank than my daddy.  After going from this life of travelling and living on base and then trying to transition to civilian life? It was HARD.   I learned almost all my important lessons from military officers. Specifically not to steal (age 3) and to keep your seat belt on (age 7) you haven't been disciplined as a child until you have a big man with a gun staring down at you, talking like you're a little soldier.

tifu,3dgt7u,Universalis20,8,Thu Jul 16 12:48:34 2015 UTC,"As long as you have more time in service/time in grade (time at that rank), hell yes. That E-4 mafia did more disciplinary control than a Sergeant ever could lol"

In the team sense, his reaction was to prevent the mission (meeting) from failure or delay. It's very common in the Army to see senior lower enlisted members crack the whip before a Noncommissioned Officer has to repeat himself."
tifu,3dgt7u,Universalis20,2,Thu Jul 16 14:30:21 2015 UTC,But he was not senior. I feel like if the newest member of the unit starts bitching people out it might not fly even in the military.
tifu,3dgt7u,mrmcmaine,3,Thu Jul 16 14:36:32 2015 UTC,"True, he was not senior in this company but in his mind it has to do with TIG/TIS... a new member to a unit makes no difference to time in service (military) and grade (rank.) This is part of the transition process and he failed to control the impulse. I'm not arguing that what he did was out of line... I'm saying that it happens because it takes some folks longer to be able to control those immediate impulses."
tifu,3dgt7u,AuthorSAHunt,5,Thu Jul 16 14:47:42 2015 UTC,Ah I never really thought about that. I guess in the military its common to start a new job/assignment and be the most senior based on TIS/TIG. Really OP failed to recognize that his TIS had reverted to 0.
tifu,3dgt7u,SKINNERRRR,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"Now you have it! This is part of the complexity of transition... again, some folks have no issue with it and adapt quickly. For others it takes longer to adjust and those impulses to ""fix it"" get easier with time."
tifu,3dgt7u,sellyberry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"Well what I was saying is that this is less about the difference in acceptable behavior in military vs civilian life, and more about failing to recognize one's position/role. A supervisor yelling at a slowpoke would be no problem at the places I have worked (The profanity might get you a talking to, but in a lot of places would pass without mention). Now if a brand new worker yells at another worker (who is senior to him) I could see telling him that if it happens again he'll be fired."

I'm not sure what occupation you are in or pursuing now, but I went straight to work out in the oil field's of West Texas doing rig safety and industrial fire fighting. It gave me the opportunity to be around a similar style of culture and really let my work ethic and military skills shine through. I would highly suggest you find a job where you can be around similar people or other veterans to help you better integrate. Most importantly... find a company that values it's employees like family members. If you've been in a good unit, you know what this is like. You chain of command genuinely cared for your well being and you would go through hell and back for them with no questions asked.  Find that company... the faster you do, the better off you will be in the long run. They do exist I can assure you! I have the pleasure of working next to a retired Master Gunnery Sergeant and we get along great if you can believe it. He's also not too far out of the service and we both watch out for each other and work hard. Our company isn't perfect, but they take care of us and we go the extra mile for them. That's the kind of employer you want to find! I worked up the ladder in my old company (started out in the field doing safety) and eventually started working in their corporate office and it just wasn't for me. The culture was wrong, the culture was toxic and the people were like zombies coming into the office everyday... it was absolutely soul-sucking and miserable. I lucked out and found a new opportunity that gives me a mixture of office and field time with a smaller company. I'm not going anywhere, it's a perfect match for me and my family.  Also, the reason the Army tells you there aren't any jobs out there isn't a lie per say; it's meant to warn you that there are not jobs IDENTICAL to what you do in the service that are in high demand for most MOSs. Regardless of how you ""translate"" our skills, it's not an exact match to civilian equivalents that are easily staffed. So, understand that this is where you have to be creative to match your military career to a job description and most importantly, you need to conduct your own interview with a company to find out if they are worth your time and loyalty. That's your most important skill... you know what loyalty and duty truly means. Let me know if I can help."

In some places, a boy aged 16 years and one day might be able to go to prison and be a lifelong sex offender for having sex with a girl aged 13 years, 11 months, and 25 days.   That said, the offender could well have been 30 years old and having sex with a 13 year old. Which is about 1000 times sleazier and morally reprehensible."

tifu,3dg4vo,hairy_cock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:06:19 2015 UTC,"All right, that was perhaps hyperbole. But it's worse in that 13 year olds are naive and often easily manipulated, and are lacking in adult judgment, so there's much more chance of a seemingly consenual encounter being coerced. If you have a 13 year old sleeping with a 16 year old, the power imbalance is much less."

Edit: like someone above said, he's in his 50s and the registry hasn't been around that long. So that means he fiddled someone under 14, somewhat recently, like in his 40s-50s or they still have him in the system from when he was young, which is unlikely unless he did something super awful.

This wasn't her first or second time being ""raped"" but of course she decides this is the one she needs to make a lesson out of. Fucked his life all up but got him clean and out of that whole scene. What makes me most mad is we hear stories about her still running around on drugs, getting fucked, not caring how she legitimately put someone on Megan's law for 15 years while she still lives her life the same exact way, putting herself in the same situations where that kind of thing might happen.   My whole family knows and supports me. They met him and love him. I would get the full story before you make assumptions cause your sister probably already knows.

If this guy was a kid, lets say 17-18 and he was dating a freshman/sophomore while he was a senior in highschool, that could potentially put him in this category. I'd try and pin his approximate age at the time of his offense based on his conviction date. He may have been caught up in an out of control judicial system. Kind of like getting expelled for making a gun with your fingers because of zero tolerance nonsense or being labeled a lifetime sex offender because you took a drunken piss in the alley behind a bar. Just my two cents."

My only response to this is, (and take from it what you will) but when I type in his name on google images. Two pictures show up. One that was recent and one that was simi old. I'm guessing mid-late 90s. Their both ""mugshots"" but I use the term ""mugshots"" loosely because their specifically for the sex offender website. Typically for run of the mill sex offenders, you register every year. If your violent it's every 90-30 days. From what I understand, most people, like for the example of taking a piss in public, those people can file exempt status as their crime isn't as harsh as others. So they can have their picture removed from the site, but are still considered a sex offender. Some may be waived and they can be removed depending on the situation and present your case to a panel. The fact that they have his new address (my sister lives with him and recently moved in with him like a month ago) tells me he still has to go through the process and he isn't exempt based on the facts of his case."
tifu,3dg4vo,Baresark,12,Thu Jul 16 03:24:20 2015 UTC,"So, if I'm comprehending this correctly, the older picture was the very first mugshot? If this is right, and he's mid-fifties now, then that kind of removes the teenage boyfriend/girlfriend chance."

My mom is 2nd degree and has to register for life, If I remember correctly the shortest time you can be made to register is 15 years. I've dealt with this a lot because my town is a huge hotspot for sex offenders. Chances are that if he still has to register then she knows about it because often when you have to register you have a Probation/Parole officer and they do surprise visits and theres no way she cannot know about that. I lived with my mom for a few years so I know what the process is like. I also know that not every sex offender is like they portray them on crime shows."

Now, here's something you have to remember - your sister is an adult. You can't control her relationships. If she decides to stay with him, that's her right. The biggest mistake you could do is to tell her to dump him. All you have to do is tell her you are willing to support her no matter her choice.

This info just came up when I read up on public urination. Also, my grammar is awful and I don't care."
tifu,3dg4vo,Mustaka,2,Thu Jul 16 06:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't tell her on her birthday. Just be honest, say I was googling and this popped up. She may already knows and it could be a non-issue, like other people have said it's very easy to be labelled a monster when the truth is more complicated. But you should totally talk to her about it."
tifu,3dg4vo,gazhealey,2,Thu Jul 16 09:19:46 2015 UTC,"Just looked up my address and at some point, there was a tenant who lived here (it's a 2 bdrm house with a converted garage...not a huge building) was a registered sex offender. Apparently he's never updated his info, so my house shows up on Megan's Law website. I clicked to email the DOJ, so hopefully that can be updated sooner than later.  The weird thing is I feel like I've looked up my address before in the 5 years I've lived here and didn't see that listing before."

He could be someone who made poor choices when he was younger.  If he is man enough to face this, he might just be man enough for your sister."
tifu,3dg4vo,FootGoesInMouth,2,Thu Jul 16 13:40:18 2015 UTC,"Please realize that the charge that he has is a catch-all charge.  I would not condemn him as a child-molester per say.  Definitely find out the details of the case but don't be accusatory.  He most likely has moved on and is ashamed of his past actions. He can't hide from them and there is a great chance that your sister is already aware of his past but chooses not to share it with the family for fear of an over-reaction by all. Be open minded when you do talk to him.  Up until this time you don't appear to have had a problem with this guy and was actually going to recommend him to a neighbor.  Perhaps he is a better man today.  Plus, he should be on the local sex offender list most likely if he is on California's with just a few exceptions possible."

""Criminal sexual conduct,"" however, can mean anything from the woman being on top to goatfucking to kiddiefiddling to pre-2002-homosexuality.  God only knows.    Some states probably throw parallel parking in, ffs.  So unless you look up the statute for the exact state, no one has any idea what's going on.  Possibly not even then, if the law is rediculously vague - ""child molestation"" in california involves any contact with the feet, for instance, and there's probably other meaninglessly-broad laws in other states.  Could be rape, could be child molestation, could be helping the sheep over the fence, could be gay, could be nothing.  No one knows without state-specific research."

tifu,3de5jl,pantene2inone,554,Wed Jul 15 16:40:18 2015 UTC,I partied with a dude one night (first time I ever met the guy) and we blazed. Next day I had a job interview...with the dude from the night before.  Trippy.
tifu,3de5jl,m3t4lw01f,195,Wed Jul 15 19:10:00 2015 UTC,So....did you get the job?
tifu,3de5jl,pantene2inone,349,Wed Jul 15 19:58:35 2015 UTC,I did. Worked there a full five years.

tifu,3de5jl,Whit3W0lf,93,Wed Jul 15 21:02:15 2015 UTC,"I walked in and we both kind of did a double take. Then we both smiled.  I was no longer nervous about the interview, that's for sure."
tifu,3de5jl,NoobsliceZA,3,Wed Jul 15 21:55:13 2015 UTC,"Whether he smiled or not, I wouldn't be nervous anymore. It can only go one of two ways and they already know a lot more about you than they otherwise would."
tifu,3de5jl,Tryen,65,Thu Jul 16 14:16:16 2015 UTC,hell yea! that's my type of interview haha
tifu,3de5jl,SaltyTaintJuice,21,Wed Jul 15 19:23:32 2015 UTC,One better. A friend of mine played Dota 2 with a guy that he had met in pub scrubs. They played for 7 months together and my friend is an exemplary leader and always kept his cool. He went to a job interview and was interviewed by the boss of this software development company. It was the same guy. He was hired and promoted instantly.

tifu,3de5jl,Doyle524,20,Thu Jul 16 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"I would have agreed a year ago, but my Note 3 has been seriously letting me down in the past 8-12 months (out of two years) of owning it.  What gets to me the most is the unoptimized apps. Several apps that I use on a regular basis are terribly unoptimized compared to their iOS counterparts.  Skype on my old 4S is smooth and full-featured.. compared to the sluggish, limited-features mess that it is on my Note (Lollipop).  I'm 90% certain that I'm going to go back to iOS when it's upgrade time this November."
tifu,3de5jl,Walt_F,26,Thu Jul 16 04:42:46 2015 UTC,"Look at Androids manufactured by companies other than Samsung. Touchwiz (the overlay they put on top of Android, akin to HTC's Sense) is slow and clunky compared to stock Android. I personally recommend a Nexus 6, since you seem to prefer the larger phablet form factor."
tifu,3de5jl,tfangel,6,Thu Jul 16 04:46:34 2015 UTC,Touchwiz is easily the shittiest custom Android experience.  I actually love Sense though.

tifu,3dif4r,whydiditakethejob,10,Thu Jul 16 15:02:46 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can give you is to form a board of people to help make ideas. This should make things easier, since more ideas can be made, different outlooks to the same problem will be seen, and you won't have all the burden on your shoulders.  Whenever you have time, learn how to become a CEO. This should make things a bit easier by giving you an idea of how to run this. With this knowledge you may be able to break the cycle by not doing the same mistakes your boss made.  Learn from the mistakes your boss made and the company who was being ""nice"" to him. If you can find the problem,  you may be able to find the solution.  You aren't crazy. Giving your all to a company makes you a teamplayer. If you're willing to do what is necessary to get this company back on track, people would notice and back you up. Thus making a more united company.  To make decisions a bit easier,  talk to your boss about everything that has happened to him and the company. His experience will help to not make the same mistakes."
tifu,3dif4r,ThePaulmann,6,Thu Jul 16 15:28:41 2015 UTC,"I have done this type of work in the past.  I recommend getting some Business Plan software such as as Business Plan Pro.  Pick a model in the software which closely matches what the business model is supposed to be.  Once you go through and put all the data in, you will find the plan gives you greater insight into how to improve the operation of the business.  The added bonus is the plan can be distributed to the investors and other management people for comment and discussion.  You will look like a pro, learn more about business operations by using the software, and maybe (just maybe) find a way to right the ship without causing yourself too much pain."
tifu,3dif4r,Xavier_Stone,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:37 2015 UTC,That some really good advice there. Thank you. Is there any particular software you recommend or have preferred to use over another one?
tifu,3dif4r,Xavier_Stone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"I have really liked ""Palo Alto Software"" -> ""Business Plan Pro"".  I have worked with small up to medium sized companies and have had good luck with this software.  What is interesting is you can put in all the information with an ""interview"" format.  When it generated the plan you can see soft spots in your business and almost immediately realize what may need to change to improve the company.  One company I worked for was limiting their marketing to small (and shrinking) demographics because ""this was how we always do it"".  The data pointed to different areas of the city and state which we focused marketing on and made quick improvements to sales."

tifu,3dif4r,edmundburkewasright,4,Fri Jul 17 03:03:01 2015 UTC,"You are obviously smart, or you wouldn't be in the position you are in.  What I think you are failing to take into account, is the fact that every single one of you is faking it.  All of you, all of us, everyone.  There is no person in this world that has it figured out.  We fake it until it becomes reality or until we can't fake it anymore.  Each of us is intimately aware of our shortcomings, our fears, our failures ad we think that information is etched on to our faces.  We view others as if they are the real ones, the solid ones, and we are the cardboard cutouts pretending to be 3d when we are as thin as a strip of paper. But the world only sees our actions, the results of our efforts, not the content of our hearts or our brains.  So you have a choice, embrace it, give it everything, fake it 110% until it becomes the truth, or you walk away and you go fake it somewhere else, in some other role, until you make that role into your reality."
tifu,3dif4r,MikeSikey,2,Thu Jul 16 21:40:19 2015 UTC,"oddly comforting and discomforting. I kind of thought that I would fake it till I found the real me. Scary to think that I don't find ""it"", but I create ""it""."
tifu,3dif4r,WhatAreThoose,2,Fri Jul 17 03:04:57 2015 UTC,"Every person who you think has it figured out, doesn't.  Anyone who tells you they have, is lying.  The difference between the successful and the failed is a combination of belief, perseverance, effort and dash of luck (just a tiny bit).  Beware those that are sure of their knowledge, for they are the most likely to lead you astray, or something to that effect.  This same system applies to truth, the unknown, whatever it is that troubles you.  There is no objective truth beyond what you create.    My way, is not your way, could not be your way and will cause more harm than good if you attempt to duplicate it.  Quote I remember, but where I got it (sorry whoever you are) is this ""Do not seek to be like great people, seek what they themselves sought"". It's like, if every single person on earth had a different shaped butt, varying from the size of a penny to the size of a buick, with no two being the same, the blueprint for my perfect chair will do you no good, you have to make your blueprint designed around the shape of your butt.    It's discomforting, yes, but remember that discomfort is drive that took us from living in caves and eating dirt to a luxury suite at the bellagio.  Comfort never built shit.  Comfort is a rest are on the freeway of success. Always, there should be this belief that the next rest stop is prettier, has better vending machines and doesn't have a pair of buck tooth hillbillies doing it the back of a pick-up truck in the parking lot.  Don't run from discomfort, engage it, like an old friend that always knows just what to say to have you at your best, delivering your ""A"" game, when it matters most.    I'm not telling you to put everything you have into rescuing the company (if that's even possible), nor am I telling you to run like you're being chased by your ex's dad after he finds out you cheated on his daughter with his wife, I'm just saying, don't discount your abilities and don't over inflate the abilities of others.  We, as a species, have a bad habit of giving undeserved and unearned weight to the thoughts and opinions of others much more heavily than our own out of the mistaken belief that they know better.  They don't.  They may know more, but they don't know better and with enough effort, you can know as much as they do.  We are the ultimate authority of what the right course of action is in EVERY situation because only we have to live with the consequences of every single decision."

Hedonism is not only about pleasure being a primary goal but also about trying to avoid any kind of ""suffering"" or drawbacks from a decision.  Say, you can smoke, it brings pleasure to you.  However, as a hedonist you understand that picking up such a habit would cause your life to turn for the worse. It would cause problems with health. You want your life to be pleasant, and illnesses cause you to suffer. So, you don't smoke if you are an actual hedonist.  It is sad that people tend to think that being a hedonist means being an ""animal "", i.e. have no  willingness to avoid potentially harmful decisions."

tifu,3di1hr,vostov,10,Thu Jul 16 13:07:05 2015 UTC,"When you activate a credit card, immediately set up autopay for the full balance. If you're not confident you can pay off your balance every month, you should not be using credit cards. $20 is a very low bonus for opening a card. Granted the GAP card entitles you to recurring savings exclusive to cardholders, but in general an opening bonus can reach hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in value, especially when redeemed for hotels or air travel -- see /r/churning for examples. Every credit card application dings your credit score. Too many credit cards will make lenders nervous, which could hurt you when you apply for mortgages and such."
tifu,3di1hr,jasonhe,3,Thu Jul 16 15:20:58 2015 UTC,"Actually having lots of credit can INCREASE your credit score because you can have a better credit usage ratio provided you don't carry a balance.   That said - OP call the card company and try to get that late fee removed. Ask to talk to a manager. When I do this I am always very nice to the phone person, if they say a manager can't help I just tell them they are probably right but I'll feel better if I give it a try. I have always been able to get fees removed. Again, be nice to the phone person. If the phone person is completely not helping you could also hang up and call back hoping to get a different person."

I know your heart's all excited right now but you've known her for 19yrs, a little longer won't make a difference.   Be her friend, that's what she needs right now. You've made your feelings known and when she recovers from whatever happened she'll either come around or you guys will be friends for another 20 years.

That's textbook self defense, you should not lose your job over this. I guess it's all in the hands of the parents though, if they admit he was in the wrong you might keep your job, but if they call up your boss and complains you are pretty much screwed."
tifu,3dg3gk,svennesvan,40,Thu Jul 16 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"Well, even if the parents do complain, as long the boss believed you were right, and the parents stop there, OP will have a job  Edit: words"
tifu,3dg3gk,ToTheDark,26,Thu Jul 16 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"Even though the boss may think OP was in the right he can still fire him because he doesn't want to risk ruining the reputation of the camp. If the rumor gets around a camp leader punched a special needs kid and kept his job, there might be some issues. I don't think many bosses will take that kind of risk, but who knows; this one might."
tifu,3dg3gk,svennesvan,33,Thu Jul 16 01:38:00 2015 UTC,"Let's have a civil discussion here. (No downvoting, let's learn something)  If this was a normal kid, and he started physically assaulting OP like that, OP would have very right to human instinct as that isn't karate nor textbook self-defense. Why does a special needs kid get the right to physically assault someone because of a mental disorder? This reminds me of a post on r/relationships where a special person got away with sexual assault because he had a mental disorder. Are the special needs people getting away with this from a moral/ethical standpoint or do they have extended rights by law? If its strictly moral//ethical does OP have rights to press charges for physical assualt?  I have personally been around several special needs kids, and feeling a bit insecure,  I always try to avoid contact, leave the scene whenever possible and distance myself from any issues. I feel bad for them but am to insecure to stay near them."
tifu,3dg3gk,Saahilj,6,Thu Jul 16 09:02:44 2015 UTC,This is because they can display  irrational behaviour. Animals (including us) do not like sudden loud noises or movements that these people tend to do. It can be frightening and puts you on edge if you aren't used to it.
tifu,3dg3gk,WhoNeedsBoys,9,Thu Jul 16 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"Finally, someone I can agree with. There are tons of special needs children that are wonderful and calm and loving. But there are these occasional brats that completely disturb me to no end. I remember in middle school we used to have to walk on the track before class started, and this special needs boy would run and intentionally ram people from behind with his shoulder as hard as he could. One time I got so sick of it that I sidestepped his charge and tripped him as he passed. I assume you can guess who went to the principal's office for bullying...  There are plenty of nice mentally challenged children and adults. But sometimes I have flashbacks to middle school and I get nervous when they start to jerk around or make loud noises.   Sometimes the mentally challenged must be held completely responsible for their actions."
tifu,3dg3gk,jptensta,2,Thu Jul 16 13:37:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, they need to be held responsible and if they are proven innocent in the court of law, they would need to be placed in an institution to isolate them from society. The kid who was punching you while you were running the track should've been punished. But if you went to complain to the teacher, they would probably say that he can't control it and to bear with it. At that point the only way you could make yourself seen was by tripping him; yet you got in trouble and he got away. This probably didn't make much sense but basically no one would punish the special needs kid in any scenario,  because ""he can't control it""!; and so mental disability is an acceptable accuse for mental, physical and sexual abuse which are normally unacceptable. Would they get away with murder due to mental disability?"
tifu,3dg3gk,Saahilj,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"I work with the mentally handicap as a caregiver. The parents who properly discipline their mentally handicapped children have children who know how to act. I've worked with handicapped who are allowed to do what ever they want. Some parents say their child cant understand, others say that despite the fact that they are mentally a child their technically an adult so they treat them like one. Of course these people do things like eat cookies, cupcakes, and cake for breakfast lunch and dinner, throw temper tantrums,  say things like ""You do what I say, you clean/do/make this because you work for me"", they refuse to chip in during group events where they are supposed to help clean or cook with everyone else in group. Then there are the parents who don't let their child use their disability as an excuse and are just amazing people to get to work with! I think handicapped people should be help responsible for their chosen actions just like able people."
tifu,3dg3gk,Hazarutha,5,Thu Jul 16 16:59:27 2015 UTC,"I read Commonweath law, so it may differ elsewhere: You can still get charged with crimes, however a defence of insanity can be pleaded. You will then have to produce a psychiatric/experts report to substantiate your defence that you were mentally ill at the time the offence was committed.   Let's say the judge/jury buys your story. You're pronounced not guilty. However, that means you were insane ""enough"" to be a hazard so you would end up in an institution.  Tl;dr: a mentally ill person can be charged for a crime, he has to be certified insane. Will end up in an institution instead.   Also the insanity defence only applies to certain crimes (mostly physical violence). You would have to get pretty creative to say you committed criminal breach of trust/fraud due to an illness of the mind."

tifu,3dg3gk,Cunt_Bag,13,Thu Jul 16 00:59:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly it, the only way they're ever going to have any semblance of normalcy is by modifying their behaviour into less toxic ways. Instead of just giving him an ipad and to hell with everything else."
tifu,3dg3gk,QuantumDrej,4,Thu Jul 16 06:50:11 2015 UTC,"I volunteered at a facility for special needs adults (18+, I think) one summer. The employees there didn't abuse the residents or anything, but neither did they take any of their shit. They were punished for deliberately acting up, given distractions, put in ""time out"", ect. I was surprised to learn that the youngest girl there, about 18-20, used to bite and scratch. When I met her, she was as sweet as could be. I hate the whole idea of treating the mentally ill like precious babies - they know when their behavior is unacceptable."

tifu,3dg3gk,automaticdream,15,Thu Jul 16 03:15:59 2015 UTC,Disability worker here - absolutely agree.  There's often a lack of understanding involved about what they're doing and even their own limitations (there aren't many). Have you been to any courses on how to manage aggressive behavior? I mean in the physical sense of the behavior. We have regular training that is pretty much a self-defense course tailored to dealing with mentally and physically disabled. You have to protect yourself - I don't think the fuck up is all on you OP.

If it was to the point where you even allowed him to keep his iPad during the day, the ymca staff knew you were in a bad position. Aggression from disruption of routine is a symptom of autism.

Backstory (optional): She is a retired grade 2 teacher and at the time of her story inclusion in the classroom was a big deal. Didn't matter if your child was mentally challenged to the point of preventing everyone else's education due to the amount of attention they needed. They had to be ""involved"". Story: Kid with severe autism/Asperger's acts up and is disrupting class more than usual so she tries to calm him down and handle the situation properly as she had the training and knew how. The kid bit her arm hard enough to break the skin and she had to go to hospital to get it looked at. Ended up needing it wrapped for 1 or 2 weeks waiting for it to heal and the swelling to go down. This was not the first violent display this child had and he was clearly getting worse but they had to continue ""including"" him because he had ""special needs"" and removing him from the classroom to ensure a safe education is apparently out of the question."

We get Japanese PE (but run a mile not a km during fitness tests wtf), a shit ton of exchange programs, and of course, a lot of retards, ADHDs (I'm one of them), LD, and autistic kids. Oh, and the school needs to support the Faculty of Education, so we get more brats children of rich and/or powerful parents.  Basically the fucking geniuses get special attention, the kids with severe conditions (autism and LD) get helped and experimented on (special tutors and stuff, no injections or weird drugs). The rest of us? Constant fighting and shit. Nobody cared. Until ...  When I was in Grade 12 (this school teaches all grades, because long-term studies stuff), there was a declaration of war. The worst shitheads of G12 will fight against the brutes of G11. To the death. I tried to laugh it off, but then we got a notice that a massive cache of weapons was found just outside the school. Some greenhouse and workshop tools (we have farming and carpentry classes) were moved. Yes, this is real life, not Murderous Koukousei no Monogatari Battle Plus (obviously made up anime name) story.  I would have been less mad if they wanted to fight other schools to the death. Good thing the damn bloodbath got discovered and shut down. We could still hear a small fireworks going bang once or twice an hour for the rest of the year, though.  And good thing I got out of this shit life when I discovered some really good friends in Grade 10. A bit fucking late, but I still managed to get on the honor roll during my last years of school life.  Yes, these retards are fucking dangerous when put together, unguided, in toxic environment.

Love is a weird thing and no one really does it right.   Take some condolence in this:   1) You made the attempt  2) You gained experience  3) You can definitely laugh at this later. Even use it in the future.   4) Also sounds like you've got a pretty decent friend that's willing to show up to some random 'group thing' to meet some random girls with ya  Again, don't beat yourself up Bilbo. In highschool I was incredibly socially inept, also looked like Frodo. But people grow, mature. Gain confidence and understanding. All of this comes from experience, which you jut got a nice dose of.   Keep it up, that's all Id say. The old moniker ""Practice makes perfect"" stands true for social interactions too. Fuck it man, youre probably looking for some shit jobs (I just mean entry/first jobs) right now too? Look into some that FORCE social interactions on you. Might suck at first but its worth. When you start to grasp that tons people are super insecure, and that few if any are devoid of insecurities, it kind of takes the fear out of those social situations.  Any way, hope this helped. And as for that future use, one day you will tell that story to another girl and she'll love it. Not soon though, keep that one.   Edit:Formatting and other reddittyyy stuff"

Me and the other female roommate were sitting a room away from the bathroom and couldn't deal with the mustiness. I fail negotiations and end up being the one who had to take it to the washing machine.   I picked it up halfway down. It stood up straight. It was bath sheet sized. I'm still not okay, a decade later."

Even if your clothes don't smell straight away the will after a few days of no washing. Air drying doesn't get rid of the smell either. And if you've left wet clothes in the machine for too long even getting that smell out is hard.

tifu,3dgaki,dimethylTRAPtamine,33,Thu Jul 16 03:43:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, the wasp didn't release any pheromones. The difference between a bee and a wasp is that the wasp doesn't have a barb on it's stinger. The stinger smoothly pierces the target's flesh and exits again, allowing the wasp to sting multiple times and escape. A bee will sting as a last resort to take out the target and protect the queen. A wasp will sting your ass if you look at it wrong, because it knows it can fuck you up and fly away to tell the tale to his little fucker wasp friends.   Can you tell I hate these things?

tifu,3dhtsp,vanitypridelust,2,Thu Jul 16 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think it was more the initial raw reaction.   She's probably ok by now.   I've known her since she was little and there's alot of trust and good history in place.  But if her NRA  membership-having dad invites me hunting this weekend there's no freakin' way I'm going.  About the charcoal, I dumped my hot coals out of the coal-starter last weekend, and a couple of them landed on the grilling surface instead of falling inside.   So I tapped them with my spatula to get them in with the other coals, but I knocked one out of the grill as my wife was walking by.  It didn't burn her at all, but melted the front of her right sandal a little bit - in addition to startling the crap out of her.    Boobies and hot coals.  I'm a walking fucking disaster."
