Really cool that you can dial in the wedges from the musician's spot! How does your ipad communicate with the board? Does the board generate it's own wifi or something?  Cool pic :)
Audiomemes,3d3m4p,Rokman2012,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:48:07 2015 UTC,"FOH is the venue mix.   I bring a wireless router to my gigs. I plugged the network cable into the network port on the console. I connected to my wifi and then opened the consoles iPad app. This one was called yamaha stage mix. When that opens you assign the same IP address that the board has. Something like 192.168.1.1. Takes just a couple of minutes to get up and running.   I set the gain, eq, gates, and comps during my line check. I spend about 20-60 seconds per channel depending on what kind of processing it needs. Once I get everything up and I know the channels are working I ran down and did monitors from my iPad. After that they ran a few songs. The balcony sounds very different than the floor. So I set basic volume levels and messed with the eqs some on the first song. Our subs are on an aux. The balcony is very sub heavy so I set that level from the floor. Checked in with the band for more monitor tweaks. And then went upstairs to take this picture."
Audiomemes,3d3m4p,MentalWarfar3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:54:38 2015 UTC,Do you ever peruse the crowd area when all the people are in the room and tweak?   Does the 'mix' sound different when the room is full?

The number of times I have heard ""we're out of time, we'll figure out the mix during the first couple of songs"" is ... too damn high. Turning up your guitar amp cos you cant hear yourself is the dumbest non-solution there is, but sometimes it's all you can do.  *just recently I recorded a drummer who just would not play at performance level when I set the mic levels, no matter how ofter I pointed it out.

I currently work for Sweetwater's main competition as a pro account manager, and the people that call me directly generally get a much better deal than if they purchased directly from the website.   Also, certain companies work off of different margin structures, so certain reps are able to give better prices than others (for instance, some sales guys worry more about gross sales, where as others worry more about margin).  In any case, at least for people that come to me, if a customer brings me a legitimate quote, I'll match or beat it.  Again, it all depends on who you shop with.  I'd post more info, but I don't want to come across as spammy for myself.  tl;dr If you buy a lot of gear, find a rep and stick with him/her, and you'll usually get rewarded for it."

Audiomemes,35f4gm,GrantNexus,2,Tue May 12 06:59:09 2015 UTC,Oh man I love that I get this!! I feel your pain man!
Audiomemes,35f4gm,TheSanelli,2,Sun May 10 03:45:51 2015 UTC,Been there....  Done that
Audiomemes,35f4gm,Ghoppe2,4,Wed May 13 20:58:47 2015 UTC,How do you not notice a track was soloed?
Audiomemes,35f4gm,creamersrealm,9,Sat May 9 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"In about 95% of the calls I get for ""not hearing anything out of the speakers"" it's one or a combination of those things, so my brain just kinda defaults to checking those things first."
Audiomemes,35f4gm,Distraction182,2,Sat May 9 21:26:44 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
Audiomemes,35db1v,fletch44,9,Sat May 9 05:18:18 2015 UTC,"What i usually say is ""go play a verse and a chorus and then tell me what you are missing""  Works almost every time."
Audiomemes,35db1v,BoukeBrink,7,Sat May 9 09:21:07 2015 UTC,"""What are you sending me?""  ""Equal energy across all octaves....you know...a bit of everything."""
Audiomemes,35db1v,tellhimhesdreaming,12,Tue May 12 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, as a drummer myself, I'm always playing off the entire band and I like being able to hear everyone, so I understand this. As a monitor guy you just gotta bring your front of house sensibilities in there and be able to give the drummer a well-balanced mix of everything.  I played on inears here and there and I was always like ""If you can just give me a copy of the FOH mix that'd be the easiest."""
Audiomemes,35db1v,solomute,6,Sat May 9 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly I find that request to be a pain. Usually it's not very easy to give the actual FOH mix to a monitor send. They could be two different consoles without enough return lines set up. Or even from the same console, it's not like the master buss has auxes on it usually... sure you could use a matrix but you'd have to re-patch your desk... With digital you could do some valuable group magic but still.   Why not just go through the inputs you need with an up / down hand signal and knock it out in a few seconds? Usually monitor boards and monitor engineers are much more prepared for this method."
Audiomemes,35db1v,pchc_lx,3,Sat May 9 16:27:11 2015 UTC,"Whenever I get this request, I just send every channel to them at the same level and set them to post fader. It definitely gets more tricky though with a monitor console."
Audiomemes,35db1v,JKisner,2,Sat May 9 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"Then you get the keyboard player on the far side of the drummer : ""turn the #$*!ing drum fill down!!"" :)"
Audiomemes,35516c,Snowblxnd,4,Thu May 7 04:00:20 2015 UTC,This needs to be made into a greentext.
Audiomemes,35516c,RotmgCamel,1 point,Thu May 7 07:42:38 2015 UTC,"How loud are these really? I was interested in getting one, but do they have enough volume for small/medium gigs?"
Audiomemes,35516c,joeribraams,3,Fri May 8 00:02:16 2015 UTC,"They can get pretty damn loud. Not enough for live performance with a full band I think (unless you mic the cab), but don't let the size or the wattage fool you into thinking it's quiet."
Audiomemes,35516c,fuzeebear,1 point,Fri May 8 03:09:38 2015 UTC,Alright thanks man!
Audiomemes,35516c,joeribraams,1 point,Fri May 8 09:47:24 2015 UTC,I second this... Damn thing screams yet will not be suitable without mixing when a drum set is present
Audiomemes,34v2iy,MrProfDrDickweed,4,Mon May 4 20:21:16 2015 UTC,What does the wave say?
Audiomemes,34v2iy,DigitallyAborted,8,Mon May 4 20:28:03 2015 UTC,I love you
Audiomemes,34v2iy,Runaway_5,20,Mon May 4 20:31:53 2015 UTC,"gay  Just kidding, as a producer that's an awesome idea. I would get a pryda snare though because I'm a gr8 producer"
Audiomemes,34v2iy,Camsy34,3,Mon May 4 22:13:54 2015 UTC,I guessed it was saying I love you! That's really cute/cool. What was the process you went through to get it made? :)
Audiomemes,34v2iy,BudSigur,4,Mon May 4 23:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yea no problem, I recorded her and then screen shotted the waveform from protools and there is a company called larson jewlers that specializes in custom engraving and I upload them image and got my ring about a week later"
Audiomemes,34v2iy,fuzeebear,2,Mon May 4 23:48:19 2015 UTC,What a cool idea! If I ever get married I might do the same thing...
Audiomemes,34v2iy,flyer716,2,Mon May 25 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"This is such a hackneyed idea. Hilarious.  What's even more funny is when these rings were posted in /r/pics and a bunch of people were claiming you can decipher words by looking at pictures waveforms - which you cannot.  EDIT: I just realized this sounds more critical of the ring design than I intended it to. If you like your ring, don't let me rain on your parade."
Audiomemes,34v2iy,fuzeebear,8,Mon May 4 23:24:52 2015 UTC,"I remember people (on this sub?) screaming in agony (well, not really you get the point) because that ring had some DC offset"
Audiomemes,34v2iy,Elliot850,5,Mon May 4 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"Which is equally funny, because there's no way to tell if there is DC offset because there's no visible indication of 0 V~."
Audiomemes,34v2iy,davef,2,Tue May 5 00:18:36 2015 UTC,There doesn't have to be a visible line for offset to be obvious.  http://www.hpfriedrichs.com/radioroom/cu-diode/images/lightson.jpg

Audiomemes,34gx82,scott003,7,Fri May 1 01:32:29 2015 UTC,You must have one of those crappy digital cars that lack the good analog drive you could get from analog pream- I mean cars.

Audiomemes,34gx82,Thor_Odinson_,4,Fri May 1 06:58:10 2015 UTC,"Current automatic transmissions actually tend to save more gas than manuals. This wasn't always true, but better computer control has made it such in most circumstances."
