HerStoryGame,3e1ubq,Vorpal_Kitten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:35 2015 UTC,"I think the baby is sort of screwed anyways, but the theory that Eve killed Hannah is viable - without much solid evidence, though. It's hinted at earlier that Eve might've murdered before (her step-mom and later the real parents - suspiciously dying by eating poisonous mushrooms that they knew were poisonous) and she does sort of make an ominous statement towards the end that Hannah is gone now. A little too calmly perhaps? I can accept it, at least."
HerStoryGame,3e1ubq,Nemokles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:55:14 2015 UTC,"There's also the hate that flashes when Hannah talks about holding eves head under water at the beach, and the song eve sings about two sisters, one who drowns the other."
HerStoryGame,3e1ubq,preflightsiren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"You know, I like this theory now. Fits so well with the song and the song is clearly a metaphor for the story itself."
HerStoryGame,3dtodj,andreasdr,2,Sun Jul 19 10:23:59 2015 UTC,"The most clear indication of this is when she spills coffee and takes off her shirt on 1/7, thus showing her tattoo. Whether or not Eve spills her coffee intentionally, she doesn't seem at all bothered by showing her tattoo to the police. She also doesn't seem to mind telling the police that the tattoo is eight years old, even though she must know that that piece of information completely shatters the illusion that Hannah and Eve are one and the same person.   Right, see, that makes a whole ton of sense if it's really just Hannah trying to get away with murder - she gets the tattoo to make a rock solid alibi to go along with her carefully crafted story that's so insane no one would ever make it up.  edit: Do we ever see Hannah with a tattoo free arm by the way? I don't recall that, and isn't whoever it is claiming to be Hannah on the coffee spill day? If not, why wouldn't the police immediately freak out aout the tattoo not being eight years old."
HerStoryGame,3dtodj,Vorpal_Kitten,3,Tue Jul 21 07:49:06 2015 UTC,"Why do you think the tattoo is fresh? It doesn't look so to me and the fact that the police do not call her out on it (as evidenced by her not answering any such questions). Besides, this makes no sense as a way to get away with murder and doesn't explain things like the bruise, the trips to Glasgow, etc. She is going to get locked up for covering it up and generally taking part in the murder anyways."
HerStoryGame,3dtodj,Nemokles,2,Tue Jul 21 11:22:34 2015 UTC,"It is of course worth re-evaluating whether the girl interviewed on July 1 is really Eve, but I think there is just way too much evidence to support the idea that it is. Remember, on July 3, Eve (it's very likely her) mentions that Simon made a comment on the tattoo when they met in the bar. She also said that she got the tattoo when she moved out from Hannah's and Simon's place and got a bedsit.  Yes! We see Hannah without a tattoo both on June 25 and June 30. And yes, Eve is more or less claiming to be Hannah all the way up to, but not including, July 3.  I agree, it is very strange that the police doesn't confront her about the tattoo it right away, but that says nothing about what Hannah/Eve is thinking. Perhaps the police silently realizes right then that the other girl is the guilty one, and that she is the one they want to ask the hard questions. But that would require the police to be very quick-witted!"
HerStoryGame,3dtodj,CorneliusCoffin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:59:59 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I think that's a version we can rule out entirely, because of the lie detector test.  There are only two ways that Eve would pass the lie detector test:   Eve is real and everything she says is true.  Hannah has a double identity disorder but geniuinly believes everything she says while acting as ""Eve"" to be true.    Had Hannah made up her story, she'd have failed the lie detector test.   I also fail to see a ""carefully crafted story"" in what Hannah is supposed to have made up.   Does she pretend to be two people? If so, she must certainly know that she will be found out after giving finger prints for a second time. If she is indeed a rationally thinking human being, it doesn't make any sense for her to keep up the act afterwards, let alone go through a lie detection test.  Or does she pretend to be clinically insane? Which makes even less sense, because she'd get locked up anyway."
HerStoryGame,3dtodj,Vorpal_Kitten,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:12:27 2015 UTC,"There are only two ways that Eve would pass the lie detector test   Lie detector tests are notoriously unreliable though, even beyond being possible to screw with if you know how.   because she'd get locked up anyway   Right, but she would get less time if she then slowly walked back her fake mental illness."
HerStoryGame,3dtodj,Nemokles,2,Wed Jul 22 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that whether she meant to screw up or did so accidentally is up to interpretation, but I agree with everything you write, essentially."
HerStoryGame,3dtodj,Kodaisa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:27:05 2015 UTC,"i think, that they work together all the way, but after the Tattoo was shown on 1/7 they kinda knew that their Story wouldnt work. So on 2/7 Hannah only goes back to give them evidence that she is Hannah and by this make sure they will be able to prove the day after, that there are actually two different persons being interviewed. Like her Fingerprints will match the Fingerprints at her House and the ones that were taken on day 2 and stuff but not Eve's. She seems to know the laws well enough to be sure they cant arrest her (yet). After that Hannah immediately ""vanishes"". Like she is taking the Role of Eve who never had an identity.  on 3/7 Eve comes back to tell the whole Story, because she knows that a lie detector or DNA tests or anything would not be able to show her being guilty, because she isnt. So she explains everything, proceeds to call a lawyer in the end and has in mind that they will be able to prove that she is not Hannah who killed Simon. Different fingerprints, lie detector wont work either. She can basically prove that she is just a random woman without an identity. And the police will only be able to arrest ""Hannah Smith"", not ""random chic that does exist"".   Their behaviour during the last 2 Days is the only possible way to maybe get out of it without anyone being put into jail. So ideally both of them got out of that mess without being arrested, Eve has her daughter and they come back 20 years later to explain everything to Sarah."
HerStoryGame,3djxq3,murica_dream,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"I can't accept theory #2 and #3 for the simple reason that if we apply logic like this to the game, it ruins the entire narrative of the game and makes it so that anything can be a lie, meaning that it's meaningless to try to discern any truth out of this - we're just being told tall tales  a liar the entire time.   It is clear to me from the way the game is built up that the later videos contain the truth, just in such short snippets that you need to watch a bunch of them to really figure it out.   This is why we have the rule of only being able to see the first five results for each search - so that we'll have to be clever and do targeted searches to get to the later clips revealing the truth and solution to us.  Also, look at what we're not being directly told, but indirectly shown through the responses; the interviewer clearly does not question the later answers as they do the earlier ones - they fit with their investigations. Why is there no ""No, but I am a different person!"" video towards the end, but earlier on she is reluctant to give fingerprints?  It's fun to spin theories, but it becomes a little too ad hoc where we invent little theories to explain this and that fact/statement to make our own theories sound more plausible, while all the while forgetting the larger implications this has for the story and the game - it quickly becomes pointless."
HerStoryGame,3djxq3,Nemokles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:40:35 2015 UTC,"Hang on there, nobody is in jail. In the very last video of the very last day, Eve actually asks if she is being arrested now.   Now, you might argue that ""Eve"" thinks she's free to leave because of the personality disorder. However, a crucial part of the DID (dissociative identity dissorder)-theory is that Hannah got her tattoo (real or fake, doesn't matter in this case) between 30/6/94 and 1/7/94. That would not have been (realistically) possible had she been in jail.  Next, you might argue that MAYBE then they are different people and they're either both locked up or one of them is locked up. I think we can disregard the latter option pretty quickly, because they're obviously sharing information about the interviews with each other, which is nigh impossible if one of them is locked up, while the other remains free. The fact that they are communicating with each other also eliminates the possibilty that they are being locked in seperate places without knowing that the other one is in jail as well. If Hannah was in jail and Eve was in jail, then Hannah would know that Eve was in jail and vice. More crucial though: Hannah would also know that the police knew about Eve. So she'd have no reason to lie about Eve's existence, like she does.  TL:DR: No Matter if you believe in DID-theory or ""twin""-theory, Hannah and Eve are definitely not in jail. Since the rest of the argument is based on that assumption, it does not hold any longer.  One more minor other point I have with your reasoning is that I disagree with the assessment that the police would have to let Eve go if they found 2 sets of fingerprints. First, because we don't know if that isn't exactly what happens. And second because even though she didn't kill Simon, she still conspired to cover up the murder."
HerStoryGame,3de15l,Ninto55,4,Wed Jul 15 15:17:40 2015 UTC,Think of it from the perspective of the character. You know enough to get the story. You are 'satisfied' but you probably will dig around to find every clip. There's no requirement though.
HerStoryGame,3de15l,hobbbz,2,Wed Jul 15 15:36:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that is how I'm thinking about it, but I use that same logic to justify not playing any further.

Compared to Her Story, it's a bit more video-gamey (locked doors and stuff), and the main story is more overt: found audio clips basically explain the story, and the game cuts to credits when you find the last one. However! there is a side story that is less clear, harder to find, and basically has no concrete ending (like Her Story).

It's a virtual novel game, and contains porn, which will obviously keep some people from playing it, but beyond the porn there's a deep and weird/interesting story. Unlike Her Story there are a bunch of completely different endings, since you get to affect the player characters actions instead of just hearing about the past.  Also, there's the Stanley Parable, which seems to have almost nothing to do with Her Story, beyond being a similarly 'arty' short indie game heavily dependent on voice work over 'gameplay'"

I don't think they could've faked that, there is real evidence of it happening. Eve living in the attic unnoticed for so long is a bit of a plot hole, but I think they would switch places quite frequently, meaning Eve attended school etc. as Hannah.

The game is obviously built up so that you are gradually given clues to the truth after initially being lied to. This is also why you're limited to five videos per search, so you're not likely to stumble upon the later videos without targeted searches. The whole Glasgow trip is a central thing in this, as it changes from an alibi when the interviewer think they are one person to not making sense when you discover they are not and, in the end, you learn the truth."

That's their whole deal.  Why they would constantly switch places is a mystery and how they would trick their parents after years is far fetched, but I'm willing to accept it because it's a story. Personally, I think a split personality is just as far fetched (despite its common use in fiction).

HerStoryGame,3buhp1,animoscity,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:47 2015 UTC,I guess that's the point of the game. They provide just enough info for each theory (of twins or multiple personalities) to be plausible. And by cutting the interviews into short clips and mixing it up it makes it all much more confusing. But I watched all the interviews in chronological order and I can totally see both sides of the argument. It's slightly irritating that there's no definitive answer XD
HerStoryGame,3buhp1,Vorpal_Kitten,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"After reading a few theories I see people bringing up the tattoo for being multiple people. It's clearly a fake tattoo, and not there all the time. I'm going with the multiple personalities theory. To me it just fits."

HerStoryGame,3bos1a,nluqo,3,Wed Jul 1 01:34:31 2015 UTC,Nice work! Any chance we could get a higher quality pic so the notes are readable?
HerStoryGame,3bos1a,shutdownMPLS,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"quick note about something i noticed. When we see the lady with the tattoo we assume she is Eve. but at the end of the interview she says quite sternly that no one killed her husband because of cheating on expenses. Eve is not married to simon, Hannah is. so that woman with the tattoo must be Hannah, not Eve as we thought? That is assuming that you think hannah and eve are two seperate people."
HerStoryGame,3bos1a,passionfyre,3,Thu Jul 2 05:46:41 2015 UTC,"So, the idea is that this is Eve pretending to be Hannah. The tattoo is one of the clues that lead investigators to start questioning if there was another person in the first place. Hannah and Eve started switching places, and we know that Hannah doesn't have a tattoo (in the white, she is drinking a ton of coffee, but Eve, in the Red, says she can't drink too much because of the baby, and we know that Eve is the pregnant one)."
HerStoryGame,3bos1a,Tholo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:37:57 2015 UTC,The theory that it's multiple personalities would still stand tho. Hannah would drink lots of coffee because she believes she is not pregnant. Eve would not because she knows she is. The tattoo could be fake. I've heard some people say that she covered it with makeup in previous interviews but is that possible with such a dark image?
HerStoryGame,3bos1a,passionfyre,2,Thu Jul 2 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"I totally think multiple personality is a valid theory, I am just saying that the lady with the Tattoo is definitely Eve- whether or not Eve is an aspect of Hannah is still up for debate."
HerStoryGame,3bos1a,Tholo,2,Thu Jul 2 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"although the dev left it ambiguous, I still lean towards the twins since there are things that wouldn't makes sense if Hannah and Eve are the same person. -the bruise. Not only does Eve not have the bruise, but she also touches the wrong cheek. -the extra set of fingerprints found in the house. -the tattoo.  Eve also mentions twice she got it years ago. -Eve took Hannah's virginity with a hairbrush. If they are the same person, this can't really happen. -When Hannah got pregnant, Eve tried to get knocked up by sleeping around, but only ended up getting STD. If they both share the same body, Eve would also get pregnant.    To be clear, I'm not saying the multiple personality theory is wrong. I think the beauty of this game is that you can't make full conclusions and a lot of points are open to different interpretations. We'll never know for sure what really happened unless the developer answers those questions, but it's nice to read about other people's viewpoints."
HerStoryGame,3bos1a,dattroll123,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"While I currently subscribe to the Twins theory, some of your points can definitely be refuted by the Two Minds version of events.  The hairbrush incident could be a created memory. There are many times when Hannah/Eve talks about interacting with the other directly, eg. Changing clothes in the cinema bathroom. These types of memories occur over and over throughout the interviews, and could act as a way for the mind to contextualise the dual personalities existing in it. It could also be a way for her to lend narrative in her own mind to why neither of them are virgins. None of the events that cause them to sync up, black eyes as kids, hair cuts, losing teeth, happen in the company of anyone by Hannah/Eve. Whether Hannah/Eve believes the stories, or whether they are made up to create the illusion of twins is also up for argument.  Hannah and Eve seem to believe, or at least used to believe themselves to be different people, so when Hannah got pregnant, Eve believed that she had not. In order to remedy this, she slept around in order to sync up with Hannah and keep up their ruse. She could not get pregnant because her body was already pregnant. She claimed to be sick from an STD, but that could very well just have been the morning sickness that her body was suffering from. Eve never clarifies the type of STD as far as I know, only that she was sick for a long time from it. This also explains why Hannah (on tape in orange, and still up for debate) suffers morning sickness when Eve was the one pregnant from Simon, and why in the end the women decide to do 'what's best for the baby'.  All of this can be argued with counterpoints or alternate readings of course, but thats the beauty (or endless frustration) of Her Story."
HerStoryGame,3bos1a,KaChilde,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the biggest one, which is that Eve probably killed their parents with death caps, while Hannah had zero motive to do so (and lived separately at the time)  Also there's no way Eve mistook 8 months pregnant as an STD. At least not as a 'genuine' second personality."
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,TonyStellato,6,Tue Jun 30 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"I'll believe that Eve killed Florence, their parents, even Hannah's first child. But I don't understand for one moment what motivation she would have to kill Hannah. They love each other, right?  She obviously is trying to indicate something by ""My sister is gone. She's never coming back"" but this could just as easily imply she's fled the country. SPOILERS FOR THE PRESTIGE... This seems to be a similar thing for what happens in The Prestige (which I strongly suspect influenced Her Story). One of the twins is hanged, but the other one goes on living.  I don't think Eve would have raised Sarah. The most logical thing is that she's been in prison for her role in this murder. At an appropriate age, she would have been told something about her mother and she'd obviously be curious by age 21 what happened.  I'm also not too convinced by the theory that Hannah and Eve are the same person. Not because of the bruise and tattoo (after all, these were implemented as makeup in real life, so the in game character could do the same) or because of anything she says (which could all be lies). Rather, it would make a large portion of the game rather meaningless and I find it hard to believe that was the designer's intent."
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,nluqo,2,Tue Jun 30 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"yeah, the murdered Hannah thing didn't make too much sense to me. I thought maybe Hannah got life in prison or something, and Eve got off by providing a testimony, hence the lie detector test. But that's just a guess at best. I also am not convinced with the ""same person"" theory."
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,lon6,0,Tue Jun 30 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"the thing got me to the same person theory (and I'm a bit sad about it) was the synopsys of the game that tells you that it's 7 interviews from ""A"" brittish woman across several months, so the game pretty much tells you it's the same person.  that's the one thing I found infuriating in an amazing concept, as soon as, either by luck, or smart thinking, you get to notice it's two different persons, the fact that in the game resume you know it's the same woman, gets you right to the ending (multiple personality disorder and one of the personality commited the crime while either the other one wasn't aware, or was dead already and eve pretended she was hannah the whole time). the fact that you get the information in a disjointed way is a nice touch, but if you get lucky it kinda breaks the experience (that happened to me and I spent the rest of the game trying to find the good keywords to get to the end)"
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,Shawken,6,Wed Jul 1 22:27:00 2015 UTC,I don't think you should put so much into the synopsis of the game. The creator couldn't very well reveal a big twist in the synopsis by writing 2 persons could he? :)

HerStoryGame,3bo88n,Ethereal_Muse,3,Tue Jul 21 08:17:30 2015 UTC,"The way that I understand the bit where Eve kills Hannah is that Hannah ruined Eve's only chance of living her ""own"" life. For years, Hannah lived her own separate (and happy) life with Simon and Eve did not like that. She tried to take Simon away from her (wearing her blonde wig knowing that he has an affinity  for blondes) in an attempt to bring her and her sister back together.  However, she ends up falling in love with Simon. Simon also ends up loving Eve more than he ever loved Hannah (and who knows, Eve could have been the one he fell in love with in the first place). Once Hannah tells Simon about her sister, her pregnancy, and her needing a place to live, it all clicks together for Simon. It all comes together for Hannah as well.   This is when Hannah impersonates Eve and gets Simon's confession, and in her fit of rage murders him. Eve comes back to try to apologize and sees the scene. Because of her overwhelming love for her sister, she helps to hide the body and do anything she can to protect her.  But then she begins to think. It's evident during her interviews where she is pretending to be Hannah that she loved Simon the whole time. More than she ever loved her sister. So in between the last two interviews, Eve kills Hannah out of jealousy for taking away the one thing she ever loved (which coincidentally is what Eve did to Hannah her whole life).   This is why she makes such strange remarks in her last interview about her sister being gone and there not being a murder weapon.  Sarah is born while Eve is in prison, and she is named in honor of her Aunt Hannah. ""SB"" is just a contact that Sarah has (it's either a journalist or someone working in the police station)."

HerStoryGame,3bo88n,ad_maru,3,Tue Jul 21 08:20:41 2015 UTC,"Simon's death timeline from my perspective:   Friday. Hannah's birthday. Simon and Hannah dinner together. He gives her the first mirror. Hannah tells Simon about Eve, how they swapped places in the past, the fact that now her twin sister is pregnant from a random guy she met at the bar, and that she   wants her to move in.  Simon gets that he is the random guy. I think Hannah gets it too. They fight. Simon flees, furious, to the pub. There, he has a lot to think about.  Hannah calls Eve. She comes. Hannah tells her what happened. They fight. Eve looses her wig. She flees to Glasgow.  Simon comes back home. There, he finds Hannah as Eve. He has a decision to make. He says to her he accepts Eve. Maybe he even chooses her over Hannah. He has a spare mirror. Or he was already thinking about giving the second mirror to Eve.  Then, the murder happens."
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,andreasdr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's my understanding too. When Hannah tells Simon about Eve's baby, Simon is visibly shocked, since Eve hasn't told him that. Hannah in turn realizes from Simon's reaction that Simon is the father, and is not happy."
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,dattroll123,2,Sun Jul 19 09:33:54 2015 UTC,"The only time ""Sarah"" is mentioned is when Hannah talked about her miscarriage. She was going to name the child Sarah. I pretty sure she killed her parents with the mushrooms but I dont think she killed Hannah.  From what I understand is that Hannah accidentally killed Simon and Eve is covering for her. Eve took Hannah's place in the interrogations when Simon's body was discovered. Her plan is to fool the cops with the identity switch thing.  Even if the cops figured she's the twin, Hannah would still be able to escape. Eve figures they can't arrest her since she has no identity (Florence raised her in the attic and no one knew she existed) I wish i could figure out the keywords for the lie detector test...."

HerStoryGame,3bo88n,ad_maru,2,Mon Jul 6 09:22:08 2015 UTC,"My theory about the ""Hannah is gone forever"" portion:   Since Eve doesn't officially exists, she's arrested as Hannah. The real Hannah probably left the country. Sarah probably was raised by Simon's parents, as Hannah's daughter.  The detective of the case doesn't have evidences to prove what happened (Florence's diary was burned. Probably there is a lot of documents of Hannah with Eve's fingerprints. Sarah really is daughter of Simon and Eve, so a DNA test is proof of nothing. And the video testimonies are only stories). But he decides to tell Sarah the truth anyway.  The flaw in my theory is: why Eve and Hannah swapped places while talking to the police? It would be better if Hannah left the country while Eve dealt with everything. But yet, there is no weapon. I don't even know if Eve was arrested. Maybe it's all about telling Sarah why she lost her father. Or the person on the chat is actually the real Hannah with a fake ID............"
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,malpighien,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:14:25 2015 UTC,"I skimmed through the game a little fast and did pay close attention to the videos but at some point I was under the impression that Eve and Hannah are the same person, Even being Hannah's imaginary twin who would supposedly have her opposite personality. She talks a lot about palindrome, mirrors and reflection. both are similar and sometimes opposite. Obviously there is the issue of the bruise, one has it on the left cheek while the other has it on the right cheek. There is also the matter of the tattoo, which will be hard to hide (but not impossible) and again I did not pay attention very well to the interviews together but I assume it is supposed to match the supposed Eve. In the story there are times when it would be hard for Hannah to be where Eve is supposed to be, like at the bar to meet Simon or in Glasgow, or in Oxford, but maybe she managed it somehow. But does the speeding ticket showed that it was her car, was there really an accident with a taxi or a car, are there really record of her going to the hospital. Probably the biggest issue would be that the police must have tried to gather them together at some point or another and be certain that both are reals. There is also the story of the fingerprints and how one burned her hand (is it a hint to say she does not have any finger print).    To me the story of the midwife keeping the twin sister hidden in her house is too fairy tale like to be believed. Sure you can say that is the reason Eve is so attached to fairy tales stories, prince and princess, rapunzel and such but it could also be the proof that it is fake. Also their obsession to look alike (to the point of hitting themselves), or supposedly the tricks they would pull to be at the same place together and switch every so and then. It seems hardly possible and more some imaginative story she spun in her head. The idea that she could be hidden for years in the attic without her parents suspecting it, it is really really hard to believe. The fact that one pretends to like coffee no sugar, the other one like sugar (or tea or was it the first one), it seems childish ways to pretend there are two persons and that could go along the line that one killed the other but it feels more logical to me that there is only one person.     I think that when she says how she wanted to drown her sister at the beach, suddenly stop sharing Simon like before is a way to say that at this time of her life she was happy enough that she wanted to get ride of her fake twin persona. But when she lost her baby she might have gone psychotic again and recreated Eve (but that does not explain the food poisoning that lead to the miscarriage), possibly kill her parents to come back to the house where she pretended Eve existed and the infertility might be fake but she wanted a baby nonetheless except it had to be Eve's baby. It might be that she aborted herself voluntary because she was not happy anymore with her Hanna's persona or felt trapped with Simon with the years and fairy tale love story vanishing.  Not sure of why she killed Simon, was it an accident was it too much mixing between the two persona and he did not embrace the switch, did he need to die to fit in some crazy idea of the story Eve/Hannah had. I also read someone questioning Simon glasses and maybe another idea of duality there.     So I don't buy the twin possibility even if it seems there are physical proof of it and I think it is also because of the order I watched the videos which makes the game so fascinating."
HerStoryGame,3bo88n,lon6,0,Tue Jun 30 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"First of all, I haven't finished the game, but have a pretty good idea where this is going from what I've seen.  I believe there were twins, but one of them died (I'd guess eve) then, perhaps learning about her dead twin sister, hannah started to have a split personality disorder (hence the wig) and then they kept switching personalities while being aware of each other (which is rare in multiple personality disorder cases but happens) Eve seems the more aggressive one, so I guess she's the one who poisoned the parents and probably killed simon. the way the clips are presented is confusing. For me, I got to a clip, very early, where eve seems to be admitting to the personality disorder with the diary and another where she admits to have failed the polygraph when they asked her name (hannah smith) so my idea was pretty set from then on out, but since then I've kept trying to get to the resolution, and although I keep getting hints I'm getting closer (face on the screen and sirens) and I might be mistaken, but I still feel like I figured it out but the game won't let me end the case, although now the fun is trying to find the right combination of words to unlock everything"

But the developer himself has said that the game is really over when you're satisfied with your interpretation of the story. He deliberately did not want the game to have a rigid end state like most games do.  So, avoiding spoilers as much as I can, when you decide to end the game, there is a twist/revelation that will probably change the way you think about the clips you just watched, but nothing you will do in the game will change what happened back then, and the game is more about how you are interpreting the story yourself.

HerStoryGame,3bigi3,Sean_May,3,Mon Jun 29 18:04:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like the motive for what happened to Simon is the least important part of the story that gets told in the interviews.  Simon, in general, is really a very minor endcap to what is a very disturbing life story about the woman being interviewed."
HerStoryGame,3bewq4,ssfsx17,3,Sun Jun 28 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"The only reason that I consider Hannah/Eve are the same person is the name ""Eve"".  There was a really well known multiple personality disorder case about a woman with three personalities.  This was documented in an old movie ""The Three Faces of Eve"" IIRC..."
HerStoryGame,3bewq4,Addiam,2,Tue Jun 30 17:20:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for putting this together! I myself think that there's no way Eve and Hannah are not the same person, but I knew that both versions of the story had to make sense. The way you've laid it all out here is really nice. I actually like to remain a bit uncertain and kind of shift both versions of the stories over one another, looking through them both at what the ""truth"" would be. I like the idea that there is some borderline supernatural-y stuff going on with the tattoo, etc. that makes it hard to feel confident about the ""same person theory,"" and I think that Sarah will never really have ""one"" answer.  The only point where I would depart from this is that I think that Hannah killed Simon with the mirror. Maybe I've been tricked by Eve...but I can't see why Eve would be opposed to Simon accepting both of them. That's been her goal this whole time, right? It's Hannah who tried to hide Eve and separate her from her new life. Then again, Eve is the one who wants to ""express her individuality,"" so maybe she would be the one to be angered by the identical mirror gift."
HerStoryGame,3bewq4,Elaine_Benes_,4,Mon Jun 29 15:22:21 2015 UTC,"I used to think that the game left it open to both interpretations, but I'm very confident now that there are in fact two people. There's a few reasons why...  The bruise on her face during interview 2, disappears by interview 3. Not only does she give a poor reason for why it's gone ""she has a fast metabolism"", but when asked about it, she touches the wrong side of her face. She COULD have faked the bruise, or covered it with makeup, but the reasoning for why she would do that starts to feel very contrived...  Twins do not have exactly the same fingerprints. She gives her fingerprints to the detectives at one point. Later, the detectives ask her about fingerprints found in her house. They don't match the fingerprints she provided them, otherwise they wouldn't ask her about them. She suggests that they could be her parents, but it seems unlikely that they would have persisted that long after their death as she suggested..."
HerStoryGame,3bewq4,PsychoMunky,2,Wed Jul 1 15:29:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I wasn't sure how to interpret that fingerprints exchange, but your explanation makes sense. I thought that they were talking about missing fingerprints that should have been found in the house, but we know Hannah ""blitzed"" everything to remove all the evidence.  I used to think they could only be the same person, but after replaying the game with a friend of mine (we both teach college lit) and thinking about it, I've decided that the game purposefully holds the two stories in suspension. I think the key to it all is in the final clip (one of the first ones the game directs you to). When Hannah/Eve says, ""all the stories we've been telling each other? They're just that. Stories."" We can't trust 100% the story of Florence, or the story of Hannah/Eve, but both I think are meant to hang in the balance together...  ...but no matter what, you always have one ""primary"" story that you ""deep down"" believe in, whether it's two people or one person. And then the other theory sort of circles around the one you ""feel"" is right and they feed off of each other. But I think the game has purposefully been designed to foil any attempt to eliminate one of the theories. There are the facts that Simon is dead and that this woman is responsible, but beyond that, all we have to go on are the stories that she tells us. I started out being 100% convinced in one ending but I now feel firmly that the game is all about interpretation and about how the stories you choose to believe/remember shape you. Are you more psychological/practical? You might believe they're the same person, and that it's just impractical to believe that a girl could hide in a family's house for decades unnoticed. Are you focused on the contradictions between the interviews and the narratives and how these bits of evidence point to two separate people? Then you might believe that these contradictions prove it. But I think it's hard for one narrative to ""win"" out. Also, each narrative fills in information that you can't get from the other, so you need to allow yourself to at least temporarily believe in both possibilities to understand some parts of the timeline.  I think there are also narrative possibilities between these two stark ones--could Hannah be faking a personality disorder to absolve herself? Did Eve actually kill Hannah or let her escape?--but these are the two basic paths. Whichever one you decide to ""rest"" with for the moment is dominant. Makes me think back to the mirror game too, how impossible it is to balance two different players/narratives. One is always ahead, and there's always the chance that the other one might suddenly take over. If you watched the videos in a different order, or a different mood, you could come down on one narrative instead of the other. Anyway, this is my final interpretation. :)"

That (and the clips were eve always speaks in ""WE"" let me to go towards the split personality disorder instead of the twins covering for each other. also EVE seems to spend years in the attic which would be impossible and is more a metaphore for when Hannah takes over. just my opinion though"

This is a problem for them because they each have a first hand knowledge of only some of the events, whilst the rest of the time they only have the diary entries recorded by their sister. That's why they occasionally give ""rehearsed"" answers (they're repeating from memory what exactly was written down that day).  Towards the end, Eve looked like she'd given up with the premise. She knew there was enough uncertainty to protect both of them, but also was fatigued enough to keep up the charade (that had already been broken by the lie detector/tattoo/bruise)."

HerStoryGame,3bbviw,lon6,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:52:29 2015 UTC,"It might be for leading the investigators to 'twins' idea.  Either for 'Hannah and Eve are twins' or 'different personalities of a single woman', it could work.   /For twins theory: They wanted to make the police understand that they are twins, solve the crime which is mainly performed by Hannah and by the escape of her get away with it.  /For personality disorder theory: It basically is the same with previous one. There is one person who did kill his husband either intentionally or unintentionally. She shows up as both personalities in different occasions and gives some clues to the police about the twins idea. Then says that Hannah is gone. By blaming Hannah and becoming Eve totally, she could get away with murder. For this theory, the tattoo should be made between interviews, which is possible I think."
HerStoryGame,3bbviw,nartcan,6,Sat Jun 27 19:33:54 2015 UTC,"My thought was that the interviews weren't scheduled and they just came by and brought her down for questioning, so whoever answered was who came in."

I think it's what allows the game to work and I wrote a bit about the design here.   Personally I found Her Story to be a special experience. I described it to a friend as one of the most original gaming experiences I have had in recent years. It’s weird that a game that’s basically using a search engine to watch videos would have that sort of grip on me, yet here we are.   Yes! I'm still thinking about it. Still reading about the game anywhere I can find something (just found a good review with SB yesterday that I may post). Between all the genuine a-ha moments and the universe that is presented in the game, it is very special."

This is in regards to killing Hannah, not Simon like it is initially implied, because there is a murder weapon for Simon - the mirror.    If one sister killed the other, it may have been by drowning. Eve/Hannah mentions in one video how she once felt like drowning the other sibling out of anger. One sister even sings a creepy ballad about a fairytale sibling drowning another. Drowning leaves no ""murder weapon"" behind."

Probably worth looking into!  I agree that it's unclear whether Eve killed the parents (or Florence, which is too vague for me to even guess at), but my theory is that the parents' murder is committed by Eve as motivation to get Hannah to return to the house and resume their charade, since she was trapped living in the attic and could only leave in disguise."

HerStoryGame,3b9gv8,thelsdj,9,Sun Jun 28 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"Watching from beginning to end in order it really does feel like twins is the best explanation.  I feel like the overall presentation is coloring the expectations of some.  You expect grounded, gritty realism, however if this were a cartoon or a Phoenix Wright case, it would be easy to accept what we're presented with at more or less face value.  Yeah, it's outlandish as all hell that this midwife stole away a baby and raised her across the street for 8 years before she moved in with her real parents who over the next 9 years never realized she existed, but it's also fiction.  Outlandish fiction.  I have to say the way the reveal came about does bug me.  These two had an intricate system going for 9 years to stop even their own parents living in the same house from realizing there were two of them.  It's a bit of a stretch that when they needed to pull it off the most they didn't think of simple things like one having a visible bruise and the other having a huge tattoo.  The tattoo is somewhat excusable considering the spill, but she couldn't even come up with a semi-plausible lie about it once it was revealed?  I don't know.  Maybe they were out of practice after living separately for so long.  Maybe the pressure got to them.  I just wish the slips had been more subtle.  I actually don't think Eve has necessarily killed Hannah at the end, though.  The police really don't have a murder weapon.  They have the mirror he gave Hannah.  The one he gave ""Eve"" was presumably tossed along with Hannah's bloody clothing and any other obvious evidence of the murder.  I feel it's more likely that just as the police started asking questions about twins, they realized the jig was up, packed Hannah's bags and sent her into hiding, possibly assuming that Eve would have an easier time with the law, given that she didn't murder Simon."

She may have been reading fairy tales and after reading the diary and seeing her ""reflection"" felt like Florence was a wicked step mother.   Also, if Eve killed 4 people, maybe she killed Simon as well? Though I think the problem there is the motive, so maybe that one can stay pinned on Hannah."
HerStoryGame,3b9gv8,maninahat,8,Sat Jun 27 05:26:21 2015 UTC,"As well as the alibi - They used Eve's visit to the hospital in Glasgow during Simon's murder to get away with it. That said, the hospital visit is never explicitly confirmed as having been checked on, though we can assume that any detective worth his salt would have checked that.  I would agree that, honestly, my gut tells me she killed Florence. Thought of her as an ""evil witch"" and wanted to escape to her reflection. But the evidence is just a gut feeling, so I don't necessarily want to stake that claim."

HerStoryGame,3b9gv8,jswerve5,3,Mon Jun 29 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"Did Eve really give that bruise to Hannah, though? So many condemning things are deliberately said, by Eve especially, probably as clever smokescreen to provide fodder for the simplest theory. The tat and bruise could totally be cosmetically applied and later removed. I'm especially convinced of this because of how showy Eve is about it once it's displayed. She's constantly dropping nuggets like ""that rules me out, right?""...or ""that proves I couldn't have anything to do with it"". The more theories I read online, the more convinced I'm becoming that Hannah and Eve are the same person putting on an elaborate charade. The ambiguous lie detector video where she is asked her name... stands out in my mind. Now, when watching the videos, I'm more looking for proof to disprove this theory of a nefarious schizophrenic.

One part I was unsure on was who had really died - did Hannah kill Eve after Eve fucked up? Or was Eve a serial killer with four murders to her name?  One bit that throws a bit of a spanner in the works is the STD/Miscarriage angle. Because as I interpret it as being one of the girls is definitely infertile. The other one is definitely fertile, because the PC is Sarah, the daughter. Was the infertility caused by the STD, or the miscarriage? When Eve drove to Glasgow, she obviously got the baby checked out under the Hannah ID, as Eve ""doesn't exist"" in any system.   Also: is the whole ""Bad boy musician Carl"" thread a deadend/red herring? Is he linked to the STD, and the reason why (one of?) the girls can now play guitar...?"

Assuming the remaining clips about miscarriage/STD are true, the hospital record must surely have been aware they were treating a pregnant woman who was on file as being infertile?  Again, this is an unknowable tangent, and we have to assume that the off-screen police officers would have checked all that with the medical records too."

You're ""their"" daugther, piecing together why your mother killed your father. There's only one mother, there aren't any twins.  ""Eve"" even taps out the message ""BYE HANNAH"" in tap code, after you never see ""Hannah"" again."
HerStoryGame,3b9gv8,michaelzelen,2,Sat Jun 27 11:06:02 2015 UTC,"Do we know for sure that we never see Hannah after the tap code? She also could have just been typing an example phrase they would have used. Maybe it comes down to that question of whether Hannah actually has a split personality, or is consciously using her ""other self"" to commit and cover up for her crimes."
HerStoryGame,3b9gv8,monarc,2,Sat Jun 27 15:15:22 2015 UTC,I couldn't really make out the first taps. Does anybody have a definitive version?
HerStoryGame,3b9gv8,Barachiel1976,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:13:31 2015 UTC,"The first taps (from the interview with Hannah where she says ""Why are you talking about Eve?"") spells out LIVEU. The second one, when she's explaining what the code is, spells ""BYDHANNAN"". Which could be interpreted as ""BYEHANNAH"" misspelled (this is my theory as it lends a tiny bit more credence to the idea that Eve killed Hannah the night before), or ""BADHANNAH"", which could go either way but I think would lean more toward the split-personality theory (which I don't personally agree with)."
HerStoryGame,3baffa,Sparksman91,6,Sat Jun 27 08:59:42 2015 UTC,"I don't see any evidence for hallucinations. Despite some inherited mental disease by the mother or medication, but that's too much of speculation for my taste.  The game might be quite a mindfuck at times, but that doesn't necessarily mean that everyone and everything has to have a ""psycho background"". The occasional reflections in the police car lights are speaking for a normal screen reflection of the game character. Just as the flackering lights, in which you can even see the head slightely moving sometimes.   I think it is rather an element that opens the game towards another dimension. The game character doesn't play a role at first but throughout the game, it becomes obvious that the player is somehow a part of it, so the reflections occur. That was damn scary at first, but once I realised that the game character is somewhere in the story, I caught myself checking out the reflection whenever it occured later, trying to spot any differences that might contribute to the story. Didn't succeed. But kudos to the developer to create a great feeling of ""I belong to this, somehow"" with such simple measures."
HerStoryGame,3baffa,Rakkai,2,Sat Jun 27 13:33:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, very immersive"
HerStoryGame,3baffa,hTyUK,3,Sat Jun 27 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"The only thing that bothers me about the reflections are the occasional siren lights which aren't very immersive, to say the least. Doesn't the game take place in a basement archive?"
HerStoryGame,3baffa,MrTeaBelly,6,Sat Jun 27 15:23:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe it has a window?, it is in a police station, so it's not that farfetched that police cars come and go"
HerStoryGame,3baffa,voodoorayray,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:41:44 2015 UTC,"I thought the sirens were an audio cue when you discover something important. Bit like when you find the story going in a different direction, the music changes."

HerStoryGame,3baffa,Tickleson,3,Mon Jun 29 18:47:16 2015 UTC,It scared me so bad that I had to turn off the glare for the rest of the game. I was worried this game was like one of those websites when you stare at something really long and then a face pops up and screams at you lol.

Seeing the interviews out of order makes it vastly more interesting.

HerStoryGame,3b026j,hobbbz,10,Wed Jun 24 21:53:26 2015 UTC,I haven't actually figured out if Spoiler  The stories are so detailed and the tattoo doesn't help.
HerStoryGame,3b026j,cckerberos,3,Wed Jun 24 21:55:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same person seems a lot more plausible but that tattoo seems to pretty definitively rule that out..."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,HammerSandwich,9,Thu Jun 25 09:02:56 2015 UTC,"The bruise makes it more likely they are different people. Search BRUISE and watch the 2nd clip. Hannah/Hannah has a nasty bruise on her left cheek. Then search METABOLISM and watch the only clip. Hannah/Eve has no bruise, says it cleared up because of fast metabolism (unlikely...) and then - most tellingly, she touches the wrong cheek. Because she sees Hannah as her reflection, so when she looks at Hannah's bruised cheek, she feels it on the other side of her face."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Carighan,5,Thu Jun 25 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"The wrong cheek is the biggest giveaway, IMO. I just recently watched the Thing 2011 movie, so that part immediately stuck out to me."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,empathogen75,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:49:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you don't actually see the bruise on the wrong side of the face do you?"
HerStoryGame,3b026j,HammerSandwich,3,Sat Jun 27 17:07:49 2015 UTC,"In fact, you see no bruise at all. Which, given the way it appears only 2 days earlier, seems it is pretty unlikely to have vanished completely. Even if (as she claims) she ""has a fast metabolism""."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Sean_May,5,Sun Jun 28 14:57:13 2015 UTC,"To go with the same person theory, isn't it possible that the tattoo could have been temporary? It only shows up one time, in the 7/1 interview, and if Hannah/Eve was purposely trying to deceive the detectives into thinking she was two people, that would be a good way to do it, to prominently show a tattoo where there wasn't one.  I'm thinking the split personalities thing is very possible, especially considering Eve's final few statements in the 7/3 interview about not being able to arrest someone who doesn't exist."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,StoryTellerBob,3,Thu Jun 25 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"I think ""someone who doesn't exist"" just refers to the fact that she does not exist on paper. Florence probably reported Eve as still born, so there would be no birth certificate, no social security number, no real name or evidence of her existing at all."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Sean_May,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:19:03 2015 UTC,Exactly...and it would be very difficult to arrest or prosecute someone who had lived under those circumstances...especially when there's someone with the exact same DNA to pin the crime on.
HerStoryGame,3b026j,pedwards3x,3,Sat Jun 27 01:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think when she talks about someone who doesn't exist there is still solid evidence for two people. I think ""eve"" just doesn't legally exist which would make sense if she was declared dead at birth and Florence took her away."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,abardam,2,Thu Jun 25 21:04:14 2015 UTC,Hmm. What evidence would suggest they are the same person? I'm not in too deep yet but everything seems to imply two different people.
HerStoryGame,3b026j,abardam,3,Thu Jun 25 01:19:08 2015 UTC,"No strict evidence but the scene where eve takes a lie detector test says her name is Hannah. All the switching places stuff, secret sister, etc. seemed like mental illness off the bat."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,DontCallMeALeeHead,5,Thu Jun 25 02:07:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I seem to recall a clip where she talks about if the lie detector actually works, and it appears that it went off when she was asked her name, so she said, ""Ah, then it's accurate."" Not sure why she'd be so candid about it though!"
HerStoryGame,3b026j,HammerSandwich,13,Thu Jun 25 02:25:43 2015 UTC,My name? That was the only question I failed.  (laughs) Your lie detector works.
HerStoryGame,3b026j,moriarty70,6,Thu Jun 25 02:29:25 2015 UTC,"The weird thing is about the death of the parents from mushrooms. Search POISON, FORENSIC, and DEATH CAP and see the conflicting stories - one Hannah/Eve says they died in summer and weren't found for days as she ""wasn't there"". And that the scene was horrendous.   Other Hannah/Eve says she was living in the attic at the time. How could she live through that smell?! :D  Final weird one is the later interview, Hannah/Eve talks about Dad taking ""us"" to pick mushrooms. Are we to understand the parents found out about the twins at some stage and they all lived together? My understanding up until then is that only Hannah/Eve ever knew they both existed (After Florence died/was probably killed)."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Carighan,9,Thu Jun 25 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"I think the us part was meant that they were taking turns by that point in their lives. I've found enough to hint that by that point, she's admitting everything and not keeping up the show for the cops."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Sparksman91,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's what I figured out, too. She's admitting they're different, but you also know by then that they kept pretending to be the same person before, in regards to parents, BFs, everything."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Sean_May,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:52:56 2015 UTC,I agree
HerStoryGame,3b026j,HammerSandwich,7,Sat Jun 27 08:51:58 2015 UTC,"Are we to understand the parents found out about the twins at some stage and they all lived together   I don't think the parents ever knew about both Hannah and Eve...during the 7/3 interview Eve talks about herself living in the attic and getting caught by their mom when Hannah was getting ready for school. I think Eve lived in the attic for a long time, even after Hannah moved out. As to how she could stand the smell of her dead parents for days during a heat wave and not even make a mention of it being bad, I don't know."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Sean_May,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:22:54 2015 UTC,"That's the puzzle. What you say is how it's implied. But surely Eve only ever managed to secretly live there, because the parents saw her and thought she was Hannah? So once Hannah moved out, did she stay on, and pretended to her parents she was Hannah? Probably not, because they knew Hannah was with Simon, expecting a baby. So she lived there undetected? Even less likely to me..."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Carighan,2,Thu Jun 25 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"If we're going with Hannah and Eve as different people, which I'm not entirely convinced of still, I think that the parents never knew about Eve. After years of hiding up in the attic, Eve would probably been really good at sneaking around and avoiding detection."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,cyberham,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"This is what I understood, too. She just continued to hide in the attic."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Elaine_Benes_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"does seem unlikely that eve could live completely undetected in a house for years, which is why i think she poisoned the parents. could be because they found out, but i feel like if they did find out they would report that to the police or something immediately. more likely she just killed them so she could live in the house, maybe she was tired of sneaking around."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,StoryTellerBob,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"But Hannah also talks about how when she was young, she would blame ""my friend Eve"" for things when she got in trouble. So it sounds from that like her parents could have known she had an imaginary friend. I've been wondering if that's why she killed them--she couldn't have their knowledge of her childhood relationship with her friend who was never really there be revealed to Simon."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Sean_May,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"I think by ""us"" she just meant that it happened multiple times, so sometimes they would (unknowingly) bring Hannah and other times they would bring Eve."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,HammerSandwich,5,Fri Jun 26 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"Can we talk about the second knock code, the one from the 7/3 interview? I got ""B-Y-D-H-A-N-N-A-H"", which could easily be an error on Eve's part if she was trying to say ""Bye Hannah.""  Also, is the truest test of whether we're seeing Hannah or Eve determined by how they take their coffee/tea?  And finally, has anyone been able to find the 'missing' volume?"
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Sean_May,5,Thu Jun 25 18:18:55 2015 UTC,"I'd take all of the contradictions and errors as being deliberate. If there was a mistake in production, they'd have re-filmed it.  So instead, we should assume it's a deliberate error. In one of the later clips, Hannah/Eve talks about how each was better at different things: driving, flirting, etc. We can assume that One is better at tap code, too. Which might hint at the two tap code clips being done by different people."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,Carighan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:39:29 2015 UTC,"Right, the first tap code was done by Hannah, the second one by Eve. But the strange thing is that Eve made the error, when it seemed like Eve was the one that had to be more secretive.  Also I don't think it was a technical production error, I think there's definitely something to it. Maybe there is a fifth tap in that sequence that would change the D to an E that I missed, but I looked at it with an audio analyzer and I didn't see more than 4 taps in that sequence."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,GlutenFreeBullshit,3,Thu Jun 25 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"It's actually B-Y-E-H-A-N-N-A-N, and I suspect it's a typo. Could be the actresses mistake never got caught (unlike the other sequence, this one is pretty difficult to listen to), or could be that the wanted to highlight how Eve isn't as good with this as Hannah is."
HerStoryGame,3b026j,nluqo,2,Fri Jun 26 22:54:19 2015 UTC,They seem to take coffee/tea differently. There are 4 combinations of milk/black and sugar/nosugar in the coffee clips and there is the tea clips so I really don't think it would help but I could be wrong.
