letsgofish,3e2gdq,safariari,8,Tue Jul 21 13:27:58 2015 UTC,It's a new low.  This means our prospects are an issue possibly?  /u/Navi401 can we blame the prospects or is it coaching?
letsgofish,3e2gdq,Navi401,7,Tue Jul 21 13:39:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah we suck. Loria sold Heaney, Disco, Flynn and everyone else for this season and we're on pace for the #2 pick next year. In the upper minors all we have left are bullpen pitchers. Last years draft class has a lot of potential but is super raw and is still in the lower minors.

We've pretty much depleted our minor league system in order to make a run this season. Getting a guy like Dee cost us our best pitching prospect in Heaney (currently 4-0 with a 1.57 ERA for LAA), for example.   We have never been willing to shell out big money on our top draft picks, thus we're stuck with selecting lower tier guys that are only looking for scale -- i.e our current sidebar picture."

On top of this draft class fucking sucking, Loria also skimped out on shelling out for the International prospects too. Last year we signed 8 players for at least $100k, two even eclipsed $500k. That was great compared to our past activity on the international market but it's nothing compared to what the Red Sox, Yankees, Rays, spent last year or what the Dodgers, Giants, Rangers, Cubs spent this year or what the Braves and Phillies will spend next year. All those team completely busted their alloted bonus pool. This year, we've only singed like 9 players , total! And only one is for decent money."

letsgofish,3e032x,jigokusabre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:40 2015 UTC,"I really want us to trade away Hand, not for the fact for how bad he is, but because I truly believe that with the right club and management, he can be developed into a decent pitcher. Hell, he is only 25. He has so much time for development, but the Marlins want to have him sit in a bullpen and have him pitch maybe once a week. When he is on though (which seems to be rare), he can be very nasty. Again, not enough and probably attributable to his constant lack of playing time. Fuck this team."

Looking at the pattern at how it's going with the 3-1 series win against the Reds, I just thought... maybe, maybe we might lose this series, even if its the Phillies. I wasn't expecting that we'd get swept though.  They are just going to put us on the roller coaster again by winning a series against the Diamondbacks, then get swept by the Tigers and then sweeping the Nationals or something like that.

letsgofish,3du62r,rejz342,4,Sun Jul 19 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"I'll be more than happy too.  Man on first base. Ground ball to Solano at second. Solano is basically in the base path, can easily tag the runner for an out. The runner on first basically stops to stall Solano. This then throws Solano into a whirl-wind of confusion and instead of tagging out the lead runner he throws the ball to first (which was also a horrible throw, pulled Casey off the bag) and the player advances to second. The player who got to second base ended up being the lead run.  TL;DR - Solano is a fucking scrub who has no business playing in the Majors."
letsgofish,3du62r,stupidsexyrumham,4,Sun Jul 19 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"The best part is that the runner was Francoeur, who got so motivated by this terrible showing of baseball that he went on to hit a walk-off home run.  Truly a terrible play. Solano could have tagged Francoeur out, as you said. He could have flipped the ball to Hech, who was covering the base. He could have run it to the base himself. Instead, he decided to fucking throw the ball around Francoeur to first base, which was almost a throwing error.  One of the Marlins announcers commented on the fact that Jennings basically wasted Solano by putting him in at second base but having Dietrich pinch-hit for him before he got an at-bat. I disagree; it seemed like the right move to make after witnessing this spectacular collapse of baseball fundamentals.  TL;DR - I'm mad bro"

letsgofish,3dws7n,JoshuaKevinPerry,9,Mon Jul 20 04:33:10 2015 UTC,Getting the largest contract in history isn't really a reduction in salary potential
letsgofish,3dws7n,cologol18,5,Mon Jul 20 04:41:59 2015 UTC,"He took immense drops in the first 6 years aka his prime. It's 6 years 107M.  The propaganda was ""a low salary lets us compete for free agents to make the team better."" In reality, Loria gets to rake in profits till he's dead."
letsgofish,3dws7n,jigokusabre,5,Mon Jul 20 04:50:12 2015 UTC,Baseball contracts are 100% guaranteed. He's getting the full amount. What does it matter to Stanton how black-loaded it is?
letsgofish,3dws7n,jigokusabre,2,Mon Jul 20 06:42:42 2015 UTC,The opt-out makes me question the contract logic.
letsgofish,3dws7n,Fus_Joe_Dah,3,Mon Jul 20 07:38:07 2015 UTC,"It's not too different than the Alex Rodriguez opt out from his 2002 deal with the Rangers. If Stanton thinks he do better on the free agent market than 8 years / $269 mm, then he has that option. $25 mm / year seems like a ton of money now, but who knows where the free agent market will be in 2020."
letsgofish,3dws7n,ThePaulitician,4,Mon Jul 20 13:24:25 2015 UTC,"To be completely fair, he took less money in his first 6 years of the contract so the front office can sign a few players to fill out the lineup around him. A combination of numerous injuries, poor bullpen pitching, and players not playing to their expectations when healthy (besides Dee, and silently Prado) has led to this disappointing year. Morse hasn't performed like he did in SF, Yelich has been hurt and hasn't played like he did last year at all, Ozuna just hasn't hit the ball at all and had to be sent down to AAA for it. At one point in our season we had 4 of our 5 best pitchers on the DL at the exact same time in Fernandez, Alvarez, Cosart, and Latos. Latos has finally returned to the pitcher we expected him to be when we signed him, and of course Fernandez has been what we expected since his return. Cosart hasn't been the same since his issue with vertigo and Alvarez has yet to return from his injury. He is 0-4 with a 6.45 ERA (definitely not what we expected from our opening day starter). Our bullpen has been atrocious and have blown 13 out of 30 save opportunities. The reality is if our bullpen can close out those games and get those W's we'd be much more competitive in the division despite all the injuries. It has been a very disappointing year that much is certain, but not even Stanton could have foreseen these many injuries and setbacks, and expectations this year were through the roof. Not trying to make excuses for this team's poor play this year, just thought I'd try to see it from the other perspective as well."
letsgofish,3dws7n,rejz342,3,Mon Jul 20 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"Stanton is secretly one of those players who wants to lift up a city from its misery. However, Big G is a realist. He understands that our poor ownership in Jeffrey Loria prevents the team from flowing into a dynasty. I mean, can we all please take a moment to remember the 2012 trade?? It was probably one of the worst deals in history! I think Stanton is also one to not care about the record. He plays in the moment. When he's at the plate, he knows he can change the course of the game. However, when he is not, he understands that he has no control."
letsgofish,3dws7n,DoctorTheWho,6,Mon Jul 20 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"People who say the 2012 trade was the worst are morons. We got Hech, Alvarez, Nicolino, Disco, and Marisnick. We traded 2 of those guys for, what I believe to be, significant additions to our roster (Cosart and Latos) and Hech and Alvarez (when healthy) are core players. Stop the bullshit circle jerk and actually find out what you're talking about."

letsgofish,3dnugc,nekromantique,3,Sat Jul 18 01:24:20 2015 UTC,The reasoning the broadcast gave was they felt it would be smarter to let Dietrich get a chance to come up and hit to get runs and rely on our rested bullpen. Just DJ being DJ.

letsgofish,3devhd,Supersace56,4,Wed Jul 15 18:53:08 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. Chris Reed is kind of an oddball in the Dodgers organization. They've basically been super-lenient with him. He was a reliever all through college, and when he got drafted he expressed an interest in starting. The Dodgers were like ""Sure, let's see what happens,"" which he had little success, they just converted him back this year. I haven't looked at his numbers so far this year, BUT he was way down at like High A or AA at the start of the season.   Fun fact, he's also a member of the British national baseball team, as he was born there, but he grew up in the States and learned baseball here."

letsgofish,3devhd,eddy5791,5,Thu Jul 16 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"God, I hate what a cynic I've become with Marlins trades. I'm trying to find a reason to not like this trade and figure why we lost it.   Dayton was actually doing very well in AAA. Has always been a 9+ K/9 guy with sub-3 BB/9. Lefty RP, which is what we traded for. Dayton never had the pedigree Reed does, so I'm assuming Marlins just banking on that.   I'm interested in how Reed ends up shaking out as a reliever, as that always adds some mph to the fastball.   Low-key trade, so we'll see how it looks a year from now."
letsgofish,3devhd,eddy5791,3,Wed Jul 15 22:26:21 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how I feel about this as well. He was a top-10 prospect in the Dodgers organization, but his stats don't show it plus MLBTR is reporting that he has been issuing more walks than Ks compared to Dayton while holding a 5.97 ERA while Dayton is holding a steady mid-2 ERA as a reliever.   I personally can't see something good coming out of this, but if I were to be wrong about that, by god I would be surprised even more.  I'm still confused about why we would trade for Reed, but what I said sums up my thoughts unless someone can shead some light on the situation."
letsgofish,3devhd,iharland,3,Wed Jul 15 22:37:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Seeing Dayton's numbers makes me wonder why we didn't bring him up before, especially early on when we were having bullpen struggles."
letsgofish,3devhd,camboss,2,Wed Jul 15 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"I like this trade on the surface, but with the Dodgers being the good trading FO, it worries me a little that they may have seen something we don't.  Only time will tell though."
letsgofish,3dcjwy,faltasenor87,4,Wed Jul 15 05:14:40 2015 UTC,"I guessed Conine, Hanley, Miggy and Stanton.   Disagree with Sheffield. He was with the Marlins 4+ years, and only one of those (1996) was stellar. I get the Mike Lowell love, but I probably sub him out for Hanley. Lowell was consistent, but Hanley was just so much better.  EDIT: Also, how crazy is it that a 25 year old is a shoo-in for a face of a franchise?"
letsgofish,3dcjwy,eddy5791,5,Wed Jul 15 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"Gary Sheffield was the first star of the Florida Marlins, and the face of the franchise for the first 5 years. It's no surprise that he made it the cut."
letsgofish,3dcjwy,jigokusabre,4,Wed Jul 15 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"I wasn't into baseball back then, so I have no idea how we was portrayed with the club. Influence is a fair factor to consider (kind of why Conine made it), so perhaps in the eyes of the fans, he was bigger in his time in Miami than Miggy or Hanley.   I started following the team in 2003, so my bias is obvious."
letsgofish,3dcjwy,eddy5791,5,Wed Jul 15 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"I emulated his batting stance at the time. My coaches hated it. They'd ask me to stop, I wouldn't.   I also never got a hit"

letsgofish,3dcjwy,Lanza21,4,Mon Jul 20 03:48:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely disagree with Conine and sheff over Hanley and Cabrera. Their numbers with the fish alone put them above every other hitter in team history not named Giancarlo. And my fourth is a toss up of just personal preference between d-train, Lowell, and Castillo.   Sigh.. The things I care about when the season is already over at the break."
letsgofish,3dcjwy,turdninja,4,Wed Jul 15 05:17:41 2015 UTC,"Niner is Mr. Marlin he had to be in the four, especially over someone like Hanley who had a tumultuous career with the Fish and while I do love Miggy he is recognized more as a Tiger than a Marlin unfortunately and Sheff was a truly great player in his time."
letsgofish,3dcjwy,Pimpinpinguino,2,Wed Jul 15 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"I think people forget how good Hanley was because he was an ass. Rookie of the year.

Aside from the fact that they ended up in last place and Ozzie Guillen made those comments about Castro, the fire sale to the Blue Jays was the last straw for many fans. As much as I love this team, it's run by assholes. Things aren't gonna change much until one day this team is sold. Think about it, Dan Jennings was placed as manager earlier this year. He was a good GM, but that's not the same as clubhouse presence. It's not gonna be long until he gets booted and we'll have lost a GM too. Injuries have fucked us over this year, but the front office is among the worst in sports, they're just in it for the money. I still love this team because of guys like Jose Fernandez, Giancarlo Stanton and many others who give their best for this city, but it doesn't change the fact that many have been felt duped by Loria after paying tax money for Marlins Park and still be away from playoff contention 3 years later."
letsgofish,3d3lzv,cologol18,3,Mon Jul 13 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"Hey.  I appeared in a lot of gamethreads early on in the season. Haven't been in one in a few weeks now, but I still lurk.  Baseball always has been and always will be my 2nd favorite sport, and it's just hard to get excited about a bad team. I still look at box scores and watch the occasional game (mostly Fernandez starts these days), but why would I have much interest in watching a team without Gordon or Stanton? So the team can get a top draft pick and reach for another prospect like they did with Naylor?"

Combination of things like summer vacation, the team sucking balls, our best players getting injured, etc., but I've still been watching all the games just like I have been for years.

I feel like that is everyone's mentality but we dont realize that if everyone would just comment a few times in the pre-game/early game that would build discussions that would make more people want to join the comversation.

letsgofish,3d3lzv,HurricaneStiz,5,Mon Jul 13 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"Especially in Miami.   We're not a sports city, we're an ""event"" city. When something catches our attention, we dive in 100%. Then we have the sports fan who stay committed through thick and thin. One thing about Miami is that we won't ever have an empty stadium unless the team forces that issue. Like Loria being Loria."

I was about 9 or 10 @ the time and I've watched at least 20% of the games every year barring a few years where I followed the team more from online articles or sports talk radio, etc.   I just found Reddit last year and I am following all my fav. sports teams Reddits (Heat/Dolphins/Marlins) but after a certain point there's really nothing to say. Watching the Marlins is still fun right now (it wasn't last year, at all) but really I feel we are just circling the wagon until next year.

letsgofish,3cykl2,jigokusabre,5,Sat Jul 11 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"Bochy is not required to pick a Marlin (Stanton was replaced by Bryce Harper in 2012). Wong is the most logical choice to replace Gordon.   If they did choose a SS instead, odds are it will be Tulowitzski, whom Bochy thought enough to to include in the final All-Star vote.   EDIT: Confirmed. Tulo replaces Gordon on the All-Star roster."
letsgofish,3cykl2,panthers21546,6,Sat Jul 11 23:20:24 2015 UTC,Love Adeiny but I'd say Wong or Tulo are more deserving.

Honestly, Stanton's injury sucked, but Gordon was avoidable if he didn't slide headfirst into the bag. You are just days away from the game and if you want to be in there, you shouldn't be taking any risks. Furthermore, your team was leading.  All in all, this one falls onto Gordon for sure. We just have to suck it up."
letsgofish,3cykl2,jigokusabre,3,Sun Jul 12 00:52:34 2015 UTC,Meh. Dee was efforting a single in a close game. Sometimes shit happens.
letsgofish,3cykl2,Harrason,3,Sun Jul 12 03:24:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose nobody would've expected an 8 run inning at that point of time, but I don't think it was that close. I still think sliding headfirst into that bag, especially with Gordon's kind of speed is just asking for trouble, and he might not even need to slide.  But yeah, I am just ready to forget about the whole part of having 2 of us getting selected for the ASG. I think it would be easier to pretend that they've never been selected as part of the ASG roster in the first place."
letsgofish,3cykl2,jigokusabre,2,Sun Jul 12 03:34:12 2015 UTC,"The score was 5-3 when Dee made that play. I wasn't in the GDT, but I can't imagine there was much of a ""this game is in the bag"" sentiment."

letsgofish,3cxf97,SoddenEye,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:31:13 2015 UTC,Probably the latter :(

letsgofish,3cxf97,jigokusabre,3,Sat Jul 11 20:02:51 2015 UTC,who doesn't like Hits McGehee...
letsgofish,3cxf97,beefat99,3,Sat Jul 11 20:04:56 2015 UTC,He's been Shits McGehee over the last year or so.

letsgofish,3cxf97,Navi401,3,Sat Jul 11 18:30:35 2015 UTC,What about Strikeouts McGehee.
letsgofish,3cvd4k,karabekian77,8,Sat Jul 11 02:15:56 2015 UTC,This is the most blueball inducing headline ever. I thought we were getting rid of Loria...

letsgofish,3cvd4k,DoctorTheWho,3,Sat Jul 11 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"We can still try to sign him after the season and get something for him now. I wouldn't really want to sign him though, he's hurt too often and was awful this season before regaining his velocity. Any minor injury could sap him of that velocity again and make him the guy he was for the first few months of the year."
letsgofish,3cvd4k,DoctorTheWho,2,Sat Jul 11 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"That is true. Though I don't think the team is that far off from contending next season. If Bour is a 20+ HR bat with a decent average, then we really only need a good CF and another bullpen piece  I wish we could just have a full season with a healthy Yelich, Stanton, Prado and Jose, to see what happens."
letsgofish,3cvd4k,BroomPerson21,-3,Sat Jul 11 16:30:02 2015 UTC,dump Latos fat ass. Fuck him

letsgofish,3cu4n7,jigokusabre,2,Sat Jul 11 00:59:09 2015 UTC,Hmmm Acura promoting their vtech with some clever verbage and editing. It seems to be able making your car go faster with that commercial. However the verbiage says optimize at any speed. Vtech opens and closes a valve to allow the horsepower to increase at the higher rpms so you don't waste gas at lower rpms. Clever ad.
letsgofish,3cu4n7,Design_with_Whiskey,3,Sat Jul 11 00:51:44 2015 UTC,"Looking at Leake, I have to wonder... is the mohawk the defining look of baseball in the 2010s? Like the Moustache was in the 70s?"
letsgofish,3cu4n7,jigokusabre,2,Sat Jul 11 00:43:58 2015 UTC,It's a defining look for sports in general I think. Look at ANY soccer team in Europe. Mohawks everywhere.
letsgofish,3cu4n7,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Sat Jul 11 00:46:04 2015 UTC,Why is Hech still in the goddamned 3-hole?!!!
letsgofish,3cu4n7,Supersace56,3,Sat Jul 11 00:42:47 2015 UTC,Because it's not like the Marlins have anyone else to put there. Except Yelich. Except DD. Except Bour. Except Morse.

letsgofish,3cu4n7,jigokusabre,3,Fri Jul 10 23:10:50 2015 UTC,The bad news is that Baker's on the DL and McGehee has officially joined the Marlins.   The good news is that he's not in the lineup tonight (per rotowire).   The more bad news is that Valdespin will be playing RF.

letsgofish,3cprlv,meyer_33_09,2,Fri Jul 10 02:13:45 2015 UTC,We'll give them Mathis?
letsgofish,3cprlv,beefat99,2,Thu Jul 9 23:56:31 2015 UTC,"Probably none that aren't free agents at the end of the season.

They have a lot of developmental pitchers in their farm but they could still take the risk on Matt Latos as he would instantly be one of their best options on a contract I think they would be willing to take on. If they are only shooting for playoffs this year as a reward for A.J. Pollock and Paul Goldschmidt they could buy back one of their franchise heroes in Dan Haren to let him finish his career as a Diamondback. I also do not see them being willing to take back Martin Prado after dealing him to the Marlins at the beginning of the year.  Trade Thoughts:  This may be more than they could get or it could be undershooting what they could land in a deal with Arizona. It all comes down to the teams scouting report. I doubt you will see the Diamondbacks make a move that includes any of Archie Bradley, Braden Shipley, Aaron Blair, or Yoan Lopez in all reality they have a very bright future if those names pan out half as well as they could potentially.  Potential Trade 1:  Miami Marlins Send: Matt Latos  Arizona Diamondbacks Send: Brandon Drury and Cody Reed  Brandon Drury – Probably my favorite hitter in their system. I am actually higher on him than I think most scouts are. With Jake Lamb ahead of him at 3B I could see the Diamonbacks willing to part with a prospect that I profile to be similar to what you are seeing Logan Forsythe currently over in Tampa Bay.   Cody Reed - With the abundance of arms I think they may be willing to part with Cody Reed. As a 19 year old Cody Reed is flashing a ton of upside. He was the organizations second round pick in 2014.   Potential Trade 2:  Miami Marlins Send: Dan Haren and J.T. Riddle  Arizona Diamondbacks Send: Peter O’Brien and Mitch Haniger  Peter O’Brien - A big powerful offensively ready catcher would make an immediate splash in the Marlins outfield where he is currently playing in the minors. The Diamondbacks had him switch positions so they can bring him up quicker much as you saw from Kyle Schwarber in Chicago. I think the Marlins could either use him immediately or let him finish developing as a catcher. Not that J.T. Realmuto is bad, nor the future, but they could use a solid backup catcher that can be used as OF if his bat develops into what it could.   Mitch Haniger – A player who was supposed to be a lot better than he is. He is still developing but a lot of scouts thought he would be in the bigs already. Likely won’t amount to much but I think he still has value and in my opinion still worth buying."
letsgofish,3co6bt,JoshuaSP,3,Thu Jul 9 14:55:12 2015 UTC,I also do not see them being willing to take back Martin Prado after dealing him to the Marlins at the beginning of the year.   The D'Backs dealt Prado to the Yankees at the deadline last year. The Yankees dealt Prado to the Marlins this offseason.
letsgofish,3co6bt,jigokusabre,3,Thu Jul 9 18:31:49 2015 UTC,Ohhhh you are so right.
letsgofish,3co6bt,JoshuaSP,2,Thu Jul 9 18:34:53 2015 UTC,Would the acquisition of Brandon Drury bring him directly to Miami or would he be sent to the minors until Prado is gone?
letsgofish,3co6bt,JoshuaSP,3,Thu Jul 9 17:17:22 2015 UTC,I would imagine they would send him to the minors. He is a big league ready bat but they have him playing 2B at the moment. They likely would send him to triple-a to either evaluate him further at 3B or simply let him transition back before hitting the bigs. He has the range to cover it but I wouldn't say he is Nolan Arenado over there. Prado is likely the better 3B defensively.

I had high hopes for their staff coming into this year before injuries and early call ups ruined a lot of the momentum they hoped they were tapping into. The call up of Aaron Sanchez and Daniel Norris both seem to have been a step in the wrong direction for their overall development in my minds.  Trade Thoughts:  I think the Blue Jays will take pitching any way they can take it. If Matt Latos was to string together a few quality starts in a row I think the Blue Jays would be quick to buy into him. They are a pitcher or two away from winning the World Series. The last thing they need however is another bat. If they were to get enough help I think you could see them moving the developing stud Jeff Hoffmann  Potential Trade:  Miami Marlins Send: Dan Haren and Matt Latos   Toronto Blue Jays Send: Jeff Hoffmann, Anthony Alford, and Rowdy Tellez  Jeff Hoffmann – Likely my favorite arm in the minor leagues Jeff Hoffmann was almost a unanimous first overall pick in last year’s draft before suffering an arm injury that ended in a Tommy John Surgery. Now back into recovery Hoffmann seems to be pitching well. It would take the right deal for the Blue Jays to move him but I think they should in a deal that gives them so much fire power.  Anthony Alford – A lesser touted bat that is making some strides in the minors this year. He is still young and has spent a lot of time outside of baseball when he went to USM to play football. Very raw and could develop into a decent prospect.  Rowdy Tellez – His large frame limits his base running substantially. He is an above average bat with the tool set of the current Billy Butler. Limited to first base but likely will never see the majors unless his bat develops more power, which it could."
letsgofish,3co6bt,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,2,Thu Jul 9 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"That package gets us Cueto+Chapman. Or at least extremely close.  Dan Haren has the 3rd highest FB% in the majors, that isn't going to work in the homer dome.   Latos gives us yet another fringe-average starter. Literally no improvement over anyone in our rotation."
letsgofish,3co6bt,JoshuaSP,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:02:25 2015 UTC,I agree it may be an overpayment but you really only have two true pitchers in RA and Mark. Hutchinson is going to need to really get his road game figured out. Dan Haren and Latos in my opinion are just as good as RA and Mark. But I agree that you likely could get a pitcher like Cueto if you involved Hoffmann but I doubt Toronto would offer as much as Boston or LAD to get a deal done. I don't think yal are going to get an ace unfortunately.
letsgofish,3co6bt,BettyWhiteOnSteroids,0,Sun Jul 12 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"Let me say it again, a fly ball pitcher in the Rogers Centre is a really really bad idea. Even then, Haren and Laros are worth very very little.  You're not going to get an elite prospect for either of them."
letsgofish,3co6bt,JoshuaSP,3,Sun Jul 12 18:51:53 2015 UTC,"I wanted to take a stab at this. My response will be a lot longer than normal so I will just make them separate comments.   Detroit Tigers    Team ERA Rank Team Strike Outs Rank Innings Pitched Rank    4.24 26 583 26 758 18    Interests:    Player Name Fits Team Need    Dan Haren Yes   Matt Latos No   Martin Prado No    Notes: The Tigers need to find another reliable pitcher outside of David Price and Anibal Sanchez if they want to make it deep into the playoffs. Due to the nature of their budget I wouldn’t imagine that they would be willing to take on Matt Latos and his salary despite any upside he may have. Dan Haren seems to be a great fit for their organizational needs and what they would be willing to pay.   Trade Thoughts:  The Tigers do not have much of a farm system and outside of the likes of Steven Moya they don’t have any option that is actually that likely to perform at an MLB level. It would take a couple of prospects who had a shot at contributing to be worth trading with the Tigers.  Potential Trade:  Miami Marlins Send: Dan Haren  Detroit Tigers Send: Dixon Machado, Wynton Bernard, Spencer Turnbull  Dixon Machado- I like Dixon Machado to be able to be a utility player that comes off the bench but his upside seems limited.   Wynton Bernard- He won the Midwest League MVP in 2014 and is off to a solid season again this year who boasts above average speed and has great gap power.   Spencer Turnbull – Has a solid fastball and slider. Currently posting an ERA around 3 in 67 innings of work while striking out 57. He is likely going to be a long relief pitcher but could turn into a spot starter to fill in the end of a rotation."

I don’t like any of their pitchers outside of Garrett Richards and do not think they can win with the rotation they currently have. They do not have much of a farm to rely on moving forward now that they have promoted a once Marlin, Andrew Heaney. I think that they match up very well in trade dealings with the Marlins.  Trade Thoughts:  I am not sure any prospect is off limits in a potential deal with the Angels. They have proven they will move anything to get a shot at the World Series and I doubt this year is much different. I think they could use a long term arm like Latos as well as a short burst in Dan Haren. They have David Freese manning third while Johnny Giavotella at second and Martin Prado would be an instant improvement to either.   Potential Trade 1:  Miami Marlins Send: Dan Haren  Los Angeles Angels Send: Sean Newcomb and Kaleb Cowart   Sean Newcomb – A great arm with a lot of upside who is likely to be the third or fourth option. He has the makings of a number two starter at best from the little film I have seen. He is now the best prospect in the farm and likely will be involved in any deal they make for an arm or bat as they have one of the worst farm systems in the major leagues.   Kaleb Cowart – Cowart used to be the best prospect the Angels had until he had an abysmal year last year. He still shows some developmental room but overall Cowart will develop into a positional stop gap and unlikely to be a true MLB level player.   Potential Trade 2:  Miami Marlins Send: Matt Latos  Los Angeles Angels Send: Sean Newcomb, Hunter Green, Eric Stamets  Hunter Green – A high upside pitcher taken in the second round last year. He has been out with a back injury and could develop into a very well rounded pitcher. Had the makings of a number two or three option before the injury.   Eric Stamets – A glove first player. Has limited upside with his bat but overall he could make a solid utility man whose glove could make an instant impact on the field.   Potential Trade 3:  Miami Marlins Send: Martin Prado  Los Angeles Angels Send: Sean Newcomb, Kyle Kubitza  Kyle Kubitza – An overall strong player whose only struggle seems to be his consistency with his swing. He is showing improvements as a hitter and has always boasted a strong understanding of the strike zone. He has a good feel for the ball and could become an everyday player with more development."

There seems to be a lot less hype around them than I believe they deserve. If they could get someone to come in and go deep into the game to allow their phenomenal pin to finish the game I think they could increase their win total, compared to what it would be, by at least five when it’s all said and done. This is the role they were hoping C.C. Sabathia would fill.   Trade Thoughts:  The Yankees might surprise you and want to buy Matt Latos but overall I doubt they would. They generally buy pitchers who are currently showing immense upside or can instantly contribute. I think with their current farm system and organizational needs Dan Haren is the only option that makes sense. You will not see them move Jorge Mateo, Aaron Judge, or Robert Refsnyder and by a trade happens Luis Severino likely will be in the bigs.  Potential Trade:  Miami Marlins Send – Dan Haren  New York Yankees Send – Mason Williams and Juan De Leon  Mason Williams- A once highly touted prospect, Mason Williams is now starting to turn the corner again. He continues to show what he could become but still manages to disappoint shortly after. Still a bit of a long shot but Mason Williams does have the makings of and everyday outfielder if he can right his wrongs and turn back on course.   Juan De Leon – A pure developmental player the seventeen year old was my favorite player coming out of the international market during the 2015-2015 signings. He has the makings to be a star if all the intangibles align well when he transitions state side."
letsgofish,3co6bt,jigokusabre,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"They generally buy pitchers who are currently showing immense upside or can instantly contribute.   I would think that this would lead them more in Latos' direction than Haren's. Between his increased velocity, higher BABIP, and and his superior FIP/xFIP/SIERA, Latos looks to have more of an upside than Haren. Besides, Haren gives up many more HRs, which would not play well in Yankee Stadium (or Rogers Centre or Fenway for that matter)."
letsgofish,3co6bt,JoshuaSP,2,Thu Jul 9 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Sure he has more upside, I don't think anyone would argue against that but Latos isn't exactly the upside they are attributed to buying. Looking at the pitchers they tend to trade for, Latos just doesn't have that same upside. Heck even Eovaldi has more ""upside"" than Latos, even though that likely won't come into fruition.   Haren is a one year option to get them to where they need to go instead of investing a lot of money into a option that likely won't pan out enough to match the salary. Its not to say that Latos isn't the better options its just that he doesn't meet the criteria for the type of pitcher I think the Yankees would want to invest long term money into. Haren on the other hand comes in and contributes right away while retiring likely in the offseason."

With Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano making a splash they rightly should. There pitching is abysmal though and though they have a few good arms in their system none profile to be large difference makers.  Trade Thoughts:  Matt Latos seems to be perfect for an organizational need. He has the makings of a true ace and is having control issues. The Twins could really use someone that could instantly come in and be one of their best options, as crazy as that sounds. I don’t think his salary is much concern for the Twins if they could get an arm they can keep around for a while and still have great upside.   Potential Trade:  Miami Marlins Send: Matt Latos  Minnesota Twins Send: Nick Gordon, Max Kepler  Nick Gordon – The brother of Dee Gordon, Nick Gordon seems to profile out to stay a short stop. He is posting very similar lines to his brother and having both on the team would be a huge for the Marlins in terms of marketing. He is an inferior arm to Adeiny Hechavarria but should finish out an overall better option. It should be noted that Nick Gordon could be a stretch but Jorge Polanco is already a SS ready prospect with a similar tool set.  Max Kepler – One of the very first prospects to come from Germany Kepler flashes immense potential but still has a lot of development ahead of him before making an impact. This is the type of developmental player the Marlins should be targeting however."

letsgofish,3clavq,jigokusabre,2,Wed Jul 8 23:10:32 2015 UTC,I'm getting killed in the baseball subreddit. I don't understand why people think Capps jumps off the ground. Has anyone ever seen him do that this year??

letsgofish,3chgd5,Navi401,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:26:36 2015 UTC,As much as I love the Marlins I'm not sure why he is so hyped. Sure he has some gas but it's never amounted to my h in the minors. Him and Appel are the two that dumbfound me and just don't see the connection anymore.
letsgofish,3chgd5,JoshuaSP,4,Tue Jul 7 23:41:27 2015 UTC,He's still only 19. Most guys don't even start to develop secondary pitches until that age.

letsgofish,3cgspg,MarlinsBot,-6,Tue Jul 7 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"Fuck the Red Sox. I refuse to go to other teams GDT that bash Capps delivery, errr he throws hard err illegal"

letsgofish,3cgspg,JL16,3,Wed Jul 8 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's illegal, but it's not unreasonable to find it questionable the first time you encounter it.  *Edit: Although MLB considers it legal as long as he keeps that back foot down, it was apparently considered illegal in the minors. His delivery is definitely a bit dicey. I don't see the point of being adamantly irritated by people questioning his delivery."
letsgofish,3cgspg,mmann-ion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:14:19 2015 UTC,Because every team we encounter does this. It's gets old. He was sent down last year to fix delivery to make sure it fit the rules and he did.
letsgofish,3cgspg,JL16,3,Wed Jul 8 03:32:44 2015 UTC,"The reason every team you encounter does this is because it's the most bizarre delivery. Jerry Remy the color commentator for NESN that displays the Red Sox games immediately said he doesn't think that's legal. I don't think Jerry Remy has ever seen it before in his life. Only time Capps ever played the Sox was in 2012 and 2013. 2013 Jerry Remy had to take a leave of absence for the majority of the season because his stupid son decided to murder someone.  That time Carter Capps was on the Seattle Mariners. This is the first time a majority of us ever encountered this. And when Jerry points it out, then a lot of fans will realize it and question it.  I understand it must get frustrating as a Marlins fan because you see it every single appearance he makes... but us Red Sox fans aren't the typical NLEast opponents you'd see on a regular basis. We see you every three or so seasons."
letsgofish,3cgspg,DatabaseCentral,4,Wed Jul 8 07:04:04 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure that's basically at least half the entire MLB then.

The Marlins lead baseball with a 52.4% GB rate, which doesn't bode too well. Second place Giants are at 48.9%, and that's a huge margin. That 4% difference is the gap between 2nd and 13th place."

letsgofish,3c8d5s,camboss,3,Sun Jul 5 21:39:46 2015 UTC,I love me some Valdy!
letsgofish,3c8d5s,stupidsexyrumham,4,Sun Jul 5 21:29:32 2015 UTC,He won't be there for long. Its important to get him back on track by the all star break. Ichiro will take his place for the few games he misses. Good move
letsgofish,3c8d5s,jak1192,4,Mon Jul 6 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/Navi401 what is the chance we see a Isael Soto in the bigs some time soon, with Stanton on the DL, OZ in AAA and Ichiro getting a case of the olds."
letsgofish,3c8d5s,iharland,3,Mon Jul 6 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"0%. Hitting way below the mendoza line at Greensboro, got injured a month ago. Cant remember the injury, I can look it up later.  Edit: Placed on DL w/ Left Lateral Meniscus injury on May 3rd, 2015.  Edit 2: I asked my friends and they say the meniscus is a ligment in the knee and it can keep you out 6 months to 1 year."
letsgofish,3c8d5s,Navi401,4,Mon Jul 6 10:16:39 2015 UTC,What is the chance that we see him in the bigs in a year?
letsgofish,3c8d5s,beefat99,3,Mon Jul 6 14:17:19 2015 UTC,1%. He is still only 18 y/o. He is among the youngest in the Sally league.
letsgofish,3c8d5s,Navi401,7,Mon Jul 6 14:43:32 2015 UTC,Are these people retarded? Who is going to replace him? I know Ozuna is struggling but who is better?
letsgofish,3c8d5s,MarlinsGuy,6,Sun Jul 5 21:33:57 2015 UTC,You can give Morse another crack by putting him in LF and shifting Yeli to CF. I don't mind sending Ozuna down to work on getting his power swing back. He was 1 for his last 39 or something like that.
letsgofish,3c8d5s,camboss,4,Sun Jul 5 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"Well Morse was having trouble getting hits in triple-a and had a 37% K-rate in the minors, so that hardly seems like a better option. Add that on to the fact that he is a huge liability defensively (especially in the outfield) and this just does not seem like a good idea."
letsgofish,3c8d5s,MarlinsGuy,5,Sun Jul 5 22:08:11 2015 UTC,Ozuna was rushed to the majors out of necessity. People forget that he spent less than 10 games at AA in 2013. This is good for him.
letsgofish,3c8d5s,DoctorTheWho,6,Sun Jul 5 22:47:21 2015 UTC,I agree 100% Joc Peterson and Carlos Correa could have succeeded last year but getting 300+ ABs at AAA helped them become stars.
letsgofish,3c8d5s,Navi401,5,Mon Jul 6 00:25:07 2015 UTC,So...2014 didn't happen?
letsgofish,3c8d5s,eddy5791,5,Sun Jul 5 22:58:32 2015 UTC,A lot of guys that get rushed to the show do well their first year and then struggle. He still had a shitty OBP last year and struck out 160+ times.
letsgofish,3c8d5s,DoctorTheWho,3,Sun Jul 5 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"One decent year doesn't mean much. Jeremy Hermida had a 27 homer season. He just couldn't repeat.  Edit: Actually, he didn't. Ignore me. Pretend you didn't see this...  Edit 2: Hermida had a pretty decent 3 years with us. He didn't live up to expectations, but I'd take ~15 hrs and ~.330 OBP. It's weird because I remember us trading or DFAing him because he was sucking, but his stats don't say that."

letsgofish,3c21tu,scooper1030,5,Sat Jul 4 01:08:00 2015 UTC,It's probably just the new Shrek we're seeing. Someone that's just sorta good but gonna give up quite a few hits
letsgofish,3c21tu,SoddenEye,5,Sat Jul 4 01:22:17 2015 UTC,And he also signed a ball for me at the ballpark!  And had a really long conversation with two super religious dudes. He exchanged two signed balls for a book lol.   Then thanked the Lord for the weather.
letsgofish,3c21tu,destinybond,5,Sat Jul 4 02:46:08 2015 UTC,"Damn, I knew he was religious but is he that intense about it?"
letsgofish,3c21tu,destinybond,5,Sat Jul 4 02:51:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it appears so"
letsgofish,3c21tu,Navi401,4,Sat Jul 4 03:05:23 2015 UTC,Can you do me a favor and look up in his b-ref page stats like Inherited Runners Scored and Average Leverage to see in what role he is being used and how well he may be doing?
letsgofish,3c21tu,Navi401,6,Sat Jul 4 01:45:07 2015 UTC,"He's had 12 inherited runners in those 12.1 innings, with an IS% of 67%. The average leverage since he lost the closer role is .83, but on the season as a whole it's 1.75.   That average leverage of .83 is most comparable to the role he played during the 2011 season, when the leverage was at .88. But that season his IS% was just 19%.  So basically, Steve is keeping his ERA low, but he's still letting inherited runners score because of all the hits he's given up. He's still looking a lot better overall though."
letsgofish,3c21tu,Navi401,4,Sat Jul 4 01:57:35 2015 UTC,So basically Steve Cishek is currently the 2014 Dan Jennings. His ERA is low as fuck because none of the guys he puts on score but everyone else's baserunners score freely.
letsgofish,3c21tu,stupidsexyrumham,3,Sat Jul 4 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"Ya.  A 12.1 IP sample size with 12 inherited runners isn't enough to conclude anything really. But technically, Cishek's current 67% IS percentage is worse than 2014 Jennings' 41%."
letsgofish,3c21tu,jigokusabre,4,Sat Jul 4 02:08:12 2015 UTC,I dont want to make a new thread about this but we've won like 5 of the last 6. Without Stanton. With Hech in the 3 hole. With DJ managing. This seems crazy to me and I cant figure out which of the three has the most impact on our performance.

I'm glad Dee is no longer a Dodger.  And nice to see you got your stud back on the mound. Hopefully he is fixed.  And wtf Bour? I haven't heard of him and I hate him with a passion. 1) for basically sweeping us. 2) he will keep Morse on the bench."
letsgofish,3bvat4,throwd_away8675309,2,Thu Jul 2 23:15:01 2015 UTC,"Apparently, we just do well against the Giants for some odd reason for the past few years. Usually, we just choke, or people make mistakes, or something shitty happens. Like injuries.  Justin Bour has been a really nice surprise for us since we picked him up from the Rule 5 draft from the Cubs back in 2013 and he first got called up as a substitute when our starters made the DL. This year, Morse actually helped him get more starting playtime in the first place considering that he wasn't been hitting so well and then went on the DL. Since then Bour's our 2nd best slugger of the season (when it's supposed to be Ozuna) so there's that."
letsgofish,3bvat4,Harrason,4,Fri Jul 3 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you Marlins for sweeping the Giants. Glad to also see the most exciting pitcher in baseball, Jose Fernandez, back."

letsgofish,3bvat4,destinybond,3,Thu Jul 2 18:55:13 2015 UTC,Positivity: Kontos with his 20th runners inherited and none scored.
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,3,Thu Jul 2 18:53:49 2015 UTC,No pressure Ramos.
letsgofish,3bvat4,Number333,4,Thu Jul 2 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"Alright Ramos, lets see it"
letsgofish,3bvat4,destinybond,3,Thu Jul 2 18:50:57 2015 UTC,"Before I leave and never come back, do you guys know that it still says ""2014 MLB Important Dates""?"
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, I never noticed that. I wonder why no one ever pointed that out before you"
letsgofish,3bvat4,Navi401,2,Thu Jul 2 19:20:06 2015 UTC,My annoyingly tiresome need to be pedantic.  It's a gift...and a curse.
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,2,Thu Jul 2 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"/u/Navi401?  The dates were updated, but I dont think the table name was"
letsgofish,3bvat4,destinybond,2,Thu Jul 2 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"For sure, unless Fernandez going away is a yearly occurrence."
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,5,Thu Jul 2 19:07:06 2015 UTC,Jeff Mathis is the worst thing to ever happen to Miami. I didn't think anyone would ever knock Hurricane Andrew down to 2nd place...
letsgofish,3bvat4,DoctorTheWho,2,Thu Jul 2 18:49:09 2015 UTC,"Mathis is for sure going to finish with a negative WAR, his defense isn't good enough anymore to justify this shit."
letsgofish,3bvat4,doyouunderstandlife,2,Thu Jul 2 18:48:19 2015 UTC,Fucking Mathis. Of course.

letsgofish,3bvat4,UWannaBeHighForThis,2,Thu Jul 2 18:45:02 2015 UTC,Am I crazy or are we actually doing better without Stanton? Does it have something to do with Jennings shitty lineups?
letsgofish,3bvat4,DoctorTheWho,3,Thu Jul 2 18:43:36 2015 UTC,I think it's more to do with Bour hittng 3 HRs and Yelich getting on base 13 times.
letsgofish,3bvat4,UWannaBeHighForThis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:47:52 2015 UTC,Exactly it seems like a lot of team is stepping up right now.

letsgofish,3bvat4,doyouunderstandlife,3,Thu Jul 2 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"Oh God, Mathis is up. Already bracing myself for an inning-ending double play."
letsgofish,3bvat4,bambino0519,3,Thu Jul 2 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"Oh c'mon Mathis, give us a hit!"
letsgofish,3bvat4,destinybond,6,Thu Jul 2 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"To whoever thought 30k was optimistic for attendance today, final number is 32.5k"
letsgofish,3bvat4,JL16,2,Thu Jul 2 18:42:06 2015 UTC,Mathis please don't hit a grounder to shortstop
letsgofish,3bvat4,Pimpinpinguino,2,Thu Jul 2 18:42:00 2015 UTC,Damn we almost went a whole game without Craig!
letsgofish,3bvat4,Harrason,2,Thu Jul 2 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"Rojas hasn't hit much in his last 4 games or so. This game, he's 3 for 4? That's amazing stuff."
letsgofish,3bvat4,Briarsaunt,4,Thu Jul 2 18:41:42 2015 UTC,Miguel rojas tripled!!!! SCREAMING AND CRYING. one of my favorites!!! ♥♥♥
letsgofish,3bvat4,jigokusabre,3,Thu Jul 2 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"Kike Hernandez tripled last night, didn't he?"

letsgofish,3bvat4,destinybond,3,Thu Jul 2 19:04:18 2015 UTC,I have like 50 Ken Griffey Jr rookie cards and they are each worth about 5 cents each!  Edit: I also have a bunch of Miguel Cabrera rookie carda including the error one which are probablt worth a lot
letsgofish,3bvat4,Harrason,3,Thu Jul 2 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"They printed so many goddam Jr. cards it was ridiculous. I think there are a couple that are worth a decent amount, but in general they're worth nothing. I should have mentioned that the Posey cards are actually signed as well."
letsgofish,3bvat4,doyouunderstandlife,3,Thu Jul 2 18:40:58 2015 UTC,That Jose homer... oh baby

letsgofish,3bvat4,CenturionElite,3,Thu Jul 2 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"Please don't blow it, bullpen."
letsgofish,3bvat4,egodies,4,Thu Jul 2 18:25:45 2015 UTC,Tuned into radio just in time for Busty's homer.  Huge flaw of baseball at work is the lack of alcohol.
letsgofish,3bvat4,CenturionElite,3,Thu Jul 2 18:25:35 2015 UTC,Capps is not on lock tonight!
letsgofish,3bvat4,JL16,3,Thu Jul 2 18:24:33 2015 UTC,YOU ALL ARE POSTING WITHOUT THE CAPPS LOCK ON OF COURSE HE GAVE UP A HOMER

letsgofish,3bvat4,destinybond,2,Thu Jul 2 18:27:35 2015 UTC,Can't leave that up to a guy like posey
letsgofish,3bvat4,doyouunderstandlife,2,Thu Jul 2 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I can't say I remember the last time Capps has given up a run."
letsgofish,3bvat4,CenturionElite,2,Thu Jul 2 18:24:16 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it was the home run to Cargo at Coors Field.
letsgofish,3bvat4,ohGeeRocket,2,Thu Jul 2 18:26:36 2015 UTC,Posey hits too many homers
letsgofish,3bvat4,JL16,4,Thu Jul 2 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how this game ends, Jose will still be undefeated at home!   #thestreakcontinues"
letsgofish,3bvat4,nekromantique,2,Thu Jul 2 18:22:43 2015 UTC,Bour is all or nothing cause you know he isnt going to beat the throw to first
letsgofish,3bvat4,jigokusabre,3,Thu Jul 2 18:21:42 2015 UTC,Where the hell was that pitch? Definitely looked low to me
letsgofish,3bvat4,Harrason,4,Thu Jul 2 18:20:06 2015 UTC,Yea it wasn't a strike but that's the only way the Giants can get yelich out this series
letsgofish,3bvat4,alkaline810,2,Thu Jul 2 18:21:40 2015 UTC,Ya know... there seem to be little to no giants fans in here.    I don't know if that's a bad thing because having a bunch of opposing fans in the thread when Capps pitches tends to lead to a lot of complaining.
letsgofish,3bvat4,jigokusabre,2,Thu Jul 2 18:20:00 2015 UTC,The game started at 9 AM on the west coast. I can tell you that's a total pain to participate in GDTs on weekday mornings.
letsgofish,3bvat4,nekromantique,2,Thu Jul 2 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"Quite a few of them were here the first day. Since then they've been huddling up in their GDT instead.  I guess it's a bit hard to swallow for some of them when a team that you are supposed to be technically winning against is on the verge of sweeping you.  Worse off, they were supposed to win yesterday's game, and I don't blame them for thinking that. Hopefully some of them will get over that in our future series. Love the Giants myself and I would hate to see animosity between the fans."
letsgofish,3bvat4,Supersace56,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:17 2015 UTC,A lot of us are just waking up!
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,2,Thu Jul 2 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"I think similar things happened in our visits to the Giants and Dodgers GDTs earlier this season. When things look grim, participating at all (much less in the other teams GDT) seems less enchanting.   Giants fans have been good to us."
letsgofish,3bvat4,Supersace56,2,Thu Jul 2 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not saying they're bad...just that it's nice not seeing a million ""illegal"" comments.  It's refreshing."
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"Can't blame them. They're on the losing side of a match where their starting pitcher just got back, where Carter Capps took the mound, and Bour has been dominating this series.  I can understand them not being here"
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,2,Thu Jul 2 18:21:58 2015 UTC,"Fuck you guys.  A bunch of Dodgers lovers, that what yall are!  Yea, I went there!  Losing 2 games to the dodgers AND threatening to sweep us?"
letsgofish,3bvat4,Supersace56,2,Thu Jul 2 18:27:47 2015 UTC,We don't want to be in the middle of your rivalry hate-fests but it's so inevitable
letsgofish,3bvat4,contextplz,2,Thu Jul 2 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"If anything, you guys are worse than the dodgers, at least they repeatedly roll over for us.  WORSE THAN THE DODGERS!!!"

letsgofish,3bvat4,nekromantique,3,Thu Jul 2 18:09:49 2015 UTC,Yeah i hope you're mad at yourself Dunn. We are too. Ya scrub.
letsgofish,3bvat4,Harrason,4,Thu Jul 2 18:09:45 2015 UTC,How the fuck do you strike out the first two then forget how to pitch? No team should have a dude with an era over 4 coming out of the bullpen
letsgofish,3bvat4,nekromantique,3,Thu Jul 2 18:09:42 2015 UTC,IS CAPPS CLOSING? CAUSE THAT WILL BE GREAT.
letsgofish,3bvat4,Harrason,2,Thu Jul 2 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't see who was warming up/coming in...but Capps is usually the 8th inning guy.  Unless Ramos starts to struggle, I don't see a reason to take the closing spot from him."
letsgofish,3bvat4,destinybond,2,Thu Jul 2 18:11:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit of a waste to have him only pitch for a 0.1 inning, but either way it goes I have no complaints. Ramos is good, Capps is good."
letsgofish,3bvat4,Supersace56,2,Thu Jul 2 18:13:12 2015 UTC,It's the 7th inning...Capps can still pitch the 8th

letsgofish,3bvat4,Pimpinpinguino,2,Thu Jul 2 18:02:10 2015 UTC,He likes to lure teams in by pitching terribly for multiple games and then having a spectacular outing when they least expect it.

letsgofish,3bsiz2,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Thu Jul 2 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"It'll depend if you guys ever tie it.  As it stands, it would be Dyson's L."
letsgofish,3bsiz2,contextplz,2,Thu Jul 2 01:17:05 2015 UTC,Dyson? I would think it would be on Haren since he let go of the lead. That's why I'm asking. Haren gave 1 run that gave you the lead. So he has the loss. But Dyson added to it.
letsgofish,3bsiz2,Design_with_Whiskey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:18:56 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Losing pitcher is the one who gives up the leading run that isn't relinquished.

letsgofish,3bsiz2,contextplz,3,Thu Jul 2 01:23:59 2015 UTC,"Haren gave up the home run to Crawford that broke the tie, so it is Haren's loss as it stands."

letsgofish,3bsiz2,contextplz,2,Thu Jul 2 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"Ah! See ok. Now if we score 1 run, would it then switch to Dyson's loss?"
letsgofish,3bsiz2,Design_with_Whiskey,3,Thu Jul 2 01:40:21 2015 UTC,"Nope. It's Haren's loss until the Marlins tie the game again. The loss goes to whichever pitcher allows the baserunner that scores the go-ahead run to reach base. It doesn't matter what happens after that, unless the lead changes hands."
letsgofish,3bsiz2,Fluttertwi,2,Thu Jul 2 01:42:25 2015 UTC,"Ah. Makes sense. That would suck for a pitcher who only gives up one, but his reliever gives up 7 and his team only gets 6 runs (never being ahead or tieing)"

Considering that there is no one on the  bench who can hit righties as well as Bour, there is no one to give him a break besides Baker who only now starts against lefties; Bour is being overworked.  In regards to those 2 errors, I would put the blame on Hechavarria; the first being thown wide and the recent play was started where Hech was in a weird position to begin with.  Apologies for the rant, I just wanted that out there.  TL;DR: Bour is being overworked, don't factor out Hech on those plays."
letsgofish,3bsiz2,Supersace56,3,Thu Jul 2 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But I believe the second error was on him. That being said, he was JUST called up THIS SEASON. It's gonna take time for him level out. He was on a hot steak. Now he's in a slump (with some slump breaking plays/hits). He's a rookie plain and simple. He really doesn't have a vet to help him out. Again, hopefully Morse comes back strong so Bour can learn and adjust."

letsgofish,3bfvku,Bobb_o,4,Sun Jun 28 21:27:48 2015 UTC,Jessica Blaylock sucks
letsgofish,3bfvku,BroomPerson21,4,Mon Jun 29 00:17:16 2015 UTC,She's at least gotten better over the season.
letsgofish,3bfvku,stix1020,3,Mon Jun 29 00:17:56 2015 UTC,She just seems so monotone on the mic.
letsgofish,3bfvku,peanutmanak47,3,Mon Jun 29 00:25:44 2015 UTC,I use to listen to her on the radio up here in Jacksonville. Was happy to hear she got that job down there. I think she's gotten better as the season has gone on.  She is a chick who really does know sports though.
letsgofish,3bfvku,Pimpinpinguino,4,Mon Jun 29 03:10:10 2015 UTC,I remember feeling the same way about Allison when she first started. She was kinda weird at first but then she started to get more confident.

letsgofish,3bgjf5,DoctorTheWho,6,Mon Jun 29 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"It's June and we're already talking about the offseason? Damn, we really are hopeless."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,jetlife_,5,Mon Jun 29 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Marlins are 15 games under .500. I don't have the histories in front of me, but I doubt there's much president for a team this far under this late in the season making a legitimate run... and the Marlins will have to do with without one of the two players who are currently above average hitters."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,jigokusabre,3,Mon Jun 29 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"I was more talking about the fact that we don't know how our guys will play through the rest of the season; there is a ton of baseball left. I.E if Morse comes back and hits .300 for power, we probably wouldn't really need to go after a 1B in the offseason."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,jetlife_,4,Mon Jun 29 18:48:33 2015 UTC,That's a fair point.
letsgofish,3bgjf5,jigokusabre,3,Mon Jun 29 20:05:00 2015 UTC,This is what happens when the team has 3 legitimate players...
letsgofish,3bgjf5,camboss,6,Mon Jun 29 04:13:01 2015 UTC,"I would love me a 1B upgrade over Morse, but the FA pool is weak for 1B. BUT what about trading Ozuna for a 1B? Heard Clark Spencer today talk about Ozuna being on the block because of varying factors like Scott Boras and not meeting expectations. Then we could try to get a CFer in FA like Fowler or Span. Either one of those would make for a great 2-hole hitter behind Dee reminiscent of the 1-2 punch we had with Pierre and Castillo."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,HomeRahn,5,Mon Jun 29 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"I'm all for trading Ozuna. He's a RF, and will always be playing out of position in CF.   A team would give up a good haul for him."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,DatabaseCentral,3,Mon Jun 29 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely pick up some bullpen help, we don't need high end pricey relievers,  also maybe look at Alex Avila, and a 1b, Davis and encarnacion will probably be re-signed by their respective teams so maybe check out Napoli also re-sign Baker."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,jigokusabre,3,Mon Jun 29 01:52:37 2015 UTC,"Encarnacion's option will definitely be picked up.   I could see Chris Davis and Mike Napoli as the only two startable 1B. Napoli though is very iffy in terms of ""Startable"". He is atrocious this year, so that may get him on the cheap for a team, but shouldn't be seen as an upgrade.. over.. well.. anyone."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,DatabaseCentral,3,Mon Jun 29 05:35:25 2015 UTC,Chris Davis would be a bad fit for the team. We need a 1b that hits for a higher average.
letsgofish,3bgjf5,Navi401,3,Mon Jun 29 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"Besides, if memory serves, most of Davis' production comes from HRs (rather than doubles), which Marlins Park actively suppresses."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,camboss,3,Mon Jun 29 18:23:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. Napoli is a low average guy.. but still has a decent OBP. I wouldn't advise getting him. The 1B market this year is really thin.
letsgofish,3bgjf5,Navi401,3,Mon Jun 29 21:08:53 2015 UTC,"The 1B FA market is weak this offseason, which is why Korean first baseman, Byung-ho Park, that is likely to be posted will probably get some attention."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,camboss,3,Mon Jun 29 10:12:23 2015 UTC,Marlins have a history with Korean 1B - Hee Seop Choi (spelling?)
letsgofish,3bgjf5,Navi401,2,Mon Jun 29 17:49:47 2015 UTC,I am not a very big historian but I just looked him up on BR and he play only 95 games with us. I wouldn't say we have a history of Korean players.
letsgofish,3bgjf5,egodies,3,Mon Jun 29 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"Well, it was a beautiful 95 games. He wasn't really that good. I believe he was included in the trade with the dodgers along with Brad Penny that brought over Paul LoDuca and Guillermo Mota."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,Navi401,2,Mon Jun 29 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Again, I am not a historian so I dont know who those guys are. I didnt even know of Brad Penny before we resigned him last year."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,camboss,3,Mon Jun 29 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hee-Seop Choi came up through the US minors despite being Korean born. He had a great potential which he never really reached til after he left the US and played for the first time in the KBO.   Byung-ho Park by comparison has established himself with similar numbers that Jung-ho Kang was putting up last year, so I'm sure everyone hopes that continues to translate to decent production over here."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,beefat99,2,Mon Jun 29 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"Park hit 52 HR last year and has 22 already this year. I know Korea is very hitters friendly but damn, if a team doesn't have someone like Miggy, A-Gon, Abreu or Goldy as their 1B i dont see why they shouldnt be interested."
letsgofish,3bgjf5,tohon75,3,Mon Jun 29 22:36:44 2015 UTC,Why Alex Avila? We are set at Catcher with Realmuto. Would rather use those resources for something else.
letsgofish,3bf29b,gatorspader,6,Sun Jun 28 17:20:22 2015 UTC,We won yesterday = Hech is a good #3 hitter!
letsgofish,3bf29b,ziggmiceter,2,Sun Jun 28 17:24:39 2015 UTC,Can't really argue with that logic
letsgofish,3bf29b,EyeoftheTyga,7,Tue Jun 30 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"Is he completely ignoring sabermetrics?    Probably, the Marlins are one of the least sabermetrically inclined teams in baseball.   But given Hech's performance over the past three seasons and the fact that he's played literally every day (barring injury) and despite that they want to keep him around, they believe in Hech as an Ozzie Smith like talent."
letsgofish,3bf29b,jigokusabre,5,Sun Jun 28 17:46:35 2015 UTC,I have no problem sticking with Hech at the moment actually. At this point he is the Marlins best option since his defense makes up for offensive deficiencies. But to put him at the three spot shows incompetence. And it is pretty depressing.
letsgofish,3bf29b,jigokusabre,4,Sun Jun 28 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"Right... and for whatever the reason, his defense is actually an asset this season, as opposed to the previous two. Hech is (at this point) probably the 3rd or 4th best SS in the NL.   My larger point is that the Marlins beleive in him, his glove, hit bat, his everything."
letsgofish,3bf29b,DoctorTheWho,4,Sun Jun 28 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"I don't want him hitting 3rd either, because he has done so well in the 8th spot, which is hard to do."
letsgofish,3bf29b,jetlife_,4,Sun Jun 28 19:25:21 2015 UTC,I never really understood why we moved Stanton out of the four spot in the first place. Seems there hasn't been any offensive improvement from this team since we made that...  Was it because we didn't have anybody who was properly protecting Stanton in the lineup at the four spot?
letsgofish,3bf29b,nekromantique,3,Sun Jun 28 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"That probably has a lot to do with it honestly.  Also, if someone gets on, you're almost guaranteed to see him that inning, and if not, he's leading off the next inning which makes it a bit more likely that he sees something to hit.  I don't think it's helped the offense as a whole (because just about everyone except Gordon is underperforming right now) but it seems to have helped Stanton."
letsgofish,3bf29b,Bobb_o,5,Mon Jun 29 02:17:55 2015 UTC,I'd rather have ichiro 3rd and Yelich 4th but who cares the team is run by idiots.
letsgofish,3bf29b,panthers21546,3,Sun Jun 28 21:24:10 2015 UTC,"While I agree he shouldn't bad 3rd, it's extremely stupid to bring up OBP. He's been in the 8 hole for most of the year. The 8 hitter isn't supposed to walk, they are supposed to attack the pitches they see early in the count.   Plus who else is gonna bat 3rd? Sure as hell isn't Ozuna. There really aren't many options."
letsgofish,3bf29b,jigokusabre,2,Sun Jun 28 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"8 hitters also tend to get their share of IBBs, since they bat before the pitcher."
letsgofish,3bf29b,panthers21546,2,Mon Jun 29 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"While it is the 8 hitters job to be aggressive, Hechevarria has never had a good OBP. At any level, or in any spot in the lineup. And if noone is on base the 8 hitters job is to get on base so the pitcher can bunt him over. So you are wrong. Most of the time it is his job to be on base, since, let's be honest, most of the time Hech comes up noone is on base.   Ozuna is not a great option either with his current slump, but at least he has a history of some pop. And his career OBP is better than Hech's too. So yeah even he is a better option.   So no, it is not extremely stupid to bring up OBP when talking about the 3 hitter. You know, the guy who gets the third most at bats in the lineup. Your argument makes you look foolish."
letsgofish,3bf29b,Supersace56,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"It is stupid to bring up his OBP because he ISN'T a 3 hitter just because he's hit there what, twice?  Remember that he's been a pretty weak hitter overall at all levels until he showed improvement in average last year, and this year he's had a solid average and his slugging has also improved. Maybe if he was moved to say 2nd in the order for a good amount of time, he could make the adjustment and become better in OBP. Players can improve, he is still young, it's possible.  You're argument about the 8 hitter is just wrong though. Pitchers don't pitch 8 hitters carefully and it is the hitter's job to jump on mistakes. If you watch Hech this is exactly what he does. You'll notice him swing very early in counts and take advantage of pitchers that are around the zone too much.   Since you want to call me foolish, what is the highest level you've played baseball at? Just curious as your argument makes you look as if you've never stepped foot on a field."
letsgofish,3bf29b,BroomPerson21,2,Mon Jun 29 03:43:09 2015 UTC,"Hech has been better batting eighth in the lineup not because he has been bad, but because he is one of those guys who hits decently there; which is hard to do in the first place."
letsgofish,3bf29b,panthers21546,4,Sun Jun 28 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"No shit. Jennings is a fucking moron. Yelich, Bour, Ozuna, would all be better choices."
letsgofish,3bf29b,BroomPerson21,3,Sun Jun 28 19:03:22 2015 UTC,Ozuna is slugging .355 this year. And Bour is extremely overrated.   Do agree that Jennings is a moron though.
letsgofish,3bf29b,jigokusabre,2,Sun Jun 28 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"Ozuna will snap out of it, and Bour has so much potential dude. Overrated? He's got real power and hits to all fields"
letsgofish,3bf29b,BroomPerson21,2,Sun Jun 28 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"If Bour has so much potential, why is he a 27 year old rookie? If he had any real potential, he not have been left exposed to the minor league Rule 5 draft."

letsgofish,3bd37h,destinybond,2,Sun Jun 28 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just got home from the game and he was having trouble placing the ball it seemed.  He walked the first batter of both the 1st and 2nd inning on 4 straight balls. It seemed he was working from behind the count more times than not.  He also threw a decent amount of pitches in the dirt well before home plate. I'm not entirely sure if he got the first batter out in any of the innings he pitched.  If it weren't for the two walks he gave up he would have only given up 2 runs, but those walks really hurt."

letsgofish,3bazt0,MiaCannons,3,Sat Jun 27 15:27:57 2015 UTC,Pack it up boys we're ending this season early. I have no idea why recently the miami teams (Heat and Dolphins) have been plagued with injuries but it sucks so much.  I'll be hyping the Phins until Stanton is back.

Probably Alvarez when he comes back. Maybe the occasional Nicolino/Urena too to see what we can expect in the future.  But this isn't like basketball, where at least I know that my bad team has a chance at drafting an impact player for the very next season. All we get is a high pick to reach for another Josh Naylor, who will either never make it to the bigs or will take 3-4 years.  If you couldn't tell, I'm pretty pissed. Sorry if it sounds like I'm bailing on the team."

Goodbye projected 60 homeruns, goodbye homerun derby, goodbye All Star game, goodbye wins.   I would rather have the Marlins fall last to get first draft pick this season, what else can we do now that we know our team can't keep itself together with injuries abound?  Ichiro is obviously Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-ly cool, but I want to see the orange sleeve in right field because Stanton adds that UMPH to the lineup... and Ichiro slaps singles. A cardinal sin for me by saying something that goes against the hivemind, but it's true.  Here's some Komm Süsser Tod to set the mood"

So I get a bottle, open the cap, take a sip and set it on the coffee table and suddenly a whole bunch of foam erupts out like a science fair volcano. What just happened?"
letsgofish,3azoee,schnaderhops,3,Wed Jun 24 23:23:51 2015 UTC,Essentially the same thing will happen when an asshole decides it'll be funny to knock the bottom of his bottle to your top. The trick to stop this is (warning: this is going to be described weirdly) to keep your bottle vertical and place your mouth over the opening. Suck out the air and foam from your bottle. Idk why but the foaming effect is substantially shortened. And the asshole is robbed of his joy in douchebaggery. (I may or not have been that asshole before - but I developed a strategy to avoid becoming a victim myself)
letsgofish,3azoee,jigokusabre,3,Wed Jun 24 23:22:59 2015 UTC,This or I've seen people drink beer by what seems like sucking on the bottle then setting the beer down to fast.
letsgofish,3azoee,JL16,3,Wed Jun 24 23:33:04 2015 UTC,Drink more to discover that the foam is just a meta physical form of your mind experiencing itself.
letsgofish,3azoee,jigokusabre,2,Wed Jun 24 23:41:34 2015 UTC,Vibration caused foaming. The foam hit the bottle neck and had no place to go but up.

These tiny blasts create mushroom clouds similar to those generated in the air by an atomic bomb.  ""Actually, the laws of physics that control the development of these beer mushroom clouds are the same as [those that drive] the development of the cloud in an atomic bomb,"" Rodriguez tells The Salt. ""Obviously, there's no nuclear stuff in the beer. So the source of the explosion is very different, but the mushroom cloud that you see is very similar."""

letsgofish,3b0t3h,DwyaneNotDwayne,6,Thu Jun 25 02:06:18 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.
letsgofish,3b0t3h,stupidsexyrumham,15,Thu Jun 25 02:17:00 2015 UTC,Honestly cant complain about attendance. When was the last time we made the playoffs? When was the last time we kept a franchise player? When was the last time we finished within 5 games of the division. It's just bad all around. It's a franchise with no stability.   And im a season ticket holder but i go to the games cause i grew up with baseball and i love it but i can understand why regular fans would be turned off.

Heaney being bad won't make Dee any better, nor will it improve the fortunes of the Marlins. Nothing good comes out of him pitching poorly."
letsgofish,3az8jp,jigokusabre,2,Wed Jun 24 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"Well.... you dodge all the ""told you so"" people who criticized Dee if he turns into a star. I agree you shouldn't be looking to tear guys down especially if they're incredible young but the Patriots in the NFL get a lot of praise for trading guys at the right time for a ton of value right as they decline."
letsgofish,3az8jp,Number333,6,Wed Jun 24 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"I mean he wasn't lights out with us, so maybe that's what you're getting at?"
letsgofish,3az8jp,SoddenEye,4,Wed Jun 24 18:15:03 2015 UTC,Neither was Josh Johnson (or Josh Beckett if memory serves) in their first 7 starts.
letsgofish,3az8jp,jigokusabre,4,Wed Jun 24 18:37:11 2015 UTC,Oh no I know that. I'm more saying he might be pissed that Heaney sucked with us and wants to see him suck with the Angels in return
letsgofish,3az8jp,SoddenEye,3,Wed Jun 24 18:43:20 2015 UTC,Heaney also sucked when he was s3nt back down...that's the disappointing part to me.

I will propose this: Let's say that it took a week for the dust to settle. Jennings started with a 5 game losing streak as a result. Since that time, the Marlins are 14-15 and their run differential is only -1. It was -20 before that. That's pretty amazing considering the injuries to our pitching. You could argue that Loria's plan may have worked.   Sincerely, The Silver Linings Sports Fan"

Scalpers are all over the place around the ballpark.  In fact last time I went to the Batting Cage before a game a scalper came up to my table and I bought tickets from him while I was eating (some might find this intrusive but I didn't care at the time).  The ballpark is in an area of town called Little Havana, which isn't really renowned for its bar scene.  Where are you going to be staying?  There are better bars in Coconut Grove, which is about 10-15 minutes away.  You could have drinks there and then Uber it over to the stadium as one option."
letsgofish,3aybl8,AsaBringman,5,Wed Jun 24 14:52:50 2015 UTC,"There isn't a ton right around the stadium, but the Clevelander is actually in the left field (you enter from outside the stadium). So there's an option if you're going to the game.  For tickets, lot of options. Not sure how good the Marlins box office is day of, but could check out SeatGeek (great on mobile), Stubhub, or Tixers. Disclosure: I work for Tixers, but we are generally below Stubhub prices and leave the listings up through game start."

letsgofish,3ava32,stupidsexyrumham,3,Wed Jun 24 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"Don't let the pressure of feeling like other people are watching you force you to lift more than you physically are capable of. When it comes to lifting it's more about the technique and less about the weight. Start small, get the technique right every single rep, and the strength will come in time."
letsgofish,3ava32,SoddenEye,3,Wed Jun 24 01:13:13 2015 UTC,Yeah one of the few compliments I get is that I go nice and slow like you're supposed to. Helps a bit.
letsgofish,3ava32,stupidsexyrumham,2,Wed Jun 24 01:15:44 2015 UTC,That's a good start. That's rule number one when it comes to weight lifting (besides knowing what you can and can't lift). When people lift too fast it screws up their technique and they waste a lot of valuable energy that muscles need to build bigger and stronger. Proper technique is far more important that any amount of weight.
letsgofish,3ava32,destinybond,2,Wed Jun 24 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"You should do some reading on Olympic lifts, that shit is important. Form is crucial. Start light for reps and work into a routine. I think my highest DL for a 1 rep max was 385."

Before the game I'd highly recommend checking out the Bobblehead Museum, the Budweiser Bow tie bar in left field, and just walking around and seeing the infamous HR sculpture, the Taste of Miami section near section 29, and the team store are all pretty interesting.   If it's your sort of scene, the Clevelander post game (and even pre game I think) is supposed to be fun too.  Hope you enjoy your experience! Marlins Park is a gem."

letsgofish,3aqchl,SoddenEye,6,Mon Jun 22 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"I would love it if the Marlins traded for Will Smith of the Brewers. The Marlins need a reliable arm out of the bullpen and someone that could get lefties out (yeah fuck you Mike Dunn. I swear, every time you come into a high leverage situation, you have a 50% of giving up a game tying or lead changing homerun). Will Smith would serve both of these needs.  Also, we could play Gettin' Jiggy Wit It every time he comes into a game.  As for who we would give up, maybe Adam Conley?  Also, forgot to mention that Will Smith is cheap, controllable, and only 25 years old."
letsgofish,3aqchl,camboss,7,Mon Jun 22 17:45:14 2015 UTC,I thought you were gonna go with welcome to Miami for his first year and then gettin jiggy would come along the second
letsgofish,3aqchl,PenaMan1987,3,Mon Jun 22 21:06:35 2015 UTC,I like the idea of getting a reliable LOOGy from someone. Maybe Boone Logan from Colorado or Will Smith from Milwaukee.   I would like to see the Marlins pick of a front end starter that under control for this year and next... but the only one I can think of that fits that list is Oakland's Jesse Chavez. (Viable trade pieces are Michael Morse/Justin Bour and Martin Prado/Derek Dietrich.)   We seem too far behind to make a big splash trade for Johnny Cueto or David Price or something.

letsgofish,3aqchl,EyeoftheTyga,2,Tue Jun 23 00:24:46 2015 UTC,I'd trade Derek Dietrich for pitching and a 3b prospect.
letsgofish,3aqchl,DoctorTheWho,2,Tue Jun 23 01:33:34 2015 UTC,I doubt Dietrich has any trade value but I'm sure the Marlins would love to get rid of him if they could.
letsgofish,3aqchl,panthers21546,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:45:33 2015 UTC,Why would you trade 3B Derek Dietrich for a 3B prospect?
letsgofish,3aqchl,jigokusabre,3,Tue Jun 23 18:02:27 2015 UTC,Probably because he doesn't think Dietrich is our 3B of the future.
letsgofish,3aqchl,jetlife_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:25:23 2015 UTC,"Because Dietrich can't play defense to save his life, and we can't hide him at 2b with Dee Gordon there.   An AL team short on power at 2b would give a decent package for him. Maybe a RP and an A ball, high potential guy."
letsgofish,3aqchl,DoctorTheWho,2,Tue Jun 23 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think that more has been made of his defensive issues than is actually there. Dee Gordon had similar defensive woes his first couple of seasons, and Hech showed pretty bad defensive metrics before this season, too."

He's stepped in nicely filling in for Prado, and he's hitting the ball hard. Can he be a long-term option at 3B? That has to be seen, but I think we should give him a legitimate chance. Of course if Loria hates him as much as we all think he'll be traded off before we get the chance to see it...."
letsgofish,3aqchl,Fus_Joe_Dah,2,Tue Jun 23 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"Loria is the owner. We all know he's too involved but that doesn't mean he sent him down. Even if he did, Dietrich deserved to be sent down.  Dietrich is a liability on defense. And he hits for a very low average. The power potential he has is nice though. I think this year might be his last ""chance"" as he's had a few now with the Marlins."

We have one of the worst attendance records in the league.   Also, what you have to understand about baseball culture is that while everyone you meet will be more than happy to chat with you, nobody is really going to be losing their minds out there. The energy level isn't the same as in soccer. When you have 162 games in a single season, fans do not take every game so seriously."
letsgofish,3amap5,scooper1030,4,Sun Jun 21 22:10:43 2015 UTC,"We really don't have tailgates for baseball. Especially since we have parking garages. BUT if you go early you can hang out with other fans before the game. I would suggest bringing a case of beer or bottle or whatever drinking preference in your car and hang out in the garage before hand to ""pregame"" as we call it. If you're not driving, pregame before you head out. Drinks are expensive. You can find cheap tickets on stubhub, groupon (sometimes), and seat geek. If you do plan to drive, remember to buy parking garage tickets. Or you can park on someone lawn for about $20 cash (or cheaper depending on distance). You can also use public transportation (but that's a little more difficult and you'll have to plan your route beforehand). We do offer Uber and I think Lyft is also available. Don't use taxis - they're too expensive. I recommend the Bullpen Reserve above visitors bullpen (section 30-32). It's in left field in front of the Budweiser porch and Taste of Miami. The Clevelander (a club-like area in left field) opens to the rest of the park for free after the 7th inning (because that's when the park stops serving alcohol but the Clevelander continues to serve). Just don't leave the park, cuz you won't be allowed back in. Have fun!   Also, people are as chill as you are. Meaning that if you're an ass, you're going to be treated like an ass. If you chill, no one will bother you. If you're fun, you'll have an entire section following your every command. I know soccer has team specific chants. We tend not to. But you will hear chants, learn them and start them. Easiest one: ""LETS GO MAR-LINS!"" CLAP CLAP CLAPCLAPCLAP If anything just ask a fan around you. Most will love to pass on knowledge of a sport they love. Especially older fans."
letsgofish,3amap5,Design_with_Whiskey,3,Sun Jun 21 21:27:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!! Good to know where you can get a nice buzz going =)
letsgofish,3amap5,silentnighthd,3,Mon Jun 22 12:31:12 2015 UTC,"Hi, glad to have you in the states!  Ok, so our team does not have a culture similar to European soccer, we do not have ultras for our baseball.  However, baseball is part of our country's blood and the culture is a relaxed one at games, it's a place to hang out watch some game and talk to your friends and eat food!    Marlins games in particular are a little lacking in intensity, but we have a beautiful stadium and I think you would really like it if you came.  If you don't know the story of our team I can tell you a little more about that if you want.   We don't really have tailgates for baseball games, but I would recommend going to a restaurant called Versailles, it is a Miami institution and a few fans stop there before games.  Book seats at the ""home run porch"" and then our ushers don't really care so you can move and sit wherever you want really.  If you have any more questions please feel free to PM me"

In 2014, he was named Marlins Minor League Pitcher of the Year and was the Most Outstanding Pitcher in the Southern League. •••  Image  Re-hosted     I'm just a bot that rehosts Instagram posts to Imgur.

letsgofish,3ajafq,camboss,4,Sat Jun 20 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see what can go wrong. Hand was a waste of a roster spot. The only thing that 'upsets' me is that Koehler could have been a valid candidate for the bullpen.  MLBTR also says that Nicolino is replacing Koehler today, but MLB has Koehler as the starting pitcher; I'm guessing they haven't updated that yet?"
letsgofish,3ajafq,Supersace56,3,Sat Jun 20 19:17:11 2015 UTC,Nope. I just posted. Instagram confirmed Nicolino is starting
letsgofish,3ajafq,Design_with_Whiskey,3,Sat Jun 20 19:21:33 2015 UTC,Yeah. I agree. Never liked Hand. I just wonder what we could be trading for. I don't see us improving anywhere other than the bullpen. But Hand and Koehler seem a little high for a bullpen arm. A 1B? I also dont think any 1B we can get with Hand + Koehler will be any better than the combo of Morse/Bour/Baker/Dietrich.  Edit: Maybe Prado's injury is worse than first led on?
letsgofish,3ajafq,Supersace56,3,Sat Jun 20 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"Well, when Cuban Jesus and Cosart return, the question would be where would we put Koehler in all of this?   He has shown that he can be phenomenal in short bursts for at least 3 to 4 innings and we've seen him in a reliever situation before as well coming in with 2 on base and out while getting out of it with no one scoring.  I'm wondering who we could get in return as well. Both Koehler and Hand would be high for 1 bullpen arm, but 2 could be about right. I don't see us getting any positional players in return, but that doesn't mean it isn't an option."
letsgofish,3ajafq,iharland,4,Sat Jun 20 19:35:18 2015 UTC,"I can't decide whether this looks like more of a buy or seller deal... Im very curious to see what this returns, because it feels like its missing a third piece from our end (to be a true buyer deal)."
letsgofish,3ajafq,jigokusabre,5,Sat Jun 20 19:32:13 2015 UTC,There could always be a minor leaguer involved. We'll just have to wait a little for more details to come out.
letsgofish,3ajafq,HomeRahn,3,Sat Jun 20 19:51:16 2015 UTC,"Neither.   Hand is worthless, and while Koehler might have value as a reliever, he's unlikely to pull in any kind of major free agent to be or team controlled asset. Most likely we'll get a stuggling/underacheiving player with the hope that changing scenery will improve performance."

Maybe one person wished injury on him, I'll have to take your word for it, /u/nekromantique, because I'm looking through and I can't find one... not to mention there was already one or two down-voting everything. Tension was obviously high after that walk to A-rod. Do you expect the thread to not blow up when your pitcher basically intentionally walks A-rod in the 8th with 2,999 hits? Can you honestly say that a similar scenario wouldn't play out if the roles were reversed? But you're acting as if we all starting acting like assholes to you guys, which is just not the case. No one was antagonizing your fans in the thread, no one was arguing, no one (except for the trolls) was downvoting. I'm looking at the thread right now. Don't generalize and stoop so low as to say we're all NY ""scumbags"". I'm not even from NY and I resent that... frankly I think it's uninformed and lazy to say that. There are always a few people who say stupid things in every team sub, and every sports team has bad fans. I'm sad that this is what you came away with from the series... but I still had fun with you guys being there and I'll see you all again sometime. Maybe this time in your sub."

letsgofish,3a5lwo,scooper1030,4,Wed Jun 17 12:19:55 2015 UTC,"I've been quiet so far because Urena only has like 4 starts so far and the league hasn't had time to adjust to him but those last two or three starts he looked really good in. There are a a ton of people that say guys like Jose Urena and Adam Conley are destined for the bullpen but from small amount of time we've seen him, Urena has showed the makings of a #3/4 pitcher."
letsgofish,3a5lwo,Navi401,3,Wed Jun 17 13:09:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm not getting my hopes up, but I like what I've seen so far. I'm going to see him in New York tonight, hopefully I'll get a better look at what he has in person."
letsgofish,3a5lwo,JL16,3,Wed Jun 17 13:14:19 2015 UTC,I think the bullpen idea comes from him not having more than 2 go to pitches which is usually what relievers have. If he can develop a third pitch he'd have starter stuff.
letsgofish,3a5lwo,MiaCannons,3,Wed Jun 17 20:30:02 2015 UTC,Yes
letsgofish,3a5lwo,ThaCarter,3,Wed Jun 17 18:04:08 2015 UTC,You can get a surprisingly accurate picture of a team with just a look at QS% and Winning % in Quality Starts.
letsgofish,3a5lwo,SoddenEye,5,Wed Jun 17 18:15:50 2015 UTC,What's with the DWade flair? lol I didn't know we had that
letsgofish,3a5lwo,ThaCarter,2,Wed Jun 17 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"Well I didn't know / remember I had it either, but now that I do I would never have it another way."
letsgofish,3a70wt,SoddenEye,4,Wed Jun 17 18:55:25 2015 UTC,Sloth is good but Sloth flair very good
letsgofish,3a70wt,beefat99,3,Wed Jun 17 20:03:40 2015 UTC,Can we get a Dong Gong?
letsgofish,3a70wt,iharland,2,Thu Jun 18 01:50:41 2015 UTC,Yes please Sloth flair.
letsgofish,3a70wt,bassace14,2,Thu Jun 18 02:52:10 2015 UTC,Any flair questions should probably be posed directly to /u/navi401
letsgofish,3a70wt,destinybond,2,Fri Jun 19 15:09:35 2015 UTC,Nope! I'll totally ask you only!

letsgofish,3a4mzm,SoddenEye,10,Wed Jun 17 04:53:06 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what the Jays were at when they started their streak.  Edit: It was 7 under, to be exact."
letsgofish,3a4mzm,Meowingtons-PhD,9,Wed Jun 17 05:15:20 2015 UTC,"It seriously is. Start small; win series, the focus on getting to .500. Once the team can show that they can keep at least .500, then start pushing harder and focus on contention.   Although it's easier to say than do, they can do it. Tonight was one of those games where they showed their potential, regardless of us facing a flaming-fastballer with no movement attached. To each their own opinion, if both offense and defense can stabilize themselves, we can be a solid team in the upcoming months."
letsgofish,3a4mzm,Supersace56,4,Wed Jun 17 05:20:56 2015 UTC,"Well we get Cosart and good Latos back, a resurgent Stanton, and new bats off the bench. Add onto that a revamped bullpen and I think we can make a run at the very least"
letsgofish,3a4mzm,Supersace56,7,Wed Jun 17 05:24:10 2015 UTC,Well we get Cosart and good Latos back   You forgot Cuban Jesus. You better repent because the Second Coming is July 2nd!

letsgofish,3a4mzm,DPerez6,11,Wed Jun 17 05:30:15 2015 UTC,I think it will be an inning
letsgofish,3a4mzm,jigokusabre,6,Wed Jun 17 05:52:39 2015 UTC,Just gotta keep winning series. 4 or 5 straight series wins means winning 9-12 games while only losing 2-5.
letsgofish,3a4mzm,beefat99,5,Wed Jun 17 06:09:41 2015 UTC,Can't get to 7 games under until you get to 8 games under. Can't get to 6 games under until you get to 7 games under. Can't get to 5 games under until you get to 6 games under.
letsgofish,3a4mzm,_BlueBomber_,4,Wed Jun 17 17:48:05 2015 UTC,WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO JINX OUR SUCCESS.  The Sloth does not approve...
letsgofish,3a4mzm,bassace14,5,Wed Jun 17 13:18:29 2015 UTC,Like Ive said before. Keep it under ten games until our pitchers return and we got a chance to make some noise.  Our hitting has been awesome as of late. Keep closing in on first place.

letsgofish,3a2utz,destinybond,5,Wed Jun 17 02:00:24 2015 UTC,no no leave us in the dark. not like people read the sidebar anyway
letsgofish,3a2utz,stupidsexyrumham,5,Wed Jun 17 02:03:49 2015 UTC,Yes /u/destinybond we should do this.

letsgofish,3a2utz,stupidsexyrumham,4,Wed Jun 17 02:07:53 2015 UTC,That kinda kills the whole inside joke aspect.

The above sentence is awkwardly constructed. I would recommend something like ""Since Mat Latos had a good outing after spending a few weeks on the DL, hopefully Jarred Cosart will do the same"". Hopefully that is the meaning you are trying to portray.  ""June 16th evening"" -> ""The evening of June 16th""  ""Jose Fernandez also announced that he would be returning July 2nd, after spending half a year on the DL, undergoing and then recovering from Tommy John Surgery.

letsgofish,3a1u96,stupidsexyrumham,7,Tue Jun 16 15:58:37 2015 UTC,I know this is probably not a favorable opinion but I think Jennings has done well as a manager so far. He has played some part in rallying the guys to keep winning after the media fiasco that was created by hiring Jennings. He is still learning how to be a manager too and I will be one to say that I didn't think this was a good move at all but I am beginning to think otherwise
letsgofish,3a1u96,Burquegreyhound,5,Tue Jun 16 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"I think Dan Jennings is a superb, high class manager but there are numerous ways the Marlins can do better.  You need not even look outside the city limits.  The one true manager for the Marlins, should be Al Golden."
letsgofish,3a1u96,superchronics,3,Tue Jun 16 19:39:19 2015 UTC,Now we're talkin
letsgofish,3a1u96,gobobluth,2,Tue Jun 16 19:40:51 2015 UTC,"Right. If you want someone who can take a team of talented players and potential all-stars and help them win 40% of their games, Golden is your man!"
letsgofish,3a1u96,jigokusabre,4,Wed Jun 17 10:49:22 2015 UTC,"Well, considering that ""total fucking disaster""  was the bar set with a total neophyte  taking the reins as a manager... the fact that it's not that is rather bland praise."
letsgofish,3a1u96,Burquegreyhound,3,Tue Jun 16 16:34:04 2015 UTC,He's not that new to managing. He left being a high school coach to be a scout because it was a better gig for him to take. Not to mention he has respect by everyone in baseball and is a big reason why Stanton chose to stay. Another example of no coaching experience is mike matheny and look what he has done as a coach despite the team he is coaching is a top 3 team in baseball
letsgofish,3a1u96,Burquegreyhound,5,Tue Jun 16 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"Matheny also played in the MLB from 1994-2006. Dan Jennings coached a high school team from 1985 through 1988. I think a big reason Stanton chose to stay was because he was offered a 325 million dollar contract, not because Dan Jennings is respected."
letsgofish,3a1u96,jigokusabre,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:52:37 2015 UTC,"If money was the motivation he could have gone to Boston, LA NY and they would've gladly paid him that. There's more to it than just the money"
letsgofish,3a1u96,Burquegreyhound,3,Tue Jun 16 16:55:11 2015 UTC,He was promised stability. He has yet to see that.
letsgofish,3a1u96,jigokusabre,3,Tue Jun 16 17:13:39 2015 UTC,"He left being a high school coach about 30 years ago. That's a huge fucking leap and a huge fucking gap.   I'm not suggesting that he doesn't know which end of the bat the hitter holds on to, but there's a fair amount of difference between being a scout and an executive and managing players and a team. Considering some of the rookie manager mistakes we've seen over the years, there was/is a lot of cause for concern."
letsgofish,3a1u96,Burquegreyhound,0,Tue Jun 16 16:54:31 2015 UTC,So how to veteran coaches learn to not make mistakes? By making mistakes and learning from mistakes. Also no respectable coach with veteran experience is coming to coach Miami anytime soon so the organization has to take some chances and understand the risk involved in taking those chances.
letsgofish,3a1u96,Burquegreyhound,3,Tue Jun 16 17:07:53 2015 UTC,"So how to veteran coaches learn to not make mistakes?   Usually either by making them in the minor leagues, or by coaching under another (experienced) manager and learning from them.   Also no respectable coach with veteran experience is coming to coach Miami anytime soon so the organization has to take some chances and understand the risk involved in taking those chances.   All the more reason that firing Redmond was a bad idea. (Or Ozzie for that matter)."
letsgofish,3a1u96,peanutmanak47,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion but i disagree. See my problem is the part where you said ""He is still learning how to be a manager."" That's kind of the issue. Also, there needs to be a separation between clubhouse and front office. You don't have that with Dan Jennings."
letsgofish,3a1u96,jigokusabre,0,Tue Jun 16 16:45:10 2015 UTC,Why do you think there needs to be a separation? I think it works in Jennings favor to see both the front office and clubhouse. He sees things that a front office guy wouldn't see on a daily basis and has a unique point of view that none of the organizations have
letsgofish,3a1u96,Burquegreyhound,3,Tue Jun 16 16:50:48 2015 UTC,Do you think the players actually respect what Jennings has to say to them? Jennings is nothing more than a yes man to Loria. He is there so the front office can tell him what to do then implement it into the game. As a player i would want to be able to go talk to my manager knowing it wouldn't get back to the front office and there would be full confidentiality. Players have to pick and choose their words wisely because the guy you're talking to is the guy who was making your contract. That's not ok in my opinion. Do you think players around the league want to come play for an organization for a manger like that? It's not appealing.
letsgofish,3a1u96,_BlueBomber_,-1,Tue Jun 16 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yes I do truly believe they respect DJ because it has been stated by reporters that he is a widely respected man in baseball both by players and executives. Dan Jennings is part of the reason why we have Dee Gordon, Prado, and Phelps so to say he is just a yes man to Loria without any proof is just an accusation. Also it is DJs discretion to reveal any information to the front office about what players are telling him. He is smart enough to know what needs to stay confidential and what he can reveal. To say players cannot say what they want to say to a manager they respect is far reaching. Finally, players didn't want to come to Miami because of Loria to begin with but are staying because they want to play with Stanton and if he is happy with Dan Jennings staying players will come to play despite DJ being the manager."

letsgofish,39ycru,Shmony,6,Tue Jun 16 01:38:03 2015 UTC,Horrible AB by Realmuto. Left a hanger and swung at one in the dirt.

letsgofish,39ycru,Shmony,4,Tue Jun 16 01:36:07 2015 UTC,What was the name of that guy who threw 100+ mph but had no control whatsoever. He was traded a bunch of times and pitched for us last (or last last)  season. His name was like Henry something or Something Henry i think
letsgofish,39ycru,Pimpinpinguino,6,Tue Jun 16 01:33:56 2015 UTC,Henry Rodriguez. He got a appearance or two with us last season. He pitched for the Nats in 2013.  EDIT: Last seen released by the D-Backs at the end of 2015 Spring Training.
letsgofish,39ycru,jigokusabre,2,Tue Jun 16 01:35:37 2015 UTC,Yeah thats him. I remember getting so excited when we got him thinking he would be thr next Chapman... Just goes to show control is everything

letsgofish,39ycru,jigokusabre,5,Tue Jun 16 01:30:51 2015 UTC,Do you guys think CAPPS is going to pitch the 9th or does Ramos go for the save?
letsgofish,39ycru,Pimpinpinguino,2,Tue Jun 16 01:30:22 2015 UTC,"Probably Ramos, you don't want to ruin Capps' arm for the rest of the series."
letsgofish,39ycru,iharland,3,Tue Jun 16 01:35:33 2015 UTC,Probably Ramos to have Capps again for tomorrow.
letsgofish,39ycru,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Tue Jun 16 01:32:42 2015 UTC,Looks like Ramos is getting loose.
letsgofish,39ycru,_BlueBomber_,3,Tue Jun 16 01:32:27 2015 UTC,Almost certainly Ramos.
letsgofish,39ycru,jigokusabre,4,Tue Jun 16 01:31:47 2015 UTC,It depends if we score anything more than 3 runs
letsgofish,39ycru,Supersace56,6,Tue Jun 16 01:31:04 2015 UTC,Probably Ramos. Looks like Capps already had a different jersey on or something. Probably done
letsgofish,39ycru,glassroc1,3,Tue Jun 16 01:30:55 2015 UTC,I was told that Loria already smelled the tacos he traded for Capps

letsgofish,39ycru,glassroc1,5,Tue Jun 16 01:30:18 2015 UTC,We should probably trade Capps before his arm falls off at his elbow.

letsgofish,39ycru,Design_with_Whiskey,6,Tue Jun 16 01:30:27 2015 UTC,Holy shit that delay between his slider and fastball is nasty. Milliseconds but that must throw you off so hard.

letsgofish,39tird,destinybond,3,Sun Jun 14 23:33:10 2015 UTC,because we're the marlins.
letsgofish,39tird,Pimpinpinguino,5,Sun Jun 14 23:45:33 2015 UTC,I knew this would happen
letsgofish,39tird,camboss,5,Sun Jun 14 17:40:20 2015 UTC,Poor use of resources if they do. A cheaper set up man or lefty specialist is more needed. Ramos is doing fine as closer. Getting the ball to Ramos has been a concern.   Chapman is still cheap for this year and next. It would take a pretty prospect to pry him away from Cincinnati.
letsgofish,39tird,iharland,5,Sun Jun 14 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"It would take Kolek and/or Nicolino with maybe someone else too. I agree a poor choice. Give Capps the ball more, guys seems to be a work horse. We have a strong pen when it's firing on all cylinders.  We just had Cishek problems."
letsgofish,39tird,camboss,4,Sun Jun 14 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Cishek problems aside, I don't have trust in Mike Dunn. We need a true lefty specialist that can get tough lefties out. Mike Dunn is the same against righties and lefties and has a propensity to give up the long ball during high leverage situations."
letsgofish,39tird,MPreaper94,3,Sun Jun 14 18:07:50 2015 UTC,Nooo stop...!
letsgofish,39tird,jigokusabre,3,Mon Jun 15 07:08:30 2015 UTC,No doubt it would be an upgrade... but it's hard to imagine that the cost would be acceptable.
letsgofish,39tird,Navi401,3,Mon Jun 15 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"Obviously Aroldis Chapman would be a great addition but the asking price will surely be too high for the Marlins to pull the trigger on so how about we target someone like Tyler Clippard from the Athletics instead? Who we know has been a reliable, consistant guy from his time with the Nationals.  Also, what about buying high on Atlanta's Jim Johnson? Who is only two seasons removed from back to back 50 saves seasons. My limited understanding and wariness of advanced stats point to his peripherals being not so distant from his 2012/2013 years."
letsgofish,39tird,docloren,2,Mon Jun 15 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"In addition to the cost, I can tell you that despite being Cuban himself, he would not be popular with the Cuban exiles down here."
letsgofish,39tird,Burquegreyhound,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"I would be happy with this for 2 reasons. 1 because it challenges mike Dunn in the bullpen to be better since he is our only lefty that has been decently reliable at best. 2nd because it stops the nationals from getting better. As long as we keep the margin close when Jose comes back July 2nd I can see us making a run in July, August for a playoff spot"

letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Sun Jun 14 19:51:07 2015 UTC,So can someone explain to me why Bryce Harper is getting this MVP hype when they keep showing Stanton's stats beating his. Most HRs in NL. Most RBIs in baseball. Etc. Is it just because team rankings?
letsgofish,39t0se,NdamukongSuh,3,Sun Jun 14 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"No, it's because he's been better so far this season. Harper = 62 runs created, 8 runs saved; Stanton = 47 runs created, 8 runs saved. Goldschmidt is going to overtake Harper soon though, and he is the true MVP imo."
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Stanton's slash line: .260/.344/.613  Harper's slash line: .343/.479/.725  Stanton is doing great, especially recently, but Harper is absolutely killing it."
letsgofish,39t0se,MiaCannons,3,Sun Jun 14 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"ESPN doesn't like the Marlins. We know this. They go with whats popular. Which is why they are going crazy over why the AL East sucks so much, when the NL East is MUCH MUCH worse, but the teams are less popular."
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Sun Jun 14 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"Well I heard he's been on fire. I think besides the HR and RBI stats Harper has him beat in every category, especially SO and BA. He always seems to get at least two hits a game some how.  (I don't know much about Harper, this is just what I'm hearing)"

letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Sun Jun 14 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"I like this a lot. And I think you are going to see Stanton enter the conversation again once his Avg goes up, because thats an important thing. /s  Do I think either of them is better than Goldschmidt? Fuck no. He has run away with it this year imo."
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 19:58:52 2015 UTC,I've heard that argument too. Buster Olney's podcast was comparing Goldschmidt and Harper the other day. And they said that Stanton MIGHT enter the convo when our pitchers come back cuz no one will pay attention if our team sucks.   But that's the main reason I bring this up. Is he getting ignored just because we suck. Understanding that the other 2 are doing amazing right now as well.
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Sun Jun 14 20:05:11 2015 UTC,"That may or may not be one of the baseball podcasts in my arsenal as well...  I think it's a little of the sucking factor, and also a little feast or famine . G seems to either hit a HR or strike out, this year mores than previously. I think once his BABIP goes back up (it's a career low at .290) we will start to see more doubles and hard singles. Which will help his slash line, and bring him into the conversation.  But that's just me."

letsgofish,39t0se,JL16,2,Sun Jun 14 19:38:15 2015 UTC,2 words. Heath Bell. Another 2. Carlos Marmol.
letsgofish,39t0se,Hurleybirdie,3,Sun Jun 14 19:44:21 2015 UTC,Jon Mabry?
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,8,Sun Jun 14 19:47:52 2015 UTC,Can't stress enough how bad Solano is. He should never leave the minors.....ever.
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,3,Sun Jun 14 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"If he was a pitcher, his BA wouldn't be that bad.."
letsgofish,39t0se,glassroc1,2,Sun Jun 14 19:36:50 2015 UTC,Nothing fancy Solano! Just get it in play  Nope.
letsgofish,39t0se,MrFancier,4,Sun Jun 14 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"Ichiro Career hit #4,593,900"
letsgofish,39t0se,Hurleybirdie,3,Sun Jun 14 19:34:49 2015 UTC,Don't worry. Solano will strike out
letsgofish,39t0se,Jollyman21,9,Sun Jun 14 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"I ain't even mad, Ichiro can get as many hits as he wants against us"
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,7,Sun Jun 14 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"Yep, can't ever be mad at an Ichiro hit."
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 19:33:40 2015 UTC,There's one back!!
letsgofish,39t0se,nekromantique,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:32:46 2015 UTC,Finally on the board! Ichiro!
letsgofish,39t0se,JL16,3,Sun Jun 14 19:32:45 2015 UTC,As weird as it feels...  You did good Steve.
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:22:02 2015 UTC,I feel bad...I don't want him closing anymore...but damn it I really want him back in the bullpen...so I hope he continues to pick his game up.
letsgofish,39t0se,Jollyman21,0,Sun Jun 14 22:23:15 2015 UTC,We've managed to drop de la Rosas era to a stunning 5.53
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 19:21:21 2015 UTC,Not bad. Coming in on bases loaded 1 out and only giving up 1.
letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,3,Sun Jun 14 19:20:21 2015 UTC,I'll take it
letsgofish,39t0se,destinybond,2,Sun Jun 14 19:25:03 2015 UTC,I'll take it. Especially for a first outing.
letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,2,Sun Jun 14 19:21:42 2015 UTC,/u/destinybond can I have a flair that says Sloth Whisperer?

letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,3,Sun Jun 14 23:29:09 2015 UTC,We should be able to make our own side text things.
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 19:19:21 2015 UTC,yassss
letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,3,Sun Jun 14 19:19:43 2015 UTC,Someone call 911. Cishek ran onto the field again.
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 19:14:50 2015 UTC,I dialed 9-1...now we wait.
letsgofish,39t0se,SirFailHard,3,Sun Jun 14 19:15:29 2015 UTC,DIAL THE 1
letsgofish,39t0se,Pimpinpinguino,2,Sun Jun 14 19:16:17 2015 UTC,Not yet. It's a non emergencey yet. We will see how CarGo goes.
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,3,Sun Jun 14 19:20:13 2015 UTC,Someone hold me.
letsgofish,39t0se,Pimpinpinguino,3,Sun Jun 14 19:12:28 2015 UTC,Not Cishek because he might drop you
letsgofish,39t0se,Jollyman21,3,Sun Jun 14 19:14:14 2015 UTC,Wait. Cishek? Really?  Drugs. I need drugs.
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,3,Sun Jun 14 19:12:13 2015 UTC,Dan Jennings is a masochist
letsgofish,39t0se,Jollyman21,6,Sun Jun 14 19:11:59 2015 UTC,What's good fish friends??  Also: dat sidebar O__o
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,5,Sun Jun 14 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"We are in a high pressure situation, losing, 3-0, bags loaded 1 out, and we pulled a pitcher to put in the guy who has single handedly cost us between 5-7 wins, for his first outing since coming back from the minors.... It's a little stressful up in this bitch."
letsgofish,39t0se,Jollyman21,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:13:36 2015 UTC,Son of a bitch. Ok I'm gonna turn the game on and cheer for you guys!
letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:24:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help! Got out of it with only 1 run scored!
letsgofish,39t0se,Jollyman21,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:26:56 2015 UTC,Decent!!
letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,4,Sun Jun 14 19:29:56 2015 UTC,You came back... I love you

letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,2,Sun Jun 14 19:28:45 2015 UTC,I really hope you guys smash the hell out of the Yankees in your upcoming series with them.
letsgofish,39t0se,JL16,2,Sun Jun 14 19:02:41 2015 UTC,Walked on 5 balls
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 18:56:53 2015 UTC,CMON BELARUS BEAT SPAIN!!
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,3,Sun Jun 14 18:48:53 2015 UTC,how do we not have any runs against this fucking guy!
letsgofish,39t0se,JL16,2,Sun Jun 14 18:48:24 2015 UTC,It's quiet in here. Too quiet for 2 teams to be in the same GDT....
letsgofish,39t0se,MrFancier,2,Sun Jun 14 18:42:53 2015 UTC,Prado with a right shoulder sprain. Day to Day.  Fuck.
letsgofish,39t0se,JL16,2,Sun Jun 14 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"Arenado should have been rung up, what a bs strike zone this has been"
letsgofish,39t0se,Pimpinpinguino,5,Sun Jun 14 18:16:18 2015 UTC,Nolan vs Marlins 3rd baseman today: 0-2
letsgofish,39t0se,beefat99,2,Sun Jun 14 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"Solano is so bad, why is he still in the majors?"
letsgofish,39t0se,stupidsexyrumham,2,Sun Jun 14 18:10:10 2015 UTC,Same reason Brad Hand is still in the majors
letsgofish,39t0se,AnOldHope,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:37:52 2015 UTC,A lack of someone better?
letsgofish,39t0se,UWannaBeHighForThis,6,Sun Jun 14 19:11:11 2015 UTC,Requesting a new side bar. Latos for a day is plenty whether good or not. Requesting this
letsgofish,39t0se,stupidsexyrumham,2,Sun Jun 14 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"No, I like current."
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Sun Jun 14 18:22:29 2015 UTC,I second this!
letsgofish,39t0se,destinybond,3,Sun Jun 14 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"So, we're getting this Marlins team today....WONDAFUL"
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 17:44:16 2015 UTC,Ozuna will pick up the slack. I believe!  Nope.
letsgofish,39t0se,rejz342,3,Sun Jun 14 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I get so hyped whenever he hits it hard"
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 17:39:24 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if Stanton sees anything near the plate.  EDIT: I am surprised. And disappointed.
letsgofish,39t0se,Hurleybirdie,2,Sun Jun 14 17:39:21 2015 UTC,Sort of a dick move by the Rockies 1B to still try and tag him when he's down and in pain
letsgofish,39t0se,JL16,9,Sun Jun 14 17:35:21 2015 UTC,Completely understandable though. I don't blame them.
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,4,Sun Jun 14 17:36:50 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree, but I think any 1B would do the same."
letsgofish,39t0se,destinybond,3,Sun Jun 14 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"god dammit now we have to see solano get at bats over DD just cause a lefty is on the mound, why not just play the better hitter???"
letsgofish,39t0se,JL16,3,Sun Jun 14 17:35:02 2015 UTC,I miss Don Kelly. This would be the perfect place for him.
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,2,Sun Jun 14 17:35:01 2015 UTC,Please be faking it
letsgofish,39t0se,destinybond,2,Sun Jun 14 17:33:02 2015 UTC,Gordon might be the worst baserunner for someone with his speed
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,3,Sun Jun 14 17:32:57 2015 UTC,Dee-sappointment.
letsgofish,39t0se,destinybond,2,Sun Jun 14 17:32:32 2015 UTC,Goddamn it
letsgofish,39t0se,bhopppp,3,Sun Jun 14 17:32:03 2015 UTC,I think i would be ok with an 11-9 slug fest today. That would be fun.
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,3,Sun Jun 14 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I have 4 in the Daily Dee. Better get started"
letsgofish,39t0se,rejz342,7,Sun Jun 14 17:28:09 2015 UTC,more runs in one inning than we've had the whole series!
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,3,Sun Jun 14 17:26:19 2015 UTC,I'm taking it as a sign that the ball is flying today. So that means our side will have the same kind of ABs. hopefully
letsgofish,39t0se,Hurleybirdie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that logic doesn't really apply to an indoor stadium."
letsgofish,39t0se,cmassick114,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"I was hoping the back windows were open. Our park is weird. When the windows are open but the roof is closed, the ball carries out more sometimes."
letsgofish,39t0se,rejz342,9,Sun Jun 14 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"Fun fact.  This is the first time we've had the lead in this series at any point.    Actually, that wasn't that fun."
letsgofish,39t0se,Hurleybirdie,5,Sun Jun 14 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"Very depressing, actually"
letsgofish,39t0se,Hurleybirdie,3,Sun Jun 14 17:27:21 2015 UTC,"Fucking Christ, Haren. Sweep isn't happening. Fucking 30 pitches in the first inning. He won't make it past the 4th..."
letsgofish,39t0se,iharland,3,Sun Jun 14 17:23:34 2015 UTC,It could still happen.  We do have De La Rosa pitching after all.
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,2,Sun Jun 14 17:26:42 2015 UTC,Oh hell yeah SHARKNADO!
letsgofish,39t0se,destinybond,6,Sun Jun 14 17:23:30 2015 UTC,Son of a bitch. Someone change the side pic to Jessica Haren... QUICK!!!
letsgofish,39t0se,cmassick114,2,Sun Jun 14 17:23:20 2015 UTC,2 HRs in the first... Not a good sign Haren.
letsgofish,39t0se,Design_with_Whiskey,3,Sun Jun 14 17:23:13 2015 UTC,Dan HRen is back
