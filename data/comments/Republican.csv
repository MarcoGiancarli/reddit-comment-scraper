They still consider us their primary geopolitical foe, and are still threatening to attack us and our allies.  In doing so, our elected officials, contrary to the rhetoric, not only failed to accomplish anything useful, but guaranteed a nuclear arms race (and a probable nuclear war) in the middle east, and set us up for huge terrorist attacks.  Given that, our elected officials should be impeached and prosecuted.  Whether a death sentence is warranted would depend on the charges and the jury."

(Now, he did say 'elected officials', but I don't who else he could be referring to.)   I realize that for an Obama hater criminal proceedings and a resulting execution is just part of the normal, everyday (overly emotional) thought process. But in my book it is hate speech."

People said the same sort of thing about Churchill after Chamberlain signed the Munich agreement in 1938.   Iran has been ""2 months"" from getting the bomb for like 55 years.    Ah, no.   now all of a sudden we have a deal and NOW they are going to get the bomb?   When we started with this, they had 193 centrifuges, now they have 19,000 - and they were caught buying prohibited nuclear technology again last month.   If they violate any part of the deal, the sanctions snap back into place.    No they don't.  Oh, theoretically on paper they do - but in practice they get 24 days notice before we are allowed to inspect their nuclear sites, so there won't be any violations by the time inspectors arrive.  Given that Iran has not ever abided by a nuclear agreement, I don't think any reasonable person believes they are going to start now.   There is no way they can create a bomb without us knowing in advance.   You mean like North Korea couldn't, under a much tighter regime of inspections, with a nuclear program that by treaty was supposed to have actually been dismantled?   We've just had those assets frozen so they couldn't touch them and they won't have access to them until they dismantle their nuke infrastructure.   The agreement doesn't require they dismantle it.   I'm sorry but we'll just have to disagree because i think this is a good deal for America. There is no way we could have gotten a better deal.   That is a ridiculous statement.   It's either this or boots on the ground...   That is not an either/or, any more than it was when Chamberlain signed the Munich agreement.

You have to look at his beliefs, too.  He seems to change with the wind.  http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/top-issues-on-which-trump-flip-flopped/  So ... no .... he is the one who has attacked first on a few occasions (and then when the person answers him, he hits back again) and he has not been consistently conservative... in fact, an approbation of universal health care ought to have us all saying, ""That guy may not be for us.""  No... you don't just give the nod to the guy who is the brashest and most contentious.  You give the nod to the one you can trust.

It remains to be seen what a race looks like now that candidates have more ways to fund their own campaigns, and a lack of donors is no longer necessarily the end of the road.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  Love,  People who just want to watch the world burn  P.S. Don't worry, Trump has said plenty of things on taxation, abortion, health care, eminent domain, bailouts (banks and auto industry), unions, free trade (Specifically the China part here), minimum wages, and I'm sure many more.  He won't make it through more than a few debates.  P.P.S. Don't bother debating me on the links I posted.  These are links to things that the GOP base or parts of it will find objectionable.  There are things in these links I find agreeable, and things in these links I find stupid, but I'm not posting them based on my personal opinion of them, so there's little point in arguing them with me.

You may not think much of the media's treatment of Trump, but that's what people see on their TVs and often carries more weight in terms of public perception of the GOP than anything.  A lot of people don't take the time to learn anything about either party's political platform anymore, and care more about the optics.  Obama slaughtered us in '08 for a lot of reasons, but a big one was paying attention to the show, the persona, presenting the idea of being the guy who was going to bring hope and change without actually putting down any substantive way he was going to do it.  He was cool, and presented a guy that made young people feel good about voting for him.  He was Bill Clinton playing saxophone on Arsenio all over again.  The longer the GOP takes to learn that lesson, the longer we'll just have to contend with a Democrat in the White House."

We couldn't tie everything we wanted to it or we would never get a deal.  Lots of countries have Americans locked up.  We still do business with them.  We should still work towards the release of those prisoners and this nuclear agreement may open the doors to better communication and facilitate the release at a later date.  But ultimately I think it's more valuable to stop the weapons program than it is to release four prisoners who should have never gone to Iran in the first place.

We couldn't tie everything we wanted to it or we would never get a deal.   Iran wanted negotiations because the sanctions were crippling them.  Just like the US strongarms Israel into releasing large numbers of terrorists from prison to get the Palestinians to the negotiating table, it could have made the release of the US captives in Iran a condition of beginning the talks.   We should still work towards the release of those prisoners and this nuclear agreement may open the doors to better communication and facilitate the release at a later date.   If he keeps to his same tactics, Obama may pay a ransom for them, but other than money, weapons and nuclear technology, we don't have anything Iran wants anymore - we gave it all away in exchange for nothing with this treaty.   But ultimately I think it's more valuable to stop the weapons program than it is to release four prisoners who should have never gone to Iran in the first place.   We could have done both.  Instead we did neither.   Heck, this deal is better than the eight years of mandated silence during the Bush administration. They got absolutely nothing done.

In the part where they didn't dismantle their existing nuclear weapons materials, aren't required to disclose what they've been doing, and require 24 days notice before we inspect military nuclear sites.  Oh, and where they were caught breaking the interim agreement last month, buying more prohibited tech.  All this agreement does is give them $150 billion and lift sanctions.   We ""could have"" done many more things, but this is what we have. It's progress. It's a start.   It is the same sort of progress that the far more restrictive agreement with North Korea was, that required they dismantle their nuclear weapons program (something the Iranian agreement does not do), which resulted in a North Korean nuclear weapons test a little while later.  Iran has not ever abided by a nuclear treaty, and it is not going to start now.  As Churchill once put it, “You were given the choice between war and dishonor.

I think there are cheap and reasonable things we could change in our educational system to empower students to make more rational decisions and make society a more free and productive place.  The main thing I see wrong with the system is we don't empower and inform our youth to make rational decisions early enough in their lives. We don't teach people to think economically and strategically about their future or how to maximize their value as a member of the workforce. By the time people have gotten far enough in the world to figure out that they NEED to think like this (maybe the art major was a bad idea) it is difficult to alter their life course.

Either they were adults then and need to take responsibility for their actions, or they were not.  If they were not, then we need to change the age at which we consider people to be adults and responsible for their actions.  Maybe we should make it age 26, as Obamacare considers children to be dependent until that age.

By extension, as adults, they are responsible for paying back the money they borrowed. Either they were adults then and need to take responsibility for their actions, or they were not.   To deal in such absolutes is to miss the issue at hand. These outgoing students had no basis to determine whether their potential career would have value in the future--and by no basis I mean parents not knowledgeable enough to guide them. So it wasn't really their responsibility, and it is unfair to think otherwise. Something must be done to help these poor students in their ignorance, but, more importantly, in their parents' ignorance."

The issue isn't about age for adulthood, that doesn't fix student debt.   That is exactly what it is about.  Either the students with the debt were responsible when they signed for it, or they are children who cannot be entrusted with adult decisions and need to have those responsibilities taken out of their hands and made for them by responsible people.

To commemorate the creation of this new organization, the KKK funded the initial commission of the carving in the article. The site had financial trouble mainly due to both world wars and the depression.  In 1958, it was bought by the state government and completed, mainly as an FU to blacks during the growing civil rights movement.   So, the NAACP cares because it's an intentionally and overtly racist monument to the KKK, and state owned to boot.

Then I would end the war on marijuana, try to pass some form of bill that takes it off the DEA's shit list then promote forms of legalization/medicinal/decriminalization across all 50 states and out laying territory.   I think the biggest thing is I would not support amnesty for everyone that is already here. I understand that it might be the easy way out, but Rome wasn't built in a day.

I would rate that close to extreme, but I agree that it would be the best most efficient and effective method to combat illegal immigration and significantly reduce illegal intake.   How do you justify such an extreme action, however? Why wouldn't you support amnesty? This would be a massive waste of money for no reason. It's not the easy way out, you just pardon them and they get on with their lives.  I plan to do some more research into the economic impacts, but from my initial look at Wikipedia (which perhaps has a socialist-bias), the economic impact of illegal immigrants is apparently beneficial.  When they are forced to legally immigrate, does the country get the choice to accept them or not? Okay, so let's consider a USA where no illegal immigrants can get in, how do you decide whether an immigrant can get in or not? Maybe all of these immigrants won't be like the hard-working laborers the US needs? Rather, they are privileged individuals who have been funded by their families just to get in--and the economy of these countries gets worse as these families work so hard to get all the money they can gather just to get the certification that they can enter the US. Immigration would just become a commodity for the government to make more money off.  Maybe instead of putting all that money into blocking illegal immigration, subsidize legal immigration. I don't know how you would do that but turn it into a positive. If the US isn't actually selective about who it allows in, apart from ensuring they have credentials, why can't it just subsidize legal immigration?"

I would give all illegal immigrants 90 days' notice that they need to evacuate the nation and that if they are captured after that 90 days, they will lose any right to ever become a citizen.   Okay, so let's consider a USA where no illegal immigrants can get in, how do you decide whether an immigrant can get in or not?    We have rules and a process.  There are a few different ways that someone can live here and seek citizenship.   Rather, they are privileged individuals who have been funded by their families just to get in--and the economy of these countries gets worse as these families work so hard to get all the money they can gather just to get the certification that they can enter the US. Immigration would just become a commodity for the government to make more money off.   This is not how it works, but as it stands now ... many illegals work here and send millions if not billions back to families in their home countries.   Why wouldn't you support amnesty?   Because it has been done a number of times already.  It does not work.  All it does is provide a reason for people to come here illegally.  They figure that if they can get here, eventually we will make them citizens.  Because that is what we do.  We have a welfare state.  It is incompatible with open borders.  In 2006, I believe, we accepted more legal immigrants than all other nations combined.  It is only reasonable for a nation to control the number of people entering it.  It is only right to see that people do it the correct way.  Granting a mass amnesty spits in the face of all of the people who did things the right way."

We should not be so heartless as to fail to accept kids of foreign nationals who were brought here illegally against their will....  America is the only home they have ever known....  etc....etc....  Do we honestly believe that the recent surge of people over the Southern border included people with kids or kids without parents who got here using coyotes or with help from the Mexican government and it had nothing to do with the fact that people are promoting the idea that kids brought here should get citizenship?

Republican,3d2eaf,IBiteYou,5,Mon Jul 13 23:58:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer. =) I guess name recognition is a big thing, thinking about it now. I was watching Fox News a few weeks back, and they went around showing random people in New York photos of the people running, and I think nearly everyone got Donald Trump, most people got Hillary Clinton and a couple of them got Jeb Bush. I might be a bit wrong on that, but as far as I remember, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were the two most recognizable. I guess even if you aren't a fan of them, you're more likely to support the guy you know over the guy you don't. =)"
Republican,3d2eaf,atomic1fire,6,Mon Jul 13 02:24:08 2015 UTC,"On that note, I personally see some of the democratic policies as conflicting with an open border policy that democrats are not quite but almost reaching for.  I don't think you can have a welfare system if you're inviting more poor people then the number of people paying for the welfare system in the first place.  Minimum wage laws won't work if there's already an illegal population willing to work under the table.  Things like gun control or drug laws aren't quite effective if the borders are so insecure that the government can just lose guns in mexico or people smuggle drugs here. (edit: and on that note, who's to say that they can't smuggle guns back into the country. Buying guns from say russia and importing them into a no gun zone like chicago has gotta be a nice little import business.)  People who are supposed to be deported, end up just staying here, sometimes committing other crimes in the process. But since the government doesn't actually know about every person who walks across the border, you can't feasibly do background checks."

Too many are currently treating it like a non-issue and if you even touch it you're a racist.

He won't win or even last very long, but people like him because he's speaking the truth on issues like illegal immigration.   At my previous address in Nebraska, I had to do a sociology paper where I noticed that 30% of all elementary school students in Nebraska only spoke Spanish and not English. Keep in mind that this is Nebraska, not Texas or Florida. Illegal immigration is a huge problem, but no one can really talk about it for fear of losing the hispanic vote, which often determines the winner of presidential elections. Not to mention being decried by the media as racist, e.g. Trump."

His name recognition is off the charts. He appeals to the average voter (old, white, etc.) by being anti-PC & forcing others to respond. Another popular view (at least here in Texas) is that he can't be bought off by donations.   At best, he'll pull a Rick Perry & figure out how to speak to the masses.

Anti-immigration? We have lots of that, but it's not the ideas that I'm wondering about. Ted Cruz is anti-immigration, afaik, but he's been a politician before, which means at least he can act on those ideas properly- surely a few years in politics means he knows how to debate ideas and convince people to go with what he's saying. That's the bit that's getting me- what is Trump actually going to be able to DO about immigration?  I'm not living over there, I have no idea of levels of Trump support on the ground, if you get me. I'm seeing his face all over news sites and forums and everything else, but I don't know if he's just got more visible support because he's a celebrity, or if he genuinely has the level of support I'm seeing.  But what you're saying is it's targeting the anti-immigrant sentiment that's making him popular? Is there anyone else questioning his non-political background, or is that seen as irrelevant. Our system is fairly different in my country, so I can't really compare it to that.

Your question was legitimate and presented well, his response was frankly quite rude. Not to mention, it seems you have an actual desire to learn about this, seeing as you've been replying to pretty much everyone here with constructive statements/questions.  I followed Trump before he began running for president because he's kind of a funny guy the way he does things. That being said, I probably wouldn't ever want to work with him professionally or politically, and when he started his run for presidency I figured he wouldn't get much support and it would just be another person to make the GOP race look like a circus. I had the same question as you when he started to gain a substantial following, as did many other Republicans, but in reality it's a little unclear. There's countless news articles all over the place trying to figure it out too, but I think the general understanding is that it's his bluntness and political-outsider-ness.  (I would also add to this long comment that I think most Americans aren't too fond of our two party system in the first place. It's too easy for people to just pick a party and vote only for that party, never understanding the representatives or the issues. This may also play into Trump's popularity; he's kind of a celebrity figure here so Republicans who are already looking for that ""R"" next to a name might as well pick a name they know.

Above all, it's important to understand that every single person I've talked to on this, every researcher interviewed- we all want to be wrong. If we had definitive evidence that CO2 emissions really aren't having an effect on our climate, we'd be dancing in the streets and buying gigantic SUV's.   Well then you're getting your wishes - because the CO2 based models don't work and never have."
Republican,3d0kgl,keypuncher,5,Mon Jul 13 04:51:44 2015 UTC,"This brings me back to my original statement:  the right has chosen to side with unreliable, disingenuous ""research"" that the scientific community has brushed aside.  Your climate model statement is based off of running climate models without taking volcanic eruptions and El Niño into account.  Once those variables were plugged into the models, they worked quite well.  I honestly don't know why I'm even bothering to mention this because this was known years ago.    If you insist that a climate model must work even if all data points aren't accounted for, then you have created an unrealistic expectation.   From a scientific standpoint, looking at this argument vs the consensus, it's not even close.  Am I expected to accept that the climate models are bad because a group decided to withhold important climatic data points entered into the model?"
Republican,3d0kgl,WillieM96,-5,Mon Jul 13 15:23:15 2015 UTC,Your climate model statement is based off of running climate models without taking volcanic eruptions and El Niño into account.

Republican,3d0kgl,keypuncher,4,Mon Jul 13 15:26:09 2015 UTC,"If you have yet to see any good models, then you're not looking.    The last ten years have been an embarrassment for me as a conservative and a man of science.  Conservatism should not have to rely on science denial.  We'd all love a simple and pure line of evidence but science doesn't work that way.  It's very nuanced and you have to understand what results mean on their own and within the context of the larger body of data out there.  Factoring competing results and principals is hard work.   Both political parties want all the data to go their way but science doesn't work like that.  Nature doesn't care about political values.   Anchoring political position to bad science will be the undoing of this party (although the antivaxination movement still has the potential to be an albatross for the left).  I can't stand by and support a candidate or a party who blatantly disregards the experts in the field who have good support from the entire scientific community.  I'm not a climate expert.  I'm not an expert in most sciences but I do know how to find the experts and identify pseudoscience (an argument that relies on a massive intergovernmental conspiracy against your position is usually a bad sign).   Our political policies and opinions should be informed by good, legitimate science.  As long as that foundation is strong, the opinions can at least be debated intelligently."

The numbers used are for federal prisons but all the crimes they mention would put someone in a state prison. In both mentions in the article about prison populations, they're referring to federal prisons exclusively, not state prisons.   illegal aliens constitute 27% of the federal prison population (3).  The percentage of all federal prisoners who are criminal aliens has remained the same over the last 3 years--about 27 percent.   Federal prison is where you go for being an illegal immigrant. It's also where you'd go for transporting drugs into the country or across state lines.  Murder is both a federal and a state crime, but I just started going through their list of ""a selection of Crimes Committed against Americans by Illegals"" and as near as I can tell every one of those people convicted ended up in state prisons.  So what are the numbers for states prisons, where the criminals they reference actually are, and why didn't bring them up in the article???  I'd bet money that the illegal immigrants in federal prisons are mostly there for being illegal immigrants or drug trafficking (which is something the US is trending toward getting rid of as a serious crime as states legalize drugs). I'd also be willing to bet that the ""savage"" illegal immigrants all went to state prisons where they're a drop in the bucket compared to the numbers of regular US citizens in there for similar offenses."

In both mentions in the article about prison populations, they're referring to federal prisons exclusively, not state prisons.   ...and if the offenders commit crimes that are also Federal violations, they can end up in a Federal prison.   Federal prison is where you go for being an illegal immigrant. It's also where you'd go for transporting drugs into the country or across state lines.   The article is discussing felons only - and illegal immigration is a felony only if an illegal immigrant has been previously charged and convicted of unlawful entry, been deported, and is then caught in the US and charged with and convicted of unlawful entry a second time.  The catch is that illegals are almost never charged with unlawful entry.  Normally illegals are charged with unlawful presence, which is a civil violation the only penalty for which is being sent back to their country of origin).   So what are the numbers for states prisons, where the criminals they reference actually are, and why didn't bring them up in the article???   They don't bring them up because the states aren't required to report them - so many states don't.  That said, this may shed some light on it.  According to this report, about 9% of violent repeat offenders and 30% of violent first offenders in Arizona prisons in 2010, were foreign nationals.  According to the data there, 98-99% of those are illegal aliens - those numbers are far, far above the representation of illegal aliens in the population.

Republican,3cu2u2,Pavegecko,3,Fri Jul 10 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"I turned to my roommate on this one. He is a substitute teacher. He is not in a union but he is in the field of teaching. He has actually caught and gotten a teacher fired for grade fixing, indeed, unfortunately it does happen. On the subject of unions, he has this to say:  It's not the union's job to hold the teachers accountable for their actions. Their paid job is not to investigate teachers, it's simply not their job description, it's not their specialization, it's not what they functionally do. It should be up to investigators and inspectors to make sure that teachers are doing their jobs properly.  When a teacher is actually being held accountable for grade fixing, it's actually our court system's job to handle it and provide prosecution. The union is paid to be the voice for the other side of the conflict. You guys know that a union is essentially a group of lawyers that defend the rights of the teachers that pay them, much like a defense attorney defends their clients. Basically, even if the school's teachers are caught price fixing, the union serves as a team of representatives to make a case for their clients and to help them have leverage in determining their punishment.  This is one of the things that unions do, and it's entirely how defense attorneys work. The fact that the lawyers of this union will do their job (that they were paid to do) in this matter of a legal conflict is not really sufficient reason to get rid of them. If we do that, then we have to find an alternative legal voice for the teachers, one that could be unreliable for a fair trial to happen. It shouldn't be thought of as a negative quality, it's simply part of the legal process, it's part of what the union is paid to do.  Furthermore, given how many benefits teacher unions end up providing to the schools, it ends up being an overall positive thing to have school unions.  Personally, I am okay with teacher unions, because teacher unions for example help ensure that they have the sufficient equipment to teach kids, which means that you as a parent end up not having a huge shopping list of things to buy for your kid before they start learning. I lived in Texas where teacher unions (or unions of any kind) are more rare, and not only does it have among the worst performance rates of the country, but the parents spend a ludicrous amount of money on school supplies because the district administrations (not the teachers) are pushing the burden of supplying their operational needs onto parents, so sucks to be a poor parent in Texas!  If there's anything useful we should do with tax income, the wisest thing to do is heavily invest in education, full stop. Fighting unions is just going to make things harder for poor parents who can't afford to pay for supplies a union would demand the school board provide.  I have almost no idea what exactly the writer of this article was trying to even get at, but it seems like he doesn't fully grasp the purpose of a teacher union, and seems to blame things like grade fixing on them, when really, teacher unions cannot prevent that kind of thing from happening or control it. They're lawyers for legal conflicts, not inspectors. The wisest option for the Republican Party would be to focus on introducing inspectors to find out if teachers are grade fixing, not fight with unions."
Republican,3cu2u2,ohmsnap,3,Sun Jul 12 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't even unions. That's what happens when funding is tied to standardized testing metrics. Grades get fudged, tests and curricula  get dumbed down so the schools can get the funding they need."
Republican,3cu2u2,-Pasha-,2,Sun Jul 12 09:44:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, here. We need to get students to master these basic concepts and move on to more of the specialized topics, which requires quite a lot of rethinking regarding the system in general.  I say we need to tie funding to how well the collective student body performs on a custom specialized test for each student based on what courses they took. Art students should be tested on art history, math students should get the Calculus problems, etc. It would be easier to pinpoint exactly where teachers need to be replaced and funding needs to be increased. Standardized testing doesn't give us detailed information about the schools, but specialized testing (with some standards, of course) would be better for more appropriately assessing a school's ability to teach."
Republican,3cu2u2,ohmsnap,2,Sun Jul 12 12:22:59 2015 UTC,"I think that having a specialized education from k-12 would be a mistake.  High school graduates should have a reasonable amount of knowledge on a very wide range of subjects so that they have the most flexibility with what they want to do after high school(when they become adults).   That being said...the current battery of standardized tests is crap and needs to be fixed.  But, a 'good' standardized test is incredibly difficult because student populations across the country are so different, and even within a single student population, the variety of individuals is staggering.  To try to take into account the many different ways people learn, express, and demonstrate knowledge is a colossal undertaking"

While this can be a touchy subject between states rights/federal power, this is not one of those subjects.   If you are here illegally, you are breaking federal law. If you are a sanctuary city and you refuse to turn over detained illegal immigrants to federal authorities, then you are also breaking the law.   It's really not that difficult."

Republican,3clge2,jimmyscrackncorn,3,Fri Jul 10 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I have a Bachelors in Political Science.  Polling the general population at large regarding who they'd vote for is not useful, unless the results make your candidate look good.  Why?  Well because plenty of the general population doesn't vote, these people who don't vote typically don't share the same opinions on political matters as people who do vote.  Even if they did, they're not voting so it doesn't matter. Which is why you pay more attention to 'likely voters'.    Next up, swing voters.  Why do we care about them more than the likely Democrat or Republican voters?  Well for one, during a Presidential election turn out is fairly high, so we don't generally worry about low turn out.  We assume it's going to be high turn out.  This is important because that means most of the likely Democrat and Republican voters will go out to vote, and consistently vote for their team.  We don't worry about them because their voting patterns are a known quantity. So roughly you have about 40% of the likely voters going for Democrats and 40% going for Republicans.  That's a wash.  That leaves 20%, these people are the likely voters who are swing voters, they hold no allegiance and vote for either party.  This is actually where we get the term swing state, because the likely voters in those states for either party are so close in numbers that they cancel each other out, the swing voters hold the power.  This is a very simplified breakdown, and there are other factors involved and of course the 40-40-20 rule is not absolute, turn out could be unexpectedly lopsided, maybe you have your first Latino president, etc.  However in general this is how it has played out.  Which is why you always see after the primaries people focusing on 'swing voters' or 'moving to the middle'.  That's how you win an election.  You only pay attention to the base to make sure they show up so that you can have parity with the opposing party and cancel their votes out leaving the swing voters up for grabs.  In closing if you succeed in getting your base out, that is step one,  during a presidential election this is less important because there is high turn out anyway.  You still try though.  The next step is getting the swing vote.  If you loose them it doesn't matter how much you bring out the base, you will still loose.    I hope that helped."

Republican,3cdojh,DUIguy87,3,Tue Jul 7 22:45:18 2015 UTC,"Many places, once the ACA came into full swing, dialed back all their part time employes weekly hours to ensure that their part time workers wouldn't suddenly get the full benefits package as full timers due to budget constraints.  So what do you think will happen once a $15/hr hike minimum wage kicks in?  Nobody in a minimum wage job will get any employer benefits of any kind, because nobody in a minimum wage job will ever work anything more than part time.  So no more vacation, less sick time, and no health insurance through the employer.  Then there is a risk of outsourceing/replacing the workers.  Do you think it would be a stretch to have a customer at a fast food joint ring in their own order, or have a drive through call a location overseas instead of an in store worker?  If it keeps the dollar menu closer to a dollar, you are damn right companies will.  And then eventual increase in prices will directly hit the lower middle class, and start eating away at whats left of our middle class.  Why?  Likely the first items to be affected would be food stuffs with a minimal profit margin as is.  Produce, meats and all manner of unprepared foods.  The basic things that everybody needs.  I will give you this though: IF an increase in minimum wage is necessary it needs to be pre planned and gradual to allow the markets to adjust over time, not an overnight 100% mark up."

The other candidates are perceived as dodging an issue that is VERY important to conservatives.  Illegal immigration is a very large problem.  We are not only not addressing it, we are encouraging it.  All of the other candidates should be learning from the Trump bump over this.   Mexico's government is a problem.  They have been caught assisting people to get through their country in order to get into the USA illegally.  They have tougher immigration rules than ours...yet they dare to criticize us for wanting to enforce our own laws.  Trump is getting this support because he talks about the issue.  The others ought to take note and quit being scared of the amnesty folks."
Republican,3ch22z,IBiteYou,2,Tue Jul 7 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"I personally feel his rhetoric is too polarizing though.  I am against amnesty and illegal immigration, and we need to find a better way of vocalizing this than what can be, and is by many, seen as overt racism.  Many of the legal immigrants I've meet are against illegal immigration as well since they don't like the idea that someone gets to jump the line, get to the same place, and have minimal repercussions.  I think if they had a more clearcut message that didn't make the legal immigrants feel threatened, but still draw a clear line in the sand about immigration, a candidate would be able to appeal to the core party while still pulling new people in."
Republican,3ch22z,DUIguy87,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:35:41 2015 UTC,I think if they had a more clearcut message that didn't make the legal immigrants feel threatened...   No legal immigrants should feel threatened about a candidate making a clear-cut case against illegal immigration.  The Democrats do not want to enforce immigration law.  They like endless amnesties because these immigrants tend to vote for democrats.  It is literally a case of hating the law because the people the illegality benefits are going to vote for you.  It is time for our candidates to say no more amnesties and to call Democrats on the carpet for this terrible behavior.

Republican,3ch22z,pcopley,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:17:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If what I've seen in commercials is true about how great Mexico is, their economy, innovation and how they're growing as a nation, then why the hell can't these people stay there and work on making their own country a better place, rather than come here and bring all their baggage with them: the cartels, drugs, violent criminals, welfare cases, etc.   We used to have a policy on immigration where we only allowed outsiders in if there was a need for them, like they had a skill in demand or something. They had to prove their worth and commitment to the country and they would be granted citizenship as a reward. When there was no more need for immigrants for a while, we could pretty much say ""beat it, country's full"" and outsiders would have to wait. We don't do that now. Instead we take literally what some damn Frenchman wrote on the statue of liberty about ""huddled masses"". That little inscription is not a law or an immigration policy people. We are not the welfare state of the world when people have problems where they're from. Stay there and fix your own problems. Stop running away from them because your problems will only follow you."

People from every nation in Central and South America come over our southern border.   Second, You seem to attribute the existence of cartels and drugs to Mexicans. These things wouldn't exist without the voracious appetite for such substances that exists in the United States.   People come to the US for a variety of reasons, some of which are extremely nuanced.

Republican,3cdcp3,SouthernCharm1856,3,Tue Jul 7 05:58:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I totally agree on many of those points. Much of the reason we want to put Hillary into office is so that we as Democrats can maintain divided government because it is very clear the legislature is about to take a Republican swing for a few years. Also, it appears that a few Supreme Court Justices are about to pass away so having a Democratic President in the next 8 years could be a big judicial move, potentially leading to almost certainly 1, but probably 2 appointees.  Regardless, I share your sentiment that Hillary is not the best candidate.

The only reason she gets away with it is because the American press has got her back. Look at how the press treated Chris Christie. He closes a bridge and they crucify him. Hillary actually breaks the law and not a pep.  Bernie Sanders is a Socialist not a Liberal. There is a difference. A Liberal believe in equal opportunity. Socialist believe in equality of outcome. Good liberals believe in helping the poor. Socialist want to punish the rich. Liberals want to make the free market work better according to Liberal values.

That said, this does blow out of the water the claim that Obama and Hillary didn't know the attack was Al Qaeda, pre-planned, and had nothing to do with the youtube video when they spent a week and a half lying to the American public that it was a spontaneous demonstration in response to the video.  [Edit: Incidentally, it also blows a giant hole in the arguments of the people who say that nothing was found in all the Congressional investigations of Benghazi - because these documents were required to have been provided to those Congressional investigations and were not. Nor were the Hillary emails now surfacing that she and the White House and the State Department claimed didn't exist.

The particular type (501c3, named for the section in the tax code) limits the political activities of the groups that qualify.  I'm not sure if there are other ""brands"" of non-profits who have greater political advocacy rights, or what the tax treatment of advocacy groups would be.  Basically, I doubt there is anything prohibiting setting up two separate entities, one of which is a church and one of which is a political action committee.  The thing is that only donations explicitly collected for political activities (i.e. by the PAC) can be used for political activities.  The church offering can't be used for political activities.  The two entities will also be treated differently for tax purposes."

All from a court case from 1819.   The case, called McCulloch v Maryland, was the State of Maryland attempting to tax the Bank of the United States. Chief Justice John Marshall handed down his decision with the following: ""The power to tax involves the power to destroy.""   While this ruling in particular pertained to states not being able to tax federal government entities, I believe this can be extrapolated to relate to pretty much anything that is protected from the federal government.   According to the United States Constitution, Amendment I, ""...Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of a religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...""  By taxing churches, the federal government now has the power to destroy churches. This is, I do believe, a law respecting an establishment of a religion, and kind of prohibiting the free exercise of religion."

Might as well have gay and straight water fountains.   Correct, not every state has the same definition of marriage. But determining that banning people from the advantages and protections of marriage is unconstitutional, which is within the of SCOTUS role in our government.   I firmly believe in states rights, but if something is ruled unconstitutional it is no longer enforceable by a state that is a member of our nation."

In that regard, if someone claims that they believe something is 50-50, then asking them to make a small wager with slightly better odds is a good way of testing that. Generally, I then followup by actually asking if they want to make the bet.  In this case, I agree with you that /u/Wannabe2good probably doesn't deep down inside actually believe his claim in question, and that's reflected in the fact that he didn't respond to my bet offer at all.

Republican,3b8he6,WillieM96,2,Sat Jun 27 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"There might be a liberal bias in academia but I don't think the bias in scientific research is as strong as you believe.  Occasionally, you'll see a psychological study come through that bashes republicans but most of them are not taken seriously because other scientists can easily hone in on their bias.  If they truly are biased, you can see it in the design of their experiment in most cases and the scientific community will trounce on it.  It's not just the conservatives that get their panties in a bunch over research, either.  Several years ago there was a study that indicated that there is an inherent preference in women against engineering.  It's real- it's not saying women can't be good engineers.  It's merely stating that there does seem to be a difference in the neurological wiring between men and women that makes engineering in its current form unappealing to women.  A Harvard President got fired for merely mentioning this as one of the lines of evidence that needs to be studied when trying to figure out why there aren't as many women engineers as men.  The liberals got all sorts of butt hurt over the statement and it was a perfectly rational, scientific statement.  In research (and politics), it is important to understand that science is merely a method of inquiry.  A majority of the time, when someone gets fired from a research institution or they lose funding, it's because their methods are flawed or they simply aren't producing any meaningful data."
Republican,3b8he6,Credulous7,0,Sat Jun 27 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"I think you're downplaying the fact that scientists get to choose their own research paths, and therefore even though the methods of studies are unbiased and result in a ""fact"" (at best), most of the ""facts"" that are researchers discover will be biased in one direction or the other. Basically the light never gets shown on the other side.  If you don't believe me, here are 10 studies along the lines of what I was talking about:  Conservatives report, but liberals display, greater happiness   Science is an extremely prestigious journal  Why Liberals and athiests are more intelligent  Conservatives react more strongly trolling  Lower IQ people are more racist and conservative  Conservatives are more racist because they identify faces as black quicker  Liberals live longer than conservatives  Conservatives have higher negativity bias  Conservatives are more habitual, don't change their response as much to given evidence  This was one google search away. It's much harder to find papers going the other way. I would say the liberal bias in academia is ""strong enough"" and I wouldn't put too much faith in other scientists' motivation to ""hone in on their bias"", as that would risk alienation."
Republican,3b8he6,WillieM96,2,Fri Jun 26 22:37:47 2015 UTC,There's a couple of legitimate studies in there but most of those are sensationalist bullshit that no scientist would take seriously.  The entire field of psychology is going through a transition right now as the light is being shined on the number of poor quality studies that are getting published.  The people doing legitimate psychological studies don't give a crap about politics or political affiliation.  Most scientists I know hate politics and want nothing to do with it- except when their budgets get cut or their work gets unfairly attacked or distorted.
Republican,3b8he6,Credulous7,0,Sat Jun 27 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"Again, they're legitimate enough to get published in Science and Nature, so they are scientifically ""confirmed"", and that's not even that relevant because as long as a study is published, period, that's enough for some idiot to point at it and say ""see, science is on my side"".   And I don't quite understand what your argument is, are you trying to say scientists aren't biased to the left?"
Republican,3b8he6,WillieM96,2,Sun Jun 28 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"I'm saying their bias to the left has been heavily influenced by the battles they have had to fight with the right.  All (good) scientists are doing is posing questions about nature and trying to answer them.  When they reach a result, they face unfounded criticism from the right WAY more often.  First it's, ""you're wrong because this my threaten my industry"" and as soon as the opportunity comes up, the republicans try to cut funding for their research.  The proposed cuts to NASA's earth science research is the perfect example of this.  It's the republican congress trying to halt climate change research."

Republican,3b63mn,KevanPrine,12,Fri Jun 26 07:24:50 2015 UTC,"I think Obamacare needs to be reformed rather than removed. Many of us in the labor industry are now stuck on high deductible HSA accounts, I'm paying a little more for substantially worse coverage than I had pre-Obamacare. And I get why, and HSA set up allows the insurance company to save money on my care as I am paying into the system freeing up more money for them to insure the people who don't pay.   The issue here is now: 1) I am at a much higher risk of injury than someone who is not working/not in a labor feild and 2) due to wear and tear on my body from 65+ hours of labor a week I have complications that are not covered by workmans comp (as they are not an ""on the job"" injury). Not to mention if I were to get into a car accident on my way home and require a trip to the emergency room, I'll be right up on my $2,500 deductible, fry my HSA, plus a portion of my savings and now be out of work in an hourly position. Well shit, now I can't make mortgage payments, utility payments, tool payments, and car payments at least until my disability kicks in and I better damn well hope that I get laid off too because disability alone won't cover all my bills.   I have no reason to believe if Obamacare is shot down that my coverage will go back to the way it was before, the HSA structure is just too profitable for insurance companies.  A full repeal will do little to help those of us already negatively effected by the law.   We need a provision that makes it affordable for labor workers, and other high risk fields to have a full comprehensive coverage.  We need a way on genuinely ensuring that health care costs not only stop climbing, but drop to more affordable levels regardless of what direction insurance plans go.  We are supposed to be the responsible party here, and what better way to do that than taking the democratic ""success"" of the decade and fixing it?"
Republican,3b63mn,DUIguy87,8,Fri Jun 26 13:58:35 2015 UTC,"Our healthcare system needs fixing that's without a question. My concern with the right is that their politican's don't seem interested in doing anything to fix it. Meanwhile Obamacare didn't really fix anything. The problem is that medical expenses in this country are simply too high. Human beings in the year 2015 shouldn't have to make decisions between, going to the hospital or not, taking an ambulance, getting a checkup, and their financial well being.  Our healthcare costs in this  country are massively higher than any other 1st world country. The claims that we get better treatment, or access to better care simply aren't real. In Canada or England we always hear the myth ""but you go to the hospital and get a lottery ticket and if you need treatment your gonna have to wait!!!"" but literally every single canadian or englishmen I have questioned about this, says that they absolutely LOVE their system, and haven't had issues with it. Meanwhile when they come to the US they have to be constantly on edge because if they got injured, they would have to do what we do, and weigh out the costs vs benefits of getting medical help. Its fucking insanity and a travesty in this country. I don't care if healthcare is subsidized by tax payers or not, that doesn't matter, what matters is that people are going bankrupt for treatment, or they don't get treatment because they don't want to go bankrupt.

Republican,3b63mn,Trodamus,8,Fri Jun 26 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"I worked as a benefits coordinator years before the ACA came to pass.  I assisted employees at a high profit tech company and a low-income service company.  Both sets of plans were moving away from HMO / PPO options and onto HSAs with most preventative care covered 100%. Again, prior to the ACA coming about.  I think the ACA popularized this sort of plan because it really moves the burden back onto the employee and makes them manage a sort of mini-insurance of their own (with the rollover account). Most people don't realize preventative stuff is covered and just stay away from the doctor for years and years.  Which obviously means nothing if you have an actual injury.  Ideally the 80/20 provision will even this out in a few years, but I kind of doubt it.   But I just wanted to say that the ACA isn't quite responsible for this, though it played a part in making it much more widely spread and quickly adopted.  Employers liked this plan a ton before the ACA."

I've been hiked up an extra $120/mo with the HSA from my previous co-pay plan since ACA got into full swing. My company made it clear that this was not a route they wanted to go down, since they want their workers at full capacity at all times.  And they have always been very transparent with the cost of the plans, so I really don't have any reason to doubt them on it.  As for the 80/20 rule...  It touts a $1.1 Billion savings for americans since 2012, which is what?  Roughly $2 a piece spread across the population over a two year period?  I'll have to agree, I'm doubting it too."

Alternative fuel sources are becoming more and more viable for peak sunlight and wind hours on the grid.  Storage is still a long ways away.  Fossil fuels will be needed until you can efficiently store sunlight from peak hours.  Right now solar is competitive with fossil fuels:  but only for a few hours of the day.  Outside of those peak hours it is not at all competitive and has a really long way to go to becoming cost effective to provide the energy (and pay for storage) for a 24h coverage window.  To a third world country, it is just not feasible to provide 24h coverage that costs far more.  They can have limited coverage for a few hours a day quite nicely now - but 24h coverage is not feasible for them unless they burn fossil fuels.  For example:  one might need a solar facility capable of generating 3 gigawatts at peak hours to provide the same 24h power generation as a coal facility of 1 gigawatt  solar though:  it is a godsend in hot climates where peak power load aligns almost perfectly with the top hours for solar generation and in those countries it will be far easier to adapt into their economies then a country like Russia (where hydro and wind would need to be used far more)."

So aside from social issues they want to cut it's head off and I don't think that is attractive to people who might be considering switching parties. Why flock to a party that is actually trying to remove government's ability to do it's job. No EPA,no education, no welfare, no consumer or environment protection, no social security, no medicaid....  I think the party needs to be worried about the growing portion of conservative politicians who are waging a sort-of war against government. Aren't there some who are trying to starve the beast and try to make government useless? They want small government that is so small it can fit in a bathtub and be drowned. Rand Paul signed Grover Norquist's pledge that says he agrees to never under any circumstances raise taxes.

I think on some level, that stuff is attractive to some people, but the problem is that the majority of the Tea Party folks were not thinking about the possible negative implications of that stuff going down.    Like the no EPA for instance.  Several years ago, alot of those folks were calling for that and claiming that it was holding back our economy and siting China as a wonderful example of a wonderfully growing economy that was not hampered by an EPA.  Well, a couple of years of that, and no one in China could breathe anymore (remember all the pictures posted about the air in China?).  There are honestly instances where the EPA is a bit too controlling, but the solution isn't to ditch the whole thing.    -----Oh, we also had those coal ash spills in West Virginia that made the water undrinkable.     -----So the Kill the EPA has quietly dropped off the agenda for most GOP folks and even the Tea Party people.  Privatizing Social Security seems cool and was promoted by even mainstream GOP folks until the recession.  Even when they invested responsibly, a lot of people lost a ton of money when the economy tanked.  That also kinda dropped either away from the Tea Party or most GOP folks hammered that idea.  SSI might not give a great return, but it is there at retirement.  If we privatize it and those investments disappear, the federal government will be on the hook to support those people WITHOUT SSI money being paid in.    I think you are right in that we did have a big jump in the Tea Party approach for a while, but quickly most people for one reason or another came to realize that those extreme measures wouldn't work.  Even some hometown newspapers (Ted Cruz's comes to mind) have apologized for giving their public endorsement to Tea Party candidates.

I want to be clear, though, that I'm only speaking for myself in saying that I think that Wilson and other figures with questionable racial proclivities/dispositions should be acknowledged as such without being wiped from history.   In fact, I think that a far more balanced story of history should be told. It shows us that as a country, we had growing pains, and makes it easier to admit that we still have some things to work on, and in some cases, makes me proud to see how far the country has come despite it's shortcomings. I also have mixed feelings about other parts of our history. While words can't express how detrimental slavery has been morally and socially for our country, it also was the engine of economic prosperity through the creations the textile industry, many of our financial institutions to facilitate international trade, and a shipping industry that directly led to us having the strongest navy on the planet.   I wish that that was the narrative I was taught in school. I was taught that all the guys on our money were saints. Then later, some of my lefty friends and lefty literature told me that those guys were slave owners/racists and basically the definition of evil. I think it would be better if we taught that these men were human and had their flaws while they built the great yet flawed nation we live in today. I think that part of being a true patriot is loving one's country despite it's flaws and taking part in making it greater.  TL;DR History is complicated.Don't bury your head in the sand. Understand the pretty and ugly parts to make the country better in the future."

While, I may have come across as an apologist by not enumerating every shortcoming these men had, but even so, I'm pretty sure that my comment was calling for a balanced reading of history. I didn't say we should keep Wilson on the name of buildings or the Battle Flag of the Confederacy flying because frankly, I don't give a shit. I'll leave that debate to someone else.   All I'm saying is that it is far more constructive and interesting to study history this way. I am well aware of the shitty things these guys have done. My state's capitol, Jackson, is named after the General and POTUS who cleared the land of the resident Choctow and Cherokee citizens to make way for cotton plantations, which raised the demand for slavery. I get it. I think most of these guys were sleazy aristocrats more interested in the bottom line than anything else, but that doesn't stop me from trying to understand as much of the big picture as I can. Maybe, it's because I'm a chemistry student, but I try to check my emotions at the door when I read history so that I can fairly assess the gravity of the consequences of these figures' actions.  Bravo on the cherry picking."

I think that many of the people who accomplish 'great' things (generals and civic builders, pioneering surgeons) display self-assurance, will, bravery, etc. but might be shitty spouses, or mean bosses, what have you. Others bring different skills to the table- much of the Prophets in the Old Testament is basically an out of control ruler/warrior being told by a more morally-focused guy why he's failing as human being and power has usually gone to his (or his Queen's) head.  Teddy Roosevelt was a patronizing believer in the white race's superiority and obligation to dominate and teach the rest of the world, but on the other hand at least he left his urban elitism to discover a love of nature, because he spearheaded the conservation that has given us America's remarkable national parks. Few countries anywhere have that much natural environment preserved.  I can appreciate his nature insight while rejecting his racial civilizational one, but both should be taught.  And if I couldn't do that, I couldn't enjoy the great music and movies made by people who are often vain assholes."

If they're not just straight racists (which, admittedly, is the minute minority of the time), then they're glorifying the secession and they see the Civil War and the loss of the Confederacy as a horrible tragedy. The war, the Confederacy, and the flag shouldn't be forgotten, but the flag certainly shouldn't be flown in any sort of glory."
Republican,3azpbo,nerowasframed,5,Thu Jun 25 00:14:37 2015 UTC,I also like the idea that you can only be upset and want the removal of the flag if it directly was used in the murder of these 9 individuals....  And Travis asserts that we need context.

Republican,3azpbo,Crying_Viking,2,Thu Jun 25 02:02:35 2015 UTC,"See that's my problem with the article in general. Sure, be upset about the easily distracted/absentminded social media phenomenon - I can't refute that that's a problem. But, the confederate flag is a symbol of what Dylann Roof stood for. He had a jacket with the confederate Rhodesian patch sewed on there right next to the flag of apartheid-era South Africa (It wasn't a confederate flag, but he did have pictures of himself holding the CSA flag on his website). He believed that this flag was a symbol for what America used to be, and how it had been corrupted by minorities and other undesirables. He believed he was taking his country back, and used that flag as a symbol for his struggle/plight.   In my opinion, that makes that flag (which you have every right to wear personally, but is given legitimacy when it is flown from government buildings and is placed on state flags) not a side issue, but a main point of the entire sad story.  EDIT: Because I was wrong about the patches"
Republican,3azpbo,QskLogic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"But, the confederate flag is a symbol of what Dylann Roof stood for.   Don't get confused.

No more than any nutjob gets to inextricably link to the symbols they adopt."
Republican,3azpbo,drbillwilliams,2,Thu Jun 25 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"Dylann is not the only one that believes that flag stands for an idyllic view of what America, especially the south, used to be and what they believe to have been taken away from them. Sure, 99% of the people who display that flag would never do what Dylann did, but that doesn't mean that the flag doesn't mean the same to them as it does it to him. And once again, you have every right to display that flag personally, but it shouldn't be flown on government buildings/put on state flags where it is given an aura of legitimacy that it doesn't deserve."
Republican,3azpbo,QskLogic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:23 2015 UTC,"The bottom line is that you're taking the philosophy of the absolutely most hateful among us, projecting it without any real basis onto some larger percentage of people who have the flag, then delegitimizing the symbol for everyone.  That's dangerous, whether it's the cross, the crescent moon, an American flag, or a Che Guevara shirt.  That said, if I lived in a state in question, I'd support getting rid of it.  Just like as a Cleveland Indians fan I want Chief Wahoo gone.  But I live in New York and frankly it's none of my business that some places are backwards, so long as it doesn't result in actual discrimination that violates the Constitution.  Beyond that, I don't get to decide what is legitimate.  And just in case, the flag being on state grounds is no more responsible for the horrific actions in question than Marilyn Manson, video games, or gangster rap are responsible for all the things they've been blamed for over the years.  That the flag was flying somewhere official wasn't even the straw that broke Dylann's sick mind's back."
Republican,3azpbo,drbillwilliams,2,Thu Jun 25 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe this got off the rails a bit.  My original point was that this discussion about the confederate flag is not an example of a short-sighted social media phenomenon.  It is obviously not the core reason that this tragedy occurred, but it can be seen as a symptom of the society that encourages beliefs not dissimilar from those that Dylann held.  It was not the straw that broke the camels back, but it was most definitely a straw."

Military bases named after Confederate Generals are trying to be renamed, schools HAVE been renamed, mascots have been replaced, and the song Dixie has been banned at said schools.

Because every time I think we can't get dumber on social media, we get dumber.   The interesting part about this is how the whole confederate flag flap blew up over misleading news coverage.  Yes, Roof had a picture on social media holding a confederate battle flag.    Yes, the news reported he committed his attacks while wearing patches with an (unpictured) 'Apartheid Flag'.  We are left to assume that the 'Apartheid Flag' mentioned was the previously pictured confederate battle flag.  Of course, anyone who pays attention to how the news misleads would have recognized the oddly stilted language and investigated further.  Roof actually committed his attacks while wearing patches of two apartheid flags - the flag of Rhodesia, and the flag of apartheid South Africa.  The confederate battle flag was not among them.  The news won't tell you that, though, because it doesn't fit the narrative they want to push."

However immoral the practice, the law to allow or disallow it should come from state government, not federal. modern liberals would say the opposite. If what big government lovers say is the ""in thing"" why bother having individual states? What's the point if some federal law is going to be allowed to trump a law you made locally?"

It works perfectly fine, in my opinion, for education, for instance.  If any individual is being deprived of the right to life or liberty (the pursuit of happiness is vague in a legal sense), then the state, local, and federal governments have the imperative to defend those rights. If one fails, it fails the most basic job of government and the role of the others is even more essential.  When an entire government is established to maintain the systematic deprivation of those rights, it is the responsibility of all conservatives to crush that rogue state.   The CSA were treasonous, explicitly anti-freedom, and therefore, completely anti-thetical to conservative beliefs. I'm appalled that anyone could call themselves conservative and defend such a country's existence. It would be akin to supporting the Islamic Republic of Iran or DPRK."

If you're OK with that, then you should be just fine with voting being just as difficult and taking just as long.   A large number of guns are straw buys, but alas no federal study on the issue.   The Federal Government did a study on specifically what we are talking about - guns used in homicides, and how the people obtained those guns.  12.2% of firearms used in homicides were purchased from a family member or friend - note that covers all such purchases, including legitimate private sales where the weapon was sold months or years after the original purchase.  So, your method of 'preventing straw purchases' whatever that was, would essentially have to shut down all private sales where the buyer and seller had a prior relationship, to meet your 10% goal.  ...and even that wouldn't do it - because criminals, being criminals, resort to illegal methods to obtain what they want, when legal methods are closed to them - so rather than reducing homicides, all you would do is shift the percentages on the source of the weapon."

Of these - suicides with guns are by far the most prevalent.  Many would still commit suicide with another technique, but their success rate goes down when not using a fire arm (and thus chance someone intervenes to get them help).  The gun supply among the criminal population would still be a problem until the legal supply is completely gone.  Some criminals would still have weapons, but ammo/guns would be a lot harder (and more expensive) for the average gang member to procure if no legal supply existed.

Republicans are frequently called anti-intellectual.  One of the issues we have is that professors like the one mentioned in the article are teaching the children.  It is relevant to call attention to them.   The rules restrict posts complaining about how liberal Reddit is, this seems to fall intot he same category.    It does not.

Republican,3awrr8,AFriz,8,Wed Jun 24 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"I recall someone telling me once, in Europe, that the Nazi flag was actually the Roman Cross...so people should not be offended by it.  Well, the problem is... it was appropriated by Nazis and became their symbol.  The Confederate flag, regardless of technicalities became the symbol of slave-owning states.  Yes...the South did fight a war over states' rights.  They felt that losing their slaves would have severe economic costs... but... then or now, owning humans as chattel is wrong.  When the Civil War is taught, it is often boiled down to... the South was bad because it had slaves (though many in the North did, too) and they wanted to keep their slaves so they went to war against the heroic North.  The defeat that the South suffered has resounded to this day.  There lingers a sense that the North is ""better than"" the South.  I recall learning about the war as a Northerner and thinking, ""Thank heavens we were not the bad guys.""  And that's messed up when you think about it, because in the 70's no one was responsible for the Civil War.  Anyway, back to Europe... after WWI, the Germans were forced to accept the War Guilt Clause.  They had to take full responsibility for the war and to pay reparations for it.  This basically crippled them.  It was punishment on top of punishment. Being the ""bad guys"" and having to pay even as they needed to rebuild their own nation caused the conditions that led to the rise of Hitler.  After WWII, things got a little smarter and even though we knew that the Germans had done terrible things that led to war... they were given a bit of a break in trying to rebuild.    The rest of the world kind of said, ""That was terrible, but get your shit together, punish the evil doers and we will allow you to become a member of the world community and work to see that it never happens again.""  So, what the world was able to do for Germany... it kind of seems like we in the USA have never really been able to do for the South.  There are people who feel that they are intellectually superior to Southerners.  There are people who still hold the South, collectively, responsible for slavery.  There are people who say things like, ""I'd never go to _________, it's full of racists.""  After the war, the North destroyed and pillaged the South.  I'm sure that left a sense of resentment in the minds of many Southerners.  I think that, even today, there are probably folks who feel that the South, in general, gets a bad rap and it's past time to get over it.  But part of getting over it is acknowledging that the Confederate flag, in the minds of many, represents a repressive and racist South that needs to be a remnant of the past.  Also, the egregiously superior attitude of some in the North needs to slap itself down."

It was Lincoln who officially declared war.  I do not disagree that the confederate flag is inappropriate.  I do not disagree that slavery is abhorrent.

A common thread across state boundaries etc etc. So when I see they are taking it away from all these places, I don't feel like they are doing away with a symbol of hate, but instead one of Southernness.   Of course, the flag in front of that Capitol building was hardly a ""flag"". It looked a 1ft x 1ft fabric square on 1.5 ft of cord on a pole.

Our $18.2 TRILLION debt isn't due to the fact that Washington, D.C. isn't taxing enough. Today, Washington, D.C. rakes in 51% more in taxes than it did just six years ago. The only way to right the ship in Washington, D.C. is by cutting spending in all areas;  *** ENACTING A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT to stop politicians from piling debts on our children and grandchildren they can never repay;  *** CUTTING TAXES. Lower taxes are proven to create jobs because hardworking Americans spend the money they earn better than some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C. It's time to unleash prosperity by dramatically lowering taxes for ALL American citizens;  *** PASSING TERM LIMITS to end the reign of career politicians in Washington, D.C.;  *** FORCING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO ACTUALLY READ THE BILLS THEY PASS, and stop their habit of ramming thousand-page bills into law at the last minute before anyone knows what's being voted on;  *** REPEALING ALL OF OBAMACARE to stop the soaring health insurance premium costs, policy cancellations, shuttered hospitals, and poorer quality healthcare that have all resulted from this outrageous federal takeover;  *** AUDITING THE FEDERAL RESERVE to end the ""print-now, ask-questions-later"" policies that result in boom-bust economic cycles like the recent housing and financial crises;  *** PROTECTING THE ENTIRE BILL OF RIGHTS. That means protecting not just our religious liberties, political speech, and gun rights. It also means ending unconstitutional NSA spying to protect Americans' right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment."

Republican,3asira,beauboy93,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:45:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong: We need a non-politician as president to crack heads and change DC.

Coming straight out of a life-or-death war, he knew what success looked like and he knew what failure looked like and he had zero tolerance for failure.  Well, our culture has a Business Way and especially in the realm of venture capital, there is no room for excuses or failure. We need someone like that right now. I think either Trump or Romney could do that. Honestly, I think Romney is the scariest candidate for the establishment because he knows how to go into established corporations and turn things around. You do that not by being nice but by being intolerant of failure. Trump -- not so much but he ran several businesses well and you don't do that on your own unless you know how to do the same.  Ben Carsen? Nope, he doesn't know how to tell people ""Hell no!"" I am sure he has serious executive experience in his medical career, but I don't see that translating into the kind of executive experience we need running the government.  Walker is my second-best hope. At least he cracked skulls already and he knows how to kick butt and take names and still win elections.   Cruz and Rubio? Maybe Cruz can do some things, but honestly, we need him in the senate kicking butt and taking names. He's our man on the inside.  The core problem is that there simply isn't enough time to assemble the election team. As republicans, we rely heavily on local GOTV, canvassing, phone banks. We need the loyalty of the volunteers before we can do anything. The primaries are NOT the time to build up that core of volunteers. It's too late already.

Actually, if healthcare was socialized, the people you know wouldn't have lost coverage when they lost their job.

Also, this isn't the 1800s where corporations exploit the worker to the point of death.  Workers have greater leverage over corporations since it is easier to switch jobs (thanks to internet job boards).    The free market is the greatest weapon against ""corporate greed"".  The free movement of talent is what ensures that your employer has to pay you what you're worth otherwise you move on.    As far as income disparity is concerned, the best way to combat it is through education.  Why pay $15 an hour to a low skill worker that contributes essentially nothing to the economy when you can train that low skill worker for something like a welding job (that could pay $15+ an hour) AND the economy enjoys the benefit of being more productive in the welding sector of the economy.  If liberals asked to get poor people job training, I'd back it.  Find out what job sectors are in need, open training slots, and get those people to work doing something that earns a living wage.  I didn't bust my ass in school just so someone who chose not to do their homework can leech off of me."

Our MLS team being called The Union has as much to do with our place in Colonial America as it does the presence of labor unions. The private v. public sector unions was a great arguement.  Of course, unions are not perfect. They certainly have the opportunity to overly bargain and thus bring too negative a burden on a business. (now I'm not gonna lie, I don't see my mind changing on what I'm about to say) But, and this speaks to the nature of humans in general, greed has gone unchecked, as far as I'm concerned. I firmly believe in the concept of ""enough money""  I just can't stand (having been in retail for 10 years) knowing the millions of dollars floating around the top of these organizations that, if some of it would be dumped into payroll, would have a seriously positive impact on the lives of all employees.

They went from being workers united for a noble cause of being paid reasonable wages for work done, safe and fair working conditions and basically to be treated like human beings. Modern unions now expect the employer to cover all living expenses for employees- the 'cost of living increase', a healthcare plan that costs little to nothing for the worker and his/her entire family, increases in wage every year just because they are there another year. If all their demands aren't met, the union holds all the cards because of the ridiculous contracts they make the employer agree to. They strike and hold the company ransom until the company either submits or goes out of business. They don't negotiate. A prime recent example is the Hostess Bakery. Because of the greed and ruthlessness of their union, the company finally had to go out of business. They contribute to candidates who vow to give them more power and their leaders are incredibly corrupt.

I would rather have say over that myself and not just be a small voice in a pool that may not agree with the group.  I'm ok with having the choice to associate with some of my coworkers to collectively bargain with our employer to everyone's benefit, but only if it's my choice and not a big thing I have to sign on to just to be an employee.  Monopolies are bad, right? Some unions want to have monopolistic power over their segment of the labor market - auto workers, educators, etc.   I believe it is unchecked capitalism that has led to the income disparity we are suffering through today   I'm not going to dig into what you could mean by ""income disparity"". That's a whole can of worms that has little to do with unions. But I believe that most of the bad things that get blamed on capitalism are actually due to a lack of capitalism. Telecoms have too much power because they are granted that power by state and local governments through exclusivity contracts. Pharma and agri companies do bad things because they are granted that power through overbroad patent law.

Then trying to drag in that old, tired, completely misguided argument that the Confederate flag is racist. It did not stand for slavery. The war was not fought for slaves. It was fought because the federal government was enjoying too much power dictating laws that should be the authority of the individual states to write laws on...only one of those conflicts was slavery. Apparently no one has learned anything from the civil war because the same shit is happening. The feds want to micromanage everything, and the states are slowly losing their identities.

Second, is that he evidently will be gaining the endorsement of a California senator, Hayden, while much of the democratic party is keeping a cautious distance from Bernie.   This means he is sticking to his guns with funding principles, and that the party Establishment is coming around to potentially support him instead of the ""inevitability"" that Clinton goes to the big show.

Here's how anti Hispanic and immigrant republicans are: two of the leading presidential candidates are the children of Hispanic immigrants. Another likely candidate is the son of Indian immigrants.  Republicans tend to be anti illegal immigration but that's something different. My wife is an immigrant and both she and her family spent years jumping through legal hoops to become legal residents and citizens.  She resents people who came here illegally and might get to jump the line.  There also is an underlining sense, I think, that we have too many immigrants too assimilate properly, and the largest group are Mexican."

Republican,3aiomh,IBiteYou,6,Sat Jun 20 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I am very proud of my story. Just for some context, after 3 years of working at the company where she was originally offered her job (our first 3 years in the country), my mother started her own company. Now, for the past almost 20 years, she has been an employer that creates jobs, someone who never breaks a law and always wants to give people a chance. I saw her pull herself from the bottom to the top with no help from the government. I guess this is a big influence on why I lean towards republican ideas on many issues having to do with social aide.   An example of the rhetoric I'm talking about would be what got me thinking about this, which was the speech Trump gave when he made his announcement of candidacy. When he started talking about ""Mexicans"" (every Hispanic in the US has come to understand that when Americans say ""Mexican"" they mean all Hispanics, which is insulting to many of us that aren't Mexican at all, but the point is that when I hear Mexican I presume it's about me too), he seemed to focus on saying that ""Mexicans"" did so many bad things in America, and I just kept thinking about my family, not only my mom's story, but my younger brother also served in the army and fought in Afghanistan, and I just fell like the ""Mexican"" he was imagining had nothing to do with the ""Mexican"" I am. It really made me feel bad, because like I said, there are policy points that I agree with Trump. And it wasn't the first time I hear people talk like that about ""Mexicans"" and I just didn't know what to think. And it bothered me for a while, so that's why I made this post now."
Republican,3aiomh,IBiteYou,22,Sat Jun 20 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"Most of us feel that Trump is not a serious candidate, nor a suitable one.  Having lived here, you most certainly know that the USA is a diverse nation.  The population is fantastically eclectic.  The issue we are trying to deal with is illegal immigration.  I am opposed to encouraging illegal immigration and I feel that when we do amnesties, we only turn on a magnet that says, ""If you can just get into the USA, eventually the government will have to make you a citizen.""  It's not just the southern border, though, where folks are coming in illegally.  There's actually ""birth tourism"" from China...where women come here, have babies and then those babies are citizens.  There are people who come here on temporary visas and then decide to stay.  Until we get serious about controlling immigration into the nation, we will see more and more illegal immigration.  We are actively encouraging it.  It is, further, unfair to people who did things legally ... like your mother.  How many people can we absorb who came here illegally, before we have to say, ""There's too much population to support and we need to close down legal immigration""?  The Republicans have an issue with behavior, not an issue with ethnicity."
Republican,3aiomh,Elccorp,5,Sat Jun 20 19:04:36 2015 UTC,It is unfair for the people who came here legally. It makes me mad when I hear about the dream act and how many illegal immigrants are getting amnesty because of it. My family had to pay 11k a year to maintain a work visa and process of becoming a resident. We were left in limbo like this for 11 years. That is 121k more or less that we spent to become residents. And it is well damn worth every last penny. But it freaking pisses me off to hear amnesty for students. How does that make it fair for me..I am not sure how much they have to pay but I guarantee you it is not 11k per year. That is unfairness

Republican,3aiomh,themanbat,2,Sat Jun 20 23:17:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with those people about ignoring trump.  You really didn't give much of a concrete example.   When I hear people talk about Mexicans, I really assume they mean people crossing the Mexican border.   I guess he said that they did bad things? I don't know. The only thing I ever assume people are talking about is Mexicans who came here illegally. Or maybe Mexicans who are here legally, but are only here to send money back home - which isn't necessarily an insult to that particular Mexican - it's commentary on the system that allows that sort of negative drain on the economy.  Now, I did once have a liberal friend tell me that ""Mexican"" was racist. In conversation about actual people from Mexico. The country. I let him know I wasn't aware ""Mexican"" was a race. I didn't let him live that one down for a few years.  Conservatives, in general, LOVE legal immigration. Especially the kind that keeps the money here and boosts the economy.  Even temporary residence is a-ok with most of us, but there does reach a point, like the recent example about Disney's H1-Bs, where we see a drain and don't like it. There's a little wiggle room for debate on all that.  I'm sorry if you're hearing negative rhetoric. I don't really know specifically you mean. I just hope you don't automatically associate it with conservatives. Are you sure that you're not falling into the trap of hearing over and over ""right wingers are racist"", and then you hear someone say something racist and then automatically think ""that person must be a right winger"" without any other context?"

Seriously. It's not an issue of race at all. For the most part, we consider race to be a non-issue at best. Personally, I think it is a horrible social construct that was created out of bad science in the 1800s and should be done away with entirely. So when I talk about illegal immigration, race isn't a factor.  As for Trump's comments, as I noted below, not only is he not a serious candidate, he isn't even actually a Republican. He's donated enormous amounts of money to Democrats, including Clinton herself."

He even said it in the statement some mexicans are good. I am embarrassed to say that he really isn't far from the truth. I live in Texas were the population of Hispanics is fairly large, in my circle we are all LEGAL immigrants who are educated pay our taxes and do not commit crimes.

Maybe if they actually had to pay taxes to support our bloated Federal government instead of just being able to vote for people who will vote them infinite ""free"" benefits paid for out of someone else's pocket, they would get the idea that the government needs to be smaller and the waste needs to be cut.

If someone wants to really commit a heinous act of violence they will, regardless of their access to guns or not. One has to look past the weapon itself and investigate the social, economic, or even psychological context of the incident and it's perpetrator.

Of course, MSNBC doesn't mention that with their cherry-picked and often outright made-up stats. Pol Pot, Hitler, Mao, and Stalin all made sure to disarm their populations before slaughtering them. Confiscation is the equivalent of cutting the claws off a tiger; he'll have no means to fight back against jackals if and when they decide he's no longer necessary to their plans. England has a SEVERE problem with robberies and assault. More importantly, I've never heard of a US soldier being beheaded in the street by a foreign combatant with no one coming to his aid. Good luck pulling that off in Utah or Montana. Australia also has a problem with petty physical crime and sexual assaults. Go ahead and look at the timeline for a correlation. Tighter regulations most certainly won't control the violence, and Every. Single. Study. Done. has shown that. It's why Obama didn't release the CDC report he had done up after Sandy Hook. It's why Chicago, DC, and LA have all shared murder capital titles with insanely strong regulation. Look at NY and especially NJ's crime stats. New Orleans is the only pro-gun city that has topped that list in as long as I can remember.  The only 'mass shooting' that has occurred outside of a ""Gun Free Zone"" was the Tuscon Incident."

It goes both ways.   Tl;Dr: it's human nature to be prejudiced and to have some kind of hate or animosity toward others, it's a form of competition that's been around since the dawn of man.

None of those harsh policies are really viable in the states, so we should just assume anyone who wants a gun can get one and stop messing with unrealistic gun control laws that are basically just reactive rather than proactive.

Gun control, obsession with violence, and bullies.  Many of the shooters either were victims of or felt they were victims of unwarranted wrongdoings. Revenge seems to be a popular theme among the people committing these crimes. Either they were bullied, or felt like they weren't given the respect/attention/understanding that they deserved.  The point of revenge is to exert power over others in an attempt to punish them. Following this, many feel that controlling the source of this power (gun control) is the most obvious answer. Another view is that dealing with the source of the aggressor (mental care, bullying, obsession with violence) is the best course of action.

I think elements of society that aren't immediately partisan molded him and a lot of other recent spree killers into what they are, moreso than anything else. I think that society failed him in a way. But he alone is responsible for his crimes, and his personal problems are no excuse. The extremist politics certainly riled him up. He was a /pol/ kid plain and simple. But thats just him trying to soothe a deeper wound.  He's Elliot Rodgers if he rationalized his pain against blacks instead of women.

Iraq ended the regional threat of Saddam, postponing the as-yet-to-occur Great Arab War for another generation.  Afghanistan reminded the world that America is not to be fucked with.  Idiot professors like to say we ""lost"" these wars, but we sure as fuck weren't the ones standing in rubble.  In all cases, these wars were local, contained, and limited.  But they did not happen in a vacuum -- the world watched, and saw a fighting force they knew they couldn't reckon with and set their plans back another generation.  This especially worked on the USSR, whos expansion was countered only by the proven and demonstrated American will to pursue containment.  That's how the Pax America has been maintained: one generation at a time.  However, just like death, war cannot be postponed indefinitely and Obama has hastened its return."

Republican,3aahnn,HowAboutThisThough,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:10:48 2015 UTC,"That's the nature of the game.  Once you know the rules, you play to win.  In a free market, to survive, you have to be marketable.  Hence, when you go to college it would serve you better to take say a computer class over a humanities class.  When the market swings around you need to have skills that can easily translate across the job market.  I got a math degree.  I taught math for 6 years then left to do finance analysis.  Even if I lose that job I could go back to teaching or go into software development.  Let's say you are a doctor, if you lost your job, you aren't qualified for much else.  Although you could reason that the doctor could probably find another job, he's limited to only one field.    Same if you pursue welding or art.  So knowing that the free market exists, greed exists, and that at any moment you may lose your job due to someone's schemes (economic bubbles), it would be helpful to have a leg up in the job market.  The problem with anti-free market economies is that you are artificially placing value on things that may not justify the costs (such as a $15/hr burger microwaver).  This is already in play to a degree here in the states via subsidies.  Although yes, it does help some people out, you cannot artificially tweak the market without there being consequences.  Your mom and pop stores, although everyone loves them, can't compete with Wal-mart because let's face it, your mom and pop stores aren't savvy enough to keep up with an evolving market.  This doesn't mean that your favorite neighborhood coffee shop will lose out to Starbucks automatically, it just means it has to up its game to compete.  The advantage that non-large chains have is freedom.  Starbucks has to sell a certain product a certain way.  There are franchise rules.  It's best to better enforce the laws already in the books for combating corruption than to create new ones.  That goes for almost everything else.  Everyone wants more instead of better."

Maybe the business itself. This is an important issue.    In a free market, to survive, you have to be marketable.   This is true in any market in the long-run; especially true in the free-market.  A doctor is probably qualified for other stuff, but okay, that's not really your thesis.   The problem with anti-free market economies is that you are artificially placing value on things that may not justify the costs (such as a $15/hr burger microwaver)   Indeed, this is the heart of the ideology behind the free market. In hinges on the fact that the free market is the best way to allocate a price. I am sure you know of things like market failures. While I am not saying they are proof a free-market does not work, or even that we understand market failures correctly, I do want to point out that the idea of how to set a price is the most crucial point here, and it relies on the free market being the optimal way to set prices.   The advantage that non-large chains have is freedom.

However, I would seriously consider voting for him for a few reasons:  • He doesn't need anyone's money, lobbyists will have little to no affect on him.  • He understands the lobbying game as well as anyone because he's had to employ lobbyists to get things done for his own businesses. He has a integral understanding of what businesses need from government to thrive and produce jobs (and stay in this country)—something our country desperately needs.  • He has a proven track record of success—he understands the macro-economic extremely well. He is an incredible financial strategist.  Obviously, like any president, I don't think he would do everything right, and he may not even do most things right. However, I do think he would have to power and determination to turn this country's fiscal policy around. I'm not sure that Trump is the answer, however, we need someone with the financial interest of this country in mind (not the interests of the highest bidder) in order to accomplish things like brining jobs back, lowering the national debt and saving social security and medicare to name a few.  The biggest area of deficiency in my eyes is his lack of experience in foreign policy. Essentially, I think we'd just have to rely on him to surround himself with a top notch group of advisors for foreign policy and military decisions.  Overall, due to his lack of experience in the foreign policy/military arena, I'm not sure he's the person, but I think he brings a very intriguing dynamic to the GOP and this country's future.

You basically have a republican leader in charge of a nearly 50/50 split democrat/republican. On top of point #1, Florida is a ""moderate"" state.  It's not uncommon to have those that care about the environment also being hardcore christians.  Florida also heavily subsidizes college education, but only for those who make the grade (so it's merit based).  You see a combination of red and blue policies at work in the state.  Where one side will say ""the government will support you"" and the other side saying ""you need to earn it yourself"", Florida's motto would be ""the government will support you, but you need to earn it yourself"".   btw, I'm a former Floridian living in Texas."

The president doesn't need to be an ideologue;  Obama is the future's textbook example of what happens when you drop someone with zero administrative skills into an on-the-job training program for the largest administrative body in the country.  What the president needs to be is a proven administrator (I simply cannot emphasize that enough).  He must be able to garner the loyalty of both elite and expert.  He must be able to work with entrenched opposition.  In short, someone who has governed before.  That he is on the Republican ticket is enough to guarantee a Republican congress will have little difficulty passing law, both by withholding veto, but more importantly by earning the support of opposition."

Republican,39un6c,SeriouslySlick,13,Mon Jun 15 06:24:59 2015 UTC,"They're making fun of the fact that NY isn't underwater, I'm pointing out that NY was indeed underwater. Sandy was only one flood. My neighborhood has slowly experienced more and more flooding starting in about 2006. We had one flood then and thought it was weird. Now twice a year minimum is the norm. The boat ramp down the block from me used to have a ramp that you had to drive down to get your boat in the water, now the water is always at the top of the ramp. The cesspools in the neighborhood are now always full of water and cesspools need to be raised into little hills. The local beach is visibly not as wide as it used to be 10 years ago, the waterline is much closer to the steps that lead down to the beach. I know it's not just my area too, I was doing insurance adjusting for my job and I would see other locations that had similar situations. One autobody shop I dealt with had to relocate. It's not just one occurrence, these conditions most certainly did not exist like they do now, and we have never had a storm like Sandy in the past."

It annoys me when I see people suggest that scientists falsify their data so the USA can tax businesses. The conspiracy that suggests would involve tens of thousands of scientists, in every country, every academy of science, over the past several decades. With not one coming forth. ALL SCIENTISTS. Not just a good amount that they were able to persuade. ALL OF THEM AROUND THE WORLD WITH ALMOST 100% COMPLIANCE. Ones who have no benefit to helping the USA. It's absolute lunacy. While ignoring the fact that the handful of climate scientists who deny these facts have been proven to be taking money from oil companies, which is EXACTLY what you accuse the legitimate scientists of.  That conspiracy makes holocaust deniers look sane. The amount of evidence that would have to be faked would be unfathomable. Plus big oil or the Koch's millions spent on climate denial can't debunk ANY of that ""fake"" data? Shouldn't it be easy to debunk lies? Instead we get a bunch of blogs, pseudo science, and easily debunked lies. Why the consistent lying if climate change isn't real, shouldn't the truth be easy to prove? Plus the amount of money that would have to be involved would dwarf anything the US would make in taxes and cap and trade (which hasn't even been implemented so all of this money has just gone to waste?). It doesn't even make sense financially. Plus all of these scientists would have had to been approached BEFORE their studies, so maybe the US has time machines too? Because it's not like they proved global warming wasn't caused by humans and then changed their minds or were convinced otherwise, there haven't been legitimate scientific data disproving global warming that was released and then retracted after being bribed. You would also need teams of employees working every country to approach and influence these scientists, but no sign of these people exists nor funding for them. None of these secret employees or their families have come forth in decades either. The probability is higher that lizard people took over our government."

These people supposedly have Ph.Ds and would fail a lab science course if they didn't know how to take proper readings.  The earth has actually been on a cooling trend for a while. That's why winters in places have gotten worse, that's why multiple feet of snow piled up in Boston.   You tell them about the #1 cause of atmospheric pollution, being volcanoes which are natural and uncontrollable, and they make up this BS claim that the CO2 that comes from volcanoes has a different ""signature"" than what comes from smokestacks and car tailpipes and they find more of the latter variety in the atmosphere, so it must be human created. Um, CO2 is CO2, there are no different varieties. Even if some has carbon 12, carbon 14 etc in it, those are just isotopes with a difference in neutrons. It doesn't chemically affect the compound.

Republican,39un6c,PoliticallyBicurious,4,Mon Jun 15 12:10:38 2015 UTC,"I would just like to note that your first point is slightly more complicated than PhDs who can't read thermometers. Picture you measuring a room that always has a constant temperature and you buy a new thermometer and it reads 0.25 degrees hotter than your old thermometer. The room didn't change, just your measurement tool so you have to calibrate to that effect. Now scale up your room to the size of the globe, add thousands of measurement sites with multiple and changing methods of measurement, temperatures varying drastically depending on time of day you measure, and changing times for measurement. It becomes a massive statistical problem to accurately correlate your data. Their methods can improve over time so it is not unreasonable to data to be changed in the future. There are certainly opportunities for mistakes or bad intentions but data adjustments aren't inherently bad.  For the CO2, you said the claim that there are different signatures is BS but that the carbon can have different isotopes. If they can measure the concentration of CO2 with a given isotope, and it is changing, are you saying that it is BS that certain carbon isotopes are indicative of man made CO2 or that it is BS that we can measure the difference?"

The Investment Chapter -   The Investment Chapter highlights the intent of the TPP negotiating parties, led by the United States, to increase the power of global corporations by creating a supra-national court, or tribunal, where foreign firms can ""sue"" states and obtain taxpayer compensation for ""expected future profits"". These investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) tribunals are designed to overrule the national court systems. ISDS tribunals introduce a mechanism by which multinational corporations can force governments to pay compensation if the tribunal states that a country's laws or policies affect the company's claimed future profits. In return, states hope that multinationals will invest more. Similar mechanisms have already been used. For example, US tobacco company Phillip Morris used one such tribunal to sue Australia (June 2011 – ongoing) for mandating plain packaging of tobacco products on public health grounds; and by the oil giant Chevron against Ecuador in an attempt to evade a multi-billion-dollar compensation ruling for polluting the environment. The threat of future lawsuits chilled environmental and other legislation in Canada after it was sued by pesticide companies in 2008/9. ISDS tribunals are often held in secret, have no appeal mechanism, do not subordinate themselves to human rights laws or the public interest, and have few means by which other affected parties can make representations.   Intellectual Property Chapter -   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership_intellectual_property_provisions https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp   It's honestly too long for me to sit here and explain and there are way to many provisions in the IP chapter to go over. The main gist of the IP chapter is that it will stifle free speech and whistle blowers by enacting harsh penalties for revealing ""trade secrets"", put a halt on Fair Use, expand copyright laws to lengths that make no sense (think of who profits) and then adding very harsh penalties for infringing those copyrights, widely expand the ability for companies to patent (also removing ""best mode"" as required under current US law), and the list goes on.  We have only seen a few chapter of the TPP so far but the results are extremely troubling. The biggest issue here is that everything has been negotiated in secret, there is 0 transparency. As an American citizen, I have no idea why congress would want to allow Fast Track. Let the treaty come to the floor for a debate. Everything surrounding the treaty and the negotiations is secretive, yet, the bill will allow for the United States (and every other member nations) sovereignty to be dissolved. Congress will be restricted on the laws they can enact. Current laws we have on the books will be changed in order to align with the treaty.  It's a long, tough, and complicated issue."

Generally, dirty glasses aren't really dangerous--it's more a cultural thing to shun them.  The risk is bacterial growth if the lemonade isn't kept cold enough or takes too long to sell. You won't be able to see anything wrong with a bacterial laden glass of lemonade.  Cold doesn't kill the bacteria. It just greatly reduces their growth rate, so that if food is kept properly cold until service you get some bacteria, but nothing your immune system won't be able to easily smack down without you even noticing.  If the food is allowed to temporarily warm up, the bacteria growth rate goes way up. Cooling the food back down slows the growth rate, but now you have a food that has a lot of bacteria, possibly more than your immune system will be able to easily take care of, and so now you can actually get sick."

Someone gets sick due to either something they end up being allergic to in the lemonade, some slight carelessness of the kids selling it or something completely unrelated that just happened to be triggered at the same time, everyone lawyers up and goes looking to sue. Then instead of trying to teach your kids that you have to earn money, the government shows them how easy it is for them to take it away.  In some places it's not even the issue of a health inspection and certification before they shut you down. If you haven't applied for and gotten a local business license (why places need to be ""licensed"" to open for business?) Which basically amounts to a local tax, and gotten the state authority to collect sales tax, they'll shut you down because you didn't go through all the channels to sell something. The local magistrate has to wet his beak with the measly sales tax you'll collect from a 50 cent glass of lemonade....  I'm surprised yard sales don't get shut down for the same reasons. Even though it's just for a few hours one or two days, they could technically still classify it as a business, make you at least get a temporary permit to sell for a fee and then make you collect sales tax on what you sell and give it to the state of locality if it requires local tax. You can't just have money change hands anymore without the authorities taking their cut. Pretty sad."

Republican,39frpb,RabidRaccoon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:43:58 2015 UTC,"I liked this bit -   In a recent book, “National Insecurity: American Leadership in an Age of Fear”, David Rothkopf, the editor and chief executive of Foreign Policy magazine, sees a fateful symmetry between the policies of Mr Obama and his predecessor, Mr Bush. One president went too deep into Iraq, the next got out too soon; the first over-reached, the second under-shot; the Republican wanted to use American power to strike enemies everywhere; the Democrat often seemed to treat American power itself as dangerous. But whereas Mr Bush improved in his second term, writes Mr Rothkopf, Mr Obama has not learnt from his mistakes.  Return to the centre  Few in Washington expect any change to Mr Obama’s do-little policy in his final 19 months. So the city’s myriad foreign-policy experts are busy drafting presentations and memos advising the next president on how far to swing back towards action. Opinion polls, which long gave Mr Obama a higher approval rating on foreign policy than for his overall job performance, now give him poorer marks for his handling of the world, suggesting such a swing might be welcome.  Mr Obama’s likeliest successors, including the Democrats’ front-runner, Hillary Clinton, will want to be seen as more forceful. In the Republican camp there is one isolationist, Senator Rand Paul, who blames his own side’s “hawks” for the mess in Iraq and Syria. The rest talk of doing more—much more in the case of Senator Lindsey Graham, who is calling for the deployment of 10,000 troops in Iraq (see page 38). Some Republicans have hinted that they would repudiate an Iran deal.  Between these positions, though, there is a centre ground that both Jeb Bush—who has said that, had he known in 2003 what he knows now, he would “not have gone into Iraq”, as his brother did—and Mrs Clinton might well stake out. You can see it in the recommendations of a bipartisan group of foreign-policy panjandrums issued by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy: inflict large enough losses on IS to reduce its recruiting appeal; build up a moderate opposition in Syria with a haven from which it can “change the balance of power”; improve ties with Egypt as the starting point for rebuilding the states of the Arab world; and halt the fraying of relations with Israel.  The authors know the next president will operate under constraints. The budget cuts of the so-called sequester will limit Pentagon spending. Russian expansionism and Chinese muscle-flexing will demand attention and resources. The public will not want war. Tellingly, the authors say that American “ground forces are not the answer” to IS. They also accept that a nuclear deal “can provide the basis of an effective control regime”, although it should be matched by clear American warnings about the consequences of cheating. If Sunnis are to be mobilised to confront IS, “Iran cannot be a putative ally”.  The next president may well be warmer towards Israel, and more willing to turn a blind eye to new settlements in the occupied territories. He or she might do more to reassure Gulf monarchies and speak more sternly to Iran. In Iraq, special forces might be allowed out of their bases to help spot targets for air attack, and to stiffen Iraqi units. In Syria, a more robust effort to train a moderate force, if only to gain a place at the negotiating table, could be instituted. There might be no-fly zones of some sort.  Such moderate activism could do good—though it could also lead to reverses which, unlike Mr Obama’s lost opportunities, are plainly visible. What it will not do is change the fact that the Middle East, still a vital source of energy and the cradle of great religions, is undergoing a profound upheaval. Discredited Arab states, many created out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire after the first world war, are collapsing in their turn. America cannot stop that. By taking an active role it may be able to help in the transition to some new, possibly better, arrangement, and to stave off the worst outcomes. But the process will still be bloody, and long-drawn-out."

I am sure someone in law enforcement may have more to say about it, but the change has been fairly innocuous.  Yes, a lot more people smoke pot.  No, the sky isn't falling.   Nationwide legalization is an inevitability.  This issue is akin to gay marriage.  There are many in the party who disagree with it, but is this really the hill you want to die on?  Is THIS an issue that really matters enough to lose moderate conservatives and youth votes over, and thus give up the White House again?  I do not like Christie, but this is just him sealing his fate over the least important issue to most people, who would just like to get a better job and feed their families.  It is also a great example of why the old guard in the Republican party needs to get out of politics and give us a chance in 2016."

And by the time someone who has smoked, gets behind the wheel, gets pulled over, takes a sobriety test, is deemed under the influence, gets to the station/hospital for a blood test the level of THC may have dropped from 50-100 ng/mL (""I'm stoned"") to 5 ng/mL (""I'm fine"").  Since THC levels go down in a pretty short amount of time (peak highness happens in about 10minutes after a good drag and rapidly decreases to 4 ng/mL in a couple hours, you can pretty much smoke and drive and be fine and have low to no level of 1) impairment and 2) THC. Seems to me that this 5 ng/mL is to allow for how quickly THC wears off to be accounted for in a DUI.   It's much the same way that I can blow a 0.08 BAC and feel completely sober."

It's not changing your body to conform to society's expectations, but to feel comfortable in it. It's biologically expected that a 'male' gender would be in a 'male' body (and likewise for female), so when it doesn't happen, i.e. the person is transgender, then you actually makes you feel uncomfortable in your body. Sexual re-assignment surgery gives you a body that your mind (via your gender) can operate with properly.   It really isn't about appearance, but functionality. It's not making yourself look like a girl/boy to make people think you are one, but finding a body that works for you. It's getting a body that operates inside and out as close to your gender as you can get, to feel right and at peace."

The people moderating internet forums, the new public sphere, are essentially reprobates and this is the only form of power they ever have had or ever will have, and it is anonymous and utterly tyrannical, but they don't care because they see themselves as victims, which makes it easy to justify to themselves anything they do.

I think at the end of the day it's going to be Walker. He's the safest bet. He'll get all the usual red states, very likely get Wisconsin (who doesn't love their own?) and Michigan, and have a decent shot at Ohio and Pennsylvania. That would be enough to win.   Cruz is a darkhorse for the nomination but he might be too socially conservative for our current political climate.

But honestly, the biases here are clear, and when a politician does something bad, I'm not going to hesitate to call him a lousy politician. I imagine those comments would be more upsetting to an outsider than my comment on Hillary's dress. Of course it all depends on their attitude going in. When I make a comment on Hillary's dress, I don't mean it with any intent to disparage her personally. I mean it more as an amusing thing to notice, like I might if Lady Gaga wore some crazy outfit. I pretty much just assume people realize that. But again, it depends on peoples' attitude going in. I'm not really the kind of person to walk on eggshells just to keep a few people from getting offended, because I believe a lot of that comes from people just working themselves up over nothing.

Republican,38t7t1,MattPalumbo,-3,Sat Jun 6 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"People have to realize that companies and businesses are started for one reason and one reason only: to make money for the business owner and the shareholders. Employees are a necessary evil to make the company work. They are an afterthought. CEOs have an intensely important job to keep the company going ad make the most important decisions. If you happen to run a business where it's mostly minimum wage joe 6 packs...then yeah paying them $15/hr will destroy the company. The company has no concern whether your cost of living goes up. They pay you what's considered right and fair to pay you for what your job is. If by fair they mean bare minimum wage, so be it. A cashier, burger flipper or shelf stocker is a job for a high school/college student job with no experience. NOT a job for someone who lives on their own, or has a family to support. Sorry, I just can't feel for you if you flip burgers for a living and you have to pay to keep your family afloat. You obviously fucked up somewhere. It's a mistake you made and you alone are responsible for it, not every taxpayer in America and not the problem of your employer either."
Republican,38t7t1,lloydlindsayyoung,2,Sun Jun 7 06:01:23 2015 UTC,"That's just not true. There are non-profit companies, for example.  And the minimum wage has gone up plenty of times in the past without destroying the world.   Also, advertising a lack of sympathy isn't attractive anymore."
Republican,38t7t1,epophoto,2,Sun Jun 7 20:56:57 2015 UTC,"Your right except for saying the business pays what is ""fair"", ""fair"" does not come into it.  As you noted employees are a ""necessary evil"" to the business, they are overhead.  And just like costs on the line the business seeks to pay the least the market will let them for the quality of service they need.  It is not about a fair wage at all it is about the lowest cost competition on the market for employees will allow.  If a business could get employees at a nickel a day they would because its cheaper (which they do overseas).  Capitalism is great but unbridled capitalism eats people to make money.  The minimum wage is a double edged sword, while creating a floor in what businesses pay their employees so that we don't have the rampant abuse of people we had from business in the early 20th century, it also creates a standard, which without colluding businesses can largely follow or bid roughly around and achieve a fairly even market.  The only way to battle this is to keep raising that minimum with either inflation or COL.  A cashier or a shelf stocker making minimum wage in the 1960s made much more than a modern cashier adjusted for inflation today.  $15/hr may be a bit high (depending on the area) but an increase is sorely needed."

The higher level kids could take pre algebra and lower kids took regular math. This determined what math class you'd be in for the rest of your public school career. Now, kids are almost always put in regular math (as opposed to around 60% before) and my brother who is definitely smarter than me at his age is in regular math even though I got to take pre algebra in 6th grade.

He had sex appeal and was a go-getter yuppie Regan supporter. But after both Bush administrations it seems the democrats are more moderate. They support gay marriage and pot smoking and abortion and secularism over religion. And they are kind of the new ""silent majority."" They came out to elect a black muslim for 2 terms. The birthers and the tea party are vocal - but the truly progressive are basically speaking with their vote that put a son of a mixed marriage ( white woman and black man ) which itself was illegal when he was born - put him in the oval office with NO reservation. These young democrats are not ""nationalists"" in the sense of thinking Americans are ""superior"" or the moral compass of the planet. They believe in critical thought and looking at evidence instead of just believing what you have been told. The republican party simply has to shift to compete. All the constituents are getting too old to make it to the ballot box. They can only block illiterate democrats from voting for so long"

And just because you haven't studied/understand how evolution works doesn't mean we are accidents. Humans exist today not because of ""accidents"" but because of natural interactions over millions of generations. Humans did not accidentally discover evolution unless you consider science an accident.

For politics I am sure he says he is Christian but I bet you dollars to doughnuts he keeps them all in the same cultural perspective. He probably thinks as Mohammed and Christ as in the same boat. He would never say it because he is a smart man and knows it would be political suicide. But here is a good refresher for you on the debate and politics before he was elected.   Yes I understand evolution. I am talking about the big bang. That all the matter set in motion and noting has any intention - so it is accidental simply following laws of thermodynamics. All by chance but fixed to the movement of matter.  And humans accidentally formed into beings that Know they are accidents themselves. I think you are talking about evolution but there was stuff that happened previously. Even previous to big band. So if there is no accepted purpose I just say it is accidental. It is not negative - just factual.

The rna world hypothesis (although others exist) is a convincing piece explaining how precellular life could have gained heredity and catalytic function. I encourage you to investigate that for yourself. IMO the big bang is the hardest thing to study because it created space and time. So a lot of physics is subject to change in the first fraction of a second after the big bang. But just because we do not know all of the answers doesn't mean that a higher being (which many argue is more complex than the big bang, itself) exists and made everything have a purpose. The sheer size of the universe with only 1 known planet containing life, at least, means the vast majority of the universe is purposeless."
