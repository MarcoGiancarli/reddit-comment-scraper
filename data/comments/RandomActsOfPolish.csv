Because the cost of being trans and getting surgery(which would be the route I would go) in America is ridiculously high.($50,000-$70,000)"

Somehow, contacts have been different for me. I struggled to get them in/out for the first few days (which is normal anyway) and it's been all good since then.

I just learned how to scan pictures in a few months ago. Its my SO's fault because he is a computer engineer, so if i need something done with the computer, he just does it. Which was fine before, but now i wish i had him teach me how to do it.   because im pretty sure putting together nail polish secret santa memes is at the top of his list."

I specifically love floral/fruity/citrusy smells. Mani fizzies would be okay but I would keep them to a few, I can't see myself using them more than a couple times.  I would love any and all homemade goodies you send, just beware that I live in Florida and chocolate heavy things will most definitely melt.   I LOVE YOU SANTA. KISSES.  Edit: As for scents I hate I would stay away from super sweet smells like candy smelling things. Sickly sweet is a no no (chocolate smells, cotton candy, stuff like that)  Edit 2: I bet I'm gonna get addicted to mani bombs now...LOL"

RandomActsOfPolish,3dqv8o,BlueSprite714,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:46 2015 UTC,In the sun it looks nude-ish but without the sun it's kind of a dull gold. And top coat dulled it so I didn't use any and now I've got a bunch of tip wear and dull stamping. It didn't bother me too much because I was supposed to get some new polishes today but they're lost (super sad face) so now I'm unsure if I want to redo them or not. I might just stick it out for another couple days in the hopes that my lost polish finds its way home lol

RandomActsOfPolish,3dqv8o,Bunnynose7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:11:24 2015 UTC,I ended up calling the post office this morning and they said they are being forwarded to me and not returned to the seller so that's good. Now it's just a waiting game til I get them. I'll be interested to see what actually is on the shipping label because I contacted the seller who said they print the label from PayPal so there shouldn't have been any issue.

I'm actually in a polish de stash right now because for the nursing program I won't be able to paint my nails very often. I only have 2 indie polishes, and I would like more, but I don't have any specifics. I have MCP October Sky, and MCP Thanks You! I have been after a thermal polish for a while.  I do have a bathtub. :) I have two stamper sets (MASH brand and the pink one that was one of those ""as sold on tv things). I haven't gotten a pattern big enough to fit my whole nail, so I stick to the little flowers and things like that. I do use decals when I'm in a hurry. $500 would mostly be spent on a new sewing machine and dressform from JoAnn's. I mostly buy polish at TJMaxx, so the rest would go towards polish or purses at TJMaxx.

To answer your questions:   Hmm, probably the same as my favourite polish colours - purple, blue, grey, green... I mostly live in jeans and t-shirts/tops but do like a nice dress when the weather is good. Silver! I like silver, not a fan of gold. I have 2 silver/pearl necklaces, a silver leaf necklace (those ones made from real leaves), and a silver Sphere of Life necklace with cubic zirconia in it. I like opals, malachite, tanzanite, but don't have any jewellery with those stones. In terms of bracelets I actually prefer bangles (silver again). Here are my two bracelets. I'm quite picky when it comes to jewellery, hence why I don't have much of it! I am! But I don't have a bath (and haven't for years) and I'm not allowed candles in the place I'm currently renting. Vanilla is one of my favourite scents, along with cherry. And if I were in charge, I'd ban all lavendar-smelling things. Ick. Oh man... This is a tough one... I think I'd rather eat cookies, but I'd rather bake a cake. Summer! Because that's when my birthday is! But I do love Christmas too!  Hmm... Nothing I can think of right now...

I didn't want to go at first but now I'm really sad we're staying home. I miss the family and could honestly use a weekend away from my phone, computer, school and city. I feel so burned out and today was kinda shitty. work was crazy. I got there at 10 and they sent me home to change (knee length shorts are apparently not appreciated by corporate, lol. I wear them all the time but today they had some one important visiting) so I had to take the bus a total of 4 times by the end of the day.  I also had to walk a ton because the bus stop is almost a mile from my apt. then my big boss (who totally puts up this total hard ass tough guy front) pulled me into the office and gave me $5 for bus fare and said it was just corporate bullshit and that I could stay late to make up the hours I missed while I was gone.   I honestly almost cried because it was very kind of him.   anyway, I started a crochet blanket just now and I'm enjoying the easiness of the granny square pattern and the yarn feels really nice to work with. shout out to /u/frankiecat_ for helping me with the color choice! (it's red heart soft brand.)  sorry to be a downer. just needed to have more of a whine than I've already had today i guess. haha. I'm trying to shop for my match tomorrow in between homework.

I use these pens to color with and just got some colored pencils with a blender pen to try. I really want to get the watercolor pencils but they are seriously out of my price range right now but are totally on my wish list!  If you love the adult coloring like I do Johanna Basford's facebook is great (she is the author/artist of the Secret Garden and Enchanted Forrest). She is making her third one now that is an ocean theme and she is very active on the page even posting fan submissions. She is great!

RandomActsOfPolish,3dkcq1,Maevora06,2,Fri Jul 17 04:00:38 2015 UTC,oh my lordy girl! You are missing out! The Secret Garden book has thinner paper so deff go with pencils but these pens are amazing! THe Enchanted Forrest paper is thicker and does not bleed. For most other books it is one image per page so I just put a file folder behind it so there is no issue. There are TONS of printables too. its a great whole new thing! But the Enchanted Forrest Book is my favorite by far!  But Look at Johanna Basfords photos she posts of fan's work. Like this one was done with water color pencils...shit is amazing!  Also i found a small but wonderful coloring reddit and This picture was one shared on there.

I like seeing polish families :)"

RandomActsOfPolish,3dju4p,miiimi,3,Thu Jul 16 21:15:05 2015 UTC,"Your paints sounds bad! I only use acrylics and love them. /u/batdalek can tell you of many a nights I've cursed the skies because I attempted with polish art.   I grab the bottle kind from walmart as they are less messy for me. Easy to get more of when your nails are wet since they have a flip top. Plus you can leave then In puddles on a plate without them drying up or eating throw styrofoam! Also if you didn't know, they are fantastic mostly because you can erase any error with alcohol. Just top coat your base color then paint until your heart is happy and top coat again!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3dju4p,unlodgical,2,Fri Jul 17 00:08:14 2015 UTC,thank you! I ended up throwing them away and buying new ones from Michaels. (25% off wooo!) and those don't smell at all. also thanks for the tip! didn't think of using top coat after the base coat.
RandomActsOfPolish,3dju4p,unlodgical,2,Fri Jul 17 01:30:11 2015 UTC,"It really was a game changer for me and the reasoning to switching to paints. Any time you mess up anything with polish you have to waste time redoing everything. This way it saves you time and alcohol fixes all problems. I've not found a top coat that disagrees with acrylics, but for reference I usually use my surplus for the base color (seche/kbshimmers) then use seche, KB, or HK girl for on top of the acrylics. :)"
RandomActsOfPolish,3dju4p,lochnessie15,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:11:06 2015 UTC,thanks! and lol alcohol fixes all problems 😉
RandomActsOfPolish,3dju4p,lochnessie15,2,Fri Jul 17 07:35:54 2015 UTC,"I don't use acrylic paint for my nail art, but I've used it for a bunch of other crafts. I've always found the smell to be super mellow, since craft acrylic paints are typically water based. I've also never had them last much more than a year or two; they've always dried out.  When I think acrylic paints, something like this is what I think of - widely available at craft stores, Walmart, etc. Were you handling something different? Otherwise, maybe age really did take a toll on them."
RandomActsOfPolish,3dju4p,MorningStarshine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:40 2015 UTC,mines look like a small tube of toothpaste and it says acrylic on them? I also opened them all at once to clean them so maybe the combined smell of them?

RandomActsOfPolish,3dgtlg,secretagentkitty,6,Thu Jul 16 04:34:27 2015 UTC,"I have accepted that as an intern who switches between overnight and day shifts constantly, and then as an exclusively ER vet who wants to work swing or overnights, that I will NEVER have a normal sleep schedule again. Sometimes I get maybe 3 hours, other times if it's my day off (or recently, haha the day before I ended up being hospitalized), I'll sleep for 16+. Gah. Whatevs, just rolling with it, I guess.  I'm out of the hospital!!!! It was a terrible experience in so many ways. I unfortunately have to return back to work on Friday (with my 14 hour overnights), which equates to only 36 hours in between my hospital discharge and getting back to work. Being an intern is especially brutal."
RandomActsOfPolish,3dgtlg,ootalia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:52:20 2015 UTC,Yay for being out of the hospital!! Do you feel better?
RandomActsOfPolish,3dgtlg,secretagentkitty,3,Thu Jul 16 11:59:39 2015 UTC,"Kind of. I'm not in terrible pain anymore, so that is definitely a plus!   Still feeling dizzy, and just off. Also, I had eaten solid food in over 5 days (due to the nausea, then doctor's orders), so that's taking some getting used to again."

They x ray tech came out and I had to do a double take.  He looked so much like my ex.  I almost said what are you doing here to him.  my ex is not a x-ray tech nor does he live in the same city as me. so weird when things like that happen.

Boyfriend has the day off and he's taking me to the festival in our city and then to the mall to shop for my giftee!   It's going to be 90 degrees and sunny for the concert I'm going to next Sunday. I have no clue what I should wear. I want a cute dress or tank but I just can't think of anything I like at the moment.  Got in an argument with someone today about one of those stupid pyramid schemes. It's called WorldVentures or something. I looked into it before he even talked to me because I saw all his posts about it. So when he tried to invite me to his party and I declined he got ticked. Dude we went to highschool together 5 years ago and I hardly talked to you. Then he was just so mad he couldn't talk me into going. I get you have to sell your product but if I say I'm not interested don't try to bug me about it.  I hope everyone's week is as awesome as mine has been. I love you all!!"

Tricked us into coming over for a sangria party and we got to do not one...not two...but THREE different presentations from various places (okay one was jewelry and was totally fun, but the rest were not). I may have sneaked out with my brother and brother in law and got drunk in the barn :D   Cute dresses are the BEST for concerts, unless it's windy and then they're just dangerous. Hope you have a blast!!!"

But if I say no don't argue about it. I had already researched the program and knew what it was about. That made him so mad. He tried to disguise it as a party too! I saw through it because we probably talked all of 5 times in high school? Now all of a sudden I'm invited to your house? Annoying!  I hope to find a dress I like. I'm so self conscious in them!

For everyone else, a note about Bondi: I think that company's long gone now, but if they ever pop up, never ever give them money. They were a new brand that seemed really super awesome for about 6 months, and then ran off and screwed over a bunch of customers. But they had some damn good polishes, and they're worth picking up if you see them cheap in a destash."

I don't think I actually own any milani polishes, how do they work for you?   0 pets. :(  Favorite shows: Scrubs, Weeds, That 70s Show.

RandomActsOfPolish,3devmg,BlueSprite714,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:54:37 2015 UTC,o i just looked up that blue i love it.. it is kind of tiffany-ish i need one that color!  Ya know i actually really like the new milanis in the drug stores that are round with the gold top...they have a nice wide brush and the formula is on the thicker side and really opaque for the ones i have. i think theyre one of my favorites from the drug store other than sally hansen. theyre about 5 bucks by me and have b1g1 half off so i have a couple. not much of a selection though. I feel like all my manis chip no matter what but i change them so often im not all stressed about it! im just rough with my hands i guess.  I dont have cable either i have a roku so i have netflix and amazon i watch mostly. my cousin gave me her cable info and hulu info so i have hulu and hbo n showtime and all that too through the roku.  Oh man reccomendations?! i could go on forever (seriously lol!!!) since i dont have cable i watch ALOT on netflix... id rather binge watch stuff at this point anyway bc im so spoiled i dont want to wait a whole week for the next episode?! WHO DOES THAT?! haha what kind of stuff do you like in terms of genres? otherwise id list 200 shows probably haha
RandomActsOfPolish,3devmg,moe-money,2,Thu Jul 16 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"Roku? Never heard of that!   I feel the same way, I do like watching shows that are still coming out, but I'd rather just wait for a show to be over, and then binge watch it. It's so much easier to understand what's going on that way.  I love Scrubs, which is a medical comedy drama, if you've never seen it. I really want to get into Grey's Anatomy. Lots of dramas (LOST being #1) that I want to get into.   I love That 70s Show (currently on the 2nd season), but I don't actually like sitcoms that much. I want to get into Friends and Seinfeld, but every time I sit down to watch them, I can't get into it.   I really hate fantasy shows (Game of Thrones kind of shows), I can't relate to them at all.   What are your favorite shows??"

(although the procedural crime dramas are starting to get annoying!) theres just so many of them.... i stopped watching greys years ago but i used to love it and it is on netflix id prolly get hooked again if i tried to catch up. scrubs id see every now and then and loved it but never went straight through it on netflix.... some shows that you MIGHT like maybe that i love could be blacklist, the killing, ive heard AMAZING things about luther but havent gotten to it yet-- im LOVE NCIS it just came on netflix and made my fkn life haha. thats all crime stuff. shameless the uk version is a really amazing comedy i loved ... parks and rec, 30 rock, kimmy schmit -all great comedies. i loved that 70s show too (and freaks and geeks if you havent seen that i wish it wasnt cancelled!) i could go about shows forever i watch way too much tv lol"

RandomActsOfPolish,3de59c,ilysespieces,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"Welcome! A good number of our group started out like you, nail biters who polish to stop it and became obsessed.   What's your favorite polish color? Do you have a favorite brand?"
RandomActsOfPolish,3de59c,ilysespieces,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"I'm finding myself drawn to oranges and greys for some reason.  About the only colors I'm not a huge fan of are beige, browns and some greens. As for brands- I'm a equal opportunist. I like good deals so I tend to buy Sinful colors (can't wait to try their Sinful Shine).  I've tried about every brand and there isn't one I really dislike.  Color Club, China Glaze and OPI.  I want to get into indie brands, but honestly there are so many I have no idea where to begin!"

I really like the full image plates, so I can select random parts and not have to worry about the design being smaller than my nail. I'm drawn to geometric and abstract designs; I have a TON of floral themed plates so I'm good on those. I also love anything and everything nerdy! I do have the epic BM-415 plate already. As for files, I have no idea! I have some emory boards from the dollar store o.O I've always wanted to try a glass file because I have a feeling I'd get better results. I have some cuticle oils, so I do like the oil but I'd be interested in a balm! I'm not sure what a lemony flutter is :) As long as my hands don't feel greasy afterwards, I'm a happy kid!

And it seems to be mostly perfumes and air fresheners that bother me, but a strong scented lotion wouldn't be good.  2) Gluten... my foe. I miss bread.... and cake..... but mostly bread. So I have probably had traces of gluten in stuff and been okay (like a small amount of cross contamination), but I am pretty allergic. :-(  3) I do not have an etsy registry, but I can make one. :-)  Will have to do tonight, cause I'm swamped at work, but I will make one.  4) Renaissance is my favorite. I love British history in general, that's my area of particular interest.  5) Lets see.... husband LOVES dark chocolate and cookies (he can eat whatever he wants, lucky). Son (is also gluten free, stupid genetics, but is not as sensitive as I am) likes candy, he really likes M&M's and anything milk chocolate basically.   6) Favorite color changes. I think right now it's green, because Minecraft, but I can check with him tonight.   This is so fun! Sorry I'm allergic to so much. I feel like it makes things more difficult.  :-("

Besides, I appreciate the challenge ;)   So, scents... so lighter/not as strong scents in the vanilla/fruit/light spice (like ginger or chai) families might be ok? Hopefully I can find unscented things, too, but otherwise I can work with this :)  No worries on the Etsy registry, since I have lots of ideas for you otherwise - but really, you should probably have one for this sub anyway!"

We start walking the store looking at all kinds of stuff STAYING AWAY FROM POLISH what kind of things would waffle pick up for herself? lip balm? new scarf? coffee mug? A new print to hang on her bathroom wall?   After our shopping trip were just not ready to call it a day. We know theres some local events in town ______ (fill in event you would enjoy here) are there local vender's (say YES) what type of things would you enjoy? hand crafted goods? food? trinkets that serve no real use other then kinda fun and still impulse buy? Maybe even a new neckless?   My feet hurt but man I hear theres a new fraggle rock movie out do you wanna go see it? or were you more of a Muppet fan? are we diggin the same guy here? or am I just hoping you enjoyed these things too.

RandomActsOfPolish,3dd73s,WaffleRun,3,Wed Jul 15 11:13:07 2015 UTC,"Let's see... if I had some cash to burn and we were hanging out at the local Target I'd probably blow it on either some fun cheap socks (I'm a sucker for colorful socks or ones with images on them. I usually end up impulse buying some around the holidays) , or snacks like chips or candy (jolly ranchers, swedish fish, skittles, etc.).  Then at our city's monthly art walk (tons of local vendors!) I'm usually drawn to small art that is useful (like handmade postcards or greeting cards, or carved pencils and stuff like that) or pretty jewelry. I love handmade stuff!  Then on to the movies! Muppets or Fraggles, you can't go wrong with either (I love them both equally!). We'd have to flip a coin to decide which one to see. Or see one and then make plans to see the other later!  My knee's getting a little crampy, so we'd better pack it in. Thanks for the awesome day! Hope this helped!"

I've been having a terrible time. Couldn't sleep all day b/c I kept getting interrupted for tons of non-medical things: housekeeping, housekeeping's boss, nutrition, nutrition's boss, nutrition assistant, paperwork person, that person's boss. I was even showering and they came in to keep talking to me. NO REPRIEVE. But when it comes to medical attention, I haven't gotten what I needed. I kept saying how I was nauseous, to please bring me something. Nothing happened until a tech walked in and found me curled up on the floor ready to vomit. At that point, they put in an order for more anti nausea meds, but it took over two hours to get to me, and I vomited before then.  I thought tonight would maybe be more restful, but there's been constant banging outside my room. The nurse in charge went to investigate. It's some dude waxing the floor, banging into the walls and furniture. She asked him to stop b/c I couldn't sleep, but he said no. So, here I am, awake.  I just want to be home.  Sorry, I've been nothing but complain-town lately."

Also thrilled about how much healthier and brighter I can sound on the internet compared to my feel life image.   Quick update for those who have missed the past few dailies: On Sat 7/11 I started having back pain on my left side which didn't respond to muscle relaxers or Aleve that I took. It got worse through the night at work, until I couldn't stand up straight b/c i was doulbed over in pain, weak, dizzy, and had a fever. Still wasn't allowed to leave work (I'm an ER vet; they said doesn't matter how you feel, unless you go to the hospital, you must stay). Well, went to urgent care when I finally finished my 14 hour shift, and was diagnosed with a kidney infection and maybe stones. Tried medical management first (antibiotics, pain meds, anti-nausea). Vomited through all of that, pain got worse, and so that's how I ended up in the hospital! Which is where I am now, recieving IV versions of those things. Had a CT scan. Definitely have the infection, and multiple stones. Speaking with the urologist today to see what my plans are. At the moment my pain and nausea are much better controlled.   I don't know if you any of you have ever had a kidney infection, or known someone who did, but that shit is excruciating. And I don't say that lightly. This is from the girl who has three tats, 9 piercings, and gets bitten and scratched by animals regularly and hardly blinks an eye. So for me to even say that I hurt, let alone be doubled over, means it's really, really bad. I was screaming in pain, it hurt so much. But I'm not screaming now! That's improvement! :)"

I tend to wear silver jewelry. a simple day out is just a silver necklace if i remember but i always have studs in my ears, my nose ring, and some rings on. I love funky fun stuff but simple too. im not too picky lol.  5.  Fav polish colors gosh thats tough bc i love all my polish! lol i love  anything grey and blues/teals but im HUGE on neutrals (natural/earthy) looks right now.

I dont sell it- i just wear it and give it away to friends so i dont have any good pics and i have given a ton away already. So im adding an album for you of a couple things i did that i had out and didnt give away yet! I do all kinds of stuff i dont have one specific area i focus on, but i dabble in whatever i can. id LOVE to start trying polish jewlery though so i might be bugging you for tips etc! I mainly do beading, and just adding charms to chains or resin charms to chains (not very complicated haha!) also i just started learning to needle tat and crochet and i cant WAIT to start doing jewelry with both. thats my new obsession right now.. i added a pic of what i tatted to make earrings out of to give you an idea of what it looks like. ok im rambling ill shut up now .

I'll definitely talk crafts anytime though, and that needle tatting is super cool looking! The key is to keep trying things and you'll get better, even if you don't like what you make (like the giant bag of stuff I have with nothing to do with it lol).  Ok.

Also, my cuticles are just embarrassing in this picture.  3: I like these stripes, these dots, and this lovely ombre.   4: I wear lab gloves much of the time, so I can't/don't wear rings other than my engagement ring (which was picked with that in mind. I wear a LOT of earrings to make up for it.  5: I'm a blue and silver junkie. (As if that wasn't obvious from my monochrome picks.) I'm trying to branch out, though!"

RandomActsOfPolish,3d5833,lochnessie15,4,Mon Jul 13 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"POLISH, POLISH, AND MORE POLISH       Spreadsheet of Polishes you own? I’m almost embarrassed to post this here… but here’s my Google Doc!. Note that there’s a 2nd tab with my stamping plates, too. I have some Xiyua/other knock off plates that aren’t on there, so I’ll add those in tonight.     Can your SS include gently used polishes/items?  Yes! Definitely not a problem!     What is your current lemming? Ahh, I just squashed my biggest lemmings yesterday by getting lucky in a destash sale (Glam Polish White Witch polishes - I blame /u/secretagentkitty), but Glam Polish Entrance wasn’t available in the set - so probably that one? Oooh, or KBShimmer Laugh Myself Lily - I’ve been eyeing it for awhile now but never bought it. Or KBShimmer Men are from Marsala!      Are you in need of any tools?  I could definitely use some swatch sticks, since I'm way behind on swatching!     Five Desired Polishes/Polish Related Items? Well, I named 3 polishes up there :P I really want to pick up another Creative Shop scraper - I got one with my stamper and I love it, but it’s sad and warped out of shape. Otherwise, stamping plates? Ooh, and I’m trying to figure out a better way to organize my stamping polishes; I currently have like 40 stamping polishes sitting mixed together on a shelf, and that doesn’t work so well. Maybe better lighting, since I’m currently using a kind of crappy LED desk light that has too blue of a hue - I’ve been thinking about picking up another desk lamp and a daylight LED bulb. I’ve also played around with frankening a bit, and have some suspension base and bottles, so maybe some other glitters or pigments or spectraflair would be fun to play with?     Do you use a base coat/topcoat currently?  Yep! I kinda have a lot of indie topcoats... I normally use Bonder or Nail Envy for base coats, and I'm well stocked on those right now, too.     Favorite/ Least Favorite Polish Brand? No. I can’t just pick one. Favorite(s) include Indigo Bananas, Literary Lacquer, Chaos & Crocodiles, Octopus Party, Reverie, KBShimmer, Mentality, and Model City. As far as mainstreams go, Zoya all the way, but Ginger + Liz (available at Ulta) is awesome but a smaller brand. I’m way down the indie rabbit hole, so least favorite would probably be drugstore polishes or non-exciting mainstream polishes in general (mainstream polishes with unique colors/finishes or awesome formulas are an exception!)     What are your favorite types of polishes? Definitely holos, especially holos with extra glitter or flakes in them - something to make it a little more interesting than a normal holo. I think I’m in the beginning of a microglitter phase - I’ve been finding myself drawn toward them recently. I also love jelly/crelly polishes with ultrachrome flakes. I’m not a big fan of really textured polishes, big shaped glitters, or glitter toppers.    Most/Least Favorite Colors?  I’m a total sucker for anything blue/teal, in any shade (especially lighter shades). I appreciate a good purple on occasion, and I also love corals. Least favorite is purple-leaning pinks - they just look horrible with my skintone. Philly Loves Lacquer That Barbie is Mine! is a great example, but light purples are totally ok.     What would you love to add to your collection? I’d love to find the perfect super thin nail art brush - I still haven’t found one that actually works well consistently. Otherwise, maybe a new clean up brush, since mine isn’t in terribly good shape.      Do you use extras when doing your manicures? I’m pretty well stocked on vinyl decals/studs/etc, and don’t use them too often. I can always use more stamping plates, though!    GOODIES       Do you have any food allergies? Nope! :D     What are your favorite candies/snacks? Chocolate! Otherwise, I have a sweet tooth - anything fruity or caramel, and I love black licorice.      What types of snacks do you not like? Toffee or coffee flavored things, or anything spicy.     Do you prefer salty or sweet snacks? Generally sweet, although salty on occasion is ok - popcorn, herb-y crackers, nuts, etc.      Do you have a favorite cookie? Either chocolate chip or chocolate cookies with chocolate chips (noticing a theme here?). Although I really like ginger-y cookies, too.     What is your favorite treat? Er… chocolate? :P I also really enjoy tea - I generally drink black tea, and appreciate the ones that lean more toward spice (chai, orange cinnamon, etc).   TELL US ALL ABOUT YOU       Are you on the naughty or nice list so far this year? Ehh… my wallet thinks I’m on the naughty list, but Santa told me I’m on the nice list?     Do you prefer a few more expensive things, or lots of little things? Quality over quantity - I’d much rather have something that will last and that I’ll use.    Do you have a website or blog your Santa can peek at? No, but I’m super creative with usernames, so I’m the same name over on instagram     What is one goal you are hoping to achieve before the year ends? Ooh, that’s a tough one. Probably start to whip my butt back into shape? I lost a bunch of weight 2 years ago, and then put it all back on last year and beginning of this year, since things were super stressful. :(      What types of items would you enjoy receiving other than polish? Anything with some thought put into it, really!      Do you enjoy novelty/gag gifts? In limited quantities - I hate having to just throw something out if it’s a one-use item, but if it’s something I can keep around, that’s awesome :)     What is something you're really hoping to find in your Secret Santa package? Love! And awesome things! Ok, how about some fun packaging (doesn’t have to be pretty!) that makes opening the gift an experience? (I might regret making that statement :P)     Do you have any furbabies in your household? Yep! 2 pups - Chewie and Edie. Edie is pit bull/Australian cattle dog mix, and Chewie is a pit bull. They love ropes and things to chew on, but can destroy weaker toys quite quickly.     What do you enjoy doing outside of Reddit? Crocheting and spinning - I got a spinning wheel a few months ago, so I’ve been spinning like crazy :D (psst… if you stalk me on Etsy, I have a “Fiber Wish List”). I’ve been playing with dyeing my own fiber, too - I’ve mostly used food dyes so far, but I want to try out the professional acid dyes. I also do volunteer search and rescue stuff - like, if someone’s lost in the woods, I might get called out to go help find them and track them wherever they walked. I generally enjoy outdoorsy things.      What is your favorite scent? Vanilla, chai, honeysuckle, and berry scents, and the “peppered poppies” type scent is awesome. Not a big fan of fake-smelling fruit scents (like green apple or jolly rancher watermelon) or overwhelming “fresh” scents, like clean laundry. (I’m also totally basing all of this on cuticle oil experiences - until I started using cuticle oils, I had no clue whatsoever about scents :P)     Do you wear jewelry or have any piercings? I sometimes wear necklaces or earrings (pierced ears). I generally go for smaller stuff - small dangles, small pendants - no huge statement necklaces or anything. I don’t have any metal sensitivities, beyond the typical cheap kids rings that would turn my skin green back in the day.     Do you collect anything? Er… besides nail polish? I have a growing yarn and spinning fiber stash!      Do you have any colors/themes in your home decor? Not particularly. My husband’s family had a thing for pigs, so we’ve carried that on with kitchen gadgets. Ooh, and we totally have these pillows in our basement… For random desk things or accessories or whatever, I lean toward greens, teals, and blues.     What is your favorite animal? Not so much an animal, but I have an appreciation for anything Nessie :P      What famous person (dead/alive) you would like to meet? Erm. I’m horrible at questions like this :/ Someone awesome?     What is your favorite music artist/type? A little bit of everything - angry female country artists like Dixie Chicks or Miranda Lambert, generic pop, Taylor Swift, random joke artists like Garfunkle & Oates or Lonley Island… I’m not too picky. I stay away from classical, bluegrass, really twangy country, hardcore rap, heavy metal stuff, etc.      What are you favorite stores to shop at? Does Amazon count? :P Otherwise, Target, Ulta, and sometimes Michaels or JoAnns, or home improvement stores if I’m in the right mood ‘cause I’m a nerd like that.     Do you have a favorite Sports Team/Athlete? No, I don’t really follow sports much     Do you have a favorite celebrity? I’m horribly out of the loop. I recognize names, or I recognize faces, but I can’t put them together when it comes to celebrities.     What is one place you would like to visit? Awesome national parks out west - I’ve been to Zion and the Grand Canyon, but I’d love to get up to Yellowstone or Arches or Bryce - so much exploring. Otherwise, I’d love to visit Europe!     Favorite magazines you do not subscribe to? I don’t currently subscribe to any magazines. If I did, I’d probably hunt down spinning or crocheting magazines. However, I definitely enjoy a Cosmo on occasion when I’m traveling.      What is your favorite TV show? Hmm… Of the ones I’ve watched through, maybe How I Met Your Mother, Firefly, Dexter, or Lost? I’m indecisive :P     Anything else your SS should know about you? <3 you! Also, please stalk me!"

RandomActsOfPolish,3d5833,frankiecat_,4,Wed Jul 15 17:09:08 2015 UTC,"Do you have a Pinterest Board/Spreadsheet of Polishes you own? Link? Updated list here!  Can your SS include gently used polishes/items? YES! I'm always down to rehome some polish babies. GIVE ME YOUR UNWANTED SPAWN.  What is your current lemming? (Most wanted polish) It's more like three, the GOOSEBUMPS collection from Mckfresh Nail Attire!  I already have Horrorland. So I'm keen for Vampire Breath, Be Careful What You Wish For, Camp Nightmare and Dead House! Edit: I ALMOST TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THE GRACEFULL NAIL POLISH 'ICE PRINCESS' COLLECTION!!!   Are you in need of any tools? (Dotting tools, Cuticle nippers, etc) Ugh, yes. I need a new clean up brush and a cuticle pusher thingy.  Five Desired Polishes/Polish Related Items? Could definitely do with some more holos! Glitters toppers! Stamping plates with cute af design etc.  Do you use a base coat/topcoat currently? Yep. Current base coat is Sally Hansen 'Nail Rehab' and my top coat is Sally Hansen 'Big Shiny Topcoat'. But that topcoat is pissing me off and I'm currently trying to find a new one.  Favorite/ Least Favorite Polish Brand? EMILY de MOLLY IS MY FAVOURITE! Seriously, I can't even deal. And also Pretty Serious is fab too! I don't really have any least favourites either, woo!!  What are your favorite types of polishes? (Holo, Glitter, Textured, etc) I love me a good holo! Microglitter is also pretty great. OH! Also, I'm a huge fan of colour shifting flakies! They make any polish look fabulous.  Most/Least Favorite Colors? I don't think I've told any of you, but my favourite colour is purple. Like, I don't even notice I'm buying the damn colour anymore. What's that? There's other colours? Whoop no, gonna gravitate to that purple instead. ""Don't you have one like that already?"" I hear from my SO. ""Why no, no I don't. It's a slightly darker shade of SHUT THE HELL UP AND LET ME BUY IT"" So, purple. And I've started loving blues and pastel colours. I don't really have a least favourite colour..  What would you love to add to your collection? (Jellys, Cremes, Mattes, Dotting Tools, Gemstones, ect) JELLIES! And more mattes, definitely. Even just a matte topcoat would work. Then EVERYTHING COULD BE MATTE! Also, nail vinyls are a huge thing for me right now. Like, holy shit I want them all.  Do you use extras such as nail decals,gemstones,studs, ect when doing your manicures? I've got some stickers I use sometimes,  but other than that it's just a vinyl stencil or striping tape. I'd love to try some bling though, they can look so pretty! And I keep putting off using the water decals that the Sheep of Wonders got me, because they're so precious!  GOODIES Do you have any food allergies? Unless you're planning to send me mouldy food, then no. I don't want your penicillin infested food. Although, if it's a cupcake, I'd probably eat around it.  What are your favorite candies/snacks? LOLLY GOBBLE BLISS BOMBS, OH MY FUCK. Seriously. Burnt sugar, caramel coated popcorn... Yes please! I do love anything with coconut or cherry too.

Also, I'm not a huge fan of things with peanuts.  Do you prefer salty or sweet snacks? SALTED CARAMEL SNACKS. Best of both worlds. Seriously though, I'm keen for either.  Do you have a favorite cookie? As in like chocolate chip cookie? Or like a biscuit, as in Tim Tams? Let's roll with that and I'm gonna say Tim Tams. OR if you actually mean cookies, I LOVE ME A SOFT AND CHEWY COOKIE.  What is your favorite treat? Hmmm I dunno Davey. It's hard to think about these things, because when I try to think about them, I forget. CHEESECAKE! I love cheesecake, holy shit how did I forget that.  TELL US ALL ABOUT YOU Are you on the naughty or nice list so far this year? Lol, you're funny.  Do you prefer a few more expensive things, or lots of little things? LOTS OF LITTLE THINGS! Seriously, getting a whole lot of little things is much more exciting for me than a few expensive things. In my warped little mind, I feel like I win more.  Do you have a website or blog your Santa can peek at? I have instagram (@kristinelouise), which is all I use on the reg. Had a tumblr, but it's full of half naked bitches with tattoos and cats. OH!

We've got 3 cats, a Beagle, a rabbit and some fish.  What do you enjoy doing outside of Reddit? Playing ps4 games with my SO. We're currently playing Borderlands 2 and I'm in love with Moxxy.

(Dotting tools, Cuticle nippers, etc) Noooo please no lol! I have a bunch :)  Five Desired Polishes/Polish Related Items? Forever stamping plates or good stamping polishes! Though I understand shipping for that might be ridiculously close so if not that is a-okay. I really need good, solid base colors. I don’t own any grey polishes, for example.

I don’t really need glitters (I dont use them often) but if there's one you think I must have feel free! My wishlist would be best for desired items instead of me just pulling stuff out of my ass rn tbh.   Do you use a base coat/topcoat currently?

I’d rather not do textured/glitters unless you find one you think I MUST HAVE. (Or gently used that need rehoming is okay too - I'm not going to be picky about that at all) I'd love some good stamping polishes (Im positive the specific ones wouldn't get here in time though) but any really opaque solid colors would be great.  Most/Least Favorite Colors? My favorite colors are purples and blues (of which I have a few each so up to you if you think I need more) and least favorite is yellow.

Or a cute shirt/bag/jewelry. No bath bombs though, our bathtub switcher thing just broke :( Oh any hair products that are CG friendly - I've been dying to try devacurl stuff but its super expensive, I think they have little travel sizes at ULTA? Not positive. I've been enjoying the Shea Moisture line. This can get super specific though because hair is difficult, so please ask me specifics about hair products beforehand (even in Shea Moisture's line there are certain products my hair doesnt like - specifically the shea butter ones)! Oh also fun, cute things for my desk at work - I have a huge desk and barely anything on it!   Do you enjoy novelty/gag gifts? Sure, within reasonable bounds if it'll make my santa happy.

I guess Em Watson? Im not huge on celebs really.   What is one place you would like to visit? Most definitely NYC in the US. Internationally? Probably Italy, France, or Greece.

(Cant believe I forgot this first time around), etc etc  Anything else your SS should know about you? Umm I can’t use Moyou’s regular sized stamping plates very easily anymore because they are too small, XL-sized images are best (Messy mansion sizes are okay too). I’d love to try one of those awesome creative shop stampers if you happen to have an extra and are willing to rehome it if not they’re like ridic to get so don’t worry about it (and if you have one but dont want to give it away i totally understand!!!). I love all things harry potter. If you have any books you wanna send my way I love fantasy books! I’d really love some holos/unique indies or bright/pretty base colors like I mentioned and stamping plates or polishes are always welcome. I play PC games so anything through Steam is fair game. I am on a diet but willing to make an exception for any treats you send my way!! If I wasn’t specific enough please make an alt acct and ask me any more questions or areas to be specific about okay I love u bye"

I’m a pretty open person with a great sense of humour :) I also have difficulty answering surveys."
RandomActsOfPolish,3d5833,unlodgical,3,Mon Jul 13 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"Do you have a Pinterest Board/Spreadsheet of Polishes you own? Link?   -I doooo! For the most part, ish. Santa, pretty please message me and I'll send it over!   Can your SS include gently used polishes/items? - YES! Of course, of course, of course! Every polish needs a good home! This is also an AWESOME way to give me a taste of something at a cheaper price. ;) I'm all about saving you dat money, girlllll. <3  What is your current lemming? (Most wanted polish)   I don't have JUST ONE lemming. I have like, a thousand million bajillion. And maybe not even colors that I can think of right this very second, but more like brands and hues and stuff! Wherever you are beautiful Santa, I promise to come update this as I start drooling over polishes. <3333   Are you in need of any tools? (Dotting tools, Cuticle nippers, etc)   I can always use a brand new pack of those KICK ASS cuticle clean up brushes that I posted, and emery boards that are made for beastly talons. Seriously, gimme dat grit. These bitches are LONG. OHOOHOHOHO, If you can find square/flat ended clippers I WILL KISS YOUR FACE. Not that I wasn't going to anyways...    Five Desired Polishes/Polish Related Items?   I'll be right back! I need to go find my happiness! I think this will end up being more brand-y than specifics, maybe. Like Glam polishes (WHICH I WANT WITH EVERY FIBER IN MY BODY), or some EP, or Cupcakes, or Emilys, or C&C, or Crowtoes, or FUN, or Octopus, or Arcane, or like an A ENGLAND?! OR LLAROWE?!?! What about like stamping polishes!? OR PLATES WITH LACE AND FLOWERS AND PRETTY THINGS?! Or stampers? Or latex? Or everything!   Do you use a base coat/topcoat currently?   YASSSSSS! I am a nail envy FIEND, and love all the top coats! Currently digging my KBShimmer, H&K Girl, and Poshe. OH BABY, SEAL ME UP.    Favorite/ Least Favorite Polish Brand?   I can't dislike any polish, so there's that. I don't prefer drugstores always, and I've had some bad luck with LynB and Essie. My favorites... GLAM POLISHES ARE GORGEOUS! And KBShimmers are always stunners. And llarowes holos, OMG. Tend to also love all indies! And ILNP! I really am not picky though, for real. How about my favorite is anything pretty, or gorgeous?   What are your favorite types of polishes? (Holo, Glitter, Textured, etc)    Strong holos make me weak in the knees, as do crellies and crelly/jelly mixes! Cremes are always welcome! Chromes, shifters, I'll take it all. I think the only thing I would rather stay away from is textures because I have to top coat my nails like a mad man.    Most/Least Favorite Colors?   Basically I'm having an identity crisis and am starting to love EVERYTHING, except greens still (but don't tell Omni). My absolute FAVORITES are pinks, peaches, salmons, burgundys, pinks, pinks, lilacs, those pretty cornflower blues, pinks, did I mention pinks?! I don't find myself rocking darker colors yet but that's because Florida. I think any color can come in a pretty shade! I'm super easily impressed!    What would you love to add to your collection? (Jellys, Cremes, Mattes, Dotting Tools, Gemstones, ect)    HOLOSSSSS!!!! I would LOVE polishes that have a stunning finish without too much fuss. Big girl job world means I have to impress any way I can, so multi chromes that aren't green are what I mean. Or insanely sparkly! Also, those jelly crelly looking polishes with SEXY ASS depth and elements are PERF! <3333 I would just love to try some brands I haven't been able to! So like, any idea not on my owned list, especially anything from overseas or like Bigcartel? OR SHARE WITH ME YOUR FAVORITE INDIE BRAND!?! I also would love to add more stamping plates! I want pretttttty things! Flowers, feminine, laces, patterns! I am sooooo after negative spacing kind of designs! Does that make sense? Like, lots of the under color that shows through and stuff!    Do you use extras such as nail decals,gemstones,studs, ect when doing your manicures?    I use extras like cuticle oils, cuticle dissolvers, mani bombs, stuff like that! My hands get a beating, so I rarely can put stuff on them. :( HOLY SHIT I LIED JUST KIDDING. Decals. FUCKING LOVE ME SOME DECALS. Chervons, swirls, tribal patterns. GIMME DEM DECALS BB! <333   GOODIES  Do you have any food allergies?   HELLLLLLLLLS TO THE NO! I eat everything, always.    What are your favorite candies/snacks?   I LOVE salty stuff and sweet stuff. Like those caramel bugles are MY SHIT. I take trail mix to the face like a boss. Gummy candy makes my belly happy, and peanut butter is fucking delicious. Raisins are bad ass too, and pickles and shit. Like sour stuff! And CHEESE. OMG CHEESE. I could eat cheese on cheese 3 times a day! I'm okay with a little chocolate, but mostly those delicious milk chocolate melty truffles. Swoon.    What types of snacks do you not like?   Lolz, yeah right. The kind that's not edible?   Do you prefer salty or sweet snacks?   Both! Even better when it's BOTH both! Unfffff. <333 Think peanut butter and fluff, or something.    Do you have a favorite cookie?   YES! The kind I can put in my fat face and munch on! :3    What is your favorite treat?   Any kind that can be eaten! I would LOVE snacks to hide at my desk. Anything from candy to poptarts. OMG cinnamon poptarts.    TELL US ALL ABOUT YOU  Are you on the naughty or nice list so far this year?   I AM NAUGHTY AS FUCK. But in the nice kind of way. Like, I'll take you out to a nice seafood dinner then touch your boob, hard.    Do you prefer a few more expensive things, or lots of little things?   I would be happy either way! I am SO grateful for anything (literally), and I promise my child like brain will light up either way! <3333 You just being you is more than enough! <3   Do you have a website or blog your Santa can peek at?   I'm not cool enough for that. :(    What is one goal you are hoping to achieve before the year ends?   I HAVE NO IDEA, THANKS FOR REMINDING ME I HAVE NO AMBITIONS. :( Maybe to stay happy?!

I love rehoming polishes. :)  What is your current lemming? (Most wanted polish) I don't have one anymore, as I recently acquired mine. But anything off my wish list is fair game!

Link? https://www.pinterest.com/starregazer/nail-polishes-i-own/ I only have my indies listed so far as I just started that board.

Can be pretty much any design. I have my ears pierced but prefer to wear only studs/small earrings.  Do you collect anything? I am such a big pack rack, I’m trying to be better.

Cats, even though I’m allergic. I also love big cats and pandas!  What famous person (dead/alive) you would like to meet? Hmm… that’s a tough one. I worry that most famous people would end up being not what I expect in person. That being said. I’d love to meet Dave Grohl, Brandon Boyd and Jensen Ackles.  What is your favorite music artist/type? I listen to mostly Rock and Alternative. My fav bands are Foo Fighters, Incubus, Dance Hall Crashers, Green Day, Paramore and Halestorm.

Ones that no longer air but I'm a huge fan of... Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Roswell and Veronica Mars. Those are shows I can rewatch over and over. That’s not even a fraction of what I watch, that’s why I’m always behind. Did I mention that my SO and I met because of TV?  Anything else your SS should know about you? I love to travel. It helps that my SO is from Vienna, Austria so I’m able to travel to Europe now a bit easier. He’s actually from Italy, so I’ve been to Italy, not just my dream places… yet! I LOVE NYC. It’s pretty much my favorite place in the world. I’m so glad I’m less than a 2 hour drive from it. I love going to concerts and love listening to music. I’ve been to probably over 60 concerts. I love Broadway, probably helps with my love of NYC. I am still new to indie polishes. Just started getting them once I joined this sub back in Feb. I have always painted my nails, but since I joined here my polish collection has been increasing. As I said before, I watch too much tv. I am kinda boring and don’t do much else when I’m at home, besides reading (I read 34 books last year, I’ve read less than 10 this year, so behind!) I’m not very domesticated, so I don’t really cook or bake and I don’t know how to knit or do anything crafty.  I hope I was detailed enough, this is my first time doing this. Feel free to ask me any questions!"

RandomActsOfPolish,3d5833,silentwail,2,Wed Jul 15 23:49:47 2015 UTC,"POLISH, POLISH, AND MORE POLISH  Do you have a Pinterest Board/Spreadsheet of Polishes you own? Link? I've still got a few polishes to add, but here is my spreadsheet  Can your SS include gently used polishes/items? Absolutely!   What is your current lemming? (Most wanted polish) I have 2 that are most likely unobtainable, but I would die for Ugly Sweater Party by Wonder Beauty Products or Playa by The Lady Varnishes. I added them to my wish list so long ago only to watch them go unavailable within days, never to return.  Are you in need of any tools? (Dotting tools, Cuticle nippers, etc) Cuticle nippers (not the scissor kind) are actually something I could really use. Mine are dull.  Five Desired Polishes/Polish Related Items? I'm desperately in need of more swatch sticks (the cheapy clear ones I have in my amazon wishlist) ... I'm so far behind because they come from China and my last order for last in the mail and 3 months later I'm still waiting for the second shipment to arrive. I would also love more stampers/heads. I have 3 I really like (each a different style/brand) but I've been doing more reverse stamping and to be able to do more than 3 at a time would be awesome. I don't have huge nails so I don't need anything gigantic like the Creative Shop stamper. Though I would also love to try that one.  Do you use a base coat/topcoat currently? I am a fan girl for Poshe but I've always wanted to try HK Girl. Or if you have a favorite I'd love to expand my choices (other than Seche Vite... It didn't agree with me)  Favorite/Least Favorite Polish Brand? No particular favorite, but I'm not picky about brands at all. I will get use out of everything!  What are your favorite types of polishes? (Holo, Glitter, Textured, etc) Love jelly glitters (think KBShimmer Green Hex & Glam) and suddenly addicted to holos (Color Clubs are fantastic!) but textured polishes get caught in my hair and drive me insane. Also, I'm lusting over so many stamping polishes these days. The set I recently got from Jolie Polish is great but I would love more cremes.  Most/Least Favorite Colors? I'm trying not to have favorites for colors because I've noticed I have far more blues and purples than everything else. So I really just want every color under the sun.  What would you love to add to your collection? (Jellys, Cremes, Mattes, Dotting Tools, Gemstones, ect) I'm really wanting to try the OPI Matte topcoat.  Do you use extras such as nail decals,gemstones,studs, ect when doing your manicures? I do use all of those but I've got so many currently that I'm a little overwhelmed (I have a hard time making decisions)  GOODIES  Do you have any food allergies? So many stupid allergies. 😑 Nothing that will kill me but soy is a big one I really make sure to avoid. In small doses is OK but I still try to stay away from it.  What are your favorite candies/snacks? I love sour/chewy candies like Skittles and Sprees. And Nerds... Mmm.  I also really love things like roasted beet chips and Plentils.  What types of snacks do you not like? Not big on super sweet things or anything with marshmallow  Do you prefer salty or sweet snacks? Salty  Do you have a favorite cookie? Lemon cranberry is my favorite of the cookies I make, but in general in not real big on sweets  TELL US ALL ABOUT YOU  Are you on the naughty or nice list so far this year? Definitely the nice list. I'm too busy to be naughty!  Do you prefer a few more expensive things, or lots of little things? I'm perfectly pleased either way. 😊  Do you have a website or blog your Santa can peek at? No,  sorry. I don't have the time or patience to keep up with things like that.  What is one goal you are hoping to achieve before the year ends? Take some vacation time! Not really to do anything in particular, just to rest my brain.  What types of items would you enjoy receiving other than polish? Stamping plates,  stampers/heads, cuticle oils!  Do you enjoy novelty/gag gifts? It depends on the nature of the gag. But in general, nah.  What is something you're really hoping to find in your Secret Santa package? Anything! I love exchanges and I am never disappointed with gifts that show someone really tried to ""get"" me.  Do you have any furbabies in your household? Yes and they're all spoiled rotten! I have 2 cats and a dog.  What do you enjoy doing outside of Reddit? My nails, for one...being active with the dog at the park or playing fetch in the back yard. Other than that I just work a lot.  What is your favorite scent? I'm allergic to perfumes and flowers so my favorite scents are things like pumpkin spice (particularly clove and cinnamon) or coconut, orange or other citrusy smells.  Do you wear jewelry or have any piercings? I do, but once again I have allergies to metals so I have to wear only sterling silver, titanium or white gold. 😐  Do you collect anything? Elephant items. But not the Indian style elephants... African all the way! 🐘  Do you have any colors/themes in your home decor? Oh lord my house is insane with colors. Every color except red is in this place.  What is your favorite animal? elephants, cats, dogs, fish... No favorite  What famous person (dead/alive) you would like to meet? This is hard for me to answer because I'm not very up on famous people, new or old.  What is your favorite music artist/type? I like all music! Seriously, my playlists are crazy. I could never pick a favorite.  What are you favorite stores to shop at? I don't shop very much but I do seem to gravitate towards Bed Bath & Beyond and Kohls or places like Ross and Home Goods.  Do you have a favorite Sports Team/Athlete? Not even remotely  Do you have a favorite celebrity? Nope  What is one place you would like to visit? Slovenia!  Favorite magazines you do not subscribe to? None  What is your favorite TV show? I don't watch a lot of TV. There are a few shows I enjoy but I never keep up with anything enough to be able to hold a conversation about it.  Anything else your SS should know about you? I can't wait! I hope you don't find me too boring to shop for!"

I keep seeing pictures pop up from them on FB and have to stare for a few seconds (most recently being Captive Goddess)  Are you in need of any tools?

Do you enjoy novelty/gag gifts? Depends really, if its overly silly / derpy then not so much. Ive got enough stuff taking over my desk area atm so space is limited hehe.

Nope  What do you enjoy doing outside of Reddit?

According to whatever website that includes     Heart notes - Charming, feminine middle note with black violet, cocoa flower Top notes - Audacious and sparkling top note with pink pepper berries, cranberry Base notes - Addictive and passionate base note with patchouli and black vanilla   So those kinda smells I guess.

No idea  What is your favorite music artist/type? I am mainly a fan of whatever name we are calling the more rocky style of music nowadays.

Mainly because a lot of it has a really good beat for the gym  What are you favorite stores to shop at? Next, New Look, Dorothy Perkins and Long Tall Sally for clothes (shops don't generally stock long enough trousers for me :P ) Superdrug, TKMAXX and boots for polish swag Online, I like to use nail polish direct as its pretty good price wise - cheaper than retail (even for A-england polishes oddly.....) plus, we can actually get Zoya from them too :)  Do you have a favorite Sports Team/Athlete? Thanks to my boyfriend, I've joined in the enjoyment of watching American Foootball and this is a Patriots household :p ( I have  a mini funko Gronk sitting on my desk with me -  silly giant puppy man, such cute ) Otherwise...not really  Do you have a favorite celebrity? Not particularly. Or atleast that I can think of right now.  What is one place you would like to visit? Anywhere really. I've been to St Lucia, Greece, France and New York.

What is your favorite TV show? Loved watching Daredevil. Also like watching Brooklyn 99, Big Bang Theory (even if it's rather stale), How I met your mother and other easy stuff I can just chuck on TV. I really do need to get my butt in gear and finish watching true blood. I stopped after series 2 because I was reading the books and went meh its too different WAHWAHWAH type of BS. Then I grew up and realised tv adaptations are just that... adaptations of the books. And I finally finished the books on holiday ( final book was goddamn awful.... :( )  Anything else your SS should know about you? Oh my...... What does Santa wish to know? :p I am awful at talking about myself so you may have to ask.....sorry! I suppose I can list mani extras I own.

I have nail art brushes and dotting tools I have swatch sticks    But If I have missed something useful, or even if you want to ask me questions to be tricksy, then go ahead :)"

Favorite: A tie between BL and Zoya. Least Favorite: Essie, OPI, Sinful Colors, and most drugstore brands (not because of quality, but because I only buy vegan and cruelty-free polishes)  What are your favorite types of polishes?

I'd be open to trying some other decals.  GOODIES  Do you have any food allergies? I'm vegan, so I don't use or eat animal products (no meat, eggs, dairy, honey), but my husband is vegetarian, so don't worry if you throw in some snacks that end up having eggs, dairy, or honey in them because he'll happily eat them. Here's a helpful list of vegan foods - like Skittles, Oreos, Fritos, etc., if you decide to throw in some snacks (but don't feel like you have to! I know the vegan thing scares a lot of people, so it's all good).  What are your favorite candies/snacks? Anything except black licorice.   Do you prefer salty or sweet snacks? I like them equally!

Busted my knee awhile ago and have been having issues with more than a mile or two (even though I used to run long-distance), so I've been doing knee exercises and am going to a physical therapist at the end of the month.  What types of items would you enjoy receiving other than polish? Cat toys. I love my two kitties.  Do you enjoy novelty/gag gifts? They can be fun.  What is something you're really hoping to find in your Secret Santa package? Just looking for some fun, new polish!  Do you have any furbabies in your household? 2 lovely adopted cats.  What do you enjoy doing outside of Reddit? Reading, running (*sigh), and laughing.  What is your favorite scent? Vanilla or coconut.  Do you wear jewelry or have any piercings?

(now I don't care and will wear anything. but that's beside the point.)   I found a lot of guides and stuff like this were very helpful. You have to kind of know your undertones and some color theory. A lot of it can be found with a google search, or sometimes companies are very helpful and will put like, ""this lipstick is a creamy blue-red"" or ""orange-red"" on their site. when you shop for NYX on Ulta's site they do that type of descriptions with most lipsticks.  Zoya will say if something is warmer or cooler, which is also helpful."

The base color on all fingers is @yumelacquer Courageous Thunder. The silver is Melrose Place by @cultcosmetics. The pink rose is Malibu also by Cult Cosmetics.

My husband and I are going to a hotel tonight for some time to ourselves. Yay!   Does anyone else feel like waiting for the question thread for the summer exchange is torture? Maybe not torture...... But I'm so excited about the exchange and I've always had an issue with patience. Lol   Have a great day everyone!

RandomActsOfPolish,3cowr7,sexygingerbear,2,Thu Jul 9 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Lots and lots of practice and patience! One tip I can give is to have at least 6-7 rings (drops of polish) because the outer 2-3 rings dry fast so you can really only use the inner rings for your design. If you try and drag through the outer, dry rings it messes up the whole thing. It takes a lot of polish so I just used LA colors from the dollar store for this mani. http://imgur.com/EEYlRe8 This is the mani is progress.

Was lucky enough to happen to get sick about half an hour before my SO finished work, so I thought I'd catch the tram down to his work and go home with him.  About half way on my journey the driver tells us there's been an accident on the tram tracks and he's not sure how long it'll be till it's cleared up. Looked out the window and sure enough, a car had been hit in the drives side by a tram a little further down the road.  I don't know about you guys and your trams (or are they trolley cars, I still don't even know) but getting hit by our trams is like getting hit by a rhino on a skateboard. or 30.  Ugh.

RandomActsOfPolish,3cn753,brouw3r4,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:22:39 2015 UTC,"I am very similar, long time nail biter but take good care of my nails. I find that instead of biting my nails I've replaced it with another habit, pushing my cuticles back. I think that part of the problem is having something to do with your hands. So throughout the day almost obsessively I push my cuticles back. Also at night I use cuticle oil (sometimes... If I can remember too). When you use the nail envy how long are you leaving it on? Are you following the  directions on the back? My tip for you to help stop biting and to help with your nails is always have something on them. Whether its Nail Envy or polish, just keep though puppies covered. If they are majorly chipping put on new polish asap. I find for me that when my polish chips I'm more likely to bite. Good luck!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3cn753,Ihatejellybeans1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"I use cuticle oil compulsively. A lot of cuticle oils don't have a great taste to them, so that helps to deter me from biting them, too :)   I also try to always keep a small nail file around - one in my purse, on my work desk, on my home desk, etc. If I end up with a small snag or imperfection at the end of my nails, then I'm likely to pick/bite at them - but if I file them, I can smooth things out and I'm good to go.  I also keep polish on all the time, and repaint them as soon as they start to chip! If it starts to chip, then I'm terrible about picking at my polish!"

I was never a nail biter but I always bit the skin by my nails and cuticles and stuff. I use an E&A cuticle oil (peppermint is awesome) and push them back whenever I'm thinking about it. It's totally fine to have polish on while you are using oil!! I would maybe wipe your nails off with a paper towel after using oil if you are about to polish, but you can also apply oil while you have polish on!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3cn753,chef_boyceardee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"It's officially been a year since I stopped biting my nails and began caring how they looked.   First things first. Stop going to the nail salon. I don't know if you do, but getting acrylics and powder nails is NOT helpful, and is very damaging to your nails.  I started out with Nail Tek II (Intensive Therapy) treatment as a base coat. You can get this at your beauty supply store (Sally's, nail suppliers, etc). I also applied Nail Tek III (Renew) which is a cuticle oil that smells like peppermint.   Keep your nails painted. Always. If they start to chip, redo the nail or just do a new mani. I'm lucky enough to be one of those people who was able to force myself to stop, cold turkey. When I'd ""relapse"" and ruin a nail, the overwhelming disappointment I had for myself was enough of a reason to stop doing it.  When you reach milestones of not biting your nails, just get yourself a new polish or something of the like. That way, you'll have stuff to look forward to :3  Follow the ladies on this sub. I remember how much I wanted to have long nails like theirs, how I thought I never would. When I finally did achieve nails longer than my finger, it was an amazing feeling. You can totally go look at my Instagram and see my progress (@thepolished.pirate). I recently had a nail break, tho :<  As for your cuticles, I didn't really push them back a lot. You should NEVER cut or trim them. If you do, you could damage the living part of your nail, causing a really awful-looking disorder called ""nail pterygium."" Yuck. And, the worst part is, you can't really fix it. It's scar tissue, and you can't make it go away. So, NEVER, EVER, EVER cut your living tissues. If you go to nail salons and they whip out those big nippers, tell them no. The majority of the time, they aren't using those things correctly.  If you have any other questions, feel free to message me! I'm in the cosmetology and nail program at school, so I understand quite a bit about this stuffs :3"

It isnt as 'squishy' as the pueen one but it isnt stiff that you would have to roll the image on the nail. you can still just press it on the nail and it comes out fine for me. i see it sold alot in different shops on etsy and amazon, i guess its a generic sort of cheap squishy stamper lol.  so yea i use those and love them. i havent gotten to try any of the nicer ones but i have to say im happy with these. especially the pueen one just bc it really is so squishy."

I have so many untrieds that if I don't do my nails as often as I do I'd never get through them. I still probably will never get through them, but I also get bored of the same design after a day or two."

RandomActsOfPolish,3cg7to,ifeelitwaiting,2,Tue Jul 7 21:41:27 2015 UTC,I tend to do mine once or twice a week. Generally whenever they start to chip. Sometimes I'll do them more if I have an event I want to match my nails for. :)
RandomActsOfPolish,3cg7to,lerin,2,Tue Jul 7 20:36:43 2015 UTC,"I usually do mine 2-3 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less."

RandomActsOfPolish,3cg7to,katja31,2,Tue Jul 7 21:09:17 2015 UTC,I paint my nails two or three times a week! I have the opposite problem where I feel bad that i'm not using all my nail polish so I try to do them often :)
RandomActsOfPolish,3cg7to,A_Sexy_Muffin,2,Tue Jul 7 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"When I don't have a set of acrylics on, I paint my nails once or twice a week(depending on if it chipped the first manicure). I do not like my nails to be chipped at all and would rather have no polish than a chipped manicure.  When I'm doing my acrylics, I will change my polish or just repaint them the same colour up every 2 weeks after doing an infill. :x"

Unless I'm swatching and then I paint them multiple times that day. I have an ashamedly large collection so I feel like I need to paint my nails more to make sure they all get loved."
RandomActsOfPolish,3cg7to,cupcake1713,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:26:13 2015 UTC,I generally paint them two or three times a week depending on how much I like the design. Sometimes if I'm feeling fidgety I'll paint 'em four times.

RandomActsOfPolish,3cg7to,PirateShiplol,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:46:24 2015 UTC,"If I do a simple mani with just glitter/stamping on top, I'll usually do them again later that week. If I do a super intricate design (see Solar System nails), I'll wait until it chips on at least two nails. I wore those for about two weeks before they started to chip. I can make a mani nearly chip-proof if I want it to last."

RandomActsOfPolish,3cg7to,batdalek,0,Tue Jul 7 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"I do my nails almost daily. I'm a stay at home mom/full time student so at night once the kiddo goes to sleep I'll sit down, take my polish off, listen to my school lecture, and do my nails. I think I enjoy the process of finding the design and colors and applying it, then I enjoy actually having polished nails."
RandomActsOfPolish,3cgk3u,jacks_night_mare,3,Tue Jul 7 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"Before I got a stamper I couldn't do the actual reverse stamp on i would stamp the image on to a plastic bag and then color it in. Top with a clear top coat then remove when dry and place on your nails like a sticker. 😊 Now I use the stamper I got with a Cici & Sisi stamping set. But either way works fine except the plastic bag method takes more patience waiting for the ""decal"" to dry do you can peel it without distorting it."

RandomActsOfPolish,3cgk3u,missus_b,2,Tue Jul 7 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"Do you mean you left dents with tweezers trying to peel it up? That will happen pretty much regardless of what stamper you use. I started using the flat edge of a cuticle pusher or like the side of my tweezers (not the point) to get the edge of the stamping decal lifted off the stamper, then I use the point of my tweezers to finish peeling."
RandomActsOfPolish,3cgk3u,missus_b,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:03:53 2015 UTC,Yes. I was  curious if it will eventually ruin my stamper and cause my stamps to not turn out well. Do you recommend getting another stamper to designate its to reverses?
RandomActsOfPolish,3cgk3u,missus_b,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:31 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think it's necessary. I recommend just finding a way to remove your stamping decals using a tool that won't dent your stamper (suggestions in my above comment). I have some minor dents in some of my stampers but they do not affect the quality of my stamps (stamping decals or regular stamping)."

I'm sure I'm not moving fast enough and it's all drying so quickly but I don't know how to work any faster if I can't get the stupid polish off the brush. Grrr!
RandomActsOfPolish,3cctb9,az2oh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:16:50 2015 UTC,Omg seriously it drove me insane! It would not drip off lol and I tried a ridiculous amount of polish you don't even know. I couldn't even attempt a design bc the polish would dry.it was weird though bc like I wanted to try to go fast but the drips wouldnt really expand fast so if I went quick it wouldn't spread I was just doing it over the last color.hard to explain but it was interesting! I see all these other amazing designs and I'm like how do they even?! Wtfff haha needless to say I feel your frustration on it not doing what you want it to!

I was just so hopeful that doing the decal instead of dipping would help make it easier but it didn't :-( I watch tutorial vids and they do like 15 rings of colors or more and I can't get anymore than like 4 before the polish stops spreading and I'm working with a teeny tiny little circle. I'm sure if I kept at it I could figure out the issue but eh, I don't think I wanna lol"

I'm the same with doing something till I'm good at it but honestly I just don't like water marble lol. If it was something that pleased me aesthetically I would totally keep at it.

RandomActsOfPolish,3cc6b2,lynlyn6,3,Mon Jul 6 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"Some people, like myself, just have a chemistry that polish seems to peel off. Think its oily nail beds. Are you cleaning your nails before wearing polish? With alcohol or acetone, or something? Make sure you don't put the oil on right before you paint your nails."
RandomActsOfPolish,3cc6b2,dnd1980,2,Mon Jul 6 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"I tend to apply oil, then wait several hours (and likely a couple hand-washings, just due to daily activities) before polishing.

At like 3 yesterday afternoon I decided Derek needed to upgrade from his toddler bed (which has a crib sized mattress) to a twin sized bed. And I didn't want to get him a box spring, I wanted him to have a platform bed. And because I am awfully impatient I didn't want to order stuff and wait for it to arrive, so I went out and bought him the mattress and platform bed. Husband and I moved tons of stuff out of our room and into the loft area so the kiddo can have his own part of the room (remember, since we moved in with my dad we have the master room and loft for our stuff). I put together his bed since husband isn't very good at that. But now that it's all done and together he loves his ""big boy bed"". Pictures."

RandomActsOfPolish,3c8xd2,itsok_imapirate,2,Mon Jul 6 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of firm stampers because I find that it makes the curve of my nail hard to manage. If you're getting a distorted image, try lightening your touch when you pick up, and use a bit of a rolling motion when you place. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people don't like really firm stampers, so Konad is the only one...I've only ever seen one other advertised as firm. But it was a nameless/brandless rectangle stamper from eBay. Messy Mansion has a variety of softness options too, but I've only ever tried their softer ones.   My favorite is the Creative Shop stamper, which I would qualify as squishy, but not the softest, and a sort of translucent/creamy color. I've never had a problem seeing white polish on it. There's a knock-off now, the GP Stamper, which comes in many colors. Though I believe you can only order through Facebook at the moment. I have a few on the way, I'll let you know how they work out."

RandomActsOfPolish,3c6c01,BlueSprite714,2,Sun Jul 5 16:23:12 2015 UTC,Does pretty much any polish work? You just need a light hand so not to smear the stamp?

RandomActsOfPolish,3c1pw0,chef_boyceardee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:37:26 2015 UTC,You are too cute. It's not any harder than a regular gradient. Just I guess experiment with how big to make your circles to make sure you cover the whole nail. My issue is getting enough of the middle color since the outer color seems to always dominate.

So I spent the afternoon wallowing in my pity. It got better though. I made some buffalo chicken quesadillas tonight. It was super easy and basically all leftovers! I hardly use leftovers but this was a great way to use up some chicken and tortillas.  Broke down and did a fourth of July mani. I wanted to keep the one from the contest on because I really loved it. However my index fingers chipped a bit so I figured I should use it as a reason to make a patriotic mani.  Also ended up walking around Target with Jeremy and we laid down after and watched some stand up. It was a good time. Got a cookout and some fireworks tomorrow!! So today turned out good. :)  Hope everyone has a great holiday weekend and BE SAFE. :)
RandomActsOfPolish,3c2pi9,Bunnynose7,2,Sat Jul 4 05:51:22 2015 UTC,So glad the bad mood went away.  That's always a great feeling. Hope you wake up in a good mood today :)

RandomActsOfPolish,3c17sr,Healsforhugs,3,Sat Jul 4 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"Copy from another comment. Swatches won't really be useful since the polishes aren't your typical polishes.    The whole set is very thin/sheer colors that are used to match your skin/nail color and make it look like you have no polish on. For example the purple is a color corrector, so it's not actually like a polish. It is Lavender Perfector and it says it's ideal for neutralizing discoloration and adding a cool base. Zoya describes the set as ""The six Perfectors use optical diffusers, keratin fillers, micronized reflective color pigments and micro thin film formers to create an ultra sheer veil which ensures the natural vibrancy of the nail is enhanced rather than concealed."" Basically it whole set is to fix damage, or to give you a no color clean nail look."
RandomActsOfPolish,3c17sr,Healsforhugs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:44:36 2015 UTC,"I think that would make it even more important to have swatches, or I guess ""before and after"" pictures. I was curious about this set and I didn't bother purchasing it because I wanted to see what it looked like first. But if you're not interested in that, a follow up would be super cool of you :P"
RandomActsOfPolish,3c17sr,Healsforhugs,2,Sat Jul 4 03:02:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, before and after for sure. That will work better than swatches. I'm going to talk my husband into letting me do his nails with this since they have a ""mens line"" too."

I started with a white base, then put blobs of red white and blue on the nail in random spots, then put a piece of sandwich bag over the nail and pressed down on it a bit to spread the polish.  Here's a visual if that helps. :)  After that I sponged on the glitter (the base was very pink and I wanted as little of that as possible)."

(I think it was advertised as 'platinum' and it is so very not.) If you want a pure silver, I would recommend KB Shimmer's silver flakies. They're a shattered mirror silver, and the smallest grade of them should be roughly the same size as the fine size of amazeballs, which is what I used for this.   That all said, if you want an incredibly fine, incredibly blingy, single-coat silver-gold glitter, amazeballs is the shiznit.

RandomActsOfPolish,3bytzk,missus_b,4,Fri Jul 3 13:55:10 2015 UTC,"There has been no discussion about it amongst the mods thus far. I'm not sure how long this will last, or how widespread it will get. But I think it's mostly subs bigger than us ""going dark"" in solidarity.   On a personal level, I understand and support it. The admins seldom consider or include the subreddit moderators in decisions/changes with widespread impact. Mods are who make and maintain communities, not admins. That said, we've worked pretty hard to make and nurture this community, and I'm not sure that going dark now, and taking that community away from people we care about is the right choice.   Again, this is purely my personal opinion and I haven't discussed with any of the other mods. A holiday weekend can be a pretty inopportune time to get a discussion of this gravity going."
RandomActsOfPolish,3bxjpz,kimshadows7x,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"I JUST figured out stamping and now i'm obsessed! For me, the game changer was getting a different stamper. I had been using the rectangular ones (I had a hard one, and a squishy one) and I have super curved nail beds, so it just wasn't working for me. I upgraded to one of those big, super squishy ones and suddenly I could stamp!   Another thing that helps is just speed. Spread the polish, then put the bottle down and pick up your scraper (old gift card works best for me) and stamper. Scrape, immediately stamp, and then stamp onto your nails. Lightning quick. Also, don't apply a ton of pressure putting it on your nails or it'll smude like crazy. I've even pushed my base coat off before o.O"

RandomActsOfPolish,3buofo,skelezombie,2,Thu Jul 2 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"No, actually.... You'll think I'm full of shit but I don't have any real art background. I took some art lessons when I was 6-7 years old and I'm 24 now. I don't even remember for how long... Since then I was able to draw stuff pretty decently, but never entirely from scratch, always by imitating something else. I never moved on from that phase, so if I were to just draw anything without any references I'd be pretty lost. Very little painting at all - I only painted stuff for art class assignments at school. This is the first time I've ever attempted to draw or paint skulls. I took about an hour to do each."

RandomActsOfPolish,3btx5o,serenaisblank,3,Thu Jul 2 11:07:14 2015 UTC,What kind of tape did you use?
RandomActsOfPolish,3btx5o,Rainwound,2,Thu Jul 2 17:46:08 2015 UTC,Just regular scotch tape. It bled under the tape and it was hard to clean up
RandomActsOfPolish,3btx5o,Ididntknowiwas,3,Thu Jul 2 23:24:46 2015 UTC,"I think they look quite good. :) One thing that I noticed is that pictures tend to be a lot harsher than what actually looks like IRL since the pics are all zoomed in and you have the time to fixate on the details and pick them apart and get all bothered about it. IRL, no one notices.  But if you want it to be picture perfect -not that you need to- there's a couple ways to fix it and both are easy."
RandomActsOfPolish,3btx5o,Ididntknowiwas,3,Thu Jul 2 04:03:52 2015 UTC,First part: soo true!  Second as well if your not happy with the line screw perfect lines get a makeup sponge out and fade them together for a whole new look!

RandomActsOfPolish,3btx5o,BlueSprite714,3,Thu Jul 2 23:25:57 2015 UTC,So true.in person the little mistakes aren't even noticeable! When I look at the pictures I have I nit pick so much when in person no-one knows what I'm talking about lol
RandomActsOfPolish,3btx5o,Rainwound,2,Thu Jul 2 19:41:14 2015 UTC,I didn't even realize until I looked at the picture that the white has a smear of red in it and now I can't stop staring at it!

Usually I wouldn't, but I pre-made a bunch for the week and haven't been eating them for dinner, so I don't want them to go to waste.  I went to the dollar store and bought 10 of these containers and thats what I've been making my salads in. They've held up pretty well all week, too, no wilting. My salads consist of 3 cups of greens (I use the power greens from Costco), cucumber slices, 1/2 cup of mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries and blackberries) 1/4 cup of feta and then dressing. Today I used the Kraft Asian Toasted Sesame.  Normally for breakfast I'll have either granola or uncooked oatmeal mixed in with a container of Chiobani or Dannon Light and Fit Greek Yogurt with fruit on the bottom. Once my costco pack of that is gone though, I'm gonna move to 3 eggwhites + 1 egg, an orange and a serving of oatmeal like my trainer suggested.  Dinner I make with my husband as well, so we usually have a meat (chicken, fish, steak), brown rice and green beans or corn. I try to have it no later than 2 hours before I go to bed... and I also drink a gallon of water a day."

I also recently filed my lovely, long nails into little stubs recently (rage file, ugh), and I miss them so much.   Tell me about your cats! I LOVE cats. I'm a veterinarian.  Stamping is fucking awesome. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but now it's sooooo fun. I highly, highly, highly recommend the Creative Shop stamper and scraper (you can find it on Llarowe.com)--it is by far the easiest, squishiest stamper I've ever used. If I had started with that one, I think I would have learned faster!  What are you studying in college?"
RandomActsOfPolish,3bthsj,secretagentkitty,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"Rage file is a wonderful way to put it! i'm glad someone else is sharing the short nail boat with me, i miss mine too! i didn't realize how much i like painting the underside of my nails.. when there is an underside to paint. :(   oh goodness, i don't think anyone has ever really asked to hear about my cats! this is exciting, i'm not even sure where to start. my neighbor had kicked them outside when they were just kittens, as he does when he gets sick of them. i couldn't spend my life outside getting eaten by mosquitos anymore so we took them in. it was starting to get really cold out too. :( i've never regretted giving them a home for a second! Peaches is our calico: http://i.imgur.com/dj8DhaR.jpg  and this is my boy Nimrod http://i.imgur.com/29chLDr.jpg .  i know his name sounds like we're degrading him, and admittedly we were at first because we was a little derp, but we kept it once we looked into the actual meaning of the word. Evidently in most English speaking countries, it means a skillful hunter or warrior, but it's derogatory in the US because of Bug's Bunny calling Elmer Fudd a ""poor little Nimrod"".  i will have to check out that stamper and scraper- i saw that it was highly recommended in the stamping thread on the side bar. i saw your little chrome bees, SO cute! :3  i'm studying early childhood education. i have worked primarily in sandwich shops and call centers, but i had a mental breakdown that led to an epiphany last fall. i realized that children have always brought me the most joy and that i would probably be most happy choosing a career working with them. i was afraid that going back to school at 25 would be near impossible, but my first semester went really well. :) kudos to you for being a vet! i have so much respect for people who work in that field."
RandomActsOfPolish,3bthsj,secretagentkitty,2,Thu Jul 2 03:09:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, your kitties are ridiculously cute! Nimrod is very photogenic! I love how he's hugging that bear. And omg Peaches is gorgeous. I love how prominent the tabby markings are in her calico pattern. So glad you gave those sweethearts a home.   I love cats so, so much, but at the moment, I don't have any! Part of the reason is because I'm an intern at a specialty hospital, which is basically a very intense year of additional training for vets who want to then move onto residencies, or simply become clinicians with a wider skill set. I work 70+ hour weeks, all kinds of weird shifts (last weekend for example I did 3 14 hr shifts overnight on emergency before jumping back to a day schedule for internal medicine). My boyfriend is also a veterinarian and an intern, and we are often on opposite schedules. Fortunately, our dog, Marcus is very easygoing and actually loves coming to work with me and boarding, so he has been very chill with our wacky schedule. Man, I love Marcus. He is such a goofy, loving derp. We plan to get a kitty after this year internship is up, and we are home more regularly.  Thanks for the compliment about the chrome bees; they were fun to do! I've done a lot of fun stamping patterns. This koi one is one of my favorites. I've also done circuit boards, and another personal favorite, dinosaurs! Stamping is fun. :)  Good luck with school! It's really nice when you find a career that is a good fit for you. :) Glad to hear your first semester went well."

Nimrod has always been super social though, he actually gets sad when people leave. :(   it's cool that your boyfriend is also a vet and intern, Marcus is a lucky pup to have two owners who are knowledgeable about pets! I know how sucky it can be to work opposite shifts that your SO does, i can't imagine pulling 14 hour shifts though, yuck! i'm sure it will pay off in time though, plus it is nice to get a little time apart sometimes.   and Marcus! He is so cute, what breed is he? His eyes in the 3rd picture melted my heart, and his smile in the 5th one is just so funny! and the way he's sitting and the look on his face in the 1st picture is just great. it's awesome that he can come to work with you too! i'm sure he'd get along swimmingly with a kitty too. we are actually both dog people, but we're content with having two kitties for now. they're sort of dog-ish sometimes, lol.   wow, i love that koi mani! and your cuticles are beautiful. :3 i had to show my SO the circuit board ones, he thought that they were neat. i love the dino ones too! the purple holo underneath is gooorgeous. i didn't realize how much i loved holographic polish until i got one for Christimas, it was a small bottle of silver holo by Nails Inc. and it lasted like 2 manicures before it was gone. and all of the polish thinner in the world wouldn't revive it, lol. i ended up Frankenstiening a new sparkle topcoat using the remains of that, the rest of my CG Fairy Dust, and some holo glitter. it went.. okay.   i hope your day goes well! thanks for giving me the opportunity to gloat about my kitties. :)"

RandomActsOfPolish,3bs0wv,dellaluce,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:54:39 2015 UTC,"on ebay you can find a bunch of nail polishes go up for auction, sometimes huge lots, sometimes just individual polishes. there will be a bidding war and the final price will usually go for about half the retail cost. i love them more than words can say and they are in part of why i am currently restricting myself to a no-buy until i can get my life right."

(and i loveee the galaxy nails! whats your solar system tattoo look like? it sounds awesome!) Whats your fav thing to bake? i suck at cooking but i love love baking! (i think i like eating the goodies more though haha)
RandomActsOfPolish,3br5cx,silentwail,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:38:04 2015 UTC,I love tribal nails but I get frustrated when they don't look perfect. Here's a pic of my solar system tattoo. It's super fresh in the photo so I'll try to get a better picture of it tonight! Do you have any tattoos? You can kinda see the galaxy nails in the pic too but not like at all actually lol.   Lemon bars are probably my favorite thing to bake. Followed by boozy cupcakes - champagne cupcakes for real. I just made salted caramel brownies last night! I like baking better for the same reason. I'm a pretty good cook but I just don't care enough lol. What's your favorite thing to bake/eat?
RandomActsOfPolish,3br5cx,Aerys1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:46:35 2015 UTC,"yea i get so frustrated with trying to make my nails so perfect and its like im never happy enough im so picky haha. then i post them with semi self deprecating titles which must be annoying like im fishing for compliments when its really bc im too hard on myself lol i just realized i must do that and need to just stop saying my nails suck ha.  that tattoo is sooo freaking cute i love it so much. i love space/science/scifi stuff. i dont have any tattoos sadly. not for lack of wanting them though i just always said if i got one the first one would be perfect and meaningful n bla bla and then never got any lol piercings is as edgy as ive gotten.  For someone who isnt a huge fan of lemon/lime desserts i do love lemon bars. probably just bc the buttery crumbly bottom though . The salted caramel sounds delicious i def love caramel stuff.    I do love making/eating fun kinda cupcakes with filling and what not... mini ones usually bc i just think mini ones are cuter and i appreciate the frosting to cake ratio better lol.  Also love making bars. like ones with a nice gram cracker bottom and coconut,chocolate and/or caramel... stuff like that is my favorite to make bc its my fav to eat! haha"
RandomActsOfPolish,3br5cx,Bunnynose7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"Haha exactly! I have a fourth of july one I'll be posting soon and I could get the lines straight or even and I was finally like ""fuck it, flags wave in the wind""  Thank you! I think it is my favorite of my tattoos, though it is very hard to say (I have six, probably seven soon) I feel like the newest one is always my favorite. I really love space science and working for NASA as a PIO is kind of my dream.   I waited a really long time to come up with my perfect meaningful tattoo - and honestly it's now probably the one I like least. Mine range from super meaningful (I have one that represents me and my brother, one that I got after ending my engagement) to kinda kitschy (I have an ampersand on my wrist because that way when I hold hands with someone it's me & them - get it!) and some of them I got just because they're pretty, no deeper meaning. The biggest thing I learned is make sure it's pretty first and foremost. Like I feel like I sacrificed pretty for meaning on my first tattoo and I regret that I bit. I want them to look like works of art even after the meaning fades.   Oh I'm allllll about that lemon! Lemoncello torte from cheesecake factory. Mmmmmmmm.  That all sounds so good. I'm hungry again now.   Oh! Can I change my favorite dessert? Mine is probably Biskvit Torta. I'm not really great at making it yet - my mom is pretty good and my aunt is very good. It's my aunt's MIL's recipe that she brought over from Serbia. It's butter cookies soaked in coffee and layered with a creme made of bitter cocoa, egg yolks, butter and sugar. It's so terrible for you and tastes like heaven. I need to make that soon."

Comedy   Parks and recreation 30 rock  portlandia Shameless the UK version on netflix is sooooo funny and addicting. i think its way better than the us version.  United States of Tara mom with multiple personalities  Unbreakable Kimmy Schmit   I havent watched the originals really just an episdode or two. have you seen that yet since ur a VD fan? I loved them on VD though so i dont see why i wouldnt enjoy the spin off.    Supernaturalish stuff   Being human Loved both versions but the US one i liked better. i love most shows from the scifi channel that they have on netflix.   The Strain is a new show from FX that i just found on Hulu and its awesome so far..viral vampire outbreak lol i love zombie stuff so any apocalyptic/outbreak show im probably going to like.  From dusk till dawn the series is on netflix too and it was pretty good, didnt blow me away though but i loved the movie so had to watch it.  Sense8 is a new netflix series about these 8 people being telepathically linked Orphan black on amazon prime is really good..about clones...the main actress blows me away bc shes so good at playing so many different characters that are all her clones. Hemlock grove is an awesome netflix show with werewolves vampires and all that good stuff Bitten is a good show about a pack of werewolves...reminds me very much of WB kinda shows i dont know what channel it actually airs on though   Witches   Salem is an awesome show about..obviously...salem lol during the witch trial times  Witches of Eastend is another show that reminds me of WB shows. a family of witches that keeps getting reincarnated Fringe i love fringe its one of my favorite shows for sure. Alot of fringe science/crime stuff...very cool story and hey pacey from dawsons creek is on it! lol   Crime stuff   Wentworth is like an austrailian version of orange is the new black.  Sherlock Dexter Bones Blacklist   Superheroes   Arrow hes hot its WB so i like it lol Agents of Shield   This one is more scifi but i forgot to add it   Ascension just watched this one and love it, idk what channel airs it and its only 6 episodes but it was awesome. its set back in the 60s kind of...basically the govt or whoever sent a spaceship on a 100 year journey in the 60s but it turns out that they never left earth and all these people are being tricked into thinking they are in space but its a fake spaceship and theyre like experimenting on the people in it. idk it sounds crazy, and it is, but its actually really good lol   and the other ladies mentioned some good ones i didnt add.. i mean in all reality i could probably list a million more but i cant think of anymore and i did just write down a crap load of crap for you to dig through haha (everything i listed is all on netflix except for the couple i said were on hulu or amazon)"

RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,Rainwound,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome. I really love the look of two story farmhouses, but after struggling up and down stairs with a 100+ lb dog, we decided when we can build a house we'll make it just one level, so when we're old we won't have such a bad time. I'm totally adding a wooden rocking chair to my daydream"
RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,duckydoom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"Anyone have any get rich quick schemes?    I do but they either involve lots of luck, a bunch of starting money to invest, and/or are very illegal. :/  Your house reminds me of my cousins in Italy.  Big houses, most of my cousins owned orchards and were into crafts of some sort. They at least made a lot of homemade preserves and the older women knew how to knit and sew. It was pretty awesome."
RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,Rainwound,2,Wed Jul 1 23:03:20 2015 UTC,"Define ""illegal"" hahaha. I'm sure we could find loopholes ;) I'm not the luckiest person, so banking on that isn't the best idea.   Your cousins' houses sounds epic. And in Italy.... thats one of the many places I've longed to go. I think I've revised my daydream to put myself in Italy."
RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,duckydoom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you'd have to scam people out of their money. There are loopholes that allow you to do the scam, but if they catch you you're toast.  Oh, some of them had kind of run-down old houses, other had beautiful modern houses they redecorated from top-to-bottom, sometimes the houses had an old wing they used more and the new wing that was reserved for special occassions. The ones that lived in cities or towns usually had their orchards in summer houses in the countryside or close to the beach; sometimes they had a small one at home and a bigger one in other places. Some kept building storeys on top, for the adult newlywed children. I think the nicest thing about it was that it was a small, quiet, peaceful town where everyone knew each other and it was safe to leave the doors unlocked at night. Even the air was cleaner. They were all so welcoming and warm. They like to feed you a lot of the amazing food they make..."
RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,Rainwound,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"Are we talking like, Bernie Madoff type scams, or like... crazier than that? I've done ""home businesses"" before (and sucked at them because I'm not pushy enough).   Those houses just sound so amazing, and so do the neighborhoods. Being able to trust your neighbors to the point where you can leave your doors unlocked would be great. We know a few of our neighbors here and we're all definitely friendly, but that sounds as though its on a different and more amazing level entirely."
RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,duckydoom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like Ponzi schemes for example, that's what Madoff did. In order for you to get money you have to get other people to part with their money. Usually, in order to do that you have to offer something that people want more than they want to save their money. And in order to do that, you usually need money, skills and a dose of good luck. Obviously, deceiving people into giving you money with empty promises and giving little or nothing in return is the fastest and easiest way to get money.  Home businesses won't get you rich quickly. If you mean the catalogue crap, you can make some money but it won't be much.  Now, mini-home-enterprises... DIY products and whatnot. That's what I call a real home business. You can make serious money off them, like some indie manufacturers and Etsy craftsmen have by offering unique quality products or by hitting the fandoms or by being Internet Famous for example. But you need some starting money, the skills to create products and a dose of good luck when it comes to the market and whatnot."
RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,Rainwound,2,Thu Jul 9 02:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did Pampered Chef, a couple of scrapbooking ones, and It Works. I do have an Etsy store and do craft shows with my soap, and I make enough to keep my habit going, but not enough to profit substantialy lol."

RandomActsOfPolish,3bprob,Bunnynose7,2,Thu Jul 9 22:17:29 2015 UTC,"For sure. It also makes it a lot easier to convince the husband that I need to buy soap supplies, which usually leads to a craft store visit... hahah."

Italians are big on tradition. It would take you 20 minutes to reach the countryside. I once got lost at 4 am and found my way back to my cousins' place in pitch dark and while I would have been a guaranteed robbery victim where I live, nothing happened there. I don't think I even heard a bug."

I even went Pinterest mum mode and made him some dinosaur silhouette canvases for his room (I am strangely proud of them haha).

I was never into girl stuff either i was a tomboy all the way and all my cousins are guys mostly and i have two brothers so i def grew up watching TMNT and ghostbusters and all that. I feel like i have only grown into the 'girly' stuff more recently and i kind of love it now.

However, I still think I'd have made the canvases, but with pink dinosaurs had Ezra been a girl!   I have no doubt Ezra will want his nails painted when he's older, he always loves looking at mine (he's never seen my natural nails haha). My friends' little boy enjoys doing his and he's 3 😊   Kids should be kids, if Ezra wants to play with dolls or dinosaurs it makes no difference to me, as long as he's happy. I want to take him to science museums and play at being superheroes, and paint with him and I would do that if he were a girl!   Yay for fighting gender norms!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3bjg2x,akatz161,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:25:53 2015 UTC,aw 7 months they are so freaking cute then and just keep getting cuter when they get bigger... its like you dont think they could get any more perfect and they turn into a little person learning all this new stuff and its amazing haha. i dont have kids im just speaking about my nephew and other family i grew up taking care of but theyre still as cute lol.   My nephew (levon) is turning 2 in september so hes so much fun now running around and all that. he STILL isnt speaking (except his small vocab words like ma da bye bye pweasseeee and stuff) but he has no problem getting his point across! lol he always loved my nails when im with him and would point to them and get so excited then he found my polish stash and HAD to get his done! i do them when i can and he loves it soooo much and shows them off to everyone. i dont get to do it too much bc his mom n dad have him doing baby modeling or whatever it is so he has photoshoots all the time and i cant have him with blue nails for them lmao. ( lemme tell you though they had a good idea doing it bc its gotta be a good start to a college fund or whatever bc they have a bank account for him and its so much fun seeing him on tv or in ads!)  And we let him be whatever he wants to be too its so cute.. he puts his 'makeup' on like a freaking pro when im doing mine. he sits right at my vanity mirror and pretends to powder. hes smart enough to know now that i dont really put makeup on though so i gotta get more sneaky now... they get way too smart way too fast lmao. (and if he ever wants to be a drag queen omg hes got an amazing start i know hell be a pro lmao)  i wanna see the dinos you made they sound amazing and id be proud of them too i love making stuff like that! it makes the nursery that much more special bc u put your touch on it!

On the back of the paper I drew the silhouettes of the dinosaurs (thank you google images), cut them out and then glued it on to the canvas with pva glue. When that dried I covered the whole canvas in a layer of pva to protect it 😊 you could do anything, I'm think of doing a dance themed set (so like ballerina/breakdancer etc set) for my little sister for her Christmas present as she does pretty much every type of dance going lmao she's only 5 so I hope she'll like them 😊"

(and shes 5 omg im picturing her break dancing and im in love lol so cute! im flashing back to my dance recitals when i was a kid and my mom let me do my own makeup... horrifying... i froze on stage once and the next one all the girls did different dances we were a mess haha that was the END of my dancing career!)"

Instead, I'm like, ok, I have to work for this chunk of time, but then I get to sleep for a little bit, and then get to be awake to do things for a little bit. Strangely, even though I'm getting less sleep than ever, I think because I don't have my days broken into neat 24 hour chunks, and I'm not starting my day at the same time each day, that I don't feel tired."

Here is her post!  Also for the hell of it i found couple more that i actually think are really cute...   This dry brush one is cute but didn't blow me away but i thought it deserved an honorable mention lol. I always love a nautical theme too so i figure they count as 4th of july with the flag colors. My favorite of the ones i found searching is this one with BOWS!!! im sorry but throw a bow on anything and it will automatically be my favorite lol it's just something about them that make anything they're on ten times cuter haha. i might actually do this one for 4th of july!

RandomActsOfPolish,3bi68l,alphamuggz87,2,Mon Jun 29 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"i was 'stood up' twice. First time was the color exchange, and i was so bummed i got shafted because i signed up for international. My regifter had a kind heart, but the items i received had nothing to do with my fav color and the little trinket was broken and i just threw it out anyways. The second one was the snack exchange, i again signed up international and i didnt necessarily get stood up but some 19 year old douchebag from germany thought it was funny to send me black licorice flavored EVERYTHING when i clearly stated i HATED blac licorice. but my mom LOVES it so she received some goodies instead. so even though i got the shaft, it still worked out. Im more about sending out a gift and having someone love it! i always try to include something i made myself. You go to redditgifts.com and sign up there. they do them every few months and there are so many different themes, its alot of fun. i get the kids involved too so i feel like it teaches them a valuable lesson about giving what you can, if you can.

I'm netters and I'm a polish addict...whoops this isn't NPAA lol I've been really consistently and seriously painting my nails since late Fall 2013 For as long as I can remember I've had more nail polish than ""normal people"" would consider owning but since I bit my nails I really only painted my toes. Then I discovered nail blogs and started following a few on and off for a couple years. On one of the blogs I saw the Fingerpaints original flakies press release and knew I needed at least one. That was my first time in a Sally's and, since I was a naive pre-polish horder, I only got Twisted. Things really picked up after that and I started following more blogs, discovered my first indie brand, and then finally stopped biting my nails.  I feel my strengths are stamping, watermarbling, gradients, and clean application some weaknesses are freehand painting, french tips, and coming up with nail art ideas without inspiration or prompts"

I like the general idea of long and in-depth contests. lol   I am chef_boyceardee  I have been painting my own nails since December of 2013.  Before I started painting my own nails I went to the salon religiously for about four years before that. Nails have always been my one really girly thing I do, so I enjoy bright and designed nails. However going to the salon became really expensive, especially after I left my job. It also was becoming somewhat of a chore making sure I made time for the salon. This happened to be the time my bf showed me reddit and I found out about various nail subs. This opened me up to DIY manis and that this was possible. I ended up making a checklist of supplies and made my last trip to the nail salon to get my acrylics off. I never turned back :) My strengths are dotticures, stamping, and gradient.  Weaknesses are freehand, striping tape, and copying manicures exactly."

RandomActsOfPolish,3bh13q,tibean2992,2,Mon Jun 29 04:10:37 2015 UTC,"CAN I STILL ENTER THIS OR NO  EDIT: NEVERMIND I READ THE CLOSE DATE WRONG  Hello! I'm super excited to be participating in this! BEGIN NOVELLA~   My name is pirateshiplol, the great, laughing pirate with a ship :3 It's officially been a year since I started doing my nails and caring (aka not biting, ripping them off, pulling at my hangnails, etc) for them. It amazed me how much pain I put myself through on a weekly basis when I wasn't caring for them! WTF was wrong with me? One day, I saw someone on my FB feed share this blogger (later known as thepolishaholic) after I'd been given a pretty polish by my roommate. I decided to look into this blogger, with my then-terribly done nails (I didn't even use a basecoat. How crazy!) and saw how beautiful her nails were, how amazing her posts and reviews were, and, the holy grail~She had over 800 polishes! Her blog tag, ""Rehab can't help this addiction,"" made so much sense. I vowed to one day have as many beautiful polishes. Thus, my nail craze was born. My roommate had been telling me to reddit more, and at this point I'd only been subbed to the reddits that they give you upon making an account, some space stuff, and gaming stuff. Then, my beautiful, perfect /u/thehungryelbow, told me about /r/PolishGauntlet, which led me to this great, supportive sub of beautiful, wonderful addicts like me <3 My strengths definitely would be sugar spun nail art. Despite being super messy with a bit of a painful cleanup, I LOVE doing it and am obsessed with the results for days. I also do quite a bit of gradients, so I guess that also is one of them. I also have gotten really good at painting without flooding the side walls or cuticles, making it much easier to clean up :3 I am proud of myself. My weaknesses would be...getting inspiration for manicures (when I do get inspiration, sometimes it is hard to translate onto my nails...), getting discouraged when a nail breaks (leading me to not doing my nails for weeks :/), and freehand art. I'm working on that now, though, as I want to have super wonderful doodles. But, I know a lot of people use acrylic paint and I'm not sure where to start! So overwhelming!

They have suffered from the chop themselves after I snapped a massive chunk out of one of them when cleaning the flat.... I became interested in nail art when I was sent a link to something that had appeared on the front page by my boyfriend. He thought it was cool and thought I would like it. He was correct so I started googling around and playing with my meager collection at the time (of about 5-6 polishes). My strengths I would say exist with dots and gradients and colour combinations. My biggest weakness would be my patience. And watermarbling, cos fuck watermarbling.....   Bring on the challenges! I need some inspiration :D"

I've been painting my nails regularly for a few years now. I started because I was a serious nail biter my whole life, and keeping them painted finally got me up stop that bad habit! My strength is probably stamping because I do it most often, and my weakness is probably water marbling. I definitely need to practice more, but I'm kind of a perfectionist on my nails and get frustrated when the marbles aren't exactly as I envisioned lol. Anyway, thanks for the contest and I'm looking forward to the outcome!!"

Great idea u/batdalek!  Edit:  I'm back!  My name is Jessica and I live in Florida with My husband, our daughter, two cats, four birds, and a hamster.  I started painting my nails about two years back when I realized it kept me from chewing the hell out of my cuticles.    I'm pretty decent when it comes to gradients, but I tend to shake a bit for the dotting to turn out as well as I'd like.  Stamping has been fun to play with and I think I'm okay.  I've also made decals on plastic bags that I then transferred to my nails and those worked out pretty well.  I've never attempted water marbling, but I would certainly like to.  I have a feeling I'll make a mess when I do!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3bh13q,lochnessie15,2,Mon Jun 29 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"I love this idea!   Hello! Like many of us here, I'm a polish addict, especially when it comes to indies. I had a tool box full of polish back in middle school, but got out of the habit of painting my nails when life got crazy in high school and college. I picked up my first polishes again in August 2013, when I was trying to stop biting my nails in time for my wedding in Sept. 2013. That ignited my addiction again - I got a trial Julep box, found nail forums, discovered indies, and it all went downhill from there, including when I found all these awesome nail polish communities on reddit!   My strengths are gradients (although I hate the clean up!), stamping (ish), and having a shit ton of colors and finishes in my collection. Weaknesses are water marbling and freehanding, and coming up with unique combinations - I can do an accent nail or all one color, but struggle with skittles.  <3"

I live in the midwest and am a full time college student. I have a fat kitty and a lovely boyfriend. I like crafts, nails, and the internet.   -I've been painting my nails for seriously, exactly three years, almost to the day. I started college three years ago, on july first, and the night before I left to move into my dorm I bought three bottles of Maybelline Color Show to take with me. (started at the bottom, now we here.) I was a nailbiter for literally my whole life. I watched my grandma bite at her nails and cuticles and I wanted to be just like her, so I would bite them until they bled. I figured making them pretty would stop me, and it did!  -What got me into polish was reddit. I was just hitting the random button, and found RAoP. I wasn't really active for a few months though.   -Strengths: water marble, gem/decoration placement, filing/shaping, gradients, and the fact that I love trying new things and learning :3   -Weaknesses: a big one is stamping. i'm learning though! still new to it. freehand drawing, inspiration/motivation (I hit a rut last fall that I'm still not fully back from) and using brushes. completely clueless on that one.   :)"

My name is Ihatejellybeans1! I used to go by jlwalk905 back when I first started this sub.   ° I have been serious about painting my nails since Oct 2014 but I have played around with polish since 2006 (I even still have a bottle or two from back then).   ° I started getting into this because I have problems sometimes biting my nails and when they have polish on them it helps me  not to bite.   ° Strengths: I love colors and must have them in my life. I also paint sometimes (which may help in a contest like this). Also I'm competitive which will help me do my best. Nail wise my strengths are stamping, gradients and glitter!  ° Weaknesses: The fact that I have short nails. I've been good on not biting for a long time, but I relasped last week. Still trying to take care of my nails again so they will grow out. Also I have been a lot with a long commute, so I'm gone 14-15 hours a day. So time may be a weakness as well. Nail wise my weaknesses are french tips, water marble (I know how, just haven't tried it yet) and dotticures (I can't seem to have cute dotticures to save my life)."

I've been painting my nails more seriously and consistently for about two years now, though prior to that I got them done at the salon pretty regularly. I had a co-worker who was a major nail polish addict, and she really inspired me to get into it. Then I discovered this sub and my love went crazy! Strengths... I'm not sure. I'm pretty boss at using striping tape. ;) Also I've gotten pretty darn good at gradients! For weaknesses I'd definitely say water marbling and stamping. They are the bane of my existence! But I'm still trying and getting better. :)"

Okay so im maggie my username is based on rainbow brite because it was my favorite cartoon as a kid. I have been painting my nails since i stopped biting them and became more serious about taking care of them. I finally curbed the biting during college so about 9 years ago. When i finally stopped the biting i found that keeping my nails painted helped not to relapse and its been a love story ever since haha. I didn't know much about nails when i first started other than colors at drug stores but over the years i learned more and more. When i joined this sub i discovered so many awesome indies and stamping... its been a whole new world since. I managed to fall more in love with something i already adored.   I would say my strengths are stamping and clean up even though i could def still improve lol. They just happen to be two things i practice alot and care about.   My weaknesses are def nail art specifically freehand. I have always loved all types of arts and crafts and being creative but have never been good at drawing/painting no matter how much i tried! So my nail art def suffers because of that. Also another weakness would def be being more careful with my nails and not being so hard on them. I suffer alot of breaks and tears from being really rough with them and alot of cleaning with no gloves (I'm working on it!).
RandomActsOfPolish,3bh13q,cupcake1713,2,Mon Jun 29 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"Yay, so excited to see this play out!!  I'm az2oh and have been polishing my nails for ages though I just started with nail art and obsessively collecting polishes about a year and a half ago. My husband introduced me to the laqueristas sub awhile back and it really inspired me to try taking polishing more seriously than ever before. I'd like to think my biggest strength is clean application. I've worked on it a lot and can now do a mani with little to no cleanup needed which makes me feel pretty proud. Weaknesses would probably be lack of creativity without inspiration from others online. Also, laziness lol I really enjoy doing my nails but when they last for two weeks with no chipping I just can't bring myself to do anything new! Which is making it impossible to try to go through all my untrieds lol I'm hoping this contest inspires me to stop that and do new manis more often :-)"

I started painting them when I was struggling with depression as a way to feel proud of something I'd accomplished and to relieve stress.

I'm also getting pretty okay at gradients!  My weaknesses are free-hand art, water marbling, and stamping (I've only tried water marbling once but the polish refused to cooperate and I haven't tried since, and I'm pretty sure I don't have the right polish for stamping since I've never been able to get the polish actually on the stamper)."

I've had a small polish stash for as long as I can remember because my toes are rarely naked.  I started doing my nails back in the early 2000s when I was wearing falsies to try to stop biting my nails.  It worked, but once I stopped wearing those I stopped painting my nails because my natural nails looked awful, polished or not.  Last year I randomly picked it back up, then I found this sub and it all kind of exploded. Strengths: Gradients, glitter gradients, dotticures, clean up.  I'm also kind of a perfectionist. Weaknesses: Stamping and water marbling (partly because I'm lazy and partly because I work with very little space), and freehand art.  Also, the perfectionist thing.  I can be really hard on myself."

I started back when I was in high school and fell in loooovve with the Revlon Street Wear collection because I'd never seen anything like it (shows my age, doesn't it?). I'd make my own stencils out of tape and use toothpicks to make stripes because striping brushes didn't exist in my world.

My mom would tease me for having a toolbox overflowing with nail polish bottles. Hahaha... if she only saw me now!!  My strengths are being awesome. No? Okay, fine.

RandomActsOfPolish,3b9quy,BlueSprite714,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:10:04 2015 UTC,Omg I loved that album thanks haha.I actually have my swatches similar to yours.I threw mine on key rings bc the bigger rings you show attached to the smaller rings don't fit in the holes on the swatches. I have those already from something I bought a while ago to organize but I'd really love to get smaller rings like yours that open easier than key rings lol. Do you remember where you got them or what they were called so it's easier for me to search for them? Thanks for any help!
RandomActsOfPolish,3b9quy,raine2207,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:48:25 2015 UTC,I got them from Office Depot/Office Max. 2 inch binder rings and the bigger ones are 3 inch binder rings.

RandomActsOfPolish,3b9quy,BlueSprite714,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:46:14 2015 UTC,I have mine on key rings separated by colors.then I have a ring of glitter toppers separate and my stamping polish on another ring.I painted half of the swatch black and the other white then stamped over it with my stamping polish to show how it covers dark and light colors. If I had more than a few holos I'd probably put them on their own ring but I don't have many so I put those with their respective color just like I put non topper glitters with their colors too. The key rings are cheap ones from old keychains so they're easy enough to open and get the swatches on and off...also don't have to take a lot off to get a new color in I just add it in the middle where it needs to go. But I'd still say the key rings are a little annoying to work with and I just saw raine2207s post with pictures and LOVE the rings she uses to hold her swatches!

I wouldn't expect great customer service or guest operations though. and they will dig through your bags hardcore at entrance. the stupid fucking kid at the metal detectors made my bf take off his (tungsten, which does not set off detectors) ring (we never take off our rings, he was trying to deny us entrance if he didn't) and then it fell and it got lost. didn't realize it for a bit. but luckily a police officer found it and I was walking around sobbing and we were looking at the entrance. she came up to me and said it was in the lost and found after we described it!   the park was kind of the low point in our trip for everyone. but I hope you have fun!

I was even at the grocery store last night and no one bothered to mention it. Very irritating way to start my morning. I just can't stand people being so inconsiderate of others, especially when we have to live together. So I left a note with a gentle reminder and a sad face so hopefully they feel bad.

RandomActsOfPolish,3b2y58,LinzDarling,2,Fri Jun 26 01:16:06 2015 UTC,I think next time I'll wait until the polish is totally dry and then line up the striping tape. The polish was still a bit tacky when I tried this time which caused the tape to stick and make obnoxious dents (thank goodness for top coats!). I'd also cut the striping tape a bit shorter next time so I could make sure to cover the ends of the tape with top coat to prevent curling.

I like really deep colours like wine-y reds and navy's but also bright neons in the summer :P  2)Ooh I love all finishes..matte, glossy, crelly, jelly. Probably just basic glossy finish is my favourite though  3) I don't like textured polish all that much... I really like a flat, smooth surface to my nailpolish so if I  put some on and it is raised it kinda bugs me :S  3) I love to read magazines...so I think just seeing pictures of people wearing nailpolish and ads for them really made me want to wear it!   4) My collection is definitely under 50. I'd say about 37.   5) I love all snacks! If I could eat only snacks for the rest of my life I would be so happy. I love anything chocolate-y, salt and vinegar chips, seaweed snacks, candy (especially sour stuff), cheezy things! Pretty much anything that is a snack. Except meat (cause I'm vegetarian) :)  Cheers!"

I mostly pick polishes because I like the way they look. The only indie brand I have a lot of (6) is Super Black.  What are your favorite polish colors? I really dig indigo, fuchsia, yellow, red, black, and neons  What polish finishes do you like (holo, shimmer, crellies, glitter toppers, etc)? I like holo but I've never tried. The two main polishes I love wearing are glitter and creams.  What are your polish dislikes? (Textures, glitters, specific colors, etc.) I don't like wearing pastels anymore unless they are nudes  What got you into polish? I started doing them VERY young, but it wasn't until I was out of high school that I did them all the time.   Is your collection under 50 polishes? Under 100 polishes? Share the size of your collection if you'd like (but no worries if you don't want to admit your number ;) I just counted and I have 64  What are your favorite snacky things? sour gummies all the way."

If you don't want to share publicly, do you have one that you would be ok with sharing with me if you win? My spreadsheet is a little out of date, but I can certainly share it if I win.  4) Answer me these questions:   What are your favorite polish colors? I really like wearing blues, purples, and greens. Pink is my favorite color in general. What polish finishes do you like (holo, shimmer, crellies, glitter toppers, etc)? I love almost everything! I wear holo polishes most often, because they're still super unique but easy to put on and remove. I also have a ton of glitter crellies. I use glitter toppers least often, as I prefer my glitter mixed in. The only things I don't like are crackle and bar glitters. What are your polish dislikes? (Textures, glitters, specific colors, etc.) I really dislike crackle polishes and bar glitters, as I mentioned above. I also tend not to like yellows/oranges, as they don't really look great on me.  What got you into polish? I needed a way to stop biting my nails! Is your collection under 50 polishes? Under 100 polishes? Share the size of your collection if you'd like (but no worries if you don't want to admit your number ;) Oh goodness, no. I've lost count, at this point. Definitely around 300 at least.

Also love holos, but don't really own many.   • What are your polish dislikes? (Textures, glitters, specific colors, etc.)  I absolutely can't stand the color yellow, so I own maybe two yellow polishes! I'm also not big on frosty finishes that show a lot of brush strokes.   • What got you into polish?  My sister! Two years ago I stayed the night at her place and we painted our nails. I've kind of been totally in to it ever since!   • Is your collection under 50 polishes? Under 100 polishes? Share the size of your collection if you'd like.  Well, my spreadsheet says I am at 306, but I think I've acquired probably 5-10 since I last updated? They're almost all drug store brands, with less than 10 indies in there.   • What are your favorite snacky things? I can eat the heck out of some oatmeal cream pies.

RandomActsOfPolish,3b45xu,misslion,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"Intro <3  Pinterest inventory There's a few missing I believe but not many at all.    Favorite polish colors are pink, teal, and I want to get some more grays and blacks. I love holo, and shimmers, oh and cremes so much. Really anything except glitter that is like weird shaped. lol I hardly have any dislikes except the weird glitter and I don't really do browns very often.  I always have enjoyed having things on my nails. I painted a lot when I was young but sucked and had no supplies. So at around 17 I got addicted to the nail shop. Went every two weeks almost religiously until about a year and a half ago I came across lacqueristas. That subreddit showed me that you can do cool nail art without acrylics and school. I was already tired of the nail shop, it seemed like a chore at that point so I gave it up. Did lots of research and chatting with reddit people and started my own. :) I don't have an exact number but I think I'm around 100-125. I might edit and give an exact number if I feel ambitious. I love all the snacks, but you already know that. i love chips, especially hot ones. Reese and butterfinger for chocolate. And I will eat damn near any fruity candy. Love fruity tootsie rolls, and airheads, and sour skittles!!   You are so sweet for holding this!! Thank you :)"

I need to branch out more! I don't normally wear yellow, but I might pick up a neon to see how I feel about it.   What got me into polish? I don't actually remember, I've been wearing polish since elementary school. I must have played with Mom's small collection before getting my own, getting hand me downs etc. I was always that creative kid so it was another kind of crafty fun to me.  Polishes I love: holos, metallics and glitters. I have barely any creams or jellies but I'd like some since they do look nice, I just always end up getting metallics..  Polishes I don't love: I haven't tried them, but I'm sure the textured ones would drive me mad. I hate when something catches on a chip in my polish, I can't imagine having that feeling on purpose :P.   Favourite snacky things: Fuzzy peaches are the bomb diggity.

I might be able to make one if I have time over the next couple days, but I'll be traveling. I don't have many indies though. I'll update my post if I'm able to make something.  edit: here's a start to a list, it's just indies so far though.   My favorite polish colors... I love wearing green, blue, teal, black and coral I love holos, shimmers, duo chromes, glitters I am not a huge fan of textured polishes (like the sand stuff, though I do have some because they were cheap!) and I'm not a big fan of pinks, though I have a couple very light ones for when I need a more neutral color for job interviews. I don't really like bright red, yellows and oranges. I'm also not much of a fan of creme polishes. I prefer at least somewhat of a shimmer. I used to bite my nails, up until around the age of 12 or 13. So I haven't bitten them for at least 21 years! It's really the only makeupy thing I do. I don't really use makeup, I just like color on my nails. I have pretty much always liked polish, but ever since I started here in Feb, my collection has been growing lots! I'd say my collection is around 150. A lot of those are drug store brands (lots of sinful colors!) because I just recently started getting into indies, so I don't have too many of those.

Here is my intro https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/2wntx9/i_love_nail_polish_lurker_alert/  I dont have a list of all my polishes or a board or anything like that.  1.) My fav polish colors are definitely purples and glitters, if there is purple AND glitter, SCORE. Oh and anything neon, the brighter the better!!!  2.) I really like a smooth shiny finish.   3.) I really dislike textured polishes. I also hate it when they come out streaky. I have a small set of 3 china glaze nail polishes and everyone is thick and goopy, and hard to spread. The polish ends up looking streaky and patchy.  4.) I have been wearing nail polish for as long as i can remember. I was born with a full set of polished nails. They were 'China Glazes Flying dragon'. True story.   5.)My collection is probably close to 60-70. I havent counted in a while and your contest has me thinking i should probably take some inventory. I only have two indie nail polishes as i had no idea indie polish even existed until a few months ago. i bit the bullet and bought some a few weeks ago and i love them!

Any shade really, though the brighter the better! I'm not sure I could pick a fave topper type. Maybe glitter?! I love glitter. But holos are so pretty. The only ""dislike"" I have would probably be giant charms on nails. They're obnoxious and catch on everything! I was a cashier at a grocery store, and saw someone buy this gorgeous orange glitter polish... I had to buy it myself. It's just gone nuts from there!

I don't have a list of polishes but i DO have swatches so what i can do is go take pictures of them and link them for you if you would like. Just let me know! Hope that's okay!  On to the questions:  Fav polish colors? I'd say i LOVE teals, too yacht to handle is one of my favorites. (although i do love a good nude as of the moment and i love anything grey)  Polish finishes? Hmm I have to be boring and say my favorite are cremes because i can add to them myself (nail art, stamping) and make something fun.  But if that didn't count i would pick jellys or crellies. I don't have many different polishes i have mostly cremes (drug store brands only a couple indies) so its hard to pick a favorite of many i didn't get to try. I do love jellys though because i think its really pretty getting to see through them.  Polish dislikes? I am not a fan of the color red at all in my life not just on my nails. the exception though is a deep deep red for winter that i have recently become a fan of. And as sad as this makes me saying, i just can't stand removing glitter haha. I am not a big fan of thickly packed glitter polishes but i do really enjoy glitter toppers or crellies/jellies with glitter in them. I like when they are more dispersed on the nail opposed to covering the whole nail if that makes sense. Also totally hate polishes that are streaky or that you can see the brush strokes on.  EDIT whoops forgot to answer a question! WHAT GOT YOU INTO POLISH? okay so i started really getting into it when i stopped biting my nails around 9 years ago. I found that keeping them painted helped curb the biting and i just fell in love with it then.  I have always been a creative person and love an outlet to be creative with and i found that nail polish gave me that. I love arts and crafts and painting my nails was just another way to create something.  Its also a great chance for me to give back to myself or 'treat yo self' lol. It's nice to find time to do something for me and have fun creating something.  My polish collection is around 100 polishes give or take. I have gotten a few minis recently but didn't swatch them (don't swatch the minis bc i feel like it is a waste since they really won't last that long). The swatched polishes i have though are right around 100.  Snacky things? Hmmm gosh i LOVE snacks haha i don't know what to pick lol. I like to try and stay healthy (doesn't always work! lol) so i love natures valley bars but i'm a girl that loves her peanut butter/chocolate snacks too lol. Oh and little chocolate covered fruits/pretzels are delicious... like those chocolate covered cranberries or acai berries or duhh raisinets lol."

RandomActsOfPolish,3b45xu,TotesMessenger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:22:17 2015 UTC,"1) Favorite polish colors are blue and metallics. I love how any royal or darker blue looks against my skin (purple too, but I don't own many of those because one of my school's rival's colors is purple... I'm so loyal to my school haha). Golds and silvers are my favorite ""neutrals"" for manis. My all-time favorite polish is ironically a purple - it's OPI's It's My Year. Essie's Aruba Blue is a close second though. It's the only polish I've had to get a second bottle on, except top/bottom coats. It went very well with my school's colors. Favorite metallic is OPI's Happy Anniversary. Most of my polishes are OPI, some are Etsy. I have no indie brands :[ but I have a bunch saved on my reddit list from lovely ladies in here!  2) I adore holos but only have a few, again. When I get a job, first on my list is a new laptop... then a bunch of holos. Again, I also like metallics a lot. I'm actually pretty simple when it comes to polishes. I don't have too many polishes that aren't just a solid color. And I probably have around... 40? nail polishes.  3) I HATE those fuzzy polishes. I've never used them myself but I've seen them and they just look awful to me. I also love how glitters look but hate the pain of taking them off.  4) In high school I was a cheerleader and had to keep my nails cut short (to not cut my flyer, as I was a base) and plain (so they didn't stick out). Couldn't even do school colors. Then I went to college and started doing my nails more and then moved onto tape manicures, which is primarily how I do my nails. It became something where I spent a couple hours if I was stressed just doing something for me and only being able to focus on that, since I couldn't exactly do homework or anything while my nails were wet. Graduated 6 months ago and it's been very stressful since I've been home, and I still use it as a stress relief.  5) As said above, I think I have around 40... my polishes are all over the house right now though just from shoving them wherever during cleaning.  6) I'm addicted to Stacy's Anything but Sea Salt pita chips. Oh man. I can eat a whole party sized bag by myself. I've been trying to diet and eat healthier though so lately my go-to snacks have been Greek yogurt (I really like the Dannon Oikos Traditional style), applesauce, bananas, and carrots. My favorite snack is a honeycrisp apple (my grocery store isn't currently selling them and I'm a bit heartbroken), cut into slices, peanut butter on it, and chocolate chips. So, so good."

I don't like that! All of my flakie polishes seem to do that and it's irritating. :( I'm also not a huge fan of matte polishes.   4) Growing up, I would watch my mom paint her nails. I've always had at least a few bottles of polish, but when I found reddit and subsequently /r/RedditLaqueristas, my collection quickly grew.   5) I'm sitting right around 100 right now.  6) Jelly Bellies, anything with coconut, almonds, or a combo of the two, chocolate, anything coffee flavored, and toffee. But I'm prettyyy open minded when it comes to snacks."
RandomActsOfPolish,3b45xu,oph1uchus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"Here's my intro My wishlist is in my flair though it's admittedly not very up to date lol I might have to get on that!  I have a Pinterest board of all of my polishes owned. My Pinterest name is the same as Reddit.    4.1 Favorite colors I think are probably pretty basic...pinks, reds, browns. I like neutrals but also like to do something daring every once in awhile lol  4.2 Favorite finish is hands down scattered holo (think Zoya Dream, Storm, etc.). I have some linear holos and they're gorgeous but I always go back to the scattered. Also, you can never go wrong with a great creme formula.  4.3 I don't dislike much. I wasn't ever really into sheer polish but with jelly sandwiches and leadlighting I can see their value now.   4.4 I think I got more into polish from the laqueristas sub. Seeing all the possibilities was mind-blowing! I had always had longer nails and would paint them occasionally but I had limited colors and little skill plus I'd wear that crap til the last chip came off on its own, never using remover! So embarrassing :-(   4.5 My collection is over 400 I believe though I'm not 100% on that figure lol  Thanks for hosting, it was fun to think about this stuff. Last time I did something like this I was pretty wishy-washy with my answers lol now that I have been doing this longer and I see what bottles I reach for over and over I can definitely tell what I like more than others."

I don't have a list of polishes that I own.. but I might make one sometime soon.. Hmm..  As for questions..  What are your favorite polish colors?  PURPLE.  Green, Teal, and some pale blues.  What polish finishes do you like (holo, shimmer, crellies, glitter toppers, etc)? Holo and duochrome are amazing.  What are your polish dislikes? (Textures, glitters, specific colors, etc.)  Chunky glitters bother me, I like a smooth finish.  What got you into polish?  This subreddit mostly!  <3  Is your collection under 50 polishes? Under 100 polishes?  I think I'm sitting somewhere around 70 polishes. <3  What are your favorite snacky things? Slim jims and Gummy worms."
RandomActsOfPolish,3b45xu,ChaoQueen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"Intro Wishlists are in my flair. I have Pinterest lists and a Google doc because I'm crazy.  I can share if I win. Favorite polish colors: Blues, teals, mints, corals, everything.   Likes: Cremes, holos, shimmers, crellies, jellies, glitter toppers.. So basically everything. Dislikes: I don't like plain textured polish.  Things like Zoya pixie dusts with glitter are okay though.  I also don't like bar glitter, but can deal if it's not just bar glitter.  Yellow is not a favorite color because it usually looks bad on me, but I keep a few around for artsy stuff. What got me into polish:  I've had a small collection for as long as I can remember because I nearly always have my toes painted.  Then in the early 2000s I used fake nails to try to stop my biting habit, so I painted those.  My nails did eventually grow, and I did stop biting them, but they looked awful for a long time (polished or not) and polish seemed to enhance all of the flaws so I stopped painting them.  Then early last year I randomly decided to paint my nails one day when I was doing my toes.  It didn't look nearly as bad as it used to, so I did it a few more times.  Then I found polish subs on reddit and it just blew up from there. Collection size:  A lot.  Definitely over 400.   Favorite snacky things: Chocolate chip cookies, peanut m&ms, beef jerky   Thanks for hosting! <3"

RandomActsOfPolish,3b12b6,LinzDarling,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"Probably my right ring finger or left middle finger since they're the only two (aside from my thumbs) with ideal, straight nail beds. I have a few crooked nail beds so they are hard to shape right and my arch nemesis is my right middle finger. Its nail bed is wider and shorter than every other finger so for it to look even the free edge has to be longer which throws me off from the back."

RandomActsOfPolish,3azjbh,RamonaRainicorn,2,Wed Jun 24 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"Of the mainstream brands, I think Zoya has the best minis - they're bigger than China Glaze or OPI minis, and are easier to use since they have a bigger opening. I have an awful time with the OPI and China Glaze minis since the brush opening is so tiny!  That being said, though, the OPI sheer tints are fun to play with. I haven't tried the OPI Color Paints yet, but I've seen good things - and they come in minis, too!  Being an indie nut, I love Indigo Banana's minis. They're bigger than your average minis and are easy to use - and she has such amazing polishes!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3azjbh,lochnessie15,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"I'll have to check out Zoya for sure. Only thing I don't like about the OPI minis is the smaller brush just because I like the ""Fat brush"" that they ussually have ha, I don't know how else to describe it. I have the Color Paints on my wish list because I saw a review on them and really liked them, I'll have to look for the Sheer Tints :) Thank you for all of that :)"

RandomActsOfPolish,3azjbh,BlueSprite714,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:36:11 2015 UTC,I was going to suggest the tints too lol. Not on Amazon but I got minis on etsy from some companies to try some polishes before I committed. I like getting smaller bottles to see if I like the formulas and colors-also colors I know I won't use as much but still love(like ones with glitter or something...i love a lot of them but have a love hate relationship with glitter polish!).

Unlike some nail artists out there I have no art background and can't do... say, crazy realistic portraits on my nails, haha. This kinda thing just takes lots of patience and a bunch of practice. The more time you take to do it, the better it will turn out.   I looked for some examples of butterfly tattoos on Google and picked the ones that were do-able. I did one or two on paper first, to get a feel of the brushes and the level of detail I was going to be able to achieve with them. Make sure both your hands are firmly supported against a surface to avoid a shaky pulse (I admit I kept forgetting that while doing my right hand haha). Start small and simple then slowly go bigger. When you see what you can achieve you'll feel compelled to challenge yourself more and more! :)"
RandomActsOfPolish,3ax3js,hbeen,2,Thu Jun 25 01:47:38 2015 UTC,Aww thanks I might try to do the nail art more! It's encouraging knowing you're not some crazy talented artist to begin with tbh haha. I've done way more simple stuff and that gets challenging lol i never thought to try to do some practice runs on paper or something before hand though. I have to admit I'm way better than I was when I started so practice probably would make a huge difference! I just get so frustrated (the slightly ocd perfectionist in me) and do stamping instead.Such an easier way out! Lol love yours though so I might have to not give up just yet though!

RandomActsOfPolish,3ax6lr,dnd1980,2,Thu Jun 25 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Hi! I've never been on this sub but I have a question about nail salon etiquette, I hope it's okay to post this here?   So I went to a nail salon a few weeks ago to get a fill on my acrylic nails. The guy who did my nails did an amazing job and I loved them! So when I needed a fill again, I went back. But they had some girl do my nails who was just bad. She was telling me how she's fresh out of high school (apparently her school had a program to become a certified nail tech). While filing my nails she kept hurting the skin around my fingers, and she did a sloppy shitty job. The polish is sloppy around the sides, and on some nails she did it so thick that literally hours later it didn't dry right and it got wrinkles and dents in it (this was after sitting under the nail light fan thing for a solid 20ish to 30 minutes). The acrylic is all uneven thickness depending on the finger (and I asked specifically to keep it thin, like the other guy did when I went there the first time). She also shaped them all slightly differently, which is irritating. Basically she did a shitty shitty job. But I hate making a scene so I didn't say anything, plus the wrinkles and dents didn't happen until later and I didn't notice how bad they really were until I left and could inspect better.   I really would like to go back to that salon if I can have literally anybody but her do my nails. It's close to my work and really convenient, and from what I've seen everybody else do and with my first experience, everybody else seems great. If I go back, how exactly should I say ""hey can I get my nails done by literally anybody except her""?"

I've also used the designs where since it was 2 different ones connected it was like a half moon mani almost. When my nail where much shorter I could manage one design per nail if I used the patterns across her body vs. up. And finally I used her torso for a little mermaid mani with the shell bra.

I have a similar polish by Lyn b designs like this but the green is not nearly as striking as it is in your mani! It reminds me of a pond of Lily pads lol.I have a pond in my backyard with some fish and Lily pads and the growth underneath gives off a green cast.

I can't get close to comfort her because she'll nip at me.   I feel bad and want to stay up with her but I'm also sick of her stinky breath and panting noises.   in other news I marbled my nails and mattified them so I feel fab."

RandomActsOfPolish,3asidh,blacqbird,2,Tue Jun 23 07:26:21 2015 UTC,"That's so rough with your dad. ALS is such a nasty disease. Would something like a framed picture be better than a card? Or maybe you could make some sort of treat that's softer (like brownies or cake or just pure chocolate?) or something else that he could more easily eat? Or would he appreciate a donation on his behalf to some sort of ALS charity? As you said, though, even empty-handed, I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

RandomActsOfPolish,3asidh,misslion,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:47:49 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. I think a few things won't be shipped no matter who buys them. No Amazon Global anymore. The biggest problem I have are the following two laws that were created specifically to curb online buying:  1) I can only buy 25$ (dollars) worth of items; they'll charge me an extra fee for the rest in addition to shipping and customs and taxes. These fees do not apply for gifts. Even with that extra fee it is still cheaper to buy online.  2) I can only receive two shippings a year. So I have to buy a very large amount of items all in one sitting for me to get my money's worth at Amazon or elsewhere.  The third problem is that a lot of the stuff I buy doesn't seem to be eligible for free shipping, so I have to pay for a lot of shipping fees too. I would have to buy about $35 worth of eligible items, but some of the eligible items don't ship to my country and others are considerably more expensive rendering the whole point moot.   All of these things separately are not so bad, I could get around those. But all three simultaneously is a real bitch :/"

RandomActsOfPolish,3aol7f,skelezombie,4,Mon Jun 22 10:15:53 2015 UTC,I think it depends on how thickly you put on each layer.
RandomActsOfPolish,3aol7f,Healsforhugs,3,Mon Jun 22 06:33:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you saw my Solar System nails, but I used:  *2 coats of OPI Nail Envy  *Black base x3 (I was at the bottom of the bottle so it wasn't easily applied)  *2-3 colors for each planet  *fairy dust coat  *seche vite to finish.   I've only had one chip, on my right thumb. So it's been...8-9 days? I think if you wrap your tips and make sure each layer dries before you put another coat, it's fine :3 a lot of people are surprised that my nails are real because my polish can thicken up, looking almost like acrylic build up. I take it as a compliment :p"

Nothing wrong with us keeping it simple sometimes!I think with how crazy we all get sometimes with our manis it's nice to just do something on the more simple side!

The fanciest i got was a long process of filled cupcakes for my birthday but hey special occassion n stuff haha.  So i constantly save out recipes that look good or sound good but then later i' like yeah i'll never make this lol. I did pull out a few shake/smoothie recipes for desserts, in this hot weather cold desserts win! also i got out a cannoli mousse recipe too. I got main meals covered, i have a chicken and bok choy stir fry to last me a couple days then i'm going to make a tomato based seafood soup! that'll last me like 5 more days so my grocery list this week is small so i'm contemplating a rotisserie chicken and making a chicken salad for a change here n there lol  Oh i noveled sorry haha i like talking about food! and bat next time you got it XD"

Those cupcakes sound amazing though! And you deserve something special for the bday! I made some funny bones recently and I kept exploding them with too much filling inside bc I didn't let the cake part cool enough I suppose haha they were awesome though and it was fun doing...the first time I did a filling in a dessert! Let me know how the cupcakes are..what filling is it? And you could novel to me about food whenever you want I enjoyed it and I can't gain weight just reading about all the yummy you're whipping up so it works for me haha!

She more worried about how she feels and what she'll do if it's cancer than with how he feels. It's going to be a long and awful weekend. Husband also remarked today while I was eating a small piece of brownies (made them for my dad) that here I am eating more fattening food. I swear I am so close to staging my own kidnapping. Or drinking an entire liquor store. Or both.   Also she said she wishes I'd stop taking law classes and take nail classes because she can't stand me pointing out the legal implications to the stupid shit she comes up with.

RandomActsOfPolish,3ageju,ootalia,3,Fri Jun 19 22:56:52 2015 UTC,Omg yay! You got the damask plate!I was wondering which plate you got from that collection!.I got the first one with the sewing stuff I wanted this one SO BAD! Lol awesome mani! I ended up getting a born pretty plate with some damask patterns bci was so sad I didn't get this one haha. I am going to live vicariously through you whenever you use this one though...k? Haha
RandomActsOfPolish,3ageju,BlueSprite714,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:44:15 2015 UTC,This plate was too pretty for me to pass up. I got others and I was asked to post pics so I need to do that. Totally cool to live vicariously. lol :-)
RandomActsOfPolish,3ageju,BlueSprite714,2,Sat Jun 20 15:09:02 2015 UTC,It really is though.. great choice. I'm obsessed with damask lately so I extra appreciate it! (I had to Google what it was called and am very proud of myself so need to use the word 'damask' as much as I can now lmao) My favorite pattern is houndstooth but for some reason damask is really doing something for me lately...classy as fuck haha.
RandomActsOfPolish,3ageju,BlueSprite714,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"lol Damask is very pretty. I LOVE historical dresses in damask. This is nerdy, but Ren-Faire is my jam because of the dresses.   I need to try a houndstooth stamp. I think I have a good one now. :-) The one I had before wasn't that great and didn't transfer great. BUt I think I got one on one of the plates I just ordered."
RandomActsOfPolish,3ageju,BlueSprite714,2,Sat Jun 20 15:23:49 2015 UTC,I'm such a nerd haha and I LOVE the renfaire! I wish I could dress like that everyday haha. I agree the dress are amazing. I didn't like allot of the houndstooth patterns I found on some plates too lol I got the pro plate from moyou with houndstooth in it but haven't gotten to try it out yet...I do love a good black and white pattern.
RandomActsOfPolish,3ageju,princessbubbleguum,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"I wish I could dress like that everyday too! I always tell my husband if we were rich I would have one closet of just historical clothes and a smaller closet for 'normal' clothes. He would probably come home and find me dressed in a historical dress daily. haha   There's a really good seamstress at the renfaire here and I've been lusting after a particular dress for about a year now. I need to save a lot of $$ to get it though. I have some gift cards to their store, but not enough. I have one dress from them, but it's not enough! lol"
RandomActsOfPolish,3ageju,Bunnynose7,2,Sat Jun 20 15:47:12 2015 UTC,Haha it's never enough! Lol I'm imagining another closet of historical clothes and drooling haha. I hope you get the dress it sounds like it's beautiful just by your excitement for it...I trust it's amazing!

They don't have a great selection on Amazon sadly...I wish they did. They DID have a promo for free international shipping s couple months ago and that's when I went and got a lot but they're so many more I just need haha. And it stinks that I had to pay an extra fee for converting from us to Europe money wise.I think it was 6 more bucks. I justified the free shipping as a good enough deal though lol! Awesome choices you made!

RandomActsOfPolish,3agpxd,BlueSprite714,2,Sat Jun 20 14:48:29 2015 UTC,It def looks more camo than dry brush which I love...I never would have guessed you did dry brush with it...it's an awesome idea!I never thought to do dry brush to get an effect like that...it makes the idea of trying camo seem a little easier! Idk how you thought of that but I love you for it haha. And it works out perfectly for me bc I'm not too experienced with that technique yet and I tend to leave too much on the brush...but to do this that might be okay! Haha

A few of my favorite indie polishes, without naming them all which is hard, are maybe: Crows Toes Jotunheim, Fairytale Finish Mischieveous Mermaid, Smitten Polish Not Your Mama's Easter Grass, Polish Alcoholic Aramis, Sweetheart Polish Minty Mouse, LynB Here on Earth and Our Little Infinity, KBShimmer Laugh Myself Lily and Sea You Around, Scofflaw Drop Dead Fred, Carpe Noctem Cosmetics Flounder, SugarTips Lacquer Fathoms Below, and Glam Polish Hat Trick 😥 My wishlists are about a mile long but some of my biggest indie lemmings are: Firecracker Lacquer Protector Pick-ups collection, FUN Lacquer Secret, Lemming Lacquers Wonderland collection, 5 of the KBShimmer summer polishes, Pretty and Polished Coral Grimes, Digital Nails Walking Dad trio...the list goes on and on. Brands I physically own more than one of and love: LynBDesigns, Lucky 13 Lacquer, Scofflaw, The Lady Varnishes, Firecracker Lacquer, KBShimmer, Pretty & Polished, Pretty Serious, Carpe Noctem Cosmetics, Dance Legend, Blue Sparrow Nail Polish, SugarTips Lacquer, Glam Polish, Sweetheart Polish, Mentality, Colors by Llarowe, Polish Me Silly, Delush, Love Angeline, Fairytale Finish Polish, Comet Vomit, Super Nails, Black Cat Lacquer, Drip Drop Nail Paint, and Creative Cuticles Nail polish but those aren't the only brands I love. If you really love indies and hate your wallet I highly recommend following brands on instagram, I can list them if you want but to save time for now I'll just say check my follow list on instagram (netters_nails). Facebook is another great place to follow brands and even join their brand appreciation groups. YouTubers like JessFace90, Misshollyberries, and Lindsay Does Nails plus many more do amazing swatch videos and have great instagrams....if you want to save your wallet avoid all of that! Haha"

Literally every polish by FUN lacquer. They just look so amazing, I honestly gasped the first time I saw them. But bottles are like 16$ and that's just.. Not something I can justify. I have a very part time job and just can't afford that kind of polish at this point in my life. Someday though!"

Plus the option to buy in 3 different sizes is a plus!  my lemming is probably takko spirited away.   for people who tried/failed or just plain didn't try but wanted the pipe dream polish a night in vegas neon set, I recommend the Vocab collex neon set by LynBDesigns. I used the yellow, Yolo, last night and its opaque in 3 thin coats WITHOUT solid undies.

RandomActsOfPolish,3aa5ss,skelezombie,2,Thu Jun 18 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"Yes! Definitely. Base coats can do many thing. Most importantly is help from the polish staining your nails, and give it something to adhere to. Top coat helps protect and make it look shiny :D. plus quick dry ones are most popular because you dont have to wait forever for your nails to dry."

RandomActsOfPolish,3aa5ss,silentwail,2,Thu Jun 18 14:51:55 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I'm a total sucker for corals, but it's definitely a tricky color. My recommendation would be to look at some random nail blogs and see if you can find one that has a skin tone similar to yours. Then you can get an idea of how different colors of polish look on them. There are a ton of nail polish bloggers and instagram swatchers out there!"

RandomActsOfPolish,3aa5ss,Miss-Omnibus,2,Thu Jun 18 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"Hello and welcome fellow dweller from the land down under! Ugh, this makes me so happy!!  My little set up I'm currently digging is Sally Hansen 'Nail Rehab' for the base coat. It's so damn good! It strengthens your nails and evens out any ridges, and definitely doesn't allow any staining from polish colours! It holds colour so well, it's just rad. And on top, I'm currently using the Sally Hansen 'Big shiny top coat'. It's pretty good, and you get a decent wear out of your polish before it starts chipping away. I'm so keen to buy a bottle of Glisten and Glow 'HK Girl fast dry top coat' though. But it's a bank killer with the shipping cost, haha.  I hope that helped and I'm so glad you're here! :) <3"

Which is stupid, because 1- I love my thighs and belly (normally), 2- yes I've been lazy lately so duh, that's what happens, and 3- in a week I'll be home and a week after that I'll be back to my normal because I'll have normal food. But it's still hard when you get stuck in that mindset. Whomp whomp. Tomorrow will be better. Tonight I will watch TV and snug with my man. Hope everyone is having a good day anyway!

RandomActsOfPolish,3a8x46,duckydoom,3,Thu Jun 18 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"Sigh. So the rest of this week is gonna be hard. As some of you on FB already know, we called and scheduled euthanasia for my old boy Jakey on Friday. The steroid shots did help a bit, but he's lost his fire and passion in his eyes, he's tired of being dragged around, and now just flops over on his side and refuses to make eye contact, basically saying ""no...no more please."" His legs and back are weak, he's messing himself, he's losing weight, has no real appetite even for his favorite treats... he's just telling us its time. And it sucks.   SO we're going to have a gathering of the people that he knows and loves, give him steak and treats and loves and cuddles, and have it done in our back yard so its a familiar place instead of a scary vet's office.    My husband is absolutely gutted... he's experiencing all of the emotions and questions that I've had over the past two months, but all at once. I've never seen him so emotional over something, he was rather stoic when my kitties went, but he pointed out that he's known Jake since I adopted him, he's been a part of our relationship at its worst and at its best, and he's really part of our family... part of us.   Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but thats really all I've got. I doubt I'll be around much after work hours today until next week - so you guys need to have a good weekend for me, ok?  I am brainstorming another charity contest though, thats keeping me somewhat occupied. Along the lines of the ones I've done before - donate to a charity and be entered. I'll have different tiers though, so more people can participate. Last time the threshold was $25 to enter, I think I'll do a $5, $15, $30 or something like that and let folks have their choice of Zoyas as prizes... or would you rather I use my friend's Cosmoprof account so I have access to OPI, CG, etc?"

I don't like doing everything online and all the stores are so far away from me that I just don't want to get involved and then end up having to half-ass it (pardon my french).

I did skip the last round entirely though. I love creating perfect boxes-years before all this redditing those were some of my favorite things to do ever! I do love online shopping the most, but by that I mean etsy. I like unique and handmade when I can find it! I'm letting my nails heal for a bit and then I plan on starting the stamping. I bought a Creative stamper and MoYou plates. I searched ""spreadsheet"" on RAOP and found the best Google doc templates, and started that process too for inventorying because I'm finally at that level about remembering what I have! :) I have not swatched at all and haven't bought any supplies for doing so yet. I'm considering it sometime though, because I really want a Helmer from IKEA and won't be displaying where I can really see polishes. For stamping I chose MoYou but I see all kinds of names out there, I just love textures, artwork, and paisley or mandala looking designs. Pretty sure I'll be just like you and stamping each time because I think my favorite mani is one with an accent nail :) So good to say hi to you! :)"

After contracting polio he first went into a state of denial, turning to quack medicine and extremely painful physical therapy in hopes of repairing his body; when that failed to fell into deep depression, then the fucker went on to become President and kicked Hitler's butt.  (Okay, Stalin, Churchill, and Truman played some role in the matter.)    FDR is responsible for:   The Civilian Conservation Core (To re-tree America) The Works Progress Administration (To re-employ America) The Tennessee Valley Authority.  (To electrify America) Social Security (To protect elderly Americans) The Securities and Exchange Comission (To prevent another Great Depression) Killing Hitler (Not really, but kinda'.)   To go from suicidally depressed to kicking ass and taking names is inspirational as all hell to me.  FDR is da' man.    Edit: Wait... this isn't /r/GetMotivated ...  Uhm.  FDR also had fingers, so I bet he had fingernails, so.... I'm no good at this.  This is a picture of a cat."

RandomActsOfPolish,3a2g76,BlueSprite714,2,Tue Jun 16 19:07:33 2015 UTC,Yay for ghetto parcels! That made me lol. I need to know what you mean though? Are you guys talking about cuticle oil? I'm too nosy for my own good haha
RandomActsOfPolish,3a2g76,BlueSprite714,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:54:33 2015 UTC,Haha I'm all about getting in everyone's business so I feel you! ;) it's ghetto because I have no money for shippin supplies so it's a used package with scotch tape. Inside is a kbshimmer cuticle oil pen and an emerald and ask cuticle oil roller ball. Akatz posted about looking for a new oil but emerald and ash are closed down for a bit and I had some I offered to let her have so she could find a company and application she liked! :)
RandomActsOfPolish,3a2g76,BlueSprite714,2,Tue Jun 16 20:12:05 2015 UTC,Aww awesome! I just got some peach cuticle oil from Lynbs sale. It smells yummy! I'm so use to burts bees cuticle cream I'm not used to the oil. I just feel like I'll touch my face and get this yucky oil feeling haha.I guess the pens help it from getting everywhere? Are there any secret tips to using oil? The one I got is in a polish bottle so I rub it in after I dab some on. I don't like oil staying on my hands though and if I wash themi feel like I just washed off what I put on my cuticles lmao.

RandomActsOfPolish,3a1htt,lynlyn6,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:32:27 2015 UTC,I really like purples but I love all colours really. I've been getting into orange a lot lately actually. It's something that I never really looked at that much but then I picked up OPI's Juice Bar Hopping on sale at Sally for like $2. Its so pretty... I've picked up a few more orange shades since then. haha... I'd guess China Glaze is probably my favorite brand since I have the most of those! Big OPI fan as well (but who isn't). haha... how about you?

RandomActsOfPolish,3a1gwf,hislilmissy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of questions. The first being, how can I grown my nails out?! Healthy and strong! =) Secondly, until I can grown them out, what would be a good shape for my nail type? Any tips on shaping my nails? Why are they shaped so funny on top? I've noticed one ALWAYS grows in wavy, no matter how I cut or clip it!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3a1gwf,BlueSprite714,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"for some reason i can't see the picture on imgur so i don't know if its me or if it isn't linked right... anyway so as for growing them out strong... i take biotin (a good healthy diet with protein def helps though on a sidenote!) and use nail envy. There are other nail strengtheners out there too but i haven't used many others that i would be able to recommend but maybe the other ladies will know more about other kinds. Also i think moisturizing and using cuticle cream/oil is REALLY important in the upkeep of nails. I like to make sure i moisturize and put on the cuticle cream at night before bed too and throw some gloves on. Personally i love burts bees lemon cuticle cream, you don't need too much and it lasts forever. This all really helps me with keeping them strong and growing them out. I am really rough with my nails/hands though so i have had some bad rips and breaks lately and had to file them down really short. so my nails right now aren't a great example but i have to say my routine def helps them! Oh and advice i never take and SHOULD or i wouldn't be dealing with breaks and rips right now is that it is a good idea to use GLOVES when cleaning and doing dishes. The water saturates your nails and makes them more susceptible to damage (also the cleaning products can be damaging too). As for your shape i can't see the picture and i myself just tend to shape them squoval/square bc thats how they grow and its easy to just file straight instead of me trying to shape them haha i think i would mess up shaping them so i'm not the one to help anyone with that! lol well thats my 2 cents i can't really think of much else but thats how i got my nails in better condition!"
RandomActsOfPolish,3a1gwf,BlueSprite714,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:45:21 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest part of mine growing in funny is because they're attached funny. Like the part when the skin meets the nail at the top, that's wavy. It's weird.  Why are cuticles important? What's the difference btwn cuticle cream and normal lotion?   I usually have gloves. But mine go through hell and usually break in a week or two. Gets pricey"
RandomActsOfPolish,3a1gwf,BlueSprite714,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:03:28 2015 UTC,When i had to grow my nails in from biting it took a long time to get that part of the nail to look right because my nails were so short i had to get them to attach to the nail bed again lol. The quick of the nail is where it is attatched to the finger and then theres the nail that is white... the tips. To get that even line you just have to be careful with cleaning under your nails and trying not to push the skin back that is trying to attach to your nail. It took me a while to get a bigger nail bed and even now if im  scraping under there or something jabs in i get an uneven line until the nail attaches again!  Cuticles are REALLY important imo for growing stronger healthier nails. Under the cuticle is where the new nail growth happens so you want healthy cuticles to protect that new nail growth. You want to take care of your cuticles so that the new nail growth is as healthy and strong as it can be so when the nails grow out that growth is strong and healthy since it will eventually end up at the end of your fingertips! Keeping the cuticles moisturized and nourished helps healthier growth occur.  If the cuticles are always dry the nail isnt getting what it needs to grow strong so your nails can become brittle and susceptible to damage.   Cuticle cream is more aimed towards nourishing the cuticles so they contain ingredients that help aid in nail growth or avoiding the cuticles from drying out. They are just formulated more specifically for nails to grow stronger. (there are a lot of cuticle oils too i just happen to love burts bees cuticle cream and its not as messy or oily feeling as oils are and rubs in easier for ME) BUT some good lotion certainly helps as well it just may not have those specific ingredients. I feel that some really intense lotions for extremely dry chapped hands/skin and things along those lines work really well too though. I like using aquaphor or cutemol or stuff like that for my hands and also rub it into the cuticles.  So its not like a cuticle cream is totally a necessity but its nice lol. (and you can use oils you already have at home too if you wanted that extra moisture or care at night or something like that! its all preference i guess!)  ok i think thats all i can think of lemme know if you have any more questions!

They smell strong and that's off putting for some but for the price they're pretty good. I'd say just throw another coat on and it will be more opaque.

RandomActsOfPolish,39x1lo,BlueSprite714,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on individuals who may have worse (like me) cuticles. Before I push them back, I use it to remove all the dead skin off my nail. One of the quickest ways to look pro is to clean up the edges of your polish and avoid cuticles. Polish clings to the cuticle on your nail which makes that difficult! I use it roughly once every two weeks? Some can just soak in hot water and push it back, but this really gets it all good and gone! Make sense?"

I enjoy camping but my style of camping is different from the bf's family. Still had a good time though. Aside that I am sore as hell and sunburned right on top of where I'm sore so I can't massage it. Oh and my bf dropped my ecig in the lake. :(  Going to be doing my nails tomorrow and I'm definitely ready to have something on them. I hate how they feel naked. Lol

Me and a friend tried fixing it one day for over 6 hours with no luck. Got an external drive hoping to put windows on it just long enough to get my files off the old one and reformat and completely wipe the old one and it wouldn't let us. 8 hours of trying including going into the command prompt and typing in all sorts of nonsense....nothing. Finally my dad had to buy me a new hard drive and I had to restart everything. We are gonna try and pull everything off it next month when I go to my parents house but its not for sure we can. So I might have lost all my pictures of my kids that aren't up on facebook AND all of my school work. I lost a 20 slide power point presentation I was almost finished with that was due sunday night. I had to rush and do ALL of my work for the week sunday including two essays.  I got one essay done but the other had to be done in the school's online forum and I was almost done and writting out the citations when windows popped up a thing about my copy of windows not beign valid and it made me lose EVERYTHING I had just written...about 800 words, pictures and citations GONE/ I am just livid! I wrote my teacher a message telling her but I am sure she wont believe me since it was like half an hour before everything was due and I have already been late on stuff twice because my family seems to keep catching every freaking illness known to man kind this semester! I even sent her pictures I took of my screwed up computer screen lol SO hopefully she doesn't mark off too much cuz I am not doing shit tonight, I'll rewrite it tomorrow and then redo my powerpoint. It just sucks so hard!!!  Such a bad freaking week!!!"
RandomActsOfPolish,39vkk3,Maevora06,2,Mon Jun 15 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I have zero claim on being an IT person, so I'm crossing my fingers this works for you... Go on Amazon and search for an ""IDE to USB converter"" or ""Serial ATA to USB converter"". Some converters have ports for both IDE or SATA, and that's fine too! If you don't know what kind of hard drive your old hard drive is, get the kind with both.  Basically, once you have your new hard drive installed and running windows, you can plug in your old hard drive just like an external drive with the USB cable. You should be able to access your old hard drive's files. This worked for me when my laptop fried. I really hope this works for you!!"

You know through  all this bullshit that happened I've made some friends online who reached out, and I love it. ive been stressing about the what if's and about what's gonna happen. Those things haven't happened yet though. I need to start focusing on what's in front of me. What I can do today. Someone told me that, and it's right.  So that's what I'm going to do. No more being sad over stupid things way in the future. So today is my fresh start. I've also decided to start with a brand new pretty pair of panties. Because, well, I thought it would help some how,  and I fucking love new panties :)"
RandomActsOfPolish,39vkk3,dnd1980,2,Mon Jun 15 11:14:51 2015 UTC,"I hope you start feeling better and special in your new undies! A positive outlook can go a long way. Can I suggest something that works really well for me? I write down something good every day, I'm on my second year of doing this. Even if it's a horrible day, I'll write 'Took a nap' or 'Ate a tasty sandwich'. Just focusing on something besides the negative has helped me a ton."
RandomActsOfPolish,39vkk3,skelezombie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:41:11 2015 UTC,Yes! Suggestions are much needed!  I'm so sick of being sad and nervous for the past few weeks lol. Need to start trying to be positive and taking it one day at a time! I'm totally gonna try your suggestion. So you write down something positive that you did that day? Or wake up and just think of something positive to write down?
RandomActsOfPolish,39vkk3,duckydoom,2,Mon Jun 15 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"I write something that happened, a way to see the good in the suckage. I've got an evernote list on my phone and an alarm set for 8pm daily so I don't forget. That way something probably happened that I can write, but if not, it gives me a few hours to do something before bed. Like for today, I'll probably write something like 'made some banana muffins'. You could also use a calendar or a notebook, but I travel a lot so digital is the way to go for me."

My main issue is like 0 motivation. So somehow I think if I have an app to answer to, maybe it'll help? Lol I dno. Some people were talking about something called habitrpg,  buuuut I didn't like it. It's like a game you make with your tasks or something."
RandomActsOfPolish,39vkk3,duckydoom,2,Mon Jun 15 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"Oh I've never heard of that one. Evernote is a simple but great app that stores text docs/notes etc, but you can access it on anything, so sometimes I'll make notes on my phone, and sometimes on my computer or through a browser and all my stuff is there, so I rarely miss days. If I do forget, I just go back later and fill them in."

I've been up for 2 hours already... usually at this time (6:15 AM), I'd have been up for maybe half an hour... I had my alarm set to go to the gym and almost went ""ugghhh eff it..."" and then I got a dietbet notification that /u/Miss-Omnibus is already kicking my ass, so I got up and went and worked out.   The weekend was kind of busy - we went and saw my bff's fiancee's band play on Friday and stayed up way too late. After 3 hours of sleep, got up and did the Color me Rad run, then did a crap ton of shopping, then hung out with my BFF and her fiancee (it was also our 6 year wedding anniversary). We slept almost all day, I colored my hair back to my natural shade, and we did a day late anniversary dinner for which I made a strawberry peach pie. It was delicious.   Next week school starts, so I'm trying to get as much crafty stuff/big yard projects done as I possibly can. We'll see how that goes.  Hope all of you have a great week <3"

And 6 years for a laptop is an awesome time for a computer to last. Mine is 3 years old at this point and it's just silly annoying issues.

Like local channels only but hey I get to watch Jeopardy again! I got a mani pedi and the salon was really nice, I went to the Bath and Bodyworks Semiannual sale and got some awesome body wash, handsoap, hand sanitizer, and lotion (13 items for $30). I also made an awesome veggie fried rice on saturday with Japanese Yum Yum Sauce (that is literally what it says on the bottle).   Bad - My sister put my Mom's cat down yesterday (the cat was really old and sick). Manicure chipped same day (It was a better deal to get both versus one). It always happens with salon manis, they look great but they don't tip wrap and the top coat they use is shit. I also stubbed my toe so bad I lost part of a toenail. Also my home laptop no longer has sound and we need a new air conditioner. Last night my budget went from ok to...well I have no money for the next 2 weeks. Which is such a bummer because I wanted to do the weightloss contest. Oh well."

Then as I paint I keep an orange wood stick handy so when I get polish on my skin I can wipe it off with the stick and onto the Kleenex. If its still not perfect when you are done you can wrap a small piece of cotton around the end of the stick dip it in some polish remover and go back and clean up.

He was off stage for a bit, in which the rest of the band continued to play and then he came back and rocked out for 2 hours. He had to be in so much pain and it's amazing that he came back and continued on rather than going to the hospital to get treated.  I'm wondering what this means for the concert I'm supposed to go to on July 16.  One of our cat's died last night. She hid under my nephews bed and it wasn't fun pulling her out.

RandomActsOfPolish,39it4o,princessbubbleguum,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:59:20 2015 UTC,"None of those ingredients should expire - OR do that to your fingers. In fact, because the solvents are more volatile than the water, if the bottle was leaking or something, you would lose the alcohol and ethyl acetate first, meaning you'd get more watery, less effective remover over time.  Do you have problems with certain polishes that use ethyl acetate as their primary solvent?"

So my night is all messed up since I slept from like 5pm-9pm. It's mostly gone now, but still really annoying.   I can't remember how I found out, but Sims 2 is pretty much no longer for sell by EA games and last year they gave out the whole Sims 2 collection for free if you had the base game on your EA profile. Well, I did a live chat with an EA person since that deal is no longer available and was able to show I used to own the Sims 2 games so they gave me the whole collection again! So much time is going back into that game."

I asked for her not to cut it straight across (I hate when it's blunt and looks like I just got it cut) and I didn't even realize that she never handed me a mirror to look at the back.

We already had nothing to spare now we really don't. I made him stay somewhere else tonight since we can't afford an actual divorce yet. My mom is helping me with a gift from both of us which is humiliating but this ""friend"" isn't the type to understand my situation or my lack of gift. Honestly I don't even know why I'm friends with her anymore aside from the fact she is basically the leader of my group of friends. Then my best friend who hasn't really been there for me lately since he's in the honeymoon phase of a new relationship called me completely freaked out and threatening that ""he didn't know what he was going to do"" because ""he fucked shit up"" with his girlfriend. So like always I dropped everything to go talk to him and now he's doing better but that's a mess and now I'm going to get like 4 hours of sleep if I'm lucky.

RandomActsOfPolish,39edjn,Aerys1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"Well the trick is it isn't a diet, it really is a lifestyle change. On it you will lose weight and feel amazing. Off it... you will get weight gain and feel shitty. Although I don't frequent the subreddit i do know of /r/xxketo for women folk. Women who have pcos often speak highly of keto to help not only the weight symptoms but other things such as skin issues and insulin issues associated with pcos.   The basic principle of keto is keep carbs to a minimum, hit your protein target and eat fat to fill you up.  Chrck out the faq on /r/keto :)"

I need new glasses but can't afford those at the moment either..  And then my gender-fluidness has been causing me some more mental strain lately.  Like seriously, I'm 25 and biologically male and yet I'm having severe urges to have a child.  And not just as a parent.  As in dreaming of being female and pregnant.  And that felt right.  It's wreaking havoc with what little positive I've been able to see in my life.  To know that that just isn't medically possible at all right now.  BLEH.    I just need to get a hold of myself.  I need to get a job, move back out of my parents house.. being back here after having moved out for several years is just depressing, I need to lose a significant amount of weight.. I'm down like 23lbs right now.. but I have quite a bit more to go to get into my supposedly healthy range for my sex, age, and height.  Pretty much right now I have no stress relief and I'm in an extremely stressful environment.

We don't speak to them any more. The brother is actually the worst person I have ever met and the world would be a better place without him. The wife is also shitty. They are long time drug addicts and terrible parents. We've had custody of the kids several time. They just got over a dcf case recently infact. After the Case was over they went back to drugs, this time shooting up which they had never done before. This is how she got the infection. apparently its been infected and bothering her for a while, but she just decided to go to the hospital to get it checked yesterday. I feel horrible for the 3 kids. They deal with so much as is and now they are stuck with just their dad who is a horrible person. I'm sure by now the kids are able to fend for themselves for the most part but the father is useless. There is nothing we can do because he refuses to speak to us. Ugh I kinda wish it was him in this situation instead, maybe then the wife would have a chance to get straight. The kids should have been taken from that home permanently long ago."

Or you could call and leave a tip without them knowing it was you.  I'm sorry you have the worry.  It sucks being close to certain people when the rest of the family is why you were there and left in the first place.
RandomActsOfPolish,39edjn,blacqbird,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:57:50 2015 UTC,They just got over a child services case. The system here is so fucked. I wouldn't be surprised if they got another case but he normally just doesn't let them in the house and then they don't/cant/wont do anything until they get multiple more complaints and take it to the next step. I'm hoping the sister is involved and helping out or something. We don't talk to her either but we heard she took the kids not long ago for a weekend so hopefully she is making sure the kids have what they need.
RandomActsOfPolish,39edjn,hollysglad,2,Thu Jun 11 13:02:27 2015 UTC,Are you in the states? If so what state? I agree child services is screwed up in most... If not all. They don't always act in the children's benefit and they leave children with family they shouldn't for too long. Sometimes they give the parents too many chances to prove they're fit parents and that does nothing for the children's well being. I hope your kiddos are being taken care of.
RandomActsOfPolish,39edjn,blacqbird,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:08:42 2015 UTC,"South Florida. More specifically miami dade county. there has been a lot of BS with DCF not doing their job in the past few years so it was just shocking to me how the last case was handled. they were in the case for almost 2 yrs, failing drugs tests the majority of the time, living in a hotel, and still kept the kids. Never even did any sort of in-treatment program which is what was originally recommended. Fucking mind boggling."

RandomActsOfPolish,39euru,MostlyALurkerBefore,5,Thu Jun 11 06:47:07 2015 UTC,"Could be a few things. Bottled room temp water is best. Some polishes work better than others, I've had luck with China glaze."
RandomActsOfPolish,39euru,batdalek,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:57:29 2015 UTC,That makes sense. So far I've tried a few of the cheaper brands.
RandomActsOfPolish,39euru,netters_nails,2,Thu Jun 11 20:36:06 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/batdalek it can depend on a lot of things. I always always use bottled room temp water. Sometimes you can tap the sides of the container to make a polish spread but not all polishes are created equal in marbling. Start with a straight creme until you get the technique down. I've had a lot of luck with Sinful Colors especially but there's no one brand where they all work. What container are you using? That could be factoring in as well. Don't do it by a fan or air vent and don't use quick dry polishes. When you do get the polishes to spread remember to drag your tool starting at a few rings in and pulling out with a few rings to go because the edges of the design with be too dry and will gunk up the tool.
RandomActsOfPolish,39euru,netters_nails,2,Thu Jun 11 12:29:55 2015 UTC,I think my water was too cold as well...  I'm using a plastic cup; is there something better?

RandomActsOfPolish,39euru,prcsngrl,2,Thu Jun 11 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"The consistancy of the polish makes a big difference. Is the polish thick in the bottle or is it thin? Also it matters about the temperature of the water. Room temperature works best, if the water is too cold it will make the polish not spread."

Purina is a great food company. They do tons of research with their diets and as a veterinarian, I use it myself, too. There's a ton more I could go into, but something that's really annoying as a vet is how well-intentioned but uninformed people go on about how ""shitty"" pet food is with corn in it, and I'm like no, stop right there, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. So yah, that ex-friend of yours, ugh.  Anyway, that all said, I'm sorry you lost your friend. That sucks. Truly, it does. You've got a friend in me (cue Toy Story music). I am glad we are friends.

RandomActsOfPolish,399a0b,Ididntknowiwas,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:44:55 2015 UTC,The cookie brownies look amazing! Will you share the recipe? The blondies look nice too but knowing they've got peanut butter things in them puts me off!
RandomActsOfPolish,399a0b,duckydoom,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:52:53 2015 UTC,Sorry if it's formatted poorly I'm on mobile at the moment. here is the recipe. I added 2 tablespoons extra of butter in the brownie batter because it was super thick. Boxed brownie mix normally calls for oil but this recipe used butter. So I followed it but had to add more.

RandomActsOfPolish,396e8g,Ididntknowiwas,2,Tue Jun 9 16:58:31 2015 UTC,This is when you need 10 stamper heads so you can make enough all at once
RandomActsOfPolish,396e8g,princessbubbleguum,2,Tue Jun 9 17:27:05 2015 UTC,i was just thinking that!

RandomActsOfPolish,396e8g,Zoobles88,2,Tue Jun 9 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"I use a ziploc freezer bag, cut it so it's just a single thickness, put over my nails and trace the outlines with a sharpie, then turn it over, throw down a coat of clear, stamp onto that, color in as I want, put another coat of clear on it, let it dry, then peel the ""decals"" up with tweezers and put on."

RandomActsOfPolish,396e8g,not-gonna-tell,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:36:05 2015 UTC,"It's not clear to me in the pic, so I wanted to ask, hope it's okay.  Do you put a coat or two down on your stamper before you pick up the stamp (in this case, the black rose outline)?  Otherwise, I can't see how it would peel off well.  I have done decals on a plastic bag before with moderate success and that's what I did."
RandomActsOfPolish,396e8g,missus_b,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:20:54 2015 UTC,You do not put a layer of clear on your stamper before you pick up the image. Just after you've filled it all in. It does pick up just fine. The layers of polish sort of meld together when you cover the whole thing with top coat.
RandomActsOfPolish,396e8g,qwazy,2,Tue Jun 9 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, at the end!!  I'm glad I did ask.  I would have totally messed that up.  Thank you so much!"

RandomActsOfPolish,396eel,Panda_Pops,3,Tue Jun 9 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"/u/strawberrytrash has it right about using your nails as tools. I've noticed that mine also do this when I clip instead of file, or file back and forth. Also when I leave polish on to chip - I have to take it off right when it starts to lift/chip. Strengtheners can help, but I've found that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
RandomActsOfPolish,396eel,choco-early,3,Tue Jun 9 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"My nails do that too, and for similar reasons. My advice is to never have naked nails. Think of it like a falconer's glove - it doesn't have to be pretty, but it should always be present.   I use Nail Envy and find that it works extremely well for me. They even have one specifically for brittle/peeling nails, although I've never found it to help more than just the regular stuff. Always keep a coat of it on your nails, even if you don't have time or circumstances for a fancy manicure. I use it as base coat under regular polish too.   Also, ""wrap"" your tips - fold a little polish over the ends of your nails onto the underside. It will really help with the peeling.   You may also find that using a nice hand lotion once a day - right before you go to bed might be easiest - will help, too."
RandomActsOfPolish,396eel,punkrockscience,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice, I'll see if i can keep up with a coat of nail envy at the very least :D"
RandomActsOfPolish,396eel,strawberrytrash,2,Tue Jun 9 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"my nails like to peel around the tip as well, and its usually when i catch myself using my nails as 'tools'. typing with my fingertips as opposed to finger pads, using the cash register at work, peeling stickers, etc. I keep a file with me and file it down before it has the chance to peel or break off.   also, keep a good strengthener on them. personally, I've never used Nail Envy, but Essie's Millionails is what works for me. typically for manis I'll put Millionails, Orly Bonder, and then my polish.   I find that keeping them polished or at least covered in base coat/strengthener cuts a lot of splitting and breakage.   hope this helped!! <3"

RandomActsOfPolish,396eel,strawberrytrash,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:46:44 2015 UTC,"not stupid at all! it's a rubberized bonder that just helps polish adhere, while making removal later easier, especially when you're using glitter coats."

Fortunately I haven't had to break my crutches out yet and the kids are too big to be held.  I'll be getting my appointments set up soon and my handicap tag renewed (expired in Nov).

RandomActsOfPolish,393wel,batdalek,2,Tue Jun 9 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"What is do is this:  I use normal latex free make up wedges.  I use the flat end, and add my colors on to there. I make sure to overlap the colors a bit so it helps blend on the nail.  Once all my colors are on I dab it onto the nail. Just like take the sponge and dab, dab, dab. I move the sponge up and then down slightly as a dab to help with the blending more.  Don't dab too much or you'll just end up picking the polish up off your nail. So do some dab, move on to the next nail and so on until your hand is done. Then go back and dab all the nails over again. Repeat until you have the desired pigmentation. And don't forget to reapply polish to the sponge as needed. I'll see if I can do a picture tutorial or something."

Those those unfamiliar, an internship is advanced training that some vets choose to do after vet school, usually for those who want to go on to a residency to become a specialist, or get more experience to practice in a specific area (like emergency medicine, which is what I want to do).  They are notoriously extremely poor paying (boo) and very intense hours-wise (70-90 hrs/wk, eek), but damn do they help doctors become awesome! They can be done either in a university or private practice. I'm done with academia, so mine is in a private practice! This week will be mostly orientation-type things (so hopefully less intense, lol), and I'll get my schedule and stuff. Probably start seeing patients next week.

I've wanted to relax and drink, be irresponsible, and let go, but I haven't really been able to because I need to be sober to cart my dog up and down the stairs. I pulled a muscle in my back, so I'm limping around everywhere. Anyway, husband went fishing with his family, so I got to just laze around the house. Sucky part of it though is when he was bringing our canoe back, the canoe holder we made thunked the rearview glass and shattered it. Sooo... now we get to pay for a new rearview window. Blergh. I'm blaming retrograde Mercury ha.   Jakey is still doing good, and I'm gonna touch base with the vet today to see if we can do another steroid shot, or how often I should be getting them for him. I found a full body harness for him with handles on the hips and shoulders to make it easier to take him up and down the stairs  - he hates his hip sling something fierce. Cant blame him, it squarshes his weiner. 0_0  This weekend my BFF and her boyfriend are coming over. He's playing his first public show in forever, so we're all going in support. Should be fun. Saturday is my 6th wedding anniversary, and also I'm doing the Color Me Rad 5k... so that should be fun :D  Hope everyone else has a good week ahead of you, whether or not its planned."

Saturday was pretty relaxing (made dinner for the boyfriend and did laundry) until my roommate came in at 11PM with a bunch of people to move her furniture (she forgot 3 pieces of but as long as she eventually get's those I don't care when she does it). She almost tore off the banister of the stairwell moving her couch. She also gouged the wall with her couch but luckily I can repair it and my couch is moving to that wall so it will not be visible.  Sunday boyfriend and I drove to my dad's to pick up our new kitchen table. It's awesome, made of maple and sturdy as all hell! We then went to my grandmother's house and she gave us some silverware and a whole new set of dishes and bowls! I was so excited since ours were my first roommates and they are sort of...ugly. She also gave us a quilt my mom made that she found in the attic and a small table for us to put our microwave on. We also ordered our new couch and all of our Ikea furniture and went to a game shop and wandered around the mall. I feel like I need a weekend from my weekend.   My nails held up rather well, just a few small chips. I am super pissed that my pink zoya (I cant remember the name) is super chunky and thick. It's my only bottle of zoya that has gotten like this and it's newer than the rest. Oh well."

It works pretty much every time if you happen to be using Mundo de Unas stamping polish, but actually works pretty well with most other regular polish too.   This also works way better if you have your base color and good quick dry top coat totally dry before attempting."

I have been waiting my entire life for that.  That certainly helped me forget the stresses of the last couple of days.

I'm not sure how we're going to handle that, but hopefully we'll be able to find a way.    I hope you're all doing well! <3"

I've looked at a million different ways to do them and I just not  finding anything to do.  Maybe I need to buy a new polish. sometimes that helps.  I also had a crappy week.  I started out good but on Thursday I had an interview that I totally sucked at.  It was bad. I could not form a sentence, I felt like I was talking in point form.  I just couldn't think I was so close of standing up and walking out half way through.  I was getting so frustrated. Today when I went into work I really did not want to be there.  I just want to eat junk and watch movies all day. I am so ready for a day off. I get one on Sunday though so that is exciting I guess.  Hope everyone has a good weekend!"

RandomActsOfPolish,38ppuv,frankiecat_,4,Fri Jun 5 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"Okay so I started with wheels but adding new polishes was a nightmare. Then switched to white swatch sticks on the giant screws they come with organized by solid color, then by effects polishes, then effect toppers, and then glitters and multi colored polishes by color. Indies have their own rings and are organized by brand and then collections within each brand. Eventually I just had too many and it was getting hard to add new sticks so I switched them into mason jars in the same pattern. I really liked that for a while but my ocd wouldn't let me just leave them free in the jars so each one was organized. That became a pain and my husband kept knocking them over to get his winter coat. Then it was suggested to me to use these chains and I love it! By connecting mutiple you can make the rings as big as you want and you can move the chain to open it wherever you need to add a stick instead of  having to take them all off. I also switched to clear sticks so I could paint the bottom of the nail part and be able to see the natural finish but also see what it would look like topcoated from the top."

RandomActsOfPolish,38ppuv,netters_nails,4,Sat Jun 6 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"I use clear swatch sticks and organize by color. I'm just using binder rings and can slide the sticks over to the other side of the opening if I need to add in the middle. I have magnetic hooks on the side of my helmer to hold my rings. Stamping polishes and toppers are on separate rings, but my holos are mixed in with the color rings.  For stamping polishes, I put a 1/2 cm piece of tape horizontal across the swatch and paint the top half white and bottom black, leaving the center clear and stamp over the entire thing so I can see light, dark, and still hold up other colors underneath. :)"

I keep the sticks all lined up in a little bin. They determine the order of the polishes in my giant, enormous, ridiculous wall rack, since they all dry a little different than they look in the bottle. It makes figuring out what color I want to use less daunting than staring at a wall of polishes.  As for more detail, I have them categorized by color (red, red-orange, orange) and those go in order from light to dark within those groups. The multichromes are included in those groups by their main color, and any glitter that is just one color. Flakies are separate at the end, and multi-colored glitters too."

So far she's only stolen 3 things of mine (totaling less than $10 so I'm not going to make a stink about it). Last night I separated out our pots and pans and silverware so she cant take anything else that isn't hers. Her food is out of the apartment (except a few things in the fridge) so I have so much more room in the pantry/fridge and freezer! I'm so excited for organizing! Boyfriend and I have picked out all of the new furniture, bought and put together the new coffee table and my dad is giving us a kitchen table this weekend! I am excited for her to get her couch out so I can order the one we picked out. It's so much bigger than the one I have now and it's super comfy! Boyfriend is calling the internet company and next friday we take my roommate off of the electric and add my boyfriend. It's all happening!!! Even though my boyfriend cant move in until August for family reasons I am so excited for him to start moving small things into the apartment.   Tonight I'm planning on doing a quick grocery store run, cleaning the apartment (which is so much easier now that she's leaving) and doing my nails. I'm thinking maybe bright pink.

I'm going to New York City next week for a class, though! I'm trying to figure out what sightseeing (and tasty noms) I can pack in during the evenings without spending an arm and a leg. I'm staying somewhat close to the Empire State Building. I'm excited - I've never been to NYC. Anyone have any suggestions? Or places I should try to stop by for shopping, too? :D"
RandomActsOfPolish,38mjty,lochnessie15,2,Fri Jun 5 12:43:01 2015 UTC,"If you like museums, check out the museum of natural history and/or the metropolitan museum of art. Do NOT pay the suggested admission process of $25/22. They are suggested, you can pay whatever you want. I usually pay $1 or 2 especially since I only go for a short time. What's nice is that you also have central park right between those museums."
