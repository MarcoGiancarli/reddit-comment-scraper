Forty years later, I still remember eating french fries smothered in Horsey sauce, though I couldn't tell you who was sitting across the table from me.

The reason why McD's truncated their menu is preciseley this reason. YOu can't expect someone making 8.50 an hour to be able to memorize 30 menu items and make them well.  All day breakfast is fucking brutal on workers and managers. This is why you can't go to Jack In the Box or Bojangles during certain times.

I worked in fast food for 7 years straight, and memorized the recipes for probably at least 1000 things by the end of it. Sure someone CAN remember a lot of things associated with their job. The point is that for an easy, minimum wage position you should never have to rely on someone caring to make food effectively.  Working as a barista or at Subway, for instance (done both) you find the recipes to be somewhat modular. There are patterns that aid in memorization. At Hardees or with McDonald's old menu that simply was not the case. There were 45 types of meat alone at Hardees, wheras you have an automatic espresso machine and a selection of syrups you mostly recombine. Even assuming someone gives a fuck, with McDonald's turnover they can't afford to have someone learn for a month. That's just it."

I'd also suggest switching to steak if you don't want to be picking barbacoa shreds out of your teeth.

fastfood,3cyp03,corgonin,4,Sun Jul 12 02:14:06 2015 UTC,"Obviously the fastest food items are the quick sandwiches, Cheeseburger, Double Cheeseburger, Mcdouble, McChicken those type of items. Making some of the premium sandwiches takes longer like the Big Mac, Quarter Cheese, Premium Chicken Sandwiches and the Premium Wraps take the longest to make along with the salads sometimes."
fastfood,3cyp03,clochejar,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:35:02 2015 UTC,Why does a quarter cheese take longer than a double cheeseburger?
fastfood,3cyp03,TehWildMan_,2,Sun Jul 12 22:04:14 2015 UTC,"Quarter buns are less frequently ordered, and despite official policy, a few extra regular buns may be buffered during lunch peak, shaving 20 seconds off assembly time.     Due to the manipulation of cheese and beef, the actual assembly of a double cheese does take longer.  However, double cheeseburgers are easy to assemble in large quantities.   Also, everyone hates that customer who orders more than two premium wraps when only one side of the table is open."
fastfood,3cyp03,BeerSnobsUnited,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:36:24 2015 UTC,"With any sandwich we have to toast the bun in the toaster and sometimes we don't always have a Quarter bun ready like we do with the regular buns. Then the only difference is the type of onions, and the the beef patties which both get two, but the Quarter Poinder gets the Quarter beef. It takes longer with the Double Cheese because we have to put the beef patty down and then a piece of cheese and the a beef patty and then the last piece of cheese and then wrap it."

fastfood,3cyp03,SylvesterLundgren,2,Sun Jul 12 04:20:53 2015 UTC,Everyone talks about there being a secret menu item but I don't think we really had one. You can order whatever you like and we'll make it for you though. I think it's just one of those made up things. But you can order a sandwich anyway you like so it's kinda like the secret menu. We'll make it for you because we don't want to turn you away and lose your money.

fastfood,3cyp03,ShadyBiz,4,Sun Jul 12 00:22:39 2015 UTC,I kinda answered that in my response to the other question but yes you can. But you have to say only the sandwich. You don't know how many times I've taken orders and they say a number and I ask what they'd like to drink and they say no just the sandwich and I have to clear what they just said and start over. So you can say that or just don't say the numbers if you're just getting the sandwich just state the sandwich that you'd like. Either one is fine to me just be specific when you're ordering
fastfood,3cyp03,emkay99,2,Sun Jul 12 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I can't tell you how many times I've said, ""I'd like a big mac"" only to get the screen show #1 and the response, ""What would you like to drink?""  Basically saying ""just the sandwich"" is the optimal solution to both customer and employee error."
fastfood,3cyp03,gtownbingo100,3,Sun Jul 12 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess it's how you're trained also. I'm trained to know if you say that you want a Big Mac then you want just the sandwich, though occasionally I might ask if you'd like the meal with that to first, make sure you don't want the meal, and second try to up-sell to get you to pay more money to us. But mostly if you say the sandwich name you don't want the meal. But yes to reduce error on both sides it might be sure to state you just want the sandwich. It just depends on who you're talking to."
fastfood,3cyp03,Juggernauticall,0,Sun Jul 12 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"Why do they call burgers ""sandwiches"" at fast food restaurants. I suppose technically they are sandwiches but they're burgers first and foremost, are they not?"
fastfood,3cyp03,NoCardio_,2,Sun Jul 12 03:01:23 2015 UTC,"We call them sandwiches because not all of them are ""burgers"".

fastfood,3cyp03,joshuacrook,2,Sun Jul 12 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like most of the practices that we do are hygenic but they are times that I have seen where they aren't. People wanting to use items dropped on the floor and touching stuff with their gloves and then making food. Some of these are accidental but it still happens. It seemed to happen a lot more at the first restaurant I worked at then the one I work at now. But to clear things up no we don't do anything on purpose to your food that I've seen because that's wrong and we have cameras all over the kitchen plus managers breathing down our neck 24/7. It may happen that I don't know about but not from what I've seen. There's not really a food you have to stay away from just make sure your food is right when you get it and cooked properly just in case. I would always check it before I ate it. The most nuggets in one order that I've seen is probably like 50 or 60 I think but we've had multiple orders in a row that added up to over a 100 total easily especially when we had a sale on them. As far as out fries they come in 4 sizes, baby fries, small, medium and large that's all that you can get. If large isn't enough you could always order multiple fries to satisfy your fry craving."

fastfood,3cyp03,U1457296,5,Thu Jul 16 08:07:46 2015 UTC,"Usually if someone wants a meal they'll say they want a ""#1"" compared to saying I want a Big Mac. But by you saying everything you want it saves time from me trying to go and figure out what you want. You can just start your order and keep talking and I can take your whole order without even saying a word until the end when I give you your total. This also saves time by you being ready with what you want and makes things move faster for both of us."
fastfood,3cyp03,stltoday2,4,Sun Jul 12 00:12:03 2015 UTC,Best to do it like this: large #1 with a coke.  It's best that you say the size first: we have to press that before we press what it actually is.
fastfood,3cyp03,jagenigma,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:22:21 2015 UTC,That's not how I do it. I press the sandwich button then the meal button in case they didn't want the meal I don't have to go back and change anything. I'm sure you can do it that way too but it's easier to do it this way for me. But yes saying it like that helps us out greatly when taking your order.

fastfood,3cyp03,heroesandnightmares,3,Mon Jul 13 00:39:04 2015 UTC,I am a pretty picky eater so I really only eat only two food items (I know I'm boring) but they are the nuggets or the Crispy Deluxe. I have had the McChicken too and that's not bad either. Other then that I'm not sure how the rest of the food tastes. Some items that hardly anybody orders are the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich and the Daily Double. Pretty much everything else is ordered on a daily basis. Everyone seems to like our new grilled chicken that we have so that could be considered underrated. We have a lot of popular items old and new that many customers like.

Also: the wrapping is not because the burger is messy, but because the Japanese hate to touch food with their hands.

It's a product designed to sell you marked up carbs with as little substance as possible. Deep frying that only makes the situation worse.  Buy a proper fast-food burger and deep fry that.

There was little incentive for merchants, card makers, or cardholders to use tap-and-pay over magstripe.  Notably, McDonalds and a few transit setups (chicago for example) held out, and actively encouraged the technology.   Google-wallet/ApplePay made a huge effort to revive NFC, but many merchants, even those who had working NFC setups, boycotted all NFC payments in general (turning off their readers or not installing them)."

Now I can just get Firehouse or Jimmy Johns which is a higher quality sub for around the same price. I just don't see a reason to go to Subway anymore since there's so many superior substitutes in the same price range. Haven't been in nearly two years now.
fastfood,38hgdq,JULIOOOOOO,-8,Thu Jun 4 13:25:01 2015 UTC,"You need to check the prices again. For a whole sub, Firehouse is $8 and Jimmy Johns is $6-7. Both places have smaller portion sizes than Subway, so I don't see how you can say they are similarly priced."

I'll gladly pay the extra $1-2 for a better tasting and more filling sandwich.  Although Subways meatball is like $3 cheaper so I could see an argument. Besides that I'm not sure there's a single sub that wouldn't be worth going to Firehouse and paying an extra $1-2 for.  Also I've never gotten larger servings at Subway. Firehouse stacks the meats while Subway always skimps."

While there are two Subways within 5 minutes of me, in different directions.  A big sandwich for $8 (I prefer the Club most of the time) is a good deal, compared to the $12-$15 I could expect to spend for a sit-down lunch at most of the casual restaurants around here even when they offer a special deal. And I can be in and out of the store in 5 minutes or less, instead of waiting half an hour for service at Chili's. (And I won't even go to McDonald's anymore.)"

In addition to this, many subs I used to see a couple years ago for $5 are more like $7+  For that price the fast-casual places will take Subway and their microwaved meat to the cleaners."

I can literally see through a slice of turkey now. A giant plastic roll, some factory veggies and 2.5 ounces of meat isn't what I want for lunch.  The other problem is that they're expensive.  A sub with chips and a drink will cost nearly $10. For the same $10 I can go to an actual restaurant and have an actual meal.  At their current price, they need to be awesome. And they aren't."

I never buy the combo, BTW. Since Subway doesn't sell beer, I just buy the sandwich at the place four blocks from me and take it home.  At the restaurants, I also have to sit there to eat (the take-out thing isn't worth it just for lunch), surrounded by mothers and small children. And I have to tip the waiter."
fastfood,38hgdq,ChiefsFan435,5,Fri Jun 5 00:32:38 2015 UTC,"My issue with them is for the same price I can go to Publix(local grocery chain in Florida) and can get a Boars Head sub with fresh cut deli meat and fresh veggies on amazing bread with a side (chips, potato salad, coleslaw, etc) and a drink.   Subway you get this pathetic sandwich with horrible tasting deli meat, terrible looking and tasting veggies on very basic bread."

fastfood,38hgdq,kattahn,2,Thu Jun 4 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting, to each their own, I guess. I found it to be quite tasty and the dressing to be a refreshing change from standard mayo/ranch. It is expensive though, but I only ever get it by itself, as getting it with fries kind of defeats the purpose"
fastfood,38hgdq,djcahill,2,Thu Jun 4 19:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now that there isn't much price difference between fast food restaurants, as their prices increase, and fast casual restaurants, there is less reason not to opt for the higher quality of the fast casuals."
fastfood,38hgdq,mattbin,6,Sat Jun 6 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"In about 1990, when subway first opened in my town, they were a breath of fresh (ha) air. They baked the buns in house, and they had an astounding array of toppings. The major sandwich chain in my part of Canada, Mr Sub, had three toppings, lettuce, tomato, onion, and one dressing.   In comes Subway with its rainbow of toppings and v-cut buns and meats other than ham and salami. We used to walk for 20 minutes from my high school to pick up subs at lunch.   In about 10 years they'd tried everything else, flatbreads, different hot meats, different toppings. And after a while you start to notice how everything has the same chemical taste. I am still getting the same toppings I did when they opened, too.   Meanwhile Mr Sub has upped its game considerably. They're just another crappy sandwich chain, but they have as many or more toppings, their buns aren't baked in store but they're still fresh, and things taste just a bit closer to what you have at home or in a little Polish deli or whatever.   I almost never go to Subway and when I do I regret it by the second bite. They feel like the same place as they were 25 years ago, and I'm not a stupid high school kid now.   I can see a contraction in their future,and that will not be pretty for anyone involved."
fastfood,38hgdq,kidhumbeats,8,Thu Jun 4 12:47:05 2015 UTC,And high school kids are not stupid high school kids now either. They are more homogenous too. Once it becomes uncool to eat shitty food the trend spreads like wildfire.   I really think eating Subway and McDonalds has become kind of taboo amongst young people lately.

As a teenager I didn't have such ready access to nutritional information - I could get it, sure, but how hard did I have to work for it? Now I can look up nutritional information for what I'm in line to order while I'm in line, waiting to order it.  I do see plenty of high school kids now flocking to places I wouldn't touch, but I'll bet it's not as good for those places as it once was."

Chipotle also has some healthier options(i usually get a burrito bowl, with just meat, rice, and salsa, which clocks in around 465 calories), but their standard fair is all pretty high up in the calorie count"

So I've never eaten there. Parking costs more downtown than lunch does. There are a lot of good eating places around here, including some excellent Chinese and Mexican and seafood, but many of the chains everyone on this sub raves about are simply too geographically limited. A number of them have no locations at all in my state, or even the neighboring states. If you don't live in California or Florida or New York, you're frequently out of luck. Subway is available everywhere -- which is the whole point."

They need to stop trying to be granola and start embracing the reality. (Drop the wraps and healthy crap. Come on.) They've been so beaten by the media into mediocrity that they need to just give everyone the finger and start making good food again. yes, it's unhealthy. Don't live on it.

With this being said, your food now is bland. your cheese taste like plastic, your burgers have no taste what so ever, your fries are usually cold and I am pretty surprised if my order is not messed up. My young kids will not even eat your food which says something as I have seen one of them eat dirt on more than 1 occasion.   your branding used to be characters like the Ham Burgler, Grimace, that bird woman and Ronald. you used to have employees that where proud to work at mcdonalds. They used to say that if you could work at mcdonalds you where going somewhere.   But in your efforts to cut cost at the expense of food quality and employees you are hitting bottom. your brand is synonymous with cheap shit and unfortunately that may be ok on the corporate side but on the consumer side I will rarely if ever eat at your establishment again. it is just gross."

I remember getting excited for the mcdonalds toys that wasn't branded from another company like batman or hello kitty. I remember that whenever i got sick and couldnt go to school or had to be picked up early i wouldnt be as sad since i would get their kids meal for lunch. And i dont think im that old. I think haha"

fastfood,37ll8b,djcahill,5,Fri May 29 03:09:52 2015 UTC,McDs is fucking up because they want to play fast casual when their business isn't optimized to compete in that field. Fast casual tastes better but can't compete pricewise. So give people cheap options that are appealing. Make the dollar menu killer and make premium menu items still cheaper than elsewhere. Why would I spend the kind of money I can spend anywhere at McDs? D

According to Bloomberg, the company plans to stop reporting monthly same-store sales after June, when its second-quarter earnings are released.  ""To focus our activities and conversations around the strategic, longer-term actions we are taking as part of our plan, we have decided to discontinue our monthly sales disclosure, effective July 1,"" Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's chief executive, said at an analysts conference in New York City on Wednesday.

Stop trying.  They should focus on their core menu, their popular items, focus on delivering them faster, hotter, better, and at a good price point. Offer healthy items that make sense, and offer better deals on smaller portioned items. Focus on increasing quality by not just making new expensive menu items, but improving their buns, improving their cheese, etc.  They need to look into automation, as one of the major complaints about these types of fast food restaurants is bad service and incorrect order handling."

I wish they would bring back mighty wings (but at the lower price when they were trying to get rid of them) and make the McRib a permanent menu item. The salads take too long to make and only account for 3% of their sales so they should probably go to. The premium McWraps are ok so I am on the fence about those.

For wood burning ovens that get to 800-900 degrees you can cook a pizza in 90 seconds. It doesnt surprise me at all that a partially cooked pizza can be cooked the rest of the way in 2 minutes in an oven. The time would not impressive for any restaurant, but it certainly makes it easy to pick one up and go. I will give them points on that.  *I do it at 550 to preheat my stone and then when I slide my pizza in I turn on the broiler. Cooks from both directions then, just like this oven at the 7-11."

My personal favorite item is the chili, which is, again, a bit more meaty flavored than most.  You know though... I do think part of the appeal of the food is the nostalgia effect, so I don't know if it would actually live up to the hype.  Also, just a thing to note is that they have table service inside, except the for signature restaurants...   Frankly though, if you go to a signature restaurant I am forced to hate you.

I remember a Big Mac being delicious when I was younger, but whenever I get one now, it's like a soggy piece of blech.  Taco Bell has the race to the bottom figured out.  Their dollar menu consists of things that are inherently inexpensive: beans and rice.  If McDonald's wants to have a $1 McDouble, they can't switch to using beans and rice, they have to try and get the cost of a meat patty down to that price point, and that's at the expense of food quality.  Burger King is really not that much better overall, but for 69 cents more than a McDouble, I get a double cheeseburger that is leaps and bounds better tasting than a McDouble."

There was a time when you could at the very least tout the fact that McDonald's was consistent.  A double cheeseburger was the same slop in Iowa as it was in Maine.  These days, it seems they have really come up short in the quality control dept.  For every 10 visits, you might get 2 or 3 meals that taste at least remotely fresh or like they didn't sit in the heat drawer for an hour.

The fries, gotta get them Cajun style, they rock.   Also I hate that every order is served as a to go, even if you dine in. It's a massive waste of paper and, yes, there are ways to serve all those fries to someone who is dining in using a reusable tray of some kind. Five Guys just says no to that and the environment."
fastfood,32urlw,Pfeffersack,2,Fri Apr 17 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"if they served it to eat in they'd have to have plates/forks/knives/spoons that would need to be policed and washed. That's as harmful and wasteful as a paper bag, a cup and a foil wrapper. Not saying I don't understand what you're saying but the alternative is also wasteful."
fastfood,32urlw,mrhoopers,4,Fri Apr 17 09:58:47 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I'd like to see the actual environmental difference. Over the years, I've written many people who engage in such studies (like people who write articles for Slate or whatever, not full on scientific studies), and nobody will even explore what is more harmful to the environment.  I even wrote Five Guys and got an answer back that basically said that they serve it like that for a couple of reasons, one being tradition that dates back to when they had no dine-in area, and the other being speed and efficiency.  Didn't address the environmental issue at all, which I find bothersome.  I agree the answer isn't simple, but let's see if paper for dine-in v. reusable trays is more environmental.  You'd think someone would be willing to do the analysis.  Here in Texas, we have a Five Guys ripoff chain called Mooyah Burgers.  They used to emulate Five Guys in many ways, including serving all orders as to go and all the dumping of fries.  In 2013 they changed some of their policies, including dine-in.  They use metal trays that look kinda like a bowl to hold all those fries (and, of course, put down wax paper between the food and tray) and that works for them just fine."

Back in the day, Five Guys got a lot of awards and notice for it's affordability. They've definitely come a long way from that as they are charging customers for essentially a ""Premium Burger"" instead of what they used to pride themselves on: ""cheap good eats""."

You should try Habit burger. Its good. on par with in n out/ carls $6 burger but a bit different. famous for charring their burgers so you get a nice smokey taste and a bit of crunch."

I go for grilled onions, mushrooms and jalapeño peppers Mayo   S&P can help as well but I don't usually need it.  Cajun fries are a requirement.    There's a pizza place nearby that sells personal pizzas for $7.99. They're slightly more filling than 5 guys. Chipotle is in the same vein (A burrito is, what, $6 now?) so they're all targeting a similar market.   Food prices at restaurants have gone stupid.  Wife and I went to Capital Grille (4 star; 4 $ restaurant.) We had drinks, salads, 2 sides (brussels sprouts and au gratin potatoes) and steaks. No dessert. $295 with tip.    You can cut $50 or more off from drinks (that were weak).    It was good. It wasn't great. It wasn't $295 great. it was $145 - 195 great. If you take out the drinks it was about $50 - $100 overpriced.    We won't be going back. I can make the same meal for $50 or less depending on the cost of steak and it'll be as good if not better.     That said I'll get 5 Guys all day long. Dat cheese. Dem onions. Doz fries!"

fastfood,32rlih,chef_boyceardee,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:54:24 2015 UTC,Lol. I'm just a graduate student with nothing to do these days. Was at  my local KFC this weekend when my friend who works there told me about this issue. Thought I could give them some feedback :)
fastfood,32rlih,chef_boyceardee,10,Thu Apr 16 05:28:32 2015 UTC,"Most people at my age are on the go. If I eat KFC most likely Im getting chicken little's because they are cheap and quick. KFC needs more cheap and quick to go along with their buckets that families buy. Like the Twister wrap was great. Also up your sides. Only viable sides for CL's or 5 buck bowls are potato wedges and maybe coleslaw. They need more options ""wedges with cheese"" or a side salad maybe."
fastfood,32rlih,psmwrxguy,3,Thu Apr 16 04:15:24 2015 UTC,What you are saying makes a lot of sense. I completely agree that they need to up their quick sell items to increase their supply/demand
fastfood,32rlih,benzimo,4,Thu Apr 16 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. They will always have their families that order large buckets or 3 piece meals, but to get the young crowd you need a twist to make it quick or taste a little more fun."
fastfood,32rlih,Not_An_Ambulance,10,Thu Apr 16 14:43:16 2015 UTC,"Bring. Back. The. Twister.   Also, website is absolute shit! They show you the foods they have but not your combo/meal options. It's just a list of raw ingredients. It's the worst of all the major chains. Taco Bell is second worst."
fastfood,32rlih,FCDallasBurn,11,Thu Apr 16 10:38:03 2015 UTC,"they had snackers which were good 1$ items, first they removed the cheese ones then they removed the normal ones, then they replaced them with some awful mayo and pickle chicken sandwich thing. now i don't even go there since the franchisee in my area shut down all his stores.  do they even have a value menu?"
fastfood,32rlih,doyouboo1,8,Thu Apr 16 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"KEEP THE DOUBLE DOWN. I know it's probably shaving off a few extra years of my life each time I order one, but it's so worth it. Don't do this McRib ""for a limited time"" bullshit."

fastfood,32rlih,jagenigma,7,Mon Apr 20 17:30:33 2015 UTC,KFC seems more like what a family would get instead of students. They need more options at cheaper prices
fastfood,32rlih,HydroThorium,0,Thu Apr 16 05:22:19 2015 UTC,I agree. They might have to deter from their Traditional Family fast food joint and cater other things on their menu to solve this issue
fastfood,32rlih,NakedNude17,5,Thu Apr 16 05:29:34 2015 UTC,"Because the food is generally more expensive than other fast food places. I mean, the chicken little is like $1.39? it's the size of a finger.   Wanna appeal to college kids? they gotta make a decent sized cheap option."
fastfood,32rlih,TheBlackSpank,9,Thu Apr 16 07:13:36 2015 UTC,"Hi KFC. I wanna like you, but you got some QC issues. Also your restaurants are usually dirty as fuck. You're like a virus - you even fuck up your Taco Bell hybrids. Most standalone Taco Bells I go to are pretty clean. The KFC/Taco doublets are pretty grody.  Popeyes isn't anything amazing, but at least its quality is pretty consistent."

fastfood,32rlih,Not_An_Ambulance,3,Thu Apr 16 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"I live in KFC Central (Louisville) and the KFCs that I do frequent every now and then are typically dirty in the dining room - which makes me wonder what the kitchen is like.  I'd probably go more often if they cleaned it up a little and offered some spicy options, since they did away with Buffalo sauce."
fastfood,32rlih,jagenigma,4,Thu Apr 16 09:00:29 2015 UTC,"This is the problem with KFC - unlike say McDonald's, is they only do one thing which is chicken - and it's not that great. Also, in Australia anyway, the service is shiiiiiiiiiit."
fastfood,32rlih,Not_An_Ambulance,5,Thu Apr 16 10:02:27 2015 UTC,"Grabbing a burger and fries or a couple tacos is just quicker and easier. Simple as that. A college student doesn't want buckets of stuff.  You could have more sandwiches, but there are plenty of chains that already have that market dominated, so I doubt anyone would really care. Frankly, I don't think there's anything KFC could do to improve on that demographic other than kill their prices to just make it the most affordable fast food."
fastfood,32rlih,televixen,5,Thu Apr 16 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"More Chicken Sandwich varieties Chicken-Bacon-Ranch, Chipotle-Chicken, etc.  I make a sub style sandwich with the boneless pieces with cornslaw (Cornbread and a lg side of coleslaw mix) and a slice of white american cheese"
fastfood,32rlih,Radbutt,3,Sun Apr 19 21:35:37 2015 UTC,They do have the $5 meal options.  That should already be appealing to their budgets for going out to get fast food
fastfood,32rlih,Vladdy1,4,Thu Apr 16 05:51:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the main reason I don't get those is that I don't like their packaging... I don't need a plate sitting in my passenger seat as i try to eat in my car when I could be eating out of a bag or box instead... Plus, the chicken seems sort of bland to me."

""Hi, one five piece tenders meal, spicy with Cajun fries please ... HONEY MUSTARD PLEASE.""   You sit down, you pour a shot of dark rum a little too quickly because you are so hungry. You press play on the prerecorded ESPN show. You open that orange box of deliciousness. You spy that sauce packet and peel it back carefully and gracefully.   The moment of truth. You throw back that shot of rum. It glides down your throat chased by the cold coke you draw through your lips by sucking on the straw. The alcohol isn't in your system yet, but already your brain chemistry has realigned. Just knowing you have one down puts you in relaxed, feast mode. It's been a long day.   You grab the nicest tender of the five (six really since one was broken up ... they didn't skimp) ... and you dip it elegantly ... not too much, just the right amount of sauce on there. It passes your lips and you bite off a piece with a loud crunch. These are definitely extra crispy.   First it's just warm and crunchy. Then that sauce hits you. That perfect thick zesty sauce. And boom! A little spice comes off with the breading. Heavenly. But you miss the sauce already. You grab three perfectly seasoned cajon fries which are always soft instead of crunchy but for some reason you prefer it that way. You dip the three fries at once right into the honey mustard and then wrap your lips around the sauce that's wrapped around the fries and you let it fill your mouth. Perfect chaser for that spicy tender. Finally more of that heavenly sauce.   You allow yourself to come down for a second. Kornheiser and Wilbon are discussing possible upsets in the upcoming sweet 16 NCAA tournament. You are happy. For a moment you are sated. Maybe something a little less savory? You take a small bite of that dry flaky biscuit that you smothered with honey. Delicious. But sweet! You need something spicy, savory and zesty to balance it out.   You hastily pour another shot and begin again.   Oh Honey Mustard, Honey Mustard. Wherefore art thou Honey Mustard?! To die, to sleep. To sleep perchance to dream. Aye there's the rub. For in this sleep of death what dreams may come ... without honey mustard ... shuffle off this mortal coil.   Edit: proof-reading  Edit 2: gilded? In this tiny sub? I thank you immensely!"

They understand people in a rush don't like waiting and alot of business is people in a rush for mcdonalds. I was in a mcdonalds the other day their was one employee manning the register for the inside and once that employee took someone's order she turned around and made the food. I waited for 10 minutes to even get my order taken. They're was no cars in the drive thru when I pulled up. I just had one of those days of me wanting to sit down and eat.

fastfood,30623c,DisgruntledGoat0604,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"It seems in today's fast food industry that drive-thru efficiency is one of the most prized metrics.  I'm not sure why drive-thru seems to get priority over inside patrons, but I have a few theories...   At most restaurants, there are as many as 3 different transactions actively being attended to in a single drive-thru line: one car taking order, one car paying for order, one car receiving food.  Pretty much all modern fast food restaurants have computer systems keeping track of how long it takes for an order to go from start to finish, and employees are taught to focus on getting these times down as low as possible.  Tons of research has gone into making the process extremely efficient, and nowadays restaurant locations are designed around making the drive-thru as fast a process as possible.  This is different from the in-store process, where generally a single cashier will take and fill one customer's order before moving on to the next one.  In other words, not only is the drive-thru designed to be a more streamlined process, but employees are encouraged to move it along as fast as possible on top of that. When there is a long line of cars in the drive-thru, it ""looks bad""...potential customers who don't have time to sit and wait in line are more likely to just keep on driving if they notice a long line.  Long lines of patrons inside the restaurant, however, is something that often can't be observed just by passing by, and thus not noticed by the customer until they've already committed to stopping at and entering the restaurant. In many restaurants, if it becomes crowed and lines start forming inside, multiple registers can be opened so customers can form into more than one line to help speed things up a bit, however with the drive through it's usually one a single line, and thus more important to keep it moving at a steady pace. Customers who enter the restaurant are often perceived to be in less of a hurry, as they either plan to dine in or have taken the time to park their vehicles and enter restaurant.    I've never worked in fast food, but I'm willing to bet that new hires are generally trained to take orders in-restaurant before they are moved to drive-thru lines.  EDIT:  tl/dr:  Chances are, even if the line a few cars deep, at many restaurants it will still be faster to wait for drive-through service"

As far as chains go, I think they have the best hot dog pretzel bun.  Sonic's Pretzel buns, for example, are really terrible for compared to this one.  I grew up on Wienerschnitzel as I grew up in CA and for the longest time, it was the closest fast food place to me and I walked/biked there a lot as a kid.  I've seen the menu evolve over time.  The one thing I miss is the simple hamburger/cheeseburger (and even bacon cheeseburger) with lettuce and tomato.  They used the perfect amount of mustard and ketchup on those burgers, and put them on top of each other on the bun to mix them up, which got me into mixing mustard and ketchup.  Not to mention it had a huge lettuce leaf and great tomato too.  Too bad nowadays the only burgers there seem to be ones with chili, incl the junkyard burger (Which I like, but doesn't compare to the regular burger of yesteryear).  One them I admire about the chain is that they never changed the fries.  Never got into the fad of thicker fries or natural cut fries.  Still plain ole shoestring fries.

There was one below the Arch in St. Louis.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-riverboat-st-louis  I ate there back in '84 or '85.  Same old McDonald's fare but the ambiance aboard a converted riverboat was different.  I believe the company closed it down sometime during the first decade of this century.

All you have to do is look at the ingredients in on your typical cereal box. And if you need to eat on the go, a convenience store will always have some fast food available.

There are a lot of small markets that tend to sell processed foods as opposed to fresh produce and meats. This is termed a ""food desert"". Here is a great TED talk from a guy that organizes community gardens using existing space throughout inner city type areas. It is a major problem when your only food access is unhealthy, and raising kids on it lowers the chance of them developing a taste for fresh food, which means generation after generation is living on pre-packaged meals. That is what causes the problem just as much as fast food, if not more so. At least fast food does have a little bit of vegetables available on some food. With prepackaged stuff, there isn't anything fresh."

You'd think that everyone else in this thread being snarky at you would consider the similarities this has to the people that were being insulted by Comcast's customer service reps and immediately start drawing parallels."
fastfood,2zaf1w,benzimo,7,Sun May 10 08:41:24 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's a little different than that. In the case of comcast the rep was being directly rude to the customer verbally. My guess is that in thise case the ticket was not supposed to end up at the table.  With that in mind it was likely an inside joke that the customer was never supposed to hear.  Anyone who has ever worked in a service industry can tell you that the customers are inevitably going to be made fun of or poked at behind the scenes.  It should never ever reach the customer but accidents happen.  The person should probably be reprimanded but if they aren't, it's not the end of the world.  I don't think a witch hunt to corporate about it is necessary.  I don't know why we feel the need to punish people for such mundane infractions these days.

And yeah, I worked at a fast food place growing up, and we would say similar things about bad customers. But this would be much after the fact (during breaks and not during work hours). And if we had slipped up and written it down on orders, and customers found out, that would be bad not just for us but for our company as a whole.  I'm absolutely not suggesting that we start a witchhhunt at all. Yes, ultimately, it is a small fuckup, and the person responsible for it shouldn't lose their job over it and the company shouldn't face a PR nightmare. But at the same time, it is completely unacceptable behavior for a customer to experience. That's why most joints provide ""How was our service"" surveys and hotlines if you do have complaints, so that customers don't feel that it's necessary to blow things over. That's what I'm suggesting OP do, not spread this around like the Comcast bills. That was more of a take on how a lot of people in this thread are calling OP's mom a 'rude bitch' and all that instead of being supportive."

Carl's Jr/Hardees has the best burger patty out of all the fast food joints I've tried. They are thick and smokey and taste amazing. Also their burgers are pretty unique compared to other spots. I'm sure they aren't completely original, but it was the first time I saw it which makes me think of them as innovators.  Western Bacons and the Breakfast Burger are the WAY TO GO. I actually just got off a 20 hour plane trip to Thailand and before I left, I made sure to get a breakfast burger as that will fill you up for the day. But if anything, get something from there and you'll enjoy it.  The only caveat is their prices are a little bit higher than average. You'll end up paying $6 for a burger, but considering its size and the menu selection, it's worth it to me."

fastfood,2yiram,UltimateNegrodamus,8,Tue Mar 10 08:06:54 2015 UTC,"It's usually up, but if a manager cleans it incorrectly then it messes the machine up for a while. Mine has gone down a bunch though."

It was after midnight, and we literally visited 5 McD's in the downtown area only to be disappointed at each. We finally asked the last location we visited WTF was going on with the lack of soft-serve ice cream. We learned that the soft serve machine shuts down automatically each evening around 10PM IIRC for maintenance, which is why it's impossible to get soft-serve ice cream from McD's at night."

fastfood,2ybhw5,pappy97,6,Sun Mar 8 07:16:02 2015 UTC,"IMHO, McDonald's has lost their focus. They've bent over backwards trying to follow trends and lost some quality in their core products. I'd like to see the following:   Slim down the menu. Cut everything that has terrible sales. Reduce the complexity and costs for cooking and prep. Bring back beef tallow and the original fries! Ditch the cooked ""meat warmers"" where patties sit for a while until later assembled and return to cooking fresh from the grill to the wrapped product.   Bring back the quality, flavor, and menu focus they had many years ago. There's a whole generation out there that's never tasted their legendary beef tallow fries. A lot of customers would 'come back' to McDonald's for their best and they'd earn new ones who don't even know what they're missing today."

So the person working the window tells him that they don't sell cheeseburgers and their menu is right there to order from.

It's an outsourced ordering person, and I actually work here.    So, I pull forward and find out that to keep staff low, they were outsourcing the drive thru ordering and the order is put through the computer up on the screen.

One night I get a call from Jack in the Box (immediately after the ecoli incident) wanting to do a trade. My food costs were really good, so I ask what they want, and tell them I had 4 on staff and whatever they thought would be a fair trade for two large pepperoni pizzas. My driver returns with a case of cheescake, a case of frozen mozz sticks, and three bags loaded with bacon ultimate cheeseburgers and fries. We probably got well over $100 in food at cost. We wound up taking all of the frozen stuff to the bar that night and did trades for free drinks. The bartender wound up cooking about 5 pounds of mozz sticks just for everyone to snack on that night.  The following day a JitB manager calls and asks if we had made a trade. I told him we had, but that I hadn't specified what we wanted and that is what we got. He begged me that if I ever traded with his night crew again to tell them what we wanted as they had no idea about food cost. I took him out for a few drinks that weekend to make up for it."

Food would arrive cold, drinks with melted ice, orders could be wrong (as there is a few miscommunications that could occur- if the order is passed between 3/4 people, each step increases the likelihood of a mistake).  They would also be competing directly with established food delivery companies in each service area that already offer this service - although most people would never consider getting their fast food delivered."
fastfood,2xn2tx,stiggz,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"There's a Chinese food delivery service in my area called ""Wok to You"" where they will deliver Chinese food from any of 31 restaurants in the area.  There's a couple caveats, though.  You can only choose from these 31 restaurants, and the particular restaurant you want to order from must be within two miles from where it's to be delivered.  They've somewhat mitigated the logistics problem by specifically working with each of these particular Chinese food restaurants, they ensure a driver is within reach of each restaurant, and because the delivery location is only up to two miles away, the food stays hot and deliverable.  For this Fast2Go concept, it kind of sounds like the plan is to just have some guy go through the drive-thru, buy your food, and bring it to you with no guarantees.  The concept used by ""Wok to You"" would more than likely not work for the fast food restaurants.  I doubt my local McDonald's would be willing to set up some kind of deal with a delivery service as it would take too much extra time to implement with little added benefit to them."

Most people are fans of Huy Fong Sriracha, but they are far from being the only sriracha manufacturer out there. They have a unique taste. David Tran, the guy that started Huy Fong developed his sauce in California using local ingredients. A lot of the sauces you get are from other parts of the world, and the ingredients can taste different because of the soil/sun/environment, as well as ratios of ingredients, as well as using different ingredients all together. It can also change the flavor by how it is processed. Huy Fong ferments their main ingredients for a long time before finishing the sauce, but others use fresh ingredients with no fermentation and this can vastly change how the finished product tastes."

Fun fact: many, many years ago in my youth I worked at a McDs.  The big mac sauce came in big cylinders that went into something that looked like a caulking gun, with a very similar mechanism.  You ripped off a bit of tin foil on the front, then pulled the trigger for one squirt of the sauce.  If I really thought hard I bet I could come up with the exact method for getting the buns ready.  But I really don't want to.  Also, the sauces for the McChicken and Filet-O-Fish were done the same way.  No idea how they are done now."

Chipotle food is still decent quality, but does pack a lot of sodium and saturated fats.   People should know going in there that a burrito will probably be around 1000 calories, with all the cheese, red meat, rice, and tortilla, all things that can be very filling.    The thing about Chipotle is that you get real ingredients.  Most of your calories aren't ""shitfoods"" like other fast food joints.  There aren't many empty calories here.  That's why it's 'better for you'.   It's still not healthy, especially if the rest of your days meals are loaded with sodium."

fastfood,2vwnip,GoSomaliPirates,9,Sat Feb 14 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"There's no way Chipotle would ever do that. It would destroy their brand.  I'm assuming that the smaller size will be taking away seating areas and some cooking space, but they will always cut and cook everything in house."

While any meal with low preparation time can be considered fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant or store with preheated or precooked ingredients, and served to the customer in a packaged form for take-out/take-away. Fast food restaurants are traditionally separated by their ability to serve food via a drive-through. The term ""fast food"" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.    Image i - A typical fast food meal in the United States includes a hamburger, french fries, and a soft drink.

But there are reasons it isn't perfect:   I like Cane's sauce, but it isn't as great as overhyped by diehard fans.  I was expect much, much better than the simple mayo based sauce that it acually is.  I'd also much rather they offer a selection of sauces than one.  And the why the fuck do you have to pay extra for more sauce? Come on.  Even for box combo, one extra sauce, upon request, should be complimentary. It's pretty pricey.  What you show, IMHO, is not that much food (And if you eat it to go, medium tea isn't a lot of tea IMHO).  I end up usually ordering an extra order of fries.  Sandwich combo is really bad, you barely get any fries and you have to order extra fries to get enough fries.  Want a gallon jug of sweet tea? $5(!).  Lemonade? $8(!!!).  Insane. The coleslaw is a joke.  It's not bad, but that tiny container has 2-3 bites and it's gone.  You should be getting more slaw for your money.    I always hear about people not liking crinkle cut fries and the sesame toast being ""weird"".   I like both of these, so no complaints here."

Probably their saving grace really, but I agree that they should have some kind of bbq sauce (like chic fil a's honey roasted bbq would be amazing with cane's tendies) or something else to offer.  The price isn't too bad I find. Most places average about ten bucks a person where I live so being able to get a decent meal for under that with a drink (free refills if you're eating there) is okay in my book.  The coleslaw is probably my favorite coleslaw of any fast food place but they really do skimp on it. You might have a larger bite than me because it takes me several to eat the little cup.

fastfood,2vbw2j,emkay99,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"Not too sure actually. It just came to our restaurant in white packages that just said ""chicken marinade"". It seemed like a salt mixture of some kind though."
fastfood,2vbw2j,Pikafreaks,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:51:17 2015 UTC,"And I'm in south Louisiana, and the various Cane's locations around here are always busy at lunchtime. Popeye's used to be really, really good -- but, as so often happens when a local chain sells out to a corporation, they went a long ways downhill very quickly. Still much better than KFC, but not at all like it used to be. There's also a problem with cleanliness the last couple of years. All the Popeye's I've seen are really grubby. Like they haven't mopped the place in months. And since it's not just at one store, I figure someone rewrote the manual and gave clean-up very low priority."

fastfood,2vbw2j,thegumpguy,6,Tue Feb 10 12:06:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to bite and explain the hate...  Raising Cane's recipe for chicken & sauce is stolen from a restaurant chain based out of Alabama named Guthrie's. Guthrie's also sells other food besides the chicken, and is small and not rapidly expanding.  In addition to Raising Cane's, another restaurant chain named Zaxby's   also stole the same recipe from Guthrie's... But, frankly I think Zaxby's is better.  So, it's not about the food... it's the fact that this particular chain has clearly stolen their recipe for their only food item from another chain, and they were literally the 2nd place to even do it... it's really really lame."
fastfood,2vbw2j,costanza_vandelay,3,Tue Feb 10 03:22:33 2015 UTC,I like the sauce and toast at Cane's better than Zaxbys.

fastfood,2vbw2j,PyroSpark,2,Tue Feb 10 18:47:10 2015 UTC,I tried Cane's back in Baton Rouge with my uncle when I was about 12 or 13 (so 12 to 13 years ago) and again when it first came to Texas in Dallas then once more again here in Houston when they opened the very 1st few. I can tell the hate comes from those who think it is just another chicken place or don't know what makes it special. I hear hate about the portions as well. To me when a restaurant expands out they have to cut corners one way or another. With Cane's it seems like that it is their portion size. Just my two cents. Love the sauce though and love it more that I can buy a whole cup of it.

fastfood,2v596h,patinthehat2,7,Sun Feb 8 02:12:52 2015 UTC,"That's a concept I can't quite grasp either, but I assume that growing up/living in a large city offers many other options.  I grew up in the Midwest, and McDonalds are everywhere.  I like the fact that he didn't completely trash everything, and actually had some decent ideas for improvement.  One thing I agree with is that McDonalds has too many menu items, and that they would be better off cutting back on some."
fastfood,2v596h,Johnzsmith,3,Sun Feb 8 06:06:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm not as much a fan of the McDonald's fries, but they are pretty good. But McDonald's coffee is usually quite good anywhere you go.  Of course anyone will tell you they only go to McDonald's for the breakfast …  It's basically wise, but sort of cruel and we're trying to troubleshoot the restaurant anyway."
fastfood,2v596h,Pixel_Knight,5,Sun Feb 8 07:30:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you too. It is hard to believe he never had.  I'm in my early 30's and even if I had immense success right now, my parents took me to get Happy Meals when I was like 10 years old in the early 1990's.  I believe I remember even going to a McDonald's birthday party when I lived in a different state where I must have been less than 6 years old, and I was unhappy with the way facepaint itched my face.  I usually think Zakarian is the most thoughtful and trustworthy of the Chopped judges, but that part did strike me as well."
fastfood,2v59fn,aje1212,5,Sun Feb 8 00:51:18 2015 UTC,"Can I still order a Big and Tasty?  Also, do they still keep cooked meats in those plastic trays?  What is the time limit on grilled chicken and how often do you just throw it out?"
fastfood,2v59fn,CapnJackson,5,Sun Feb 8 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"The Big N' Tasty, at least in the Southeast US, is not a menu item, and few employees will be of use if you try to ask for it by name.  However, if google serves me right, you can essentially re-create it by ordering a QP deluxe (new configuration) without mustard and cheese.   Yes, we use a holding tray/cabinet for all meats (and breakfast breads).   Grilled chicken has a maximum hold time of 60 minutes.  During lunch/dinner peak, that limit is rarely reached, but during snack and late night periods, a careless grill person can cook enough chicken in one/two batches to last hours.  At our store, if grilled chicken is still in the cabinet after 90-120 minutes, its wasted (despite incentives from management to not waste dozens of grilled chickens)."
fastfood,2v59fn,TehWildMan_,-2,Mon Feb 9 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"If you mean a Big Mac then yes because I don't know what a Big and Tasty is. And yes all food is kept in plastic trays. Some of them have liners in them, some have metal wire trays in them and others have neither. Grilled Chicken can be kept I want to say an hour but I'm not sure. But we usually don't throw it out unless it like real bad. My old store hardly did at all."
fastfood,2v59fn,FTZulu,7,Mon Feb 9 15:32:26 2015 UTC,If you mean a Big Mac then yes because I don't know what a Big and Tasty is.   You sweet sweet summer child.
fastfood,2v59fn,beaner505,3,Mon Feb 9 19:23:06 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that he didn't mean Big Mac unless he's an alien from another planet because asking if McDonald's still serves Big Macs is like asking if Pizza Hut still serves pizza.

fastfood,2v59fn,TalonLardner,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:45:46 2015 UTC,I'm not sure because I haven't seen anyone do that on my store yet. But from what I've heard there are times given in the beginning of the day and at that time you do it. And I think the times vary every day
fastfood,2v59fn,TehWildMan_,3,Mon Feb 9 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"How big of a difference does management have on morale? Do good managers have low employee turnover, our does it not matter much?"
fastfood,2v59fn,brownjl1,3,Sun Feb 8 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"The biggest factor in day-to-day morale is whether or not enough employees are present to handle the volume at any given time.  If there's a shortage of labor, breaks may be next to impossible to give out at desirable times (nobody likes their break 1 hour into a 12 hour shift).   The next challenge is keeping track of employee's capabilities and preferences when it comes to what duties they are responsible for. Some crew members do not like being moved around, while others refuse to work a entire shift at one station.  There are also some pairings of employees that should be avoided.  This is one of the most important duties of management with respect to the crew."
fastfood,2v59fn,enriquevv75,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"I don't really see a relationship between good managers and low employee turnover. You would think that because there are good managers that the employees would stay longer but that's not always the case. Employees may quit for their own reasons. I don't really see a difference. But the morale is better with good managers. Being an employee, you know that if you're working with a good manager that your day will be a little bit easier and maybe you'll have some fun. On the other hand, work with a bad manager and your day could be awful."

fastfood,2v59fn,TehWildMan_,2,Mon Feb 9 05:17:15 2015 UTC,The highest I've seen at my store is three patties for the triple onion cheddars we occasionally have ordered. I don't really know how high it goes though as no one has ordered anything bigger then that. I do know that you can't have more then one mcchicken per bun at mine though.
fastfood,2v59fn,blacksweat,2,Mon Feb 9 07:07:14 2015 UTC,I guess you could put as many as you want but it's an extra charge for each patty that you want to add on. Know also that we have to make able to make it and fit it in the wrapper and bag.
