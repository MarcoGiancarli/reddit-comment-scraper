You kind of get used to the rain and just go about your business mostly, but I did find it wearing on me a bit by the end. Very moderate temperature wise too... Might get cold enough to snow some in the middle of winter but not usually, and if it got into the 80s in the summer people were freaking out.  That's the coast though, the other side of the state and the mountains are completely different. Definitely on my list of places to revisit when I can though, pretty awesome."

unitedstatesofamerica,3cx4y8,Yellowfin1990,2,Sat Jul 11 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"Often regarded as the most beautiful arch in the world, Delicate Arch stands 65 feet (20m) above the steep sandstone formations below.  Delicate Arch is the most recognizable feature of Arches National Park and is an icon of the state of Utah. The Delicate Arch was formed from Entrada Sandstone which was gradually worn away by weathering and wind erosion over millions of years. Delicate Arch is accessible through a moderate 1.5 mile (2.4km) hike up steep slickrock and around narrow rock ledges. On the horizon lies the snow-capped La Sal Mountains which contrasts the deep colors of the surrounding Entrada Sandstone.   “A weird lovely fantastic object out of nature, like Delicate Arch, has the curious ability to remind us — like rock and sunlight and wind and wilderness — that out there is a different world, older and greater and deeper by far than ours” – Edward Abbey"

It's a pretty modestly sized complex compared to its eastern and southern neighbors. It doesn't really serve the military purpose the word 'fort' would suggest. It would have served as more of a central apartment style house for the regional political leaders. It's interesting mostly because of how far it's economic and cultural ties went. There's very clear cultural linkages between waputki and Mexican states far too the south. They traded extensively. with both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, as well as with the plains. If you look at where waputki is on a map in relation to any of these things, you can see that this is really quite an impressive set of linkages. It's still important today because we have oral histories that discuss the people who lived in it, although the Wikipedia page really doesn't discuss that properly because of how touchy the subject is."

My dad was once hunting in the mountains above Roslyn when the whole hillside was lit up like daylight. He ran into the production crew, and apparently they were filming a day time scene and were using a ton of huge bulbs to achieve the effect. The guys asked my dad if he could wait until later to hunt that area, and they were sorry, yadda yadda.  Anyway, my dad is pretty peeved, and knows all the deer in the area are probably long gone. So the crew takes him out to dinner that night in Roslyn and he gets to meet the cast and all that. Pretty cool experience.  Also, this town is the reason Four Lokos had caffeine removed. A bunch of underage drinkers got really sick drinking a lot of them here and it was blamed on the caffeine (they said it keeps people from being able to tell they are getting really drunk).

unitedstatesofamerica,3awdtx,kybishop,2,Wed Jun 24 01:09:59 2015 UTC,That looks like a superb trail to hike. How was your experience with it?
unitedstatesofamerica,3awdtx,Quouar,2,Wed Jun 24 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"26 miles long over a mix of sand, rocks, and grassy plateaus. You'll see (and hear!) seals, cross beautiful flowers, and watch raging waves smash against the sea cliffs. You'll run from the tide as you make it across narrow paths. You might get caught in the rain and sleep in the abandoned lighthouse (wink wink). You might even run across a beached whale.  All in all, if you're very fit, and like to hike ultralight, it will take you less than 48 hours. If you're casual, plan for 3 or 4 days. Water is abundant, and camp sites plentiful.  In conclusion, nothing short of amazing!"

unitedstatesofamerica,3aukyg,ThePolemicist,6,Tue Jun 23 17:06:16 2015 UTC,"Elk Horn has the largest concentration of Danish immigrants/descendants in the US. Back in the 70s, the people of Elk Horn decided to purchase an authentic windmill from Denmark. Shortly thereafter, Denmark passed a law that prohibited the sale and exportation of their famous windmills. So, this one is only one of a handful in the US, and it is the only working, authentic Danish windmill in the country. You can pay a small fee (I think it was $3) to watch a history video of the windmill and then walk around inside the windmill. More history and info here."

Totally blind at 200 mph."
unitedstatesofamerica,3a8l3m,sevargmas,2,Thu Jun 18 05:18:01 2015 UTC,"yet you still can't see anything in front of you at all   Slightly false.  Without getting into technical detail, there is something called ""minimums"" that is explicitly stated on each airport instrument approach diagram.  The major metric to this is the ""decision height"", or aka ""altitude of no return"".    Say you're an aircraft approaching on an instrument plan.  Upon descending to the decision height, there are two possible scenarios:   You have visual sight of the runway (runway lights help a lot ;-) ).  ""Tower, AirNoobMadeInChinaChina, we have visual of runway 18L"".  ""AirNoodMadeInChina, Tower, cleared to land 18L"".  One thing to point out: in order to see the runway, that means you must have enough visibility to see through the air, however foggy or whatever precip there is.  So you're not entirely blind.  This could mean that the cloud base is higher than the minimums, in which case you ""break out of the soup"", a highly dramatic and beautiful experience for us pilots. You DON'T have visual sight of the runway.  ""Tower, AirNoobMadeInChina, executing missed approach"".  ""AirNoobMadeInChina, Tower, climb 3500 course 290 and intercept VOR"" (or etc.).  The law is, you can't land if you don't have visual sighting of the correct runway.  ATC will tell you to execute a missed approach (standard procedures, don't panic guys) for another attempt to land.  This may be due to weather (visibility extremely poor) or pilot error.  (But fortunately ATC has radar view of you so any pilot error can be corrected).  Ever hear the plane's engines suddenly rev up when you were expecting it to touch down?  Yeah thats a missed approach."
unitedstatesofamerica,3a8l3m,NoobMadeInChina,0,Thu Jun 18 23:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think that if most non-aviation savvy passengers knew how much pilots rely on information they can't necessarily varify in situations they don't really have the full picture of, a lot of them might think twice about hopping on a jet. ;)  The thing is, it's all very safe (99.99% of the time, at least), but what it really does come down to when flying by instrument rules is placing a lot of trust in things that are out of the pilots' control (i.e. that the instruments are functioning properly, that the air traffic controllers didn't make an error, and that all of the other pilots out there are following their rules and instructions to a tee)."
unitedstatesofamerica,3a8l3m,The_Crass-Beagle_Act,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:25:02 2015 UTC,"I think that if most non-aviation savvy passengers knew how much pilots rely on information they can't necessarily varify in situations they don't really have the full picture of, a lot of them might think twice about hopping on a jet. ;)   That is why there are VERY stringent regulations on the type of equipment that the pilots can trust.  And not to mention the stringent schedule of having to inspect each individual instrument.       the air traffic controllers didn't make an error   Rarely happens.  There is no other comparison out there IMO...the reason why ATC has not yet been fully automated by computers today is because computers simply are not powerful enough to make those type of decisions.  Plus, I'll trust humans more than I'll ever trust an automated voice coming from a computer.  Same goes for airplanes...A lot of journalists say ""automated commercial flying"" or ""replacing pilots by computers"" is the next big thing, but in reality, it still boils down to the same question.  (Side note: autopilot is different, because the pilots supervise the autopilot).   all of the other pilots out there are following their rules and instructions to a tee   Yes, pilot error, whether intentional or unintentional, happens.  In aviation, arrogance or ignorance is the biggest killer.  Pilots who go out there and think they own the sky either 1) gets hammered by the FAA, or 2) die."

In the late 80s and early 90s, there were also a series of incidents where car doors were opened on the wrong side. The boards have been around since the 70s in various forms, but the conductors have been pointing at them since the 90s. The horrific 1991 Union Square wreck, which killed five people and injured hundreds of others, certainly raised awareness about security in the system. Sometimes supervisors will remove the board to see what the conductor will do. They are supposed to to contact the train operator and radio in that the board is missing, otherwise they can be written up. Consider that the next time your train is delayed!  My favorite conductor was on the 1 train a few years ago. He was an older fellow with a very calming voice. Sometimes I would chat with him at 242nd Street before he started his shift. The day that he retired, as he was announcing the stops, he was talking about what a pleasure it was for him to have worked as a conductor and how he met so many great people. I made sure to thank him profusely for his work, as people often think it's okay to bully conductors (I've seen people throw things at them, scream at the top of their lungs towards them, spit on them and once I saw a drunk dude full-on deck a conductor). It was wonderful to hear how much he truly enjoyed his job, and it made me appreciate all of the people who do their job to keep the system running (which is really fucking amazing when you think about it). Anyway, thanks for sharing the video! I really enjoy seeing the conductors smile and laugh. I put the cool flair on it."

unitedstatesofamerica,398q8n,CholentPot,2,Wed Jun 10 01:49:25 2015 UTC,So I take it this is Niagra Falls today taken from a camera that is 120 years old?  That's pretty cool how perfectly it replicates an old-timey vibe. I guess it goes to show how much our idea of how that time period looked stems from the cameras that took the photos rather than the content of the photos themselves.

unitedstatesofamerica,38yfya,calrdt12,2,Mon Jun 8 02:06:52 2015 UTC,Georgia does have whale sharks. I used to work at the AOP and we didn't have anything that large. There is a cool saw fish and a few decent sized rays out in Shark Lagoon.
unitedstatesofamerica,38yfya,Rorbotron,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:36:06 2015 UTC,Yea I thought Georgia was one of the aquariums.  Thanks for the confirmation.  I'd probably sit in that area all day just watching and the biggest thing I've seen in a tank has been the manatees.  The Pittsburgh zoo has some cool sand tiger sharks which are pretty large but obviously nothing close to a damn whale shark.  Its gotta be amazing to see.

If you were to go to the other side of the ridge, you'd find a large building that I believe is both a restaurant and a museum showcasing all the different films shot there.

unitedstatesofamerica,33vw7l,cougar69351w,2,Mon Apr 27 21:52:44 2015 UTC,Hi! :) I've lived my whole life in the Inland Empire and being surrounded by mountains. Now I'm in San Diego for college and there aren't really any visible mountains around and I do miss them. Cucamonga Peak & the hike up to it has such breathtaking views especially in the winter after it snows. The picture certainly doesn't do it justice. You can get to the peak hiking along Icehouse Canyon trail and passing Icehouse Saddle. I've averaged around 8-9 hours total finishing the hike (about 5 hrs up and 4 down).

unitedstatesofamerica,3290kv,autowikibot,3,Sun Apr 12 03:45:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Really all of my pictures are taken in an hour vicinity or so of Lincoln.  Admittedly many of my photos are the result of a lot of exploring, I spend way more money on gas than I'd like to admit haha.  It's hard to really suggest a specific area, but I do spend the most time around Branched Oak Lake NW of Lincoln; there's a region of rolling hills in that area referred to as the ""Bohemian Alps"".  Not the typical Midwest flat cornfields.  That area also has a lot of wildlife management areas and ""open waters and fields"" land - areas that landowners have donated for public use (essentially unfarmable land).    My favorite part of the state is definitely the sandhills from central Nebraska to the panhandle, I don't get out there very often but it's definitely a great change of scenery.  Desert-like scenery, and then there's Toadstool Geologic Park -   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toadstool_Geologic_Park ...Although I haven't been able to get out there since having a camera!  It's about the same drive from Lincoln to the pandhandle as it is to Colorado.. which has made the decision tough, lol.  For viewing stars, it seems like any area several miles outside of Lincoln or Omaha and you have a pretty great view, there's not many other towns to contribute light pollution!    Hope you have a good time, I'd like to venture into Iowa sometime as well for a change of pace."

The lens flare is pretty though.  The watermark, while not very noticeable in this picture, takes a lot away from your photos.  I looked at your deviantart profile and you've got some great shots on there that would be a lot better if the watermark was less prominent.  It doesn't have to be in the center of the photo, where the subject of your photos typically are.  So long as it's not easily cropped out you could put it anywhere that would blend in a little better and be less distracting while still protecting your photo.  Again, I'm not trying to hound you.  These are just one man's critiques, and I'm just a normal guy that likes pictures."

The hiking trail starts from Jenny Lake and continues around the lake and up along Cascade Canyon all the way to Lake Solitude, for a total of 9 miles or so. The photo was taken a mile or so before the lake.   From here, you can either go back the way you came or keep going further (the trail does a full loop). If the distance is too much, you can split it over two days since there are backcountry campgrounds along the trail, but it's really hard to get a permit (definitely have to reserve several months in advance)"

unitedstatesofamerica,2z1yw1,autowikibot,2,Sat Mar 14 22:41:27 2015 UTC,"Piedmont (United States):       The Piedmont is a plateau region located in the eastern United States between the Atlantic Coastal Plain and the main Appalachian Mountains, stretching from New Jersey in the north to central Alabama in the south. The Piedmont province is a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian division. The province consists of the Piedmont Upland and Piedmont Lowlands sections.  The fall line marks its eastern boundary with the Coastal Plain. To the west, the Piedmont is mostly bounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains, the easternmost range of the main Appalachians. Physiographically, the Piedmont is considered a province of the larger Appalachian Highlands physiographic division.  The width of the Piedmont varies, being quite narrow above the Delaware River but nearly 300 miles (475 km) wide in North Carolina. The Piedmont's area is approximately 80,000 square miles (210,000 km2).   The name ""Piedmont"" comes from the French term for the same physical region, literally meaning ""foothill"", ultimately from Latin ""pedemontium"", meaning ""the foot of the mountains"". The region is named after the Italian region of Piedmont, the lowlands which abut the Alps.

One of the tallest dams in the world, it is 262 metres (860 ft) high, 27 metres (89 ft) wide and 22.11 metres (72 ft 6 in) thick at the base and 191 metres (627 ft) wide and 3.4 metres (11 ft 2 in) thick at the top.   On 9 October 1963, a massive landslide caused a tsunami in the lake, the overtopping of the dam, and around 2,000 deaths. This event occurred when the designers ignored the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin. Warning signs and negative appraisals during the early stages of filling were disregarded, and the attempt to safely control the landslide into the lake created a 250 metre (820 ft)  megatsunami (ten times higher than predicted) that brought massive flooding and destruction to the Piave valley below, wiping out several villages completely.  On 12 February 2008, while launching the International Year of Planet Earth, UNESCO cited the Vajont Dam tragedy as one of five ""cautionary tales"", caused by ""the failure of engineers and geologists"".

unitedstatesofamerica,2ygqxf,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"2013 El Reno tornado:       During the early evening of May 31, 2013, the widest tornado in recorded history occurred over rural areas of Central Oklahoma. Part of a larger weather system that produced dozens of tornadoes over the preceding days, the tornado initially touched down at 6:03 p.m. CDT (2303 UTC) about 8.3 miles (13.4 km) west-southwest of El Reno. The storm rapidly grew in size and became more violent. Remaining over mostly open terrain, the tornado did not impact many structures; however, measurements from mobile Doppler weather radars revealed extreme winds in excess of 296 mph (476 km/h) within the tornado. As it crossed Highway 81, it had grown to a record-breaking width of 2.6 miles (4.2 km). Turning northeastward, the tornado soon weakened. After crossing Interstate 40, the tornado dissipated around 6:43 p.m. CDT (2343 UTC), after tracking for 16.2 miles (26.1 km), avoiding affecting more densely populated areas near and within the Oklahoma City metropolitan area.

unitedstatesofamerica,2wrp0t,sabresin4,18,Sun Feb 22 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"It was claimed by the US Guano Company in 1860 via the Guano Islands act of 1854. TL;DR, US citizens could claim random unclaimed islands so they could harvest bird poop (a good fertilizer)."
unitedstatesofamerica,2wrp0t,BusterBluth13,10,Mon Feb 23 04:33:17 2015 UTC,"Most likely because a nation's exclusive economic zone extends 200 miles into water from land.

The smallest, which is between the lake and CA-120, is climbable and affords an absolutely amazing view of the lake, the volcanoes, the Sierra Nevada, and Conway Summit on US-395.  Interestingly, standing on top of the volcano gives you a gorgeous view down CA-120 - where you can see how it winds through the mountains to Tioga Pass.  Fascinating.

If I had taken that it would have either blown out the sky or blackened the mountains. Some day I'll really learn how to shoot into the Sun.  :(  On a brighter note, I've traveled to GTNP three times in the past two years, and Schwabacher's Landing has become one of my top places to return to in the park.  There isn't much of a sign indicating the turnoff onto a disappearing dirt road, and there are no major trailheads or anything else to really draw in visitors down into the valley to this location. Thus, it remains a very quiet area of the park and is a favorite of mine for sunrises.  I've had some very tranquil mornings there while the masses are at Mormon Row or Jenny Lake.

unitedstatesofamerica,2s6fno,RedditRuinedMyGrades,5,Mon Jan 12 22:47:42 2015 UTC,New York is definitely attributed to being Gotham much more than Chicago is. There is a New York news site called the gothamist and they were even going to actually use New York but decided to change it to a fictional city instead.

unitedstatesofamerica,2s6fno,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jan 12 23:21:48 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Origin of name of article  Gotham City:       Writer Bill Finger, on the naming of the city and the reason for changing Batman's locale from New York City to a fictional city, said, ""Originally I was going to call Gotham City 'Civic City.' Then I tried 'Capital City,' then 'Coast City.' Then I flipped through the New York City phone book and spotted the name 'Gotham Jewelers' and said, 'That's it,' Gotham City. We didn't call it New York because we wanted anybody in any city to identify with it.""   ""Gotham"" had long been a well-known nickname for New York City even prior to Batman's 1939 introduction,  which explains why ""Gotham Jewelers"" and many other businesses in New York City have the word ""Gotham"" in them. The nickname was popularized in the nineteenth century, having been first attached to New York by Washington Irving in the November 11, 1807 edition of his Salmagundi,  a periodical which lampooned New York culture and politics. Irving took the name from the village of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, England, a place that, according to folklore, was inhabited by fools.  The village's name derives from Old English gāt 'goat' and hām 'home', literally ""homestead where goats are kept"",  and is pronounced ""goat 'em"", /ˈɡoʊtəm/ goat-əm (c.f. Chatham, /ˈtʃætəm/ CHAT-əm, a similar name where the letters th represent a ""t"" sound followed by a silent ""h"" rather than a ""th"" sound). This etymology is cited by the Joker in Detective Comics #880, in which he tells Batman that the word means ""a safe place for goats"".  In contrast, ""Gotham"" as used for New York has a different pronunciation by analogy to other words spelled with ""th"" and is pronounced as /ˈɡɒθəm/ GOTH-əm,  like the word Goth.

It has been regarded as such by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey (NGS) since the 1912 additions of New Mexico and Arizona to the United States.  It is located about 2.6 miles (4.2 km) northwest of the center of Lebanon, Kansas at 39°50′N 98°35′W, which is approximately 12 miles south of the Kansas-Nebraska border. While any measurement of the exact center of a land mass will always be imprecise due to changing shorelines and other factors, the NGS coordinates are recognized in a historical marker in a small park at the intersection of AA Road and K-191. It is accessible by a turn-off from the U.S. Route 281.  It is distinct from the geographic center of the United States, which reflects the 1959 additions of the states of Alaska and Hawaii, which is located at a point northeast of Belle Fourche, South Dakota."

unitedstatesofamerica,2r00jo,Beerquarium,2,Thu Jan 1 10:50:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know, looks like the sun has already risen quite a bit."
unitedstatesofamerica,2r00jo,expert02,2,Thu Jan 1 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"The sun is below the horizon. I had to take a 30 second exposure because it was still so dark. You can tell because there are no harsh highlights and shadows, the light is soft and even and has almost no contrast. I have others where the sun is up in the same location just 20 minutes later and it looks much different."
unitedstatesofamerica,2qx52c,JKastnerPhoto,7,Wed Dec 31 14:20:51 2014 UTC,Sandy Hook?
unitedstatesofamerica,2qx52c,Roentgenator,6,Wed Dec 31 17:35:39 2014 UTC,That is correct.

unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,MsAlign,2,Wed Dec 31 05:10:16 2014 UTC,The back porch view
unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,Save_for_later,4,Wed Dec 31 16:29:47 2014 UTC,Not a bad shack for someone who lived there part time.

unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,Lol_Im_A_Monkey,-5,Wed Dec 31 03:20:28 2014 UTC,Built on the backs of the American worker.   What a beautiful building honoring such a horrible system.
unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,kumachaaan,11,Wed Dec 31 13:58:50 2014 UTC,"George Vanderbilt actually employed most of the entire town of Asheville to build this home and had a rail line installed just to deliver material to the site. He offered blacks a job in the recently defeated confederate south and even supplied work to Native Americans, something unheard of for the 1890's in NC. Equal pay as well.  He constructed them a village on site, called Antler Village, still there today. It was a place for the workers and their families during the decade long construction of the home. There was a school and even a church. When the church was looking for an organ to be played on Sunday's, Vanderbilt himself let the workers borrow his very own Organ that sits in the grand dining room today, until construction was complete.   He believed in equality and human rights in the 1890's.  A bigger man than most people today that make 40k a year.   So yeah, what an asshole."
unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,Lol_Im_A_Monkey,-5,Wed Dec 31 14:30:13 2014 UTC,"Vanderbilt was definitely still a currupt evil  asshole. Just because he did some good things,  doesn't mean he didn't cheat, steal and kill to make his millions. Look at Pablo Escobar."
unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,kumachaaan,5,Wed Dec 31 14:53:46 2014 UTC,"The youngest grandson of the Tycoon Cornelious Vanderbilt, George Vaserbilt inherited the least amount of money of the 8 children.  He is responsible for the creation of the Pisgah National Forrest and our country's first school of forestry. He was far ahead of his time."
unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,Lol_Im_A_Monkey,0,Wed Dec 31 14:57:11 2014 UTC,He made his money off the rail...
unitedstatesofamerica,2qvq9x,kumachaaan,2,Wed Dec 31 14:54:25 2014 UTC,Mostly shipping really. John D. Rockefeller bought out his rail and become a monopoly.

unitedstatesofamerica,2qmse8,WarSheepCoral,4,Sun Dec 28 18:29:37 2014 UTC,I figured it would be close to a 30 second exposure but wow 2000ISO I'm thoroughly impressed with this shot.
unitedstatesofamerica,2qmse8,mostlybran,4,Sun Dec 28 18:38:00 2014 UTC,"Thank you!  The night skies here can be way more impressive but the moon was drowning everything out pretty good, on the other hand its nice that it provided natural light for the foreground.  I can never seem to make things look natural when I use ""light painting"" on the foreground."
