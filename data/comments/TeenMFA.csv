I am convinced that the Tommy Bahama shirt is worth the money. I bought one and my wife actually commented that it was a nice shirt and asked what brand. She told me to get another as it was so nice.  Also, machine washable.  I did buy one in white, black, blue and red.  If you look hard, they are available for about 30% off.

These are my favorite chelseas that I've found so far and I was wondering if anyone that has them can attest to their fit/quality. I would be ok with any other boots in brown or tan suede if anyone has recommendations for some with more room. http://imgur.com/2d5g8S5"

TeenMFA,3dw4z1,SkulduggeryP99,10,Mon Jul 20 00:58:13 2015 UTC,I don't personally wear earrings because they don't really mesh well with my personal style but I think they can look really good if pulled off right. In my opinion earrings / studs look best when worked into street wear type fits for obvious reasons. Honestly earrings can work in a lot of fits so long as they blend into a fit as opposed to becoming a center of attention.
TeenMFA,3dw4z1,Mr_Popty_Ping,5,Mon Jul 20 01:24:35 2015 UTC,"i don't know how much this really contributes but i have had a white gold stud earring in my left ear for about a year now... i never really take it out lol. i feel like i pull it off well and it goes well with my style, but that's just me. i'm considering getting the right one done when football ends in november."

I have a pair of diamonds too but they're too douchey and I'm like a 5' 6"" ginger with glasses so diamonds wouldn't look as badass as I imagine  gauges are okay, the really big ones are pretty stupid/gross to me though."
TeenMFA,3dw4z1,CrazyGingaKid,3,Mon Jul 20 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"I've got gauges, and honestly they don't clash with my style too much. It depends on what you wear honestly. I think anybody can have earrings, it just depends on how you work it into your style. Plus, earrings aren't usually a huge fashion investment, so you can get multiple pairs in various styles depending on what you're wearing."

TeenMFA,3dumdu,TheDutchWonder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:36:10 2015 UTC,"Idk if you like the type of vocals in these songs, but personally I've been digging voices like the lead singers of Andrew Jackson Jihad, Front Bottoms, and The Mountain Goats. Some good songs by them are    Brave as a Noun, by Andrew Jackson Jihad American Tune, by Andrew Jackson Jihad Maps, by the Front Bottoms Au Revoir, by the Front Bottoms This Year, by the Mountain Goats No Children, by the Mountain Goats   They all have kind of nasally voices. By all intents and purposes they should be terrible singers. (A lot of people think they are) To me however, their voices are very aesthetically pleasing. Almost reminds me of Blink 182 or some old popular punk bands."
TeenMFA,3dumdu,Konroy,3,Sun Jul 19 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"Ever since I've listened to Neutral Milk Hotel, I fell in love with this type of very nasal singing. It just feels so natural imo."
TeenMFA,3dumdu,mrblahblahblacksheep,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:52 2015 UTC,Andrew Jackson Jihad is amazing.
TeenMFA,3dumdu,TheDutchWonder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:17:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been listening to them a lot. The Mountain Goats have similar vocals if you like that. Btw do you know where to get official to shirts from them?
TeenMFA,3dumdu,mrblahblahblacksheep,2,Mon Jul 20 06:31:46 2015 UTC,http://ajjstore.bigcartel.com/ is their official store. My friend has this shirt: http://ajjstore.bigcartel.com/product/whale-shirt and it's really sick in real life. If you get a chance to see them in concert they have some other shirts for sale too. Highly recommend seeing them live.
TeenMFA,3dumdu,TheDutchWonder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:34:14 2015 UTC,Wow these shirts are great. It's too bad they have no mediums. :(
TeenMFA,3dumdu,mrblahblahblacksheep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:04:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it's the same supply they use for shows and that's what everyone buys.

Idk. Guess I'm just conservative."
TeenMFA,3dumdu,sonsofjacob,7,Mon Jul 20 11:37:12 2015 UTC,"ok  being conservative is okay if that's what you want, but trying dif things is also fun. i think you're getting downvoted because you're telling people not to experiment  if you're just getting into fashion you'll probably eventually learn that you don't need to follow the ""rules"" or guidelines"
TeenMFA,3dumdu,k00l_m00se,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not new to fashion. I'm just pretty conservative in my fashion. And that hasn't really been welcome here. It's a regional thing I guess. Where I'm from, you have to dress conservative. Or everyone is going to gang up on you and make your life hell. I'm probably gonna hang around on MFA more. They like conservative, simple and basic there."
TeenMFA,3dumdu,argewfhowefh,5,Sun Jul 19 21:56:28 2015 UTC,"dude plenty of posters live in regions where it's odd to wear certain types of clothing  the thing is that these people dress for themselves, not for others, so why should u care if other people dislike it cause it doesnt fit the norm  like i get comments too from my parents and friends at times, i don't care though, i wear these clothes because they make me happy not to please others. if other like it that's just a bonus : )"
TeenMFA,3dumdu,asianfuntime,4,Sun Jul 19 22:08:12 2015 UTC,"well if you wanna not be bullied then sure okay dress conservative to where ever you live  no one's really forcing you to stay on whatever subreddit. if you aren't open minded to what people like and use the excuse of ""sorry I dress conservative"" on why you don't like something then that's lame  I live in the south too, and people give you flak if you dress differently. in the end, no one cares after a day of wearing whatever. people get used to it and it's just normal clothes affiliated to you.   seriously, no one cares after a while"

From what I've seen, having left-leaning political views will be about the only thing that will draw negative criticism, and you can lie about/hide those views."

TeenMFA,3dr2j7,sterling_morrison,4,Sat Jul 18 23:05:18 2015 UTC,shoes are too much of a visual break to work well in the outfit to me and the tee color just seems odd
TeenMFA,3dr2j7,nevergreen,2,Sat Jul 18 23:32:26 2015 UTC,hmm i see what you mean. i like the shoes being such a contrast to the pants because they're pretty close to the color of the pink shirt. i thought it was cool having shoes + shirt having similar light colors combined with the pants and overshirt being similar dark colors. gives it a subtle color blocking feel to it imo

TeenMFA,3diwl1,_mildude,3,Thu Jul 16 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind J Crew may cheap you out on the ratio though. I bought these pants and found out when they arrived that they're only 22% linen and 78% cotton, preventing me form being able to wear them on slightly cooler summer days like I wanted. they also weren't a very lightweight fabric for what they claimed. I was expecting something closer to their regular lightweight chinos but it turns out the weight is closer to regular cotton chinos."

TeenMFA,3degu6,drbirthdayboy,3,Wed Jul 15 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"Not much for clothes stores there unless you really search the internet, and your family probably won't want to drive into downtown Athens or Istanbul just for one store.   I went to the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul like 3 years ago, and it's one of the funnest things I've ever done. It's a giant underground bazaar (market) with lots of clothes, jewelry, food, furniture, rugs, etc. The clothes are generally pretty low quality and there are millions of knockoffs. Still incredibly fun though, probably my favorite memory from Istanbul. If you want the vendors to stop pestering you, don't look them in the eye while walking."

Maintaining strong eye contact, moving the eyes towards the lips and such.   Look at your posture right now. Just stop reading and think about it. Posture can affect how others see us. My resting posture is terrible. I'm currently working to fix it.  You'll be surprised at how even small things make differences. Arms crossed can give different feels and vibes as opposed to hands in pockets.  I got shitty wifi at the moment so I can't really link any videos, but I know there are Ted talks about body language. Also Reddit has a seduction/flirt advice subreddit. I'm not subscribed to it for some reasons, but they do have some interesting articles, books, and posts, Just check what they got on their info section  Cheers, mate!"

As for recommendations, I always go with Giorgio Armani Code, not sure exactly how to describe it, it's mainly citrusy and slightly floral. It's not heavy in any sense. Girls in general love it when men wear cologne, however, girls in high school lean towards lighter scents even if it's some cheap shit from rue21 (not saying you should buy cheap shit though it is absolutely a don't). Anyways lighter scents will help of you're not down to get Armani Code in specific. Word of advice: Don't treat fragrances as an accessory treat as a part of your identity, I'm not sure how to say it without sounding like a pretentious fuck. u/Reas0n once said in a thread similar to this that when people smell the scent they should automatically think ""oh shit, it's that guy.""

TeenMFA,3d125b,Synthbells,4,Sun Jul 12 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"The 1st one could (maybe) be done by doing much larger rolls.  This will be tougher; but when you're rolling the sleeve try and space out each ""fold"" by a few inches rather than the natural one or two you're used tor rolling. Then, for the final roll at the top of your arm; do it by half. This is why you get that ""double stacked roll"".   Dude on the right is totally just wearing a short sleeve tho."

TeenMFA,3d125b,AlienComingIn,44,Sun Jul 12 17:12:39 2015 UTC,We had top of waywt but they stopped cos none of yall had any top fits
TeenMFA,3d125b,Nemost,10,Sun Jul 12 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"We did have a monthly Top Of WAYWT thread awhile back but stopped it because of a few difficulties.   The main problem was the way in which voting on top occurred, as back when TMFA only had a couple hundred/thousand subscribers, the mods at the time would just pick out what they believed the best fits of that month were, being as unbiased as they could, but obviously as the sub grew in size, the amount of fits that had to be voted on increased, and we would end up spending lots and lots of hours just to decide the fits, and it was pretty draining and hard to find a time when all the mods were free to do it so it was often overdue. Also there was the problem that no matter which fits got in, people would often feel that there were fits that missed out when they shouldn't have, and fits that got in when they 'weren't good enough', which obviously, people do have a right to feel that way.  We also tried voting by upvote, and having a threshold like MFA does, but with us being a much smaller sub, one upvote or one downvote on a outfit on here makes much more of a difference than it would on MFA, and so people would begin downvoting others to get their fit to the top and it would make WAYWT a complete competition, which isn't what the thread is about, not to mention that those who were late to the thread often missed out, no matter how good or bad their fit was.  If you have any ideas on how the sub could fairly vote on fits that feel free to tell us, but as it stands, we can't really begin to think about reintroducing it.  EDIT: Also as /u/Discover_and_Become said, the Instagram does a pretty good job of collecting all the most upvoted fits of each thread"
TeenMFA,3d125b,windowflowers,9,Sun Jul 12 17:57:09 2015 UTC,The best fit of the month threads that a couple people were doing weren't a bad idea. Gives people a chance to explain why they like fits too.

TeenMFA,3d125b,aquaticgolfer44,4,Sun Jul 12 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"I think the Instagram is the best bet but, there are some fits I think are cool that don't get put on there and I'm sure there are some people on here that don't want to scroll through and click through every link to look at someone's so I thought it would be nice to just have a big completion of them like the top waywt on malefashionadvice."

I recently lost weight (20 pounds) and have really broad muscular shoulders (not a brag I just play football and lift a lot so none of my shirts fit anymore).  Anybody have any tshirt/basic shirt suggestions? I have a little over 100 bucks to spend on shirts and need some ideas. I have a lot of black shirts and hoodies becasue my school colors are black and silver so I need some color. Maybe red or blue. I like graphic tees more than basic but a solid logo tee is cool to me. My favorite brands are probably Nike, Adidas, Neff, and The Hundreds.   Thanks!"

TeenMFA,3ctubd,JewTurk,21,Fri Jul 10 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"Not entirely disagreeing, but I think the usual ""man bun"" is done slightly different than how a woman would usually do a bun. That's probably something worth taking into account."
TeenMFA,3ctubd,biaxialrhombus,5,Fri Jul 10 21:02:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it's assuming a bit much that calling it a 'man-bun' is preserving masculinity.
TeenMFA,3ctubd,ThisIsJesseTaft,4,Fri Jul 10 22:57:26 2015 UTC,yeah I'm sure that's not the only reason but it's just putting your hair up which isn't exclusive to any gender.

Then read The Grapes of Wrath. It's a long book, but it provides an excellent, haunting story. After that, read East of Eden. It's a beautiful, life changing story. And then finally, read In Dubious Battle. It's a dark, gritty and  bleak story. A good one not by him are The Things They Carried. It's a really heavy, dark story about the Vietnam War. Not at all Camus style, but just as life impacting. Brave New World is another really good one. Brave New World is a good one too. Dark, but really funny. If you want more, just PM me."

A couple years back there was a sentiment beginning to be expressed that it was on it's way out. Maybe it's because the conditions it was a reaction to haven't disappeared?
TeenMFA,3cr1g0,676339784,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:49:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's seen a bit of a revival as more and more literature that isn't Latin American uses magic realism. Don't get me wrong, Allende and Marquez write beautifully and fantastically,  but I think having writers outside the Latin American literary community embrace magical realism in their literature made it really popular again."
TeenMFA,3cr1g0,GreenWhiteDude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"u read kenzaburo oe's stuff yet? he's similar in that way; i think a common trait among japanese lit is how concise and to the point authors are (by which i mean they don't use shorty fluff adjectives and long winded descriptions that turn a 100 page story into a 200 page one), which is why i for one prefer it to the vast majority of other world lit"
TeenMFA,3cr1g0,COoL_COoKiE,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"currently reading Twilight of the Idols by Nietzsche. shit's crazy. part of the reading for this existentialism class i'm taking right now (not even a philosophy major, just taking the class because I love the subject so much). outside of that I just finished Siddhartha by Hesse and trying to wrap up The Picture of Dorian Gray because I keep putting it off and somehow can't read the last 50 pages."
TeenMFA,3cr1g0,COoL_COoKiE,2,Fri Jul 10 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"Siddhartha used to be my favorite book, I re-read it so many times. What did you think of it?  Dorian Gray I can't get more than 50 pages into so you've got me beat lol"
TeenMFA,3cr1g0,biaxialrhombus,2,Fri Jul 10 04:47:16 2015 UTC,"i actually really liked it. I liked Hesse's writing style and it was one of those quick reads but you finished reading and it felt complete (reminds me of when I read Fahrenheit 451 and was genuinely upset that it was so short and felt almost a bit rushed near the end, also the ending was meh but that's just my subjective opinion).  I already know how dorian gray ends which makes it even harder for me to read the conclusion in the writing :// I love spoiling endings and plot twists for myself it's a problem"

I finished Animal Farm the other day, finally crossing it off my to-read list. Once I finish Brave New World Revisited (Brave New World being my favorite book of all time), I plan to move along to All Quiet on the Western Front and Going Solo."
TeenMFA,3cr1g0,sterling_morrison,2,Fri Jul 10 05:19:46 2015 UTC,brave new world is incredible!!! favorite book. 1984 hooked me on dystopian novels and BNW was so much more.
TeenMFA,3cr1g0,john_ft,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"1984 is a fantastic book, capturing the fearsome nature of an all controlling government with an eerie prediction. But what I like about Brave New World, and why I believe it to be an even scarier projection, is that it paints itself as a dystopia, but a pleasant and even somewhat desirable dystopia."

TeenMFA,3cr1g0,MachiaveIli,2,Fri Jul 10 06:11:49 2015 UTC,"if you liked of mice and men you should check out other books by that author! john steinbeck is one of my absolute favorite writers.   East of Eden is probably his hardest novel but it's also the most rewarding to finish in my opinion. massive frission throughout that one. Really hard to put down. ideal summer reading. curl up on the couch with a cat and a glass of lemonade or something  Grapes of Wrath is his best known book, it's quite good. probably his most well-known 'masterpiece' 'magnum opus' type book  tortilla flats! i think this was his breakout novel and it's really funny. same with cannery row. I grew up in california and spent a lot of time in Salinas valley and monterey so these books have extra special meaning to me."

TeenMFA,3cp3fv,mc-lunar,6,Thu Jul 9 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"not necessarily  as far as being ""in"" it's definitely a trend that's on its way out (on the internet and in bigger cities of course, i'm sure if you wear a man bun in nowhere, texas, you'll be feared/revered)  i thought it was worth noting the similarities in timeline of the trend of black leggings + shorts as well as the timeline of the manbun trend  also there's overlap between shorts + leggings people and manbun people"

I'd go with Banana republic ones solely because I prefer khaki but you can go with whatever of the two you want. These shorts are fairly popular right now so you can't go wrong with them."
TeenMFA,3cp3fv,dragoneye898,2,Thu Jul 9 19:26:57 2015 UTC,Do you know if both are around the same fit and style?
TeenMFA,3cp3fv,nikolaprof,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:50:52 2015 UTC,They are of same style. There is probably a small difference between the fits but it's minor. Since you're just getting into fashion I'd recommend that you try them because you might think that they are too short for you if you didn't have any shorts of similar lenght before. That was the case with me when I bought my first over-knee shorts.

I seriously love going to big cities. When I was in Paris the city life was so vibrant and diverse, not to mention nearly everyone there dresses well to some regard. London is much the same, although not as many nicely dressed people, probably cause of the weather. I've seen so many people wearing designers and tons of different high fashion styles. Saw this Asian dude wearing a mix of a suit and a traditional Japanese(?) garment. It was fantastic.  Went to London Soho and picked up a few things from the supreme there. Love that area and the way people were dressed there.  It's also a bit chillier here so I'm testing out some new fall styles I wouldn't get to try back in the states. Will post fits soon. To those that live in bigger, cultural cities, is it normal for you to see people wearing higher fashion clothing? As someone who lives in a boring ag city in California, seeing all these styles up close is really something special."

This exists in the depths of mfa already, but if you have an updated guide that massively improves or builds upon the old one, submit away. Looking from what you have here, it's mostly the same stuff in the mfa guide.   Ps those colored shorts don't exactly look good or look palewave imo."

It is 100% water proof as far as I have tested it. Feels really sturdy but light and manageable. The packability is amazing, I'm sure it'll be great for hiking/camping.   I like the baggier fit, I rolled the sleeves up and I'm sure it'll be cool to take the sleeves of whatever I'm wearing under it and roll those over it. Not really sure how I'll wear it.  Construction is cool. Leather fob-things on the drawstring feels nice, drawstring on the waist too, zip side is nice/makes it easy to take off but would prob function as a good vent for your own use.  Highly recommend, maybe not @$250, though. For me personally I wouldn't pay more than $200 for something up this vein, but that is all subjective. Further wear will only tell if it is a good pick-up, as I'm hoping it'll last me 4-5 years at the least."

TeenMFA,3cg2s1,chpchp,9,Tue Jul 7 19:00:50 2015 UTC,Jeans are too tight but that top is sooooo goooooddd
TeenMFA,3cg2s1,coogisus,3,Tue Jul 7 19:12:50 2015 UTC,i was feeling the contrast in fit between top and bottom
TeenMFA,3cg2s1,michaelmao,12,Tue Jul 7 19:42:10 2015 UTC,contrast works but it doesn't work here.
TeenMFA,3cg2s1,AidanSN,3,Tue Jul 7 20:26:31 2015 UTC,I honestly think that those jeggings are too tight on you for most outfits. I honestly can't think of a way to wear jeggings that would just look better with normal skinny jeans. Everything is good other than that.

TeenMFA,3cg2s1,InvadingCanadian,4,Tue Jul 7 19:00:28 2015 UTC,i like the bulkier shorts with the bulkier shoes tho
TeenMFA,3cg2s1,AidanSN,3,Tue Jul 7 21:28:53 2015 UTC,I think he needs a bulkier top then (maybe a slightly oversized t) to help balance it. Shirt seems a little too slim for the shorts IMO.

TeenMFA,3cg2s1,Thissquirrelisonfire,4,Tue Jul 7 23:18:39 2015 UTC,The polo does not work for me with the rest of it. I think an oversized top of some kind would be better
TeenMFA,3cg2s1,AidanSN,3,Wed Jul 8 03:15:37 2015 UTC,"The polo seems oversized to me, maybe you just don't like the tuck?"
TeenMFA,3cg2s1,Thissquirrelisonfire,2,Wed Jul 8 04:57:25 2015 UTC,Yes I think maybe you are right. I think what I am looking for is more of a lower hanging shirt. Something longer in the body
TeenMFA,3cg2s1,Alt-Ginger,2,Wed Jul 8 05:27:53 2015 UTC,"I actually ended up not tucking it in, but that was just because I didn't want to fret over the tuck for the entirety of the day."

Edit: Now brown suede is another choice I have to consider. So difficult..."
TeenMFA,3cg2s2,chpchp,4,Tue Jul 7 17:29:59 2015 UTC,Brown suede

TeenMFA,3cg2s2,chpchp,5,Tue Jul 7 17:42:25 2015 UTC,Looks just as good as tan with black and light wash and imo better with grey and looks better than black with basically all of those  Also I own a pair

TeenMFA,3cg2s2,Raxophone,5,Tue Jul 7 19:56:15 2015 UTC,Black leather IMO. Black chelseas are sooooo amazing with a monochrome outfit. Tan might look cool now but it may be a little odd during winter. Black will look good all year round.

If youre looking for a simple white shoe, here are a couple more options for you that I like better (and some of them are mostly unpopular, so you won't be wearing the shoe everyone else is):  http://www.newbalance.com/pd/new-balance-crt300/CRT300-HC.html#color=Cream_with_White&width=D (in the Cream with White colorway)  https://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/shoes/sneakers/PRDOVR%7E85231/85231.jsp  http://www.saturdaysnyc.com/item/derek (although the sole is super huge on these and kinda throws off the proportions... still a nice unbranded shoe though)  http://www.finishline.com/store/product/men-s-adidas-originals-stan-smith-casual-shoes?productId=prod768822 (these are Stans but with a gum sole, they look amazing but i havent seen many people with them)  http://www.sneakersnstuff.com/en/product/18235/adidas-rod-laver (these ones look very much like Common Projects, but they're only 80$)  Again if you're only deciding amongst those shoes and I'm giving you needless information, i'll shut up.

Yohji  this happens sometimes with people who have just got into fashion but not enough to where they have developed their own style. from this point you should start exploring different aesthetics and styles which will give you more of an idea in how you want to proceed with fashion. look at stuff that is jarring to the eye.   as you delve more into the fashion world you're gonna see a lot of shit that you like and a lot of shit that you don't like. that's okay, everyone has their own tastes. ask yourself why you like this and not that. as great as you may dress, you're never going to be able to create a personal style if you're only used to wearing, or seeing, MFA clothes (or anything else, but that's what you brought up). challenge yourself.   look at anyone who you think has a cool style. they probably started in the same position you are at the moment. they got to that point through a lot of different experimentation and you can to. don't be afraid to buy something because you think you may not be able to style it ""correctly,"" you have to be able to understand what works together and what doesn't and the only way you'll be able to do that is by trying and failing.   and most importantly over anything just remember to have fun with it."

TeenMFA,3c4ent,Rerrgon,3,Sun Jul 5 01:00:00 2015 UTC,"If you've already developed your style to this point it's probably time to ""reinject"" some personality into your clothes. Start going for things on the edge of your comfort zone, bright patterns you like, odd choices in footwear, stuff that catches your eye and says you. You can't run before you walk, and now it's time to get past the basics. Personality does come out in style, but if you're anything like me, you swung one way before realizing that it wasn't really you."
TeenMFA,3c4ent,IIMaxII,3,Sat Jul 4 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"I kinda disagree. You don't need to go to the edge of your comfort zone, you rather should stay right inside your comfort zone.   In order to develop a personal style you should only buy stuff you really like and would wear 100%. One needs to feel comfortable in his clothes to have that unique personal style that you can pull of.   If you are no fan of bright colors and weird patterns chances are really high you won't wear it and it won't become part of your personal style. Even with only basics you can create a unique style. If you compare eg. Ryan Gosling, Shia LaBoeuf and Harry Styles, these guys have a real basic but still very unique style."

Yes you might not be wearing your favorite t v show shirts but you can throw a band t into simple fits or into a more complex punk fit. I used to be MFA cookie cutter but I branched out, discovered cool brands and designers and new subreddits. I looked through stuff like /r/streetwear /r/theveneration /r/fringefashion /r/sneakers /r/malefashion and took inspiration and found outfits that I like and I just take cues from it. /r/streetwear is now my home and I find interest in so much more than MFA.

TeenMFA,3c4a5h,heigui,5,Sat Jul 4 21:16:11 2015 UTC,what's the difference between an homage and plagiarism? for example why are Hender Scheme products considered homages and not rip-offs.
TeenMFA,3c4a5h,windowflowers,12,Sat Jul 4 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"For Henders, it has a lot to do with the price. They cost a whole lot more than the sneakers they imitate; they aren't taking away profits from other companies, because the people who buy the originals wouldn't buy henders instead. Plus, they're doing something ""different."" Nike or New Balance or whoever hasn't ever made, and likely isn't ever going to make, high quality all natural leather versions of their shoes."
TeenMFA,3c4a5h,heigui,4,Sat Jul 4 18:40:27 2015 UTC,So basically it's okay to take a design or a model of something as long as you do something different with it?
TeenMFA,3c4a5h,windowflowers,6,Sat Jul 4 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"From a creative point of view I'd say yes, from a legal standpoint it's harder to answer. No one has ever taken legal action against hender, as far as I know, though that may be because they don't replicate logos on their shoes. As opposed to say, rick dunks, which aren't really copies of anything Nike made, but rick still got hit with a cease and desist over the swoosh on them."
TeenMFA,3c4a5h,lionfire42,7,Sat Jul 4 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"i think it's both that hender's shoes don't use the logos of the brands they're obviously paying respect to and that they add onto the initial product in the form of better construction and unique materials and design, thereby setting themselves apart from all that zara-esque shit that rips off other designers but gets away with it because no logos are used"

TeenMFA,3bw4hl,TheDutchWonder,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"the main reason I picked these jeans was because of how they sit on top of the shoes. Any baggier and the cuffs start to look weird and come off the sides of the shoes, and also I didn't really want to pinroll(i dont think any baggier pants taper that hard). I was trying to get the pants slim so the silhouette of the pants didnt break abruptly when it transitioned to the shoes(it looks cleaner imo)  maybe link a pic because im a little confused :)"

TeenMFA,3bnhtg,sneh902,3,Tue Jun 30 22:46:49 2015 UTC,That's a really good idea. I should start looking for mid wash jeans.

TeenMFA,3bnhtg,unSeenima,13,Mon Jul 6 04:49:03 2015 UTC,I think it would look p cool if you dropped the tie-dye undershirt and buttoned up the shirt. It just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the outfit.
TeenMFA,3bnhtg,Probably_Not_Kanye,-5,Tue Jun 30 19:54:52 2015 UTC,"because youre asking for opinions, ill give you my own personal opinion. im nitpicking so don't think I'm being a dick.  personally i don't like black and white sk8his. I think all white ones look good though. And they would work here too.  bomber looks fine/good. I think you need a plain undershirt if you want to use that red and black plaid. White or cream. Personally, im not a fan of red + black + white combo because well.. black people. but, with that said. a white t, the red/black plaid, the black bomer + pants, and white sk8his would be a decent fit."

The fit is skinny thigh, but not that much taper. For someone with toothpick legs like mine I don't let them stack. If you're looking for jeans with a more aggressive taper, look elsewhere. But they're EXTREMELY comfy. They feel like sweatpants and they work great for the palewave style they're meant for."

TeenMFA,3bbig5,seeking_perhaps,2,Sat Jun 27 19:41:19 2015 UTC,"I don't have a particular style and my casual wardrobe is constantly evolving for now. My business casual wardrobe is limited. I have a pair of suede bucks and a pair of cheap burgundy dress shoes, a few pairs of chinos (olive, tan, navy) and a few button downs (white, blue, gray, green). So really I'm just looking for ways to expand on a buisness casual look, because this is my first job where I've needed clothes like this. As far as brands and casual looks go I like margiela, acne, thom browne, Story MFG, Dana Lee, and go with uniqlo/muji for cheap stuff. Let's say I have between $800-$1500 to spend. I could expand that, but it's a start point. I don't want a super diverse wardrobe, either. I'd be cool with only picking up 3 or 4 pieces, but I'm not sure where to look, I suppose."
TeenMFA,3bbig5,lionfire42,4,Sat Jun 27 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"your inspiration seems to be very diverse, so there's a lot you could do here.   low top docs would definitely be a good purchase for you no matter what (especially when paired with acne and dana-esque clothing), although a slimmer oxford (think red wing postmans or story trf shoes) wouldn't hurt if you end up going more thom browne than anything else. uniqlo does have some cool blazer/pant (or short, if shortsuits float your boat) combinations, but, seeing as it's the middle of summer, most sizes on these are gone and it's likely that the lighter, more summer-friendly options won't be back until next summer rolls around. as for shirts, if you feel that interesting patterned shirts will help out your wardrobe then it'd be wise to stock up on a few if you don't already have any. thrifting (if you've got access to a thrift store) or going to your local h&m or gap would be the cheapest way to do this. if you're not feeling that, though, acne's got some interesting minimal shirts that would probably pass as ""business casual"" right now, and their fellow scandinavian basic maker our legacy has some good stuff on sale that somehow managed to not sell out yet.  doing some research of your own wouldn't hurt, though. look through all of the aforementioned designers for inspiration, and try to take the bits and pieces of each designer that you like the most and mix them all up to create an aesthetic that speaks to you the most. tmfa is willing to help you if you ever need help doing that!"

TeenMFA,3b3d07,McMuffinT,5,Thu Jun 25 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"its alright but im not sure if the denim on denim works, i think a different shirt might be a better choice."
TeenMFA,3b3d07,Datzcoo,3,Thu Jun 25 19:49:42 2015 UTC,I thought I'd switch it up and go denim on denim. Thanks for the advice though!
TeenMFA,3b3d07,slumdog_mignolet,2,Thu Jun 25 21:57:48 2015 UTC,if you still wanna wear denim you could just wear black jeans instead that would do away with the somewhat jarring blue denim on blue denim combo
TeenMFA,3b3d07,McMuffinT,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:31:51 2015 UTC,"i think the button denim needs to be a lot darker for it to work, a darker indigo with less fades or black would be cool, although the original is not bad. denim on denim is just tricky."
TeenMFA,3b3d07,Datzcoo,3,Thu Jun 25 23:35:16 2015 UTC,"Good advice. I see what you're saying. It can be a little much, but that's the mood I was in. Not how I typically dress. Thank you for the help!"

TeenMFA,3b3d07,showdemuf,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:41:16 2015 UTC,undershirt definitely pinches a lot and its super drapey fabric. i do wish the sweatshirt had a looser waist
TeenMFA,3b3d07,sonsofjacob,2,Thu Jun 25 22:17:11 2015 UTC,yeahh looser waist on the hoodie would definitely be beneficial

TeenMFA,3b3d07,HitlaryClinton,4,Thu Jun 25 22:33:56 2015 UTC,Feel like you shouldn't cuff the sleeves and the shirt could be a size up. Love the first one though
TeenMFA,3b3d07,i_touch_narwhals,7,Thu Jun 25 17:33:16 2015 UTC,I think the shirt fits perfect.
TeenMFA,3b3d07,HitlaryClinton,6,Thu Jun 25 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Not for this fit. It woukd be good if he was wearing other slim fitting stuff but he's going for a retro vibe and a baggy top would complete that. I mean just look at the windbreaker, the bagginess of it works so well with the shorts and the af1s"
TeenMFA,3b3d07,i_touch_narwhals,5,Thu Jun 25 19:05:25 2015 UTC,"Not every article of clothing has to have similar proportion for a fit to be cohesive, especially in this particular case because once he takes off the wind breaker, the af1s and shorts still work well with the shirt, just in a different way."

TeenMFA,3b0ufr,-bad-advice-,0,Thu Jun 25 03:30:41 2015 UTC,"hmm i guess i kind of agree, i was looking more at their outfits as a whole than at the individual pieces..   what i meant was, the look that is being shown off in those pictures would be very hard to pull off if you ask me"
TeenMFA,3b0ufr,taylorswiftqt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:42:42 2015 UTC,"what do you mean by ""hard to pull off""?"

TeenMFA,3b0ufr,taylorswiftqt,3,Thu Jun 25 04:07:59 2015 UTC,do the people in the lookbook look silly? i don't think so. it may be a different look than what you're used to but that doesn't make it bad or silly.
TeenMFA,3b0ufr,-bad-advice-,-1,Thu Jun 25 04:21:22 2015 UTC,That's not what I said.. I said it looks good on the models but it's hard to make it look that good.. That's what I meant by hard to pull off

TeenMFA,3b0ufr,BritishBrownie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:36:16 2015 UTC,"I really like some of their stuff but idk how I would feel wearing it, which is a shame because i'd try it if not for the price point - not that the stuff is super expensive because comparatively it isn't, but I can't go anywhere near affording that for regular clothes, let alone experimental fits.  If the aesthetic filters down in a few years and I have a job it'd be ideal, means I can try it for cheap and go for the real thing."

TeenMFA,3az09w,asianfuntime,6,Wed Jun 24 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"lol I feel bad for /u/proamateur on his removal  anyways, the anesthesia knocks you out within 5 minutes and it feels like a 10 second nap. I woke up with a mouthful of cotton balls and had a very bad response to the anesthesia. the staff didn't have any wheelchairs so they had to walk me out to the car, which was very inconvenient since they got the smallest nurses to carry me  I tripped out hard and just laid in bed for 2 days. I got pretty bad headaches and I looked like a squirrel because of how swollen my cheeks were. also couldn't eat solid foods without any pain for about a week and a half.  if I were you, eat food that's room temperature. it's a lot more comfortable. just follow what your doc says and you shouldn't have any profound effects or infections. most people fare well after surgery, so I think you should be fine. if you get my situation, sucks brio"
TeenMFA,3az09w,proamateur,2,Wed Jun 24 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"I was in a pretty rough situation over my spring break. I got all 4 removed, with 2 impacted (sideways), and a cyst covering 1 of them. They had to cut some of my jawbone out to get to the bottom ones. The swelling was pretty crazy, didn't go down for a week or two.  But other than that, I actually didn't mind the experience. All I did was chill on the couch, watch tv, eat some Mac and cheese and ice cream, and chill out on painkillers. Just follow what the doctor tells you to avoid a dry socket, and you'll be fine."

TeenMFA,3auls9,gethdrips,7,Tue Jun 23 19:06:17 2015 UTC,I really don't love how slim the shorts are in the second fit - I think the relaxed fit of the shirt would look wayyy better with some looser shorts

TeenMFA,3aqakq,mc-lunar,5,Mon Jun 22 23:10:58 2015 UTC,youre not gonna find something similar for 150
TeenMFA,3aqakq,Discover_and_Become,2,Tue Jun 23 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard (rlly not the word of God here) This brands qual is not great.   That shape is interesting, guessing you have some plans for it? Beyond what you already do with that AA jacket  I'd say cop, for the price, nice experimental piece.  Idk but maybe you will like Soundclips linen/wool coat.  Look up Soundclip big cartel.   That's just a suggestion, it'll be a bit cheaper."
TeenMFA,3aqakq,pillboxlover,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty cool, but there's probably some cheaper alternatives out there. If there isn't anything else, cop."
TeenMFA,3aqakq,argewfhowefh,2,Mon Jun 22 23:24:06 2015 UTC,please give me the cheaper alternatives or is it just a guess ):   i have a hard time finding one with a 'big' fit like this one has
TeenMFA,3aqakq,Stolsdos,6,Mon Jun 22 23:42:38 2015 UTC,I seriously doubt there are cheaper alternatives besides milsurp which wouldn't fit the same.
TeenMFA,3aqakq,argewfhowefh,2,Mon Jun 22 23:55:34 2015 UTC,"i think you're right. the coat itself is super cheap, shipping just kills it. prolly won't find a better alternative. worth a shot though."
TeenMFA,3aqakq,pillboxlover,2,Mon Jun 22 23:59:09 2015 UTC,Haha it was really just a guess based on my own experience. I was looking for a similar sort of coat and it looked like I was going to have to fork out £70/80 for one. But I tried to thrift around and I saw a few good ones for half that price. But then I also looked on e-bay and got one that was just what I was looking for priced £10.   http://i.imgur.com/sd0rRuX.jpg lol

TeenMFA,3aqakq,argewfhowefh,8,Sun Jun 28 13:44:19 2015 UTC,if you insist on black i'd go teva. i think birks look better in other colorways though.

I took some cool fit pics I'll load up on tuesday. A lot of tourist trap things were done. I went up the empire state building, to the statue of liberty, and through Times Square. The best was the today show though. Not because of the actual show, Fuck that. Because I got chosen to go up by the singer that day, which happened to be Nate Reuss. He's the main singer of Fun if you don't know who he is. I high fived him and I was on TV a lot. Here's how close I was to him. I'll load up an album of the pictures I took in NY in a couple minutes. It's good to be back.   Edit: This should be an album of some of the pictures I took during the trip."

But yeah, I think the second, first, and third look good on you, in that order. You seem to have a pretty oval-ish face so any shape of glasses should be fine. So imo go for the second ones, and if you end up not liking them, you can return them (as long as they are cheap and returnable as you say.)"

TeenMFA,3aa2h0,lgnitionRemix,9,Thu Jun 18 13:00:29 2015 UTC,What is tmfa style  Most good street wear doesn't do sales  Brand image is big  They have a bunch of boutique sales up rn  I'm just sorta lost as to what the point would be?
TeenMFA,3aa2h0,Discover_and_Become,6,Thu Jun 18 13:07:25 2015 UTC,Most good street wear doesn't do sales   local stores do sales and a thread here where you can share them would be very good
TeenMFA,3aa2h0,lgnitionRemix,2,Thu Jun 18 13:12:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking brands, but yeah, I guess, go for it.  At the same time tho u could contribute to FMF with those sales."
TeenMFA,3aa2h0,lgnitionRemix,3,Thu Jun 18 13:19:23 2015 UTC,"FMF is rather rude and they tend to get pissed of at stuff that is not ""frugal""  also most of these high end sales are sometimes only in certain locations which makes making a thread on FMF pointless or they're very limited (only like 2 items in stock). I'd rather share that here."

My duties include creation of marketing and advertising campaigns, brand development, communication with the brands we carry (aka cooperating on advertising efforts), and getting paid to Instagram.  A huge part of my vetting process for this job was showing off the work I had done though reddit. Believe it or not, your daily contribution (and hopefully, your internal drive to produce increasingly better contributions) to an online fashion community inadvertently produces a TON of high quality content. My participation in WAYWT posts, the 30 day challenge and my write-up for that, and the quantifiable “style evolution” I was able to show through my posts that functioned as a mood board for my interview.   The future looks bright, fam. Stay tuned for more “momma we did it” posts. If you’re interested in what I’m doing, shoot me a PM and I’ll distribute social media links."

Like no the sole and upper is kinda similar but the full upper on these is prime knit which on it's own is impressive and these also have a mostly boost sole. If anything these should be compared to Pure Boosts or lifestyle versions of Ultra Boosts, idk though. Sure $200 but you're probably paying for $150 of tech and shoe and another $50 of Yeezy's name."

TeenMFA,3a6m66,isnoreyoudrive,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:14:59 2015 UTC,Was it just your dislike of the focus ring or was it really difficult to actually get stuff in focus?

TeenMFA,39ykkz,drewdy123,13,Mon Jun 15 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"most of the stuff on fashion forums and subs aren't going to be normal - simply because most people don't care about clothing, or at least not nearly as much as most people on here. not only that, but to be active on fashion forums and posting consistent waywt's means you usually care even more than the lurkers/other people on here, and those people usually like to experiment and/or wear stuff they enjoy and like and even venture into the more artistic side of fashion rather than the side that's more about looking good to everyone else. that's probably because preppy is pretty much the best style if you want to look good, and that can get boring for a lot of people, especially if they're been into fashion for a while."

Got some good scores and I got some good options. Now I'm not guaranteed the job i want but I'm going through a different program than most people so I will get one of my top two picks.   Option 1. Become a still photographer and travel the world and just do things that i love. Thinking about it, I'm pretty sure it's my dreamjob. I've been into photography for as long as i can remember and I know that I want it to continue to be a big part of my life.   Option 2. Go into a cyber/electronic field. Now the job I'm being pressed into by my dad, consists of fixing servers and routers, general troubleshooting, advanced IT stuff. But the plus side is if you used your time well, after a 4-6 year enlistment, people easily get jobs that pay 80k-150k.   I'm being pressured by my dad to pick these lucrative electronic jobs.. he know a few friends that took that path and make 60k with no degree... but I'm just really divided here. I don't want to live with a huge regret..."

So if I were you I'd start with photography as soon as possible and try to do it for a year or 2 (I'm not familiar with proffesion of photographer so not sure if you need more time) and then try and get a job that your dad wants you to have.

TeenMFA,39q0xy,_trash,7,Sat Jun 13 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"I'm extremely surprised to see a matching sweatshirt and sweatshorts. I think it turned out pretty well but I think it would be hard to justify choosing that combo if the brand wasn't what it is. Also, as inoffensive and basic as those two pieces are why did you decide to go with the patchwork slip ons? I think white sneakers would work really well here."
TeenMFA,39q0xy,mc-lunar,5,Sun Jun 14 02:30:46 2015 UTC,this is awesome

TeenMFA,39q0xy,defcon25,4,Sun Jun 14 16:26:01 2015 UTC,not a fan of the matching top & shorts
TeenMFA,39q0xy,lionfire42,6,Sat Jun 13 19:46:45 2015 UTC,why not? that was kind of the point of the fit
TeenMFA,39q0xy,defcon25,13,Sat Jun 13 21:54:55 2015 UTC,"Well, that's what I'm saying; I don't like the fit. Two of the same color on top of each other like that looks odd to me, though I can see why you & others might like it. Just not my thing. I do like the color though"
TeenMFA,39q0xy,dindonfootball,-3,Sat Jun 13 22:41:40 2015 UTC,thx for sharing

TeenMFA,39q0xy,Alt-Ginger,3,Sun Jun 14 03:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well it seems like you're kind of dead set on exactly matching your sweatshirt and shorts for whatever reason, but I have a similar colored sweatshirt and I think it looks pretty good with lightwash jeans. Just an idea, but we seem to have pretty different tastes so not sure if that would be appealing to you."
TeenMFA,39q0xy,lionfire42,4,Sat Jun 13 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"will try with light wash jorts  my legs will definitely miss not having sweat, though"

TeenMFA,39q0xy,lionfire42,3,Sat Jun 13 22:07:56 2015 UTC,go shopping for cheap light jeans that at least fit you in the waist and then go from there
TeenMFA,39q0xy,chpchp,0,Sat Jun 13 22:15:46 2015 UTC,That would completely change the vibe and intention of the outfit
TeenMFA,39q0xy,AidanSN,9,Sat Jun 13 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"he was just offering another idea for a way to wear the piece, not necessarily suggesting a change to the outfit."
TeenMFA,39q0xy,slumdog_mignolet,2,Sat Jun 13 19:42:27 2015 UTC,yes it would but  i think /u/Alt-Ginger's point was that it might make the outfit a little bit more visually appealing.

My current gf has a lot of scars from her tomboy phase, and I'm really trying to convince her that they aren't even that noticeable, and they're totally nothing to be embarrassed about. Unless your legs are actually super fucked up, you don't have to bother with super long socks. Chances are you look fine, and scars can actually tell a story about who you are. If you really aren't comfortable though, you would have to go for a more relaxed skater kinda fit, so maybe get some destroyed jorts/chino shorts, and put them with tube socks like this or this or an old-school gym class look"

TeenMFA,39gw5t,Shizzable,4,Thu Jun 11 17:21:11 2015 UTC,It depends on what you're comfortable with and what looks good on your body.

TeenMFA,39gw5t,dindonfootball,5,Thu Jun 11 17:33:35 2015 UTC,I don't think we should tell people they can't wear certain things because their body looks a certain way. Just wear as short or as long as you think looks good.

TeenMFA,396n9w,akuroniumu,6,Tue Jun 9 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"Unpick hem  Stab holes around the bottom, making sure to get some holes close to the now-raw hem  Pull holes bigger by hand but don't overdo it  I ruined one tshirt before this one trying it out  Use long tshirts, I used an xl qlo dry package which I stretched out for abit before."

TeenMFA,396n9w,biaxialrhombus,11,Tue Jun 9 17:57:54 2015 UTC,nope I don't care about that at all it's just that it's a pretty normal fitting normal looking shirt that i don't think looks really good with the Rick tank and Rick shorts. if you didn't have the t it would be fine I think or if you just had the tank like I said. like yeah it looks ok and I'm nit picking but it's an advice forum right

TeenMFA,396n9w,craymond123,9,Tue Jun 9 17:20:51 2015 UTC,"I think that the clashing florals is a miss in general, a cuff that wasn't as chunky wouldn't be so bad but rn it fucks up the silhouette."

TeenMFA,396n9w,mrblahblahblacksheep,2,Tue Jun 9 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"Second fit looks good.   First fit needs a little work. That shirt looks really weird. I think it would help if you didn't button the top button, but to be completely honest it's not a very good luck. As for the sweater it would look much better on its own without a shirt underneath.

TeenMFA,396n9w,lionfire42,7,Tue Jun 9 22:19:11 2015 UTC,"Feedback with reasoning behind it, maybe??? For the most part, all I ever see on this sub is stuff like ""I don't like those shoes, so you should swap them out"" or ""those shoes suck,"" with no explanation as to why. Advice like that might as well be pulled out of the advice giver's ass; whenever I see a post without reasoning behind it, I immediately discard whatever advice said post is throwing at me.   I just want people to actually think and give reasons to support the things they say when giving advice, not just see something and immediately feel the need to comment on it. Considering the arsthetic you think the poster is going for is essential here too; if you can't discern that, a comment like ""what look were you going for here?"" wouldn't hurt. This ain't a hard or long task to do, something as easy as saying ""those shoes are bulky to the point where the disproportionality of pants and shoes messes with the slim aesthetic you were going for, and not in the way you wanted to"" would be preferable.  Erolsonhue has said this time and time again, but now that he's 20 and doesn't come here anymore, someone else has to."

TeenMFA,38tbf0,professor_seuss,2,Sat Jun 6 22:59:13 2015 UTC,I really dig the tuck but something about the length of the shirt vs shorts makes it look like your torso is super long.

TeenMFA,38jibt,gingerbeast124,2,Thu Jun 4 19:54:07 2015 UTC,Because you want your feet to stay cool? Plus sandals are a lot more comfy without socks.

I mean, what you're wearing is pretty basic stuff and nothing too outnofnthe ordinary, and there is nothing wrong with that. just keep experimenting and relying out different things. also pose is a little weird, looks try hard and a lot of things in the background are distracting, try posing near something blank (brick wall ect).   edit: also hands out of pockets help, and not sure of you meant to cuff that coat but do not do that, and maybe try a small cuff on the shorts to add a little something; like I said experiment and have fun. good luck, hope to see more from you."

My personal thoughts about this are that when you're trying to get into fashion, you need to understand the basic rules of how to dress first, and then you can incorporate more interesting things in.  I believe that there is one unbreakable rule of fashion, and it is that things need to fit properly. At the start, slim fit clothes are the way to go, and then later you can evolve to add in different styles, like the anti-fit that is oft seen in WAYWTs on this sub."

Like there's nothing wrong with sperrys, but there are also so many more pairs of shoes a teen could get away with that are more interesting or fun."
TeenMFA,38gfk9,Ninenetman,0,Thu Jun 4 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"I just suggested the Roshes because they are in his price range, they're sturdy, they aren't completely white, they're easy to clean, and they come in different styles so they can match so many different things. But for a starter I would highly recommend Sperrys. They're still popular(ish) and they match almost anything. They may not be super formal, but they work for dang near every occasion, and there are so many knock offs that you could probably find several decent pairs of brown boat shoes that are well with the price range."

Fucking insane.Throughout this tour he's been saying he'd send OVOfest to the loudest city on the tour but that was us (obv just trying to get crowds hyped but still fun)  Plus he played Tuesday on Tuesday in Toronto, threw in a freestyle at the end of the show, came out for an encore, played for like an hour and a half, all around great performance. Hometown show though. Plus I was sedated for some medical stuff so I was kinda loopy throughout  Wish he played best I ever had but that's my only gripe"

TeenMFA,38e899,nikolaprof,8,Wed Jun 3 23:58:48 2015 UTC,"Just 2 more weeks until school ends here. I already feel the break. It's going to be awesome! I hate when it's too hot outside... and I think it's gonna be too hot all summer long... I haven't shopped in a while and I'd like to buy some fancy solid color tees.   I also started feeling weird about dressing up different than my friends. I tend to wear stuff that they just don't. It never bothered me before, but now, although I love wearing those clothes, I feel like I'm not like them if that makes any sense..."
TeenMFA,38e899,depression1017,6,Wed Jun 3 20:07:17 2015 UTC,i kinda identify w the second feel but for me when i started caring more about clothes they kinda followed on ? like i feel like i influenced them and whenever we'd go out id take them to all the shops i shop at etc... its not like making them a copy of you but just like exposing them to your style... it made me feel less conscious about it bc they kinda then appreciated that its just what i do and it didnt feel as weird
TeenMFA,38e899,nikolaprof,3,Wed Jun 3 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"Ehh my pals aren't that much into fashion. Actually they aren't into fashion at all. When we're out in town, I always feel like visiting some shops but I never do it because I know none of them like clothes and shopping. Also I feel like people sometimes think I'm too dressed up. Like for example I was out last Saturday with a smaller group of friends and everyone was just wearing shorts or jeans and a tee, and I was wearing black chinos and an elongated tee with zips. I really loved that outfit, just kinda felt strange. It's not that my clothes are super expensive - it's quite the opposite. I always buy on sales and in cheaper shops. Feels so messed up man. Lately I even had thoughts of trying to dress to fit in with my peers as much as possible and I do it from time to time as much as I can. Just for an example my favorite pair of shoes is a kicked up pair of grey vans authentics (they even have a few holes) and almost nobody even wears vans at my school."
TeenMFA,38e899,EzSkinzEzlyfe_,2,Wed Jun 3 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"Where do you got to school? Just curious. I like dressing slightly against the grain imo, most kids that i go to school with wear basketball shoes.

TeenMFA,38e899,EzSkinzEzlyfe_,2,Wed Jun 10 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right now there's a lot of kids who are going to private school for high school and are dressed in the uniform for the last few days of middle school and public school. All I see is vineyard vines and huf. There's a really strange mix of wannabee gangsters, actual gang members (few and far between), and snobby preps who all live in one rich, white neighborhood that lies in our school district as of right now. It's pretty cool to see all of the different styles colliding there, and to see how the different kids get a long. Here's a hint: they don't get along very well."
TeenMFA,38e899,kpals,3,Wed Jun 10 19:48:05 2015 UTC,Find a friend who likes fashion. I got lucky that one of my friends already was sort of into fashion. He's more into just rapper gear and ship but none the less I will show him some shit and with time his taste has definitely changed for the better. I have another friend who wasn't into fashion but because he liked how I dressed he would talk to me about it and I haven't talked to him in a minute but he is semi into fashion now.

TeenMFA,38e899,Shizzable,7,Thu Jun 4 16:25:22 2015 UTC,So every year since 7th grade so far I've been able to do some sort of video project for my English class. I just finished our project for To Kill a Mockingbird and I'm pretty proud of it. It's great to look back at the ones from 7th and 8th grade on my channel and see how my friends and I have evolved  (even though I did it with different people this year cuz out English class got split).  I think it'd be awesome to have at least one video project from 7th-12th grade so I can look back on all the stuff I did.

TeenMFA,38e899,mc-lunar,7,Wed Jun 3 20:48:20 2015 UTC,first of all wtf  second of all LA is kinda a mediocre city for tourism  SF would be my first pick followed by NY  why seattle?

TeenMFA,38e899,drbirthdayboy,2,Sun Jun 7 04:19:31 2015 UTC,"San Francisco is incredible. Some of my favorite stuff there was Alcatraz, Biking over the Golden Gate to Sausalito, Chinatown (probably the best one in the country), and generally just walking around the city. The city is so interesting and diverse (culturally and geographically), and walking around for a couple hours will make you appreciate the design of the place.  About 40 minutes North by way of the Golden Gate is Muir Woods, which is gorgeous and offers lots of great hikes through giant redwoods. If you're going with your family, definitely consider making a trip up there. When you reach the top, you get a great view of the Pacific.  I have a lot of bias because I go there to visit my sister about twice a year, but I genuinely enjoy it much more than LA or New York. Los Angeles is nice, but there is not as much to do for tourism besides big things like Hollywood. The weather is better, but some people like SF's marine layer. A lot of stuff in LA is guided as well, and I think going around by yourself definitely helps to immerse you. As for New York, I haven't been there in a few years, but I remember heavy traffic, constant noise, and angry people. Sorry if I offend anyone, but that left me with a pretty bad impression. On the fashion side of things, New York is unparalleled. You will not get that wide selection of stores anywhere else. I haven't been to Seattle yet, but I plan to go this summer to look at some schools. Maybe someone else can help you out with that.  Hopefully this helped you out."
TeenMFA,38e899,silentnighthd,3,Thu Jun 4 08:40:56 2015 UTC,"I must say, I went to SF maybe 3 or 4 years ago and I really loved it, everything about it.  The weather is great, the people are great, walking around was great, you made remember just how great it is"

TeenMFA,388py0,PossomAloysiusJenkns,2,Tue Jun 2 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that it wasn't optimal, but i wore them for a few reasons.   First, because they were kinda expensive (allen edmonds) so I want to get as much wear out of the few semi formal events I have.  Second, I woulda worn my boots but it was too hot and i wanted to experiment, and these are really the only other formal shoes that would have been applicable.   If I had CPs i would have worn those, but it was either my shitty old vans or superstars (not exactly minimal lol) as far as white sneakers."

I kinda like the bagginess of the outfit. you look very relaxed and it looks comfortable. Only thing i would change is the shoes. I don't really dig the light brown/blue(?) of the jacket contrast.

TeenMFA,388py0,Shizzable,-2,Tue Jun 2 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"The shirt is too long for you. It makes you look like one of these. Also, what kind of shirt is that? it looks like a Collar/Sweater hybrid from the bottom of the sternum down.  to avoid that, look for a shirt brand that fits your body proportions. For example, My torso is longer than my legs so in order to get the proportions right I need to buy shorter shirts. Some of the best shirts that fit me are Arizona Crew Necks. It helps that they're on sale right now for only 6$ a pop.  For the pants, are you wearing straight legged pants? are they tapered at all? It's not an insult just curious questions.  From what I can see, the length seems to be of no problem to the outfit or to you. The length looks fine. For curiosity's sake, how many times did you cuff them?  Aside from that, I dig the shoes, the colors are very neutral and they work well together as a nice low-key outfit. Good job! I don't mean anything as an insult, I'm just letting you know what I, personally, like and dislike about the outfit."

TeenMFA,38aehc,jegbyrd,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"There's an anime if your interested, it's a fun watch, again, though, a shoujou, so you might not like the fact that the protagonist is a girl (personally I did though, I hate Japanese male protagonists they're too lame)  The OP to the anime is catchy as fuck too (if you recognize the singer, it's because it's Asuna from SAO's VA) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYAA8jQ1BH8"
TeenMFA,38aehc,Amateur_American,2,Wed Jun 3 01:27:42 2015 UTC,I hated SAO to be honest. A lot of people enjoy it because I assume it's their first anime or death note for the new people to anime. But I can't stand SAO. It was a good idea but the whole mommy daddy thing was just cringy.
TeenMFA,38aehc,gingerbeast124,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:22:09 2015 UTC,"Dude does anyone even like SAO.  Your right it's absolutely horrendous.  That's basically the only thing r/anime can agree on.  But I'm still gonna give the VA props for being a catchy singer.  The worst part of the show was how great the world building was, and then how bad the rest of the show tried to ruin all that.  The author literally killed his own work by refusing to respect his audiences intelligence or the integrity of his characters.  But Reki Kawahara is backtracking and trying to fix that with ""Progressive"", which goes floor by floor in Aincrad, if you want to read that.  i know I won't though, it's a waste of my time for something that'll probably just be okay"
TeenMFA,38aehc,SkulduggeryP99,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:38:39 2015 UTC,"I don't read manga, just watch the animes. I watched deadman's wonderland and it ends on a bad ending but the manga finishes it up. Only time I've ever read a manga. I prefer to read actual stories when it comes to reading. SAO had good action scenes and stuff but the dialogue within the show felt like it was written by a 9 year old. So many things in the story don't make sense, like he could've saved the low level girl but he refused to because he wanted to keep his high level a secret. But she was the only one still alive within the room which would of resulted in nobody even knowing except her."
TeenMFA,38aehc,Wadriner,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:42:11 2015 UTC,Tbh alot of Japanese things feel like they're written by a 9 year old.  Alot of it is objectively bad writing

I wear a 12-12.5, I'm 6'1"" so they don't look terribly disproportionate, but they're noticeably longer than average and it seems like certain shoes highlight this fact.  I've been wearing adidas sambas (traditional black/white stripes) for like 3 years now, and my current pair is quite literally falling apart so I've been on the lookout for other shoes to try.  I'm not as ""stylish"" as most of the guys on here, but to give a general idea of my look:  I am of a slim build.  I tend to wear darker wash slim fit jeans or simple khaki shorts, a short sleeve shirt of some sort, and a flannel or zippered hoodie.  I'm looking for a shoe that's more fashionable than a sneaker or something, but nothing too ""out there"".  Thanks"
TeenMFA,388py4,PossomAloysiusJenkns,2,Tue Jun 2 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"a minimal white sneaker probably would stand out the least.  Also some stupid advice that could easily help you: are you actually a 12-12.5? Try on smaller shoes/brannock to make sure. the reason being that for whatever reason i thought i was size 12-12.5 for like 2 years before I actually tried on something smaller and realized it fit way better. I actually am size 10.5-11.   As I said, doubt this is the case, but just throwin it out there"
TeenMFA,388py4,drummingsoccerdude,2,Tue Jun 2 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion.  I'm confident that my size is correct- I have very long toes, especially my big toe, so it's obvious when a shoe is too small and it presses into my toe."

Gettin' little fitness gains because I've barely had time to start working out again now that school is wrapping up. Also went to a music festival last weekend in El Paso (Texas) and saw G-Eazy/J Cole/Kaskade/a few others in concert. I only really like G-Eazy but it was still really fun, plus, all the fits I saw were better than mine.  Still a bit worried for finals, though. My school had this thing where you're exempt from some exams if you don't have any more than three excused and no unexcused absences. But they fuck up everytime my parents call in so I'm not exempt from fuckin' anything, but ah well, I can't complain.  Also, does anyone know what's the best tan 5-panel I could get for <$40?

TeenMFA,37v1v0,aquaticgolfer44,2,Sat May 30 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure man, maybe mine were just extra long. Those are the standard Sk8 Hi laces."

TeenMFA,37v1v0,windowflowers,1 point,Sat May 30 17:27:58 2015 UTC,high tops and long shorts are a great way to make your legs look really squat... which usually isn't what you want to do
TeenMFA,37v1v0,spencer102,6,Sat May 30 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"come on, high tops with shorter shorts just looks weird and unbalanced a lot of the time. longer shorts works a lot better in cases. think about rick pods and stuff.  see this too  and this (actually long socks, but same principle.)  and this"
TeenMFA,37v1v0,jegbyrd,6,Sat May 30 22:33:10 2015 UTC,"the examples you gave look dope, but i said ""usually"" for a reason. those aren't exactly common styles of clothing"

TeenMFA,37v1v0,mrblahblahblacksheep,1 point,Sun May 31 18:08:47 2015 UTC,Yes it is. Unfortunately I had to pin roll instead of rolling a simple cuff because the jeans I was wearing didn't have a slim enough taper :(
TeenMFA,37v1v0,SheWasntEighteen,2,Sun May 31 19:25:05 2015 UTC,Maybe a little looser of a pin roll would look better with this.

TeenMFA,37v1v0,-Clarkasaurus-,2,Sun May 31 17:29:55 2015 UTC,"pants too tight and socks look funky with the shoes. Jack is also tight, so I would advise keeping it unbuttoned. Tie know I feel needs work as well, but that could just be the picture. colors in this are great and you have fantastic hair. Don't get caught up in what in what other people have to say just swag out."

TeenMFA,37v1v0,shredtasticman,3,Sat May 30 20:27:45 2015 UTC,i think some looser fitting jeans would fit the cuts better. cuts signify a more relaxed look and skinny jeans don't really compliment that. but it's also not necessarily a bad thing. it looks fine its just my personal preference that it doesnt.

TeenMFA,37v1v1,chpchp,2,Sat May 30 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"So I'm on Grailed eyeing a Raf piece, so I ask the seller for a tagged pic. He however responds with this, which to me is kind of sus. He does have a good review on Grailed though (two 5/5 ratings). But at the same time, if he was truly interested in selling the piece, I would think that he would provide pics to make sure it's actually him and for me to confirm if the piece is legit or not.  So experienced Grailed users, what would you do?"

For example, tied around the waist, it looks decent in a streetwear fit. Except for you Pharrell and your ridiculous hats.  Americana fits are always a classic go-to when wearing plaid.   Hell, I don't even know what to call this, but there's plaid and it works as part of the intended effect.  Regardless of the personal style, I think plaid is just another pattern that can be utilized correctly or incorrectly. It all depends on how you wear it, and with what you're wearing it.

TeenMFA,3706dv,TheDutchWonder,3,Sat May 23 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"Why? I personally may be biased, because I actually own them, but I really like sandals."
TeenMFA,3706dv,TheSickFlux,-1,Sat May 23 22:14:38 2015 UTC,"I can't explain it objectively because it's 100% just an opinion of mine. I don't think they ever look good, they're too small and skinny (to me) and look more like emptiness(to me). They're not commanding at all (to me) and give off a dubious tourist sort of vibe which isn't remotely cool or interesting (to me). Feet also just aren't nice to look at, especially for dudes.  I mean unless you're going to the beach, then sandals don't make sense, and even then just standard flip flops would be better. They can always be replaced by something that would look better to me. For you specifically, fits 3 and 4 would look a lot better to me with really any choice of plain white sneakers. Either way, I'm not /really/ commenting on anyones specific fits, I just dislike tevas/birks/chacos in general. They are gross, uninteresting, and ugly to me and they always will be."
TeenMFA,3706dv,TheDutchWonder,2,Sat May 23 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"What if I'm not going for commanding? I think they're cool personally, but it's not because they're strong or anything, because of the vibe they give off. To me they more say vacation/relaxation. And I don't really mind feet. They're not amazing to me, but they're also not nasty."
TeenMFA,3706dv,TheSickFlux,0,Sat May 23 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"yeah, that's why I didn't really aim my comment to you or anyone specifically. I'm just not a fan of ""vacation-ey"" styles is all."

TeenMFA,3706dx,Hyp3rion_,6,Sat May 23 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"so I'm gonna keep asking around about this (and hope I get an answer before next winter), but how should I wear bunny boots on a budget? I'm thinking about baggy cargo pants and a really chunky top but I don't have either and I fear it would look ridiculous if I took off the top (yaknow once I was inside and not justifiably able to wear a military grade parka or something). is there any way I can balance them out or should I just accept that they're ridiculous and wear em for function or wear em as they are?  I know I posted this in the kik but doesnt hurt if someone else sees this   and yeah I've looked at raf sterling ruby and that guy on c-t but they're a little out there for me so far and I want to know if just by nailing proportions I'll be okay  tldr how to wear bunny boots fashionably"
TeenMFA,3706dx,TheDutchWonder,2,Sat May 23 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"I'd say wearing a slightly oversized tee with the cargos would look alright. Think matrimonioids. Otherwise a large hood ess sweatshirt would look cool. Give me a minute to find an example.  For baggy cargo pants, I actually have some from the gap that are ""slim fit"", but still basically straight cut. They have knee pleats to increase movement, but also they create a really cool structure. Plus they're pretty cheap. I'd recommend them.  Edit- I was thinking of this when I said the oversized sweatshirt."
TeenMFA,3706dx,Hyp3rion_,3,Sat May 23 17:52:10 2015 UTC,"thanks for the idea, I'll try that out."

TeenMFA,36rx3g,coldomatic,5,Thu May 21 18:05:30 2015 UTC,it's supposed to fit baggy and over-size like that. examples: 1 2  3 4  These are the kinda looks/ aesthetics that I'm trying to go for. That's why I disagreed with your wider pants suggestion as well.

TeenMFA,36rx3j,plaidappendix,3,Fri May 22 00:34:38 2015 UTC,Both look like they fit well. Seems like they could look good as is or with a cuff if you'd like

TeenMFA,36nb8o,duhPheg,2,Wed May 20 17:19:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see any posts showing his hair, but if you have some really long hair, this gives you a lot more styles to do. This also limits what you can do. I would actually recommend you stop using American Crew because they are (in my opinion) the ""training wheels"" of hair style products. Now, just asking what new product you should try isn't going to help much. You need to tell me what your hair type is like (wavy, thick, straight, thin, etc.), what kind of hair style you're looking for, and what you're looking for in a product (finish, hold, durability, malleability, smell, etc.)"

TeenMFA,36nb8k,YouRedditIReddit,1 point,Thu May 21 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"Fingerpicking comes easier with practice. Set a metronome to a relatively low tempo and pick 8th notes until you're feeling comfortable with the timing, and raise the tempo a bit until you're happy. One of my favorite bass lines is from It Feels Like We Only Go Backwards by Tame Impala, it's a lot of fun to play."

The whole social aspect is what makes it all the more fun. If you've ever snowboarded the whole social game is almost just like that. Like, sure, you can go on your own and have fun but it will be infinitely more fun with the squad."

Also don't go cheap on your first set up, I'm not saying go drop hundreds of dollars on a deck, but getting a cheap crappy board will make it harder to Learn to Ollie and such, which will make it harder for you to enjoy skating from the beginning. You can get a solid setup for around 100, and maybe less if you buy trucks and wheels used, but get a new board as more pop will make it easier to learn."

TeenMFA,36a1i7,Varos_Flynt,8,Sun May 17 18:14:11 2015 UTC,"by buying secondhand, i'm not supporting the retailer who paid to have the animal killed in the first place. granted, though, the only current leather items in my wardrobe are superstars and a belt (both brought from the same local thrift store), so what could be my status of ""walking leather advertisement"" is thankfully not.  not veg, though. humans eating meat at least helps for them to fulfill one of their most basic needs in a non-frivolous way, and finding good/healthy vegetarian food is often almost impossible to do, especially in a place like chicago where farmer's markets and other places for good veg meals are oftentimes too expensive and therefore more of a luxury/celebratory item, whilst other lumps of the city are massive food deserts, where the healthiest way to get your daily protein is to get a burger from the local grill joint."
TeenMFA,36a1i7,lionfire42,13,Sun May 17 18:24:31 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't buying any leather at all still support the idea that you're OK with an animal dying for clothing? Sure you're not directly supporting the fashion retailer that had the animal killed, but you are benefitting from that retailers actions.  Interesting about the Chicago food situation. I tried being vegetarian for about 6 months, and it was really quite fun, but I feel as if American cuisine is geared against a full vegetarian diet (I experienced this in France too when I visited, so maybe all western world cuisine isn't that vegan friendly)."
TeenMFA,36a1i7,Varos_Flynt,-2,Sun May 17 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"i'm only benefiting by them in name, and helping a store which puts aside a good amount of its proceeds for charitable use in the process. in a way, i'm getting the best of both worlds here. superstars are at this point (thanks adidas marketing) so mundane that my purchasing of an old, beat, secondhand pair of them isn't gonna make some kid on the streets say ""whoa, unique; i want a pair now!"""
TeenMFA,36a1i7,lionfire42,6,Sun May 17 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading this correctly, you aren't necessarily against wearing leather in principle, just against fashion retailers needlessly using/wasting leather?"
TeenMFA,36a1i7,Varos_Flynt,4,Sun May 17 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"pretty much. leather products that have already been made aren't gonna turn back into the animals that died to make them if no one wears them, so someone might as well do just that; i'm just hoping that the current trends of leather everything go away soon, and by not directly supporting the brands who cause it to be as such -- i'm speaking more on my secondhand leather belt (which i don't even wear anymore) purchase here, as adidas is far too big to solely produce leather products -- i'm doing the best i can as a consumer to make that hope a reality."
TeenMFA,36a1i7,lionfire42,-6,Sun May 17 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"God you're so fucking pretentious. The act of wearing animal skin/fur is just as old as was eating meat you fucking twat. If anything the halting of wearing leather will just make that leather go to waste. The native americans used every part of the animal and we think of them as noble and respectful of the sacrifice that the animal made, but when we do the same thing (by eating the meat and using the skin) that's somehow inhumane? Get over yourself."
TeenMFA,36a1i7,theboneandbonely,7,Sun May 17 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"before i get a chance to defend my words, i have a question of my own.  why did you make an alt account just to berate everything i say and attack me for no good reason? seems like kind of a cowardly thing to do... if you don't like me and disagree with the things i say, then don't constantly shove that disagreement down my fucking throat, because now it looks as if you're the one who needs to get over yourself."
TeenMFA,36a1i7,lionfire42,4,Sun May 17 19:49:28 2015 UTC,While I agree with your points about him following you and leaving negative comments everywhere the concept you base your argument on is quite pretentious. You mention getting a burger as a cheap food source so why would you be against buying new leather? The cow is already dead so it makes sense to use as much of it as you can.  Wouldn't you rather the whole cow be used in one way or another than have the hide left to decompose and release greenhouse gasses?
TeenMFA,36a1i7,it1r,-3,Sun May 17 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"i mentioned kids stuck in food deserts (this is key) getting a burger because it's the only source of protein readily available to them, a totally different scenario then the one i'm stuck in. as a consumer, i can choose to buy clothes that aren't made of leather because there are a ton of other, better (to me, at least) alternatives for me on the market. the same goes for someone whose (usually suburban, but not too rural) community allows for him to adhere to a healthy vegetarian diet; he can make the conscious choice not to eat meat because there are so many better alternatives on his respective market. if we both choose to make cuts to our dead animal intake in different ways, though, the cow that would have died to make my leather jacket and his burger wouldn't have to die.   if everyone was more conscious about matters like this, widespread trends would allow for what i think would happen to actually become a reality."
TeenMFA,36a1i7,lionfire42,1 point,Sun May 17 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the social situation in Chicago, could you offer some insight to what it's like?   The cows will be slaughtered and the meat will be eaten regardless of your choices. If everyone  reduced their consumption of meat there would be an excess due to the demand of leather and vice-versa.  Even if everyone simultaneously decided to reduce their consumption of leather and meat we would have a massive excess in a couple years. None of it would get used and that is just as bad as overconsumption. Also animal products are difficult to replace due to them filling an important part of the food pyramid and being a durable and accessible material used in many products."
TeenMFA,36a1i7,it1r,2,Sun May 17 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"food deserts! interesting topic...  chicago has gotten itself the reputation as one of the most racially and economically segregated cities in the us, and food deserts, ""urban neighborhoods and rural towns without ready access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food"" as the usda puts it, are a byproduct of said cultural divide. generally located on the south side of chicago and pretty much exclusive to african-american neighborhoods, they're all the same in that they offer their consumers, who in many cases are poverty-stricken already, no purchasing power at all with regards to the foods they buy and, well, consume. it's a stark contrast to someone like me who lives at home with his parents (for the next three months, at least), has a good job, and receives an income from said job that is for the most part entirely disposable, currently giving me the highest amount of fashion-related purchasing power i'll ever have in my life. for more information on why poor chicagoans eating cheap hamburgers because it's the ""healthiest"" thing they have to eat has no bearing on the argument i'm trying to make, read this (one of the few actions of chicago's current mayor i support tbh) and this.  >If everyone reduced their consumption of meat there would be an excess due to the demand of leather and vice-versa.  a bit irrelevant, as that goes against what i wish for others to do. my messages are addressed more accurately in the rest of your argument, though, so i'll forget this.  >Even if everyone simultaneously decided to reduce their consumption of leather and meat we would have a massive excess in a couple years.  no point in denying that this wouldn't happen, although the supply and demand curve would eventually even itself out. as for all the excess leather products? why, they'd all go on sale for low enough prices where the consumer will either be lured into buying them because of just that or realize that the existing leather goods are all just dead weight and that it's better to just buy them for that very sake. companies that make such goods will realize that leather isn't as much of a trending item anymore, and will thus be forced either to downsize or, hopefully, to modernize their business practices and put out a product which more consumers of the future market will value.  >Also animal products are difficult to replace due to them filling an important part of the food pyramid and being a durable and accessible material used in many products.  although they do fill a big chunk of the food pyramid (which in itself is a bit of a fake concept; everyone's metabolism is different and there's no one set amount of healthy foods to eat per day that has equally positive effects on everyone), they don't, as the growing number of vegetarians, vegans, and reducetarians (link on the latter term if you've never heard of it before) who are doing just fine proves, fill an irreplaceable part of it. as for your last matter, yes it's a given that animal products that don't get used for foods can be made into many different and useful materials such as drum hides, protective equipment, and insulators for things like jackets and vests, among other things. all of those items, however, have alternatives on the market made of synthetic materials, though, meaning that the consumption of leather isn't even required there anymore, as we as a society have moved far past that."

TeenMFA,36a08t,Varos_Flynt,2,Mon May 18 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"Cardiff, Wales"
TeenMFA,36a08t,nikolaprof,11,Mon May 18 17:23:44 2015 UTC,"When school ends, I'm planning to delete all of the social media apps (Instagram/reddit/twitter) from my phone for a month or maybe the entire summer. I think I use my phone excessively, and it takes away time from things I value more like reading, doing outdoorsy stuff, watching cool movies. It has become habitual for me to just whip out my phone during some down time and open reddit and scroll past tons of garbage essentially.  Now I'm not insinuating that insta and reddit are inherently bad, they're great, I just need to get some balance going. Plus I really want to work on improving myself over the summer, and I don't wanna trouble myself with anyone else's life during that time.  Also for anyone wondering I don't use the computer a whole lot, so its not like I'm just gonna go on there instead.  With that said, anyone see Fury Road this weekend? I think its one of the best movies I've seen, but of course I'll will be watching it again to see how it holds up."
TeenMFA,36a08t,nikolaprof,3,Sun May 17 17:58:16 2015 UTC,"I feel you man. I also think I might be spending too much time on social media. I think we should limit ourselves to about half an hour or so. Lately nobody is calling or texting me, everyone's just sending a message on fb/viber/snapchat etc. and I don't think that's good."
TeenMFA,36a08t,Varos_Flynt,7,Sun May 17 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"School is so stressful, especially in the last month or so. Here we don't have finals, but still there are quite a few of tests and teachers asking us shit.   Also went to a house party last night, drank a bit of alcohol and now I think I might need some insight from ones with more experience. What should I drink and how much?"
TeenMFA,36a08t,nikolaprof,7,Sun May 17 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not super experienced with alcohol related activities, but I do know a fair bit about when to know your limit (from various personal experiences).  Drink slowly and keep your drinking paced. Downing tons of shots at once will hit you like a load of bricks 10 minutes later, and from that point its a slippery slope down into blacking out. Just take it easily, learn your limits, and know when to say ""I've had enough, if I drink anymore I will lose control of myself."" And if you do just want to get super drunk, have a less drunk friend with you so you don't get to the point of throwing up over your carpet and requiring a stomach pump. Also don't drink on an empty stomach, and keep snacking while your drinking."
TeenMFA,36a08t,Varos_Flynt,2,Sun May 17 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this, I think you summed it up pretty well. Any suggestions on what to drink? What's your favorite?"
TeenMFA,36a08t,Synthbells,6,Sun May 17 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"I've had experience with the main (only?) groups of alcohol: beer, wine, hard liquor. Beer is okay, I've heard people describe it as drinking bread Lol. Its really high in calories and doesn't get me that tipsy, so I'm not a huge fan, but I'm fond of shock top.  Wine and champagne are my favorites. Living in wine country USA, I've gotten to taste a wide variety of wines, and there's not one I don't like. Wine has an alcohol content between liquor and beer (9-17% usually) so two to three glasses is enough for me to get relatively tipsy. Wine usually taste some form of fruity or at least flavorful in some way, but it can get pretty bitter at times. Don't buy bottom shelf wine, but anything above that is good.  Liquor tastes like shit, but has a high alcohol content (normally 40%). This is why people will do any variety of things to flavor their vodka or tequila. It personally makes me gag, but its a one way ticket to getting drunk fast so sometimes you just have to force it down. I really like making drinks with liquor, more as an art form than anything.  Of course there are subsets of each category, and there's a variety of combinations out there, so I recommend just trying everything and see what you like. Don't be afraid to experiment! Also look up drink making guides on YouTube, their really entertaining and there's some crazy things to try."
TeenMFA,36a08t,depression1017,1 point,Sun May 17 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"Cider is cool; Cheap wine will hit you so much harder than you think, Spirits obviously will too. Beer is kinda bitter/not my thing (YMMV) and pre-made mixers (think anything bright coloured) are generally pretty expensive but a good compromise of taste/alcoholic content (similar to cider)."

TeenMFA,36a08t,-Clarkasaurus-,5,Mon May 18 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"Like Varos said, it's all about the pacing. If you're drinking ""smart"" drink slow and over the course of the night. If you're reaching the point where you're starting to stumble a ton, slow down, drink water.  Drink lots of water and moreover, never drink alone. Have someone with you to kinda keep an eye on you and keep an eye on them. Drinking responsibly is kiiind of an oxymoron so a buddy is really helpful for keeping a watchful eye.   Going along with what Varos said, shots are the express lane to being blackout fucking drunk. Be careful with 'em, and always drink in a safe place with people watching over you."
TeenMFA,36a08t,jegbyrd,5,Sun May 17 18:45:59 2015 UTC,Drinks I like a lot: -Screwdrivers: orange juice and vodka -Crown and coke: Crown Royal and coke -Dirty water: Rum and lemonade  Stay away from gin for now.
TeenMFA,36a08t,Cryptic_Spooning,3,Mon May 18 00:54:29 2015 UTC,Don't get trashed. Nobody likes the annoying trashed kid who goes around super fucked up after drinking two shots.  Just stick to wine and beer.  Drinking is no longer fun once you're past tipsy. When you're tipsy you can enjoy yourself and still have the feeling you are trying to obtain. Once you're past tipsy you just make mistakes and act a fool.
TeenMFA,36a08t,Vuzuro,3,Sun May 17 22:28:43 2015 UTC,Don't drink so much that you lose complete control of yourself. I say drink until you free up some of your inhibitions then chill out.

With the drinking though it's just a matter of learning, in this learning process you will have at least one night when you're bent over spewing all night surrounded by friends who are a bit pissed off at you for ruining their night. But if you do it right, you will only have one of those nights and then never go above your limits again."

TeenMFA,36a08t,argewfhowefh,2,Sun May 17 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"I was kind of conflicted over whether or not to buy.

I also just bought a pair of these orange air maxes, but I may go back tomorrow and get the vans and then return whatever I don't like when the air maxes come in."
TeenMFA,36a08t,not_Brendan,2,Sun May 17 21:29:27 2015 UTC,"while they might be the same color, vans fill a very different role in ur wardrobe compred to those nike frees. a shoe as versatile as vans authentic gumsoles cant do harm  besides, 20 dollars is super cheap (imo, dont know about ur financial situation tho)."

TeenMFA,368oun,hellayeezus,21,Sun May 17 06:24:41 2015 UTC,"Over the summer, before I started college, I realized it was a good time to stop letting my mom dress me LOL. I went with girls to go shopping for clothes over the summer. But I soon learned that just because they're girls, it doesn't necessarily mean they know how to dress guys (even if they dress well themselves). The clothes they picked out, I ended up never wearing again today :(. But my fashion transformation mostly started in college, because of a friend I met. I was buying a calculator online from Amazon, and she previously mentioned this cologne that smelled great on guys, and that chicks kinda dig guys that smell nice lmao. I was like, what the heck, I'll add it in my amazon cart as I was buying my calculator. The cologne arrived and it turned out to be pretty good, since I got casually complimented by people. Shortly after, I saw on /r/bestof about some guy posting about a list of good cologne (idk if I still have the link). I didn't end up buying more colognes, but the post was pretty cool. I remembered that mfa existed from the post, but I never really looked through mfa previously. I was bored and checked out the subreddit again, and figured maybe I'll try to dress better and impress girls. There was WAYWT post, and I decided to looked through it. I ended up seeing some pretty cool fits that I wanted to try myself, and the list of brands helped. Anyways, that was pretty much my fashion journey, and I learned to dress for myself mostly now. Fk girls.  tl;dr: Did it to impress girls."

TeenMFA,368oun,oldhaggus2,8,Sun May 17 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I'm a bit late to the party, just stumbled into this sub last night.  For me personally, I started to dress myself better after my then girlfriend dumped my ass. At that point I started looking at clothes differently. They weren't just fabric, they were an extension of my personality. Now, I have a rather conservative personality, so I enjoy a good fit and layering. That was over a year ago now, and I haven't looked back. Learning how to tie a half Windsor, or polish a pair of shoes can take you from just a teenager who throws on a suit to a young adult who looks great.  Just my $0.02 and my experience. Hope everyone has a good day."

TeenMFA,368oun,Kawaii-As-Fuck,7,Sun May 17 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"There's something about dressing nicely that makes you (or me, at least) feel a little bit more confident, a little bit more on top of things. When you dress like a slob, you might be more inclined to act like a slob. When you move toward suiting up, Stinson style, you move toward acting like a man who's in control."

TeenMFA,368oun,radioactivify,4,Mon May 18 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"when i got into /fa/ like 4-5 years ago i started coping what they wore, which was all basically menswear stuff. at the time there were very very little sz members on there posting rick, ann d, bbs, ccp, etc., and i was like ""yo damn what is that, thats so cool but i know ill never actually be able to buy that shit.""  a bit later i started making essentially knockoffs of what i saw online (shredded shirts, drop crotch, layering tanks, cropped pants, etc), and i put my own little stuff that i enjoy along with it. i was able to mess around really easily with this style without jumping too deep into it because i thrifted most of my shit, so i literally pay like $4 for my shirts and pants and stuff so i dont feel bad cutting the fuck out of some, even if the end result is 'bad'.  after that (basically now) im like yo i need to stop copying exact looks and just wear everything i like that can be coherently put together (minimal shit, streetwear shit, experimental cuts and deisgns).   and then that makes how i dress now. its a bit long but i decided to ramble"
TeenMFA,368oun,matrimonioids,9,Mon May 18 16:06:06 2015 UTC,"I was always pretty particular about my appearance (I've been doing stuff with my hair for years, for example). It's just how I'm wired. I had been browsing MFA for quite awhile, always thinking ""wow, this is really cool. I should try getting into fashion"" but I never really started out of laziness or something. I just finally made the decision to start early this year for some reason, and like most people starting out in fashion, I made a lot of mistakes. I probably am still making a lot of mistakes but I like to think I'm getting better."

TeenMFA,368oun,KanyeDeOuest,3,Mon May 18 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"Well I am super late to the game. Sorry for that, but I started to begin to take an interest in fashion last summer. I had my friend over and he showed me tmfa. I started looking at the WYWT threads and really loved them. I loved seeing the various fits and what I could do to improve my sense of style. I had always loved clothing I just never made an effort to really change and get into it. This pushed me to start changing my fashion game and really get involved. I started going online and buying clothing from the sites that were recommended. I was given a lot of shit this year for pin rolling my jeans and cuffing my sleeves. But even though there are the fair share of haters at my school there are also people who started to respect me more because I told them that I felt that if I wore what made me feel good I would feel good about myself. I inspired some people since then to change what they wear and check out tmfa for advice. I think I also did this to attract more girls because I never really had a lot of confidence and this really boosted my own self confidence."

TeenMFA,366j1s,MickePB,0,Sun May 17 23:02:50 2015 UTC,Maybe because you just posted your own opinion with no regard for what op might prefer//like.
TeenMFA,366j1s,jegbyrd,5,Sun May 17 23:15:34 2015 UTC,I pointed out what I thought would be a better shirt in the fit.  Then I said I don't think it benefits the fit.  Isn't this entire subreddit all about peoples different opinions? I don't see how anything here could be a fact if it's a comment on ones fit.
TeenMFA,366j1s,MickePB,0,Sun May 17 08:20:45 2015 UTC,"The thing is that (as I said) the person posting the fit might have different preferences, so when giving advice at least try to look at what can be changed from the posters perspective and not just from yours (that could be Style or you might know his/her preferences a bit etc)"
TeenMFA,366j1s,jegbyrd,3,Sun May 17 08:22:16 2015 UTC,"He clearly picked a white shirt here so a white t is what he was going for. So I just suggested taking the graphic off it and making it a plain t. It seems like it is still following the guideline of what he was trying to obtain.  What i'm getting at is I wasn't trying to offend his outfit, I just felt it could be strengthened with a minor change."

It falls a solid inch above my knee at least and the material is really nice. Just wish they had more color variation. I have a few pairs of jcrew Stantons in my room right now with the tags still on, can't decide between keeping the 9 inches or going with the 10.5 and getting them tailored to be an inch shorter which would probably be ideal length.  Also if anyone has shorts inspo albums that'd be great because since I'm not some quadzilla I have trouble with shorts looking good I think."

It just personally looks weird to me when your shorts are practically the same length as shorts you would wear to a track meet. Also I don't think shorts always have to be real short, IMO most fits with shorts look fine when they're, say, a couple inches above the knee.  I'm pretty short and 9-inch inseams are in the right spot where I can cuff them once to get about the perfect length, or leave them un-cuffed when it's like a lazy school day or something and I just feel like longer shorts.  Also it's the struggle to have skinny legs because it feels like every pair is too wide (inb4 don't skip leg day comments)"

TeenMFA,35ukv4,matrimonioids,1 point,Thu May 14 08:20:30 2015 UTC,"honestly depends what kind of look youre going for. to be honest i feel as if digital is better for some things, especially taken in the price of film.   My general rule is I get probably 5 good shots in every 100 shots. So you might be around the same, and if thats cool with you, then yeah man shooting film is a lot of fun, and the look is real nice with it. I might link an album I did with some Ektar 100... its not too great but its p cool."
TeenMFA,35ukv4,676339784,1 point,Thu May 14 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"I see. About the low yield, is it possible to raise the proportion of good shots with practice?"
TeenMFA,35ukv4,matrimonioids,2,Thu May 14 12:57:30 2015 UTC,"I guess so depending on how often you shoot, where youre at, everything else. I want to assume the better you get the more good shots you get, but i dont know."

The rectangle part is exactly how I envision it 2.  It's just wearing looser, albeit not extremely flowey garments.   Slim pants would work here just as well, but it would change the look slightly, not in a bad way, just in a way that's not for me  Hope that answered it it's not the easiest thing to put in words sometimes Beyond ""I just like it"" so I did my best"

TeenMFA,35qbmz,plebdestrian,3,Tue May 12 21:53:28 2015 UTC,For me the band on the second makes it more casual and can go with anything. While the first seems more formal like suit or blazer type fit.
TeenMFA,35qbmz,largestick,2,Wed May 13 01:18:26 2015 UTC,personally I like the timex weekender more-it's a more casual look whereas the stainless steel one is better suited for a suit. I might be wrong though.
TeenMFA,35qbmz,blanket_log,2,Wed May 13 04:56:09 2015 UTC,"It's mostly preference. both are casual watches and neither should really be worn to actual formal stuff if you want to Stick to the Rules.  The nylon strap is called a NATO strap (but it was used by the british military first) - tends to be associated with diving, the military and people who shop at jcrew. Metal bracelets are not as strictly casual as NATO straps but they're not Formal by any means. i think they were originally used in sports watches/ were probably popularised by rolex."

TeenMFA,35mwfw,lionfire42,11,Mon May 11 23:23:22 2015 UTC,"what is your style philosophy? as in do u believe in a goal for fashion- to feel good about oneself, to express oneself, to have fun, to show off, etc? i've seen your fits and the often varied reactions, i admire you for doing your own thing :-)  also, how do you reconcile ethics with fashion? on one hand, i do eventually want to become a vegetarian and stop using animal products, but on the other hand, meat, leather, etc  are so ubiquitous and useful. it feels like i cant make much of a difference so i might as well continue, and im not even sure if its worth it, as callous as that may sound.   thanks for doing this!!!"
TeenMFA,35mwfw,juvenalien,15,Mon May 11 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"I'll deffo answer this one.   My style philosophy is to follow my tastes. If you always are the same old ingredients in a bunch of different ways you would probably be fine - but when you try new tastes you realise there are other things you LOVE that you never knew existed. I probably dressed way more out there when I was a teenager but if I hadn't I would never have been able to refine my style. Now I know what I like but I'm open to trying new things.   In terms of ethics I've had this discussion a bajillion times. If you really want to stop wearing things that are cruel you can. It's seriously not that hard to just be like ""I do not think its cool that something had to die for this meal/pair of shoes/shitty wallet"". People say that when you stop eating meat and start eating good plant based food you feel better (you do) - and I can attest to the fact that the same goes for clothing."

Whats your r&d fabric process like at STORY? I've read the whole thread on that other forum but would like a more in depth answer.   Related, I am very into STORY and would love to support the brand but I don't dress enough like heckawheel to wear most of the clothes in an expressive way. Is there a possibility of STORY ever selling the fabric patches you ship out with the clothes? Maybe at the slowmade studio (which I plan on visiting in early July. Do I have to contact you about that or is it open to the public?)  Lastly I'm having difficulty making a pleasing pattern (working on some cropped trousers.), how does the pattern making and proportion get done at STORY?

Obviously the interesting part of this fit is how the supreme shirt plays with the long sleeve, which individually is actually pretty cool. i think some black jeans might help that to work better.  edit: if people wanna add their own input instead of downvoting mine that'd be pretty chill"
TeenMFA,35eqzb,Thissquirrelisonfire,2,Sat May 9 17:40:46 2015 UTC,Light wash or black jeans in the first one would improve it a bunch in my opinion. Also maybe chunkier shoes OR less loose fitting jeans

TeenMFA,35714l,hizzopothamus,2,Thu May 7 17:33:52 2015 UTC,Anything in particular that you put in it? After a shower I can style my hair however the hell I want with a spot of wax but I can't for the life of me keep it up throughout the day unless I blast it with a hairdryer. Pomade? Heavy Gel? Idk what would help
TeenMFA,35714l,Shizzable,8,Thu May 7 17:39:30 2015 UTC,"Blowdrying is the best thing you can do. It doesn't show, but my hair is super thick and puffy and I've always had problems with keeping the front where I want it to be. I'm getting better at it, but it's still hard to do.  Right now what I do is add sea salt spray to damp hair, crunch it with my hands to give it a nice texture, then when it's just damp again I add a bit of Hanz de Fuko Claymation and blowdry while messing my hair around and using a brush at the end. If I need to I can then add a bit more Claymation afterwords to clean it up. My end goal is a sort of messed-up beach-y look but I'm struggling to get there."
TeenMFA,35714l,hizzopothamus,2,Thu May 7 18:09:13 2015 UTC,How good actually is the claymation? Heard a bunch of good things about it but still kinda iffy on spending like 20 quid on something like that

TeenMFA,35714l,AidanSN,1 point,Thu May 7 21:38:37 2015 UTC,I almost feel like a size up on your shirt would look better. The slimness of it seems to make your whole top half look kind of small compared to the bottom half because of the shorts with the large cuffs.  Edit: or I think shorter shorts would work well too

Then my grandmother got a hold of them and bleached them to shit in the worst way possible. They almost looked like bleach tie-dye, but in a shitty way. After about a year of them sitting in the closet doing nothing, I bleached them more evenly and cut them off. Voilà."

My mom wouldn't let me do it in the tub, so I had to fold them up a couple times in a bucket. A lot of people will tell you to use a 1/15 or so ratio of bleach to water for several hours, but I got away with 1/5 or so for an hour and a half. I immediately washed them by themselves afterward."

TeenMFA,35714l,lowkeyabedframe,5,Thu May 7 21:49:52 2015 UTC,Ties generally should not be worn without a dress shirt unless it is a casual tie ie knit. The tie is tied well it is just a couple inches too long. The shirt fits pretty good but its just a little too formal for thosekhakis I think. I think you could make a dope fit with a lighter pair of chinos instead of heavy (american eagle?) khakis.

TeenMFA,35714l,heck3,14,Fri May 8 03:57:22 2015 UTC,"ok actual criticism time here  not feeling the tuck, why did you do the tuck? what was your intentions with this enitre fit  stop standing with ur feet together please it messes up the fit!!  the tie knot is far too big for the shirt it looks ridiculous smaller tie knot is needed in future.   bottom half is better than top atm."
TeenMFA,35714l,ZachE1996,7,Thu May 7 17:28:02 2015 UTC,p much the whole basis around this fit tbh was that my date wanted to match shoes so I wore what I would normally wear with a suit and wore superstars instead of dress shoes
TeenMFA,35714l,Vuzuro,29,Thu May 7 20:31:01 2015 UTC,"Not digging the superstars at all, it screams of trying to be edgy"
TeenMFA,35714l,lionfire42,12,Thu May 7 20:52:51 2015 UTC,Why do you say that?
TeenMFA,35714l,Vuzuro,34,Thu May 7 18:29:25 2015 UTC,"Because it's just a standard suit, and wearing sneakers, especially ones as casual and gaudy as superstars completely goes against the conventions of traditional suit footwear. It seems like just going against a convention purely to 'be different'.   Breaking the rules of fashion is what moves it forward, but I don't think this breaks the rules well at all."
TeenMFA,35714l,ZachE1996,5,Thu May 7 20:03:55 2015 UTC,r superstars rlly that gaudy lol  but i do agree that this would b cooler with a not so standard suit

TeenMFA,35714l,Vuzuro,12,Thu May 7 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I don't think is that done very well. And a prom isn't typically a 'casual suiting' environment."
TeenMFA,35714l,lionfire42,5,Thu May 7 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"Prom isn't typically anything...   When Zach wore this, he was probably thinking ""If anyone here actually has a problem with my shoes then they're probably not someone I want to be around"""
TeenMFA,35714l,dindonfootball,3,Thu May 7 20:34:13 2015 UTC,The fact that it's #prom doesn't mean you can't have any fun with it or express personal style.
TeenMFA,35714l,Varos_Flynt,2,Thu May 7 22:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that this is prom is what makes it work well most in its context. The proms I'm familiar with, most kids wear dress shirts and pants along with converse and showy suspenders. His outfit fits in that context while also executing a specific look very well, imo"

TeenMFA,35714o,ec34ws2,3,Thu May 7 21:58:51 2015 UTC,"So, for various reasons, I don't really have the desire to acquire a huge shoe collection. I find it difficult to justify owning more than 3-4 pairs of (regular, everyday) shoes max. I recently purged my clothes, and purged my shoes as well. I had 2 pairs of everyday shoes, a pair of trainers, and a pair of dress shoes; and with the exception of the dress shoes, got rid everything else. I just recently bought a pair of grey vans with a cool design inside, and am trying to figure out what other pair of shoes I should get. If you had a pair of grey vans, and could only have one more pair of shoes, what shoes would you own?  TL; DR  - If you could only own 2 pairs of (everyday) shoes, and one of them was a pair of grey vans, what other pair of shoes would you own?"
TeenMFA,35714o,argewfhowefh,5,Thu May 7 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"depends on your style. what do u feel u need? chunky or slim? color? high or low?   i mean i could just say stan smiths cuz those are versatile, but i feel like ur better off getting something which actually fits your style perfectly rather than a shoe which goes 'ok' with everything."
TeenMFA,35714o,ec34ws2,3,Thu May 7 18:38:20 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks. Yeah, I understand the whole getting shoes to fit your style thing. Makes sense. At the moment, I guess I would describe my 'style' as just really basic, neutral, and subdued. I know everyone has preferences, but I was just looking for a very simple, basic, versatile shoe."
TeenMFA,35714o,argewfhowefh,4,Thu May 7 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"i'd say stans then. they work in many styles, so if ur moving on to something more 'interesting' later the stans would be fine, but they're also totally cool with basic fits.  they're also leather so they work for the winter unlike the vans."
TeenMFA,35714o,slumdog_mignolet,2,Thu May 7 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"what type of vans  and yeah pretty much what has been said - it all depends on ur personal style tbh, though there are plenty of versatile options out there."

TeenMFA,35714o,Sp3ctr3,2,Thu May 7 21:35:36 2015 UTC,"I do love my Stan Smiths, even though they've seen better days. After a year the leather just really isn't the same, but it's still goes with basically everything. They're simple, but also stand out with the ""fairway green"" color. However, I do really love my new pair of Comme des Garcons Play Converse, they're just outstanding and really go with my style. Like /u/argewfhowefh said, it really depends on your style."
TeenMFA,35714o,ec34ws2,3,Thu May 7 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess the problem is I'm still trying to find my 'style'. I guess, at the moment, I would describe it as basic and subdued. I was just kind of looking for a neutral, basic shoe (am aware how ridiculously vague that is)."
TeenMFA,35714o,argewfhowefh,5,Thu May 7 21:24:10 2015 UTC,"sperry's aren't versatile at all.   they don't work for the winter and don't look good with jeans. they can also only be worn in preppy fits. assuming he'll own 2 pairs only, sperry's are a pretty crappy choice.   rod lavers are cool though."

TeenMFA,35714o,avianca1973,3,Thu May 7 23:33:47 2015 UTC,"well color isn't an issue, so wear them anywhere they're not too casual. Any kind of good graphic tee, with any color khakis/dark or light wash jeans/linen pants/shorts could look good to start. Also look into camp shorts. Oxfords or other casual shirts I can also see working decently well. Neutral colors or pastel colors would be good starting points for colors spring and summer. I'm sure I haven't covered every option you have but hopefully this is something to start with."

I don't really have that much money, I'm not looking for things that will last forever, and there stuff fits me well. I still love J. Crew, when I can afford it. There stuff usually lasts me longer and is better fitting, but the price really limits me to buying only during sales. Very rarely do I go to Urban Outfitters or H&M, it's usually if I'm just browsing and find something I've been looking at on sale. I've always had a good amount of luck with thrift stores if you've got any near you. I'd suggest just checking them out, really can't hurt.  On the flip side, I've never had too much luck with many of H&M's stuff. Small accessories are fine, but things like pants and tees never end up lasting. It might just be bad luck, but that's just my experience.  Lastly, I'd suggest checkout out Grailed.com. If you're a starving student like myself, you're probably want to going to check out their ""basic"" section for stuff more in your price range. I normally have a bit of luck with footwear and accessories on their main site, however."

TeenMFA,352u10,chpchp,9,Wed May 6 17:55:41 2015 UTC,Did you listen to the green interview where she was asked about how she'd fund her policies? She dodged the question multiple times and then just completely floundered.
TeenMFA,352u10,phattywoo,5,Wed May 6 18:02:14 2015 UTC,"the same can be said for most of the parties unfortunately, it's the same with the tories.  but yeah, I don't want Green to lead, don't get me wrong. I probably should have specified that earlier. Ideally I'd like a Labour/Green coalition, because I think Labour are much more capable to lead the country but I want the more left wing policies of the Greens to be heard"
TeenMFA,352u10,chpchp,3,Wed May 6 17:24:04 2015 UTC,I actually agree with you for the most part. I just have some reservations about miliband as a leader.

TeenMFA,352u10,phattywoo,2,Wed May 6 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"Can I ask who you would/are going to vote for? I'm not gonna be 18 in time anyway, so no need to worry about a ""wasted vote"" or w/e.   Yeah the funding is very unlikely, but then again I would vote for the party that best represent what I think, so why would I bother voting for a party I don't agree with? Everyone knows Greens won't get a winning vote anyway, I just want to see left wing policies become more popular and the only way to do that is to make the parties that support left wing policies more popular."
TeenMFA,352u10,Widgeet,3,Thu May 7 02:21:29 2015 UTC,"I personally would vote for Labour,I feel conservative run the country stronger than labour however I think leaving the EU would be disastrous for our Country and  considering UKIP's surge I am very worried about the promised referendum by the conservatives.  However aslong as the referendum failed I would be fine seeing the tories back in power. They have recently achieved strong growth levels and unemployment on the decline. While they have been a bit lucky with global factors like falling oil and food prices, I still feel they have overall done a decent job in running the country.  eh I can kinda see what you're saying there, I just have a huge problem with the Green Party funding, hopefully they can refine this to better suit their appealing ideologies."
TeenMFA,352u10,phattywoo,2,Wed May 6 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really don't think leaving the EU would benefit us either. Also I've seen too many statistics to persuade me against voting conservative honestly, and I'm thouroughly against further privatisation of the NHS.   I think the Greens have briefly mentioned that some of their funding would come from a new tax on the richest 1%, but that definitely doesn't seem like it'll be enough for the new proposals. Yeah, me too."
TeenMFA,352u10,Widgeet,1 point,Wed May 6 21:48:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean there's downsides everywhere haha, I do really struggle with knowing whether to just give up with it all xD  Yeah they have elaborated on some of their policies to do with funding however they are a little weak. In their Manifesto they claim they'll gain ~£30 billion pounds more by cutting down on tax evasion, but how they can possibly expect they'll just be able to gut it out, I have no idea."

TeenMFA,352u10,depression1017,2,Wed May 6 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"i exaggerated in my original comment i must admit. its definitely true that ukip do have some good parties but they also ahve many that i personally disagree with (leaving the EU is a huge one), fracking support and immigration. its also funny how they want to leave the EU to 'save money' but also want to keep trident; something completely and ridiculously unnecessary. im completely for some of them ie the promotion of more grammar schools, etc, and i feel like if it werent for the whole EU problem id feel like they were definitely a party that are a lot more credible and one that i would probably consider voting for more.   however there are certain parts of ukip that i and a few others will never get over; firstly its stigma. there is an undeniable knee jerk reaction to hearing ukips name and immediately associating it with nigel farage's fish face and the complete joke of a person hes recently become; furthermore, a LOT more bad than good springs to mind about UKIP. over the last few years UKIP has been seen as simply a ""racist party"". i appreciate that this isnt about the policies as such but its also reason to not vote for them... but i really have no desire to live in a country where farage is PM. the support that they already have is bad enough   id also like to know whats so backwards about the greens. i admit that they are honestly flawed and its hard to ignore the absolute flounder of avoiding the questions about how to make money for all their grand schemes, but they definitely do not have as many policies that would be detrimental to the UK as ukip do..."

TeenMFA,34ztwu,TheDutchWonder,2,Wed May 6 03:24:52 2015 UTC,"I suggest a parka, sweaters/sweatshirts, and flannels for tops. They'll keep you warm in the cold months. As far as shoes go, a good pair of boots are your best bet. If you don't like boots as much, I hear sk8 his are pretty warm"
TeenMFA,34ztwu,_mildude,4,Wed May 6 03:33:47 2015 UTC,I don't think they are personally. The sole is pretty thin and even with decently thick wool socks my feet get really cold below like 40.

TeenMFA,34ztwu,TheDutchWonder,2,Wed May 6 05:28:20 2015 UTC,"Sweaters and sweatshirts 100%. Id say get one cream thick sweater, one navy medium thickness sweater, and one grey crewneck sweatshirt. Then you can branch out and get patterned ones and different colors. Also you might want a few flannels. Maybe a blackwatch one and a buffalo check one. As far as pants go, I suggest buying some thicker (maybe raw) denim, some black denim, and possibly flannel lined chinos depending how cold the winter gets there. Also if theres lots of snow, I recommend either doc marten boots or Chippewa boots. They're cheap enough to buy and switch out for different shoes later if your style changes, but still look good (and are pretty high quality). As for a coat, a parka or Anorak will look good, and you can get those for many price points.  Hope I helped!  PS- if the winter is real bad there, thermal and henley shirts are fantastic for layering."
TeenMFA,34ztwu,PM_ME_HOT_GINGERS,2,Thu May 7 02:17:09 2015 UTC,Made the Move from MD to ND. I can tell you that its cold as fuck in the winter but you get used to it quickly.   I even see people (HS) wearing shorts when its literally 5 degrees outside.

TeenMFA,34ztwu,titaniumwings,2,Wed May 6 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"I'll do a quick Boston one here, if you are from around here feel free to add on. If people like this, I can write more.   As you may or may not know, winters in Boston are something to fear. This year, Boston had a record amount of snow and multiple storms that dumped over a foot of snow each on the city. You're definitely going to need a pair of snow boots, or shoes that you can wear in the snow. I personally used a combination of some timberland classic boots and 90s style reebok basketball shoes, which kept the snow out well. A few pairs of wool socks are a must, especially when the temperature can drop below 5 f. Kirkland merino socks are good, but if you can't get those, most tj max or marshalls around wherever you are will have them. To answer your original question about warm pants, people (or at least me) do wear long johns or thermal running tights under their pants or will just wear snow pants, which can be purchased for about $50 (I think) at a sporting goods store, online or maybe tj max/marshalls. you should also buy snow sport style gloves or mittens at these stores.   Upper body: layer up and wear a shell. I used a loose raincoat as a shell, which can be worn in basically all season depending on what is worn underneath. You can also buy a Patagonia/north face/Canada goose parka or whatever if you want. Layering might look like a thermal long sleeve shirt under a flannel with a down vest or fleece over that and a shell over that. Make sure to have at least a beanie and you should also probably have a scarf too."

The only criticism I could give for this is the shirt under the sweatshirt looks a little strange with the short shorts, I think it would look better with just the sweatshirt. However that's just a small criticism and this is awesome anyway."
TeenMFA,34yl7y,depression1017,9,Tue May 5 18:09:26 2015 UTC,"definitely, the shirt adds a lil too much formality that pink short shorts contrast"
TeenMFA,34yl7y,slumdog_mignolet,5,Tue May 5 18:51:45 2015 UTC,i rlly disagree i think the formal top half and the shorts are what gives this fit such a cool vibe
TeenMFA,34yl7y,depression1017,8,Tue May 5 18:57:01 2015 UTC,would be chiller with just the sweatshirt imo

If you don't mind talking to her in person that would be the best option:   a) It shows that you actually care enough about her to have real conversation with her.  b) You can pick up clues on how she behaves near you.  c) You minimizes the chances of a boy's worst nightmare ""seen 12:30am"" but no reply.   Tips for conversations:  You follow her tumblr and instagram it should be a piece of cake to find something that interests her that you might know a little about. Try to make her talk about herself and if she doesnt like that try some her interests. This way you make sure that you dont come off as a selfloving dipshit that only talks about himself. Obviously you don't want to come off as a stalker so don't be too specific about the interests.   Im just gonna asume that you are American and have a driver's license since like every American teenager has that, so you could just try to ask out on a date to like restuarant or something like that, a place where you get to know each other.

I shower at night, but in the morning I re-wet my hair (to reset the shape so its not matted down) and then I towel dry it until its lightly damp then I blow dry it. I start drying it opposite of the direction I want it then blow it in the direction of my hair. That's the most important part to getting volume. Then I evenly spread American Crew Fiber in my hair, but depending on length, I recommend a stronger product. Im just using up what I have left."

TeenMFA,34mzjd,KanyeDeOuest,9,Sun May 3 03:21:14 2015 UTC,They are all very different shoes that work for different styles  The only thing they have in common is that they are $$$ and Internet-cool. These are not good reasons for buying shoes.  What sort of aesthetic do you like? What sort of vibe do you want to make with your clothes? Which shoes would work best with the looks you want to achieve?  This is really something you have to answer for yourself  There's no need to hurry to buy shoes. take your time and experiment more with fashion and clothes and ~your personal style~ if you need to
TeenMFA,34mzjd,anaerobicbacteria,1 point,Sun May 3 04:13:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly the FBTs and Racers are options there as I've just really liked the designs since I saw them though I don't really have the right aesthetic and style going right now to compliment them. So I guess the other pairs are more realistic for what I should cop, and what I want to. As far as my style, I guess I try to dress more streetwear grunge (bombers, flannels, ripped jeans, tall tees) more than anything and the SLs and Tiscis would both fit into that category fairly well, so I guess I was just wondering if anyone had other options in that category."

TeenMFA,34ig7z,lionfire42,2,Fri May 1 14:06:43 2015 UTC,where u going
TeenMFA,34ig7z,theboneandbonely,4,Sat May 2 00:06:24 2015 UTC,kalamazoo  hefty scholarship and only two hours away from chicago so i'll still be able to come back on weekends
TeenMFA,34ig7z,lionfire42,-12,Sat May 2 03:12:40 2015 UTC,that's the one with a 70% acceptance rate right? yikes...
TeenMFA,34ig7z,theboneandbonely,8,Sun May 3 02:56:24 2015 UTC,"high acceptance rates don't mean shit about the actual college...  in fact, i chose the school for a plethora of reasons, for these reasons made it more attractive to me than some of the other, ""better"" as you would have it schools were in my eyes.   excellent study abroad program  small, liberal arts college with a swim team that'll let me join (and a far better one than some of the other schools i looked at) + the opportunity to start club water polo the most flexible curriculum out of any of the schools i'd looked at, so i can actually study things i want to study instead of being forced to take some math class which has almost no application to what i plan on doing after i graduate   moral of the story? don't judge a school by its acceptance rates, it doesn't mean that the kids are ""dumber"" by any means but instead that either not a lot of kids applied or accepted their offers (which is perfectly ok, kalamazoo in particular makes the mistake of focusing heavily on pushing kids from warm places like cali and fl to apply, kids who usually reject the offers once they come up to visit and find out how shit the weather is), which isn't inherently a bad thing."
TeenMFA,34ig7z,lionfire42,-6,Sun May 3 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"yeah but it says a whole lot about the student(s). I could find everything you just said except for the waterpolo thing at another school with a more prestigious reputation. The school you go to will affect the job you get. Nobody's gonna hire some kid from kalamazoo when there's a line out the lobby of people from Ivys or, well anywhere else.   EDIT: I might be a prick (astute observation Amateur_American) but that doesn't make me wrong. It certainly doesn't change anything about lionfire's school"
TeenMFA,34ig7z,theboneandbonely,5,Sun May 3 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"lol if anyone actually pulls that ""you're not an ivy kid, so you didn't get the job"" shit on me in the real world (which they won't) then i'll just refer to my above comment as to why i picked the college i picked"
TeenMFA,34ig7z,lionfire42,-4,Sun May 3 03:35:15 2015 UTC,"hahaha well keep telling yourself that your three reasons can't be applied to literally any school.It'll make the next four years of your life seem a little less pointless. I feel bad for you, you obviously have unrealistic expectations of the job market if you think that you're at the same level or better than the people who went to the schools that are difficult to get in, or that your school won't be factored in. You think they don't have reasons either? you think that they just go to a school because it has a good name? They probably put 10x as much thought into which school because they probably got accepted into 10x as many schools. good fucking luck with that."
TeenMFA,34ig7z,theboneandbonely,7,Sun May 3 03:42:29 2015 UTC,it's sad that you have nothing better to do than berate me because my college choice isn't up to snuff with your misguided standards.  live and let live

TeenMFA,34ig7z,theboneandbonely,4,Sun May 3 16:43:46 2015 UTC,what does it say about them? i'd love to know what you think
TeenMFA,34ig7z,Amateur_American,-6,Sun May 3 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"sigh, if you really want to know. It says that they aren't hard workers, that they aren't ambitious. They're the type of kids to sleep through class, take all the easy courses, and just float by on their sport of choice into a college with low enough standards and low enough prices. A college close enough to home that they won't have to go too far out of their comfort zone.  (http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/2jy31l/hello_im_lionfire42_and_im_your_daddy_now/)"

TeenMFA,34ig7z,theboneandbonely,5,Sun May 3 03:46:02 2015 UTC,"also, your idea of ""low enough prices"" being a bad thing is ludicrous, not everyone has the luxury of completely factoring out the relative cost of each college when making their final decision"
TeenMFA,34ig7z,mc-lunar,2,Sun May 3 03:55:41 2015 UTC,that's actually a good point. I'm certainly not financially privileged either so it's not cool of me to judge others based on what they can afford.

Although my biggest problem with it was that it felt sort of half done. Most of the songs were fairly short and didn't feel that finished and one quarter of the album was the long (but beautiful) drone section at the start. Still a good album but I guess I wanted more.

I recommend it as a start because one, it's still a paying job none the less. two, your future jobs wont really seem as bad when you remember dishwashing and finally working a tough job is a good way to manage money more because remembering how hard you worked for it will open your eyes to the true value of money.

TeenMFA,34gnai,AngryNavySeal,4,Fri May 1 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, if you live in the U.S. Or Canada you always need either Red Cross ""assistant life guard"" and ""life guard courses"" usually 200$ each including the manual, or you need lifesaving society "" bronze medallion,"" ""bronze cross"" and ""national lifeguard award"" usually also 200$ each. You also need to have Red Cross cpr/aed ""c"" or the equivalent. This is all to be a lifeguard.   To be a swim instructor, the common course to be required is Red Cross ""assistant water safety instructor"" and ""water safety instructor"" courses. These are usually each 150$.   This is all my lifeguard experience in Canada, I know the U.S. Requires this also almost everywhere. Basically, I think OP is grossly incorrect."
TeenMFA,34gnai,_mildude,1 point,Fri May 1 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"I live in the U.S. and took a course a few weeks ago for $250 that included bloodborne pathogen training, administering emergency oxygen, and lifeguarding/first aid/cpr/aed. It was 3 days long and now I am certified in all of those things by the American Red Cross. Being a swim instructor may be different, but for lifeguarding that is all that you need."

I worked at McDonald's for a year before getting a job at a Seattle's Best and then my uni dining hall where I'm now an assistant manager.   basically, it isn't usually going to be glamorous or enjoyable work in the beginning, but always try to be moving forward.

TeenMFA,34anzm,Discover_and_Become,30,Wed Apr 29 19:47:18 2015 UTC,This sub feels dead because the mods delete everything that isn't in a recurring thread. I think we could do with being a little less strict on that tbh.
TeenMFA,34anzm,biaxialrhombus,12,Wed Apr 29 17:55:33 2015 UTC,Nah. It feels organised. We have posts everyday with a decent amount of discussion and comments but the sub isn't cluttered. It's a good system.
TeenMFA,34anzm,taylorswiftqt,6,Wed Apr 29 18:25:38 2015 UTC,nothing is worth keeping up that they don't keep up
TeenMFA,34anzm,YEEZY-SZN,9,Wed Apr 29 18:11:50 2015 UTC,simply wrong
TeenMFA,34anzm,YEEZY-SZN,10,Wed Apr 29 18:15:31 2015 UTC,yeah if you want to become /r/streetwear  random pickup posts and outfit pics and memes don't sound appealing to me.
TeenMFA,34anzm,SpicyMcNuggets,24,Wed Apr 29 18:21:32 2015 UTC,At least streetwear feels like more of a community
TeenMFA,34anzm,MasonNowa,13,Wed Apr 29 18:30:50 2015 UTC,Really? I feel like the users here are much more tight knit and able to have proper discussions with one another more than pretty much any other sub I've been on.   /r/streetwear on the other hand feels almost like /fa/ to me in that it has a few regular recognisable posters but the majority of the sub is made up of infrequent visitors with little actual conversation between them apart from listing off memes.
TeenMFA,34anzm,Rhythianne,21,Wed Apr 29 18:34:43 2015 UTC,it feels tight knit for a few select users. i think this place is a little clique-y now and probably slightly intimidating for new users.
TeenMFA,34anzm,MasonNowa,7,Wed Apr 29 18:44:05 2015 UTC,It is.
TeenMFA,34anzm,AlienComingIn,10,Thu Apr 30 05:38:38 2015 UTC,Like 20 users are tight knit. There are 100s just lurking left out
TeenMFA,34anzm,Rhythianne,10,Wed Apr 29 19:33:58 2015 UTC,"I do get what you're saying but it's true that you get out what you put in. I used to be super intimidated by a lot of posters here and felt left out, but it wasn't until I started commenting now and then, and talking a bit more on the kik chat that I realized how nice being part of a community with similar interests can be. You just gotta go for it!"
TeenMFA,34anzm,taylorswiftqt,2,Wed Apr 29 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"I feel a part of the community on many other subreddits related to my interests, this one, the smallest, I feel the most detached."
TeenMFA,34anzm,MasonNowa,7,Wed Apr 29 21:25:38 2015 UTC,Post more then
TeenMFA,34anzm,taylorswiftqt,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:42:22 2015 UTC,How come? Is it just the clique feeling you're getting?
TeenMFA,34anzm,MasonNowa,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:50:48 2015 UTC,that's dumb.  of course you're gonna be left out if you don't actively try to be a part of the community
TeenMFA,34anzm,taylorswiftqt,6,Wed Apr 29 19:41:56 2015 UTC,Okay but they are certainly plenty who contribute but are left out of the clique.
TeenMFA,34anzm,perifery,4,Wed Apr 29 19:44:48 2015 UTC,what clique?
TeenMFA,34anzm,windowflowers,4,Wed Apr 29 19:51:09 2015 UTC,Small group of members consistently in the chat and social media communicating outside of the subreddit.
TeenMFA,34anzm,taylorswiftqt,5,Wed Apr 29 20:02:32 2015 UTC,you're welcome to join any of the chats.  they're not closed or anything
TeenMFA,34anzm,lionfire42,2,Wed Apr 29 20:04:20 2015 UTC,maybe its a bit too tight-knit
TeenMFA,34anzm,lionfire42,5,Wed Apr 29 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"yeah, I've always liked loose gauge knits, so this feels a bit off to me"
TeenMFA,34anzm,lionfire42,5,Thu Apr 30 02:42:53 2015 UTC,"teenmfa is what you make it man, we have an irc chat, and a very active kik that you're welcome to join. we also occasionally go on plug.dj.  i admit it did feel that way to me when i first joined but once i started talking to other users in these chats i felt way better about it."

TeenMFA,34anzm,-H0B0-,17,Wed Apr 29 23:50:00 2015 UTC,"Agree on this position.  All those pickup and fit posts are so useless. Like, what do kids expect to get from that? They don't allow for much discussion, and, as such, are fine relegated to their own thread every Wednesday.  ""Ooh. You got a BAPE shark hoody. Cool. Uh, yeah. Woooo go you!!!""  Granted, I did post a pickup post in R streetwear the other day but that was only to get my link karma up to 420 (yup, I deleted all my links after I reached the milestone)...  To continue, if something is clearly not serious and intended as a joke (see Pro_Aus's grill cheese sandwich or all the tfw tmfa memes), I'll usually leave it up, and I'll usually delete questions posted directly to the sub a few days after they've been posted, after the questions have been answered."
TeenMFA,34anzm,gawsan,4,Wed Apr 29 18:39:38 2015 UTC,Agree with this. Having it clean and organized also allows the occasional guide or review threads rise to the top and get more attention
TeenMFA,34anzm,-H0B0-,2,Wed Apr 29 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"Yes i agree, things that get posted in general discussion get buried. There should be more freedom to post photos or threads"

TeenMFA,34anzm,twinsofliberty,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:40:21 2015 UTC,"The apple vinegar rinse is the most recommended one by nopoo people. Although I think it's mostly about trial and error and what works for your hair though, so I'll be trying some different stuff."

I've got the basics down, but I need to fill in some of the gaps.  My first question is: does anyone know a reputable tailor in the Philadelphia / Center City area?  My second and most important question is: What needs to be tailored for my suit in order for it to fit better? The dress shirt, tie, and shoes I am wearing will not be worn to this years prom. I will get into that later.  The suit. My apologies for the 15+ images but I was unsure of what people needed to see and I wanted to be as thorough as possible.  Third: How can I put together a nice ensemble of clothing and accessories in order to compliment my date's dress?  The dress.  My thoughts to go along with her dress were my charcoal grey suit, a white dress shirt, either this pocket square as a puff or a white linen square tv fold, and a black tie with some sort of simple patterning (like this tie.) I would also be buying some sort of black dress shoe. If anyone has any suggestions for shoes in the ~$75 - 125 price range that would be great."

TeenMFA,341sxb,B00TYMASTER,5,Mon Apr 27 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"I think camo can be be very hit or miss. That style of camo in particular doesn't seem to be very popular or does it look very good on young adults and above (which I assume you are). I see that style of camo most commonly with young children elementary school and younger. It just looks juvenile and somewhat dated. Additionally, not considering the age group it is popular, I personally just don't find it a very attractive camo for fashion or the sweatshirt it is on, looks good in combat. Also it looks cheap to me. Whenever I see a cheap item, usually made by a big name company that sells cheap clothes (H&M, Forever 21, Kmart, Target, etc.) and it has camo (whether on the whole thing or just a pocket or whatever) they tend to use that style of camo so it looks cheap to me. There are just many other better camos to use. Especially considering the price for that crewneck/sweatshirt it is not worth it at all.  TL;DR: Looks juvenile, ugly, and cheap and not worth the price tag.  Edit: Took a lot of my ADHD medication to type my history final paper and just came on reddit for a quick break... so I wrote... a lot. Much more than necessary. Gave you an essay for why I don't like that camo. Wow. Still doing this. Need to get off of reddit. This was a mistake. Must get back to paper... Shit. Still going... can't stop heellllppppp."

TeenMFA,33xoul,argewfhowefh,2,Tue Apr 28 22:55:02 2015 UTC,"she says she doesn't know what style i like, which comes from her not being familiar with the style i'm going for.   i know buying clothes will be somewhat bonding, but to me it's just frustrating. she has a very passive aggressive attitude and seems very hostile. when i say i don't like something she likes, she immediately gets offended.   the problem stems from us having very different ideas of styles and fashion and her refusing to be more open minded about it."

TeenMFA,33u2py,PossomAloysiusJenkns,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:50:50 2015 UTC,ive been on the hunt for light wash jeans for about a year and ive narrowed the options to these two : Levis 501 ($50) or Levis 514 ($30). which one should I get?  i want a pretty loose fit but not too loose
TeenMFA,33u2py,kanyewhite,5,Tue Apr 28 18:32:07 2015 UTC,I like the cut of the 514 more but I'd go to a levi's store (if you can) and try em both on
TeenMFA,33u2py,earthonator,2,Sat Apr 25 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"With light wash, you kind of need a slim/skinny fit. Loose fitting light wash denim is a hallmark of dad core. Personally, I'd go 514, but 511/510/522 would work much better."
TeenMFA,33u2py,kanyewhite,0,Sat Apr 25 20:31:25 2015 UTC,eh don't really like slim fit anymore i tend to kinda look like a cancer patient because im so skinny lol
TeenMFA,33u2py,titaniumwings,2,Sun Apr 26 23:31:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, honestly looking like someone going for a heroin chic look is still slightly preferable to dad watching a rec soccer game. Unless you're going for the Rick drape aesthetic, I wouldn't go that baggy. Like I said, slim straights aren't painted on, but they are at least a step above straight leg."
TeenMFA,33u2py,Shizzable,-1,Sun Apr 26 23:54:08 2015 UTC,Skinny means you wear fitting clothes  Fat people wear baggy clothes
TeenMFA,33u2py,ReddestDevil,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:29:00 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends on which ones fit you better. From what I can tell the 514 is basically just a 501 with a lower rise. From what I've seen, though, the 501 and 514s look too loose if your legs are on the slimmer side."

TeenMFA,33qpmc,peridox,10,Fri Apr 24 18:52:32 2015 UTC,"Generally a monochrome outfit is better, such as black pants and white T-shirt. It will emphasise the shoes."
TeenMFA,33qpmc,Mr_Yeezus,23,Fri Apr 24 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"I dont really agree, i'm thinking more ""toned down"" than ""monochrome"" (black and white are super contrasting, and ""emphasising"" in their own right)"
TeenMFA,33qpmc,Xinijia,2,Fri Apr 24 19:18:06 2015 UTC,that's reassuring to hear as most of my clothes are quite toned down (i don't have very many clothes yet)
TeenMFA,33qpmc,Zaivia,2,Fri Apr 24 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree with you both in a way, and I think you both make sense.  You can tone down in more than one way. Texture, colour, brightness, pattern, fit, it's almost like trying to make something stand out in photoshop. I think if you wore black jeans with a dark grey T-shirt, it would highlight the brightnes and the colour of the shoe. But if you just want the main focus to be it's outstanding colour, then black jeans and a white t-shirt work too. Pretty much any rules that apply in the world of art, also apply in the world of fashion, since - I'd like to think at least - that fashion is art in itself.  One of my favourite outfits is this medium-grey sweater my grandma made me that almost goes half-way down my thighs, but fits fine everywhere else. It was the first sweater she ever knitted so it holds sentimental value. I'll wear that with black skinnies and whatever shoes I want, usually red chucks or white authentics, that way the chucks stand out in colour, and then the vans stand out in brightness. Then the jeans and sweater has such contrasting fit that they look interesting together."

They're all so colorful and interesting, from the mahogany tassel loafers to the bright spotted socks to the light shirt that the dull blue wash of the jeans (tightness is a great contrast though so keep that) looks out of place. Looking back, maybe stone wash isn't the right decision (though it's not the wrong one) but definitely something less gray and more blue would be the move.  This is kind of an odd comparison; this fit feels like it wants to be Wes Anderson now, but the pants just scream Badlands (I've been thinking about fashion a lot in terms of film lately)"

Flat front shorts minus creases would help the fit flow better when looking top to bottom. Watch is dope. Not a fan of the shoes either. For me, dark grey vans like those with the socks just peeking out reminds me of a kid that wears a lot of cargo shorts and pokemon t shirts. An off white/light or charcoal grey shoe would do wonders for the fit.  But hey, it's just my opinion and I could be full of shit. So do what you like and keep to your own personal style b."

You'll be able to get so much more use out of a suit than a tux.  In terms of fit, slim fit suit with narrow lapels. Go with black, and make sure your tie is skinny but not skinny to the point where it's just a string around your neck. Tie colour is up to you. I'm not lucky enough to look good in my favourite colour, but you might be. Just try some out.  Also, I recommend a three piece suit. Makes you look even more badass and makes average size guys like us look more complete :)  Good hunting sir."

I'm talking about shirts kinda like this. Note: I really want that shirt but it's $75. Thrift stores can be a great place to find shirts like that, but a lot of times in my experiences I can only find sizes XXXXXL or larger. Lastly, I got light wash jeans recently and those have been a really awesome addition to my spring wardrobe."

I guess that's what this thread is about :P   Last thing that I remembered is a colored pair of retro runners or something of the sort. You can take you pick between different shades of red, blue, green, whatever you think would suit you most.

TeenMFA,33dh67,Charkol,10,Tue Apr 21 19:33:29 2015 UTC,think you need to really consider what you're saying before you actually say it because a lot of it is extremely unhelpful
TeenMFA,33dh67,asianfuntime,-4,Tue Apr 21 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"okay.  i think this fit is uncreative and unoriginal. it's a repeat of fits that happen every week or every waywt. it in no way looks bad, it looks really good actually.   it's like if i played a beatles song really well. yeah it's impressive, but it's not my song."
TeenMFA,33dh67,this_is_sean,9,Tue Apr 21 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"So what if it's not original or brand new in a way that challenges preconceived concepts of masculinity and the physical form? To use your example of the beatles, they may have been creating new music, but I guarantee they still went back and played hey jude at gigs and when they were jamming just because they were still happy with it and people still liked it.   Sometimes it can be interesting to do a fit you've done before with a couple of details changed, or to do a fit you've seen before on someone else. In the same way that some bands do covers to show how those songs sound in their style, maybe it can be interesting to see these old fits on different people's bodies and with a couple of details in the shape/colour/style of the garments on them.   Sorry I rambled on so long. I just kept thinking of things to say."

TeenMFA,33dh67,YEEZY-SZN,2,Wed Apr 22 03:27:12 2015 UTC,think pin roll (forced taper) would make this better
TeenMFA,33dh67,dindonfootball,4,Wed Apr 22 04:24:00 2015 UTC,That would murder the proportions
TeenMFA,33dh67,lionfire42,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:12:22 2015 UTC,"well I guess I disagree. I think the proportions aren't good atm. I think at least the trousers could be worn higher, which would fix the strangeness at the thighs"
TeenMFA,33dh67,JamesMarsters,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:05:23 2015 UTC,What's strange about the thighs to you? I'm not seeing anything but maybe I'm just blind :-)
TeenMFA,33dh67,Discover_and_Become,2,Tue Apr 21 19:06:26 2015 UTC,"normally I wouldn't be so prescriptive or assertive so I don't want to act like I think I know it all, or I know better or anything - it's just I recently got a very similar pair of trousers and I was messing around with essentially an identical fit (sand & white, loose, open shirt, forwards cap), and the hardest thing to get looking right was the trousers.   If they are anything like mine then they have an adjustable waist and there are basically a very large number of ways to wear them. Of all the ways I experimented with, the ones I liked best either had a forced taper, or were worn higher, or I also liked wearing them without a cuff and having them pool around the shoes, almost bigbeeee style. I will take a fit pic or something in a bit. Its all subjective tho and it sounds like we just have different personal preferences. I just wanted to convey how I thought the fit could be improved"
TeenMFA,33dh67,JamesMarsters,2,Tue Apr 21 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Nah man are this cheap as hell Cubavera pair with drawstrings, wish they were cool and had adjustable waist and stuff.  I mean, they are just super loose trees in the end, pretty straight in the top block with an ugly settle which means I have to cuff up a bit (until I hem)  I think the real problem with this is lying in my top, ugly hat and ugly over shirt are bad. But I feel like the trees are fine you know? They sorta set the proportions for this fit IMO, like it's built around them instead of the other way around, which means id probably need to change a lot more with a heavy taper and+ I like my stuff loose and open personally, which is where that subjectivity comes in!  I really appreciate the idea though! It made me think about potential options and I do love to explore so I think I might try It out!"
TeenMFA,33dh67,Discover_and_Become,3,Tue Apr 21 19:19:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's the subjectivity in the end  To me the first look great  And that taper looks p good too, but idk, the idea of a straight leg is much more appealing to me  Damn you did open some doors though. Thanks a lot!"

Franny and Zooey is good too, and if you haven't read Catcher in the Rye yet, you should definitely give it a shot. Heart of Darkness is a classic too.  If you're interested is a subject you should look at the ""Very Short Introduction"" series that Oxford does, they're a great way to easily learn a little about a subject, I just finished one on ethnomusicology that was really good."

I mean yeah, you could take it off or hide it. Doesn't replace the fact it is Hollister or a&f, but they soo good with clearances and they came really far compared to their horrible graphic tees.  Fit is generally aimed for bigger Americans, and never buy if it is not on sale. Ever.  But if you genuinely did not care, no one else will."

The final one is always a galla, but not special for anyone that isnt a senior student. I had to clean up afterwards and all my friends left because they couldnt be assed. So it was me one other guy and like 5 girls cleaning up. During this I realized that I really like one of them, we are in the same class so its not like it was something on the spot. Only problem is she is in a really good relationship so won't touch her. All other chicks I could have a shot with is in in her group of friends as well. Not much I really can do haha. Wouldn't say I'm in love tho she's just the one I would like to have something with if I had to choose. Can banter well with her, she's smart etc.. Her boyfriend is leaving school this summer tho, so one could hope their relationship cools down etc. Don't even know where I'm going with this haahah.   Also I'm gonna start hitting the gym again, should be good to shred some kilos since Im starting to put so much weight on after I cam home from boarding school last summer. Goal is to get back in to a XL at first and then we'll see."

TeenMFA,333211,nikolaprof,5,Sun Apr 19 16:58:27 2015 UTC,A reason why you might not be seeing much of the second rule is that the mods try to remove anything offensive as quickly as possible. But in the last WAYWT thread lots of comments had to be removed. Which is strange because most of the time nothing really bad gets posted.

TeenMFA,331lt9,AlienComingIn,3,Sat Apr 18 20:34:24 2015 UTC,What was your ratio of bleach to water. If you take them out of the solution does it still look green. Either way I think you should just take them out and rinse them

TeenMFA,32yd53,Shizzable,17,Fri Apr 17 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"Summer is great as it gives you a chance to wear fabrics and clothes you just wouldn't wear in the winter, linnen, mesh, lighter cottons with just walking around in top, bottom shoes being quite refreshing.   I also think people have this aversion to buying summer specific clothes which ofc makes summer boring for them, if you're willing to buy a snazzy chunky cable knit or baller jacket for those cold months, why not buy a fancy shirt or such for the summer? Both can only be worn for 6 months of the year. I have a mesh zip shirt from Raeburn I love wearing in the summer months which keeps me cool as it's like being topless, also some lighter weight trousers from Shannon and Raeburn which are great for spring and early summer. Some great pieces I saw people wearing last summer were mesh polos, various types of cropped trousers and shorts (you'd be amazed about the number of people who think only flat front chino shorts are the only option), tops of various sizes as well as combining lightweight, breathable fabrics for layering (Raeburn ss14 is a perfect example)."
TeenMFA,32yd53,erolsonhue,5,Fri Apr 17 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the first summer of caring about fashion. About mid winter when I started experimenting more with layers and stuff I was dreading it just because the heat limits you so much, but now I'm stoked. Excited to try out new shit, like linen, tevas, interesting shorts, etc."
TeenMFA,32yd53,Rhythianne,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree, though I did find myself limited with layering in the winter.

TeenMFA,32yd53,Zephyrv,2,Fri Apr 17 21:27:30 2015 UTC,I don't think you can stick bleach in the washing machine like that. Might be better off diluting some in a large bucket and then dunking the jeans through that (use gloves)   Edit: or just ask the guy below who just bleached his
TeenMFA,32yd53,tzarttar,5,Sat Apr 18 14:27:59 2015 UTC,"First off I'd just like to say that this might make no sense to anyone because of how tired I was when I typed this.  I've got a lot on my mind right now when it comes to fashion, so hopefully as I'm typing this out stream of consciousness style everything will come out intelligibly. I don't know if I have any questions, I just feel like saying something since sometimes that helps me think things through and organize my thoughts a bit more. Maybe some people here can relate to this a bit and share some advice or something like that. However, I would first like to share this video. These are the highlights from a tournament I had last week, not the best in terms of highlight quality but it's fun to watch if you're into ultimate.  At the moment, I'm at somewhat of a crossroads in terms of fashion. I've been thinking about different styles/aesthetics/whateveryouwanttocallthem that appeal to me and trying to decide which one I would like to go for. Right now I feel like I'm not really dressing really well because I have no direction or driving idea behind my fits. I want to go one way with a fit but my wardrobe restricts it so I just give up and wear something that I'm not entirely sold on. In the past I had been really inspired by people like heck (lol) and really just ended up just trying to copy him and others similar to him rather than doing something that was my own. Recently, I've really been feeling a more techwear (is that still cool to say? Was that ever cool to say?) and military-ish oriented style, brands like acronym and stone island, as well as stuff like wtaps (I guess that isn't really ""techwear,"" but I feel still can fit in with that look sometimes) really appeal to me right now. However, I'm afraid that if I decide to start down this new path I'll just do the same thing and decide that ""techwear"" isn't the style I want to be going for.  That's all the rambling I have in me for right now, hopefully you guys could make sense of it."
TeenMFA,32yd53,Rhythianne,5,Sat Apr 18 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"I definitely get where you're coming from. I too don't really have a specific style or aesthetic. I have a lot of black clothing, but I have some prep or floral or whatever because I admire it on other people and try to emulate the same thing on me but it doesn't always work out. What ends up happening is that it's hard for me to mix up my wardrobe since I have so many items that don't really go with each other. So I can empathize what you mean by that, you're not the only one ha."
TeenMFA,32yd53,gethdrips,2,Sat Apr 18 04:49:56 2015 UTC,"really late reply, and this isn't what most people would advise, but I was in your position for months and months, and I feel this helped.   what helped me was just buying a pretty low-key piece that would fit in with the aesthetic I was looking for and working out multiple fits around it, alongside pieces I already owned, that all came under the more general style I was aiming for, to make sure that what I was aiming for was feasible without spending too much $$. After that it's a lot less daunting laying down money on individual pieces bc you'll already be sure that the ideas in your head work for you irl.  So, if you're more interested in tech/military stuff, maybe try picking up a pair of slim cargoes (Levi's, uniqlo etc.) or a pair of cheaper combat boots (surplus, docs etc.),  so a staple of that style and just wear those for a while and see how you feel."

We're still very close.  Best friends.  We hang out, and she means a lot to me.  She's great, and I'd never want to do anything to hurt her.  We broke up about a month ago.  There's this guy.  Call him B.  We've been friends for years.  He's cool to hang out with, and generally a pretty entertaining person.  But he's an asshole.  I've never once seen him put anyone else ahead of himself.  He has an issue with co-dependence, and defining himself through others.  He's fairly manipulative, and overall uses others when it benefits him.  He dated another friend of mine, call her C, for about a year.  She broke it off, and has never looked back.  I was so glad when she did, he was bad for her.  Not a good person to be in a relationship with, to say the least.  He used her, and was only nice to her when he had something to gain from it.  Now A and B just started dating.  And I'm like fuuuuuccccck.  Right?  Fuck him.  But mainly, I'm worried about her.  So, do I tell her, or what?  Let her figure it out for herself?  Just, what do I do?"

Might not be the best of ideas though.   But if you are really best friends with A, tell her her how the other relationship went. But if all are a part of the same group hasnt she seen how he treated the other girl?"
TeenMFA,32yd53,FartsInQuietPlaces,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"No, we were all part of two pretty distinct groups at the time.  B, C, and I were a part of the debate team, and that in itself formed a pretty damn distinct group.  C and a large portion of the people we hung around with graduated last year.  I was semi a part of a second group, which was made up of A and her friends.  Not sure how I'd classify them, if I had to.  I'd been close friends with all of them since back in like 7th grade though, and only moved into the debate circle in 10th on.  So after so many debate kids and a large part of the other group graduated, the two groups ended up mainly fusing together.  But A and C were never friends, and she missed seeing how it played out.  C and I were best friends(closer than I was with anyone else at the time, and we still are really close, even though she's off to college), and since A and I were dating, they ended up being bumped into each other, but they were never close, and A missed that relationship entirely."

Here's what I would do: Wait for the first sign of trouble in their relationship, the first red flag, the first thing that Guy B does that starts to show his true self and talk to girl A about it. Maybe you could also get Girl C to testify on his shitty personality. Who knows, maybe there won't be any warning signs and everyone will live haply ever after."

Broke up w/ gf almost 2 months ago, had thing with other girl, old gf got mad (very very very mad) and slapped me.   So a week or so ago I got a text from ex-gf, she explained she was sorry she overreacted, etc. So that's chill. Been hanging out with new girl fairly frequently with no complications until last night. Having sex, condom broke, didn't notice till after. Fuck. Had to go to the store and get plan-b, which really wasn't what I had planned for the night.

TeenMFA,32wvtu,teamhoun,6,Fri Apr 17 15:27:29 2015 UTC,The point of fashion is not exclusively to look good   I agree. The point of fashion is whatever you make it to be. Almost all designers choose to push the boundaries. While I don't think it is their ultimate aim it definitely part of the reason for designing the clothes that they do.
TeenMFA,32wvtu,Vatmag,3,Fri Apr 17 15:50:13 2015 UTC,i'm really pleased with how nice this subreddit is. It's good to see that we as teenagers can be a lot more accepting than a lot of adults on other subreddits.
TeenMFA,32wvtu,teamhoun,-7,Fri Apr 17 19:56:49 2015 UTC,">The point of fashion is not exclusively to look good.  There is a difference between avant-garde ""fashion as art"" and actual clothing. I also reject the ""dress for yourself"" counterculture  Clothing is an incredibly social phenomenon; it communicates something about you to the outside world. If you truly didn't care about how you came off to the outside world, you would just wear sweats everywhere. Fashion does not exist in a vacuum, and its important to consider what message you are communicating though your clothing. Being edgy isn't fashionable, it simply makes you stand out (usually in a negative way)."
TeenMFA,32wvtu,lionfire42,6,Fri Apr 17 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"it's not this black-and-white border where if you do a certain thing or dress a certain way you're suddenly ""avant-garde."" All of these things are sliding scales. I don't think this is the place for absolutism."
TeenMFA,32wvtu,_mildude,-2,Fri Apr 17 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"You're not addressing my central point at all. Of course its a sliding scale, I can recognize that. But you have to be aware of the message your clothing is displaying to the outside world. If you don't care, that's fine, but don't pretend it doesn't matter. First impressions are hugely important"
TeenMFA,32wvtu,teamhoun,3,Fri Apr 17 19:46:26 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone has denied that you're right about context and first impression. If I had something to add which addressed your main point I would have said it.
TeenMFA,32wvtu,jegbyrd,-2,Sat Apr 18 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"Actually quite a few people have, oddly enough. And you didn't address anything that wasn't obviously implied"
TeenMFA,32wvtu,teamhoun,7,Sat Apr 18 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to impress everyone, you'd have to dress for every persons' personal style, which is impossible. You may attract a certain type of person depending on how you dress, but what makes someone who wears band tshirts and black jeans less attractive (worth your time, interesting) than someone who wears boat shoes and polos or vice versa?   You can integrate avant garde fashion into ""normal clothes"" if that's what you want, that that won't necessarily attract anymore negative attention than wearing Vans in certain circles, for example.   Also, believe it or not, some people don't want to wear sweats everywhere and like dressing the way that they do. They wear what they want. Some people might interpret that as weird, just because it's not ""normal"" but others could see that as just a different interest or passion.   Ultimately, you should just do whatever you want.   Also sorry if none of this makes sense, I'm on mobile"
TeenMFA,32wvtu,jegbyrd,-4,Fri Apr 17 16:03:25 2015 UTC,"""Do whatever you want"" is probably the worst fashion advice you could possibly give. Dressing for the situation you're in is important"
TeenMFA,32wvtu,teamhoun,3,Fri Apr 17 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"Don't do what you want to then? Gotcha   I'm just saying that if you make laws about what people can and cannot wear in certain situations, you take away part of the appeal of fashion.  Also, following those laws does not make you fashionable, it just shows that you can follow a fashion infographic"
TeenMFA,32wvtu,lionfire42,-2,Fri Apr 17 17:21:29 2015 UTC,And I'm just saying you have to take into account context and the social implications of your clothing

Also two of my friends has told me that they are gonna find some chick or something at said party not really sure about that tho haha.   Also all the guys in my class are like very good looking compared to me, when we talk girls they always slam girls that I wouldn't mind. Cant really say anything due to fear of being made fun of etc. Our tone is really rough which saddens me a little. Also some of them are pushing the sex thing on me everytime a party is involved I'm content with being virgin as it stands atm. but I also have to consider that I'm turning 18 soon fuck life sometimes."
TeenMFA,32pdc3,ThePancakemix,9,Thu Apr 16 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"people tend to be really harsh when it comes to talking about people they like, as if their is some line you must be above, it definitely sucks. I've been in that situation a few times and it's important to note attraction isn't just caused by superficial things, stand up for who you like and don't be put down by others as it doesn't fit their constructs, it'll be rough at first sure but if they maintain it after you've talked to them at any level more than jokes you're comfortable with they weren't really friends to begin with. you might also find others feel the same way and back you up in some cases.   sex at younger ages is usually held as this massive you have to do it thing when it really doesn't matter, and the age you first do it is arbitrary and doesn't say anything about who you are (i was 19, i've known many people older and of course others younger). when i joined uni and was out with people they all wanted to help each other ""hook up with others"" and they tried it with me a few times but like you, it made me uncomfortable. i'm not into that stuff and I was content to wait for someone i actually liked (which they understood, as friends should), i'm glad i did wait because and found someone i truly like as it was what i wanted. if that's what you want, or even if you just simply feel you don't want anything right now then you shouldn't be afraid to say it and people should respect you for your choices.   at the end of the day, it's just sex."
TeenMFA,32pdc3,erolsonhue,3,Thu Apr 16 03:12:19 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this type of post, just because it shows that I'm not completely fucked in the head. I think a lot of my problems has root in the fact that I got hardcore bullied for like 7 years until I swapped schools. Even though its quite a long time ago(swapped schools in like 09 or something), it has made some pretty deep scars on my self confidence.   I'm by no means like an ugly dude I just have that extra fat on the body that fucks me up completely. But I'm really self conscious about it and I tend to give up because of that in quite a few scenarios. Also I still have a hard time taking it the last step and actually get girls to like me: I can pull of conversations really well. I'm an incredibly smart guy as long as the talk isn't scientific or math related. I have become less socially awkward by doing one year of boarding school where I focused on socializing instead of focusing on my school work since I had that down and it deffo helped me out a lot. I tend to fuck up by saying the wrong thing at the wrong times. I have some pretty saying examples: here    It is one of the reasons that I have finally made it up with myself that I'm gonna start working out again and dressing well for the first time in my life. Need to up my game too many handsome lads at my school for me to ever get noticed. Also the year at boarding school means that I'm turning 18 whilst a lot of my friends are turning 17 or have just turned it so I'm a year ahead since is why the pressure is bigger on me from their side. Fuck the media calling out girls having it way harder than boys. Society is getting so fucking skewed towards girls."
TeenMFA,32pdc3,ThePancakemix,2,Thu Apr 16 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"i can imagine that has knocked your confidence quite a bit, it's always important to keep in mind that being comfortable in yourself is the one thing which shines through the most to people. no-ones a harsher critic than ourselves and it's important to be aware of who you are and where you want to go when you start to feel the need to look and shape up for others approval. if you keep this in mind when meeting people and looking to better yourself as a person you'll walk a much easier line, as well as being more content in the future. i say this as i've seen many friends, and even myself fall into the trap of rapidly changing their outwards appearance to fit in with others for acceptance only to have it not meeting their expectations, or to find nothings changed when they get there.   while it can be hard to see media focusing on girls and their issues surrounding body image you have to realize this is a recent turn in the tides, and came after long and hard battles to even have the arguments voiced. it's an important conversation for us all to have and in many ways they do have it extremely hard , it's important however to realize noting someone else's struggle does not diminish your own. i don't think society is skewed towards girls in most senses (stats and trends prove this), but people are becoming more aware that there are issues that have to be solved and these issues are gaining media traction, and many of the people arguing for the changes for women will also be arguing for men facing these problems also. although mainstream and certain social media outlets may not always show this."
TeenMFA,32pdc3,erolsonhue,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying that they have it hard. I just wouldnt say that they have it harder than men. Educational statistics in Denmark has shown that a lot of guys/boys gets lost really early in the educational run and girls take the leading position. Also men are fading out of a lot of important roles in society because they can't work with children without being under suspicion being a pedo. So boys from a young age is starting to lack male influence in their lives which is massive problem. Also everytime something psygocical pressure related comes on tvshows its always about how girls are under the most pressure and have it the hardest. Fun thing is that suicide is a way bigger problem between men that it is between women. Source. As a man you are under pressure to just do thing and act as man, not allowed to show emotion etc. which also something that I'm starting to faze even more now with the whole sex spectacle."
TeenMFA,32pdc3,nikolaprof,3,Wed Apr 15 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"it's true, males preform on average worse than girls in schools due to policies over the last 30 years helping females level the playing field, these policies have proved very effective and have caused them to out achieve the males. however research also suggests to solve this the solution is not to take the light of females, but to just add the light to males. the publications which write these findings also criticise the media for enforcing the girls do better stereo type for being damaging to boys, however this doesn't get translated to that same media  i recently wrote a report in males in teaching roles for my uni course coincidently as it's something i'm massively interested in. i myself considered being a primary school teacher, and many on my course are already working actively in schools report the same issue. it's true women significantly outnumber men but interestingly enough those stats don't translate to management or non-student facing roles in which males still dominate (glass elevator/tradtional views of men as leaders). research also shows in studies men don't benifit from more male teachers, and in that the idea that men should have different roles in school to be a masculine figure not only undermines the female teachers authority in the class room, but also enforces the same stereotype that drives males away from teaching. the idea that men are men and they're strict, powerful, like football ect ect. men being prevented from entering a field because of views on gender in the workplace is a problem, men or women teaching a class is arguably minimal impact according to research which obviously, always changing (report i read was 2012).    as for the media i personally can't stand it myself and a lot of publications who write the reports, professionals in the field who work on sociological gender disparities damn it heavily in a lot of cases, they're very much in agreement with you.   suicide rates are higher within men and this is a issue which needs to be addressed, but the source you sited while being a correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation. however men not feeling they have access or people reaching out to them for physiological help is a problem and needs to be addressed, but i again repeat the same idea that the people arguing for progression there are the same also trying to help females. linking back to the unrepresentative, sensationalist media that i previously mentioned being criticised.   gender as a whole has lots of issues that need to be addressed, and vocally right now it may seem that women are being treated as the only ones with real problems. however i can assure you outside of mainstream and social media circles that is not the case. for example the under achievement of males in the British school system, as well as the removal of social barriers for male teachers has a massive focus on it right now in terms of research and government policy in the uk, i can't speak for america as it's not my field"

I've seen them look decent, but never thought it improved the fit.  Or couldn't have been replaced with something better.  I also feel it's a very ""teen"" look.  Makes it seem like you're trying to be either overly dressy(almost never matches formality with fit, from what I've seen), and like you pulled something from dad's closet, and forgot the rest of the suit. I honestly see it as the approximate equivalent of throwing a fedora on to ""spice things up"".  You do you though.  Just saying be very, very careful with it.

TeenMFA,32pdc2,CHEtheKONG,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:38:09 2015 UTC,The shirt is a little tight around the neck I might get a bigger one. Do you think any other color dress shirts would look good? My date wants black but I think that looks ugly. The pants are a slim which I'm surprised fit me because of my hips but I think they're ok.
TeenMFA,32pdc2,ThePancakemix,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:38:12 2015 UTC,I guess you could try a dark navy shirt.

The pants are good imo but I don't know if I need to taper my suit or something.  http://imgur.com/YYKqfRY.jpg  This is what my date sent me, I don't think that even Hugh Jackman can pull it off.

Been on no-cop for just over 4 months now, have a good mental inventory of where I'm at clothes wise. Sold a decent chunk of stuff from my wardrobe too. I feel like I have all of my ""basics"" nailed down now and college will just be me getting one or two nice pieces each year if I find stuff I really dig. Good experience, a lot happier with 'fashion' because of it. Not that my wardrobe got better, just that I feel much more content with what I wear."

TeenMFA,32jfzk,DucklingMissing1Foot,35,Tue Apr 14 07:34:37 2015 UTC,"Hey man, it's really cool that you want to up your style and take care of how you look. But please, please don't make the same mistake me and so many others did. Dressing nicely doesn't necessarily mean wearing dressy clothes. Those (slacks, suspenders, bow tie) are for events or gatherings (ya know what I mean) that are far less casual than the school environment. If you dress up that much (like I did... I'll supply pictures if you like...) you'll stand out like a sore thumb. However, I would recommend dressing for the occasion, which is as you said, ""a laid back school."" If that's the case, dress laid back. Get a pair of nice fitting jeans (Levi's 511 is a great start), some cool sneakers (plenty to choose from, check out some ""What Are You Wearing Today""s for some inspiration), and a few slim fit shirts (tees or button downs, I like the fit and style of mine from J. Crew [Factory]). Just another warning: DON'T OVER DO IT.  Trust me on this one, I was you about a year and a half ago. Please feel free to ask me any questions, people here are really helpful and eager to give you some assistance. Shaka  And here's a link to the most recent TeenMFA What Are You Wearing post. A lot of the stuff will throw you off, personally not much of it lines up with my style, especially since the 90's are coming back. But pick and choose a few things that catch your eye and maybe try to emulate them. /r/malefashionadvice also has these threads and generally has a more...

TeenMFA,32jfzk,melancholy_cojack,8,Tue Apr 14 08:33:28 2015 UTC,Oh my god thank you I was so worried and none of my friends gave strait opinions on it. I'm really shy and awkward so in glad you pointed that out! This was my first post in reddit so I didn't know what to expect and that's just what I was looking for so thanks ive made my decision so once again for good measures thank you very much!
TeenMFA,32jfzk,FartsInQuietPlaces,3,Tue Apr 14 08:47:08 2015 UTC,"Huge block of text and advice incoming.  Read it, please.  It may take you 5 or 10 minutes, but they took me months and hundreds of dollars to learn.  One big thing that I would say based on my own experience, and advice I've seen, is don't buy too much too quickly.  Start with the basics, or later you'll likely be left with a lot of stuff you don't really like later on.  Like he said, get some slim fitting jeans, preferably in a dark wash.  Maybe dark indigo.  They say 510, sounds good to me.  Some nice, well fitting shirts.  I'd say it'd be hard to go wrong with a slim fit OCBD(oxford cloth button down, refers to the fabric, which resembles two different threads woven together, usually something like blue and white; and the buttoned down collar).  Depending on where you live, may be bought many places.  My favorite I actually picked up at Target for like twenty dollars.  And again, dressing nice=/=dressing fancy.  It's about the fit and style of the clothes, and matching them to the occasion.  Not about wearing slacks and a dress shirt to school.  It's getting to be summer(again, depends on location) so maybe cop some shorts.  I'd recommend American Eagle, which are pretty ubiquitous throughout the U.S.  Some others may disagree, but I like that they have a store near me, I can try them on, they aren't SUPER expensive, and almost always on sale, and they seem to be pretty good quality.  Their shorts specifically, I've been impressed by the workmanship of.  Or, again, target.  My rules of thumb for shorts are:  1. No cargo shorts.  None.  I repeat, none.  2. never past the knee(most of mine are at least an inch above the knee, standing)  3. Not super loose, especially at the bottom, that flair makes your legs look super skinny, no matter who you are  So, start with maybe a basic pair of khaki shorts.  Can be paired with almost anything.  That and a light blue botton-up, and you're golden.  Basic, easy, nice looking fit.  As far as shirt fit, the shoulder seam should hit at the end of your shoulder bone on the side.  Sorry if that's a poor description.  But really, it fitting in the shoulders is the MOST IMPORTANT part of shirt fit.  Also consider:  sleeve length, shirt length, and how it fits in the torso.   There's a guide somewhere, probably in the sidebar.  When buying, keep in mind:  price, fit, quality, and versatility.  I'd recommend buying pieces that are versatile.  Like dark wash jeans, or khaki shorts.  Or plain colour button-ups/downs.  You don't want to buy a shirt and then say, ""Oh, wait, what can I wear this with?"".  Before you buy it you want to be able to go, ""This would look good with x, y, or z that I have.""  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'll respond eventually!  Or just comment on this!  Best of luck, been right where you are.  About the same time, actually.  I'm 18 now, for reference.  Again, best of luck, man.  :)"

When I got out of the ""my parents dress me like an orphan"" stage, I bought 2 pairs of size 28 chinos (these may fit you as well, BTW, because I weight about 125 when I bought them. I bought some thigh high shorts, two nice button-ups, and a couple pairs of Vans.  You accessorize with whatever you want, maybe a traditional ball-cap, I turn mine backwards. A couple bracelets would look good, maybe leather and beads.  Haircut is also a huge part of you. Please for the love of God, don't get the Hitler Youth. It's so overly used and a lot of people with it only got it because they saw the models with it. Allow your hair describe you. My personal preference is 6 on the sides and 8 on the top, and because I like to swoop my hair over to the right, I leave the bangs over."

AEO carries decent flat front chino shorts and some button downs. The trick with AEO is finding their good and cool stuff without their logo.

At Old Navy they can have some good stuff, but their slim fits are more like every other places regular fits when it comes to shirts.

We didn't talk for about 6 months, but once we did start talking again we picked up right where we left off and are really good friends again.

But for like the next two days I was very doubtful for some reason that she liked me even tho we had that kiss so idk haha. I'm probably thinking that we leave prom a little early and then we go somewhere and chill and look at the stars. And then that's when I tell her.

TeenMFA,32cj8q,spencer102,29,Mon Apr 13 01:55:59 2015 UTC,"something i noticed recently was people giving ""advice"" in the form of telling them what they would wear in that outfit. this is useless because it doesn't take into account the original poster's personal style and taste, and it's kind of annoying to see.  i guess what i'm trying to say tbf is give better advice, or at least be more open."
TeenMFA,32cj8q,lionfire42,20,Sun Apr 12 17:23:59 2015 UTC,"very true  i've said this before, but i'll reiterate: don't just comment something lazy like ""you should swap out those shoes for stans because i like stans""  at the very least, what you guys can do to combat this problem is try to understand the perspective of the dude you wish to give advice to. that is, try to understand why they wore x with y and the circumstances of what they were wearing / the look they were going for. if, after looking at all those, you still think stans would be better suited there, say that, but give reasons why other than ""i like them."" if you must, a simple ""what look were you going for here?"" instead of just molding the op into your standards would suffice."

TeenMFA,32cj8q,TheDutchWonder,21,Sun Apr 12 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I still don't understand this. I read the comment he posted explaining his style and why he chooses certain pieces, but he basically said that he wears them ironically like he used to do back in (whatever town he said he's from).   I understand why he likes what he wears, and I respect him for that, it's pretty cool, but how can you say that you like his fits? None of them really look aesthetically appealing. Would you wear what he wears?  I guess I just don't understand why anyone other than himself likes his fits."
TeenMFA,32cj8q,RealityIsFalse,24,Sun Apr 12 19:00:16 2015 UTC,I would wear what he wears
TeenMFA,32cj8q,TheDutchWonder,12,Sun Apr 12 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, cuz you're a goon"
TeenMFA,32cj8q,Cuteywithd,9,Sun Apr 12 22:09:47 2015 UTC,I guess I just don't understand why anyone other than himself likes his fits.   and there would be a lot of people who agree with you and those who would disagree with you but that's okay because if everyone agreed with each other the world would be a boring place
TeenMFA,32cj8q,spencer102,6,Sun Apr 12 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"Nope. I wouldn't wear what he wears. I also wouldn't wear what Rick Owens would wear, but does that mean I can't admire what he creates? Honestly, I think the reason I like what he wears is because of the unique and specific aesthetic it makes. When I see what he wears it makes me think about why I wear what I wear. Lionfire injected his own culture and personality into his style, and it's communicated very well.  Beyond me just admiring why he does what he does though, I also think he pulls off looser clothing and different colors well, which is something that can be harder to find in a fashion forum, where a lot of people (myself included) wear skinny jeans and blander color palettes. He often takes pieces that I generally think wouldn't work and meshes them into an outfit that makes them not only blend with the rest of the outfit, but improves it.   I hope that answers your question."
TeenMFA,32cj8q,dylan424,5,Sun Apr 12 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I understand the aspect of admiration, I guess I'm just not into that type of style, even from an admiration point of view."

Option 1  Option 2  Option 3 I have a dope galaxy jacket to go with these!  and Option 4  Any suggestions on what I could wear with any of these options would be appreciated also! Things like what jeans/shirts/etc. would help a lot. :)
TeenMFA,328vxu,Citrine_Excalibur,4,Sun Apr 12 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"I don't like the leather back and tongue on the first pair, and I don't like the monochromatic blandness of the second pair. I do really like the last two pair tho. Matching Galaxy is cool and I like the black and blue, but they aren't really spring colors but it's all you mane!   With what you could wear with them, I would say going back to the springtime part, shorts are a good idea, unless it's still really cold wherever you are. I think just some khaki shorts would go with either of the last pair , but I'm not sure myself. Plain/solid color T-shirts work well sometimes, especially if you have other busy parts of your fit (the galaxy combo). I'm somewhat new too, but I hope I helped, good luck :)"
TeenMFA,328vxu,Aphlynx,2,Sat Apr 11 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"You basically mimicked my thoughts on them! Great minds think alike, I guess. TBH none of my wardrobe is 'spring' colored, so I think that will be ok.   I REALLY like the grey ones but the tongue is so off-putting, the Brigatas may be better in the blue option. I'm 50/50 on the galaxy/black and blue ones.  I don't own any shorts, shockingly enough. Jeans all day every day. I work on a farm in the summers and the heat has never been a problem, plus by now my legs are the color of printer paper, and shorts would NOT be a good idea lol  For the black/blue ones I was thinking like white tee, darkish jeans, badass socks and MAYBE a penny roll to show em off a bit?"

I'm going to a Men's Warehouse near me, and it's well under $200 for a rental (depending on what you choose). The employees are super friendly and helpful (at least at the location near me), so I'd recommend trying a similar approach."
TeenMFA,328az8,Manawah,-4,Sun Apr 12 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"Your girlfriend is right. For prom, a tuxedo is pretty much the standard. If you really, desperately, want to go with something else... Still go with a tux. That's how important they are."
TeenMFA,328az8,-y-y-,10,Sat Apr 11 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"nah. prom is about having fun, no one actually likes a fuck what you wear. look sharp, turn up, have a good time. no tux required."

Went to an Allen Edmonds store beforehand to dial in my size, so I knew that was for sure. The only thing I didn't know (or anticipate to not know for that matter) was the color, as it is discontinued through mainline AE and only still exists on the Nordstrom rack exclusive model I got. However, still wasn't a risk because free shipping and free returns. So nothing lost, just frustrating and disappointing. That being said, I might hit up a local dew now that you mention it."

TeenMFA,320ofq,FrogDie,4,Thu Apr 9 21:45:27 2015 UTC,It was about 30$ I think. It was cheap enough were I felt like giving it a chance.
TeenMFA,320ofq,FartingLikeFlowers,2,Thu Apr 9 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely reasonable, bonbers are more and more desirable. Thought of looking for one in Amsterdam but saw nothing under 50 EUR... Surprising because surely the build costs can't explain the price."

TeenMFA,320kut,akuroniumu,3,Thu Apr 9 17:10:11 2015 UTC,I'm way closer to buying those Julius kubanorums than I should be cause I'd never be able to pull em iff

TeenMFA,320kut,mc-lunar,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:01:28 2015 UTC,lmao that is true. its funny how one of the few things that the average person spends a lot of money on is something that can be gotten for so cheap. but persol and ray ban have brand recognition and are still very solid
TeenMFA,320kut,Pengyster,2,Thu Apr 9 17:11:38 2015 UTC,Eyebuydirect sells quality yet cheap sunglasses. Non-prescription Wayfarers (dubbed Malibu on the site) goes for $39. Pretty good deal if you ask me.
TeenMFA,320kut,yungmung,3,Fri Apr 10 04:22:58 2015 UTC,"Me personally, I don't have a problem with cheap sunglasses. I found some cheap knockoff Wayfarers that look and feel identical, minus the little (rayban logo) for like 5$ on Ebay that I actually like better than my Dad's actual pair (they're actually a bit darker, and they're polarized). Honestly, I just can't get into expensive sunglasses. I'd be too worried about breaking them or leaving them somewhere, or something like that.   If you're interested, I'll provide a link in a few hours. On mobile currently and it's kinda a pain.  EDIT: Here's the link."

You want glasses that protect your eyes from UVA and UVB, where cheap sunglasses usually just have UVA.   Also, if cheap sunglasses are dark enough, they dilate your eyes so you'll get even more UBV and it could damage your eyesight.   All this could be wrong."

TeenMFA,31w70x,argewfhowefh,3,Wed Apr 8 17:42:49 2015 UTC,"really depends what youre trying to dress like. that camo jacket could still work with a light pink (almost a salmon) tee, or possibly even a stripe tee if the stripes are lowkey enough.  navy could look cool if you wear the correct stuff with it... otherwise it could end up looking a bit too formal than you want. if you had it as an oversized fit it would look reaaally cool imo."

TeenMFA,31w70x,argewfhowefh,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:04:38 2015 UTC,For me Uniqlo shirts fit a little bit boxy so I'd say 1 size if you're slim and 2 sizes if you're normal build.

Fuck off. I wore my Shadow 1s to a concert and he called me a retard because they are $600 on flightclub, why the fuck does it matter to you, no one buys shit of flightclub, I bought them for retail and they're my shoes, why do I give a fuck.

I didnt see what city the show was held in though. If it was paris or milan then this low number totally makes sense as the black population in these cities is very small. And even then, it seems like it would just be a wiser business move to feature mostly white models, as white people (who are on average wealthier and thus more likely to buy slp) can probably identify more with white models. This is all just speculation though and id love to see an actual article on the incident"

TeenMFA,31w70x,akuroniumu,-2,Thu Apr 9 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"Why is it disgusting? i cant find the statistics for france, but in the us the average white person makes substantially more, so it makes sense for expensive brands to focus on white people. It makes sense for a brand to use members of its target demographic as its models. Note: I cant find statistics on race and clothing budget, so im just assuming that white people spend more on it since they have more to spend in total  Also, do you know how many models there were in total at the show? Because if each model walked twice like the black one, then 1 out of 22 4.6% which isnt that far from the actual percentage of black population."
TeenMFA,31w70x,PossomAloysiusJenkns,9,Thu Apr 9 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"Many people criticise fashion for portraying unhealthy lifestyles and glorifying unhealthy weights, imposing unrealistic expectations on women and men alike. The argument ""they're marketing to skinny people though"" holds no weight and it shouldn't, they're on a global stage regardless of where they choose to show, and as such are responsible for the lifestyles and images they promote.  The same argument is held for race, the whitewashing of fashion and media as a whole is quite frankly disturbing. Everyone should be able to see themselves represented, the pandering to ""whites like to see whites"" is quite frankly horrid and wrong. It's views like this which throw up social barriers between racial groups, breeding stereotypes and influencing xenophobia to certain degrees. Equal Representation is essential to preach a message of equality and social progressivism. You may have noticed iOS recently updated its emojis to be either racially neutral or to be able to select the race, regardless of what ""proportion"" owns their phone, this is industry standard and is upheld in most fields. Great consideration goes into stuff like this to limit direct or indirect exclusion in other industries, fashion is no exception."

Edit- https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2ruLJ9i5nBA this girl does her cutting distress really well. Remember to pull out the extra threads or you'll have awkward looking tears. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy4WnVa2dzQ This guy does a lot of the details and stuff well, but he didn't pull out the vertical threads. Results aren't as good.  Edit 2- quick put this together just to give you ideas of how big to make the cuts and how long the tears should/could be. If you end up DIYing this, take pics and post here and possibly mfa. I don't think there's a proper ""tearing skinny jeans"" guide. Godspeed."

I don't really have a problem with you not liking it and I get your reasoning (I'm not huge into jump scares or gore or stuff like that, so that may be a big part of why I liked it a lot), but it seems like you're pretty much discouraging people from seeing it based solely on your own preference."

TeenMFA,31e2q0,Connorvoire,52,Sat Apr 4 04:39:42 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, any teenffa person who wants to post here is welcome to. Merging the 2 subs seems unnecessarily formal to me"
TeenMFA,31e2q0,Vatmag,-1,Sat Apr 4 04:50:49 2015 UTC,In one of the last cop or not thread there was a grill asking about a jacket i think.

TeenMFA,31e2q0,chiceaux,30,Sun Apr 5 00:28:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem necessary, but to be fair if a girl comments on my outfit vs a guy comments on my outfit at school, I will usually take the girls comment more into consideration"
TeenMFA,31e2q0,Mawrawr,13,Sat Apr 4 05:51:29 2015 UTC,"Is that IRL or on the internet? I have the same for IRL but the opposite for the internet, as the amount of men on the internet into fashion (on reddit) as opposed to women is a lot more, meaning they are more likely to give good remarks.   E: to clarify. By going on the internet to a fashion based subreddit you are filtering the people you are coming into contact with: (mostly american) people into fashion using reddit. By saying that, let's presume 9/10 is really dedicated into fashion (posts fits at least evey month, participates in discussions/debates, buys clothing on the regular). Of that 9/10, let's say 2/10 would give you personal sound advice. Seeing as the men's sub is bigger, that (9/50) fraction of the sub is more likely to comment on your pic in the largest sub."
TeenMFA,31e2q0,FrogDie,9,Sat Apr 4 12:05:33 2015 UTC,"yeah that's something i noticed, on every online fashion forum that i know of (that isn't dedicated solely to female fashion), there are significantly more males   my friend postulated that its bc females often run their own personal style blogs, and i think i've heard that since they're pressured by society to be into fashion, while men aren't, then maybe males sort of band together and form communities while females don't need to  idk :'0"
TeenMFA,31e2q0,mc-lunar,4,Sun Apr 5 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"honestly i don't understand this, fashion is so personal and that's combined with the sexist outdated notion that women all know how to dress well and guys don't etc etc"
TeenMFA,31e2q0,twinsofliberty,16,Sun Apr 5 01:42:54 2015 UTC,female fashion is different than male fashion
TeenMFA,31e2q0,twinsfan101,12,Sat Apr 4 14:49:32 2015 UTC,I dunno. If you frequent the mfa and ffa subs you will notice that the mfa waywt always gives advice to people while in ffa the replies are always just compliments and no advice.
TeenMFA,31e2q0,Aphlynx,4,Sat Apr 4 20:02:44 2015 UTC,that was one of the reasons i wanted to absorb them. i think that making them post here would give the girls would allow more opinions to come to them
TeenMFA,31e2q0,titaniumwings,13,Sat Apr 4 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"I'd like a redirect, like both subreddits just redirect to a new subreddit, /r/TeenFA. I like the idea, and maybe like a filtering with flair system, so if someone only wants to see male related posts, then they can, and vice versa. And I also agree with /u/Mawrawr. I mean, personally, I dress for the opposite sex, and sharing a subreddit would make their opinion more convenient."
TeenMFA,31e2q0,AlienComingIn,3,Sat Apr 4 06:05:04 2015 UTC,"so, I just created the sub to squat on it. If anybody wants to make something happen, PM me."
TeenMFA,31e2q0,AlienComingIn,2,Mon Apr 6 05:58:38 2015 UTC,This is stupid
TeenMFA,31e2q0,sterling_morrison,24,Sat Apr 4 06:58:54 2015 UTC,"I doubt you, me or 95% of this sub could adequately give female fashion advice. The whole thing would just turn into a circlejerk. There is no need whatsoever.   If you want to interact with females online might I suggest /r/teenagers or Tinder"
TeenMFA,31e2q0,AlienComingIn,6,Sat Apr 4 13:54:04 2015 UTC,Or you could learn how to give advice based on shape and color instead of gender
TeenMFA,31e2q0,Shneap,9,Sat Apr 4 14:09:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying its about gender. There are articles of clothing that I have no experience in, namely skirts, dresses, rompers and all the variations of them. Sure it would be easy if it was just a simple outfit like jeans and a blouse and a jacket but sometimes it isn't."
TeenMFA,31e2q0,dindonfootball,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:33:07 2015 UTC,Just because you personally may not be well versed in ff doesn't mean other members aren't.  Although it is MFA not FFA so I may be in the wrong here.
TeenMFA,31e2q0,AlienComingIn,-4,Sat Apr 4 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Why would it matter what you know about skirts and dresses and rompers? What would you need to know? If you don't have knowledge of those things, you still have eyes that can see a thing and decide if it looks good to you."
TeenMFA,31e2q0,Strange_PhD,5,Sun Apr 5 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"Telling someone that they're outfit looks bad and not giving a proper reason or offering a way to improve is not advice. Having knowledge in the female clothes mentioned, among others, means that if something looked off in an outfit you could comment on a way to improve it."
TeenMFA,31e2q0,taylorswiftqt,-1,Sat Apr 4 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe, I don't know, a joint sub would allow you to learn to judge fashion objectively or learn female fashion so that you might be able to comment and assist in the future? Until you feel comfortable you can always abstain from commenting on a girl's fit. It's not like you must give advice; maybe someone else more knowledgable would be able to. I think the point of this proposition is to make the community a bit larger, seeing what makes a community like this successful is a substantial number of people with similar interests.  I don't really care if the subs combine. I'm just saying, your argument is lacking a bit."
TeenMFA,31e2q0,DrFeatherbottom,4,Sat Apr 4 17:23:46 2015 UTC,suggesting the subs merge so that someone can maybe learn how to comment on outfits isn't a strong argument either.  we have 10k subs. we really don't need a merge and i don't think it would be an upgrade for either sub.
TeenMFA,31e2q0,YEEZY-SZN,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:49:43 2015 UTC,I had this idea 4 months ago and was attacked for it. Good luck
TeenMFA,31e2q0,Xinijia,-3,Sat Apr 4 20:03:02 2015 UTC,I think it would be a good idea as long as everyone had a tag to show if they were male or female. It would clear up confusion in simple questions/ recent purchases etc and would help when commenting on WAYWTs.
TeenMFA,31e2q0,AlienComingIn,10,Sat Apr 4 19:25:12 2015 UTC,I like my flair
TeenMFA,31e2q0,YEEZY-SZN,7,Sat Apr 4 18:33:55 2015 UTC,"You put in so much hard work to get that flair and some guy just wants to label you as ""Female"". What is wrong with this world"

So I doubt people have been paying attention to my posts in GD but heres a summary: part 1, part 2. pretty dramatic conclusion (hopefully) happened last night though.   was hanging out with some friends at a house, when ex starts texting me about how I was a ""selfish asshole"". fuck. she found out about the girl I've been hanging with somehow. after some aggressive texts from her and, she apparently sped off from her house (being pursued by 3 of her friends) and managed to find the house I was at. I walked outside with my friend cause I was taking him home, she walked over and slapped me and yelled  bunch. Then her friends yelled at her to calm down and called her mom. they told me to leave so I peaced out. so yeah. that was some drama. at least now I have a crazy ex-girlfriend story. or am I a dick? was waiting a month not enough time? opinions? sorry for the wall of text lol but wanted to share.  tl;dr, got slapped."

I guess transitions aren't exactly clear in dreams or I forgot it or something haha. I end up in a thread on tmfa discussing something. I can't see any of the comments' content but I see that there's text and the general layout of reddit. I scroll down and discussion starts getting pretty heated, huge text walls start getting put out by all sides of discussion; people are starting to write a lot. then, I see a green name below all of these comments. AutoModerator wanted to get involved as well and spammed huge walls of that weird matrix text in bold, supposedly done by a mod I guess as a joke mocking the huge walls people were writing. idk why I thought this was so hilarious but it was so funny I woke up laughing hard as hell and confused.

TeenMFA,30y2cm,titaniumwings,7,Tue Mar 31 17:23:12 2015 UTC,your jeans are too high and the socks are too dark. go for a neutral colour (beige off white etc etc) for the socks perhaps.  light light blue but it might clash with the jeans idk   pink?

TeenMFA,30pqbl,TheDutchWonder,16,Mon Mar 30 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"I'm stuck in a rut. I've been into grunge and skater stuff, mixed with a little Americana, but I feel like I'm still just a guy wearing flannels and skinny jeans. I still try and stuff, I just feel like I'm going nowhere with my style. Anyone else feel like this ever? How'd you deal with it?  Edit- also I have girl problems. So I liked this girl for about two years, right? I was obsessed. We started spending time together somewhere during those two years, but more as friends. I was fine with it because she's also my best friend. I went through a lot of ""I can't like her anymore"" stages where I tried to quit. Eventually I asked her out, and she said no. This year she started dating a guy, and I basically checked out, it wasn't going anywhere, why would she like me? A couple months later, I'm at Taco Bell with her and she says ""you know, I used to like you."" My mind exploded. But now she had a boyfriend, so I wasn't going to be a scuzzbag and try to break them up. Then they were fighting, so she called me because she didn't really feel like talking to anyone else. I talked with her a couple hours, and she said ""I know I don't have a right to tell you this, but I think all the time about what would have happened if I hadn't said no to you when you asked me out."" And I said ""... Me too."" We didn't talk about it for another couple months and we hung out less and less, which sucks cuz she's my best friend. Then one day I had to drive her home after play practice two days ago and we talked and laughed and as we get to her house, she starts tearing up. I of course ask her why. She looked at me and said ""I know I shouldnt, but I still have feelings for you."" And she gets out of the car. I say ""Allison wait."" (Allison isn't her real name) she looks back at me and says ""no, I cant. I can't talk about this..."" And goes into her house.   So... What the fuck do I do?"

TeenMFA,30pqbl,TheDutchWonder,3,Sun Mar 29 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think just continuing to be who I am with her is the best idea."

There will be other girls, many other girls, 1 girl for 3 years? Was she really worth it for three years with nothing coming to fruition? Obviously no one here knows the situation, we can only speculate from personal experience. Teenage girls, as cliche as it is to say, love attention and being wanted and having a person obsess over them for that long is a pretty big self esteem boost for anyone!(I know form experience). She even admits she doesn't have the right to tell you this! It put's you through more pain and angst over the situation. This situation is not fair on you at all you should treat yourself better.   Everyone here young and should avoid any 'soulmate' thinking. Go meet new people, fuck bitches get money you know the drill haha"
TeenMFA,30pqbl,TheDutchWonder,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:39:09 2015 UTC,"The thing is she's my best friend, I know her better than I know anyone else, and she's not doing it for the attention. But since I'm her best friend, even in the case I decide to say ""too bad so sad"" and date others, that wouldn't cause everything to go away, I'd have to see her and deal with everything. Plus I am happy when I'm with her. She's one of the few people I'm 100% honest with, and I trust her with everything. We share almost everything. I don't believe in soul mates, but out of everyone I've met, she's the person I've most connected to. I also want her to know that I'm not going to be the person who waits for years. That was me before. I just wish I'd know if it was going to happen or I should quit for good. If I give her an ultimatum though, it would force her to make a decision that shouldn't be rushed. And I'm not in a rush to meet new girls or anything, I'm not desperate to get a woman. I'm pretty happy as is. This situation isn't making me miserable, I just wanna know which way this is gonna go.  Haha, I wouldn't mind the get money part though."
TeenMFA,30pqbl,HIYASarge,2,Sun Mar 29 21:45:33 2015 UTC,"Well you do you bro. You say you're happy in this situation but the fact you're asking says otherwise haha. Still, no matter what do you want and think is best for you, that's the best you can do.  Also about your style, why not trying to clean it up? Skinny jeans flannels try and get a cleaner looking style and it'll look more mature. Same staples in your dress style but think about some dress boots maybe? like black chelseas or jodhpurs?"

It sucks man... and I thought I was the only one that had that kind of story. My advice is to hook up with her if you still like her, but keep in mind that she made you ""waste"" a lot of time that you could spent with another girl.
