A big heavy set of wheels and tires will likely be more durable and flexible of course.  If you're planning to ride on road, you should get a bike with road oriented tires, like 700c wheels and 25 to 35 mm wide tires.  Wheel diameter doesn't matter much for efficiency in casual cycling on the road. If you want a bike for touring, get a touring bike or something not so far removed."

What surfaces will you be riding on?  If you are mostly riding on roads and packed gravel, I think a tire without aggressive tread would be much more efficient than the knobby tires on most 29ers.  If you do decide on a 29er, consider getting a frame bag."

Aluminium bike frames from the big manufacturers are usually rated for a load of ~300lbs, but that's just lawyer-speak for a bike that has been engineered to hold a lot more.  Your bike will be completely fine. I'm 240lbs and when I tour I carry 40lbs+ of gear on my rear. I don't like to carry anything on the front, and you don't have to."

If you are willing to spend a grand the Hilleberg Nallo 3 GT comes highly recommended for bicycle touring. The durability of the Nallo and the hydrostatic head is well above that of the mutha hubba. The Hubba series is great for summer touring but at the end of the day there not gonna last forever, I've already had problems with the shock cord inside the poles and I've only been touring with it for a month in a half now.

It's spacious for a tunnel design tent, and because of that design it holds up beautifully in any weather I've experienced so far.   However! The main drawback, and this is a big one for bike touring, is that it isn't free standing. You have to stake in the ends, which means that you can't set up on concrete or rock or very hard ground.  I love everything else about it though."

bicycletouring,3e2h6k,jennytough,2,Tue Jul 21 22:55:07 2015 UTC,"There are so many options of great quality tents. Here are my recommendation:   Where are you based out of, this will affect price. There is no need to buy a tent from across the pond. If you are in the US: MSR, Big Agnes, REI, TNF, etc. If you are EU based: Terra Nova and Hilleberg make great tents as well, but are more tunnel designed. MUST have 2 doors and 2 vestibules(.) A lot of people don't think this is a must, but it is. Besides the ""liveability"" benefits, its more so if you blow a door or fly zipper you still have a functional one. This may not happen the first year or two, but it will eventually no matter how much you baby them. Check pole length and floor durability (or carry cheap plastic) when deciding between models/brands. Next door shape, this has to do with the bends of the zipper, if there are tight bends, it's a no go.  Tents like the Hubba's are lighter in weight due to pole configuration. This keeps the weight down at the cost of wind stability. You want your poles to cross for more stability. Depending on your trip, where, when etc. It might be worth the weight, but I always lean to the lighter weight. I also like 2+ or even 3 person tents for bike trips unless bikepacking. Also I'm not a big fan of the ""Jake's foot"" or other DAC's plastic hubs."

Only recently have things started to wear down, like one of the aluminum poles has a minor crack in it and the elastic in the gigantic single pole is finally starting to get not super taut.

bicycletouring,3e2pnr,dec92010,2,Tue Jul 21 14:34:11 2015 UTC,"Will you be camping or staying in hotels? Japanese hotels don't come cheap, usually 40 USD per night or more. But staying in them does save weight and reduce complexity of your gear. I did it recently, from Fukuoka to Sapporo. In summer you won't need much warm clothing at all, perhaps not even rain gear unless you're on a tight schedule.  What sort of bike will you ride?  A smartphone is highly useful if you don't speak Japanese, because Google Translate works reasonably well in that language.  100 yen shops will sell you lots of useful stuff, so don't bring anything you're not certain you will need. And bike shops are fairly commonplace in major towns."

Other than that, if you find you need something, buy it when you're there. Best to start light rather than heavy. You can buy anything you might possibly need in Japan.

Think about water and food a lot! You need to always be topping up your hydration (Japan won't be so bad). Learn some basic bike mechanics off youtube. Pack quality equipment/clothes, not cheap stuff that will break and weigh more - and you'll have to replace anyway, costing you more in the long run.

They were double the price of the state parks, $12 vs. $6, but they had free showers and a general store with gatorade for sale, which was very welcome since no state parks have anything resembling food for sale. There was mini-golf and a hot tub and it seems like a cool little community if you were there to hang out, I unfortunately was just too tired to do anything but eat and sleep.  Crossing the Golden Gate was really awesome.  This is easily the hardest thing I've ever done. It was my first time in SF, and coming around that final corner and seeing the big red arches for the first time was such a great feeling.

bicycletouring,3e0gyd,mightybird,3,Tue Jul 21 07:39:33 2015 UTC,What did you do to prepare/train? Shorter day tours or just spending as much time in the saddle possible?
bicycletouring,3e0gyd,rickyharline,6,Tue Jul 21 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"Ha. Short answer: Not enough. I'm in Chicago, so there is really no training for the kinds of hills/mountains that you see on the west coast.  I did a decent amount of 40-60 mi/day rides leading up, but it wasn't enough.  I wish I had scheduled differently and aimed for 50-70 mile days instead of 70-90 mi/day.    I did a 4000 mi bike trip from NYC to Portland OR a few years ago, and we averaged 80 mi/day, so I assumed it would be similar, but that trip was supported(a van carried our gear) and I was on a road bike then instead of my heavier touring bike now. I definitely underestimated how heavy dragging 30-40 lbs of gear up the mountains would affect me. My knees were in a lot of pain the last few days of the trip."

bicycletouring,3e0gyd,dweejay,4,Tue Jul 21 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"Worst day - Easy. One of the first couple days of the trip, riding into Elma, WA, I had a 95 mile ride and it got hotter and hotter and ended up being 96 degrees when I finally made it into town. The last hour or two, I couldn't even make it 5 miles at a time without needing to stop under a tree and hang out for 15 mins or so.  Best day - Thats harder. I guess a tie between riding through the redwoods on the Avenue of the Giants, and some absolutely breathtaking coastal views in the early morning near Manzanita, OR"

By the end, I was either buying Subway at the last town and waiting until night to eat it, or making my own PB&J sandwiches. To be honest, it wasn't the most ideal situation. I met a couple other cyclists with small and efficient cooking gear and I kind of wish I had dropped my heavy U-Lock and chain and traded it for a small gas canister, burner, small pot and some pasta and a much lighter lock. I kept an eye on my bike every time I went inside somewhere and no one ever went near my bike, I think the sight of 40 lbs of stuff attached to the back helped them realize how impossible it would be to steal."

bicycletouring,3e0gyd,kmad,4,Tue Jul 21 03:57:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can, but sometimes you might have to get creative. Part of the problem is weather. If it's forecast to rain until noon the next day you can't just sit tight if you're stealth camping.  Churches can be quite accommodating, and a map with BLM land marked is also very helpful.  Washington hills aren't too bad (at least if you go around the Olympic peninsula), they're a good warm up for OR."

Grumpy's in Rockaway Beach is great, and the folks that run it are actually really nice.    Aside from that, don't forget to watch for whales around Depoe Bay.  The only great white I've ever seen was in Port Orford, that was cool.  Fort Stevens is a nice campground, and Warrenton has better grocery prices than Astoria.  And, Aberdeen, it's cool, you know, Nirvana and all, but there are some sketchballs there.  It seemed most of the hotels were run by scammers too.

I wouldn't recommend against it, I just would mostly offer caution.  Especially on weekends, it can be heavily populated with high end sports cars treating it as their personal open course race track.  I have seen one touring cyclist so at his ropes' end over being nearly run off the road repeatedly that he was standing in the narrow ditch, picking up his bike repeatedly and slamming it into the ground.  That was in the area down south of Mendocino."
bicycletouring,3e0qgz,pretzelcrisp7,5,Tue Jul 21 01:48:48 2015 UTC,"Those are not 27"" tires. I can't know for sure but it is extremely unlikely.   You can attempt to swap your bars out for drops but the process will cost you more then that bike was worth new. (in the $400/$500 range for shifters, bars, install labor, tape, new cables new housing, maybe new derailleurs), and it will ruin the geometry of the bike. If you want drop bars you want a new bike. If you want more hand positions...Look up trekking bars or butterfly bars  To me it sounds like you are in way over your head here. You've done some internet research but haven't put your hands on anything yet. My recommendation would be go to a local bike store and pick up some racks, some panniers get a feel for their size and compare that to what you want to carry.   Buy racks if you want them, buy panniers if you want them, just throw on a backpack if that is what you need. Don't buy grips sight unseen; Go try some. Everyone and their mother will point you in the direction of Schwable Marathons.   Every bike is a touring bike if you tour on it.  Touring is not about having the right gear it is about riding places on your bike. I rode with these guys last year for a bit. They were on old ""Ten Speed"" schwinn road bikes, friction shifters rear rack, they camped every night and did 360 miles in 5 days. No fancy gear. Not even panniers."

bicycletouring,3e0qgz,haveyounosense,2,Tue Jul 21 09:16:41 2015 UTC,"Wait -    My budget is ~400$   This bike is only worth about $100-$150 second hand. You could buy a way nicer bike that doesn't need modifying for touring second hand for $400.  Maybe that bike has sentimental value or you 'want to make the most of it' or something, not saying to get rid of it or not ride it again but to recognize that touring bikes have different requirements and it would probably be best to get a completely new bike for touring with your money. If the frame and forks on this were higher quality and very suitable for building up a touring bike it might be arguable it's worth doing, but they aren't.  Spending $400 modifying this would only increase it's value by maybe $100 (because it's still an old Giant Cypress even with new shit bolted to it) and you'd have a mediocre single bike at the end of it compared to the $400 second bike from Craigslist.   As the other poster says you don't need a special touring bike to go touring, and you could tour on this bike, but if you want to spend $400 on improving the bike you have for touring, then a new bike would be the best bet. Though if that $400 includes your budget for buying panniers/accessories rather than just parts for the bike, you might be best off getting kitted out and seeing how much money you have left."
bicycletouring,3e0qgz,miasmic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:07 2015 UTC,"Just add sturdy racks/panniers (that can be transplanted to a new bike, if ever), and you are good to go, sort of. I suggest you start with some weekend (camping) trips, to get a feel for things, (and have 'alternative' transport back home if stuff happens).      If your tires are good, no reason to replace them (but do bring a repair kit), if your bum doesn't hurt, the saddle is already perfect, and if you are not suffering from numb/tingling hands with this setup, no need to replace grips/handlebars.       Toe clips: if you want those, get (very) used/comfortable with them before you add heavy cargo to the bike, as that needs some getting used to as well, and you don't want two 'troubles' at the same time."
bicycletouring,3e0qgz,mrCloggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:46:18 2015 UTC,"Here's my advice (I did about 350 kms in 3 days on a walmart bike, total budget less than 500 CAD). You don't need to buy all sorts of touring specific gear, and don't let your budget (or some of the comments you may get here) dissuade you.   That being said, your budget is low but you can save lots of money by not replacing to drops, and not going crazy with your tires/wheels. I'd say, if you can't do it yourself, go get the bike serviced long enough so that they can fix and replace anything that needs to be done. Avoid all major modifications.  Once serviced and deemed in good working order, just get a few ""comfort upgrades"" on your contact points like a good seat, nicer grips, and I personally loved having bar ends and I LOVED my cheap aero bars (let me get low in the wind and change up my position a bit, which is awesome in the prairie winds we get in my neck of the woods).   I'd also invest in a raincoat, helmet and good cycling gloves, and my god, cycling shorts. My brother went out without a pair, just gym shorts and underwear... the chaffing he had was... it hurt just looking at it. I loaned him my other pair and he covered himself in cream. I also spent money on clipless shoes and pedals, and love them now, but this was a luxury upgrade.  I also just swapped out for some fairly cheap road tires on my 26 inch tires (Tioga City Slickers). They were awesome on the gravel and then pavement I saw.  Front racks with suspension fork may be tricky and i don't have any experience with it. Not sure that's a good idea.  Are you planning on camping? or going into hotels? This will greatly change how and what you will pack, and what kind of panniers you will need to carry:   You could probably get away with just a rear rack and some cheaper panniers for now to keep your costs low. I got some cheap non water proof panniers and just packed everything I had into ziplock bags to waterproof. I'd recommend getting some tools too, so that you can perform road side maintenance. Multi tool with chain tool, tire levers, patch kit, a few extra tubes, lube, hand pump (don't go with CO2 because once you are out of cartridges, it becomes useless). Maybe a few rags. if you are only on the road for a short bit, this should get you you where you need to go.  I also brought electrical and duct tape. See my pic? my biggest encumbrance was for sure my sleeping bag. I could have used something much lighter, and compact, but it's what I had, and I didn't want to buy a new one. I slept in a camping hammock (I already owned this so I didn't account it into my budget). it was awesome cause it packs tiny and you can easily hide in the wild with it if need be.   Any other questions or anything you want me to go in depth with, let me know I will. I am all about the budget touring!  My next attempt (hopefully end of this summer, but I got a new born baby and a three year old, so might not be able to) is to do an ultralight tour on my old ten-speed road bike and cover 500km or more over 3 days."

With Corsica there's a few things worth noting:  1. Wildcamping is heavily fined. I think it was 250 Euros (if you're caught) when we went. Wildcampers set a lot of wildfires, so, they don't like them.     2. Corsica has the most road deaths in Europe, per capita. Some gaudy stat like that. The drivers are horrible and aggressive. Care is needed on the velo.  3. In August (I assume that's when you'd be going) it's incredibly hot. It was 35-40 degrees when we were there. We did some climbing at night to avoid the heat of it.   4. Avoid the middle parts of Corsica..they don't get the ocean breeze and have Alpine-mountain level climbs. The geography of Corsica is very very diverse.  It was the highlight of a great 4 month trip, but the heat and the lack of campgrounds in the northern part of the island put a lot of stress on me and my crew.

The most depressing part of any day during the first couple of days was the end. Setting up my tent. Cooking your food and such. I would always dread that part.   But idk what happened. Things got better, I would listen to audio books and podcasts when the shoulder got better. And before I knew it, I'm nearing the end of the Canadian tour.   I like the person I've become after being on the road alone. I'm way more social, and ask for directions instead of googling. I'm no longer intimidated going people for any social reason.  And even thinking about startng some sort of podcast chatting with homeless people in all the cities I travel through.

bicycletouring,3dyf7j,InspirationalQuoter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:51:08 2015 UTC,Here are some pics  As you can maybe see its not so much the rack that is sagging but the tongue that is attaching it to the seat stay.
bicycletouring,3dyf7j,appletart,4,Mon Jul 20 16:32:21 2015 UTC,"The rack is leaning backwards, so...  1) secure the ""tongue"" to the other side of the brake-bridge (i.e. not sandwiched between the brake and the frame) and pull the rack bolts forward in the tongue until the bolts are clear of the danger zone.  2) Insert the bolts from the bottom-up if you want even more clearance."
bicycletouring,3dyf7j,jeffbell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:00 2015 UTC,Flipping it to the other side caused a clearance conflict between it and the nut for the brake.  Bolts bottom up is a brilliant suggestion. Thank you and cheers!
bicycletouring,3dyf7j,jeffbell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:10:09 2015 UTC,You could also file a couple mm off the ends of the bolts.  Do it with the nut already on the bolt so that it cleans up the threads when you take the nut off.
bicycletouring,3dyf7j,dec92010,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"The clearance is kind of tight, but not much less than the clearance at your rear brake.  Do you have the right rack?  Could it be that you are using a MTB rack over a 700C tire?  I don't think that you need to take stuff out of your load.  The rack should not sag for typical touring loads.  Is the rack bent?  it looks a little like the front segment is bent downward.  The main rack should be straight.  Please note that it is pretty common to have to bend the ""tongue"" of the rack up or down a bit to match your frame size.  The tongue should only be taking care of horizontal positioning of the rack, and not actually carrying any vertical load.  Looking at the photo, I think you could add a slight upward bend about 1.5cm in front of where the slot ends.  Take the tongue off the rack and use a vise.  That will make it much easier to assemble."

bicycletouring,3dyp99,Not2original,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Feeling like a big girls blouse is the least of your worries! Walking a loaded tourer up a big hill is the quickest way to do yourself an injury - your back is twisted at a weird angle so a pulled/strained muscle is possible. Also, your pedals will try their best to take bites out of your ankles and it very quickly gets frustrating (I've had to walk a broken bike up a few massive climbs, and my bike almost didn't survive the ordeal! :/  Few people can get over an Alpine pass in the first week of their tour (I certainly can't!) and even a few hundred metre climb can be challenging. Nobody says you have to cycle up in one go, stop as many times as you need (nobody's watching, nobody cares), but stay in your saddle - just rest until your hearbeat drops, take a sip of water, and plough on. Set yourself a goal ahead (I aim to have a rest at every corner of a switchback, and try to stick to it.   Number 1 rule is that if there's a particularly galling climb on the route ahead then try to climb it early in the morning when the sun's heat and traffic are less."
bicycletouring,3dyp99,appletart,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"I often hop off and push, and don't feel like it diminishes the journey at all. I find there's a point where you're spinning away, it's hot because there's no wind flowing past you, and you have to work harder steering the bike because of the low speed. I just hop off, and walk up for a while until I feel like cycling again, or it's flattened off for a patch. The pedals will catch your shin if you're not careful, but I don't think there's any actual risk of getting injured."
bicycletouring,3dyp99,thisislawrence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"My first time out, this bridge:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane%E2%80%93Africatown_USA_Bridge  got me at about mile marker 10. I was prepared. By that I mean I wasn't. Between my loaded single speed Walmart P.O.S., and my novice endurance, I was walking after about 2/3 of the way up the east-bound ramp. Being in a coastal region, this is likely the biggest thing I'll handle for some time. But I knew i was gonna bike this route, so I left my pride at home. The downhill on the other side was a blast, and the rest of the ride across the pool table flat Causeway easily assuaged any feelings of failure.   I think I'll continue to leave the pride at home."
bicycletouring,3dyp99,bullshitninja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:07 2015 UTC,"Do whatever you feel, I've walked up some hills. It's honestly as hard as riding up most of the time. Your journey is gonna be different from everyone else, try not to put too much stock in everyone's two cents and just get out there and ride and learn from experience. Obviously I'm not advocating never taking advice from anyone but I've come to learn when it comes to cycling everyone thinks they know what's best and think there opinion is the holy word. Handle bar setups, saddles, spd's, routes and which direction you start your tour in and to push your bike not to push, all this stuff is subjective."

bicycletouring,3dyp99,hustinjam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"yep walking is frustrating but I don't mind it usually. it makes getting back on the bike at the top feel great. Sometimes I'll do like 5 minutes walking, 5 minutes riding if it's not incredibly steep.  Steep gravel climbs suck though. Losing traction on the front wheel and falling off while going 2kmh is just crap haha."
bicycletouring,3dyp99,patrickthatsme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:52:19 2015 UTC,"Occasionally get off and push. Never feel less for it.   Generally, I only get off and push if I'm traveling at a speed near to what I could be walking. The fact that it's not much easier + the fact that it's only a small fraction of the total distance I'd be covering means I have exactly zero qualms."
bicycletouring,3dyp99,underscore______,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:14:24 2015 UTC,"There's nowt wrong with it at all, especially if you're prone to knee pain. It does help if you know from experience what the warning signs are if you've hurt yourself before by refusing to stop pedalling.  To get around this I've fitted mountain bike gearing on my tourer and when I'm off to the Highlands my bottom gear is 22-32. Last year I only had to walk once for a couple of hundred yards, halfway through a day's ride as I could feel the pressure building on my knees and I knew they'd temporarily reached their limit. Once I reached the summit I had a 10 minute rest and then carried on for another 50 miles. If I hadn't walked that stretch, past experience tells me there's a good chance I'd have had to stop about 20 miles later and hopped on a train to get home."
bicycletouring,3dyp99,bowak,0,Tue Jul 21 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"I'd rather die than get off my bike uphill. I have done big mountains at 7km/h average though. I would advise getting lower gears, theres very light mountainbike gears that allow you to ride at walking speed."
bicycletouring,3dyp99,Hubertoi,3,Mon Jul 20 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"I have a SWB recumbent, and steep hills are where I wish I could magically make it turn into a diamond frame.  I have the lowest triple set-up that my derailleur can handle and when I'm cranking up a hill at walking speed it gets pretty squirrelly and I usually have to unclip from the pedals for fear that I am going to fall over clipped in.  And then, if I stop, it's a b*tch to get started again.   So that is a big part of the problem.  But it is good to hear that people actually do walk up hills!"

bicycletouring,3dyp99,lshiva,4,Mon Jul 20 20:42:10 2015 UTC,Except for trikes. With them you can just gear way down and go up anything as long as the tires don't start slipping.
bicycletouring,3dyp99,Drunk_Tugboat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"I'm of the same ilk. If you're worried, throw a triple on the front and pedal every inch. By day three your legs will be strong and you'll be flying up the hills. (This is assuming your knees are up to it. Don't hurt yourself, etc., etc.)"
bicycletouring,3dylej,dotcom-jillionaire,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"When you upgrade your wheels you'll also need new brakes, so if there's nothing wrong with your current hubs/spokes/rims then I wouldn't be arsed changing anything.  The Marathon HS420 is an excellent touring tyre and is available in your size."
bicycletouring,3dylej,appletart,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:11 2015 UTC,"This tire rocks. If you are about to ride 10k miles, get the Plus or Mondial. The original is perfect for cross country road touring"
bicycletouring,3dylej,louielouayyyyy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"If you have aluminum 27"" wheels, personally, I'd just keep them.  There's no need to go with 700c when there are plenty of good choices in 27"" tires.  My favorite is the Panaracer Pasela.  Classic gumwalll/skinwall look, available in a ton of sizes, reasonably priced and available as a steel or folding bead."
bicycletouring,3dylej,guy1138,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"+1 for Panaracer. It is after all Panasonic so matches the bike. They make tubes too, which are really well made if you can find them."

I did a bike tour there about a decade ago  (gosh, time flies) and there were some pretty decent campsites along the way. The landscape is really nice and even during the summer it didn't get too hot along the canal. Enjoy your trip!"
