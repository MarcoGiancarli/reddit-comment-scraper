Arcades just aren't a thing anymore in this day and age. It makes me sad."

UMD,3dzq7c,edstaya,5,Mon Jul 20 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"I graduated from UMD two years ago, so I'll give you a little insight :) I lived in the same scholars community (cambridge community).  Cumberland has seven floors and air conditioning from what I remember! Your floor will be split up into a boys and girls side. There will be about 80 people on your floor, 40 of each gender. It'll be nice living on the 2nd floor because you won't have to fight the mass amounts of people for the elevator all the time and can just take the stairs. Cumberland is right next to the ERC (school gym and pool) and a very short walk (about 2 minutes) to the nearest diner. If you're in the scholars community, the scholars classes that you're required to take are just a step outside your door. Let me know if these aren't the types of things you were wondering about, willing to share more!"

UMD,3dzq7c,Chesapeake301,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:55 2015 UTC,"Graduated this year. Parties and social scene depends on your floor mates, mostly. You'll probably have some pregames in your buddies' rooms before you and a group of 40 friends go to the Varsity apartments hunting for parties or to College Ave. for frat parties during Rush Week.   Hopefully you have a floor lounge where you can meet the other people and play Super Smash Bros or watch movies."
UMD,3dzq7c,dtkb29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:56 2015 UTC,"Similar to what has already been said, this will depend a lot on your floor mates. I lived on an amazing floor and I'm still friends with most of them today. The lounge on your floor is a big central meeting point for everyone. It was where everyone would come back after a night of drinking and then more shenanigans would ensue. My freshmen year we drank a lot on our floor. The best way to find parties to go to is by joining a sports club/fraternity/sorority because they have a large amount of parties throughout the year. If you're not interested in that, the most likely place you will go to a party is in one of the off campus apartments like the varsity, the view, etc, or on campus apartments (commons). When I left the bars were very easy to get into with a halfway decent ID."
UMD,3dzq7c,Chesapeake301,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"One of the best things about Cumberland is that you will have a window unit A/C so you can blast it unlike most of the other halls, which have central A/C units with no user controls.  You're in a good spot for the Diner, gym (ERC), football stadium, InCon (convenience store) and near a bus station to take you to the parties.  Enjoy freshman year... I'd give anything to go back!"
UMD,3dzq7c,zelda2077,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"Cumberland hall is on North Campus, next to the football stadium. It is a traditional style residence hall (usually 2 ppl/room, community bathroom) and there are 7 or 8 floors I believe. It is very close to the rec center, which houses the gym, various courts, indoor pool, etc. To get from Cumberland to the student union (Stamp) or the mall takes about 15-20 mins walking. If there's something else in particular you want to know about, I'll try and answer it as best I can."

UMD,3dwij8,cantsingh,2,Mon Jul 20 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"It depends which courses you are referring to - they differ greatly in difficulty. 403 is definitely pretty tough, though. 405 is not as bad, but it is far more difficult than the linear algebra you do in 240.  Regarding distaste for math - I can't say that I blame you. I have a pretty big beef with the way the Calc I-III sequence is structured. Upper level math classes are very different (you actually get to do math). MATH403 is incredibly enlightening stuff. It will make you think about things, like cycles in graphs, in a very different way. It contextualizes these ideas in a more general framework. It's definitely a worthwhile endeavor."
UMD,3dwij8,homeskilled,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:55 2015 UTC,"To expand on this: I got Bs in Calc1-2 honors and Lin alg, and an A in calc3. Here's the 400s I took Math431: geometry. Basically linear algebra 3. Got average of 55 on the midterms, but the professor made our last hw the final and somehow I managed an A-.  Math403: abstract algebra. not a bad class but don't take brosnan. He's hard to follow if it's your first proofs class. Wound up with a c+ even after a 45% average on the midterms. Math406: my favorite math class, number theory. Proofs but pretty easy for someone from comp sci to follow. Got an A- Math463: complex variables. Worst math class, avoid hamiton if you can he's not a bad teacher just hard to follow. He skips a lot of steps. Got wrecked on the midterm (sub 20) but wound up with a C-. B) My advice, if you like math and want a better understanding of some computer science topics, take number theory and as many cross listed comp sci topics as you can. I couldn't take any comp sci ones because I went for the math minor. But if you just want an easy upper level then astronomy sounds good"

At the 100-level, it's two 6 credit classes so it was 90 minutes of class a day freshman year. 200-level was two five credit classes, 2 classes a week, 2.5 hours each for a year. 300-level was more normal, three classes a week 75 mins each for a year. That was all just language classes. After that, I did a conversation/culture class, an online independent study class, and a film class. Those were all normal 3 credit classes. That was the bare minimum to get a minor as well. I came in with pretty much all of my core reqs done via AP, so I basically only took Russian classes, classes for the CS major, and a few random 'that sounds cool' classes."

UMD,3dt3an,khui88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:59:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on the lab and the amount of funding they have. Generally they'll either do it for money, credits, or just so you have experience to put on your resume. My first research gig was unpaid, my current one is paid so it is possible"
UMD,3dt3an,Drayeth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:40:48 2015 UTC,"If it is paid hourly, $10-12 is what I've usually seen. They might have a departmental research fellowship that your professors can apply for to give you funding (EE has one for $5k). It is case by case but there are also institute trends. For example labs under jqi and ipst regularly provide hourly pay while professors under some institutes usually don't pay at all."

UMD,3drbcg,HaveSomeControl,7,Sat Jul 18 18:29:02 2015 UTC,Lived in elkton last year as my freshman dorm. Honestly IMO it's the best north campus housing other than Oakland. It's got the best bathrooms in Denton community. But yea it's got AC and the rooms aren't huge but you can fit a lot of people in them. It's mostly freshman and sophomores. The 24 shop and 251 are right outside so you'll never be hungry. The diner isn't far and neither is the eppley gym.
UMD,3drbcg,shadyboy125,2,Sat Jul 18 18:41:10 2015 UTC,Are the floors mixed between freshman and upperclassman? I had a friend tell me that since I (freshman) was on the eighth floor I would be with Sophomores.
UMD,3drbcg,terp44,2,Sat Jul 18 21:58:35 2015 UTC,Last year the 8th floor was all sophomores. Idk if it's always like that. The rest of the floors are mixed
UMD,3drbcg,shadyboy125,2,Sat Jul 18 23:34:26 2015 UTC,"Denton Community isn't all that hyped up, but I regard them as being the nicest dorms that aren't the 'luxury' dorms like Oakland and Prince Fredrick. Nice bathrooms, AC, great location, including having the 24 shop in your backyard, which is so much nicer than you think. All in all, it's a pretty good setup."
UMD,3drbcg,BLARGHLEHARG,2,Sat Jul 18 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"When I lived in Elkton my freshman year (12-13) it was considered the crack den of North Campus.  They've seriously fixed it up since then.  Re-did the basement, put in air conditioning, and the bathrooms are nice now.  The doubles are actually a pretty decent size.  You're right next to the 24 and the gym, which is also nice.  You also get a nice people watching view of the orange bus stop, which is always entertaining if you're in for the night.  My floor when I lived there was a mixture of freshman and sophomores, as was one other floor in the building.  It seemed to be all freshman other than that."
UMD,3drbcg,angry_scissoring,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"I was there my freshman year too. My room was tiny as fuck but it was a triple so my experience doesn't really speak to the size of the rest of the rooms too well. The location is great for hanging out because of the diner, 24, and the gym but if your classes are on South Campus it kind of sucks. You will definitely have an entertaining time living there. We had some girl get arrested for growing pot in her room and she had to be dragged out by cops; the cops visited a bunch of times actually. All in all it's pretty good. It was really easy to make friends there, all you have to do is hang out in the lounge. My floor became pretty tight knit because of that. You should consider yourself somewhat lucky."

CS/Bio classes are gonna be a bit of a haul, but you'll be alright. The laundry room isn't in the building so you'll have to walk next door to Harford; but the rooms themselves are really nice and the suite set up is cool."
UMD,3dmgjw,EpicPigz,7,Fri Jul 17 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"It's an old building. It's slated to come down in 2020. The rooms aren't glamorous, but if you aren't picky, it's fine. The basement has a fridge, microwave, a ""study"" lounge, and a ""fun"" lounge. Study in the former, have fun in the latter. We played poker, ping pong, watched athletic events, and just chatted there. It's also the best place to cool off; there's a good air conditioner there for early fall/late spring. There's laundry down there, too. No elevators, so you'll have to haul your junk upstairs if you live on the 2nd or 3rd floor. The first and second floors are loud, with plucky and enthusiastic freshmen everywhere. Luckily for me, I lived in the 3rd floor last year, which is singles only. Lots of sophomores and juniors, and we typically aren't bothered by what's going on below us. We go down to see them, while they usually don't go to us. Nobody's in a living-learning program here, it's just a bunch of typical students. And unfortunately, no real AC in here, but the basement's pretty good for cooling off while it's still hot. You'll learn quickly how to use the fan to cool off your room appropriately. Let cool air blow into your room via the window, and shut the window to block hot air during the hottest part of the day.  As a freshman probably living on the 1st or 2nd floor, see if you can befriend someone who lives on the 3rd floor. They can give you tips, tell stories, and provide quiet space to just chill. All in all, it's not one of the ""good"" dorms, but it's yours now, so make the best of it. It's close to McKeldin, so that's good. Compsci, engineering, math, and most science buildings are a bit of a walk, though. It's pretty good real estate otherwise."
UMD,3dmgjw,MelloMathTeacher,2,Fri Jul 17 15:43:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed response.  I will be on the first floor so I guess that is good.  So all 3 floors share the lounges in the basement?  Are there any community areas on each floor?
UMD,3dmgjw,MelloMathTeacher,3,Fri Jul 17 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"All three of the floors share the study lounge, the social lounge, and the laundry room in the basement. No community areas in the other floors. You're living in close enough quarters that your whole floor is a community, and the building is small enough that you will probably get to know a good deal of guys from all floors. Everyone in the building shares the amenities in the basement."

UMD,3dmgjw,EpsilonAI,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"It's shitty because there's no ac. But you'll be fine. I had a couple of friends who lived there last year. HOWEVER, it's close to all of the academic buildings on South Campus.   Have an 8:00a.m. in Van Munching(the business school)? You can leave your dorm at 7:55 and still be on time."
UMD,3dmne7,Ebonyraven,8,Fri Jul 17 14:40:39 2015 UTC,It's not too bad.
UMD,3dmne7,fucboiUMD,7,Fri Jul 17 14:43:35 2015 UTC,I loved Ellicott because I'm lazy as hell and the dining hall is like 10 steps from the back door.   It's a pretty good building for freshmen for its central location and general underclassman vibe. Bring a fan for the beginning and the end of the school year but it's bearable.
UMD,3dmne7,neoqueenie,3,Fri Jul 17 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty solid location, especially for those first few weeks when you're meeting 400 new people. The diner couldn't be closer. As said below, the AC thing is only a problem for 2/3 weeks at the beginning and end of the year. It'll give you a reason to talk to people with AC though, so I didn't mind.  Otherwise, it's pretty standard. Almost all doubles, RA on your floor or the one above, respectable room sizes, and tile floor. I'd suggest an area rug"
UMD,3dmne7,HanaHonu,3,Fri Jul 17 17:21:10 2015 UTC,"lived there as a freshman, the no AC isnt an issue for 99% of the year, it just sucks the first week or two. bring a fan"
UMD,3dmne7,ArcticTerrapin,6,Fri Jul 17 15:07:40 2015 UTC,99% is generous. It's more like 80-85. And that 10% definitely hurts the first and last months. Bring big fans OP
UMD,3dmne7,MilesHighClub_,2,Fri Jul 17 15:33:32 2015 UTC,Which floor are you on?
UMD,3dmne7,AntiGravityTurtle,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"Not that great. It's far away from the academic buildings and is overshadowed by the big, unattractive stadium. There's no AC, and you can't control the temperature of your room--the rooms are way too hot most of the time, even in the winter (open the window). There are mice and cockroaches, but you'll probably run into these critters in every dorm. Hopefully you're in Gemstone; otherwise, you'll have limited access to the Gemstone suite. The railings on the lofted beds are pretty shitty, so people sometimes fall off. It's noisy during lacrosse games (etc.) which can make studying difficult. It's true that Ellicott is right next to north campus diner, but south campus diner is better. Overall, I would not recommend."

UMD,3dmjvi,terp44,4,Fri Jul 17 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"I lived in Old Leonardtown my freshman year. You have the benefit of your own kitchen, and a bathroom you share with 4-6 roommates (maybe 2 if you have 2 bathrooms in your unit). It is not the same experience as having a floor of friends like most freshman, but I was (and still am) really close with my roommates. We also befriended some of our neighbors, most of them were sophomores and juniors. Also, its way easier to drink than it is in dorms- you have space and we befriended a lot of RA's who would just give us a warning if things got too loud. My roommates and I were all in state so we had a lot of friends from high school that lived on north campus. We would always invite them and their new friends to pregame at our place, since it was bigger than their dorms and close to the bars. It was a great way to meet new people and stay in touch with friends.  The walk across frat row  isn't bad (assuming your classes are on the mall), its also much closer to the metro, most of the bars, and restaurants and such. There's also a small shop, laundry, and place to study in this little community center (i forgot what its called). Also. I would get a limited meal plan since you wont be going to the diner as much. The ERC is kind of far, but really not that bad a walk. I used to work there, so I walk from Leonardtown 2-3 times a week. At night and on the weekend, theres a bus that comes to Leonardtown (this may have changed). Ritchie Coliseum is the closest gym, its not as great as the ERC but it will get the job done.  Overall I had a great experience there, and had some of my most cherished memories. I think you will love it!"
UMD,3dmjvi,Aloroto,4,Fri Jul 17 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"Like /u/Aloroto said, it would not be the 'typical' freshman experience, but I think it has its benefits too. You'd be a 15ish minute walk to where most of the freshman dorms, diner, and ERC are. Probably a 10ish walk to the south campus dorms, diner, and buildings.  There's another gym down there, so you wouldn't really have to go to the ERC, and the south campus diner walk really isn't bad.  Your freshman friends would probably be jealous because you'd have a cooler set up, really no RA, and you're closer to the parties; but I'll admit it might be tougher to meet as many people outside of the traditional dorms. I met many by joining groups and in class, so it's not totally necessary, but the dorms are a fun place too. Honestly, you can't go wrong and your year should be blast regardless, it's just about what you're looking for."
UMD,3dmjvi,HanaHonu,3,Fri Jul 17 17:31:58 2015 UTC,I lived out of state so it definitely was harder to meet people and even a year passed I still don't have many friends... But maybe cuz I just smoked all the time instead of looking for friends outside

I see that some days, you have a massive gap of time in the middle.

UMD,3df61h,emma-yo,16,Wed Jul 15 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"Campus life at UMD, because it is an extremely big school, is pretty diverse and I have yet to find someone who could not find something they liked if they were looking for something to do.  Club wise, because you're coming in second semester your going to miss the first look fair were everyone gets to see and, if they want, sign up for clubs and other activities.  However, that does not stop you from looking up and joining clubs, which you can do for most clubs at anytime.  Take a look at this website to see the different student clubs http://orgsync.umd.edu/browse_student_organizations  For Sports, UMD basketball is in full swing in the spring with both the men's and women's teams being some of the best in the country (the men's team is actually one of the favorites to with the national championship and the women are primed to win the conference championship again).   Along with that, both men's and women's lacrosse teams are among the best in the nation and baseball is getting up there as well.  Those sports are all just in the spring semester.  When fall comes about Football is always a good time.  Going to a Maryland sports game, especially a rivalry basketball game, is a must have experience.  If you want to play a sport, intramural teams are widely available to join and, if you're really good, there are several club teams as well.  Just look them up online if you have a chance though you may not be able to access them unless you are a registered UMD student.  In terms of parties and entertainment, UMD has plenty of both.  If you like parties, umd has a relatively large frat scene were there are plenty of parties to find.  If you're a girl you can really get in at anytime and, if your a guy, you can get in some times depending on different factors.  Plenty of other clubs and organizations have their own parties as well (marching band, comedy groups, SGA, intramural/club teams, etc.) which, in my opinion, are much better than the frat parties and you can normally get in easily.  If parties are not your thing, there are plenty of free shows happening on campus all the time.  Student Entertainment Events will normally show movies on the main green (known as the mall) and sometimes they can get comedians to come to campus.  There is also Art Attack (bands come to campus) and Maryland day among other things.  Best of all though, you can take a free bus to the metro station and get down to DC pretty quickly.  There are always things going on in DC plus it's fun just to go around and explore.  As for the people, UMD is extremely diverse and your going to run into people from very different places and may run into people who have the exact opposite mindset that you have.  That said, most people are extremely friendly and are more than willing to help if you ask for it, plus it's a great experience to meet people from such different backgrounds.  Your going to meet some unpleasant people of course but, really, unpleasant people are everywhere, though, in my opinion, there are less of them at UMD.   As for housing, they just changed the system a bit so I'm not exactly sure how the decision as to where you will be put will happen.  As for location however, there are two main parts of campus, South and North.  North campus is the big high rises where everyone who lives there is almost exclusively a first year.  There are some older students but very few comparatively.  The dorms are not the nicest but everyone will be relatively new there so it would be a good place to meet new people.  South campus are mainly the 2nd year students who live in the dorms and 3rd and 4th year students who live in on-campus university affiliated places like the Commons apartments.  The dorms, with with some exceptions, are normally nicer than the ones on North campus.  It's a little harder to meet people because everyone is more established but you'll still meet plenty.  Can't really say which housing is best, I know people who prefer both, so I don't think you can really go to wrong with either.  UMD really is a good place for international students to study.  I've meet plenty of people from all over: Japan, China, UK, Australia, France, Brazil, Argentina, Egypt, New Zealand, etc.  The university may be large, but, it can be made to feel small, especially when you get to become friends with a few people and get involved in a couple of things.  As DC is also such an international city, there are plenty of cultural events going as well which are unique experiences in themselves.  Hope that helps and go Terps!"
UMD,3df61h,The_Zephyro,5,Wed Jul 15 22:52:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! Sorry I should have been clearer,  because the academic year is different in NZ, I'll be starting in your first semester (July/August) but the second semester of the year in NZ :)  It sounds like such a great school! Would you say there's a big sense of community there?  Also so do most older students (e.g third years) live in apartments then?  Thanks again so much, this was super helpful!!"
UMD,3df61h,The_Zephyro,6,Wed Jul 15 23:50:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's a lot better then as you'll be coming in with a ton of new students (easier to meet people) and you'll get to go to the first look fair.    There is a huge sense of community at UMD.  All you need to do is go to a sports game (The Crew for the Soccer games, the huge crowd at football games, the experience of an important men's basketball game, etc.) and you will see how much everyone is into Maryland as a community.  You don't need to go to a sports game to see this either, people wear Maryland stuff all the time (everyone has at least 5 or so free UMD shirts).  Basically everyone loves UMD and, if you go there and cheer for the terps, you'll be welcomed with open arms.  If this helps at all, say you hate Duke, UNC, Virginia, and, I guess, Penn State and you'll get along with everyone else just fine.  Along with UMD as a whole community, there are small communities like that exist within the different majors and other larger organizations that really can help the university feel a little smaller and more intimate.  As for the apartment situation, there has been a big move by the university to only have 1st and 2nd years living in the dorms on campus so most 3rd years and above either live in apartments or houses.  The only on-campus apartments are the Commons apartments which are almost entirely 3rd and 4th year students.  Beyond that, there are plenty of options right off campus for 3rd and 4th years like Knox Towers, Courtyards, the View, and the Varsity which are all apartments and then there are plenty of house right off campus or in the area behind frat row where a lot of students live.  As your new, I'd recommend staying on campus if you can as it is a lot easier to meet people plus it is a lot easier to get to all the sports games and other cool events that are happening all around campus."

Maryland is a great school for sports, the party scene is pretty good, and you are only a brief public transport trip away from Washington D.C., which has endless opportunities.

UMD,3df61h,ericmm76,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"You will probably be extremely popular. Everyone loves New Zealander accents, and actually a significant portion of UMD students go to NZ to study abroad and they all come back raving.   I think it would be a great place. There's all kinds of sports, we've had people from all over come to both Fencing and Environmental Clubs and they seemed to have a blast. You speak the language as well, which will make things even easier.   Obviously you need to internalize that you won't be able to drink legally here, which might be a bummer, but you will probably be able to find plenty of parties.  I don't know exactly which on-campus housing would be best, but it's really interesting to summer here (which we are doing right now) and if you do stay here it might be an incredible opportunity to explore the local area if you're looking for a few slices of Americana. Obviously there's DC to explore, and MD areas like Baltimore, Annapolis, the MD and Delaware beaches, Virginia areas like the Shenandoah, Luray Caverns, on and on.   In terms of friendliness, there's obviously kind and mean people all over. ""Greek life"" is absolutely not up my alley so I won't speak to it so much, but you won't lack for socializing if you'd like it.   Get a bike if you can, or I think you can rent bikes for seasons/semesters, since that will help you get around a lot.   If you have any other kinds of questions please do not hesitate to ask."
UMD,3df61h,HanaHonu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"I think there were some great answers below, they covered a lot of it. I'm assuming that you're looking at other schools in the area as well, and I think UMD might have an edge over a lot of them. I think the connection to Washington DC is a huge plus; we have a strong international presence already due to our proximity and it is an extraordinary city to visit, especially as an international student. I think that connection could outweigh similar schools like UNC or UConn, or even UVA which are a little more isolated. I personally really like how everything at Maryland is kind of all in one place. While it is large and there are plenty of natural spaces, it is all together, rather than spread out at like a UD.  There are some other schools, maybe Rutgers or Georgetown, that have pretty nice locations as well, but I think UMD's community is unique in that it has everything you could look for in a University, along with great academics, though I don't know what you'll study.  As for housing, that's a little tough to say without knowing what you're looking for. But I'd probably ask about the North Hill residence halls if I were you.

UMD,3dfjho,JosephlittleTM,8,Wed Jul 15 21:39:47 2015 UTC,"Laptop theft, if you're careful, is not common. Essentially, don't leave it unattended in a public area. If you're throwing a party, lock it up/ put it somewhere where people won't find it. Do that and you'll be good. Don't do those things and that's where you may run into problems. But if you don't mind me asking, why do you want a high-end laptop?"
UMD,3dfjho,scribbles21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:46:02 2015 UTC,So I can sell my old desktop and continue doing the things I used to do (gaming mostly).
UMD,3dfjho,scribbles21,3,Thu Jul 16 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"Thought that might be the case because I considered doing the same thing last year when I went to school. My recommendation would be, keep the desktop, buy a cheaper laptop, give it a semester, see how much you game, then decide on the high end laptop. A lot of people come to college and really slow down with the gaming. I built myself a real nice new rig like 6 months before leaving for freshman year and by the end of the first semester I had already sold it. Most of my friends that I used to game with also slowed considerably or stopped all together by the end of the first semester. There's so much to do at UMD so you might find yourself spending all of your free time on other activities with very little time for gaming. I know this isn't the advice you asked for but it's something to think about that could end up saving you a bunch of money."

I would say buy what you want and just don't leave it unattended, even for a brief moment.  Another suggestion would be to record the wired and wireless mac addresses on your laptop; I know they can be changed, but the thief would actually have to turn on the PC and get into the operating system to do that.  Anyways back to the mac addresses; One of our student workers got her macbook stolen but the thief used it on campus.  We saw her mac address on the wireless network and got the campus police involved; our student got her laptop back."

Alternately, you can ask the counseling center for an outside referral to another mental health professional. You should know that psychologists cannot prescribe medication, but psychiatrists can."

UMD,3de3t3,Spoot111,2,Fri Jul 17 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"Going off of what /u/personal-suffering said, that's not true for everyone. Anti-depressants when given to you at the wrong dose can cause major drowsiness or that ""zombie-like"" feeling. If you do go on medication and experience that, tell your doctor and he or she will give you a different dosage or a different medication completely.   As far as actually seeing someone about being put on medication, try going to the medical center. Often, the psychologist at the counseling center will refer you to a psychiatrist at the medical center, but if they aren't, try making an appointment yourself. I suffer from severe anxiety (and have for my entire life, so I've been through it all), and when my counselor suggested I try some medication, the medical center was booked for months so I looked for an off-campus office. If you have health insurance, you can contact your insurer and they will give you a list of offices that accept your insurance in the College Park area.   Also, don't throw out the idea of talking to a counselor. I know it may seem as though it doesn't help, but this is because it's not an immediate fix. It takes time to talk about your issues and see what you can do to make your way towards self-improvement. Medication isn't an over night fix, either. Many of them take several weeks to kick in. So ,don't feel like medicine is your quickest and only hope. Often times, a combination of counseling and medicine is the best way to feel better.   I hope this helps!"

So it's not so flexible if you're the type of person who has a lot of ""last minute"" things pop up.

You'll just be spending money but not getting any closer to your degree. So here's what you do: you email the professor and ask if it's cool if you sit in.   Or you don't email the professor and still sit in. You're basically guaranteed two cases: either the professor doesn't notice you or they don't care and will let you stay. Kind of a win-win and you save money.   You can even do the homework by talking to someone in the course and getting it from them.

CLRS is the textbook, but check the other book listed on web-page, that might help. This class is mainly focus on analysis and interesting problem, so that's what you should work on. 3/ Don't skip the class. Try to understand what Prof. Kruskal is teaching. 4/ Don't ask for what you don't deserve. Mid-term and final are the huge part of the grades (90%), so you need to work hard to survive, not by asking TAs for extra points.

UMD,3d67wv,umdtoucla,2,Tue Jul 14 03:43:03 2015 UTC,Don't know about a bus but the MARC train runs from Frederick to DC. Then you could take the metro from a train station to College Park.
UMD,3d67wv,frigginjensen,6,Mon Jul 13 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"Just to expand on this: You can purchase a ticket straight for College Park from Frederick. Transferring lines is doable provided your ticket says ""Frederick"" AND ""College Park"" on it. If you plan on doing this for the whole semester, save money and sign up for ""Student Advantage"" and use monthly tickets rather than single tickets.  What you do is take the(Brunswick line) train from Frederick, pull into DC, then hop onto a Camden Line train to College Park with that same ticket. However, the only reliable way to do this is to take the train that leaves Frederick at 5 in the morning. If you take the 6:05 train, you'll only have four minutes between its arrival and the departure of the last Camden train of the morning. If there's even a slight delay, you'll probably miss it. If that happens, just take the metro from Union Station to College Park. If you think you can get up wicked early in the morning to do this, do it. Otherwise, just take the train to DC and metro the rest of the way. Here's some links for more info:  MARC train: http://mta.maryland.gov/marc-train  Brunswick Line Schedule: http://mta.maryland.gov/sites/default/files/Brunswick_Jan2015.pdf   Camden Line Schedule: http://mta.maryland.gov/sites/default/files/CAMDEN_Mar2015.pdf  Hope this helps!

UMD,3d6hse,hexabyte,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:02 2015 UTC,"MATH115 is Precalc. MATH113 is College Algebra/Trigonometry.  Alternatively, there's MATH015 (Algebra for Precalc). I took this course after struggling with a module on the placement test and met with an adviser who recommended this course. Your mileage may vary when meeting with an advisor. The first month or so reviews high school Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, and Trigonometric basics -- you meet in class everyday Mon-Fri. This type of class typically has fewer than 20 students, so you have more teacher-student interaction/attention. Then there's a review test after that first month and, if you pass, the class becomes a special section of MATH115 -- or you can place into special sections of MATH110, MATH111, or MATH113. Depends on what MATH course(s) your major requires for graduation."

UMD,3d68nz,wafflepouch,2,Mon Jul 13 21:43:21 2015 UTC,Moses requires a lot of work for 393. He's a good prof but if you're already worried it may not be a good idea.
UMD,3d68nz,TheIllogical,2,Tue Jul 14 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"420 and 430 are both project-heavy classes that'll have you coding a ton outside of class (especially 420 with Meesh... get ready to write a ton of code from scratch), so I wouldn't recommend adding 456. You're already going to be doing a ton of work between 393 papers and CS projects, so I'd even suggest swapping out 405 for an easier gened credit or dropping it altogether.  I took 430 with van Horn last semester and found it pretty fun, although the projects could be a little daunting at first. Having OCaml as the class language definitely helped with completing the projects, as parsing/compiling work lends itself really well to a functional language. If Foster has the class doing the projects in Java or something, you might be in for a rough ride.  420 is just a ton of work, period. I took it 2 years ago and the 3-part project easily ate up 100 hours of my time through the semester. Honestly though, once you get the gist of quadtrees, and assuming you have a well-designed system, it's not so much difficult as tedious to implement until part 3. Unfortunately, this means that even if you're a genius at quadtrees, there's no way to make the work go by faster... unless you're also a freak at typing.  393 totally depends on the prof teaching, but it's almost always a fair amount of work. You'll probably be writing multiple papers through the course of the semester, culminating in a large final research project. When I took it with Orel, I think the final project was 20 pages, and there were all sorts of 3- and 5-pagers spread throughout the semester."

Do note that this was with Prof. Chimiak.  The course is super easy. I took it last semester, and had a total of five homework assignments, each took 1-2 hours to complete. There were two projects in the class, each took about 2 hours to do. Look up her past exams on the Math Testbank. For us, there was a page of definition matching, a few pages of multiple choice, a page of spot the error in the code, and a page of interpreting SAS output.  As far as prepping ahead of time, be comfortable with the parametric methods that are taught in STAT401 (t-tests, confidence intervals, ANOVA, OLS). Also, look into the book titled ""The Little SAS Book"". It is much better than the one used in the course, and will help get you familiar with SAS syntax (P.S it's quirky af).  A ton of people ended up skipping the course about half way through the semester, as she posts all of her powerpoint slides online. She did, however, do extra credit for students who did show up to class about 3 times last semester. Hope this helps!  Also, you'll take a lot more from the course if you practice the methods taught on real data sets! Plenty can be found freely online, and are easily read into SAS OnDemand (provided a small enough file - so no data sets over a few megabytes!)."

UMD,3cynbr,ScaryFaces,7,Sat Jul 11 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"Take MATH-141. You will recall the memory while taking the class. Also,the book is the same for MATH-140, and you can also use it for MATH-241, so you can use it as a reference to review the material from calc I."
UMD,3cynbr,hphong591992,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:32:13 2015 UTC,Yes.  Do not take math140.  Its a waste of a semester if you scored a 5 on the AP exam.  Try to run through your old calc book for a refresher and you will be fine.
UMD,3cynbr,theseldomreply,2,Sun Jul 12 15:14:42 2015 UTC,"TAKE 140! I was in the same situation as you, and although once I started re-learning the stuff in 140 I remembered what I had learned previously, I would not have been able to do that in 141, and I would have suffered greatly in 141. If anything, 140 for you should be a great review and way to boost your GPA"
UMD,3cynbr,amarras,2,Thu Jul 16 01:15:55 2015 UTC,"Take MATH141!  I took AP Calc AB in my senior year in high school  and got a 5 on the exam; however, unlike your situation, my adviser did advise that I take MATH141 my first semester. On the flip side I was hesitant to take it. I did take it for the following reasons:   MATH140 is not as hard as MATH141, but it's no pushover either. Taking MATH140 could put you in the dilemma of struggling with a class you could have already had the credit for. I was afraid of this, and upon hearing from a former classmate (who got a 5 on the AB exam) say that she was struggling with MATH140, I was relieved that I decided to take 141. Contrary to popular belief, MATH141 borrows more from Pre-Calc (MATH115), then it does MATH140. In fact, some Calc 2 professors give a Pre-Calc quiz in the beginning of the semester to guage everyone's knowledge, but not a Calc 1 quiz. MATH141 being a weed out class has the benefit of significant curves. This is dependent on your professor, but I'm pretty sure each professor gives a suitable curve. Now depending on your major or your intended major you would either need a C- or B- to pass MATH141. I was trying to get into the engineering school at the time so I needed to pass with a B-. I passed with a B, which was a close call, but this scenario is dependent on your major situation."

UMD,3cynbr,Wolabe,5,Wed Jul 15 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"141 is a weed out class, unless you feel really really confident in your calc abilities i'd take 140 again."
UMD,3cynbr,umdtoucla,3,Sun Jul 12 06:01:37 2015 UTC,"So you took AB your junior year, but haven't taken a math class since. Your memory of the subject is hazy, which indicates to me that you haven't practiced or reviewed the material much since then. Allow me to provide my personal take.   I don't know what kind of high school you attended, so I don't know how rigorous calc AB was at your school. I'm going to make an assumption here: your AB class was a year-long course. I also took a calc course(honors level, not AP, but the class used some AP materials) my junior year of high school: I benefitted TREMENDOUSLY from the review.  Let me set the record straight: MATH140 and MATH141 are both difficult classes. There's no doubting that. However, gaining a refresher from 140 will be a huge benefit to you. Not only that, but; heed this; while 140 is challenging, MATH141 is INCREDIBLY difficult. It briefly made me reconsider my math major. I'm. Not. Even. Kidding. It is so poorly taught and extremely rigorous that you absolutely do NOT want to dive into UMD mathematics with such a difficult starting place, particularly while you're attempting to recall/relearn the important concepts and procedures in AB/140.   You might be thinking, ""It's the same stuff, how much harder can it be?"" If you went to as mediocre a high school as I did, then I can guarantee that both 140 and 141 will make your high school calc class look like child's play. Don't forget, the material will be covered twice as fast as it was when you were in high school(one semester vs. one academic year, again, going on the assumption mentioned above).  TLDR: Take your advisor's advice. They know what they are talking about. Take 140. 141 is incredibly hard and trying to relearn the basics of calc in the middle of it is masochistic. Don't do it. The only way to get good at math is to PRACTICE it. Practicing 140 stuff, which should come to you without too much difficulty, as well as working on your work ethic and adjusting to the rigors of UMD, will prepare you for the difficulties to come. Oh, and read professor reviews. Check out OurUMD and RateMyProfessor. It could save you a lot of trouble if you avoid a particularly bad instructor or get a really good one.  One more thing: Not all UMD math is as hard as I'm making it seem. 240, 241, and 310 are easier than 141. I thought that 241 was even easier than 140, though of course that depends on being comfortable with 140 material. 140 and especially 141 are weed-out courses in their purest form.  Sorry if I scared you a little bit, but I'm going off my experience. Yours could be quite different. Everyone else's is almost certainly different. Good luck, and welcome to UMD! :)"
UMD,3cynbr,MelloMathTeacher,2,Sun Jul 12 03:09:36 2015 UTC,"Quick question... how the hell did you find 241 easier than 140? As someone who was able to breeze through 140, and get by okay in 141, but just not understand 241... HOW?"
UMD,3cynbr,amarras,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:18:09 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, part of it was my instructors. My professors for 140 and 141 were terrible. Justin Wyss Gallifent, who primarily teaches 241, is the MAN.   Not much of 241 relies on 141 material, so that's good. The early material in 241 wasn't too hard to wrap my head around. Later on was just knowing which integrals and derivatives to perform, being meticulous about them, getting the coordinate changes down pat and practice, practice, practice. It's a little difficult to wrap your head around the stuff in 241, I can imagine, but the procedures themselves aren't too complicated in my opinion, assuming you've got a good grip on basic integrals and derivatives learned in 140(and a bit of 141). It's important to keep the variables straight.   Another thing is mathematical maturity. I entered UMD thinking I was good at math. Struggling through the 100-level math courses gave me a SERIOUS reality check. UMD math doesn't screw around. I can imagine someone breezing through 141 if(and only if) they mastered the material in high school, and then hitting a brick wall in 240(linear algebra; that stuff can get confusing) or 310(proof writing; a totally different beast in math from what most people are used to). Me? Once I got through 140 and 141 I was a MUCH harder worker than I ever have been in my life, and it paid off in the intermediate courses. Now let's hope it can help me through the 400-level math courses...  Once again, the experience varies from person to person."

UMD,3cynbr,HanaHonu,0,Thu Jul 16 17:32:19 2015 UTC,"Math141 is a weed out class, and it's pretty difficult.  If you want to refresh your calculus skills, try auditing Math140.

Since you already have credit for Math140, it's kind of a waste to worry about getting letter grades and studying for exams in that class."
UMD,3cwyn3,moonbootsx,2,Sat Jul 11 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"Overall, from the information you provided, I'd say your chances are pretty good.  3.9 unweighted gpa is excellent, though it does depend on how rigorous and challenging your high school's is seen to be.  What level of classes did you take: regular, honors, IB, etc?  That will probably influence the decision more.  1970 SAT is pretty good as well so I wouldn't worry about that.  You can of course try to get it higher if you believe you can but, if not, you should be fine.    For ECs, VP of a student council plus a journalism award are both excellent.  Not having any work/volunteer experience definitely isn't ideal, however, I know plenty of people that didn't have much of either and were accepted.  If you spent most, if not all of your high school years in a small town in Saudi Arabia, then that may give you a slight pass in the volunteer experience department because, though I don't know the volunteer opportunities in Saudi Arabia, I doubt they are neither as plentiful nor widely available as they are in the States.  Again on the Saudi Arabia front, though you said you are not an international student, UMD is really into diversity so having spend some time living in a different country will definitely help.  Hope that helps"

As for not being able to take the tests and the gender/not Saudi issue, one thing that I've found UMD to be, another reason why I love it so much, is that the university is very understanding of those things because of how diverse the pool of students are.  If you make it clear to the university of not being able to take the AP tests due to the cost (I know several people who had the same issue) and how being female and non-Saudi extremely limited an already limited number of volunteer/work opportunities, they will be very understanding and it won't really count against you.  In talking to one of the admissions people when I was applying, she put it best in that, to give yourself the best chance to get into any university, just do the best you can in whatever your situation is.  As you had/have those limitations in your situation, they will take that into account.  On the program front, yes it can effect your chances by quite a bit.  However, that only applies to certain programs.  The two programs that are notorious for being the hardest to get into are the Engineering Program and the Business School.  Others are more difficult as well but not as much as those two.  What program are you thinking of applying to?"

UMD,3cm67y,subieguy07,2,Thu Jul 9 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"I'm in University Honors, but a number of my friends are in ACES and I'd be happy to discuss what I know about it.   How is it?   I've heard good things, mostly. It's still very new, but lots of opportunities (internships, research, etc.) are available.   Is it like a major or can you still be in your major and be apart of ACES? For example, could I take CompSci and study in ACES simultaneously?   Most of the people I know in ACES are Computer Science or Computer Engineering majors, although there's definitely no requirement to be in either of those. I wouldn't say ACES is ""like a major""; a look at the ACES website has some more information on what you get out of doing ACES.  As an honors program, ACES doesn't supplant your major; completion of the program should grant you an Honors Citation (in ACES I) or simply some neat opportunities (if you do ACES II without ACES I, I believe). So you need to have a major; if you get an Honors Citation, it's just something extra noted on your transcript. (You also get to wear special cords at graduation, if that's your thing.)  Hope this helps, and good luck!"
UMD,3cm67y,mfarco,2,Thu Jul 9 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"ACES is kind of like a minor. I just finished ACES I, and that was 14 credits, and your average minor is around 18 credits. In other words, you absolutely can, and are expected to, major elsewhere in the University.  The majority of ACES students are CompSci and CompE, as /u/mfarco mentioned, but that's far from a requirement. I'm an electrical engineer, which isn't too far off from CompE, but it's still different from the norm. My last group project in ACES I worked with a math major and a government major. There's a pretty decent mix.  As far as my opinion on it: it was okay. I was in the first class, so things were pretty experimental with us. I didn't learn all that much in the classes, to be honest. Probably doesn't help that I don't want to go into cybersecurity, though. The ACES label on my resume got me noticed by a couple of companies though, and it probably helped me land an internship this Summer. I also got some research experience with a professor last semester, which was pretty cool.  ACES II you can hop into you junior year, regardless of if you take ACES I or not. So, at the very least, you have that option if you decide to opt-out of ACES I.  Feel free to shoot me any other questions you have!"

UMD,3cm67y,pahoodie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"ACES I is an Honors College program (not a minor), it is 2 years and you will learn introductory cybersecurity concepts, both technical and nontechnical. This Fall, it will be the third cohort of ACES I students. ACES I is meant to complement your major, regardless of what it may be (Criminology, Business, Engineering, Psychology, Chemistry, or Computer Science). You will find that about half of the program are Computer Science majors, a quarter are Engineering (mostly Computer Engineering), and the rest are a combination of mostly Business majors and others like the ones I mentioned in the parentheses. So yes, you can be taking CS and ACES simultaneously and that is exactly what I did. :)   ACES II is a potential minor running out of the Honors College that you start your junior year, something along the lines of a minor in Applied Cybersecurity. The details of ACES II is not exactly concrete yet and will be developing throughout this summer. This Fall will be the first time ACES II will be running.   May I ask your background? So I can answer more specifically. Are you a rising high school senior or a incoming freshman?"

It was an absolutely fantastic experience and I highly recommend going if you can.  However, the various winter programs are very different.  The program that I went on was more unstructured and more focused on learning through meeting people, visiting different locations, and having free time to go around the various cities.  On the other hand, my friend who was on the Rome trip said he had 5-6 hours of classes a day and then free time to plan what they wanted to do.  For New Zealand, the people I know who went there loved every second of it, same with the people I know who studied in Copenhagen (they actually had time to go to Amsterdam/The Hague and said it was awesome).  If you can, talk to the people who run the programs and see whether it will be more of a traditional learning experience (classes) or more unstructured/nontraditional like I had.  Personally, I think the more nontraditional is better because we had more time to really get out into the country, meet people, and experience a different culture.  We still had stuff planned of course, but you don't want to travel to a foreign country to just spend a ton of time in a classroom.  As for cost, most of the programs vary within about $1,000 of each other, the European ones being more expensive normally.  The Netherlands is an expensive place as well, New Zealand less so but definitely not cheap.  The amount of money you spend there depends on you though as by just paying for the program you should have all your necessities. I do recommend not being to frugal though.  I know you said you want to keep costs low, but, you're in a foreign country (that I'm assuming you haven't been to before).  If there is a time to wander about and spend a little extra on exploring and having a fun experience, studying abroad is it."
UMD,3ch28z,The_Zephyro,2,Tue Jul 7 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"Studying abroad is just so expensive for what it is. If you need the credits anyway, go for it. Whatever. It's an awesome time and hell, easy credits. But if you just want the experience I recommend getting a buddy or two and just going to Europe after graduation. It's WAY cheaper to do it this way. Why waste time/money for a class if you really don't need the credits? I also did a volunteer trip to Thailand for 5 weeks after graduation that was way cheaper than a winter session I was looking at while at UMD."

New Zeland program does cost a lot and one of my friend(who went there 2 years ago winter term) told me that website says ~7k for trip but it really ends up 9-10k with other activities and stuff. but anyways if you go to program in south america or north america, it will be cost efficient. Asia is not too bad either. Europe and Australia runs about ~5k or more (of course you can visit more counties if you do europe and if you get chance/want to) for winter term. message me if you have any more questions. *i havent searched spring term. its all winter term talk."

UMD,3ch28z,Prenomen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:00:42 2015 UTC,"You should talk to a peer mentor in the Education Abroad office in Susquehanna Hall. Depending on if you're in state or out of state and if you have scholarships/financial aid it is often cheaper to do a whole semester rather than a winter/summer program. The primary reason for this is that winter/summer classes are always an additional expense and many of the scholarships that you can apply for exclude programs that are this short.   If you are in-state: You can go abroad on an exchange program for the cost of your normal tuition, so normal in-state tuition and the only additional expenses would be housing/flights. Scholarships/financial aid all apply as well! And if you go to a country with a lower cost of living you may even spend less than you do here!   Out-of-State:  There are many affiliate study abroad providers that offer programs for less than your normal out of state tuition. So you may actually be saving money by going abroad during the normal semester! Once again financial aid/scholarships apply to this and additional expenses are usually airfare/housing (although some programs include housing in the program cost). Check out USAC and CIEE as some of the more affordable options.   Obviously, you may have class requirements that make it so you can't go for a whole semester, but just as a general FYI since many people don't know how affordable study abroad can actually be!"
UMD,3ch28z,SpicyTuna18,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:23:05 2015 UTC,"Also look at the Maryland-In programs if you're out of state since for those everyone pays a set program fee (some include housing, like Rome, but some don't like Barcelona and London). Same deal where financial aid and scholarships and all that apply here too. Just a hint that if you're in the business school the Global Initiatives Office offers scholarships to people who are going abroad for the first time, both short term and semester and literally everyone can get one that wants one."

We also had some free time here and there and activities we would normally do on our own planned as part of the trip (Bondi Beach and the Sydney Harbour Bridge climb, along with two breweries and a rum distillery, for example). Regardless of which program you choose you'll always have some free time to go see the area yourself and almost everyone goes out on free nights (Sydney nightlife is INSANE).  Edit: Just a tip that you should obtain some currency of the country you go to before you leave; the exchange rates are better than the booths at the airport. You can usually order it at your local bank and if they don't have it they'll have it shipped in no more than a few days at most, sometimes even next day)"

There were two projects in the class, each took about 2 hours to do. Look up her past exams on the Math Testbank. For us, there was a page of definition matching, a few pages of multiple choice, a page of spot the error in the code, and a page of interpreting SAS output.  As far as prepping ahead of time, be comfortable with the parametric methods that are taught in STAT401 (t-tests, confidence intervals, ANOVA, OLS). Also, look into the book titled ""The Little SAS Book"". It is much better than the one used in the course, and will help get you familiar with SAS syntax (P.S it's quirky af).  A ton of people ended up skipping the course about half way through the semester, as she posts all of her powerpoint slides online. She did, however, do extra credit for students who did show up to class about 3 times last semester. Hope this helps!  Also, you'll take a lot more from the course if you practice the methods taught on real data sets!

She has been using the same slides for a while, you can just download them and not bother with class where she will just read them.   HW's and Projects take little to no effort and if you've taken STAT400 or 410 you probably won't be learning much new stuff. Exams are just regurgitation, memorize terms and spit them back out.   Honestly I was really disappointed with it because it barely teaches you SAS. I would not tell anyone I know how to use SAS after this course and I was able to easily get a good grade"

Just keep your options open.

UMD,3cdrme,NickelobUltra,3,Tue Jul 7 04:25:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's worth a shot.  The work at Hopkins and the side job will definitely boost your application.  Your first two years aren't exactly a huge concern for colleges, they know that not everyone has a fantastic time going into high school.  They are more inclined to look at the change between freshman/sophomore years versus junior/senior years, actually.  I had a semi-mediocre freshman year and an average sophomore year, but my junior year was also honor roll both semesters and a 90 average, and senior year finished off just a little under junior year.  Doing a quick glance of most college app sites about average ACT scores for UMD applicants, it's like in the mid to upper 20s so go for taking it again unless you really don't want to (I believe UMD superscores), and even so a 25 isn't bad at all for applying to UMD.

The workload is kinda heavy, but it depends mostly on A. your attention span and B. your interest level. Grades are entirely based on essays (when I took it there were 4 throughout the semester) and participation. Killed all the essays but finished with a B+ because I didn't really participate. I'm assuming now that it's an I series though maybe participation won't be as heavy? Idk. But there's readings assigned every class. If you're good at reading historical documents and they interest you, you'll be fine. If not, it at least gets easier as the class progresses because the texts eventually become readable"

As mentioned above, my class had 4 essays (the last one being the final), and 30% of the grade based on participation in the discussion-dominant class. Bell didn't even lecture during the class period, instead he posts 25+ minutes lecture videos on YouTube for you to watch coupled with 40+ pages of history text. There are also extra credit events you can attend for his class.  The fact of the matter is, this class has alot of coursework, and enough reaching to really annoy me as an engineering major.

UMD,3ca9jy,iliketertles00,3,Mon Jul 6 09:25:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a current COMM Major on the Social Influence track. To be honest, I'm only keeping my COMM major because it sounds good and I'm too far into to quit. I think if you aren't going to do PR, then COMM as a major is, as you said, pretty vague. And PR is a lot more focused and that's why the COMM advisers will tell you that it's easier to switch out of PR than to switch into it. So I think if you are going to choose a track that is not PR, I think you've got a good idea to double major (I'm doing a double major with CCJS).   I can only speak for the majority of classes required for SI, but the classes are not difficult. There are a lot of papers and group projects. I think I've had a group project and group papers (which are the worst) in every COMM class I've taken (except COMM250).  And as wookachuk said, the track you choose isn't going to be the only thing you can do. Also you might want to double check the doubling in Graphic Design because I'm pretty sure my friend who is in COMM Studies just got into a Graphic Design program (not sure if it's just an elective kind of thing or if she actually is a double major with it)."

To be honest, I have trouble explaining it to people who want to know what I do so I just say it has to do with persuasion. And in a way it does have to do with persuasion, it's just very theory based. So like you learn about different communication styles, their components, and how they are used. And so there will be lots of powerpoints where you have to memorize those terms and theories. For me, this is really easy so I can get an easy A, but for others they can't stand it.   A popular class is COMM382 which is ""Essentials of Intercultural Communication"" and I took that with Deepa. Most of what we did was learn and understand how different cultures may communicate. So we had tests on those different terms and styles, but we also had group projects/papers focused on a certain country."

UMD,3ca9jy,wookachuk,2,Mon Jul 6 21:33:44 2015 UTC,"2013 Graduate in Comm Studies here.  Public Relations is a tougher track than you think that's what I originally was shooting for. I ended doing comm studies because the work load in the 200 level weed out class with prof. (Toth? something like that) was crazy. Also I'm not big into grammar and they treat the AP stylebook as a sort of Bible. (PR is somewhat journalism related as you need to write press releases etc.) Though if you don't mind a heavy workload I'm sure it is very rewarding as they push you towards a lot of groups that promote PR and can connect you with alummi and firms.  Comm studies seem to me to have more research classes and papers. I personally enjoyed the electives Negotiation and Conflict Management, speechwriting, etc. Although I originally wanted to do business.   I don't much about social influence.  But in the end the track you're in isn't the end of the world. I don't believe they put it on the diploma. And I've found the connections and experiences are more important than the classes. If you are interested in sustainability/the environment look into organizations or maybe a minor in Sustainability Studies or Environmental Economics and Policy. Get internships in an enviromentally related area like consulting or with the government. Those experiences can open a lot of doors. My girlfriend did sustainability and an internship related to wind energy for the government and really enjoyed it. Now she works for a consulting firm. I ended up in sales and now I.T. Go figure."
UMD,3ca9jy,jahajaha,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:06:46 2015 UTC,Wow you ended up in IT? Haha well at least you're somewhere lol. But in PR does a lot of work mean a lot of writing? Or just like a lot of assignments?
UMD,3ca9jy,shadyboy125,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:03:52 2015 UTC,"Well yes it's a lot of writing. PR in general is about effectively communicating with an audience. Whether that be through press releases, social media, emails, articles in a trade publication, speeches, whatever. And they are very picky about grammar and things like that. The AP style book is essentially rules governing on how newspaper people can write but apparently it's used in PR as well.   Not to say that PR is all writing it's also about reacting to situations and coming up with action plans, developing strategies, etc which is the interesting part.  Now my experiences are about 3 years old so they might not be hundred percent relevant. And this is just my personal opinion. I would suggest finding someone currently in public relations to talk to.  The 200 level classes were three days a week with an assignment every class plus a weekly assignment. He had high expectations and hate slackers. At least that's how it was when I took it. If I recall correctly there were two 200 level classes both with toth. Anyone who's took his class can tell you it's not easy. Of course I felt like his classes were to weed out people.  Of course if he's not there anymore they might not be so bad. When I was there he was the only one teaching the lower-level PR classes. I actually took one of the upper level pr classes just because and it had a pretty high workload and was a tough class but it was manageable. And they weren't quite so strict on things."

It helped me narrow down my list to only things I'd be interested in as a career vs  classes/subjects that I found interesting.

UMD,3c7o3t,libertyski12,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"I think if you have the mount you could do two monitors but you may need to do something a little funny regarding furniture arrangement. Using the regular stands with the monitors would be a bit more tricky  but both ways depends on how big your monitors are mainly. I'm not sure if I could have done it without having a really sharp angle between my two screens. As for if that mount is even usable on the desks that style won't do unless the clamps open really really far. Like probably more than five inches. Check out here to get some more ideas of what the furniture is like.  As others have said the shelf deal(I think it's called a hutch) isn't even attached to the desk. If your dressers are next to each other you can put it on top of them and it becomes fairly useful as a shelf.   I don't know about using the desk to support a loft bed. I've only seen the two long legs plus whatever other supports they have (and of course, a regular bunk bed). Be aware that a lofted bed is actually pretty high and can be tricky to get into depending on your layout and whether or not you use the guardrail on your bed."

I had a friend however who at one point had 3 21 inch monitors on his desk at the same time in either portrait or landscape, where some of the side monitors but not the stands hung off in landscape. If you have anything bigger than 21 inch monitors, I would suggest to just stick with two, but if you take the shelf off they should fit fine."

You won't be able to withdraw from an ATM with Ally savings but you can transfer your funds to the CapitalOne checking and withdraw freely from the ATM machine at Stamp. It does take a couple days to get a transfer done so if you want a fluid account while making some interest consider having an Ally Money Market Account.

It's got some theory, but not as much as other 400 level math courses, so it's still got plenty of the lower-level 'practical' (i.e. non-proof based) content from the 200 level courses that you might be used to.

For example, my prof. started the course with a lecture on sigma algebras, which you wouldn't see in 400 (and don't really need to understand the material).  As long as you read the text independently and do each example line by line, you should be fine though."

I worked in the performing arts library, but I was still under the general library department and I got to know a lot of the people that worked at McKeldin so I have an OK idea of what it's like.  It's fine, for a student job. You probably won't get many hours because a ton of students work for the library system, so plan on 10-15 hours, 20 if you're very lucky, per week. Pay will likely be $9-$10 an hour, I was paid $8.50 an hour but minimum wage has raised a bit since then.  Generally very laid back. I spent many hours in grad school shelving books upstairs alone with my earbuds in, enjoying the solitude and listening to music while I got paid to thumb through library stacks.  It's definitely way better than something like food services, but nowhere near as cozy as a full assistantship or something similar.

Simultaneously, a rotation of the classes are available in-person however this used to be Hinman-only.    A lot of it is reading followed by writing assignments related to startups.    ENES460 was the most influential class I took on learning the fundamentals of entrepreneurship theory.

There's a possiblity that I could do better next semester IF I get DSS accomodations for my mental health problems but what if that doesn't work out either?   this sounds like it could be a big problem. living with mental health problems is hard enough and dealing with them simultaneously with college and leaving home is really hard. you have my sympathy.   my sympathy can't be redeemed for food or currency though, so, what next? it sounds like you need to get a handle on managing yourself and succeeding at school. this sounds like an occasion to talk to some kind of mental health professional that is familiar with the problems you have, and to develop some kind of management plan. they can help you work through your bad head space issues in a way that the shitheads on the UMD subreddit can't.   so let's also just discard 2-4 because there's nothing you can do about it now.   you have to solve why you are failing everything. it's not worthwhile to keep failing everything. if you need to take a semester off to do that, that would be better. if you need to drop out of college for a year to work at Target stocking shelves to get some perspective that a college degree would be helpful, then do that (it really works)"
UMD,3bvrqp,whineless,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"Gonna leap onto this since this is really really good. Another thing to keep in mind is that you just finished your freshman year, which means a number of things. First, if you do drop out you didn't waste a ton of time in school on credits you didn't end up using, so it's not a huge loss. Obviously it'll suck but it's not the end of the world. Secondly, if you decide to stay you'll find that it gets better for a lot of people after their freshman year. I have a friend who says that school is just another skill, and that opened my eyes a lot as someone who has huge troubles focusing and didn't do well freshman year. It takes time to figure out methods that work best for you and eventually you'll get better at it.   What you have to realize is that none of this is the end of the world. Trust me, I know how stressful it can get with things piling on but you just have to take a step back and take your time. Solve one problem at a time and you'll be happier for it. If you need to take time off of school to figure your life out, who cares? The only thing that matters is your own health and happiness. If you want to come back to UMD or another school a little later, great! You won't regret getting a degree. That being said, it's also possible to have a fulfilling life without one.

At best it'll suck. A lot. At worst you'll exacerbate the issue.  I don't know what exactly you're dealing with. For me it was depression. Hit me hard the first semester of senior year (this past fall). Ended up completely withdrawing from the semester to focus on therapy and getting back on my feet. I was able to ease myself back into school with a lighter semester in the spring.  Some things to consider:  Have you talked to the financial aid office about potentially keeping your aid as your performance is a result of medical issues?  Have you seen a professional regarding your mental health?  Would taking a break from school make you happier? Healthier? Do you know what you would do during that time?

However, I've had anxiety/depression since puberty and I think I'm going to be struggling with it for the rest of my life. It never affected my learning too much until I got to college. The question for me is not whether to take care of myself (because I am!) but where to go from here.    Would taking a break from school make you happier? Healthier? Do you know what you would do during that time?    Yes, maybe, and...no. That's why I'm reluctant to take time off, because I want to have a solid plan/activity/job lined up so that I don't sink into a downward spiral with all that free time.

If you really feel this way and are questioning whether or not you should drop out, you probably should. Contact one of the offices and tell them you'd like to take a year off and then they will probably offer you the chance to come back in a year if they decide that you are for real and not just faking shit etc. I'm 90% sure this is a policy, but you'd have to do some research and call to find out.

Luckily for you, I just happened to pick HIST135 as one of my I-series courses(simply because almost no others were the least bit interesting to me). I can offer some insight on that history course. Here goes:  Cooperman is good at attempting to make things funny and interesting. However, he isn't afraid to make a couple of humorously snide comments which might make people drop the course if it's stuffed full. You get participation points if you enter the class with a brief presentation(completely oral is fine) of a recent riot in the news. Be prepared to be questioned by the TA. The other way to get them is to answer questions in class, and you WILL get called on, even if you don't raise your hand. Cooperman doesn't give you enough time to think so be on your toes. If you're slow to respond intelligently, like me, presenting riots is the only way to get those points. Workload is completely manageable. Exams are pretty easy. Participate as much as you can in lecture and discussion. I SUCK at history and had no business taking that class other than for requirements, but still made a pretty good grade. Assuming you're more interested in history than I am, give it a shot. It's about riots! Riots can't be that boring. It's your first year, you'll never know if you discover a new passion.   And a quick note on course numbers: Don't read too deep into them unless it's a subject that builds and relies heavily on prior knowledge, like math. My other I-series course, EDSP289I, was WAY easier than HIST135(though a small part of it has to do with my interest in the former subject and sucking at the latter subject). The difficulty(but not the importance, I assure you) of my 400-level courses on education so far pale in comparison to the difficulty of 100-level mathematics courses, which are horribly taught and are a real bear here. It's just an approximation. Ask your advisor if you have questions about how hard courses truly are.  Good luck!"

There's a midterm and a final, though the bulk of the work for the latter is for a paper(~5 pages; the TA explicitly said he won't read past the 6th page at the end, so be wary of that); the ""exam"" that you take with the rest of the class is very easy.

We had roaches for 1-2 months, but haven't seen a single one for years now. Another friend of ours had a very similar experience.  I think management has pest control guys come to all units maybe once a year, but if you report roaches management will sign you up for more frequent visits. As far as I can tell they just put little dabs of poison in the kitchen.  Long story short: there are roaches, but it's been a non-issue for me because they seem easy to get rid of."
UMD,3bpomy,dezgot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing based on how long you've been staying there that you would recommend it? Any general comments to/for/against it?  I've lived at Campus Gardens for 2 years and can't really complain about anything major about my apartment (geographic area kinda sucks, parking situation is terrible) but they're upping rent again so I'm contemplating making a move if I can find something nicer. Seven Springs apartments are definitely a decent bit bigger than my current 1 BR."
UMD,3bpomy,dezgot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:48:57 2015 UTC,"SSV is reasonable if you can manage the rent and you need to be bus/bike/walking distance from campus. It's a decent option for a few more years if that describes you. Here are some ramblings:  The thing that sets SSV apart from places like Mazza Grandmarc and Enclave is that SSV wasn't originally built just to make a quick buck off students living there temporarily. Mazza is catastrophically cheaply built. I could hear everything in the apartment above me: cell phones vibrating, TV, conversations, and footsteps. It's really old and run down, but SSV seems to have more reasonable construction and isolation is much better. This is kind of the main motif of SSV for me: it's definitely older/cheaper student housing, but you can often tell that it used to be nicer.  They used to have permits and fancy gates, but now parking here is a free for all. It's always easy to find a spot.  It's a short drive, but traffic on route 1 really sucks during peak hours. The lights/traffic on Cherry Hill going to route 1 also particularly suck. Biking down the trail is a nice alternative.  There is secretly a surprisingly good restaurant in the basement of 9348. The tennis courts are recently refinished and have lights for night play."

You can usually count on there being additional openings if it's the sort of course tons of students enroll in and need to have in order to graduate at a reasonable pace. You should be able to find a spot in ENGL 101, any common lower level MATH(think 1xx or 2xx), or your basic CMSC(compsci) class. I dunno much about your chances at a less common class. What class is it?"
UMD,3bk2mo,MelloMathTeacher,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:36:35 2015 UTC,Math 241.  I was looking to get a class with Margetis bc I heard he was a good teacher
UMD,3bk2mo,MelloMathTeacher,2,Mon Jun 29 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"MATH241 shouldn't be a problem. They should open up more sections for you freshmen over the course of orientation. Getting a specific instructor may be a bit trickier. Freshmen don't have as much flexibility. As a personal recommendation, try to get Justin Wyss Gallifent. I've never had Margetis, but I know for a fact that Justin is the best math professor(in fact, best teacher period) I've ever encountered here at UMD. As an aspiring math teacher myself, take my word for it. He's challenging, yet goes out of his way to clarify everything, is very fair, and pretty funny, too. Trust me. No other math professor I've had comes close. If you can't get him, then try for Margetis. At least you've got two good ones to shoot for; that's better than what you are usually offered in math here."
UMD,3bk2mo,_zhang,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"Well thanks a ton for that in-depth reply, currently the only available ones are Ebrahimian and Rosca, but I'll keep an eye out for Gallifent.

Rosca sucks, don't get stuck with her.  I've had both Ebrahimian and Wyss-Gallifent, and I personally liked Ebrahimian better (but Justin was definitely very good too). Basically, I'm trying to tell you to register for Ebrahim. Just do it. Do it! Just register for anyone but Rosca! Don't waitlist for Margetis, not get in, and then get stuck with Rosca!"

UMD,3bk2mo,dontocsata,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, you will get used to Testudo's business hours before long.  Your waitlists will show up on your student schedule page and on the waitlist check-in page.  To waitlist for a course, go to drop/add and type in the course and the number of a section that's full (eg 0211 for math241). Then it will let you check up to 6 sections to waitlist for.  You must check in every day of classes during the drop/add period or they drop you from the waitlist."

UMD,3be64q,cherboi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think we knew we would do well in non-revs, it was more a concern about long term success in what is perceived as a lesser conference for basketball, lax, soccer, baseball, etc. we did real well in all these sports so I think everyone was more accepting of us. Compare that to Rutgers who still gets shit from everyone cause they suck at every sport.  The biggest question for fans of Maryland and other B1G schools was our success in football and to a slightly lesser extent men's hoops. We kinda fell into a perfect storm with down years for Michigan and Penn State so I think that really helped our cause to come out of those road games with wins. And then basketball just took it to a whole new level and things started off real nice with Indiana, Michigan St, and Wisco.  Long story short, a year later I'm pretty damn happy we got out of the ACC / new Big East. I was concerned at first when they announced, but the fans are way better here and there's way more depth in almost every sport. I think from our fans perspective, there's just way more excitement about the future. And money."
UMD,3bg0pd,Butterfingerpizza,5,Sun Jun 28 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"Medical school is the plan that you should follow if you want to be a practicing dermatologist. However, most dermatologists have physician assistants (PAs) that handle many of the patients they see. Although they get paid less, physician assistants go through a different education process which can be finished in just 2-3 years after undergraduate. See this page for more information. As far as undergraduate at UMD is concerned, any major which filters into medical school should be fine for a physician assisant program (biology, microbiology, immunology, etc.)."

UMD,3b82fq,flyingturtle29,2,Fri Jun 26 18:48:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, a little late to the party here, but I did FC last year. I took Chem135, Math140, Engl101, Phil140, and Univ100. It was a very manageable schedule. As for pros and cons  Pros: You aren't going to community college your first semester, it's very easy to meet people since the classes are generally smaller, and, if you like to sleep in, you have late classes.   Cons: FC students register later than everyone else for spring classes, you have to take UNIV100 (biggest bullshit class of all time), and because classes are late in the day, it's very hard to participate in the clubs and activities that your non-FC friends do.  Finally, one thing I noticed in freshman connection was that a lot of the kids were the smart slacker type. A.k.a, kids that didn't really try in high school but were naturally bright enough to just barely get into Maryland. If that applies to you, do not think for a second that you can do the same shit you did in high school. UMD is more work intensive than high school was by a long shot. I made the mistake of thinking I could still just coast through and rely on my natural skill set and that landed me a 2.7 GPA my first semester. If that doesn't apply to you and you were a hard worker in high school, good, keep it up. You're gonna have to work hard to do well at UMD. College is a lot of fun, but it is very easy to get distracted from you school work. Just remember to try to keep a healthy balance. Good luck and have fun this fall!"

I found it pretty easy, probably because I didn't take a math or science first semester. If your classes end up being easy, still work hard, but smart. FC honestly sucked ass for me. If it's the same for you, don't be afraid to talk to someone in the counseling center if you start feeling really down.  What you said about FC students was interesting. Not trying to sound arrogant or anything, but I know I'm bright, and I did well on my SAT's. It was my GPA that got me into FC, I'm sure."

Why go there when there are so many other places around it that sells the same stuff but even better.  The Mexican/chipotle style burrito place was garbage. It was awful. The only time people went there was for the one dollar taco special. Then that place got replaced under same ownership for a BBQ place that was very below average. Overpriced for shitty half ass BBQ.   Is the eyewear repair store still open? That place is a joke. 15 dollars for unlimited eye repair that you would probably only go once.

There were no full-blown math courses to my recollection, however, and certainly not any of the calculus courses such as 141. I have a hard time thinking one can digest such a difficult course in only three weeks, but that's just me. Some geniuses on this subreddit may tell you otherwise.  No physics courses showed up either. I wouldn't count on either of them being offered next winter. 141 and other lower-level math will certainly show up in the summer, however, and physics courses probably will as well.   I did, however, find ENES 102 and ENES 220 on the winter 2015 Schedule of Classes. I'm not an engineer, so I don't know how rigorous those classes are(though from what I've heard engineers have it tough from a courseload and rigor standpoint), but even just one these classes is three hours a day, five days a week, and that's not counting the studying and homework you're almost certainly going to need to do.

UMD,3ax1pl,UMDorPSU,8,Wed Jun 24 04:46:23 2015 UTC,Getting in-state tuition is very difficult if you or your legal guardians do not have a documented history of living in this state and paying taxes.
UMD,3ax1pl,worldchrisis,2,Wed Jun 24 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"Well shit... Thanks anyway! It looks like you were a CS grad from Maryland. What's the CS program like there? I really don't want a basic IT job out of college, and I'd rather do something more exciting. Does Maryland offer programs where you can apply your CS knowledge to other stuff such as robotics?"
UMD,3ax1pl,Vctoreh,2,Wed Jun 24 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"CS is amazing here. There're quite a few threads on the program in this sub, but the take-away should be that it's an amazing program that opens all doors and places grads in top tier jobs."
UMD,3ax1pl,worldchrisis,2,Wed Jun 24 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"A CS degree is what you make of it once you get into the real world. I know CS grads who work for Amazon and Google, CS grads who work for government contractors, CS grads who work for startups, and CS grads doing PHD research in robotics and machine learning.  There are courses at UMD that deal with things like machine learning, mobile app development, game development, etc. But if you want to get into a field like that, it's more on you to get experience in that field through extracurricular research, internships, and independent skill development."
UMD,3ax1pl,whenuseeit,4,Wed Jun 24 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"Theoretically you could list your cousins' address on your application, but I'm not sure if they technically need to be your legal guardians or not so if you get caught somehow you may get in trouble. Once you get here they make you jump through hoops of fire to reclassify yourself. I went through the process after I started grad school, which made it a little bit easier because I wasn't living in campus housing anymore and I was no longer my parents' dependent. Here's the website with the procedures:  http://www.registrar.umd.edu/Residency/resreclassprocedures.html"
UMD,3ax1pl,arghnoname,2,Wed Jun 24 06:28:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah they can be a bit thorny about it. When I did it, generally speaking you have to move to the state ahead of time, not be listed as a dependent on your parents (out of state) taxes, get in-state paperwork (driver's license, etc, should be in MD), and then wait a year. Things may have changed since or I may have been extra cautious then, but I doubt it is any easier."
UMD,3ax1pl,whenuseeit,2,Wed Jun 24 07:00:01 2015 UTC,"They still do the year thing. Also you need to provide proof that you did not move to Maryland for the sole purpose of education, and apparently evidence of you having a job for over a year and paying MD state taxes does not count for that. Two years later I'm still really fucking irritated about that."

UMD,3au7hf,kailman,4,Tue Jun 23 15:25:47 2015 UTC,Not really all that hard.  I did it and I'm a doof.  The best thing you are doing is deciding early on you want to do it.  Makes it much easier.   Make sure to get advising EVERY time you make your schedule.  Go to the peer advising place in the mitchel building I think?  They employ wizards. Want to make sure your schedule is efficient. You will probably take an extra class or two every year given the overlap between math and comp sci. Do it because the more time you have the more time you waste.  Don't give me the whole 'ill be missing out on the college experience of hanging out with my friends and talking about philosophy' bullshit.  Odds are you are going to turn netflix time into another degree Do it because 2 for the price of one Do it because you will dual wield on graduation Do it because you are motherfucking kailman and you will be damned if you put up with this mono-degree bullshit   Edit-  Oh and about the whole credit cap thing in comp sci.  Go to your adviser and say 'ayyy let me sign up for more credits homes' and they will give you permission. Edit 2 - I didn't take any summer classes.  The course load was fine though.  You are young.  Get in to the habit of treating school like work.  Be on the clock from 9-5 every day.  You will have to change it up when you have exam heavy weeks and all. By working consistently every day you will surprise yourself with what loads you can carry.
UMD,3au7hf,NOT_THE_DROIDS_,3,Tue Jun 23 22:53:27 2015 UTC,"As a freshman, you'll have to take the requisite math classes for CS anyway, so this is a decision you can delay. If you're finding yourself struggling while taking CMSC131(the easiest CS class you'll take here), and you're also struggling in math then it's going to be rough. I won't discourage you from it, but I think it will highly depend on your impression of your first year. If you make a sample 4 year plan of all your classes you can see how much you can expect in each semester. You'd definitely need better than average time management."

UMD,3au7hf,CannedBeef,3,Tue Jun 23 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"I'm doubling in math and computer science as well. It really depends on how many credits you're coming in with and what math/cmsc you're starting with. Are you starting with cmsc 131? What math class are you starting with?  A double major is very doable and probably a good idea. A double degree with both degrees being sciences doesn't really have a point, but if you have the credits might as well. Start off by taking a few hard math classes with your cmsc courses to see if you can handle it before committing a second major."
UMD,3au7hf,CannedBeef,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"I'm entering with a whopping 0 credits and have to complete a pre-calculus course before I can begin cmsc 131. I'm studying now to retake the placement test, so, hopefully, I won't be in this situation.  I was considering a double degree in CS and math because I thought it would be a relatively simple double degree regimen since there is a lot of overlap, but if it doesn't really have a point, what would be one that would make sense? I'm just curious about the possibilities."
UMD,3au7hf,worldchrisis,2,Tue Jun 23 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"As a double major it makes a lot of sense, but from what I hear a double degree is only worth getting if one is science and one is arts. I'm not saying a double degree is pointless, just that it doesn't seem to have any advantages over a double major. A double degree seems to be mainly for if you get one degree in sciences and one in arts, so like a degree in computer science and a degree in English. And I think UMD only offers math as a bachelor of science. Again I'm not entirely sure how it works.  There is a lot of overlap, so a double major is very convenient - especially if you make cmsc your ""supporting sequence"" for the math major. Just make sure to look at the requirements for both and make a 4 year plan in advance with some wiggle room just in case."
UMD,3au7hf,CannedBeef,3,Tue Jun 23 17:05:34 2015 UTC,You can double degree and get 2 BS's or 2 BA's.   The main difference is if you double degree you actually get 2 separate pieces of paper. If you get a double major you get 1 degree with 2 subjects on it.
UMD,3au7hf,worldchrisis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:57:23 2015 UTC,"Right, sorry if I was unclear. I'm just unsure of whether or not there are any actual benefits to having 2 seperate pieces of paper, as opposed to one saying you double majored. Would you happen to know?"
UMD,3au7hf,worldchrisis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:18:08 2015 UTC,"I got a double degree.   The conversation typically goes ""I have degrees in CS and History"", ""Oh so you double majored?"", ""No I have two separate bachelor's degrees"", ""Oh wow.""  I have no idea if it makes a meaningful difference, people seem to be impressed. I would imagine having a second degree in something versus having it as your secondary major is a plus if you want to do something in that field, but I haven't tried to do anything with my History degree so I don't really know."
UMD,3au7hf,hphong591992,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:28:06 2015 UTC,"If you have 0 credits to start, a double degree in 4 years probably isn't feasible. It would likely take you 5 years unless you are taking Summer and Winter courses every year.   The only real difference is you would have a degree in CS and a degree in Math, whereas if you got a double major you would have one degree in both.   Why specifically do you want a double degree vs a double major?"
UMD,3au7hf,hphong591992,2,Tue Jun 23 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"i thought that earning a double degree held more weight than a double major, but this thread has helped me see the light. i will not go for a double degree, but i will work towards a double major."
UMD,3au7hf,worldchrisis,2,Tue Jun 23 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's up to you. Calculate how many credits you will need for double major. I believe for CS & Math to have double degree, you need 150 credits, so think about it. I think you can request double degree in the middle of the progress.  But it's a far story, let see how your first year goes, and then you decide later. But you need to take a lot of classes for that. If you don't think math major / degree works, still can earn a minor although it seems useless."

UMD,3au7hf,thirstyturtlelives,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't even where you start and finishing the course requirements, it's just how many credits you have to take. 15 credits is the average semester. To get to 150 you'd have to have 2 extra normal semesters, or take 18 credits per semester every semester and take 6 credits during some Summer and Winter sessions."
UMD,3au7hf,rcktkng,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:21:16 2015 UTC,"I started from CMSC-132, skipping CMSC-250. I did 2 semesters, each 20 credits, so I guess it's possible to do so without extra summer / winter. I saw a person took 21 credits, so I assume you can do this. Of course, I strongly discourage people taking over 18 credits. 18 credits is already a lot. I got 2 B+ and 4A, but I don't have social life.   Anyway, what I say is theoretically, it's possible."
UMD,3au7hf,worldchrisis,2,Wed Jun 24 05:51:50 2015 UTC,It probably depends on how many credits you already have going in. I did a double degree and only had to take a few summer and winter classes but I came in as a freshman with 25 credits. If you arent coming in with credits you would probably have to take summer and winter classes every semester.
UMD,3au7hf,Vctoreh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:39:45 2015 UTC,jeez... thanks for the info.
UMD,3au7hf,Vctoreh,2,Tue Jun 23 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"It entirely depends upon how well the two majors cross over with one another. The rule of thumb is for dual-majoring that it's ~30 extra credits (as you were told). But it could be less if some of the math classes you take for CS count towards the Math one. I'd check with both departments (and have copies of both sets of required courses, and maybe their descriptions) to be sure.  If you're serious about a dual major, it's good to start early. An extra 30 credits is basically another class each semester. And if you're going to be around during the summer then you can knock out at least an extra class there.  Also, how many credits does the nominal CS degree take? Some degrees require more classes than others. As an anecdotal story, as a sophomore I looked into a programming minor with my Aerospace major - to me the two seemed to make sense when paired together. When I talked to the folks in at the respective department (I forget which, but I met them somewhere in A.V. Williams) they told me the minor was 34 additional credits - on top of the 125-126 credits required for my major (with CORE classes, or whatever they might be called now). So there was no way that was going to happen.  TL;DR - If you can find someone who has done exactly what you're trying to do, that's the best option. Because it really depends on the exact circumstances of the two majors."
UMD,3au7hf,chweris,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I was considering those two for a double major since they both overlap a lot. I'll consult the mathematics department to get more info.  Also, a CS degree requires 120 credits, but I believe that they don't allow you to take the maximum of 18 credits per semester (I think the max is 17)."
UMD,3au7hf,jjhats,2,Tue Jun 23 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"Every degree requires 120 credits, there are a lot of elective or upper-level concentration slots in the CS 4 year plan though, so it's not hard and actually pretty common for CS majors to pick up a minor or a second major, since you have to take multiple upper level courses outside of CS anyway."
UMD,3avhld,Toasted_FlapJacks,3,Tue Jun 23 20:53:15 2015 UTC,This schedule is not bad at all! None of those classes are particularly demanding. You should be fine!

For ENES100 the professor doesn't matter that much, since a majority of the class is your hovercraft project. I'd probably take those 2, add ENGL101, and then 2 gen-eds to ease yourself into the college workload.

You may not be able to choose which professor you have anyway.  Not too familiar with the chem professors, but I would definitely look for advice from someone who knows before choosing.  I think that it would be a good idea to take a gen ed class or two too to cover some core credits at this point. Typically, your advisor will be really good about suggesting courses to take each semester. It might be worthwhile to email him to ask which additional engineering course you could take.  Good luck during your first semester! Don't let a harsh readjustment period from high school get you down.

Chem was my toughest subject but Koppel's class was apparently much worse. I'd probably suggest switching out your humanities for MATH241/6 (how far along are you in math?) if you think you can handle it. Calc 3 is way easier than 2 in my opinion. And if you got dif eq. out of the way during your first semester you'll be in really good shape. It'll be nice to take all stem classes now while they're relatively easy so you you can balance out upper level Civil classes with a humanities credit here or there.

You have to sign in for attendance at each class though. As far as workload there were like three fairly short homeworks plus one 10-15 page final paper (no exam).   Personally, it didn't help me decide what kind of engineering I wanted to pursue. Basically the Dean introduces a professor from a different department each week and then sits down the rest of the time. I thought I'd at least get to start a relationship with the Dean, which would obv be super valuable, but instead I heard some absolutely terrible lectures by really smart engineers who just have no idea how to make or give a presentation.  EDIT: Oh, and I'd still consider dropping the humanities and adding PHYS260. I should've taken it last semester but took easy gen-eds (INAG107...) instead.

If you still need to get into the school, I recommend taking a lighter course load in tandem with CHEM135 (if you're like me and the other civil students I know, chem is not our best subject) to balance your GPA just in case you end up with a C in chem. For chem professors I'd go with Stocker, I've heard she's not too difficult in comparison to the others you've listed.   As for ENES100, I took the course Fall 2014, which was the first semester they implemented the new Over-Sand Vehicle (OSV) project. It didn't go so well for our class so we all ended up with very lenient grading. Now it seems like they've refined how they go about the project, but it's a lot of work nonetheless.   If you're planning on taking CHEM and ENES in the same semester, your workload is going to be fairly significant so I wouldn't take any more heavy coursework classes. Good luck!"

Now they're doing a car capable of driving and digging through sand.   I don't know anything about Chem, sorry. I had an AP credit for it.   For gen eds, I'd say take Comm107 early on.

UMD,3aq5bh,midnight11,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:29:46 2015 UTC,Career wise is very broad. Define that further. Do you mean professional networking? Core CS skills? Programming skills they don't teach you in CS? What?
UMD,3aq5bh,midnight11,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:12:55 2015 UTC,Pretty much everything but since you gave me options I would say Professional Networking. What do you think?
UMD,3aq5bh,AjJajeBgosh,2,Mon Jun 22 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"Try to keep an eye out for career fairs, there's a handful of those throughout the year. When speakers are brought in, which they are fairly regularly, make an effort to talk to them after - get their card. Beef up your portfolio / resume with personal projects so you have something to talk about. There's always events and groups in DC to attend. If you really wanted to meet people and stand out, pull the student card and try to attend those.  Networking is really just talking with people. That's all it is."
UMD,3ao566,Vctoreh,3,Mon Jun 22 02:58:46 2015 UTC,"GERM204 is an intensive grammar class. I wouldn't necessarily say it's difficult, but I tend to be good at that kind of stuff (plus I was an engineering major, so my one German class per semester was always my ""easy"" class). If you feel confident you can learn the material from 103/203 over the summer, then I'd say go for it. Worst case scenario you take it for a week or so, realize you're in over your head, and switch classes. Plus IIRC a lot of German classes give you a placement exam of sorts on the first day of class. Nothing too bad, they just want to make sure you're not over-/underqualified for that class.  I took a European placement test for German as a second language classes during my semester abroad and placed into B1-2, after taking 103, 203, 204, and 301 at UMD. 103/203 miiiight get you to A2-1."

UMD,3ao566,tenac6,2,Mon Jun 22 04:28:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's one of those classes where you get what you put into. You can manage a good grade by just doing the minimum work, but if you really want to improve you need to do a lot of review outside of class. Like the guy below me, after 301 I was placed into B1, however I didn't really put a lot of effort into it outside of class."

UMD,3af0uy,fshad,2,Fri Jun 19 16:25:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, it counts. The only difference with freshman forgiveness is that the cumulative GPA will not include the lower grade (though it will still appear on the transcript). Depending on your major, my advice MAY be NOT to repeat it, because in certain tough majors you may need those repeats."
UMD,3af0uy,temporaltantrum,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:30:12 2015 UTC,Your best bet before repeating a class is to talk to your advisor to see what the best course of action is; they may say to either repeat that class or to save it for another class down the road that is more important and therefore more worthy of a retake. They will have the best answer
UMD,3af0uy,NHL_nutjob_19,2,Sat Jun 20 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Do people really rely on their advisors that much? Yes, their job is to advise, but I've found it's generally better to do the research yourself to make sure you make the right decision."
UMD,3af0uy,radecki,2,Sat Jun 20 00:31:25 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person to be honest. Me personally I do my own research but I go over everything with my advisor anyway. I also have a VERY GOOD advisor and therefore I like going to her because she knows what she's doing and what the requirements are, what classes I should take, and all that stuff. If you have a good advisor, it's so helpful"
UMD,3af0uy,NHL_nutjob_19,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think ""good"" advisors are less common, so it's always safe to make sure that you're doing the right think. With a good advisor, undergrad certainly becomes a bit easier to plan!"
UMD,3af0uy,radecki,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:25:57 2015 UTC,"It counts towards your repeat credits, it just doesn't count towards your overall GPA. From my experience, that is. Also, if you end up reaching the limit of repeatable credits any time during your college career, they'll try and tell you you've gone over when you really haven't. I was at 12 credits and was repeating a 4 credit course and the system refused to let me because it said it would go over 18 credits. I had to get my adviser to help me submit a policy exception to let me. Don't take anything they say for granted, talk to your adviser or whoever is in charge of the college about it, they'll usually help you."

UMD,3a8xk1,Telexon,9,Thu Jun 18 11:26:24 2015 UTC,Both days have important information so you should attend both days. Try calling again sometime and ask them to change you to commuter. That way you won't have a room key to worry about.
UMD,3a8xk1,TrueDoomsday,8,Thu Jun 18 13:08:53 2015 UTC,"Just go both days... I just went and it was really fun. The orientation advisers are the best part of the whole thing, all of them are hilarious"
UMD,3a8xk1,JohnSLS,6,Thu Jun 18 17:22:33 2015 UTC,You should attend both days. There isn't a set time for getting IDs and registering for classes as they break everyone up into groups and have to rotate groups through the various activities and info sessions.
UMD,3a8xk1,worldchrisis,5,Thu Jun 18 14:21:37 2015 UTC,Attend both days.  Why won't you be staying on campus?

UMD,3a7jd2,worldchrisis,2,Wed Jun 17 21:34:22 2015 UTC,"4 challenging courses is a lot. Especially your first semester when you haven't acclimated to college yet. It's doable but you'll really have to stay on top of your workload, start projects early, not take nights off, etc.  Everyone's freshman schedule looks horrifying, because intro classes all meet 3-5 times a week, whereas higher level courses usually only meet 1-3 times a week."
UMD,3a7jd2,uberbob79,2,Wed Jun 17 21:36:35 2015 UTC,Should I drop a course to free up my schedule?

UMD,39ytsu,claytonblythe,8,Mon Jun 15 22:08:44 2015 UTC,A lot of people like to ride on the Paintbranch trail. It starts near shoppers and goes past the golf course and runs next to campus and ends up at Lake Artemesia. It's definitely one of the more scenic places you'll find in CP.
UMD,39ytsu,bluemo0n,4,Mon Jun 15 22:34:39 2015 UTC,It actually goes on further through Riverdale and into Bladensburg and then you can loop back through Adelphi. Check out the Anacostia Tributary Trails system.

UMD,39ytsu,bluemo0n,7,Tue Jun 16 03:29:47 2015 UTC,Lake Artemesia is good and from there you can go south along the Anacostia which is a pretty nice ride.
UMD,39ytsu,TrueDoomsday,5,Tue Jun 16 00:15:08 2015 UTC,Head out to Lake Artemesia and take the trail that extends off from the southeast corner. You can stay straight on that for a long while and it runs along the Anacostia for a few miles.
UMD,39ytsu,Misunderstud,4,Tue Jun 16 00:37:15 2015 UTC,"The Paintbranch trail is actually part of a bigger trail system called Anacostia Tributary Trail system (look it up on Google maps). I think I've biked the entire thing (at least to the point where the trail ends and you have to get back on a road) and it's not too bad (<15 miles). If you want a better trail, try the C & O canal in DC. It takes you up to Great Falls, Virginia. Check out this website. Unfortunately, you have to transport your bike on metro to initially get there but it's not so bad for a weekend trip."

UMD,39yacs,thedman9052,2,Mon Jun 15 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"If you want to take a scuba class, you're probably better off doing it somewhere else. Same certification, much less money. The KNES class is two credits, which is over $1000 (for in-state...for out-of-state it's over $2700). I took an open water certification class this spring at the National Diving Center in DC, and the entire thing was $450. That's class time, pool time, and certification dives/fees. The only thing that wasn't included was personal gear (mask/fins/snorkel), which isn't super expensive. Hell, I could take another class there to get my advanced open water certification and I still would have spent less money than if I had done the OW class at UMD."
UMD,39yacs,whenuseeit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:50:14 2015 UTC,I guess this is what I should have expected. I was hoping there would be some kind of community education class setup that just used UMD facilities.

UMD,39rzof,sbl03,3,Sun Jun 14 05:10:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome. They told me wired it was limited to 10Mb/s down, so all of this is really nice to hear. Definitely not dreading hooking up to the dorm network now. Thanks for the info."
UMD,39rzof,asljkdfhg,2,Sun Jun 14 05:28:23 2015 UTC,100Mbps is 12.5MB/s... So you sort of are limited to 10ish... Though that's still decently fast.
UMD,39rzof,Drayeth,2,Sun Jun 14 13:39:29 2015 UTC,my speeds with wired connection was usually 3.5MB/s. it's actually pretty damn fast

For illegal content, it depends on specific situation:  You might just have your account disabled and be asked to remove content at the very least.  If you have any more questions let me know.  As for the VPN question, there should be no problems, we avoid doing any filtering on student connections unless we have to."

UMD,39qaly,Umdterp_29,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:35:45 2015 UTC,"Those General Ed category courses ARE your electives. You can certainly take additional courses that don't fulfill your major requirements nor the General Ed requirements, but they won't count towards your degree, unless it's just because they help add up to the requisite number of total credits."
UMD,39qaly,temporaltantrum,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:00:24 2015 UTC,Depending on your program there are electives that you can take to fulfill gen-ed requirements and pure electives where you can take anything you want just for the sake of taking it (at least in my plan there's a certain number of credits that have to be like pure elective non-gen ed classes)
UMD,39qaly,NHL_nutjob_19,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:42:41 2015 UTC,"When you fill up the GenEd and Major Requirements at the minimum, you will most likely end up with less than 120 credits (one of the requirement for graduation). Electives basically fills up any holes in your schedules."
UMD,39qaly,khui88,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:52:13 2015 UTC,Thank you! This cleared things up nicely. :D So I assume my second question means that course counts as only 3 credits?
UMD,39qaly,khui88,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:09:37 2015 UTC,"It will still count as 3 credits (or 4 as you said in the question?). A class can still count towards multiple requirements for your GenEd or Major, but the credits for that particular class can only be counted once."

However the last two parts can be pretty difficult depending on your grasp of calculus.  I would recommend, for the most part, studying up on pre-calc (definitely) and calc.  To put it into perspective, when I took the placement last summer, despite the fact that I passed well enough to get MATH140, the last two parts were nothing to laugh at then."

UMD,39nqg8,JohnSLS,0,Sat Jun 13 17:28:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh, idk then. Those scores are above average I think so you should do just fine. You dont want to be taking a math class you cant handle.  For me, I want to skip as many maths as I can because I'm great at it, but I want to take all the entry level english's, history's, chem's because I am not so strong there"
UMD,39nqg8,MilesHighClub_,0,Sat Jun 13 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"If you have to study for it that's not a good sign. It's fairly basic. You can use a calculator. There's a crazy amount of time. And if all else fails you have wolfram alpha. The absolute best case scenario is you get put into calc 1. Sounds like you need to retake it anyway so I'm guessing that's what you want. Unless you want to go back to precalc, but I've heard at umd precalc is a bitch. I mean all math classes are here really though"

UMD,39m3ia,potus01,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:35:58 2015 UTC,Would it be better just to retake 131 and get the A since it's the basis for CS 132?

But if you're already confident in your skills, you will never have the motivation to actually do anything in that class. I came in with no CS knowledge and still was bored the whole class. If you can skip taking a class and free yourself up for some random, abstract class, take the opportunity. That's what college is about."

I see a lot of people come in who think they're some hotshot because they know html and then have a lot of trouble in 132. Plus, not all local high schools teach the same CS content so you're better off starting your first semester easy and then ramping up later once you figure out how much you can handle."
UMD,39m3ia,TheIllogical,5,Tue Jun 16 06:48:47 2015 UTC,Do NOT take lipsman for 246. He has to be the worst one. I had him and have to retake it this summer. Try to take Justin. He's great all around.
