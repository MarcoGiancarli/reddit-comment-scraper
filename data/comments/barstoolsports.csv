There is nothing about ""targeting"" Barstool in this post, that is not how exploits of this sort work. The problem is public and obvious. An attacker is simply looking for any of this kind of login they can find, and Barstool qualifies. Similarly with DB vulnerabilities, it's very simple to crawl and look at Wordpress sites and try to break in. Nobody is sitting in a dark room eating pizza picking out Barstool to attack. Attackers look for the lowest hanging fruit, and you qualify.  And if you don't think this kind of shit ruins people's lives, you can read this.

This is a SERIOUS problem, and it's astounding that no one seems to understand why.   Exactly, it's the same sign in. Commenters sign in and have commenter access, bloggers sign in and have WP dash access."
barstoolsports,3e5c6v,devthrowaway4,3,Wed Jul 22 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"Okay, OP. First off, good on you for taking the time to write this, but I can dispel a lot of incorrect assumptions and statements that you make regarding the security of the site.   The site uses Auth0 as the login provider. This means a few things, firstly being that authentication is done via digitally signed JWTs that are sent/received via SSL XHR to Auth0 servers. Secondly, all communications done with Auth0 are hashed using bcrypt by default, making sniffing of the traffic meaningless. Should Barstoolsports.com/login ideally be SSL secured? Of course. But does it greatly affect the security of the current implementation? No. Though the page you are on is not SSL signed, you are not actually communicating between Barstool servers and your machine at that point in the login process. All data is routed (via SSL POST requests) to Auth0 who then redirects back to Barstool with the correctly signed JWT once authentication is complete. At no time is unencrypted data being sent to Barstool. Check for yourself if you don't believe me. Also see here: https://auth0.com/security Passwords are stored in the Wordpress local DB. This means that they are both hashed and salted. I could give you that DB in plaintext and there would be shit all you could do with it.   It seems like you are a smart dude, using the right words, but some of your claims just make no sense. ""One way hash"" is implied -- all hash functions are inherently one-way and implicitly limit the ability to reverse them. A ""two-way hash"" is an oxymoron and equates to only an encoding.  You also make the wholly inaccurate statement that hackers can ""install toolkits"" that will sniff traffic between a user and Barstool, thus making them susceptible to attack. This again, is wrong. Network sniffing (barring sniffing done at a global network level, i.e. NSA) can only be done locally. This implies that either your computer is infected with some software such that a man-in-the-middle attack is possible, or that your router is DNS poisoned, etc.  This is not some sweeping problem that would affect every user even if it affected some. But, as I addressed earlier, this isn't a concern regardless because of the way the data is handled/sent to the Auth0 provisioning servers.  Appreciate the hustle, but you are wrong about this specific concern to Barstool security."
barstoolsports,3e5c6v,devthrowaway4,0,Wed Jul 22 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"I am not incorrect.  That is an incomplete understanding of Auth0 attack vectors. Serving the login page not over SSL makes it trivial to compromise, and I (and I would say the entire security community) would wholly disagree with you. Read here if you don't believe me:   Here’s an often held conversation between concerned website user and site owner:  User: “Hey mate, your website isn’t using SSL when I enter my password, what gives?!”  Owner: “Ah, but it posts to HTTPS so your password is secure! We take security seriously. Our measures are robust.” (and other random, unquantifiable claims)  Loading login forms over HTTP renders any downstream transport layer security almost entirely useless. Anything you load over an HTTP connection can be easily changed by a man in the middle which is why it’s absolutely essential to load those login forms over a secure connection.   You don't have to believe me, but there is a leading IT pro pointing out that you are obviously incorrect.    Network sniffing (barring sniffing done at a global network level, i.e. NSA) can only be done locally. This implies that either your computer is infected with some software such that a man-in-the-middle attack is possible, or that your router is DNS poisoned, etc.   No, the attack is almost certainly being done by a different computer on the network that is infected, which is why the likelihood is in fact much higher than you think. What do you think a network trojan does? There is even a name for this, eavesdropping. What do you think compromised computers are running? An exploit kit.    Should Barstoolsports.com/login ideally be SSL secured? Of course.   I agree."
barstoolsports,3e5c6v,devthrowaway4,2,Wed Jul 22 15:00:20 2015 UTC,"The only insecurity on POSTing via SSL from a form loaded on an non-SSL page is a man-in-the-middle attack by way of hijacking the form functionality, which again implies that you are using an infected machine or using an insecure (read: public) network. This could be fixed using SSL on the page, yes, and it should. But it does also imply that there is another vector of attack which needs to be exploitable first. It is not a ""everyone is explicitly at risk"" vulnerability. Any man-in-the-middle attack is capable of spoofing SSL certs as well (dumb people click past cert warnings daily), not to mention root CA have been hacked in the past. SSL on initial load is not some panacea that solves all security concerns, though it does do a good job at thwarting most."

No, you're just not correct again. This happens all the time on corporate/small biz networks where there is an infected machine. The issue doesn't have to be local, and the network doesn't need to be public. The public vulnerability (planes, coffee shops, etc) is a huge issue itself. I've been in security for almost 10 years, I have a clue what I'm talking about.  Look, obviously you are a member of the development team. You are not correct over and over again, but you agree that it should be SSL. It's very simple. It doesn't matter that you're wrong, we agree on the important part, and let's get it done."

AFAIK Devnest and Devnest Nate are gone.  Also, you are again implying that there is an infected machine on the network. I am not arguing that this doesn't pose a security risk, I am merely stating that this is a prereq to there being vector for an attack. The average Joe browsing from home or on his phone will likely never run into this problem unless they are already infected/have infected machines on their network...which speaks to a larger problem than just ""Barstool is insecure"".  Also the technical aspects of everything I have said has been correct: MITM attacks are real and it is a concern for the login flow, but you are making it out to be a concern that will affect 99% of the barstool crowd which is just fear mongering.

When it comes to the Jimmy V and Arthur Ashe award however, that should mean something. Jenner receiving it is a publicity mishap. Yeah she's courageous in her own way..that's all well and good but she didn't deserve that award due to who else it could've gone too. Noah Galloway; disabled veteran, crossfit, runs marathons. Pete Frates we all obviously know about. It really frustrated me that this happened because society and the media is afraid of the LGBT community and it showed big time. I do not understand how someone could have the logic ""Jenner has done more to earn this award than the others."" Mindboggling to me.  Oh yeah, those stats about trans-people being homeless and the suicide rates? Don't act like it's a travesty please..The LGBT population makes up like 5% of our country. I'm not arguing that they should be ignored, but it's small drop in the bucket. Those aren't mind-blowing numbers compared to the numbers of veterans suffering from PTSD and suicide."
barstoolsports,3dma1j,MikeSteezy,6,Fri Jul 17 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% about the transgender population. When I was in grad school, my classmates elected me as their student senator (I did it because the student govt Pres was a huge liberal). I had to listen to a transgender student propose a bill mandating that we make and build gender non-specific bathrooms at every building on campus with the sole purpose of eliminating suicide rates from transgender students who are too ashamed to pick a ""men's"" or ""women's"" bathroom. No2 I'm 100% against people committing suicide and want to prevent it as much as possible.    My argument was we shouldn't spend millions of dollars to create new bathrooms to prevent a small number of transgender students from committing suicide, but that we should increase spending on counselling and other effective measures to reduce the overall rate of on campus. The amount of shit I got from this was astronomical. LBGT people were writing letters to the dean of my college about how unaccepting and hateful I was, and demanding I resign as senator and be thrown out of grad school. It was one of the more comical things I've ever been involved with, especially considering student government had absolutely no influence on any decision made on campus."

Honestly, they should just be happy they aren't being thrown in prison for their lifestyle, as they would be in the Middle East & Africa.

barstoolsports,3df88n,darkestsoul,6,Wed Jul 15 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah I suppose most people never think of this. It's up to infosec to ensure this is not a concern and Barstool is frankly putting each one of its logged in users in quite a bit of danger.  Fortunately it looks like Barstool's login page is separate, however, Barstool's login page is not delivered over SSL which is an equally ridiculous security concern. This means your login credentials (username + password, which you totally are not supposed to use on other sites but I'm sure do anyway) are sent unprotected to Barstool HQ. Seriously devnest? Totally unacceptable.   As an example of how this can go wrong, imagine I'm an Eastern European scammer looking to perform fraud. I find a shady third party ad network who is lax on this sort of sandboxing, and Barstool uses that third party vendor by including that network's javascript in the page. When an end user now fetches a page I'm interested in, I can exploit the fact that the security is lax by sniffing around the page. I could perform ""click fraud"" (which is what I am reporting here) and ""fake"" you clicking on an add and put you in the App store and collect $$ for doing so. If I was sandboxed, I couldn't do this - exactly why this is standard. Then I place keydown listeners on all keyboard events, and send the events back to my server. (If a site doesn't have a dedicated login page and has, say, a login modal box, I am now capable of sniffing login credentials in plain text.) Now, I can try to make use of a flash or Java exploit to attempt to compromise your machine. Then, I can sniff around for any local information (say, your email address, which might be passed as part of your user information, or your local login credentials). This is all just from one trusted site having lax security.  Now the real fun can begin. First of all, I've already made money because of the App Store redirect up front. Next, I can start looking at any user data I've gotten. If I have your email address, I could now set up an incredibly compelling / difficult to spot phishing mechanism. I might be able to log into other sites as you and perform actions using your compromised account. Worst case scenario, I have your login credentials, and now try to log into online banking portals with your information, set up wires to my accounts, and poof your money is gone. Or, I use known exploits to compromise your machine, and look for other machines on your network who are logging into sites unprotected by SSL (ding ding ding Barstool!) and take their credentials and start the process over again.  There's no evidence Barstool's own login credentials are compromised via an ad network, but it's totally possible that things have been and are actively being stolen because of the lack of SSL. Say you login at a Starbucks, and I'm sitting next to you sniffing network packets. Without SSL, I can see the login totally unprotected by encryption. This kind of shit is just not something you play around with. It's how you really fuck up people's lives because you just don't give a shit and are grossly negligent.  TL;DR - Ad/click fraud a clear issue, I don't have enough time to tell how much of a security concern this is. Lack of SSL on login page an extreme security concern, I would NOT log into Barstool whatsoever with the current setup, especially if you are someone who uses the same username/password combinations over and over again. Without SSL & encryption for the login event you are left totally unprotected."

HBOGO just released its app for Amazon Fire TV the other day, so you can have a subscription independently from them. You can also get a sling subscription and get a bunch of channels for pretty cheap. When you sign up there, you can get a free Fire TV Stick, or Roku Stick. Ditch the cable provider.

KFC Radio is not the only talk-show out there to utilize a fan submitted topic throughout the course of the broadcast (in fact most broadcasts do these days right?).    Adding this is not going to make or break the rundown but I think it would be something worth testing out.
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,goodfolk,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:29 2015 UTC,"it would make KFC radio useless, and KFC gets more advertising now than barstool, why would KFC allow this? He would leave barstool and do his own thing before letting dave just throw his hard earned mailtime, kfc radio into a 5 minute rundown segment that cuts out and is riddled by ads"
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,EatSleepZlatan,2,Thu Jul 16 16:29:43 2015 UTC,You think adding one stoolie submitted topic to the rundown or aftershow would completely derail KFC Radio and force KFC to leave?  That's a pretty hot take right there sir
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,thechariot83,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"1 question if it was based on a current event is fine, but just a general advice question, or FMK, that is KFC radio material."
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,mm_31,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:07:04 2015 UTC,Yup that's what I was going for
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,TooManyofYu,0,Thu Jul 16 23:33:41 2015 UTC,They've been testing it for 2 years now. There's no need for it. You have a show where there's 5-6 stoolie submitted questions. So whats the point of doing it on the rundown?
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,youngnewengland,3,Thu Jul 16 22:19:41 2015 UTC,Additional content for the rundown or aftershow
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,goodfolk,5,Thu Jul 16 23:33:20 2015 UTC,"The rundown is usually fine but without Pres they all just mail it in every time. Yesterday when KFC was high ranting was the first time I laughed out loud from the rundown since Dave left, so that's a start I guess."
barstoolsports,3dcg3h,jasongates4,2,Wed Jul 15 14:23:13 2015 UTC,"I'll take a drugged up KFC over Smitty, Trent, and Dana anyday on the rundown."
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,NatesGrossTeeth,16,Tue Jul 14 15:29:34 2015 UTC,useless
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,Braves010,16,Tue Jul 14 17:57:21 2015 UTC,Hot... thats about it
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,mkozub,8,Tue Jul 14 17:15:54 2015 UTC,She was clearly hired for her interesting opinions
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,manshapedboy,2,Wed Jul 15 00:35:20 2015 UTC,Need to see the butthole before I decide
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,fitnessguy1111,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:43:23 2015 UTC,Marbles 2.0.
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,ojos_mudos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:41 2015 UTC,"Barstool interns aren't needed to make copies or do administrative work- they are sources of content. It would be boring to have 3-4 generic stoolies working there, its more entertaining to have a diverse, eclectic group like pirate simon, hut girl dana and blind motherfuckin mike"
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,griph00k,20,Tue Jul 14 16:05:38 2015 UTC,i still laugh thinking of when simon came up to daves office uninvited on the rundown and sat on all his papers and shit
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,Deezer509,11,Tue Jul 14 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"She's not really a source of content though, and she certainly doesn't generate laughs.  She barely generates boners, as far as the internet is concerned."
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,griph00k,5,Tue Jul 14 16:34:22 2015 UTC,Ya I agree but I think pres was hoping she would have at least a fraction of a personality
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,griph00k,2,Tue Jul 14 16:41:31 2015 UTC,shes not funny on the rundown but not everyone can be funny in that medium. They should have her do some woman on the street interviews at feminist rallies (with pre-written questions by someone else) or stuff like that
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,Deezer509,2,Wed Jul 15 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"Heh, emphasis on the ""someone else""."
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,newstoodent345,0,Thu Jul 16 16:44:25 2015 UTC,Hot and cute personality. Not everyone is a stand-up comedian you fucking dimwits.
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,rogerdornsclubs,-6,Wed Jul 15 23:39:04 2015 UTC,The fact you're posting this on a reddit proves how smart of move this was by Portnoy. He hires for content and this was a home run for him.
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,YoPoppaCapa,10,Tue Jul 14 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"Content? She's had very little involvement the last few weeks.  She hasn't made much content at all, and what she has done was not really entertaining."
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,rogerdornsclubs,-4,Wed Jul 15 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"She doesn't need to drive the content. The fact you're following her every move is what he cares about. ""No such thing as bad publicity"""
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,YoPoppaCapa,2,Wed Jul 15 13:51:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly forgot she was part of the site until her rundown the other day. It's bad if the rare times she does do something it's not good, like at all."
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,rogerdornsclubs,-3,Wed Jul 15 13:59:31 2015 UTC,She has 23k twitter followers bud. You're the only one forgetting she is apart of the site.
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,YoPoppaCapa,-1,Wed Jul 15 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"If you don't think she was a swing and a miss by Portnoy you're kidding yourself.  A fun and interesting female would garner even more attention, and there was potential for that, but she just isn't that entertaining.  Far from a ""home run"", don't kid yourself."
barstoolsports,3d9hgq,Dr-TimWhatley,0,Wed Jul 15 15:43:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe it wasn't a home run but it certainly wasn't a swing and a miss. She's an intern, and she's generating far more content than whatever boring neckbeard Portnoy would have hired in her place. Believe it or not, fun and interesting females aren't lining up to get paid like $200 a week to work at Barstool HQ. This wasn't some massive investment that failed just because she isn't turning into Marbles 2.0"
