JonTron,3e04i8,OrginalCanadian,5,Tue Jul 21 16:39:53 2015 UTC,"This is not a new phenomenon. Take a look at /r/gamegrumps. How often is an actual episode the top post on the sub? Almost never.  You upvote someone's art or someone's joke or someone's comment to show them that you appreciate what they're doing. Upvoting an actual episode doesn't do that. Those points don't magically find their way back to the content producers. Watching the episode and using YouTube's ""like"" button is how you support them."
JonTron,3e04i8,Crystal_Clods,8,Tue Jul 21 07:32:37 2015 UTC,"The difference here though is that Game Grumps put out content on a regular schedule so there's no real need for an episode to reach the top unless it's something out of the norm like an announcement for something.  Jon puts out videos on a much less regular schedule and unless you are checking your youtube subscriptions everyday you probably wouldn't notice it, so getting it to the top in this sub is great for letting his fans know there's something new."

JonTron,3e04i8,Manamanky,2,Tue Jul 21 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"this sub has an ebb and flow of shitposting but honestly, it's a mass of people who are all starved for content. They all respect Jon for taking his time and have been really caring about waiting. In fact, the sub will downright attack someone who shit talks Jon for not putting content out fast enough. That being said, the sub does what it can to entertain itself and, in the beginning, this meant the thread equivalent to kicking a can around but over the period of 1.5 to 2 years it's devolved into this chaotic mess. They found that by reveling in shitposting they can laugh, annoy, and generally just wank off to something they all love, with a lot of people who all love it. This isn't a place for people who just casually enjoy Jon's work and wished to sit with like minded fellows and discuss the videos because quite frankly, there just aren't enough videos for this sub to survive on that alone. That being said, if you are obsessed with jontron, are totally into the run on and in jokes, and just want to sit around and throw shit at the wall until a new video comes up, this is the place for you. I like to take little factions from sanity here but there are those who live here. They are to be respected and feared for they have given up their manitou, but gained something else.   Also, everything kind of goes back to normal immediately after a. Idea gets released, but the window of normalcy has gotten smaller and smaller and the Star Wars thing, while appreciative, has seem to have exacerbated this. Wether it be due to the shorter episodes or what have you, I don't know. I just observe."

JonTron,3dt9q7,sjhunter6311,16,Sun Jul 19 13:28:41 2015 UTC,"From the perspective of people that don't like them, in short: Suzy is simply unfunny and she's also overly worried about offensive jokes. Her entrance into the scene basically made Arin less funny as a result."
JonTron,3dt9q7,slowest_hour,6,Sun Jul 19 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"My issue is that everyone plays the straight man. In original grumps, Jon was the spontaneous and wacky one, and while Arin had his moments, he was typically more calm.

JonTron,3dj5qo,Wowseers,5,Thu Jul 16 21:07:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I created this moveset with the newest Smash in mind, but if we were playing by Melee/Project M rules, I'd say pretty long. JonTron's a odd combination of a floaty and fastfalling character, with more emphasis on his fast falling speed. edit: bad u/IAmTheWii, bad! His traction is pretty low, and since his jumps are high with a deceptively wide control over his movement in the air, a well-executed JonTron wavedash is much preferred to his below average running speed. What more, his multihitting moves now gain a more extended range and an almost grab-like pull, and Jacques Target's usefulness is universally improved."
JonTron,3dj5qo,ActionGamemaster,7,Thu Jul 16 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"JonTron's a odd combination of a floaty and fastfalling character, with more emphasis on his fast falling speed.    This doesn't make sense dude. That's like saying he's a combination of tall and short. You would just call him medium height. Those two words are basically opposites."
JonTron,3dj5qo,Wowseers,4,Thu Jul 16 22:01:26 2015 UTC,hes floaty but he fast falls every time he jumps  that makes sense right
JonTron,3dj5qo,ActionGamemaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"If he fast fell when he jumped then when would he be floaty? You could say he's light as in he fast falls and doesn't have a lot of weight which basically means he just fast falls slower, maybe that's what you mean?"

JonTron,3dedtb,Debonaire_Death,3,Wed Jul 15 18:35:01 2015 UTC,If you want a friendly Jon mention here's a good recent video about Ross telling a story with Jon in it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alvU33lA54c&t=5m10s Jon gets mentioned after 8 minutes orso. But you don't have to of course.
JonTron,3dedtb,OrbitOli,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:25:17 2015 UTC,also don't eat anything while watching this episode
JonTron,3dedtb,NYX94,9,Thu Jul 16 00:24:38 2015 UTC,"It's quite nice, I think. Shows that in a way he's still part of Game Grumps.  Fun fact, on April 1st the character was unlocked. It was revealed to be Larry. From the Jepoardy NES game. Fucking Larry."
JonTron,3dedtb,Nemzal,6,Wed Jul 15 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"You're right. I'm gonna view it positively, as in Jon being a character that can be one day unlocked again.  Of course, the GG subreddit isn't in any way officially affiliated with Game Grumps, so it doesn't actually reflect their sentiments in any way. I can't help but wonder if the fact that GG is part of Polaris is part of why Jon can't come back. As I understand it, there are some non-disclosure agreements involved in why no one knows the details of the Grumps' split."
JonTron,3dedtb,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"What's funny about all of this BS is that Jon could probably say ""Hey, I created this show, end it now."" and they'd be forced to, as Jon created the show."

Still, I don' t think the Grumps have anything against Jon. Still, I know Grumps works for Polaris and, while they seem to give Arin and co. plenty of leeway to do what they want with the show, obviously something is keeping anyone from sharing what exactly went down between Jon and the Grumps. Jon has clearly stated that he wishes he could explain the situation but can't. I can't help but wonder if something happened between Polaris and Jon, and that's why Jon can't/wont work with the GG ever again.  All of the JonTron episodes are still on Youtube, though; does he still make money off of those? I'm not familiar enough with the Youtube economy."
JonTron,3dedtb,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"Unless the grumps/polaris are paying Jon, he's probably not getting cuts anymore. I do think that Polaris might be obstructing an old Grump meeting, as it seems otherwise that it's entirely possible."
JonTron,3dedtb,grumpnotso,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:47:11 2015 UTC,"It's been like that for a while. In the game themed banners, he's usually a secret character who isn't unlocked."

I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.    First class, yo this is bad  Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.  Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?  Hmmmmm... this might be alright.    But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that  Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?  I don't think so  I'll see when I get there  I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air    Well, the plane landed and when I came out  There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my  name out  I ain't trying to get arrested yet  I just got here  I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared    I whistled for a cab and when it came near  The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror  If anything I could say that this cab was rare  But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel Air'    I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8  And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later'  I looked at my kingdom  I was finally there  To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air!

JonTron,3dcn0w,burkinator17,15,Wed Jul 15 05:48:52 2015 UTC,I would really like to see him revisit Starfox Adventures. And finish it. There's so much Jon joke material
JonTron,3dcn0w,LC_Music,7,Wed Jul 15 05:51:52 2015 UTC,Jon always talks so much about trying to make every video something new and exciting and different from what he's done before. I suspect he wouldn't like the idea of revisiting a game he'd already done.   Although I agree with /u/LC_Music. Stairfax Temperatures could have been mined much more deeply than it was.
JonTron,3dcn0w,LinkSkywalker14,2,Wed Jul 15 06:30:23 2015 UTC,"Well, my brother and I have a history with that game, and both being Jon fans, we loved when he did a video of it, and we quote it all the time  I watched my brother finish it recently, and there were some parts where I couldn't help wondering what Jon would have to say about it."
JonTron,3dcn0w,LC_Music,5,Wed Jul 15 06:32:07 2015 UTC,Look up the end of of Sonic '06 on YouTube sometime.   It's one of the great tragedies of history that we'll never get to hear what Jon has to say about the end of that game.
JonTron,3dcn0w,LinkSkywalker14,5,Wed Jul 15 06:33:59 2015 UTC,"I would gladly give up any new JonTron episodes for 2 months just to get closure on that. The Broble needs its Revelations  Here's keeping my fingers crossed for Grumpcade crossover... hell, why not get Dan in on the action? It would be wonderful to have those three performing together, even if it's just for this one culmination of fan fulfillment.

JonTron,3d7lhw,MenardiOfProx,2,Tue Jul 14 08:26:23 2015 UTC,"Gyro (food):       A gyro [ˈʝiro] or gyros [ˈʝiros]  (Greek: γύρος, gyros, literally 'turn') is a Greek dish of meat or other alternative such as feta or haloumi cheese roasted on a vertical spit and usually served in a pita bread with tomato, onion, and tzatziki sauce.  To make gyros, pieces of meat are placed on a tall vertical spit, which turns in front of a source of heat, usually an electric broiler. If the meat is not fatty enough, strips of fat are added so that the roasting meat always remains moist and crisp. The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the strength of the heat and the distance between the heat and the meat, allowing the cook to adjust to varying rates of consumption. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done. It is generally served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with various salads and sauces.

You're not commissioning his work, he's not contracted to work underneath you, and he has no obligation to provide you with the details of his work. This ""Jon has to tell us every detail and needs to do more"" attitude is toxic, and it doesn't make his life any easier. Try to imagine for a second what that kind of pressure from THOUSANDS of people feels like. Its not conducive to productivity, and it sure as hell doesnt make him eager to interact with his audience.

JonTron,3cms84,Nibblet420,33,Thu Jul 9 12:17:14 2015 UTC,I'm just saying if Starcades are gonna be 5 minutes long It'd be great if they came out a little more frequently than monthly.
JonTron,3cms84,Alvanix,21,Thu Jul 9 06:36:45 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but Jon even said when he was announcing Starcade is that it wouldn't take the place of the regular episode. So far? No episodes during Starcade."

JonTron,3c80qf,MeeceAce,36,Sun Jul 5 22:16:49 2015 UTC,"Crimes against /r/JonTron from Nokel;   Dedicated most of his time to actively participating in other communities without getting a feel for /r/JonTron as a subreddit to know how things should and shouldn't work, despite being a mod for over a year Actively censored posts automatically containing ""banned words"" and used AutoModerator to shadowban users in /r/JonTron, the only reason so far being that he didn't like them Instituted rules randomly without any reason to (see my theory as to why this might have happened) and changed them whenever he felt like it, wording them very vaguely so he could enact them as he pleased without direct accountability for use/misuse of the rules. Didn't communicate with any other moderators and fought back against them when they attempted to undo his changes, as far as I know.   Now, here's where I get on the more conspiracy theory side of things and it's just my own observation, but I'm taking a stab in the dark at why Nokel was such a shit mod.   From what I can tell, Nokel is a huge K-Pop fan and seems to be heavily active in those communities, if not pretty much only active in them. It's not a crime in itself, course not, but my theory is since he's such a big fan of K-Pop, he's likely focused only on that kind of content and therefore subscribed to a ton of related subreddits. The so-called ""shitposts"" were ""getting in the way"" of the content he wanted on his front page, so he simply removed whatever he deemed to be cancer and didn't want to see. Effectively, just deleting posts because they were on his front page and he didn't like them. And of course, the streisand effect came into play and that's that, we know how the rest goes."
JonTron,3c80qf,B-24J-Liberator,15,Sun Jul 5 22:41:13 2015 UTC,That's nuts. Never knew that he would have a fucking LIST of reasons not to keep him as mod. It's like he would be part of FF6's cast of antagonists.

JonTron,3c80qf,MeeceAce,13,Mon Jul 6 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"It's also possible that he is subscribed to under 50 subreddits, and those subreddits have lower average upvotes than /r/jontron, so it was blocking his stuff he liked more from getting high on his /front."
JonTron,3c80qf,uss1701jb,7,Mon Jul 6 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Given what we know, this seems most likely. He didn't understand our humor so he decided to try to make us stop."

JonTron,3c6p45,JavertTron,5,Sun Jul 5 19:25:28 2015 UTC,I feel like the absurdity of the game itself is what propels the video.

JonTron,3c6p45,lordjackal,8,Sun Jul 5 15:37:18 2015 UTC,"I think it bugs us when he promises something and doesn't release them in a timely fashion (people paid for that Fireworks video, and he said it'd be up in February, plus the mythical Q&A) but for his regular videos, it's kind of just par for the course with Jon. 90% of the time he doesn't have a schedule, so we just take it as it comes, but the times when he says he'll release something and doesn't, really FUCKS me right off and not in a good way."

JonTron,3c6p45,MasterExploderizer,-2,Sun Jul 5 22:27:51 2015 UTC,Isn't that just a little entitled?
JonTron,3c6p45,tesselode,7,Sun Jul 5 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. If Jon can't handle deadlines I think he should go with the ""when it's done"" approach. I agree with MasterExploderizer in that it's annoying that Jon says he's gonna upload something at an approximate date and then misses that date by a long shot."
JonTron,3c6p45,Lawdee,-2,Sun Jul 5 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"Annoying how? You just don't get the video yet. I can see disappointed, but annoyed?"
JonTron,3c6p45,tesselode,2,Sun Jul 5 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"When you're an entertainment figure and you announce when you're releasing something, you need to stick to it. How would it work if movies were announced for a certain date and then were released 8 months later? People would be crying for blood. Obviously Jontron isn't releasing triple A movies but sticking to a schedule the best you can is just what you do. I don't mind when he releases videos regularly cause he just does it without warning, so there's nothing expected of him time-wise."
JonTron,3c6p45,MasterExploderizer,0,Sun Jul 5 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"Movies cost money. JonTron videos are free. There's no contract here, he just makes videos, and we get to enjoy them. No one deserves to watch them at a certain time, even if he says we'll get to. If something changes, so what?"
JonTron,3c6p45,tesselode,2,Sun Jul 5 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"While that may be true about the movies, it's still a matter of trust, luckily Jon doesn't announce schedules for videos too often, so that part is fine, but when he says he'll release something on a certain day, he should, it's just common sense."
JonTron,3c6p45,MasterExploderizer,0,Sun Jul 5 22:57:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that if you say you're going to do something you should, but I don't get how you're so annoyed. Now I might be getting the wrong tone from your original post because the internet and all, but you're making it sound like it legitimately hurts people when JonTron doesn't release a video on time."
JonTron,3c6p45,tesselode,3,Sun Jul 5 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"It might have been the FUCKS me right off part, I do love that Jontron quote, but no it's more of a minor annoyance. Like we all get when Jon hasn't released something, it's really a non-issue but when he announces stuff it just rubs me the wrong way, like I said, people actually did pay money for that Fireworks video."

We are all highly addicted to cocaine, and we all get it from the same dealer.  Only problem is, he is working for Jon, and he only gets paid when he releases a new ten minutes plus video, so every time there is a sizeable gap between videos, we get strong withdrawal symptoms. The longer it takes, the stronger they get.  At least that's what the pink elephant leprechaun that's sitting on my shoulder told me. And he is about to go on a rampage.  Now you might be laughing at that, ""What is that idiot talking about, there are no pink elephant leprechauns that go on rampages!""  That's because there is noone that could have witnessed it.

JonTron,3c2i8r,KindaFunnyUsername,2,Sat Jul 4 05:11:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't finished Earthbound (stupid Sword of Kings, look for hours straight and yesterday, it was the second thing I fight.) but I did finish Mother 3 the day before Lucas was released for Smash 4. And I would LOVE to see Jon's perspective on that hilariously heart-breaking experience that was Mother 3.   Thanks for watching this Jontron Episode! This Jontron Episode loves you!"
JonTron,3c2i8r,EndOfTheDigitalAge,2,Sat Jul 4 05:50:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Earthbound is quirky and cute, while Mother 3 rips your heart out and shows it to you.  I can imagine the Jontron episode would be an emotional rollercoaster. Haha"

JonTron,3c06bn,The_Dok,4,Fri Jul 3 19:23:52 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: you said a ""I look like a Swood Grommet""  Can they both snap in two? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a swood dude who studies memes, I am telling you, specifically, in /r/jontron, no one considers Grommets swood. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not. If you're saying ""grommet family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of shitpostae, which includes things from Crowbars snapping in two to that guy, you know the one. So your reasoning for calling a swood is because random people ""call grommets swood?"" Let's get Vertical hunger and crowbars in there, then, too. Also, calling something a shitpost or a grommet? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A grommet is a shitpost and a member of the shitpost family. But that's not what you said. You said Grommets are Swood, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the shitpost family swood, which means you'd call Crowbars, vertical hunger, and other shitposts swood, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"
