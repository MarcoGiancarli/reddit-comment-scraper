TerrainBuilding,3e0078,radecthered,4,Mon Jul 20 22:18:14 2015 UTC,This project looks great so far. You can add cabling to the decks using   wires from cast off electronics. Bamboo skewers can be used for railings. Those are a couple things that come immediately to mind. This really reminds me of the 'space station' themed levels on Starcraft.
TerrainBuilding,3e0078,lordxi,3,Tue Jul 21 07:27:27 2015 UTC,"Hi, to add diversity i agree that you could inspire from starcraft 2 maps which, i found, are really nice space platform.  Heres some examples : http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/a/a7/Scrapyard_SC2_Map1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090622230048 http://media-curse.cursecdn.com/attachments/61/994/bb9694a26538b482c3b21ff9d9e927bf.jpg http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/starcraft/images/3/34/StarStation_SC2-HotS_Art1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120913204943  So what can you do with this, i agree with the cabling and railing, i'll add some pipe that lead to mysterious machinery.  You should add a lot of underlying grid and real holes with glowing color, endless black pit... in the board. It will help get the feeling that your are ""on"" a real station not just on a piece of steel. For the texture of the ground i've seen that you have already worked on some, you can add some hexagon shape for some kind of high tech stuff, same with plexiglass bridge to look like energy buildings. Instead of trees you can add smoking chimney of toxic products.  Hope this help."

TerrainBuilding,3dv1xw,RossAlmighty,2,Mon Jul 20 12:15:31 2015 UTC,"Looks like an excellent start! My only comment would be the rock faces look a little flat. Since you're using foam (I assume) one cheap trick is to find an actual rock, or a large bark chip works just as well, something with a lot of rock-like texture. Take that and really smoosh it into the foam after assembly but prior to painting. The idea is to transfer the texture into the foam, all over the piece before painting. If you hit the hard edges as well with this technique it makes everything look more like a natural formation.  The other thing I like to do with pieces like this is bevel the edges of the terrain bases a bit, so you can place figures moving across the table/terrain joint without tipping them over too much."
TerrainBuilding,3dv1xw,AdmiralCrackbar,2,Mon Jul 20 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"The flat edges was really deliberate, based on the source images I was working from but that techniques is one I'll bear in mind.

TerrainBuilding,3dpgh7,bluezero666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:39:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome! But kinda stupid question: When and why did 3mm come about? I know of 2mm and 6mm, but have never heard of 3mm before."
TerrainBuilding,3dpgh7,outofbort,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"Hi! 3mm is rather recent as a viable scale.  They've actually been around for awhile but no one really played them and the selection was very specific.  3mm is also known as 1/600 scale, which is used in naval war games a lot.  Probably the scale would have never gotten as big as it did except for this guy named Marcin, in Poland, who started using computers to design ultra-modern minis.  To make his designs viable he had to cast them in a different kind of metal- I can't remember what it is off the top of my head- NOT pewter- but some kind of ultra-hard, brittle alloy.  It holds details better than lead does so that even at 3mm you have the detail of good quality 10mm but with better proportions.  A few years back he came out with 3mm ACW, then added Napoleonics.  You can't compare them to 2mm. The figs are highly detailed so that you can see individual details on each figure (like belts, tunrbacks, cuffs, etc) but so small that you can paint them very easily en masse if you prefer.  It's possible to pick out individual regiments of 3mm Napoleonics based on their uniforms alone, which you can't in 2mm.  At any rate, the frontage of the individual infantry strips (10 men per 20mm strip) means that you can put together a nearly 1:1 battalion of Napoleonic infantry on the same frontage as a 36 figure battalion in 28mm.  And for only about $20.  So 3mm really is the only scale that allows you to realistically play 1:1 battalions on a normal sized (EDIT) table and with a reasonable amount of painting.  The set-up I have on here uses 60mm = 100m, or the frontage of an average French infantry battalion in the Napoleonic era.  The figure ratio is 10:1."

TerrainBuilding,3dpgh7,Iamdickburns,2,Sat Jul 18 19:51:09 2015 UTC,"http://www.picoarmor.com  Pico Armor does 3mm ACW and Napoleonics.  The Naps range is still releasing new figs, so it's not complete yet- new codes come out every few months and Marcin is good about taking user feedback on his sculpts.  You can do a lot with what they have already though.  http://www.magistermilitum.com/scale/3mm.html  Magister Milllitum just started off in 3mm earlier this year.  They do ancients, which is interesting, and already have a pretty good-looking 18th Century line (would be a ton of fun to do 6 rank deep WSS formations at 1:1 with pikes, right?).  First reports indicate they are pretty good mixed with WSS figs.    This guy does an awesome review of them here:  http://leadnobleed.blogspot.com"

TerrainBuilding,3dpgh7,AngryRedDudes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:58:49 2015 UTC,What on earth would you play at 3mm and 2mm scale?
TerrainBuilding,3dpgh7,i_stare_at_screens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:43 2015 UTC,"Horse and musket personally, but most people use them to play ultra moderns because you can show the large distances that modern day warfare takes place over.    Like I said, there's a huge difference in figure quality between 3mm and 2mm.   I couldn't see doing 2mm figs either.    For H&M the advantage over larger scales is that in 3mm you can get a pretty high figure ratio (10:1) while still having generally correct foot prints, not only for the individual battalions but for the brigade formations and higher as well.  Not sure if you do historic or not but these two things are debated and discussed a lot in Napoleonics, mostly because the larger the figure scale the more footprints are smudged and time/distance considerations get thrown out of whack."

Don't forget to get some sewing pins to pin the joints together where you glue; it makes the seals a lot stronger. Also, don't just go straight in with the pins, angle them up or down slightly so you can't just pull the walls off easily (I put the top pins in on a slight downward angle, and the bottom pins on an upward one) - it will really help make a stronger model that will last better and hold up to being moved around."

TerrainBuilding,3ckehi,GunnedMonk,2,Wed Jul 8 20:32:37 2015 UTC,"Foamcore is excellent for building walls.  Use Elmer's glue or the like to seal the foam ends if you're going to spray paint it, though (or if you just want it to look less like foam).  I use basic sewing pins and glue to connect the walls to each other and to the base, which makes it basically impervious to major damage in storage.  Plus, the structural integrity lets you get really complicated (extra floors that are collapsed from battle, eg) without worrying about the damn thing falling apart on you.  To get a more realistic texture to the walls, I use a granular texture paste from my local art store.  Just smear it over the walls randomly before you paint, and it looks like worn concrete.  A jar of it goes a long way.  Varying thicknesses of cardboard glued to the foamcore can be good for adding things like frames around doors and windows, or other details in the structure to make it look less boxy and more realistic."
TerrainBuilding,3ckehi,Mwovie,5,Wed Jul 8 22:06:37 2015 UTC,I always lean on a lot of reference photos when I make terrain. Do the research first and you'll come out with a better product. Stalingrad has tons to offer. Pictures and films galore.  Can't wait for pics!

TerrainBuilding,3ckehi,EldarCorsair,3,Wed Jul 8 19:10:42 2015 UTC,"Rubble.  Think you've got enough ruined building with a little scattering of pebbles and sand? You don't. Think what you want and double that. Also, building rubble should be more than sand and pebbles - bricks, wood beams, doors, pipes, broken furniture, glass.  Posterboard foam is your go-to for building walls. Remember ruined buildings tend to suffer the most damage/destruction on the middle of walls; corners are inherently more structurally sound. Don't forget to embellish the exteriors - early 20th century urban buildings had lots of decorative elements.  Put a 1.5"" piece of foamcore down as your surface and hollow out basements, making the buildings (or at least the first floor) removable. All the urban fighting of WW2 revolved around using basements as strongpoints.  Be sure to include the creepy Stalingrad fountain"

TerrainBuilding,3ckehi,clobbersaurus,4,Thu Jul 9 00:36:20 2015 UTC,"1 - Use basswood beams from the hobby/craft stores. They are sold in all different sizes and shapes. When you get the wood, cut it to size and take a piece of steel wool and run it along the grain to removal the fine wood strands. (You don't want to use balsa as it's too light and the grain is too open). You can easily paint weathered wood by using grey, black, and brown artists inks and literally just stain it.  2 - Use brass tubing, cut to size. You can bend and twist it into shape and you don't have to paint it.  Also, if you want the buildings to look really good, use spackle on the interior walls to represent plaster."

TerrainBuilding,3cb5xy,Trystan_,6,Mon Jul 6 16:39:11 2015 UTC,The trees arent actually permanent fixtures.  all the hills are foam so i can simply stick the trees into them and re-position them later if I want (although i wont do this too much as ill end up with a bunch of tiny holes everywhere).  I am using this board for warhammer40k so I spaced the trees in such a way to provide some parts of the board with a fair amount of cover (cover gives units protection in 40k) and some open ground.  That way players can either charge up the middle and try to get clear shots on their opponents or they can try to sneak through the tress.

TerrainBuilding,3c8hek,Trystan_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"It's fun because i've strated building my terrain with a woodland in mind. I didn't built it with a game system (W40K, malifaux, ...etc) in mind but at least i can discuss some ideas i've used.  First to me a woodland, at least when your target some kind of reality, is a heck lot of trees. In opposition to the GW or traditionnal ""forest"" of three trees which doesn't look like anything of a forest to me.   Then the usual trees are going to be almost always to small for the scale you want. You can compromise on that or not but to me it's always something that is bugging me. The problem is that clearly bigger trees are way more costly or time consuming if you build them.  I wont going into the other than forests items because it would be too long for a reddit post like this one.  So to me i knew i wanted a lot of trees, I wanted different heigths and kind of trees but i didn't want to spent alot either. So i did get two package of noch tree : http://www.conrad.com/ce/en/product/242874/NOCH-26336-Laubbaum-Sortiment-55teilig-Hoehe65-150-mm and http://www.conrad.com/ce/en/product/242875/NOCH-26337-Model-Spruce-Tree-Assortment-55-pieces?ref=searchDetail. Considering the amount you are paying like 50 cents a tree I doubt you can build for less.  So that allowed me to start making pieces with much more trees per base. But i still think that's not enough diversity so i'm looking into http://woodlandscenics.woodlandscenics.com/show/Item/TR1123/page/1 with and without foliage. They seems interesting to me because they are big, I can add multiple on a stick to create a huge tree."

TerrainBuilding,3bx9kn,SuperRic,2,Fri Jul 3 07:16:06 2015 UTC,"I posted pics of the rope bridge in an other post with different things. I made it from balsa wood and twine. I took the twine and spun it around and around a lot of times so that it was to spin onto itself, then I let it do just that but controlled so that I got a double thickness twine. Then I glued pieces of balsa wood which had been scored with a wine opener first, onto two ""ropes"" of twine with pva. Then I coated the entire thing in a thin layer of pva to make it a bit more stiff but still soft enough to move. Then I added a piece of balsa wood on the underside on the ends of the bridge to make it able to attach to little ledges on the terrain. Then I painted, wood is burned umber and black wash, rope is sandri dust (citadel) and agrax earthshade.   The bridge works not so good with metal figures, but it works fine with plastic. For metal figures the biggest problem is that the bridge pulls the buildings too much, so if I had some kind of weights on the buildings that wouldn't be a problem either. Anyway, in gameplay the figures mostly move quickly across the bridge, and most people use plastic figures."

TerrainBuilding,3bx9kn,Lorven,2,Fri Jul 3 09:18:58 2015 UTC,"First I primed it black with normal indoor paint mixed with some water and pva glue. Do NOT use spray primer or other turpentine based paints on foam, it will melt. The pva in the priming is to strengthen the structure, as foam isn't exactly durable. Then I drybrushed with dark grey, roof got reddish brown, wood got dark brown, and the sheet metal is citadel leadbelcher. Then I drybrushed a bit lighter with a slightly lighter grey. Then I gave the entire piece a black wash made from lots of water and some drops of black paint (I use wargamer matte black as it has a lot of pigment but is thin). Just applying the wash generously basically everywhere. Then I went over and applied some wash on selected stones to make a more varying look. Then I took a light grey color and did a very light drysbrushing of the whole thing. I took long time to brush lightly with very little paint in the brush to get only the raised areas. Btw, I used mainly a 1 inch wide cheap hobby brush for the painting and drybrushing, only used a miniature brush for the smaller things like crevices, the stairs and the wood.

Very easy to work with! I have heard some people calling it Foam Card, but, most of the people call it Foamcore.    Featherboard is something used for protection when working with electric saws if i am correct.    Hardboard/Masonite - highly pressed small wood debris or chips, commonly for bases for the scenery elements. In a way similar to MDF board. Can also be replaced with thin plywood (but it is more difficult to work with since it can be easily chipped). Depending on what people use, they will refer to it as it is. So no mysticism there - if someone is using MDF, they'll just say it ;)    Pink Stuff/Styrodur/Hard Foam/Insulation Foam/Blue Foam - the most correct term is Insulation foam but most people just call it ""foam"", and their colors can colors vary. It can be pink, orange, yellow, white or blue. Each one of these has its different use and level of porousness. The denser ones are usually used for the outdoor insulation while the more porous one for the inside. My suggestion is - use the more porous ones (yellow and white) for rocks and other crude stuff (since it is a lot cheaper, at least where i come from), the denser one (pink, orange or blue) for buildings and other stuff that require more detail.    NEVER USE STYROFOAM (the white stuff that leaves small white balls all around your room, hair, clothes etc.):) It will leave only mess, and you will never be able to get rid of the texture.

Hot Glue/Glue gun - a gun with a glue, great for gluing things you can't see, and it can make some interesting texture if you are using it for sculpting. I never use glue gun, because of the little strands which it tends to leave and i hate cleaning them. Although 95% of people are using it, and like i said it is great for some stuff. PBA glue/White glue - it is a white glue used in carpentry industry for gluing the wood. this is what i use almost 100% of time, it can be mixed with superglue to leave the great texture. It comes in different thickness of density, sometimes it can be like watered yogurt. I prefer when it is thicker because it is easier to control. If you want to make it thicker, put it in the fridge for a couple of hours. Silicone - rarely good for gluing but great for water effects. It can be mixed with acrylic paints and it can make great effects. Scalpel/Exacto blade(knife) - very sharp with removable blades. It is all the same. You will use it 100% of the time. Hot wire/Electric wire - not recommended, because foam fumes are very toxic and can cause cancer (at least i was told). It also makes fake effects in a way. At least my opinion ;)"

TerrainBuilding,3b9f3u,Caylus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:53:59 2015 UTC,"Cheers, /u/Caylus. Here is how I did it... listed paints are craft paints.   Basecoat the entire thing with black  Paint the dirt with Burnt Umber, and the concrete with grey (mixed from black and white, mix to taste). I also picked out some larger rocks in grey.  Drybrush the dirt with Beige, then the whole thing with Khaki.  Wash with Agrax Earthshade over everything  Drybrush the whole thing with Parchment.   I painted the jerry cans separately and added them after. I used GW paint for them.   I glued the cans into the shape I wanted then painted them with a black basecoat.  Layer them with Boltgun Metal.  Using Khorne Red and Tausept Ochre I stippled the cans randomly  Drybrush with Boltgun Metal  Wash with rust wash (custom mix)  Wash with black wash   And done."

TerrainBuilding,3azlph,TheRealMouseRat,7,Wed Jun 24 19:50:41 2015 UTC,Excellent terrain. Always wanted to do Mordheim style but held back because it was Games Workshop and is now discontinued. What wargame rules are in the same style of Mordheim?  Any  help would be appreciated.
TerrainBuilding,3azlph,bookim40,2,Wed Jun 24 23:25:37 2015 UTC,"I use a ruleset called Wyrdwars. It has a bit more alternatives and flavor than normal Mordheim, and is actually really balanced. (Normal Mordheim was so unbalanced that everyone did the same tactics. Here you can do whatever you want and succeed, as long as the way you play synergize with the unit composition and equipment you have. No more ""everyone plays skaven with slings and two clubs and no armor"")  The wyrdwars forum is a bit barren although that's the ruleset which is the most updated and supported at the moment.

TerrainBuilding,3azlph,kwithnok,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"wide cuts? you mean between the stones? or do you mean the tear in the ground? For the tear I used an extendable knife, I thought that was what was called an exacto blade. I used one like this for most of the cutting. The tear was made by several helping cuts, and then ""shaving off"" thin sheets to smooth down to the curve I wanted. As for the stones, I first made a cut with the knife/blade, and then used a pen to push the pieces apart which makes a more natural rounded off corner on the stones. This video is great for learning a good technique for carving stones in foam."

On a side note, I was literally just thinking today that fish tank castles and such might work as set pieces, so it was interesting to see you talking about aquarium gravel!"

TerrainBuilding,3a1dm1,Sirlolish,4,Tue Jun 16 13:46:32 2015 UTC,I think it looks really nice. Maybe you could flock the rock face with some sand before you paint it to hide the foam texture?
TerrainBuilding,3a1dm1,Republiken,2,Tue Jun 16 14:01:09 2015 UTC,"In addition to what's already been said, a technique I've seen (on model railroading forums) is to plaster over the edge, then sort of wipe at it with some crumpled alfoil. That's still a pretty decent chunk of rocks; I think I'd try to break it down a bit more - pile it up more towards the bottom, y'know?"
TerrainBuilding,3a1dm1,SteelOverseer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"It looks pretty good overall.  One thing you can do to get a more natural rock texture with the foam, instead of cutting it you can tear it.  Just start with a piece bigger than you need and pull out chunks with your fingers, then paint as normal."

TerrainBuilding,39xzz1,GreyWulfen,5,Tue Jun 16 21:07:57 2015 UTC,Very nice. I have been working on doing something like that but with fall foliage.. how are you keeping the leaves/flock on the branches? Mine either look very clumpy or end up falling off.   I am working in 28mm if it matters.  Thanks for any advice.

TerrainBuilding,39xzz1,Scotsmann,4,Tue Jun 16 18:52:59 2015 UTC,Very nice.  Very nice indeed.  The only thing that I would change (if it were mine) would be the flag.  It needs to be rumpled and drape down more.  Right now it looks like the wind is hitting a 7 on the Beaufort scale.

TerrainBuilding,39kw67,PaintAndPlastic,2,Fri Jun 12 14:01:14 2015 UTC,"Not really. Only terrain created to a very professional standard would sell for any decent money. You often can't inspect the quality of the materials or how it would look on a table from just photos either.

Resin and silicone for molds is kinda pricy (roughly $30 per pound for each), but remember that you're effectively allowing yourself to reproduce your work's geometry over and over with significantly less effort/time involved.   Im in the process of getting good at molding so I can cast my sculpture work and sell it in kit form/preassembled and painted. The few tests Ive done are super fun."

Worth looking into if you're interested.  Additionally, there are multiple grades of plaster. The standard Plaster of Paris is rather brittle, but I've found that dental plaster or Merlin's Magic plaster is a lot stronger and holds great detail."
TerrainBuilding,39kw67,tzimon,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"But, would you sell the blocks simply right out of the mold (like I've seen many people on ebay do), or build something fancier?

TerrainBuilding,39gdle,SkullLeader001,3,Thu Jun 11 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"A good design to start with.  I think almost all terrain makers do this one at some point.  Now you get to add extra stuff to the next one,  then make a large ruined house with floors and ruined ceiling.    Then you stop and realize you have a tables worth of your own terrain to play on.  My Orks seem to die just as fast when on one of my tables,  but they have more fun.   One last thing,  if you have not already got one,  get a hot glue gun."

TerrainBuilding,39gdle,SuperRic,2,Thu Jun 11 21:19:05 2015 UTC,Great work! I would recommend for future builds to support any ledges with something underneath them (a second wall or maybe a beam) just to strengthen them. That way they'll be less likely to break off.

TerrainBuilding,39gdle,wisewizard,2,Thu Jun 11 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"wow for a first peice this is excellent work, really nice job with the coloring. only 2 things i see to improve for next time.  1st the edges of the base, you can either use a darker undercoat to make it less obvious or flock the edges. i like to do this before i flock to top by rolling the edge through the flock so it gets right into the gaps.  2nd thing and it's pretty minor, i'd give that overhang a bit more support because i guarentee at some point someone is going to want to put a mini up there for fireing position and you don't want them breaking bits off your terrain, use a metal ork warboss or metal chaos terminator as your bench mark for weight. Keep up the good work man an keep posting."
TerrainBuilding,39gdle,wisewizard,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:04:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! I'll definitely be adding something for the edging in the future. Do you (or anyone else) have recommendations for other types of bases aside from cardboard?
TerrainBuilding,39gdle,Leferikson,2,Fri Jun 12 05:50:29 2015 UTC,"absolutley. Cardboard is fine for smaller features but it tends to warp and won't sit flat on the table if you go larger because the glue and paint shrinks and contracts as they dry so for bigger peices i use foam core, corregated platic or plywood.  all three have their pros and cons.   foamcore is my favorite to build with, it's light weight easy to work and once primed is easy to paint but it's a bit tricky for me to source (i scavange most of my mats to keep cost down) and not super durable.   Corregated plastic is easy to source  and very strong and durable (it's what they make real estate signs from)  but can be a real shit to work with, i've cut myself many times trying to shape it plus it's harder to paint because of it's sheeny surface   Plywood is my base material of choice for any major terrain peice purely for durability, it's harder to work and paint and can be expensive but is super durable and will always stay flat, i use the stuff thats abot 6-8mm thick."

Started life as a laser-cut MDF kit from the great products over at GameCraft Miniatures  We built it to retain it's ""flat pack"" nature as much as possible, since transporting a 5'x2' chunk of terrain is very impractical. The walls slot into a series of 1'x1' base pieces.  We broke up the hollow interior with various rooms, machines, and assembly lines, to make play inside it a gritty fight. While the doors are big enough to drive a land raider through, it would still take 5 turns to cross the length of it, and that's with no failed terrain tests!  We are pairing this with another 6 square feet of refinery terrain on the outside, for a more open environment on the other side of the board."

TerrainBuilding,38nwk7,milesunderground,3,Fri Jun 5 23:30:19 2015 UTC,"The pricier of the low-cost options would be more conventional modelling kits; tanks, sci-fi pieces, anything like that you can get on discount and bash apart for parts.  (You generally won't use a whole model, if for no other reason than it would look a little odd to see a Sherman tank half buried in rubble on an alien world.)    The less-pricier option would be kids toys from thrift shops or the Dollar Store.  These will generally be less detailed than the models, but at a lower price point you can make it up in volume.  Most toys have a surprising amount of detail that painting will bring out, and any sort of mechanical toy can be taken apart for a bunch of gears and widgets that make for great rubble dressing."

I just pointed the how to guide on the 40K forum, so here it is:   Start with a thin plywood round, available from Michael's for...not much money. Built up an irregular barrier around the edge with green stuff or another hard setting putty. Let this dry. While it's drying, glue down some of the resin tree stumps available from Secret Weapon Miniatures and some of the Elven Ruins from Scibor Miniatures. Cover in superglue. Sprinkle gravel basing material liberally over basically everything. Let this dry. Prime. I use Krylon's grey primer. Base all the ground cover in slightly watered down Rhinox Hide.  Drybrush the ground cover with Doombull Brown. Drybrush the ground cover with two layers of Kislev Flesh. Base the statues with Celestra Grey. Wash the statues with Nuln Oil. Drybrush the statues with Celestra Grey. Drybrush the statues with Administratum Grey. Heavily wash the ground cover with Waywatcher Green. Let it dry. Do it again. Detail work! Paint the gems up with Teclis Blue -> Lothern Blue -> White. Red eyes were Khorne Red -> Wazdakka Red -> Evil Sunz Scarlet. 'Ard Coat the gems. Glue various bits of moss and lichen and tall grass into place - again, I got mine from Secret Weapon Miniatures. Apply several thin layers of Woodland Scenics Realistic Water. Profit?

TerrainBuilding,387030,AurynMacmillan,5,Tue Jun 2 08:30:26 2015 UTC,"Up until very recently my wife was a professional model maker for both architectural models and film practical effects. I'd be happy to relay any questions you might have to her!  But I can say that architectural model techniques aren't really usable for tabletop gaming. The way you go about building a model depends on a lot on your objectives, and architectural objectives are quite different than gaming objectives. Also, access to tools really changes your approach. Off the top of my head, here are some things to consider.  Architectural models are:   generally really, really fragile bulky and don't have to be repeatedly stored, transported, handled, etc. realistically scaled, which means they can be very tall, and block player LOS impractical for the home terrain maker as they often use very expensive fabrication tools: laser cutters, industrial air brushes & paint booths, 3d printers, CNC mills, etc. sometimes shockingly expensive   Gaming models have lots of usability requirements, in addition to the durability and LOS issues mentioned above. They:   need tolerances for fat fingers, and wide-based and/or dynamically posed figures benefit from clearly delineated terrain boundaries (ex. does this object provide cover?) should communicate large-scale environment information clearly from three feet away (""this area is clearly impassible"", ""this area is obviously good for cover"", ""this area is obviously rough terrain"") are designed with tactical considerations - mobility, choke-points, LOS, etc. need to be stable for miniatures to stand   So gaming models tend to make heavy use of scale distortions - oversized doorways, oversized columns, shortened buildings, shortened trees, terraced and exaggerated topos, etc."
TerrainBuilding,387030,outofbort,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:05:16 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks so much for the reply. The main thing I was really wanting to know was where on earth these things come from, no one ever seemed to have an answer. So you've clarified that.  Very much appreciate the insight into the practical differences between architectural grade models and hobby grade models also."
TerrainBuilding,387030,outofbort,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! Yup, they basically come from in-house studios at architecture firms, independent model making studios, or freelancers (who often contract out some of the work to laser cutting shops). There are specialists, too - I know someone who basically just makes super-realistic model trees for a living. Crazy.  Decent models can cost thousands in the US. A fair amount of this work in the US is now off-shored because it's much cheaper, although they do usually require repair when they are shipped back."

Do it when anything is drying- paint, glue, water, aerosol, anything.    When I craft my work, I usually leave a lip on the footprint, maybe 1/2 to 1 inch of area where I can place heavy objects like books while it dries at various stages. This prevents the cupping of bases. Just make sure it is heavy- so several books on each corner if you are able."

If you have access to a CNC router, they could be cut out in an hour or two, otherwise you can use a jigsaw to cut each layer ( you also do not have to make each layer solid, you can do ""rings"").  Also if you can get a few friends to help, it would go much faster.  Edit: Do not use wood glue or other PVA glues to laminate the layers together. the inside will take a long time to dry (weeks to months). Instead, use Vinyl Adhesive Caulk. It is designed to adhere the foam insulation boards together. It should only take 1 day to dry completely which you can then apply your paint."

TerrainBuilding,37ecvq,kwithnok,2,Wed May 27 12:45:28 2015 UTC,"I made a 6x4 board like this a few years ago. I cut the 1"" styrene using a band saw, stuck it all on 3mm MDF and then textured it with textured paint and plaster bandages. Totally fracked up the gluing and flocking, and ended up binning $100+ worth of terrain.  If I was doing it today, I would make it out of 3mm MDF (Use a breath mask when cutting it.) I would tack/nail the boards together with limited UNDILUTED wood glue. It will be heavy (Leave gapes if needed), but will be very strong.  You can make it quick and dirty, or make it to last.  Some tips from my costly mistake: Plan the board first, do not use so much glue it warps, do not compound a mistake if it fracks up. Band saws are great time savers (Rent or borrow one if you do not have one.)  If you really want to use 1"" styrene, how many layers? Will the edges be shaped or straight? Is it for a game where the edges matter?"
TerrainBuilding,37ecvq,Speedhump23,1 point,Wed May 27 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"I was thinking a 1"" layer would represent a 20' elevation difference, since that would match it nicely with the USGS topographical maps. Edges would likely be shaped, since the feel I'm trying to get across in the game is fighting a skirmish in a familiar nearby location."
TerrainBuilding,37ecvq,Nirriti_the_Black,2,Wed May 27 15:33:53 2015 UTC,There is no easy answer.  A keyhole saw is probably the cheapest tool for cutting these out.  Perhaps starting with the top layer and working down would be the fastest way to lay them out because you can put the smaller piece on the larger one and draw an outline quickly without having to make a template of measure.

TerrainBuilding,376hq8,Caylus,4,Mon May 25 07:35:09 2015 UTC,I think the general rule is that any glue you coat your board with- needs to go on the bottom too.  I believe the glue is what is warping your board. Even simple pva.
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,roastbill,1 point,Mon May 25 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, that could be it. I haven't been using a glue but am using a textured spraypaint.  Do you think if I spray the bottom it'll warp back flat? (I'm slightly dibious about this to be honest!)"
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,roastbill,2,Mon May 25 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"I hove only really dealt with glue warping.  I have never tried to counter warp something, I would try maybe spraying both sides of a small piece and see if it warps."
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,Speedhump23,2,Mon May 25 21:30:40 2015 UTC,"One other sugestion I make is to not water down glues. Often the glue and water mix is not done well and this helps warp the board. Also, how thick is the board?"
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,Speedhump23,1 point,Mon May 25 14:15:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure, probably about 2 or 3 mm. It's shiny on one side and textured on the other if that helps!"
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,wisewizard,2,Mon May 25 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"That sounds like masonite. Brown board, flat on one side, textured on the other. I have used it for 25 + years without warping.  In australia it is about 3mm thick.  Are you using wood glue mixed with water, or straight?"
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,wisewizard,1 point,Mon May 25 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"Just googled Masonite and that's definitely it. I was using a textured spray paint as it seemed like a viable, lazy option for my first base! :o"
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,_Luigino,2,Tue May 26 06:23:44 2015 UTC,"Had the same problem for years, eventually plywood for bases and kept cardboard, plastic card, foamcore, styrafoam etc for raised terrain, walls and seconds stories of buildings. It's harder and heavier and takes longer to work but is way better if you plan to build terrain to last. i splurged and bought a Dremel tool to carve grooves for extra support when doing walls and tall structures but normal PVA works ok as well."
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,Truthshift,1 point,Mon May 25 15:08:31 2015 UTC,I already have a Dremel so might look into this. What's the best thickness (what do you use) for ply?
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,SmallRealities,2,Mon May 25 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"not sure of the actual thickness, i just grabbed the most inexpensive sheet i could get, but it was 4 layers thick so i'd roughly guess 7 or 8mm but there's no harrm going thicker, i was just trying to keep the weight down because it had to travel."
TerrainBuilding,376hq8,TheRealMouseRat,2,Tue May 26 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"I built this piece using cheap artist canvas bought at the dollar store, it's easy to cut and you won't incur in any of the problem usually associated with wood or mdf, this particular pieces was painted, coated in pva, repainted and the caoated in 2 parts epoxy (for the water effect) and it never warped."

TerrainBuilding,36r31z,Naryn_Tin-Ahhe,2,Thu May 21 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"Most definitely.  One I've been getting a ton of use out of is my brick punch I made by pulling the bristles out of a paintbrush and forming the ferrule (metal part) into a rectangle. I use it constantly for creating brick patterns on foam.  All of my favorite and most-used tools tend to be super low-tech. I get a ton of use out of a plain old ball point pen I use to scribe lines into foamcore, and do a lot of foam shaping with folded bits of sandpaper.  My favorite to use, though, has to be my airbrush. It's just a lot of fun to paint with, although the cleanup is always a lot of work."

TerrainBuilding,36r31z,Naryn_Tin-Ahhe,1 point,Thu May 21 20:29:34 2015 UTC,No that stuff is called florists foam.
TerrainBuilding,36r31z,lordxi,1 point,Wed May 27 04:39:37 2015 UTC,I get mine off ebay. You can get different thickness so search for something like 3mm foamcore / foamboard.  I paid 50p per A4 sheet and bought about a dozen. Great to work with

The spray ate into the foam, creating really cool asteroid-like structures for a space game... or volcanic rock, if you need that."

They have to replace blades more often when used on polystyrene. It's inconvenient for us gamers, and a rare event anyway, but I don't blame a manager that makes that decision.
