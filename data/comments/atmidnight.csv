But she is terrible on @midnight. She plays the game ultra seriously. She has a really anxious and needy will to win and winds up sucking a lot of light-hearted energy out of the panel. In the rapid fire segments, she always tries to get points by giving factual answers in place of jokes.

It was great and Hardwick is a pro at what he does. Listening to the Nerdist for years I'm kind of used to how upbeat and positive he is...even though I don't think it makes him funnier necessarily. The woman in the middle during that episode had to re-shoot a lot of her jokes cuz she kept stumbling over her words...and almost every joke of hers was about female genitalia. Pete Holmes is cheesy but he's growing on me. Hannibal is just the best PURE FUNNY guy on that stage, and his Hedberg-esque style doesn't always work in a group setting like that but he killed it. The ""I am a dog that can write"" joke was just brilliant. Overall it was a lot of fun, and I'd definitely go again!"

The seating is shady and water is provided so it's not a bad wait! Filming is pretty quick, runs about an hour the times I've gone. Good luck and enjoy the trip!

atmidnight,39qofu,Malnutrisha,5,Sat Jun 13 21:10:26 2015 UTC,Much more likely is that they're pre-written like most of the show and the typing is just theater.
atmidnight,39qofu,b1gj4k3,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:14:03 2015 UTC,Exactly. Do you really think they typed that many words that quickly. (That could be explained by editing... but so could the fake answers in the first place.)

I feel like the show could use a bit less editing and crap. I know it's television, but I miss the days of Match Game when the episode went just as long as the episode went, so it wasn't always wrapped up in 22 minutes because the celebrities had been busy goofing off or whatever."
atmidnight,39qofu,_Burgers_,2,Sat Jun 13 23:17:24 2015 UTC,Match Game also had the celebrity panel shooting a week's worth of episodes at a time and a format that allowed a game to be split up into multiple episodes if necessary. @midnight does not have either luxury.

I've discovered awesome new bands and have found a new interest in people he's interviewed that I never would've been interested in before.   Matt Mira and Jonah Ray are his friends that jump in every now and then on the podcasts and are funny as hell.   I've been a fan since he interviewed Bill Burr and Reggie Watts and I went back and have listened to every episode. My favorite podcast was with Kurt Braunohler. Funniest episode ever."

I would assume this is the reason:  They have to make a tv-appropriate version, because if it wasn't appropriate for tv, they couldn't show it on tv. When deciding what to put online, they have two choices: 1. spend money and time to make a new edit, or 2. just put the video directly from tv online.  But that raises the question: why do they do it for Thursday shows at all? Well, I don't know, but it is a reason to go to cc.com (for the Thursday show) while not making Hulu or Comedy Central obsolete (shows from the other days aren't any different on cc.com)."
atmidnight,39o45z,zck,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:20:47 2015 UTC,"The Thursday shows get extended versions because they don't have a Friday show, which leaves the editors time to make two versions of the Thursday program for your enjoyment. I believe Chris Hardwick has answered this before."

But online is not regulated at all, so free game!"
atmidnight,39o45z,nerddtvg,2,Sat Jun 13 07:28:24 2015 UTC,"I think he means even online if you view the episodes that they played on TV they are censored despite not being broadcast through your TV at the time.    Does the FCC actually regulate premium services? I thought FCC governed only what is in the airwaves picked up by TV antenna. So like ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, and your syndicated stations/smaller stations like MeTV. I was under the understanding that since you must pay a subscription to get channels like CC, SPIKE, Oxygen, TNT, and the like they weren't subject to the FCC but had ""Standards and Practices"" that worked like a self regulating FCC type relationship. Basically that S & P are the ""safe guard"" to ensure the channel doesn't violate its self imposed rules.    That's what I always thought, I could be very very wrong."
atmidnight,39o45z,TheBRADLeyB,2,Sat Jun 13 13:51:15 2015 UTC,You're right.  It's pressure from sponsors that results in censorship on cable.

atmidnight,39o45z,TheBRADLeyB,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:23:24 2015 UTC,"Comedy Central is ""basic,"" not premium. HBO and Showtime are ""premium"" because they're commercial-free, and the ""premium"" you pay over your ""basic"" subscription reflects that. ABC, CBS etc. are ""broadcast.""  That said, basic cable and broadcast channels are subject to the same FCC rules. S&P departments are run by the networks (cable and broadcast alike) to make sure they don't run afoul of the FCC."

atmidnight,39o45z,RedJack99,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:54:32 2015 UTC,"They don't on Thursdays. The reason they don't change for Mon thru Wed is because of money. They're not paying for the hosting for all uncut episodes, as well as encouraging everyone to stop watching it on their TV and just waiting for the online version where they make less money on ads. So they upload the edited ones throughout the week until Thursday."

atmidnight,38j374,kaderick,2,Thu Jun 4 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"How many seats are there?  From what I've seen, it seems to be a much younger audience than most taping audiences.  Do they filter the applicants?  Was there a line, or did you request tickets?"
atmidnight,38j374,rhinny,3,Thu Jun 4 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"100+ seats, easily. There are quite a few more behind the seats you typically see on screen (like when the camera sweeps over the crowd at the beginning). The audience can be people of all ages, but it's probably more of a younger crowd for sure...Tickets are free on the Internet, the sooner you request them, the higher priority you are. None of the spots are guaranteed, but if you show up around one hour before the time, you'll likely get in. If you are a lower priority, they might have you wait to see how many seats are left after how ""VIPs"" show up. If you don't make it in, they give you highest priority to the next show. They only turned away like 5 people yesterday."
atmidnight,38j374,kaderick,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:49:26 2015 UTC,"Answering another part of your question, they sort of filter the audience. You're split into two lines when you show up. One is sort of nicer dressed (follow the instructions on the ticket: hip casual, solid dark colours, and do your hair nicely). Those people are seated in the rows of floor seats you see as the camera swoops around, but the rest of the people sit in a big bleacher, out of sight. It's a total audience class system - at the whim of the audience coordinator handling the lineup outside.  I'm not complaining. I was second row in the floor section, because I followed the styling instructions.  Edit: I saw a taping in late April this year."

There is a lot that doesn't make the show. Like the ""Geekpickuplines"" portion where Chris hates the hipster graphic, and went on FOREVER (15 minutes maybe?) with him ranting about nerd stereotypes and hilariously chewing out the graphics guy. Only a couple minutes made it, and I'm still amazed how well they cut it. Just sucks you guys missed it on the final edit, but it makes one feel somewhat special, too haha."

atmidnight,386vhn,luckoftehdraw,2,Tue Jun 2 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"it's not you, but it's not sexism either. it's a function of the how having fewer female guests than male. think about it: five nights a weeks, three guests a night. say there are three female guests that week, and none of them appear together. that's three chances to win (if they appear together that's actually one less chance) or lose (same). so, (1/3 chance of winning)x(3/5 chance of being on the show) = 1/15 of a chance that any given winner (or loser) during a week will be a woman.  Now, for a particular player, her individual chance of winning is 1/3. Makes sense. But her chances of losing are 2/3. Multiply that by the amount of appearances by women on the show (usually 3/5 in a week) and you get... 2/3.  Basically, it's confirmation bias. You don't notice as much when men are in the bottom, because they're there more often."

atmidnight,37o4zf,strawberrynight,1 point,Sat May 30 02:32:25 2015 UTC,"Yes they do. (As of the first 200 episodes, of all episodes where there was an elimination, 44% of the time it was contestant #2)  My theories behind it are that initially the girls were usually in the middle and ended up getting eliminated. Then later on a podcast, Chris said that someone pointed out that the girl was always in the middle, so they started to mix things up. After the show became pretty established, I guess they started to put the first-time/""weaker"" players in the middle, who tend to lose against experienced players. Other than that, red light on #2 just happens by chance."
atmidnight,37o4zf,TheBRADLeyB,3,Sat May 30 03:04:20 2015 UTC,I haven't looked at the stats but I've always figured they moved to a format where a producer or someone views the answers and puts it up in order of what the producer thinks will be the response. The FTWs aren't always funny so it'd be pretty shitty to have everyone die of laughter at your opponents response and then have crickets when Chris reads yours. You want the show on an incline of laughs rather than a mix mosh.  But I've never looked into it.
atmidnight,37o4zf,TheBRADLeyB,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:11:14 2015 UTC,in order of what the producer thinks will be the response   Good point! I hadn't considered this. /u/strawberrynight who commented has done the stats: 2nd place wins a majority of the time at 62%. But it doesn't really matter if the producers are ordering it that way intentionally.
atmidnight,37o4zf,mojolil,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, always want to end on a strong finish! But obviously it's not cement when the producers choose the order since sometimes the crowd finds the first funnier. Also the subjectivity of comedy makes it hard to always know what others will find funny.  It use to annoy me that the second answer won typically but I mean really the crowd does decide so it's not like I'm getting lied to or something."

Live challenges are the comedians' material done on the spot. But sometimes, they are just that good.   (I find that if you think less about the fact there's writers, the show is more fun to watch)"
atmidnight,36ncu0,strawberrynight,4,Wed May 20 17:53:40 2015 UTC,I believe this to be the correct answer.  Enough prep time to have a few quality jokes at the ready then riff for a while and they will edit it down from there.
atmidnight,36ncu0,PopWhatMagnitude,5,Thu May 21 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"It's been discussed before. The comedians write some jokes on their own beforehand depending on the segment but most of the jokes are improvised. The show also has writers that write the segments but do help the comedians if needed.   Here is an except from an interview with the #PointsMe winner Chris Cubas:   Splitsider: How collaborative was it, writing-wise? I know @midnight has a writing staff, but did you get to write most of your own jokes?  CC: Oh yeah, those were my jokes. They give you very little actual prep. When I got there, there was a walkthrough and literally it was for me stuff like learning where the camera is, that kind of thing. But the prep you get is very broad, like ""So the first thing that happens is the cold open, so we'll play a game and go 1-2-3 down the line and you don't have to buzz in"" ‚Äî not really telling you what the joke is, but just letting you know you don't have to buzz in ‚Äî ""and then the next one is Rapid Refresh ‚Äî you are gonna buzz in and we'll do three segments‚Ä¶"" There wasn't anything like ""Hey go write these jokes ahead of time."" But being someone who wasn't a regular contestant, one of the writers, Matt Mira, was sort of hand-holding me throughout the process."
atmidnight,36ncu0,teaminus,6,Wed May 20 18:05:25 2015 UTC,As long as its funny I will continue to enjoy the show scripted or not.
atmidnight,36ncu0,LordJunon,2,Wed May 20 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is funny regardless of prewriting. But you can see in some of the worse-edited episodes, the comedians looking down and reading off a list either right before or after their answer. Some hide it horribly. Other comedians are spot on, abd can improv everything. Rich Vos is a genius like that. His mind is quick, even if he says some stupid things."
atmidnight,36ncu0,cpltack,1 point,Wed May 20 20:05:41 2015 UTC,"Oh totally! I love the show either way, the unscripted banter and sidetracks are hilarious. I'm just kind of surprised they don't feel the need to write a little disclaimer at the end, like the way Hollywood Squares always said at the end that the celebrities were delivering canned material.   @Midnight could just say ""Some of the answers were pre-written prior to taping"" or something like that. Though I don't know the incentives to either do this or not. Maybe it was fallout from the Quiz Show scandals?"

atmidnight,36ncu0,IggysGlove,2,Sat May 23 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"""Most of the jokes are improvised""  That's the general consensus.  But it's extremely naive. . The majority of the jokes are pre-written."
atmidnight,36ncu0,not_thrilled,1 point,Thu May 21 10:50:34 2015 UTC,"Having read all the other answers, my two cents. Think back on the difference between improv actors and stand-up people, and the ""normal"" actors/slightly funny people. Just recently, look at Kathryn Hahn - very funny actress, but didn't fare well against UCB alum Brett Gelman. The people with improv experience, or stand-up experience trying to think on their feet against hecklers etc., tend to do better on @midnight."

The points may be shit points because they are awarded almost every time but the points decide the final two... or the final three if Chris decides the points are meaningless... or the final four if Rainn Wilson is on...

atmidnight,355cpf,megnesson,5,Thu May 7 17:47:20 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I actually think this was the hardest I even laughed on this show.

atmidnight,355cpf,Holovoid,3,Thu May 7 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"According to this article: http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/20/midnight-made-america-fall-in-love-panel-show  It sounds like its a bit of both. They get the topics ahead of time and have time to write out some jokes and pointers but are also encouraged to improv during filming.    The comedian contestants are informed of that night‚Äôs topics only a few hours before showtime. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really forced to write really quickly to make a quality show,‚Äù says Hari Kondabolu, a New York stand-up who made his second appearance on the show during the festival. ‚ÄúBefore the first time I did it, I was hearing [from friends who had been on: buzz in, and definitely prepare.

atmidnight,355cpf,KidLiquorous,-5,Sat May 16 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"This question is impossible to answer, because there are no contestant podiums. A podium is something you stand on. A lectern is something you stand behind."

atmidnight,35721w,BleedingCzar,2,Thu May 7 17:41:15 2015 UTC,The reason this format works for Jeopardy is because they tape a bunch of episodes at once and the contestant that wins does not need to keep coming in day after day. @midnight couldn't use this format because then they wouldn't be able to stay up to date with daily events.
atmidnight,35721w,fatmagellan,1 point,Wed May 13 01:31:26 2015 UTC,"I like smarty-pants quizzes like QI and Jeopardy! a lot, but it's really hard to find comedy in the US that features good word play. I really like the current format, although I would like to see them experiment with more new games. I would like some questions with a bit more meat to them, rather than just providing a stimulus to make jokes off of.   I think it would be fun to be able to view an extended edition with fewer cuts on the website. Maybe if a game is going particularly well, they could just edit in a buzzer for the aired version but actually continue letting them play for a few extra minutes while recording."

It's a vehicle for funny people to say punny things and riff off of each other.   That's why Chris lets all three contestants go to the final round so often, for example.

atmidnight,32tgw8,zackb1991,6,Thu Apr 16 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"This problem is similar to when any show host gives their thoughts on something their guest has created (or the guests themselves). When Letterman has someone on, Nerdist guests, and so on.  The way it's handled is that it's always positive in some angle. Everything is couched in positivity. If Hardwick really didn't like a show but had to have an actor from it on, he'd find something he liked about it to focus on, or simply not share the negatives he feels.  This isn't unique to television, of course, but the stakes are higher. We've all been in that social situation where we withhold bad thoughts or fixate on one particular thing that can be construed as positive. Even Jonah Ray has a joke about that:   What did you think of the band last night?  ...Oh, they're... such good guys. Great guys, you know?   Hardwick can lose that if it ever becomes the norm that people stay on for the final round. That's why it has to stay a special bonus positive thing for when he's really into keeping the person on. Just like it could become eyeroll-inducing if every Nerdist guest were the Greatest Ever.  As long as being red-lit doesn't ever feel like actual rejection, it'll be okay."

I think a lot of this may be due to the rising success of the show. Whenever something is new and starting out you tend to not put a lot of weight on the exposure until the show takes off because many new things don't always go places. After the show became established the 'losers' probably realize that they are losing very valuable exposure time by not proceeding to the final round vs. the people in the beginning who were a part of a fun new show that was still growing.  I do feel that Chris does a good job pushing all three people through to the final round when they have truly all put on a good show and put forth a good effort throughout."
atmidnight,32tgw8,OwlEyes312,2,Sat Apr 18 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"I always look at the show like it's pro wrestling.  The answers are pre-written for the contestants.  I assume the decision to keep someone is based on whether the writers have three really good answers, or if the contestants are doing some sort of joint promo for something.

I don't think Chris has heard all the jokes beforehand, and even if he has, his decision to award points could be based on the delivery as well as the content; it just seems to me like there's some sincere surprise when the final point tallies are announced...

atmidnight,32mimj,nocturnalvoice,5,Tue Apr 14 23:55:09 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I worked in a building the size of a Walmart, but with cubicles instead of shelves, and it was mostly pretty quiet as everyone was doing work, often with headphones.  But we all had chats going constantly, mostly work related.    Well, one of my chats had forty or fifty people going in it, and work being slow, we ended up playing around and retitling movies as if they were zombie movies (think Zombify a Movie).  We probably listed about twenty or thirty really terrible adaptations, like Deadtanic, Bill and Ted's Zombie Adventure, etc. etc. but what produced a random laugh across a series of scattered cubicles was a completely unchanged title:  ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""."
