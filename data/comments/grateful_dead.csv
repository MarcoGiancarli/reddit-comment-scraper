grateful_dead,3dzr9t,Tom_Anks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:05 2015 UTC,When did the first remix take place? Is there any way to find out if my vinyl copy is the original?
grateful_dead,3dzr9t,Tom_Anks,3,Tue Jul 21 09:03:48 2015 UTC,"the remix happened in 1971, and the original features an a capella ending of Doin' That Rag rather than the usual fade in the 1971 mix. There are also some bagpipe effects during St. Stephen, some effects during What's Become of The Baby, and there is also a vocal choir on Mountains of The Moon. Dupree's Diamond Blues has a radically different mix. The China Cat Sunflower original mix is really chaotic.  During the lead-in to Cosmic Charlie someone tells the band to ""make it loud"" to which Jerry responds ""get f***ed"". St. Stephen has more screaming, too. The original mix of the album is a far superior record in my opinion. Even the Rhino vinyl and cd re-release is the 1971 remix. The bonus cuts are studio jams from August 1968.    Briefly, here are but some of the differences I’ve noticed (all as compared to the remix, times are approximate);    St Stephen - 1st mix 4:32 rmx 4:25 Opening chords start almost as a whisper with guitar leading, around 17 seconds volume increases a bit, then EXPLODES with opening vocals. Mix much crisper with discreet drums and guitars, Weir high vocal louder. A loud scream into 1st little lead break. Rhythm lick louder on “lower down, lower down”. A second Jerry vocal arrives during “across the morning sky” and crisp high ring bell joins the melody. Vocal modulates and bells increase and echo until “call it your own”. Back to crisp mix. Handclaps on last verse. More screams on outtro jam and piano flurry up until band stops to dead end (no fade out). Dupree’s Diamond Blues - 1st mix 3:46 rmx 3:40 Crisper acoustic guitar, very discreet mix, Jerry’s vocal phasing, the bass drum is booming on the bottom. On “Well you know son…” discreet banjo and bells/glockenspiel, Jerry’s vocal multiplies. “Baby, Baby..” an overlayed vocal. Vocals alternately phase, in and out of echo, multiply…several vocals “dah dah dah” to the dead end. A moment’s silence, then a rumble and what sounds like a plastic cup loudly dropping.    Rosemary - 1st mix 2:12 rmx 2:02 Discreet dry instruments. Jerry’s vocal being very heavily phased and modulated, almost disappearing at times, moving back and forth between the speakers. Comes to a finish with a pretty acoustic guitar chord.    Doing That Rag - 1st mix 5:20 rmx 5:15 Dry discreet mix, drum very prominent in intro. Vocal phased but soon goes dry. On the first “Doing that rag” break, Weir in background going “yoohoo, yoohoo”. About 1:50-2:00 there’s another drum in background. “Don’t neglect..” dry slide is beginning to echo, some vocal phasing “..as the aces are crawling down your sleeve”. About 4:30 other voices start singing wide swatches and echoing behind “all fall down, all fall under” with organ, band grinds to a halt, guitar noodles and bass grunts chords, some voice doing low yodel-thing. Ends a capella “Everwhere I go, the people..” sounds like the vocalists are back in an echo room and they slowly approach the mic until they’re right on top of it, no echo on “..doing that RAG-uh”.    Mountains Of The Moon - 1st mix 4:18 rmx 4:15 This is trippy and beautiful.. Very brief start, pause, restart. Crisp guitar and harpsichord really meshing..Jerry’s lightly phased vocal both in foreground and quietly in background. Faint echoing female background vocals already noticeable by :35, providing color with constantly changing oohs, aahs, etc, ..very angelic. A second batch arrive 2:40. Double acoustic guitars, Jerry singing “dah dah dah’s” and echoing choir goes higher and louder and fades to Jerry’s dry last “dah dah’s”.    China Cat Sunflower - 1st mix 4:20 rmx 3:40 Dry drum ratatat and guitar noises, becomes china-lick and song..Jerry vocal phased and multiplies. Multiple background vocal “la-la-la’s”. 1:00 Tim piano licks start appearing and plays constant fills during next verse as vocal starts phasing and modulating. Nice organ fills at 2:05 and 2:20, last verse vocal very phased almost disappears at beginning. Last words ..”Queen of Chinee..”followed by buried “chuey” repeated at least a couple times on the beat. Outtro jam doesn’t fade; just keeps going like a Viola Lee type of thing with “China Cat Sunflower” vocals until band grinds to halt, followed by loose vocals, organ and guitar licks.    What’s Become Of The Baby - 1st mix 8:34 rmx 8:30 a muffled bump sound separates the tracks, like a splice or switch being thrown (same at end BTW). Same basic vocal track, but VERY different treatment. (Was gonna be another minuet, but Hendrix was expected by, so they went crazy instead). Hard to describe, but whereas remix is mostly echo, this 1st mix starts dry with TONS of constantly changing phasing and modulation, and LOTS of little organ and guitar noises. Very Pranksterish!    Cosmic Charlie - 1st mix 5:46 rmx 5:45 Starts with “Make it Loud!” and a quiet echoed voice answering something as the sound builds. Really explosive mix, effects such as phase and echo on instruments and vocals (sometimes stereo placement) seem to slowly change and ebb at times. And then it’s gone.     As Jerry explained in an early 70’s Rolling Stone review, Aoxomoxoa had been an attempt to put out little bite-size, possibly radio-friendly, self-contained songs/trips. They started with 8 tracks (I presume the St Stephen w/bagpipes outtake is one of these), but abandoned those takes when 16 tracks became available. ."

grateful_dead,3dqpim,abud1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"That very well might have been me. This show is, hands down, one of the Dead's best showings of their psychedelic power. This is the strongest representation of Clementine; the band seemed so cohesive, in contrast to the other dozen-or-so Clementines played the year prior. Phil absolutely kills it, and parts of it are reminiscent of the ""cosmic silence"" that truly came to fruition in Dark Star the following year. I'm probably really overanalyzing it, but this concert is a prime example of the Dead laying the foundation for some of their strongest psychedelic shows that would come about in the weeks and months following."

grateful_dead,3do51o,JamBandLinkerBot,2,Sat Jul 18 09:28:33 2015 UTC,"I am adding this post to my myth and mystery of past Dead shows.  I have often wondered if Dead shows I now consider to be the best ever were perceived at the time. The band broke new ground regularly, so I am guessing that in 74 there were a lot of aficionados who looked back and thought 1972 was the peak.   My first show was in 1979, in Carbondale Il.  Sound was rough.  I listened to a crowd source tape of the show recently and thought it sounded better than being there, I was too close to the stage I think.   I went to a couple in 1980, but it wasn't until 1982 that I became a regular.  Every show I went to I would hear at least one core fan say shows one year, ten years, etc ago were so much better.  I can't help but wonder if there were people at the Veneta Oregon show, my and many others choice for best ever, in 1972 saying this sucks, I remember when.    1974 was a special year, Wall of Sound and all, and my favorite show of the year, and top 10 of all time, is 8/6/74 at Roosevelt University.  It was great reading these notes, seeing that even then he knew something special was happening on the best nights of the tour."
grateful_dead,3do51o,JamBandLinkerBot,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:00 2015 UTC,"I've always had similar thoughts. Glorifying the past seems to be an easy train of thought for everyone, in regards to everything in life. And our perceptions are always changing as well, which makes things even more complicated. There was a time where i use to right off the early 80s and thought it all sounded like shit. Now, it is a favorite period of mine (mainly for JGB shows, catfish john and Limbo are so dark during this time). I use to think the mid 90s were all shit too, but ive come to find recently that i enjoy the sound of songs like Stella or Wharf Rat when JG sounds dried up and withered. It adds to the storytelling element of the songs. Im sure there were plenty of fans that thought things got to clean and structured after 69 or so, or the band was over when Pig died.  Whats interesting is in his notes about 73, Dick talks positively about the William and Mary shows, yet in an article about which quotes a drunken Dick, he says that September 73 is the worst excuse for music he has ever heard.  I use to love 79, but at the moment, i think fall 79 is overrated, and 80 sounds so much better. I can't even get my own opinion about shows straight....  At this point its all myths, and i don't know what to think. I know all my opinions of shows will probably be different in a week from now anyways.  As a side not though, i was watching the footage the other night of Roosevelt, two years later in 76. Veneta will always reign supreme. Its not my top show at the moment (11/08/70 is), but i always hold it in high regard"

They also helped out in the design of the Wall of Sound.  Jack Cassidy and Phil Lesh's Guild Starfire(Used mostly in 72-74) were their first guinea pigs and also the first instruments ever to have active electronics (Gives you way more control of the sound of your instrument). Phil's modded bass has some pretty unique traits, like a quad pickup, that has inspired many bass playing Deadheads enough to make similarly modded Starfire basses. Such as:  1  2  3  4  For another example of the awesomeness of the Godfather bass, check out Phil's solo between Dark Star and Eyes of the world. Listen with headphones! 2-15-73"

Not to put you on a pedestal, but i eventually conceived the notion of ""this guy know what he's talking about"" in regards to you. When you started this sub as an offshoot of the other one, you brought (in my opinion) all the  best contributors with you. I think that speaks volumes. While the other sub has its own great discussions, and i am not trying to downplay anyone over there, this one seems to dive a little deeper. I feel this place is more about the music.

But increasingly, I don't know how I can square most of what I stand for IRL with frequent participation on a platform that actively facilitates the atrocious bullshit you can apparently find on here.

It's certainly true that the line between hate speech and protected free expression of an opinion (even an unpopular one) is pretty bright. Deciding not to participate and thereby help enable a platform that actively refuses to address communities specifically designed to encourage hate speech against black people and others is eminently reasonable, imo. I'm not saying that any specific person's behavior should necessarily be made illegal in itself or something, but at least up here in Canada the concept of hate speech is well-defined, and the criminal prohibition on hate speech has a clear constitutional justification. But regardless of whether it's legal, community guidelines are not a bad thing and no one should feel that they can remain in an ethically neutral position by just ignoring what's going on and allowing the status quo here to flourish. You can't be neutral on a moving train.  What I'm torn about is how much interesting stuff I've learned and been able to share on here for such a long time, a routine which regularly brightens up what would otherwise be another boring workday. Some great people and great content do exist on here still, so while it might be rather selfish I'm actually torn."

The event was organised by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for relief of the ongoing Ethiopian famine. Billed as the ""global jukebox"", the event was held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London, England, United Kingdom (attended by 72,000 people) and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States (attended by about 100,000 people).  On the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative happened in other countries, such as Australia and Germany. It was one of the largest-scale satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time: an estimated global audience of 1.9 billion, across 150 nations, watched the live broadcast.

grateful_dead,3cu9pm,arghdos,5,Sat Jul 11 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"OK so ideally you could see a range of shows at once and check the ones you were at. Having the ""I was there"" button only on the show page (which is how existing sites do it) is annoying because if you went to a lot of shows you have to open each one.  Once you can view your own stats the next most interesting thing would be to see them in comparison with the Deadbase style statistical norms. Is it weird that it took you 14 shows to catch a Terrapin? Did you realize that the TLEO you caught was one of just 4 that year?   http://www.deadstats.com/ is gathering all the right data I think but they're not letting you view it or manipulate it in granular ways.

grateful_dead,3cfmnu,arghdos,5,Tue Jul 7 15:18:32 2015 UTC,"Part 2 Part 3    Part one is centrally based on Live / Dead, with a few tracks from the 28th thrown in, as well as the excellent Mountains of the Moon from the 22nd @ the Dream Bowl    Part two is more of a mid-summer jam, heavy on the acoustic / country songs often played in that period, with quite a bit of the Ark run mixed in for good measure.  It also features a few of the best tracks from 03/01 (TOO >  New Potato, and The Eleven)    Part three is alluding towards the transition to '70, and thus features shows from Nov/Dec.  There's quite a bit from 12/28, one of my favorites from the New Years run, and the rest are from 11/02 & 11/08.

grateful_dead,3c8dzq,bitter_twin_farmer,3,Mon Jul 6 22:25:06 2015 UTC,That went on for too long. Last show ever and still needed a long drums section?    Judging by body language it seems like they don't really like Mickey.
grateful_dead,3c8dzq,Ferniff,5,Mon Jul 6 10:39:13 2015 UTC,"There is definitely some tensions between the drummers and the rest of the band (specifically Phil).  Billy is pretty explicit in his book and Mickey is quoted as saying ""Phil must have gotten the liver of a jerk"", so clearly they are not on the best terms.  Its also interesting the Mickey played with mallets and bundles the whole show and had more of a percussion rig than a second kit.  On the flip side mickey sat in during all of the spaces playing beam and synthy stuff.  Maybe mickey is just more into spacey weird sounds than straight drums at this point.  Also, the broadcast of the beam parts of the show is not even close to the way they feel in person in the stadium. They are so deep and massive that the whole stadium vibrates like a giant speaker cone.  Really really intense stuff at the venue."
grateful_dead,3c8dzq,bobbysmith007,4,Mon Jul 6 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting, What does he say, what happened? I honestly probably won't read his book, since Phil's my favorite.    And I guess the webcast can't do it justice but it still went on for too long. Did the fans really like the drums part of the show, even back in the day?"
grateful_dead,3c8dzq,Ferniff,5,Mon Jul 6 14:59:24 2015 UTC,"He actually pulls back from talking about what directly happened that broke up the Dead 09, leaving it at he has nice conversations with everyone but Phil.  He did a good job of not attacking anyone in particular, but all descriptions just point at not having that common ground that makes them want to work together.  Reading between the lines and from some other shit in the scene, Phil is very against hard drug use in his bands but obviously cant enforce that in the dead, and even if they are sober, trying to assert that control is upsetting in that environment.  Additionally Jill, Phil's wife is a bit of a hard ass and asserts more control than the rest of the band feels she should (including rumors of controlling setlists and the like).  On the other hand, Phil's bands consistently sell out larger shows, for higher ticket prices, with more interesting musicians, than the other members individual bands and you cannot say its unrelated to management.  Fundamentally I think its just 50 years of too many big opinions in one room and without the center there is nothing to overcome that part.  I feel like drums and space has always been a divisive moment.  Its definitely something MUCH more powerful in person than on recording.  Even so some people like the dead for their songs and some for their willingness to go into deep space.  I will say that I have not been bored during drums and space at  any of the 4 dead shows I got to attend, but did hear parts of the crowd kvetching and other parts of the crowd extolling the virtues of drums and space."

On the fourth though, my buddy is purchasing the stream and we will watch it live from his house and host a big BBQ that day. Then we will watch all the fireworks from the park across the street, they are the best fireworks in the city for the fourth. After SC, I am really excited to see what Chicago has to offer musically. Trey and Jeff really nailed it, in my opinion, Sunday night and seemed so much more comfortable and at home playing. I was tearing up. At Levis when the boys played Brokedown, so I am also excited to see what kind of soul filled church like moments they will cook up knowing these are the last shows.

Watched the soundcheck from the Ferris wheel in the amusement park next door. People were breaking into the park over the fence even though there was free admission, which is classic Deadhead behavior for sure."
grateful_dead,3bmyoi,MrCompletely,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:34:20 2015 UTC,"Ha, was that Canada's Wonderland or something outside of Toronto? Pretty sure I've been to that amusement park.  I love hearing GD lore from that part of the world since I've spent lots of time around the music scene there. From what I can gather the Seneca College show in 77 is what sparked the interest in the Dead that grew around there through the 80s. Even though they played a week long residency in 69 and then Festival Express in 70, Toronto didn't become an epicenter til later I guess. Still some very fun Dead (and JGB) tributes happen around there regularly and I've met lots of old crazy heads around there"
grateful_dead,3bmyoi,wilbard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"Canada's Wonderland, yep, the ampitheater is on the groups of the park. There's an entrance just for the ampitheater, but you could just walk into the park (maybe you had to show your concert ticket?) which made the people breaking in super funny  I only crossed the border for shows twice - this one and the two Hamilton shows on Spring '90. Both GREAT times. Cops and locals all very chill.   Show is above average for '87, I disagree that it's one of the best of the year as some say"

grateful_dead,3b7oig,MrCompletely,7,Fri Jun 26 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"I'd describe my attitude as basically ""curious"", with a little more excitement than I anticipated. This is the sort of comment that always attracts downvotes, but one of the things I'm most excited about is to see how Trey handles this. And also how the group interaction develops over the 5 nights.  I doubt our 2-month old will let us take in the whole deal live, so we're still contemplating how to navigate the streaming situation."
grateful_dead,3b7oig,wilbard,6,Fri Jun 26 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I'm mostly just curious, but have definitely gotten swept up in the hype a little bit and am getting kinda excited. I don't expect to have my mind blown by any really epic jams, but the potential is definitely there for a few pretty special moments- especially for the fans (imagine the whole crowd singing that ""la da da da da"" chorus at the end of Ripple. That should happen. In fact- Ripple>Brokedown>WBYGN encore on the 5th. Boom.). And the band seems aware that they have an opportunity here and appear to be taking this seriously and professionally, so I expect some tight performances of well crafted setlists that give the people what they want. Should be fun! That said, I don't think any of my friends have any interest, and my girlfriend has already banished me to what she is calling the ""Dead Cave"" (my office), so I'm likely flying solo. Who will hear me correctly call the tunes?!  Anyway, it has been quite a year of renewed interest and activity for the GD and it is all coming to a head now. Seems like lots of people everywhere are thinking about the band and their history and I think it's great that everybody gets one last chance to experience it. Enjoy it!"

grateful_dead,3b7oig,smckenzie23,3,Sat Jun 27 00:03:46 2015 UTC,"For sure, but those shows were a bit less high-profile, and Trey didn't spend months before them studying Garcia's playing style and influences and practicing with Bob & Phil, etc., as he claims to have been doing for this. By his own account, we'll very likely see Trey doing some things we haven't seen him do before, and to me that's musically the most exciting prospect of this GD50 thing."
grateful_dead,3b7oig,wilbard,3,Sat Jun 27 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"This. Everything else is fairly predictable.   Still super excited - woke up at 4:30 this morning and couldn't get back to sleep. After a 10 mile run, I'm going to need a nap this afternoon. It's going to run late on the east coast."

grateful_dead,3b7oig,smckenzie23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:44:26 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but still not very likely imo. Phish has struggled to avoid that sort of association and it's possible this GD50 thing will make them even more wary of such a move. But who knows... they love the unexpected and anything's possible. An Alabama Getaway encore at the Tuscaloosa show on 08-02 would be pretty wild."
grateful_dead,3b7oig,wilbard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"I think less wary. During most of their career they were trying to strike out on their own and not be compared to the Dead too much. But this happened. It is a part of history. I was standing 6 people from stage in 98 when they did Terrapin Station. Amazing, but I knew it was a one-off at the time. Now I'm pretty sure they will pay tribute. Mike is a huge head. Trey has now been living and breathing it. It's gonna happen."

I guess it wouldn't surprise me if they did a few one-off GD tributes, but it would certainly surprise me if they incorporated any Dead tunes as ""core songs"". I don't think they'd want to put up with the comparisons of ""whose was better"", etc. But who knows, they've surprised me before."

grateful_dead,3b7oig,le1278,2,Sun Jun 28 17:22:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought he stepped out more as it developed, and the setlist was well-designed for that, too.

grateful_dead,3b43f1,tenjed,2,Thu Jun 25 20:21:47 2015 UTC,they're some king of straight up ripoff bootleg crap  both have songs on them not played the years they're supposedly from and are obviously mismatched setlists...  might have some good tunes on em though!
grateful_dead,3b43f1,MrCompletely,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:43:50 2015 UTC,The band is really on fire on some of the songs - one of the best Good Lovin's I've heard. But the vocals sound weird - like the band is sucking on helium. The music sounds great but the vocals are definitely off.
grateful_dead,3b43f1,drunkangel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess the recordings are legal to sell for some reason, maybe they're in the public domain for some reason, maybe a loophole somewhere. If you look at what else the label has released, it's everything from Willie Nelson to Duke Ellington, lots of old stuff, and all the artwork has the same kind of generic boring style. Also, meaningless phrases like ""collector's edition"" and ""platinum series"" makes it seem like quality stuff, when it probably isn't. If I'm correct about the recordings being in the public domain, or for whatever reason legal to sell, it's probably an easy way to make some money by selling something that costs almost nothing to produce. Kinda like the ""50 horror/scifi/western movies"" dvd boxes you can buy on amazon for $10.   Also: the speed / pitch seems to be way off on both the Grateful Dead shows."

Continuing the tradition of providing the most complete collection of data regarding Grateful Dead concerts, both from a statistical perspective and more personal experiential recollections, DeadBase 50 is a mixed bag of a reference book (992 pages worth!).  In response to the countless requests to reprint the last complete edition, this anniversary edition contains a reprint of DeadBase XI plus updates to the master list (DeadBase) of Grateful Dead shows, updates to GarciaBase and WeirBase, and new sections for NedBase, Phil Lesh and Friends, The Dead, and Furthur. Along with new reviews, analysis and a brand new discography, this book also includes a number of new photos from Jay Blakesberg, Herb Greene, Bob Minkin, Rosie McGee, Susana Millman and others.

Here are some I love, one from each of the big DS and I'll let my pal the jambandlinkerbot fill in the blanks  10.13.68 one of the first really wild ones   11.2.69 breaking the Live/Dead template and moving into ""thematic jam"" territory  9.19.70 a perfect gem  there aren't many from '71 but most of them are actually pretty creative. 10.24.71 is a lesser known one I like  1972 is THE year for Dark Stars with over 30 diverse versions, most of them circulating in good SBD! It's really hard to go wrong. I will somewhat randomly pick 8.24.72 to recommend, it is really excellent  Some pretty great ones in '73 too of course. Sprawling and jazzy. Check out 10.25.73 for sure if you have not heard it. 12.6.73 is my all time favorite, it was officially released on a RT bonus disk.  They were apparently a little burned out on it in '74, there are few versions. I think 7.25.74 is the only one that hasn't been released in some form!  The next great one is 1.10.79, I will link to a specific source because they are all AUDs and I think this recently circulated source is the best I've heard yet https://archive.org/details/gd1979-01-10.132236.aud.fob.nak.cm-300.gatto-wise.flac16 - if you haven't heard this show it is great and the Dark Star is legit weird and intense. An under the radar favorite.   there are some other ones in between but the next great unreleased (until the box set drops!!!) Dark Star is 10.26.89, pretty much the weirdest single thing they did post 1975  I don't think there's a truly great unreleased one from '90, but 12.12.90 is fun and NYE has some pop  The last one I'll link is the lovely Greensboro 4.1.91 Dark Star with Bruce....gorgeous   have fun!!!!"

grateful_dead,3ah0ya,JamBandLinkerBot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:45:30 2015 UTC,"Agree that '72 is the best year for Dark Star, with consistently excellent versions all year. Europe, the August run, and the September east coast shows are especially strong. And I like that BCT one from 8/24, but will also mention 8/21/72 from the same run, as it used to be my go-to back in the day. Vicious double tiger towards the end where Jerry tries to start Morning Dew but Phil wants to stay in crazy town and basically imposes his will. Worth a listen.  Also agree on 12/6/73. Very deep meditative version with some super cool Phil drones. Anybody who likes the more cerebral versions like 11/11 will want to check it out.  I also like those late '71 versions where you get to hear new addition Keith exploring the space and adding new colors to what had been a fairly monochromatic jam for the previous couple of years. Other Ones from this era are also very interesting and often veer into more subtle Dark Star-esqe territory.   That said, Live Dead is still my most sacred Dark Star. Have just heard it so many times that the whole thing is totally etched in my brain and I have a hard time not comparing any other versions from the era to it. Truly classic Good Old Grateful Dead."

grateful_dead,3ah0ya,Zdua7,2,Sat Jun 20 06:06:31 2015 UTC,they loved that aggressive off the deep end stuff in '72 dark stars. classic
grateful_dead,3ah0ya,verno329,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:44:03 2015 UTC,That's why that era is my favorite for DS. Invariably you forget you're listening and are just transported into the mist of whatever space they're jamming into. I also like the longer TOO from this era where they go into a proto drums>space kinda thing.

grateful_dead,3ah0ya,wilbard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:15:03 2015 UTC,that one's my favorite too! the last few minutes have some of my favorite jamming ever
grateful_dead,3ah0ya,JamBandLinkerBot,2,Sat Jun 20 20:25:53 2015 UTC,"I know it may sound cliche/overstated, but if i were to answer that right now it would be the infamous 2/13/70 one. dark star>TOO>Lovelight is a great 90 minutes of music where i can't help but get a little lost in it. I think it's so well known because it is that good, why else would it be included on the dick's picks for the following night!? Plus it has a Feelin' Groovy jam, so you got to love that.  also, i have yet to find a truly great recording of it, but the equally famous 2/14/70 DS>spanish jam>lovelight is great where they were joined on stage by members of the allman bros, love, and fleetwood mac. although who was on stage during what time is still debated. At one point though, i believe Phil just stopped playing during the jam to stop and listen to what was going on because it was so magnificent. (atleast i think it was this dark star. im almost positive it is.)  The answer to that question is always changing though, and depends on what songs come before/after it. for example 5/14/74 DS is always a favorite, especially how it comes out in to China Doll. i'm still kicking myself in the butt for not picking up that Dave's pick.  EDIT: Sorry, i should have read your whole post first and not just the title to see you wanted less obvious ones. my favorite, less obvious one (though theres a good chance you may still know it) is 6/30/73, right before Eyes"

grateful_dead,3aed9s,shtuffit,3,Fri Jun 19 13:05:02 2015 UTC,Looks pretty decent. However tracks dont switch if the app is backgrounded. Are you just rendering the archive.org page inside your own app with your own custom icon for each show? It would be great if you could increase the font size so i can read it while my phone or tablet is mounted on my dash. Adding some show notes from setlist.com or similar would be a great feature too.  Have you used phishtracks.com or phish.in? These are Web pages but give a decent phone interface.  Overall a good start since there isnt another app like this that i know of. Let meknow if you need help testing changes. I have access to a few android devices.

grateful_dead,3a96fs,Ferniff,3,Fri Jun 19 16:02:21 2015 UTC,"My all time favorite GD book is Conversations With the Dead by David Gans, it's all interviews.  Similarly the long interview-based book Signpost to A New Space is the best single look inside Garcia's head in his relative youth.  The big McNally book Long Strange Trip is dry and at times quite boring to me but has a great deal of detail on the 1966-70 era. The seventies not so much, and McNally isn't actually any good at writing about the music itself.  The new book So Many Roads is fairly interesting with a different perspective."
grateful_dead,3a96fs,MrCompletely,3,Thu Jun 18 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely second Conversations with the Dead. In general, hearing about the music straight from the horses' mouths is far more interesting to me than a narrative constructed after the fact by someone else, and I go back to that one often. Phil's book is interesting, too."

It's a train wreck where there is no winner...but trashing anyone without any real facts is a waste of energy. I feel bad for all involved. Everything I've read seems to lead to the same conclusion.....both camps made pretty far out claims to the public and to each other. When I first saw this event I thought it sounded like fun, but way overpriced. And spending $500 bucks on tickets that said trust us (I'm from jersey too) seemed nuts. One thing that struck me as unprankster like was Zane pulling out because of no contract. Isn't the idea behind being a prankster all about freedom and living in the moment? Just an observation.....and normal hinting that the warlocks were gonna show without even having a venue was just a red flag that everything was pretty much bs. I feel bad for all the folks in the middle and I hope they get there money back or have a great camping experience...whatever they were looking for when they signed up.

There's an obvious connection between this song and Deal - maybe Deal is the same fellow early on when things are going well, or Deal is someone else at the table with him...  Another triad of songs I consider related, in my imagination anyway, is Peggy-O, Jack-a-roe and Terrapin. The narrator of Peggy-O is the Soldier in Terrapin, and he is too ""smart"" for love (strategy is his strength...) because of what happened to his Captain. The sailor is obviously from Jackaroe though the narratives don't line up as neatly because he gets a happy ending in that song."

What my brain has made a small correlation with before is linking Jack-a-roe and ship of fools. but i like the link between those three, i think the Peggy-o and Terrapin one totally makes sense.

grateful_dead,39c488,Ferniff,6,Wed Jun 10 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"One of my absolute favorite shows. Definitely in my top 10. This eyes, especially, encapsulates that beautiful summer '73 sound.  edit: If you've never listened to it, it's a longer show at three sets. It has a bouncy TLEO, typical of pre-hiatus, and it's wonderful. The Bird Song, Eyes, Playing, Dark Star, and NFA->GDTRFB->NFA are fantastic summer 73 jams. The Eyes, especially, is incredibly patient, and showcases not only Keith at his best, but Phil doing some awfully evil Quadrophonic bass fun, and it really is very present in the recording. He'll be on your right, on your left, above you, right in your face, fade to the back... it's wonderful. Bobby is high in the mix, which works out so well, since you can hear his complex rhythm work for once.   I can't sing enough praises for this show. People show me fall 73, or that Kezar Stadium show, but every time I always come back to this absolutely soaked afternoon/evening at RFK. Three sets, Donna is on fire, Keith is salt and pepper, Jerry is homemade spaghetti sauce, Billy is on top of things with the utensils, Phil is a wonderful batch of home-made noodles, and Bobby brings it all together with the Parmesan. How else can you really describe a Dead show, other than with ridiculous metaphors?  Apparently there are guests in Set 3, but I honestly can't tell. Maybe it's because by the time I make it to Set 3 I'm way too fucking hyped from Set 2? I don't know. Listen to this one, guys. It's gold."

Like /u/rotationation, it's consistently in my rotation of top shows. My problem is '73 is so great that every show I listen to becomes my favorite show ever, until I get a chance to listen to the next one. But this is up there, and definitely a special show."

grateful_dead,39bih5,MrCompletely,7,Wed Jun 10 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"Seems reasonable, to me, at least.  I dunno. I've had to find third-party tickets and trust strangers on the internet to get seats. I'd be happy with anything.   This whole shebang has left a sour taste in my mouth. I've seen so much anger and vitriol over what should be a celebration. But, so it goes?"
grateful_dead,39bih5,Rotationation,8,Wed Jun 10 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the really outraged anger is from a small minority who are just super fucking loud online. Most people who were impacted by the ticket foolishness are somewhere between mildly exasperated and annoyed with the whole thing, not seething with fury like the few loud mouths.   I think honestly most people are correctly focusing on turning the end result into a positive experience. Sure it's been kind of a shitshow up to now, but why let it ruin your good time?   I think the band will be hitting the stage with totally positive intent and most of the crowd will be right there with them. Who wants to be in the 5% sitting out there stewing about how they didn't get the tickets they wanted?"
grateful_dead,39bih5,MistyMountainHop,2,Wed Jun 10 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't get tickets, I didn't want them, just to be clear on that.  See, I think your response is reasonable. I'm talking about the fire-breathing rage that was flying around for awhile. Read what I said again. A lot of people are frustrated, annoyed, bummed, etc. That's all reasonable reactions to disappointment, and there have been fuckups for sure. I just think the really angry people are mostly pretty ignorant about how things actually work.  The thing about season ticket holders, no offense brother, but that's something that's been made really clear in online discussions about this, and everyone should understand by now. It's not up to the promoter. That kind of PSL deal exists at every major sporting venue these days, which means every venue big enough to host this event. It's just how things work now and legally there was no way around it.  Of course it's lame to see the scalping. But they can't break that contract, and one reason they did mailorder (which turned out to be overwhelmed, but that's a different topic) was to try to keep tix out of the hands of scalpers and their ticketmaster bot swarms."
grateful_dead,39bih5,Billy_Ray_Valentine,3,Thu Jun 11 12:25:22 2015 UTC,"My understanding from actual lawyer friends is that the PSL contract thing it's impossible to break. And those club level season ticket holders aren't actually a big number in the overall scheme. Most of the scalping is straight up typical ticketmaster/stubhub bullshit, which is why they went with their own online sales (basically phish ticketing system) for Santa Clara.  But I totally agree there were fuckups. Especially the logistics of mailorder. That was lame and it impacted a lot of people.  And yeah. I understand the melancholy overall vibe and how the clusterfuck has added to it. Peace, brother."
grateful_dead,39bih5,metapatterns,2,Thu Jun 11 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"That's not the choice of the promoters, that is required by the venue."
grateful_dead,39a3k0,ScatterOfLight,3,Wed Jun 10 10:04:32 2015 UTC,"Good on Dean to bring this to light in a classy way. Good on the promoters for making it right.  Emotions are really high and many people are taking this event very personally.  It is important that the final chapter of this extraordinary story will be executed to the best of everyone's ability.  It's not just Shapiro and the band, either. We as fans need to represent ourselves in the best light and all read Bill Walton's words in the Washington Post and bring joy and love and support all wrapped in a positive vibe. It is our duty to leave Santa Clara and Chicago a better place than before we were there.   Thankfully, i believe all of this will manifest itself and once you get behind the wheel for the roadtrip, step foot on the lot, and when the band takes the stage, all of this will wash away the rest will be pure gravy.  Love and light and abundance to all!"

Back when I posted that question I spent quote a bit of time listening to Warfield and Radio City acoustic sets on archive. At the time I thought I figured out which show it was (one of the Warfields) but the band argument was not on any of the archive recordings that I listened to.   I know I have the cassette somewhere, but if I recall correctly it's filler so finding it will be a Herculean task, but I intend to do it.   My recollection of this argument is after the finish of a Bobby tune, they all start arguing. Someone (I think it's Mickey) is carrying on repeating over and over ""you made ME fuck up"" (emphasis on the 'me') and finally Jerry says in sort of a comical tone ""Jeez Bob nobody's blaming you for fucking up"", to which Mickey screams ""I am!"""

As for the argument, I'm fairly certain it was a 1980 Radio City or Warfield show. I'm going to find the tape.... my cassettes are sort of scattered since I don't listen to them much but I only got rid of certain ones so I think I still have it.  There were 2 Capitol Theaters; Passaic NJ and Port Chester NY. They did do some acoustic sets at the NY Cap in 1970, but I don't think that's the argument show."

grateful_dead,38ct9e,JamBandLinkerBot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:00:43 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Tina Turner versions of article  Proud Mary:       Ike & Tina Turner first covered ""Proud Mary"" in 1970. This version was released as a single from their Workin' Together album and the song differed greatly from the structure of the original, but is also well known and has become one of Tina Turner's most recognizable signature songs. The Turners' version was substantially rearranged by Soko Richardson   and Ike Turner. The song started off with a slow, sultry soulful tone in which Tina introduced the song and warned the audience that she and the band were gonna start it off ""nice and easy"" as ""we never do nothing nice and easy"" but said they would finish it ""nice and rough"". After the lyrics are first sung softly by the Turners, the song is then turned into a funk rock vamp with Tina and the Ikettes delivering gospel-influenced vocals. It reached #4 on the pop charts on March 27, 1971, two years to the week after Creedence Clearwater Revival's version was at its peak, and won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Group in 1972.

Hell, I feel like listing them all because they're so good.   Overall, I feel like the weir/barlow partnership was a great one. Lots of synergy between their styles - RH was definitely built more for Jerry IMO.   Some favorite lyrics:  ""Farer thee well now, let your life proceed by its own design. Nothin to tell now, let the words be yours I'm done with mine"" - one of my favorite lines period.   ""Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore. Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door""   Despite his great stuff, I also think JPB had some cliches in his work that Hunter was able to avoid. Some of it was just downright corny (gentleman start your engines), and his more political/activist tunes (we can run, parts of throwing stones) I don't think are quite as timeless as RH lyrics."

grateful_dead,387xqj,bitter_twin_farmer,3,Tue Jun 2 14:21:00 2015 UTC,How is it that shows that are taped legally can be pulled for copyright violation? The deadpod isn't trying to profit... I don't understand.
grateful_dead,387xqj,patent_that_trex_now,6,Tue Jun 2 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"As is often the case, there's a big difference between ""can"" and ""should."" This is unfortunate, but well within everyone's rights.  If you're looking for an actual answer:  Mostly, it comes down to the fact that there are different rights in the recordings and in the songs themselves, and the limited scope of permission given to tapers. Who owns the rights to actual recording in the tapes? Probably the taper who made it. Who owns the rights to the songs that were recorded? The songwriter. The thing is, the rights to the tapes are meaningless without the rights to the songs.  Deadheads have been given a kind of blanket, non-exclusive license to use the tapes for personal use. It was always understood, I think, that we weren't supposed to be selling tapes. Trading was okay because even that was fairly limited and distribution took some work. Now that distribution has changed and relies on ""digital transmission,"" for which there is actually a special right under US law, the Dead and (especially) the Garcia Estate have changed the scope of those permissions as far as digital content is concerned.  So, yeah, it sucks, but they're totally within their power to do it."
grateful_dead,387xqj,MrCompletely,3,Tue Jun 2 14:46:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the explanation. It sucks that they're going after these sorts of shows. I don't think I buy less JGB releases because I can listen to shows on the Deadpod, but somebody getting the paychecks must think that's the case.   So are the dead shows next?"
grateful_dead,387xqj,wilbard,2,Tue Jun 2 15:28:16 2015 UTC,I seriously doubt it. Totally different management with a different POV.

grateful_dead,384wax,MrCompletely,9,Mon Jun 1 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"Well I was happily reading Hannah Arendt and Philip K Dick, but then a newborn appeared and all time for such fancy things has evaporated. My only reading now is googling ""Is X normal for a baby"" every half hour, haha.  My favorite musical discovery of the past couple weeks has to be Matana Roberts -- she's so far released 3 stellar chapters of an anticipated 12-volume work chronicling the life of an American slave named Coin Coin. It's remarkably powerful and creative avant-garde jazz with a freshness and raw, biting energy that I hear very few jazz artists pulling off these days.  A while back a friend introduced me to this 1970 album by Demon Fuzz called Afreaka!, and I've had it playing a ton. It's a pretty unique blend of afro-jazz-rock and very much worth checking out, if you haven't."
grateful_dead,384wax,wilbard,2,Tue Jun 2 01:33:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reminding me that I need to listen to that 3rd volume of Coin Coin again. It's just so different from the first two that it really threw me for a loop and I need to give it a closer listen.  Volume 1 is the most harrowing jazz album I've ever heard, it's really a powerful experience. I'd love to see her live sometime, but it seems like she rarely tours outside of NYC.  I like what I hear from this Demon Fuzz album too, thanks for posting!"

On the Dead from I've been soaking in the new Dave's Pick and using that as an excuse to review the prior Academy releases.  Anyway the Academy stuff is great.  Been checking out the previews from the upcoming Phish release, Amsterdam '97. If you have a skeptic's interest in Phish, I think this is the one to check out. The mix is brilliant and the playing is great.  I had a pretty good phase digging back into some of my weird favorites from the 1980s and early mid 90s:  Spacemen 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGFZrtryHBw  E.A.R. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80Rdh5tMN10  Spectrum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xEuTW7NYf0  And early, small band Spiritualized https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGgAK43cobQ  I'm finally reading Billy's book along with So Many Roads and both are pretty entertaining. I'm also trying to finish a great book of semi-SF short stories called Cosmicomics by Italo Calvino - they're light and fun and easy to read but also incredibly smart and thoughtful. The library wants that one back before too long.  Before that I was on a Weird SF binge with a re-read of M. John Harrison's sincerely mindbending K-Tract series (Light, Nova Swing, Empty Space), Gibson's Peripheral and Jeff Vandermeer's Annihilation."

grateful_dead,384wax,pun-toting-maniac,2,Wed Jun 3 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"I spent an extended weekend at the Nelsonville Music Fest in Ohio, roughing it in a tent (located directly behind my car in a campground literally less than a mile from town, but just ignore that bit) and crossing a lot of amazing acts off of my bucket list. So, decompressing from that, I've spent the week mostly listening to the acts I saw, such as:   Mavis Staples (Who puts on a hell of a show still. She covered Talking Heads' ""Slippery People"" and definitely noticed me singing along) Built to Spill (Great show; very loud and jammed-out) Flaming Lips (Another very loud and jammed-out show. Just a totally unique experience. I was front row for them, BtS, and Mavis and it was amazing, if horrible on my back. 100/10 would do again.) Ezra Furman (Puts on a wild, rocking, high-energy show. Definite recommend) Michael Hurley (Possibly one of my favorite acts in retrospect. Old time folk singer, very good music.) Samantha Crain (Great woman, funny, wonder songwriter)   I had the chance to see Merle Haggard, as he was the last act of the weekend, but I decided to pass. I was completely burnt out on Sunday, and I had my opportunity to get out without fighting traffic and everyone else trying to leave the campsite at the same time. All in all, it was a great time. Glad I went.  Outside of that, I've been listening to bits and pieces here and there, and catching up on podcasts I missed over the weekend.  On the reading front, I've been making my way through A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole. It's a hilarious, wonderfully-written book that I made partway through in high school, and then put it down until I restarted it a few weeks ago."

I'm on the home stretch in terms of studio albums that I deem worth buying and am yet to hear. Only two or three left. Plus, I scoured the net and snagged a ton of bootlegs of his. Been loving the Desire outtakes and Basement Tapes.  If you're a fan of Dylan, but never dug deep, check out this song. I think this is one of the best songs he's ever written, but I get the feeling most people who aren't big fans won't have heard it.  Apart from him, a fair bit of Nick Drake, Damien Rice, Bon Iver, and Jacques Brel.  Dead-wise, I've been thrashing 4/26/72 - you can just wallow in that Truckin/Drums/Other One for days - , 2/24/74, and 10/27/79.  I've been reading Susanna Clarke's Jonathon Strange and Mr Norrell, about two magicians (doing actual magic) in Victorian-era England. I'll hit halfway tonight and take a break for a while. I'm gonna start re-reading Animorphs, a series of books I read as a teenager, about a group of kids who find out the world is being invaded by slug aliens that go in peoples ears, into their brains and control them. A friendly alien gives them the power to change into any animal, and the kids then have to engage in guerilla warfare against these aliens."

grateful_dead,384wax,wilbard,2,Thu Jun 18 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"Lately i've been reading religious/philosophical texts, the Koran, Tao Te Ching, and Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis (that man is insanely brilliant). I find different religions and philosophies absolutely fascinating.  My listening for Dead has been lots of 71, and other then that, a lot of rap. I know rap about drug dealing and violence is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but i find it so interesting. It tells a story about a life and struggle i know nothing about. One of my favorites right now is a young kid, age 20 i believe, out of the southside of Chicago (dubbed Chiraq due to having a murder rate close to that of the deaths in Iraq), named Lil' Bibby. why i am so in to him right now is because about a year or so ago, i watched an interview with him, and he was asked about education. He stated he didn't believe in education, and he would not go back to high school to get his degree. He said that in his environment, education got you nowhere. drug dealing was the only source of real income you could come into, and something along the lines of that if he were to get out of the ghetto he was born into, that is the only way he saw of getting out (before rapping). It's a state of mind i know nothing about, and will never understand. However, i saw an interview with him again the other day. He said that he got his GED, and that he is going to go to college, and he wants to get a doctorate in Sociology or Psychology. I find it really inspirational, so i have been listening to him a bit lately."

Bibby definitely is a trap/drill rap artist, but why i like him more than other artists in the genre is that he doesn't always rap positively about drug dealing and killing- he talks about its downsides and how he would like to get away from it as weill"

The tl;dr is that we exist because we had rather large disagreements with the head mod over there.  We're not going to merge, and yes I realize it's slightly inconvenient but such is life."

grateful_dead,36via2,abud1,3,Fri May 22 14:06:55 2015 UTC,it's fun going back and seeing what i upvoted 10 months ago
grateful_dead,36via2,TurkandJD,5,Fri May 22 21:33:10 2015 UTC,So it's cool to dis on Donna here? Not that I am going to. Just a hypothetical.
grateful_dead,36via2,MrCompletely,5,Fri May 22 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"Shut up, Donna!"
grateful_dead,36via2,space_ape71,3,Fri May 22 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"it's not that cool but it is certainly allowed, that's basically the difference"
grateful_dead,36via2,uponscrutiny,2,Sat May 23 17:33:00 2015 UTC,Can we diss Brent and his disputed singing ability? Or the fact he left his kids out of his will despite writing a song for his daughter? Too soon?
grateful_dead,36via2,aequitas3,2,Fri May 29 02:08:12 2015 UTC,only if i can dis on that fucker bobby too!  fucker
grateful_dead,36via2,beepboopblorp,3,Fri May 22 20:42:15 2015 UTC,Hey now! We love Bobby and his jorts (especially his jorts) 'round these parts.
grateful_dead,36via2,beepboopblorp,3,Fri May 22 22:02:27 2015 UTC,These here parts are just Bobby' balls hanging out of the legs of his jorts as far as the eye can see.

Bob is usually so humble in interviews, it's interesting to read him say he was born with perfect time. A lot has been said about Phil having perfect pitch."
grateful_dead,36ogb8,whenthattrainrollsby,3,Thu May 21 10:15:48 2015 UTC,"he's got great time, it's probably his best musical strength, and he's being nice about Garcia's timekeeping, which might have been his musical weak point overall (especially when faded)"

Seems that it was a big influence on the Dead when Silent Way and Bitches Brew came out, but more importantly when Miles and crew opened for the Dead at the Fillmore West shortly after Bitches Brew came out."
grateful_dead,36ogb8,DownvoteGargler,2,Fri May 22 23:55:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it's this weekend! Finally."
grateful_dead,36ogb8,whenthattrainrollsby,3,Fri May 22 15:11:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like they might play quite a few older songs that haven't seen the stage in decades. God I'd love to hear a roaring Alligator > Caution live but alas, not going to these shows. And well, of course, Pigpen and Jerry won't be on vocals and lead guitar - that's a huge deal. I don't think the music can possibly live up the band at their best but it should be a great time just being there."
grateful_dead,36ogb8,EvilLinux,3,Thu May 21 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"Furthur played a lot of old tunes, including the two you mentioned. Ths website lists their April 2013 tour:  http://www.thebarnpresents.com/visual-setlists-furthur-spring-tour-2013-13659.html"
grateful_dead,36ogb8,whenthattrainrollsby,2,Thu May 21 10:10:23 2015 UTC,Wasnt that what put Furthur up a notch higher than the playing alone? Those great setlists just were so much fun to be at while they were unfolding in front of your....ears...
grateful_dead,36ogb8,Rotationation,2,Fri May 22 01:49:59 2015 UTC,"That was part of it, but for me, it was the Lesh-Weir interplay that was somehow lost in the mud of The Dead or The Other Ones.  I enjoyed Phil and Friends and Furthur much more than The Dead and The Other Ones."
grateful_dead,36ogb8,dwenius,2,Fri May 22 12:12:43 2015 UTC,Same for me. I knew JK is a decent guitarist but for me it was watching bobby and Phil interact musically that made seeing Furthur excellent. Totally locked.
