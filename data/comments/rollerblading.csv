The beginning of this video shows you how to leverage them out. If the hubs have been loosened a little they should just slide out, but if they're tight, be gentle and work patiently in a circle until they're all the way out.

rollerblading,3e3ehk,FRGL1,3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"I suggest weighting your back to prolong the pain. It helps build strength in your core. You don't want to overdo it, but it will accelerate your muscle growth. When you feel ready to take off the weights you'll feel little to no strain on your back.  Always stretch before and after sessions."

Coarse tarmac will slow you right down though. Have you thought about getting bigger (80mm+) wheels and frames?

rollerblading,3e1m1n,Largesaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"On roads that aren't terrible and not for actual transportation over longer distances, yes 60mm would be tolerable. It all depends on the wheels and the roads though, on especially rough paths it can be tough to maintain momentum even on 80mm. There are some wheels made in the 70mm range mostly for roller hockey and thus are rather soft, but I think it could become popular as the midway between aggressive and big wheel."

rollerblading,3dy9j0,Private_Stock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"I think there's a place for skates that aren't readily serviceable. In order to make everything replaceable, you need to make some design sacrifices. I'm rocking fatty's at the moment and I appreciate how the boot feels like one integrated piece. I mean having the buckle riveted on definitely sucks but for the most part I'm glad they didn't change too much with these.  And K2's are generally pretty cheap. I know this isn't necessarily true of everyone- but by the time I wear out souls, my boot is ready to be replaced as well anyway.  These aren't for everyone, but for guys like me they're almost perfect. I just wish I could have the old school backslide plate on my natural backslide foot."
rollerblading,3dy9j0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Mon Jul 20 22:55:25 2015 UTC,And K2's are generally pretty cheap.   Well according to the article   As far as I’m aware these are due for release Feb 2016 (unconfirmed) and will retail at £200 with the ‘Front Street’ being the lower end model at nearer to £140.   If those prices are accurate that would be $311 (US) for the Unnatural and $217 for the Front Street model. Neither of those is really in the price point range.  I just don't think anyone should be paying over $300 for a skate with souls glued to the boot and riveted buckles. IMO that needs to change between prototype and the actual release otherwise this seems like an out-of-touch move on k2's end.

rollerblading,3dvb3n,probablytonystark,3,Sun Jul 19 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"Are you new to skating/Has it been a really long time since the last time?  New skaters have two physical limitations: New boots and new feet. You feet need to get used to the lessened blood flow, and your liners need to get used to your feet. It's going to be a painful process, but a necessary wall to climb if you really want to skate.  Don't loosen your skates while skating: You're increasing your risk of twisting your ankle in a fall.  Some liners are more comfortable than others. I've been riding SEBAs for a few weeks and put on my old 2013 Rollerblade Twisters and rediscovered how painful they are for me to skate in. I was used to the pain when they were my only pair, but now I consider them impossible to rock.  If the pain is just too much to tolerate, or if it persists over a very long period of time with no obvious signs of getting any better, then you could look into gel insoles.  Skates take about a month or two of skating to break in. If you want to accelerate the process, just wear your skates all the time at home, as much as you can tolerate. Your feet will be different. They can adjust in a week or in 6 months. Just wearing your skates won't do much: You need to actually be out there skating.  You can also slide your frames left or right. Sometimes, frame alignment contributes to foot pain. If you feel soreness at the front right of the boot, you slide the frame so it's closer towards the pain, supporting your foot in that area and hopefully minimizing the physical stress.  In summary, the reasons your feet are hurting, and potential solutions are as follows:   New boots - Wear them in New feet - Keep skating Bad liner - try a gel insole Poor frame alignment - Adjust it None of those work - buy a different liner (moldable)?"
rollerblading,3dvb3n,FRGL1,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"This is great info - and like he said if you wear them around the house, say an hour or two at a time during work, Netflix, gaming, etc. Then it will help acclimate you."
rollerblading,3dvb3n,Omelette-King,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"I do stress actually skating, because a lot of the pressure that starves your feet of blood rich oxygen comes from the cuff pressing against your veins from ankle flexion during a stride."

rollerblading,3dvb3n,cyanicenine,2,Mon Jul 20 08:16:50 2015 UTC,I feel like getting an insole should be higher up.  When you have your feet locked into a rigid boot like that it really needs to be properly supported.    This is why every boot fitter in the ski industry insists on putting in a custom footbed before they even try to do any boot work on your shell.  More often than not a properly fitted footbed will solve a lot of your foot pain problems.

rollerblading,3dtw38,what_is_this_life,4,Sun Jul 19 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"Chris Haffey's drip drop section always seems to leave an impression on non rollerbladers. Broskows sections are all outstanding, but it's so technical that it's hard to comprehend what he's doing, even for avid rollerbladers. Haffey, on the other hand, skates with such magnitude that everyone can appreciate that the stuff he's doing is incredibly difficult."

rollerblading,3dt5l8,AndrewKemendo,2,Sun Jul 19 15:08:18 2015 UTC,diff in natural and unnatural????
rollerblading,3dt5l8,classicalkungfu,3,Sun Jul 19 07:07:37 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the ""Front Street"" vs. Unnatural differences are next to is negligible, similar to the Fatty Pro vs. Varsity, close to the same skate with a few changes.  Based on the catalog page the only spec differences I see listed are that the Front Streets have 56mm wheels (or is it 58mm?) and the Unnatural's have 60mm wheels. The Toe cap on the Front Street also extends closer to the backslide plate than on the Unnatural. But even that is pretty much the same as the Fatty Pro vs. Varsity skates.  New names, new colors, and Kaltik frames that say k2 on them? I'm not sure but that's my guess based on these pictures that started floating around yesterday.   Edit: Credit where it's due though, the ""Uptown"" skate frames look much better.. I just couldn't get behind the frames on the most recent Il Capo. Give me some color options but I don't want or need graphics... I know they're a ski company but their blading frames don't need to look like their skis do."

I never get anyone saying anything because I'm on rollerblades, and even if you knew the people beforehand, most people are accepting. A trick is a trick, and no one's going to look down on you because you're learning. Anyone who goes to the skate park knows what it's like to start out, no matter what we ride.  I understand older bladers had to go through a lot of bullshit, but it has seemed to change for the better.  As for starting out, just ride up and down the ramps, and see how those feel. Eventually you'll start feeling more comfortable doing vertical stuff. You seemed to be experienced at riding inline, so I think you'll pick up the aggressive aspects quickly. Maybe someone more experienced can comment on that."

Tldr: grow some balls and hit the park."
rollerblading,3dpm13,bl8alex,2,Sat Jul 18 10:07:29 2015 UTC,"I'm 24 and just started back into rollerblading this year as soon as it was nice enough out to skate. I had very similar concerns so I completely understand what you're talking about.   Like others have said the best time to go is early in the morning. You'll likely have the entire park to yourself to fall and get through your awkward phase. When you're first learning to inline it can look very awkward, but honestly it's all about the attitude you go to a skatepark with. The best method to ensure less name calling is to talk to a few of the skateboarders, mention you're just starting out, and make a few jokes about it. If you can laugh at yourself then you'll be in on the joke, not the joke itself.   I'm only a few months into blading but so far all the skateboarders I've come across have been great to me. I've also had a bunch of smaller kids really interested in what I was doing, they're full of questions because it's not something they come across very often.  Also about not being experienced in grinding, it can be really tough at first. You really need to know where your feet are. It's really easy to overshoot the grinding obstacle and slip out. If you don't want to go to a skatepark just yet, your best place to practice is the curb. Just practice stalling soul, acid, mizou, pornstar, frontside, and backside. It will get you comfortable with the balance of each grind, and will help you learn where your feet should be. I'd recommend jumping with both feet into the stalls as soon as possible as you'll be doing it for all your grinds later on. When you do go to the skatepark bring some wax with you, it'll make grinding a lot smoother and easier to learn. Word of advice though, skateboarders tend to not like waxed obstacles, so ask the ones that are using it if it's alright before doing it.  Once you're able to comfortably ride on a halfpipe, around the park, and be able to lock in grinds, your confidence will go through the roof. Have fun!"
rollerblading,3dpm13,Tunes_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:22:51 2015 UTC,"Alot of people hear have already told you its not a big deal and they are right. I'm going to offer an alternative though since you mentioned the parks are an hour away. How about building your own stuff? Got room for a practice rail? There is a $20 DIY rail in the Getting Started tab at the top of the page. You can also build a little quarter pipe pretty easy if you've got the space and tools. If you dont have the tools Home Depot has a Loan-A-Tool option. You shouldn't be worried about what other people at the park say, but it doesn't hurt to have some confidence in your ability first."

rollerblading,3dmejw,TreeJib,4,Fri Jul 17 16:56:09 2015 UTC,Wizard frames are made by Leon and they're expensive because they're made in very tiny runs.  If they were mass produced they would be cheaper.  Thanks for the props.

The skating is on point as always, but the skates caught my attention.  Those skates look pretty sweet, and it looks like they've redesigned the souls since the varsity's if I'm seeing correctly. How do they ride? What are the white bits protruding from the souls? UHMW?  I could be pretty tempted to pick a pair them up, but the whole orange on black look that seems to be ""in"" with rollerblading just now looks horrible to me. Of course, it might just be my screen being shitty. But they look orangey in some shots, and pretty lightish brown in other."
rollerblading,3dmejw,MN_MilkPlus,2,Fri Jul 17 15:11:07 2015 UTC,They ride really well especially for a prototype.  White bits are teflon.  Camel much classier than orange

rollerblading,3dlh2d,FRGL1,2,Fri Jul 17 06:01:38 2015 UTC,Interesting that you have outer wear on your front wheel and inner wear on your back! Very unusual I think.  I tend to wear out the front wheels on the inside much quicker. It's down to all my weight pushing from the from wheel but I also do alot of hills and have a terrible 'dragging' habit!

rollerblading,3dkvet,Urban4me,2,Fri Jul 17 02:23:31 2015 UTC,"100mm wheels are way too big for a beginner. It's kind of like giving a sports car to a kid with a learner's permit when they'd be better off learning to drive in their mothers sedan. Those are great skates but it's just not a model meant to learn with.  This is a closeout so there aren't many size options left, but the Rollerblade Maxxum 84 is a bit more appropriate for a beginner. Basically you'll want to look for skates designed to house wheels in the 80-84mm range. Anything larger is likely to make the learning process unnecessarily difficult and protracted though not impossible. Rollerblade, Seba and k2 are all quality skate manufacturers.  Edit: spelling."
rollerblading,3dkvet,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:33:10 2015 UTC,Ok so would the Twister 80 or Macroblade 84 Alu by Rollerblade would make good alternatives? Also to add thank you for your response.
rollerblading,3dkvet,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Jul 17 03:52:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, personally of the two options I would go for the Twister 80, but it depends on what you're trying to achieve with your skate. The Twister is an urban style skate which is meant for tricks, jumps, cruising fast and tight maneuverability.  The Macroblade would be more appropriate for someone who is just looking to do some recreational/fitness skating. e.g. going out and cruising around the neighborhood or skating a few miles on a bike path."
rollerblading,3dkvet,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:58:36 2015 UTC,"So I would be able to achieve longer distances with the Twister 80's then the Macroblade 84 Alu's, I would opt out for the twister pros but having no break available on the skates makes me feel a little uneasy about riding for I'm still learning how to stop."
rollerblading,3dkvet,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Jul 17 04:13:50 2015 UTC,"No, I think you misunderstood me or I was unclear. The Macroblade would be better suited to recreational/fitness skating. But you could achieve the same with the Twister model.  I said I would personally buy the twisters only because I've been skating for over 20 years and I need a high performance skate. It sounds like you're not very confident on skates yet and would probably be better off with the Rollerblade Macroblade or perhaps the k2 FIT 84 Boa. Both models are very beginner friendly and wallet friendly."
rollerblading,3dkvet,FRGL1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:23:53 2015 UTC,"Ok so basically now I think I get it, with the twisters being the high performance skate they will help me achieve higher results in a longer time without a need to replace them with a better skate as opposed to the macroblade then need to replace them after I desire better performance. I might get both of them just to be able to use the macroblade in the rain due to it's lower initial cost. As for the K2 Boa systems I'm looking to steer away from for I read some reviews about that system breaking after a few months of use."
rollerblading,3dkvet,FRGL1,2,Fri Jul 17 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, the twister is something you can learn on yet still use as you become a proficient skater without worrying about buying a new set which can match the needs of a more skilled blader.    I might get both of them just to be able to use the macroblade in the rain due to it's lower initial cost.   Well if you decide to do that, great, it's your money after all, and I myself own a few different pairs of skates and lots of frame/wheel options depending on what style of skating I'm trying to do. But skating in the rain is no fun. You should probably wait for the clouds to clear up!   As for the K2 Boa systems I'm looking to steer away from for I read some reviews about that system breaking after a few months of use.   I have not heard of any issues with the BOA lacing system but if you have then either of those two models from Rollerblade should suit you just fine."
rollerblading,3dkvet,DranDran,2,Fri Jul 17 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"Beginners who don't know what they want to do usually start on recreational skates with a wheelbase of 76-84mm. They buy soft boots if they aren't making a large commitment, want to save money, or want more comfort, and a hard boot if they intend to take skating more seriously or want more protection and support.   Skates that ride 4x80mm wheels can already be considered fitness skates, while anything over 4x90mm or 5x84mm is speed skate territory. People buy these if they're interested in long, relatively straight rides down smooth biking trails.   People who are interested in doing various tricks will want aggressive skates, which generally ride wheels under 70mm and have specialized boots.   So the definition of a good skate to start with changes depending on your intentions. If you feel like you made the right choice after going through my wall of text, then you're probably fine."

rollerblading,3dkff0,koopa69,2,Fri Jul 17 00:02:20 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you could use some Rollerblade Hydrogen wheels. Just be sure to select the ""80mm"" size option when you go to buy.  If you're interested in doing a bit of reading on the subject, here's an article reviewing many popular 80mm wheels currently on the market written by Joey McGarry which does include the Rollerblade Hydrogen wheels. Though it's written from the perspective of someone who uses their skates for tricks, not just commuting and exercise.   Since you specifically asked about ordering from Amazon I gave you a link to their buy option but in the future I would highly recommend ordering inline skates or replacement hardware from a reputable inline skate shop.  If you check the ""buyers guide"" tab at the top of this subreddit you'll find a list of skate shops which we recommend from around the world.   But if you're using your skates as much as it sounds like you might want to consider investing in a new pair soon!"
rollerblading,3dkff0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Jul 17 00:25:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I will probably buy a new pair in a few years, but this current pair has a lot of sentimental value that I can't quite leave behind. These wheels don't come with bearings, correct? I feel my wheels stuttering, and they only spin for like 3 seconds if I kick them against the ground. Do you have any suggestion of what sort of bearings I should buy? I really appreciate your comment. Looking at this site from the buyers guide I cannot tell the difference at all between bearings of different costs. Thank you. :)"
rollerblading,3dkff0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,3,Fri Jul 17 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"No problem, this is what I'm here for on /r/rollerblading!  You are correct, those wheels do not come with bearings, you'll need to buy a set. These Seba ILQ5 should suit your needs just fine without breaking the bank on a higher end swiss ceramic bearing which are great, but a hell of a lot more expensive.  You could go for the Seba ILQ7 bearings which are also listed on the shoptask website but I really don't think it would make a huge difference.  However, let me state for the record, I am of the mindset that there's no need for high end bearings. I believe mid range bearings will meet the needs of 99% of bladers out there.  Also, if you're unfamiliar with proper wheel maintenance here's a Wheel Rotation Guide. To get the most out of your wheels I usually recommend people rotate their wheels at least once a month or after 25 miles of use, whichever comes first. But generally speaking just rotate the wheels whenever they start to show noticeable wear on one side.  Edit: spelling."
rollerblading,3dkff0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Jul 17 01:11:35 2015 UTC,"I have been rotating my wheels just according to what looks good. I will take this guide when I rotate the new wheels though. :) Are there any bearings on Amazon you would personally recommend? I couldn't find any of the Seba brand. If there is no comparison, I would gladly buy from shop-task. I value my money like 50%  more than my amazon money though. :) Thank you!"
rollerblading,3dkff0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Jul 17 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I would just buy your bearings from Shop Task if that's an option for you. I don't buy skate hardware from Amazon so I usually feel uncomfortable recommending inline purchases from them because it's likely to be a Fulfilled by Amazon item (meaning a third party seller). Shop Task is an excellent shop though, they'll take care of you!"

It's strange that aggressive skate brands still don't seem to be willing to spend the money on a decent branded wheel for their skate models. The boot only/custom build movement really killed any incentive to do so but it's still perplexing to me because if they put out good wheels that would open up a whole new revenue stream.

I ordered a pair of FR1 Deluxe but didn't like them.  They were comfortable but they just felt waay too bulky for me, especially the cuff area.

rollerblading,3dj9h2,UncleCarnage,2,Thu Jul 16 21:57:31 2015 UTC,The price for blades seems to be fairly competitive on most online stores so you won't find a bigger difference than $5-10 dollars from what I've seen.   I just bought a pair of Seba FR1 from Pro Skaters place because I had heard nothing but good things about them and their quality.

Stock wheels are 85a  The standard twister does come with a brake. Wheels are 80a.  My major beef with twister is that it's boot mounts are at 185mm with some 3mm of leeway forwards and back, vs the standard 165 that most frames use. Otherwise its an okay skate. Between the pro and the regular, the boots are mostly identical."
rollerblading,3dj9h2,FRGL1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:13:35 2015 UTC,can you explain this boot mount stuff? very new
rollerblading,3dj9h2,Colderblader,2,Fri Jul 17 05:23:09 2015 UTC,"The anatomy of a skate is as follows:  The boot consists of a shell and a liner. Your foot goes in the liner, and the liner goes in the shell. A soft boot has a minimal, open shell and the liner comprises most of the skate's exterior. A hard boot has an enclosed shell that makes the skate more rigid.  Below your skate are the frames. You wheels go into the frames, and the frames are secured to the boot through screws that go into the heel and sole of the boot.  Mounting distance is the distance between the center points of the screws that hold these two parts, the boot and the frame, together. 165mm is the most widely used distance, though many products have more or less space between their mounting points.  Some of the better products have variable mounting points on both boot and frame to accommodate to these exceptions. Twister boots are not one of them.  So, with a Twister, if you decide one day that you want to buy a new frame, you have to be very careful what you buy or you'll waste a hundred bucks on a compacted soda can that doesn't fit your skates."

Nothing weird about one leg being stronger than the other, everyone has that to some extent.    Regarding wheels, buy the best you can afford. Apart from comfort, the wheels are the most important part of your skates, putting you in contact with the ground. A good brand of wheel will last much longer than standard wheels that come with skates. Go for something from SEBA, Powerslide, K2...

Regarding hardness and grip: a 90a performance/top price wheel will probably have more grip than a 86a cheap wheel. The wheel hardness is a good measure of how grippy and solid a wheel is, but you really get what you pay for. Stop looking at the figures and read reviews instead. The same goes for bearings; you can get a cheap ABEC 9 for less money than a good, basic bearing without an ABEC rating (e.g. Bones Reds), but the performance of the two is completely different.

Your skate setup is up to you, but as an advocate of slalom for mastering basic mechanics, I also advocate rockered wheels, which are harder to do in the 90mm range (I do try at 84-90-90-90).  Even though you're putting 80mm wheels in, it's still (I assume) a 273mm skating frame. IMO you may as well just keep using 90mm in them until you decide to get an 80mm frame.  If you like the cone dancing then I do suggest learning how to ride a full rocker ASAP. It's going to be less stable than a flat setup and changes the way you rotate your wheels.  You may know this, but you can rocker by buying different sized wheels: 76-80-80-76. Alternatively, you can buy a prerockered frame so you only have to buy the same sized wheels. SEBA's rocker has a displacement of 2mm. These setups won't feel right on a 90mm wheelbase frame, so just go with what you have for now and progress at your own pace.  Also, be careful while walking the dog. I've seen cyclists get hurt trying to control runaway dogs."
rollerblading,3dhsd5,Sanit,2,Thu Jul 16 11:27:23 2015 UTC,Go to Riverside Skatepark. It's a great place to meet other rollers. They usually session the park and then hit some street spots.  There are some insanely good skaters in NYC. Good luck and have fun!  *Here's a video edit I did several years ago. It should help to give you an idea: https://youtu.be/hj8iaijEqXs
rollerblading,3dhsd5,SoManyMinutes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:41:19 2015 UTC,There is a Wednesday Night Skate that meets on the north side of Union Square. They leave at 8pm. They get a pretty large group of skaters. Go there and you can find out about all the other group skates. You can also google The Empire Skate Club for info.

Here's where you can find local history and edits: https://irollny.wordpress.com/  Lots of NYC crew hit up the rollerblade only sessions at Oil City Skate park just outside of the city. Within manhattan you've got a beginner park in Tribeca (Harrison and West side highway) and another at Coleman skate park (monroe and market) and an advanced park at Chelsea piers. There are also parks in brooklyn, the bronx, and queens that are pretty good, but all NYC parks are small (west coast US has the much larger parks)  There used to be big summer contest every year, IMYTA, last man standing, real street contests like the NYC street invitational, but as far as I know there is nothing ""major"" this summer but there is this new contest movement that just started: https://irollny.wordpress.com/2015/07/13/new-york-skate-series/  If you're really good I've got some contact info for good guys, I'm just getting back into it after taking a 5yr break so you probably don't want to skate with me.

Yeah much flatter, I'm used to an anti-rocker setup so the FR1's certainly had a lot more grip but I didn't find so much of an issue although hockey stops felt like they'd be impossible, the issue was edge control as even in a straight line it felt like the skates wanted to be on the inside or outside edge.     I sort of regret not giving them longer, wouldn't certainly make my daily commute easier."
rollerblading,3dhizv,kaozennrk,2,Thu Jul 16 10:11:31 2015 UTC,"As a 20+ year 76mm or 80mm wheel rider who does spin tricks, jumps and hockey stops and the occasional stair rides I've always been too proud to use aggressive skate wheels- sure I could grind better and do more tricks, but I'd lose my speed and ability to navigate the urban jungle keeping up with cars. Just saying that if you keep at it you can get a crossover between both aggressive and speed worlds. I see people on aggressive skates with flat wheels and I feel like they are ""cheating"" :)"
rollerblading,3dggxo,haisojoko,2,Thu Jul 16 02:07:23 2015 UTC,"I'll try to research the measurements for you, but in the meantime be aware that the mounting heads can be adjusted if you remove the liner. I'll get back to you later."
rollerblading,3dggxo,FRGL1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! I tried looking at powerslide vi's, but haven't had any luck in finding out whether they'd match."
rollerblading,3dggxo,FRGL1,2,Thu Jul 16 02:29:55 2015 UTC,"With adjustments, the Twister 80's boot mounts from (roughly) 177-188mm. These measurements apply to the 2013 model.  The Twister 80 frame advertises the standard mounting points of 165, but these apply to the front two and back two pairs. In practice, the stock frame mounts using the forward front and rear back mounts at a rough distance of 185mm  You'll need a frame that has accessible mounts at this distance.  I found this on SkateLog. It's pointing at Luigino Z-Frame, which are 110mm but that's between your range of 100 and 125. The mounting points have a similar setup to the stock T80 frame. Take caution: The thread I linked you to has criticism concerning the weakness of the Z Frame. It's supposedly okay for street riding but won't fare well in any attempted speed skating.  Powerslide has this at 165mm for the forward back and rear mounting points, but there's a second slot up front that looks like it could take a mounting screw. That may give you the extra 12mm you need to mount it.  The best thing you can do is to take a measuring tape that does centimeters (those usually do millimeters, too) and measure the minimum and maximum clearance your mounting heads give, and provide this information to any shops you're prospecting. Remember to measure from the center of where the well is, not the edge."

rollerblading,3dfd1d,Lokeku,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:53:50 2015 UTC,I actually own a pair of usd evo's that I got a long time ago but never used. They run pretty narrow so remember that. An ill fitted pair of skates can really make learning seem impossible and just down right unappealing. That being said what's your size? I'd sell you mine for way less than retail if you're interested. They're just taking up space.
rollerblading,3dfd1d,PraiseTheBlaze,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:36 2015 UTC,I'm size 44.5 and i heard they can be a little tight so i thought about buying a size 46
rollerblading,3dfd1d,FRGL1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:02 2015 UTC,Its a good idea to try a pair in the store to figure out what's comfortable. First time skaters need to break in their feet as well as their boots. If you get a size too large you may feel they're too small after several months.
rollerblading,3dfd1d,NewYorkCityGent,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is that i don't  have any store that sells aggressive skates nearby so i need to order them online therefore i can't try them. But i can try some normal skates, don't know if they'll be similar. And if they're a little big can't i use pads or whatever they're called or is it not recomended?"
rollerblading,3dfd1d,PraiseTheBlaze,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"If they're a little big you can try another liner, use thick socks and/or carve up some Dr. Schools to add into the liner.

rollerblading,3dfd1d,PraiseTheBlaze,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:14:16 2015 UTC,I had the same issue when I bought these. I have no stores near by. They seem to maintain the same width they just get longer so I'm not sure about sizing up. I'm guessing you're not from the U.S. ?   To elaborate. A size 10-12 can share the same boot in the usd evo's if I'm not mistaken its something like that and the liner will only be getting longer not wider
rollerblading,3dfd1d,FiscHwaecg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:28:58 2015 UTC,I'm from EU. Also one of the things i want to know is if they can handle 100kg. I'm a heavy man but i'm a beginner so i probably won't be too hard on the skates for some weeks.
rollerblading,3ddyww,dyn4styw4rrior,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"I have flat feet. My shoe size is US 8.5 wide, but I wear US 11 skates to accommodate my feet, and I have toe wiggle. I do slalom with this setup, which is known for requiring high precision equipment. The important thing is that your feet are not lifting up at the sole or the heel, that they aren't sliding forwards and backwards or side to side. Mine are secure and do not move inside the boot.  You have a soft boot, which is meant to be more comfortable and won't be as secure as a full shell boot. K2 Skates has a lot of competitive yet economically priced soft boot skates.  If you're looking to splurge, my advice can only apply to hard shell boots, as those are the only skates I've worn up until now. That being the case, a good fitting hard shell skate will be VERY tight when laced and strapped up. It should be comfortable enough to have on unlaced, but you should feel lots of uneven pressure from the unworn liner.  First time skaters (and those who haven't skated in a while) generally need to acclimate their feet to the rigors of skating, so these people experience a longer period of initial discomfort with a new skate.  What are you trying to do with your skates? These days all I do is worship SEBA, but if you're just looking to have some fun on something different then SEBA (and RollerBlade Twister, for that matter) are a little more than you'd need."
rollerblading,3ddyww,FRGL1,2,Wed Jul 15 18:38:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that :) To start with, I'm just looking to skate around the suburbs for fitness. Once I get a bit better, I might start doing tricks and at that time I'll probably invest in a decent pair of urban/freestyle boots. I'm still not familiar with the concept of hard/soft shell boots though. At this time I'm worried if I should endeavour for an all round snug fit but your situation makes not see so absolute, which helps since I have trouble finding good fitting shoes anyway. The rollerblades fit well in the way you described in which they need to be :)"
rollerblading,3ddxc0,luciferisgreat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:49:28 2015 UTC,Do they have to be fitness/speed skates? I'm automatically thinking you want to get her 100mm wheels.

rollerblading,3ddxc0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the delayed reply but here you go!  Here's the k2 Alexis 84 Boa. This is available in a womens size 5 and should be a good beginner skate for your girlfriend. It's got 84mm wheels, decent bearings and well under your $250 budget.   Another option to consider is the Rollerblade Macroblade it features 84mm wheels like the k2 skate.  Unfortunately due to the small foot size your options are going to be limited. But I believe either of those skates would be good enough for a beginner blader without dropping a lot of money.  I can't speak to the quality of the wheels, but generally speaking, stock wheels tend to leave a lot to be desired so plan on replacing them with a higher quality wheel once they wear out. But that's a bridge you'll cross later down the line."

rollerblading,3db6a0,andreas542,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:22:08 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'm also realizing that a bigger frame will give me more wheel options than 72 or 76... guess it's aluminum.
rollerblading,3db6a0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"I don't plan to do much grinding on these (if any)   Here's my 2 cents. I say go for the RB UFS frames. The only point to the levels is if you planned to do some grinding. Aluminum has less bulk without sacrificing strength.   Aluminum frames are indeed more responsive, that's why you only really see plastic frames being used on low end recreational skates or aggressive blades... We use it because it's a necessity for grinding but plastic really isn't an ideal frame material for the actual act of rollerblading. Plus you can max out those RB frames with 84mm wheels which makes them an ideal UFS commuter frame.  When it comes to price $80 isn't too bad. After all the Seba UFS frames go for $180! I think the older graphics on the RB frames looked better than the current ones but at the end of the day that's not exactly a reason to avoid them."

Particularly if you are used to rolling in SEBAs, slalom will not be particularly enjoyable as the DOOP skates cant compete with the likes of a FR1 or Twister in terms of fit.   Yeah, they will grip your shoe tight enough (in that sense it dosnt exactly matter what kind of shoe you wear, but the tighter your foot in the shoe (sneakers for example are a better option), the better. Regardless, your foot wil always shift more than in a tight fitting standard skate, for sure, which is why they arent meant for slalom where millimetric precision and response counts.  My biggest issue with the DOOPS is the price, at that cost you can get Twisters or FR1s, for what is basically a skate you can only use for leisurely strolls around town. If you can grab a pair cheap fro 100-125 bucks Id say go for it."
rollerblading,3d8a8h,DranDran,2,Tue Jul 14 08:32:24 2015 UTC,"Heh, I expected that, and read similar on a dead forum a while ago.  I can price match down to 130 for the Classic, but I'm holding out to see if there are any issues with using different frames. I want to stick to 80mm so I can be lazy in buying new wheels.  Knowing that I can't do anything fancy in them definitely motivates me to focus on budget rather than performance. At least most of them come with aluminum frames. Cheers!"
rollerblading,3d8a8h,DranDran,2,Tue Jul 14 08:41:29 2015 UTC,"Do let me know your experience with them! I know I cant expect to jump and slalom in them, but you are right, sometimes being able to have somethig you can slip on and off in a cinch is all you need to get around town. :)"
rollerblading,3d8a8h,raddads,2,Tue Jul 14 08:54:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, Doops are the first ones I bought specifically because I didn't want to screw up shoe sizing while buying online. I love em! Here is my experience with them:     Pros:  *wicked stylish  *pretty fast  *stock easily replaceable  *fits over just about any shoe  *comfortable  *slip on and off with relative ease once you get used to them  *pretty easy to adjust the size (especially the freestyle III 2015)  *easy to control     the best shoe is a flat shoe. Think a pair of chucks (Vans and Converse are my preferred for these skates)     Cons:  *Adjusting size: I know this is also a pro, but keep in mind that the cheaper model (classic reds) will hold in place better, although there is this annoying screw you have to deal with. That aside, it's a ""one and done"" adjustment. With the more expensive model, it's easier to adjust but they can sometimes come a bit loose. There is a way to fix it though.  *stock wheels kind of shitty: they ain't bad but you can definitely get some better wheels/ bearings for a more lubricated and better spin. I got better wheels and bearings on my Urbans, and they are so much better. But the stock wheels will atleast do you justice.  *heavy: they are a lot heavier than I thought.  *bulky: I bought them expecting to get something I could toss in my LL Bean packpack. Unfortunately they just manage to squeeze into my Rick Stevens travel bag when it is in suitcase mode. I might look into getting a collapsable gym bag or something for them because I wish I could carry them with me casually. (I'll upload pics a bit later).  *not a ton of tricks you can do with them: I knew this when I bought them. I couldn't tell you if it's a good idea or not to strap an h block to them. I got these so I could travel fast-ish and learn to skate, get used to speed, and keep balance.      All in all I love these skates and they are pretty solid! The pros outweigh the cons. Hope this was helpful! I bought mine from roller warehouse.     Edit to fix formatting, phone autocorrect, and add a detail     Here is an example of how they only fit into much larger bags:     http://imgur.com/WfuWhGj  http://imgur.com/dKKD9ms  http://imgur.com/PJdo0ft  http://imgur.com/V19vD7g"

rollerblading,3d7kml,thisismy20,0,Tue Jul 14 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"K2 Skates are economic options for casual recreational use. The standard FIT 80 model goes for about $100.  Putting it straight, ""durable"" costs about $200.  For all things basic, I worship Bill Stoppard.  For balance, I point to Kompa Kombo.  Copying the fuck out of those videos will burn the basics into your skull. Note that slalom is hard if you are riding flat (same size) wheels. Stick to the Stoppard bible for a month and then move into KK's playlist after you've worn in a natural rocker.  When in doubt, pad it out."
rollerblading,3d6aqz,blckmtlrbtdth,4,Mon Jul 13 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"According to this One Magazine interview from late March they were due for a worldwide release in May 2015 so I assume they've run into delays.  The skate is all one material but the thicknesses vary around the boot/soulframe/frame to account for abuse from aggressive skating without relying on lots of replacement parts like on UFS skates. If I had to guess, I imagine they may have encountered some inconsistencies once they tried to do large runs of the skate with their manufacturer.    But if that were true, it's strange that Kenneth Dedeu would still be saying they were due for a release in about 1.5-2 months from the time that article was printed.  It's really anyones guess though. It's not like skate companies have reporters beating down their door over product delays or have an expectation to put out press releases to quell rumors (unless you're Create Originals and a conspiracy theory spreads like wildfire). The aggressive blading industry is a pretty fly-by-the-seat-of-its-pants industry. Communication is not a strong suit for a lot of companies.  tl;dr Just some speculation. Nobody really knows."

rollerblading,3d1ssk,bl8alex,4,Sun Jul 12 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"What's your budget?  What kind of skating are you into? (e.g. park, street, rails, ledges, cess slides, topsides, negatives, airs, gaps, wheelie-rollie stuff, etc.) What do you like about your Remz? What don't you like about your Remz?   The carbons are great skates, really solid and stable, but a little more expensive. Some people actually prefer the carbon free (same boot without the carbon fiber), probably because there's a bit more flex to the boot. Razors will be the closest feel to the Remz if that's what you're after. Valo seems a bit polarizing: some people hate them and others love them to a sort of cultish degree."
rollerblading,3d1ssk,selfoner,2,Mon Jul 13 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"Well i mostly street and park also mini ramp from time to time,do mostly topside and a lot of switches,got some negative hits too,no cess.  I like my remz cuz they are solid have fast and smooth plates they are very soft makes tops and switches easier but they get a litle bit sloppy and the performance on the ramp is not very good with all this said i think i'm going for razors :D"
rollerblading,3d1ssk,selfoner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:55:14 2015 UTC,"Razors are a good choice I think. They'll feel similar to Remz, but a bit less flexy, and won't get nearly as floppy over time."

rollerblading,3czm6h,selfoner,3,Sun Jul 12 15:38:09 2015 UTC,"$200 for a complete big-wheel setup is a pretty aggressive budget, but if you want to cruise around, you kind of need the big wheels IMO. Even Cults with Bigs looks like it'll run you ~$230, but RW might cut you a deal over the phone."
rollerblading,3czm6h,NewYorkCityGent,2,Tue Jul 14 22:05:09 2015 UTC,"I also want to mention, I'm not opposed to going with smaller, 60mm wheels, for a pure aggressive skate as long as they roll well on casual cruising just for exercise."
rollerblading,3czm6h,vaderprime923,2,Sun Jul 12 06:12:15 2015 UTC,"In that case, you might consider going with higher-end bearings. Ceramics or Swiss bearings cost a little more, but the difference is worth it for ease of building and maintaining speed. They will also last a lot longer, so the cost sort of evens out quite a bit when you consider all the cheap bearings you'll need to replace over time."
rollerblading,3czm6h,xuot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:44:48 2015 UTC,"If cost is a factor for OP, he should replace cheap generic ABEC 3's before he spends for ceramics. Ceramics are 5x the cost, it's not worth it IMHO if cost is a big factor"
rollerblading,3czm6h,vaderprime923,2,Wed Jul 15 02:14:42 2015 UTC,I had the same thought and I went ahead and bought the bigs and after about 3 or 4 sessions I longed for an anti set up so I took the plunge on the FTL3's and haven't looked back. I think you'll be better off with that and riding flat with 58-60 mm wheels on a regular aggressive frame and that way you can just swap the inner wheels out whenever you want to grind easy. Hope this helps your decision.
rollerblading,3czm6h,vaderprime923,3,Sun Jul 12 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"I had thought about riding flat with 55-60mm. Is that a pretty smooth ride still?     When you say FLT3 you mean the GC Feather Light 3?   If I go flat, with all 55-60mm,  that opens up a lot more options under $200 and I wouldn't know what to get.   I had looked at the K2 Fattys and Varsity but I want to make sure I get something decent.    Thanks for your help."
rollerblading,3czm6h,vaderprime923,4,Sun Jul 12 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"58mm worked fine for me, it' a smooth enough ride to commute almost 3 miles to work on them although bigger wheels would be better but I don't even find an anti rocker setup that bad, bit slower but still perfectly usable."
rollerblading,3czpdv,ChrisTheGuy,3,Sun Jul 12 06:26:41 2015 UTC,"i cant test those and the brands available in my area are very different (Brazil), but i can say that if you are a beginner, you should (if possible):   try before buying, possibility putting them on your feet inside the store (be careful to not fall too of course) stating the obvious, uncomfortable skates are a bad deal. (and since ppl feet are different from person to person, you have to try it yourself) skates with higher cuffs (the part that locks above your ankle) are easier to use, lower cuffs are useful for slalom and some speed skating technique. (short: the taller the better)   the rest would be applicable to more experienced scenarios, like quality of the wheels, bearings, if the skate does include the correct axle screw to remove the rubber brake afterwards, etcetera..."
rollerblading,3czpdv,aruametello,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"Is it possible on some sites to mail in skates that don't work for me? That way I don't have to settle on one pair that might really work.  I remember as a kid using cheap $50 for walmart, and getting nasty blisters all the time, no matter the size/what type of sock/etc. So comfort is definitely a big deal especially for me. Another point is the higher cuffs as you had mentioned, Those skates tended to flop around and twist my ankle, so I know what you're saying about the higher cuffs."
rollerblading,3czpdv,FRGL1,3,Mon Jul 13 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"When buying, the most important thing is the fit. You want it to be tight when you first put it on so that after you've worn it in, it's still firm and snug. But you also don't want it to be so tight your feet change color or cramp up after 5 minutes of riding.  K2s are affordable and more comfortable than hard shell boots, so they're usually good first skates if you're still learning. However, they're using more traditional parts and these are less interchangeable with other brands if you want to change your riding experience.  Some tips:   Socks can make a difference. Cheap socks don't support your foot, ventilate poorly, and can rub your skin raw. Stock wheels are usually lower quality than aftermarket wheels. The 80A hardness the Fit 80s come with is standard, but on the softer end. They're ideal for indoor riding and smooth outdoor surfaces, but won't stand up to rougher asphalt. Soft boots have shorter lifespans than hard shells. They are harder to wash/clean vs a hard shell skate with a removeable liner. Soft boots (like the K2 Fit) offer less support for your ankle. If you're going to be doing power stops, you risk twisting your ankle (it's still possible if you've trained yourself). K2 skates come with a composite frame that is okay for recreational riding, but will distort, bend, and possibly crack under pressure. Aluminum frames are stronger, but more expensive (and will still bend under extreme pressure). You cannot buy an aftermarket aluminum frame and mount it on a K2 FIT 80 (unless it is made specifically for K2).   If you plan to make skating a big part of your life (I ride daily as it's my means of commute + fun) then you want to invest money in a hard shell boot with a removeable liner. You'll also want that aluminum frame I mentioned, something that uses one-piece axles vs the older two-piece axles.  Falling is inevitable, and the more you grow as a skater the more extreme forces you will exert on your skates. Hard shell boots will prevent twisted ankles and bruised feet when you fall, and those + aluminum frames will stand up to the stress you put on them as a result of increasing skill.  With all of that in mind, my personal recommendation are SEBA's Free Ride skates, which can be bought from a handful of online retailers. I personally recommend ProSkater's Place, as they are eager to price match and have irregular but favorable sales deals + free shipping to US on orders over $100.   They are competitively priced against Rollerblade's Twister. You have three variants of the same skate: FRX (budget), FR2 (compromise), and FR1 (high end). SEBA Skates have frame mounting points that are more compatible with aftermarket frames than Rollerblade's Twister. Their stock liners are extremely comfortable, and if they just don't do it for you, they can be switched with a deluxe liner or a moldable liner. Depending on the size of the shell you buy, you can change the liner to change the size up or down. The FR does NOT come with a brake. Some SEBA products do, but not the FR. You can buy a brake if you're willing to spend the extra money.   Reasons I suggest SEBA's FR are the amount of options you have when customizing it. Stock, they are high end recreational skates that can be used in or outdoors. But if, a year from now, you want bigger wheels, you can just buy any bigger frame (and the wheels) and mount it.  If, a year from now, you want to get into a hybrid discipline like freestyle or powerblading, you can do that. If you have family/friend who are just a size off, you can change the liner to fit their feet. Same boot, new skate."

When I found this subreddit it was after more than a decade of having not skated, and even then those were SUPER cheap skates. Seeing all the brands just made me kind of nervous, since I don't know the differences between them.  Im checking out ProSkater's place, and will keep your suggestion in mind!  How important do you think brakes are? I never used them as a kid, and my friends say they don't use them now. I imagine with the way they're used that they could even be dangerous, but that might just be me misunderstanding how they are used."
rollerblading,3czpdv,FRGL1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"How important do you think brakes are?   Depends of your rolling districts. If you have hills and/or narrow paths I'd incite you to use brakes unless you have solid +1 year of experience. I've ridden 3-4 years and I think I'm ready to take my brakes off. 99% of the cases you are fine with a T-braking, slaloming or powerslide, but if you find yourself with a speed in a narrow downhill and there are 2 people walking a dog, someone is going to die.  I seriously recommend brakes, but just avoiding to using them only for emergency situations. I have skated these years with brakes and only now I feel that I can take them off. I've really needed to practise planning my actions and many breaking techniques so I don't have to ever use the tail brake. Without good skills it's super dangerous to get on a narrow downhill without brakes. You have no room to slalom and you will gain unstoppable speeds in couple of seconds."
rollerblading,3cyo59,sprinkles123,4,Sat Jul 11 23:49:09 2015 UTC,Come in at a tiny angle and just try to slide a few inches. Work your way up to a sharper and sharper angle. Or if that's too much at first do your stall and just try to step or push one of your feet to slide it a bit. Good luck!

Then move to jumping on, then slow rolling up and jumping on. Then just get comfy and start coming with more speed and slide it! The more comfortable you are with the position of your feet, the easier it is to me."
rollerblading,3cyo59,polskimoose,2,Sun Jul 12 04:12:27 2015 UTC,"Bend your knees! The idea being that you lower your center of gravity and it's easier to balance and adjust to the slide. Your legs are the shock absorbers of your body.   Brian Aragon is one of the best at that. 1:53 being a prime example. His movements look so smooth because his legs are bending, absorbing the impacts and balancing. Strong knees, man."

rollerblading,3cyo59,rpRj,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:34:20 2015 UTC,"Bend them knees and get low, like everyone said. The other critical bit they're missing is to get wiiiiiide. Spread your feet a bit more. Be conscious of where both of them are. If you go putting them straight under and in front of you, you will fall backwards."

rollerblading,3cxqfb,kesuaus,2,Sat Jul 11 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"You guys are lucky, when I started up again about a year ago after a decade out It was literally like starting from scratch. I had only skated for little under 2 years originally, but when I started again I could skate forwards on flat ground, roll backwards slightly, and do a t-stop at low speeds. Although how much of that I can blame on putting on over 8 stone of weight and losing my ACL muscle I dunno...  Good on you for getting back into it though."
rollerblading,3cxqfb,Vulgar_Slaughter,2,Sat Jul 11 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"When you train your muscles through repetitive activation, your muscles grow, creating cell nuclei that last long after any detraining.  When retraining, those nuclei are still there, and quickly build new proteins to strengthen your muscle again."
rollerblading,3cxqfb,FRGL1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:20:12 2015 UTC,"Im on the same boat, 15 years for me. Its amazing how it all came back like it was yesterday.  As for the health aspect, if Im not mistaken its pretty damm near running except it is low impact on your joint. It will work your leg/butt muscles but since its cardio you should lose fat all over. Its also good for abs.  Cant really help you with the models as Im fairly new myself. If you get a 2014 pair you can save a lot of money for almost the exact same skates."
rollerblading,3cxqfb,five_magics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:37:59 2015 UTC,yeah but the speed at which it came back... it's incredible :D have long have you been skating?
rollerblading,3cxqfb,five_magics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:40:56 2015 UTC,"Just like you I used to skate as a kid. I didnt do it all that often, but it all came back after a short session in a parking. Was ready to hit the streets,now Ive had 7 sessions which consist of a 4km ride, except last one today I stretched to 5km.  Im loving it more every session."
rollerblading,3cxqfb,five_magics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"Nice! I just hit the streets right away, although our streets are shitty so that's what makes it a tad harder for me. Don't know exactly how many KM I have made, I just went outside of the city to a close village, had a beer and returned so something like 10km's. Will bigger wheels or faster bearings help me on those rocky pavements/roads?"
rollerblading,3cxqfb,five_magics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"I think bigger wheels will make the ride more comfy, but youll have less maneuvrability(sp?). As for bearings I dont know really.  Oh and roads are shitty here aswell (winter really fuck things up here inL Canada). I do little streets as theres a cycling path about 2 minutes away, but even then its 10 meters of super soft surface, followed by 10 meters of super rough, etc.  Edit: about the distance, I suggest you get yourself the Sports Tracker app. Its a really sweet app that tracks you and gives you neat info such as your avg speed, max speed, lap times, altitude vs speed, energy spent, etc etc. And its not only for skating.  As an ex-smoker, it helps me track my progress aswell which is pretty motivating too."

rollerblading,3crg2i,UncleCarnage,5,Fri Jul 10 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"Twister Pros! You have good taste. :D  Lower back pain is indicative you arent bending your knees enough. As Bill Stoppard says, remembr to always STAY LOW. Crossover on your first day is great! Jesus, it took me a year to get there, but some people learn faster than others!   I have a friend who was pretty much in your same situation, day one he was doing crossovers and even starting on backwards skating, but very shaky on stopping. Becasue you have the Pros, they dont come with a heel break, so finding ways to reduce speed and stopping is your number one priority.   Work on drawing S-lines with both skates, like slalom, meandering from side to side, and also practise lemons - both these things while in motion will help greatly reduce speed. MY advice for T-breaking is learn to one-foot skate, it will give you more balance on one leg, allowing you to better let your other foot drag into a T-stop.  Unless you are confident enough to ensure you stop yourself from accellerating too much, be careful with downhill slopes. Worst case scenario, work your way down by carving curves side to side.  Enjoy!"
rollerblading,3crg2i,DranDran,3,Fri Jul 10 09:15:04 2015 UTC,"I'm getting pretty addicted too. Used to skate when I was younger but that was like 15 years ago. Also I'm an ex-smoker who have been pretty unactive for a good 10 years.  I went into an empty school&gym parking (huge parking) on a saturday, and surprisingly it all came back like it was yesterday. Went 5 times so far, 4km rides. First two rides were kinda hard, it was 30 degrees outside and I needed a 10 min break half-way (ex-smoker, shitty cardio). Last three were much better, I can do it in 20 minutes instead of 30 minutes, and I only need a 4-5 min break.  As far as braking goes, I already knew how to stop in a pivot, but I still use my heelbrake to regulate my speed, for example just before stopping with a pivot or when going downhill. Tonight I tried T-stops at moderate speed, and I'm getting the hang of it. Just practice and it'll come fast enough. I'm getting there and I haven't skated in 15 years, and even back then I wasn't all that great.  It's not funny, I just came out of the shower after my ride and I wanna go back out. Can't wait for tomorrow :P.  Edit: Oh and I find skateboard to be much harder then inline skating, but maybe it's because I learned skating when I was a kid."
rollerblading,3crg2i,five_magics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"True, I always felt like skateboarding is the kinda thing you need as a kid/teenager. Learning how to skate properly at 20+ seema almost impossible.  Longboarding on the other hand is really beginner friendly, because of the lenght and the way the board is build."
rollerblading,3crg2i,five_magics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:52:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I always had trouble with both feets on the same board, standing sideways and having both feet nearly perpandicular when kicking to speed up.  Thats why I love inline skating... its like I am walking and gliding over the ground. It feels more natural and almost like walking really.  Its not sideways, its all in front of me and I can react accordingly."
rollerblading,3crg2i,FRGL1,2,Sat Jul 11 04:39:57 2015 UTC,"Are you me? A year in the past?  This is literally how I started skating, except on some grossly undersized kid's bauer skates that I hadn't used since middle school.  Went out to the parking lot behind my house at 1am and toddled around awkwardly for a few hours. After I popped the shell (yes, it popped because my feet were too big), I got my 2013 Twisters. I rock Sebas now, but man, this post was a nostalgia trip.  As Dran mentioned, stay low. Bill Stoppard is god, and all disciplines can benefit from his wisdom. Your back hurting is your body acclimating. It took me 2 months to fully adapt to the rigors of skating. Even with your knees bent your back is going to hurt for a while. Keep at it, and when it starts hurting less, carry something light in a backpack so it keeps hurting and your body develops even faster.  I figured out crossovers in my 2nd month, but everything sort of came together at the same time. I learned how to crossover, drag stop, and turn stop in the same week."
rollerblading,3crg2i,FRGL1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"hahah, man that's crazy :D  I think it's just the muscles that are sore. I try to keep a light arch in the back. Like, when you deadlift or pick heavy shit up from the floor. I stopped going to the gym, because lifting feels kinda boring, but I have benefited a lot from learning good deadlifting posture.  I try to keep my knees touching the tongue most of the time. Plus I gotta work on my balance, because it feels like my left leg isn't performing as well as my right one. Like, doing cross overs to the right feels a lot easier than doing them to the left. Or breaking with my right foot is much harder than with my left foot, because I have to keep the balance on my left leg. I have no problems doing a T stop with my left leg, but I always try to use my right one so I can get better at it. I definetly don't want an imbalance and being able to break only on one side.   Keep at it, and when it starts hurting less, carry something light in a backpack so it keeps hurting and your body develops even faster.   This is a really good tipp!! Making your backpack heavier every couple weeks can work out your lower back, wich can be extremly beneficial. Thanks, man :)"

rollerblading,3crs3d,Gus-Man,2,Fri Jul 10 06:34:45 2015 UTC,"if you are using a 8 wheel skate (4 per foot), at least you can put the damaged wheel in a center position to reduce the effect.  i would keep all the wheels on both skates, because if you land hard with a foot with 3 on, there will be a massive lack of distribution of the force on the frame holding the wheels, likely bending it. (specially if it is a aluminum one)  -> if you still want to remove a wheel, keep the axle (the screw that hold the wheel) on the position missing the wheel, at least the frame wont bend as bad as it could be.  those wheels are made to be sturdy, polyurethane has a notable elasticity before breaking apart, so i think someone ""touched the mold"" before your wheels got fully dried, creating a ""crack"" inside the rubber. (a thick chunk of polyurethane takes 48h to dry fully)"

Fitness: I'd usually do my cardio skating early in the morning around 4 or 5am, so I always just skated a route of nice side streets and low traffic areas near my old apartment complex so if you're looking for parks or bike trails I can't really help you there.  Slalom: Your best bet is to find an empty parking lot to set up some cones at. There's one by my old apartments at the corner of Maitland Ave and Orienta Ave right off 436 which was always empty on sundays and on the evenings. It had relatively good asphalt plus I never got anyone trying to boot me out when I'd set up cones and play a little music at a reasonable level.  Aggro: There's A LOT of neat stuff tucked away in Altamonte Springs, but most of it is kinda spread apart and you have to hunt things down i.e. spots that aren't quite close enough to just cruise from one to the next. If you've got a car it's no problem though."

rollerblading,3cokaa,inshanealicious,3,Thu Jul 9 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"The Xsjado 1.0 (which aren't available anymore) had a 1-piece cuff and a 3-piece soul plate.  The Xsjado 2.0's feature a 2-piece cuff to allow more flexibility and a 1-piece soul plate, as well as some upgrades in the construction materials.  The Xsjado 1.5's/Avant series combines these two changes, with the 1-piece cuff from the 1.0 and the 1-piece soul plate from the 2.0.  I haven't been able to test them all out, so I can't say which I like better but I'm not a fan of the 1-piece cuff and I'm looking to try the 2-piece.  As far as the pro models go, there is absolutely no difference in the skeletons aside from cosmetic differences.  The differences are in the footwraps, which are all similarly constructed but do have variations of their own.  For example the Chris Farmer footwrap is much different form the Sean Kelso footwrap."
rollerblading,3cokaa,russharv9,2,Thu Jul 9 15:22:44 2015 UTC,"As /u/russharv9 pointed out, the Avant 3 and Werbeski models are ""1.5s"" with the older 1-piece cuff. All the others are the same boot in different colors.  I've skated both, and I prefer the 2.0 cuff. It flexes forward more easily, but I find it to be a little more supportive side to side. The only part of the 1.0 I miss - and I'm not sure if the Avant and Werbeski have this - was the thicker padding on the instep strap. Sooo comfy."
rollerblading,3cokaa,chowaniec,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:52:32 2015 UTC,"As far as standard and pro boots go, it seems to be mostly a difference in color, and the boots with have the frames and wheels the pro rider is sponsored by.    There are two different versions of the boot as well, one with a cuff bolt and a cuff that moves, and one with a 1 piece cuff.    I ride the 1 piece cuffs, and really really like them.  I have skated Salomans, Rollerblade, Razors, and Remz also, and I have to say the Xsjado has been the most comfortable for me by far, except for the Salomans.  The Salomans were my first aggressive skates, and those liners were soooo comfy after two sessions of break in.    EDIT:  I just wanted to emphasize that my claims of comfort are for me personally.  I'm sure there are many here that will champion the comfort of the other brands I mentioned.  Something about the way the Xsjados hold my feet tight and in once place is really comfortable to me."

rollerblading,3cn2or,thisismy20,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:59:30 2015 UTC,Yeah you basically use the analog sticks for all grinds. It's a timing thing. You have to have. The sticks in a certain position to do a certain grind. Sometimes you have to move the left stick first and sometimes the right stick first.   It's very interesting and great fun when you have the controls nailed.
rollerblading,3cn2or,thisismy20,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:55:32 2015 UTC,Man when is that update gonna come out? I haven't been able to play at all due to the bugs on my pre-alpha. I can move the skater around but as soon as he leaves that top platform he falls through the map. Settings are lowest I can get them but it still won't let me play. Watching these edits is all I got for now.
rollerblading,3cn2or,timwoj,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:32:11 2015 UTC,Have you still got the original RAR file in your downloads. Extract it to your desktop and try again. That's been a pretty consistent fix for falling and freezing.
rollerblading,3cn2or,FFevo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:25:50 2015 UTC,I dont have the original RAR but I did get an update copy from the guys at On A Roll and it is playing better. I'm not falling through the map anymore but for some reason the controller mapping is all messed up. I cant find a way to configure the controls aside from changing the controller from PS4 to XBOX.
rollerblading,3cn2or,FFevo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:05:56 2015 UTC,When  the game's launcher opens there are 2 tabs. Graphics and input. Input is where the controls are stored. They are currently not available outside of the game but I really hope the control information moves into it's own xml file or something so it can be edited by those with unique controllers and driver issues.

Because i skate hours every day, its necessary or my skates are just constantly damp with old sweat. Regular (monthly) washing is still necessary, but it kept me from having to wash it every week.   The cool thing about silica gel is that when its saturated with fluid you can bake it dry and reuse it. Try to get the kind that changes color as they saturate.   You can buy 6 sock fulls of silica gel at most hobby stores for about 20-30 usd, but for the best selection go to a shop that specializes in flower preservation."

rollerblading,3cmkmb,frostixdigga,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:50:30 2015 UTC,"Well, if you wanna do it free, yeah. If you skate 2-3 times a week, 10 shoe packets (5 each) will get you by for a month or so until they get saturated. If you're using prepackaged silica gel, don't put them in the socks, just drop them in your liners.  If you need silica gel to actively dry out moist liners, you need an entire sockful of gel.  Don't use old packets (like if you bought the shoes a month ago). They'll be saturated. You can tear them open and collect them until you have enough to bake a batch. Mind you, I just went out and bought 3 lbs of gel from my hobby store."

I ordered a size too big, put up with it for a long time, but I'm thinking I should just get ones that are properly sized.  Some notes   Wheels are kinda shit at this point. I'm on the heavier side and have been doing a lot of practice on stopping techniques, and it's really eaten through the wheels. These come with the original and unused white color kit for the cuff and everything. I'm keeping the green ones. Unless you really want them too. I might have a heel brake for these somewhere still. Don't tell anyone. If interested, and I can find it, it's yours.   Otherwise everything works as expected and there's nothing broken or missing.

rollerblading,3cgmps,TuPP3,2,Tue Jul 7 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"i use a 120mm 3 wheels high cuff setup setup most of the time potato quality photo  out of experience (i currently have 72mm, 100mm and 120mm setups) i can say that for ""leisure rides"" focusing more on total distance, the bigger the better.  i will try to put a ""decent review"" of a overall experience bellow:  ""what can you expect from something similar to the powerslide imperial cruiser""   worse performance on very tight turns: (aka its not for slalom)    its not exactly a ""loss of maneuverability"" but sure there is a difference, overall i think is the feel that it is harder to ""lean for a tight turn"" on a very slow speed. (you aren't as close to the ground as you where before)   wheels more sensible to the ""core debonding effect"": (squeaky wheels)   some wheels not intended for jumps can acquire a annoying ""squeaky"" noise if you DO land hard of them (not absorbing the impact with your legs). That is when the plastic hub detaches from the polyurethane rubber of the wheel, allowing a tiny friction motion between them when you apply pressure deforming the rubber of the wheel. (wheels that are mostly rubber are mostly free from this effect, wheels that are mostly empty space and plastic in the hub may develop this on the first day)   wheels are more expensive in general: (may not be a problem)   the short version is: you will pay more for the same amount of rubber, even considering you ""may"" have more rubber to spent on each set of wheels.   - you may be able to find cheap scooter wheels at those sizes.   higher top speed, slower starts:   think on riding a bike with a higher gear ratio, there is a more pronounced ""lever effect"" when you push on each stride, worse for slow speeds but better for higher speeds. The initial push is not a problem at all unless you intent to play street hockey on those.   Sliding:   on the sliding part, and mostly debunking a myth, there is little to no problem to do those on big wheels (120 is almost as big as it can get), the difference is that you MUST have high cuffs for that, and the tension applied to the cuffs and frames will be pretty intense. I regularly use powerslide/parallel slide for braking without problems. - yes, there is a loss of grip with less wheels, if that is desirable or not its up to you. (but it is pretty bad on wet surfaces)   big wheels are better for rough surfaces:   AH YEAH, if you have to carefully plan your routes trough the city to use the surfaces that are ""plain enough"", you will see the difference right away. (the asphalt and sidewalks here suck a lot) but... we are talking about ""maybe 50% bigger diameter"", not 200%, therefore you could expect a 50% better performance, not 200%. (i see some people exaggerating this effect on forums)  edit: formating, typos and stuff"
rollerblading,3cgmps,aruametello,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the information! This Reddit seems pretty amazing place.  I think the attributes you listed are a deal-breaker for me. I like more tight turns than higher speeds. I really like the speed and maneuverability of my 84mm 4-wheelers.  I think there's market for freeskating 3-wheelers, but that's more for the ones that skate, let's say 80% fitness and 20% stunts. I'd say that I do 50/50. I also read that landing jumps on 3-wheelers is more difficult, but I cannot find the source anymore.  I'd love to try those 3-wheeler freeskates, but I'm not going to gamble 300€ on Megacruisers when I can get 4-wheel FSK skates for under 200€.  Megacruisers are the only one 3-wheelers that Powerslide lists on their FSK category, everything else is 4-wheelers: http://www.powerslide.com/en/products/inline-skates#cat-3"
rollerblading,3cgmps,NEVERDOUBTED,2,Tue Jul 7 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"I have never skated 3 wheel before.   What I can offer is the obvious. If you have less wheels, you have less grip unless you make the wheel taller. If you make the wheel taller in order to make up for the number of wheels, then you, as a person skating, will be higher.   Now that may not be an issue, and we can certainly have a talk about grip and wheel compounds and...perhaps we all have too much grip anyways.   And of course, larger wheels mean that they deal better with rocks and cracks and such.   So...give and take. I can't see how 3 would be an issue.   By the way, I have run 4 wheel systems before where the two inner wheels are slightly larger than the outers. This creates a skate that is super easy to turn, but you lose that knife-edge when all four wheels are evenly on the ground. Great for tricks and such, and great for rolling small bumps, but not great for taking corners super fast."
rollerblading,3cgmps,Warkid1993,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:00:50 2015 UTC,how does taller equate to more grip ?
rollerblading,3cgmps,NEVERDOUBTED,2,Tue Jul 7 22:36:36 2015 UTC,"A ""contact patch"" is the area or footprint that the wheel makes to the ground.   If you could imagine covering your wheel in ink, and then pressing down on a flat surface, (wheel not turning) that stamping of ink would be the contact path.   The contact patch is measured as an area. If it were perfectly square or rectangle, then the area would height x width. In the case of the blade wheel, the contact patch is oval shape, so a bit more math would be involved.   In either case, the taller the wheel, the greater the diameter and the greater the circumference. And this means, a longer contact patch, which means a greater amount of area.   Now...it's not much of a measurable difference. I mean...if you did a side-by-side comparison and look at one verses the other, (short wheel vs tall wheel) you might be inclined to say that the patch of the taller wheel is just barely larger. However, just a little bit more or less of contact patch can make all the difference between slipping and not slipping, because there is a force-pressure-area equation that would show a radical increase is the ability for the wheel to offer more friction even when there is just a small change in area of the patch.   Here's a wiki article on car tires...so not perfect...but it covers some similarities.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_patch  Overall, what you have to do is look at the contact patch for all the tires on one skate, and then compare that to the contact patch on a different skate.   The question would then come up, do three tall wheels offer more, less, or the same overall contact area that four smaller wheels do? And I don't know the answer to that question.   There's also the matter of how a contact patch is loaded...which raises or lowers it's ability to stick, but that's a different subject.   On my skates, the two rear wheels are taller than the two fronts. This has some merit to it because in general we load the heel more than the toe, so...on paper it's a cool idea. Seems to work for me as well."

If you check earlier and know where to go and what obstacles are on the way it's pretty good. Sometimes skating can be faster than public transport ;)  also the big help for me is fact that people from my city did an awesome project, skating map of Warsaw, it's updated reeeally often. It's awesome if you want to check for the kind of surface on any street and the most popular parks are also marked here. So, in conclusion: yes, skating is a good alternative for going places."

Skating is just so much more efficient and faster, not to mention fun, and the advantage over bikes is you can go wherever you like, not just limited to bike paths.  The only issue is getting into shops and stores, many wont allow it with your skates on. Its summertime fo carry some flip flops with you and slip into them once you get to your destination."

I just carry a pair of trainers for when I get where I'm going and if it starts raining I can just get on a bus instead of having to continue riding in the rain, for getting around London I find skating simpler than cycling."

rollerblading,3c9yrb,YoullNever_WalkAlone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yup. I spent half my life cycling. I got bored of it after so long. I wear my skates more than my shoes.  The only thing I miss is the speed. The effort it takes me go at what I call a cruising speed on my bike is a lot less than what it takes for me to sprint on my skates. Where I live, most cyclists are the skinsuit types with light road bikes that I have no hope of keeping up with (I was a mountain biker).  Still, it's definitely satisfying when I can just hop onto the curb to avoid a motorist who doesn't know how to parallel park and then drop back onto asphalt a second later. Hanging out with my other rolling friends, it's pretty fun to be envied at not having to get off my bike or step off my board to do things."
rollerblading,3c9yrb,FRGL1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:51:23 2015 UTC,Back when I used to use 60mm wheels and antirockers I would only use my skates at the park. But since moving up to bigger wheels and more of them I'll roll everywhere on them. The rough asphalt isnt an issue anymore and I can still feel my toes an hour of solid skating on rough surfaces. Where as with the small wheels 5minutes was enough.

I'd imagine you'd have more luck looking for someone who's into rollerblading in Providence then finding someone who's in Providence out of everyone who's into rollerblading. I think OP would have more luck addressing with the most specific stipulation first, which is finding people to rollerblade with and places to rollerblade in the smallest state in the country. People post about finding hobby communities in /r/RhodeIsland constantly - in fact, right now there the #3 post on the front page is a guy looking for and finding a group to play D&D with.

rollerblading,3c7y51,Terkis,3,Sun Jul 5 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd take the risk on the unspecified frames.   If you go for the full set up you might as well buy replacement wheels straight away. They're razors ""3-D"" stock wheels which are known to wear very quickly and occasionally chunk badly (even as soon as the first session, as shown by a post on here just a few days ago)."

rollerblading,3c7y51,FRGL1,2,Sun Jul 5 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"Chunking, in its more literal meaning, is where a chunk of your wheel just comes out. Rough road, poor wheel composition, and it just comes out in a big chunk.  Your definition of ""good"" for any skating equipment should generally be ""does what it's supposed to do"", ""doesn't have any glaring design flaws"", and ""has a decent warranty policy"". When you're going for a holiday special, an h-block is an h-block, and a good h-block is one that doesn't smash your head into the ground when you try to grind a rail, or crack after a week when you least expect it while trying to grind down 3 stories of a spiral stairwell.

When I was 9 I had surgery on my heel, basically they removed 1/2 of my heel. The way it healed is that it just swelled sideways. So I pretty much have a heel that is wide as fuck and my foot is a size and a half smaller than my other one.   So I play tons of hockey in the winter (shinny) and in the summer I mostly aggressive skate but also like to play roller hokey time to time. With my fucked up foot I find it hard to buy proper shoes. my Right foot is around 8.5-9 and my left is a 7-7.5. Right now for aggressive skating I am very comfortable in Seba FX 7.5. I also have a pair of size 9 Seba FR's (I use these to skate around town when my bike is in the shop, and to play hockey in) that are a bit too big, but don't give me any pain in my left foot.   So my best advice is to deal with the pain breaking them in, or get a size up. Most skates will pack out sideways but its the time and pain it takes that make it hard.  Good luck bud."

The first spin and the stupid 540 you see me do is actually a glitch involving spins to the left while holding LB, I just didn't want to redo the line again and figured it was worth keeping anyway haha (I had to redo a lot of lines due to weird visual bugs and glitches)  And yea, as of right now this game is in a pre-alpha state, the animations are really rough and there's practically no real transitional animations.

rollerblading,3c21pi,GAMEXII2012,3,Sat Jul 4 01:06:47 2015 UTC,I hear a lot of good things about twisters
rollerblading,3c21pi,HighRelevancy,2,Sat Jul 4 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"My first pair was the 2013 T80s. They're great multi-purpose recs with solid ventilation for a hard shell boot. I had a bad experience with the stock axles: One of them was overtightened and fused with the frame. Even after boring it out it stayed there and I had to replace my frames under manufacturer warranty. Buy different axles as soon as possible.  Try to get the previous year's model, cause it's cheaper. Rollerblade's stock wheels don't wear well past your third rotation. Once you've flattened them you won't want to buy more. Do you have a solution for replacing wheels? I know a canadian store that ships 40 wheels for $280 (1 wheel = $7). Free shipping on orders over $100.  EDIT: For question 2, my personal Bible is: [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyMNJ0n18Q8 [2] No heel brake. Ever. It'll just get in the way. [3] Walk on the grass a lot. Helps break in new skates, shows you how they behave. [4] Master beginner level slalom. It will help you do things like Parallel turns, T (drag) stops, turn stops, and eventually powerslides (abrupt stops).

rollerblading,3c160c,xavplusplus2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:33:29 2015 UTC,I read the buyer's guide and am still having issues I know I need aggressive skates but picking them out is going to be difficult
rollerblading,3c160c,sonicadept,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:45:07 2015 UTC,"For going fast you will want a bigger wheel setup, maybe those 5 wheel longer frames. Ger a boot that fits you nicely, and ( my advice ) get something like kizer advance ( 1,2 or 3 ), bake frames. If you are not so inclined to bomb hills get whatever frame looks best, if you dont ride them i cant say which will be for you. Kaltiks, ground control, kizer, etc.  Usd, razors, xsjado, valo, remz... all good skates, you cant go wrong on getting some of them to learn to blade...  You can actually bomb hills with aggro wheels, but, going on a rough road down fast with 55mm wheels will make your all your teeth fall out from the rattle and vibrations."
rollerblading,3c160c,sonicadept,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:35:17 2015 UTC,I found this set and have decided that for now I want aggressive so I can work on grinding and jumping off of shit haha http://www.aggressivemall.com/Valo-TV-3-Winter-Warrior-Skate-Pack-p/valo-skate-pack-ww.htm  but these are way cheaper http://www.inlinewarehouse.com/USD_Sway_Team_Aggressive_Inline_Skates/descpage-710099.html
rollerblading,3c160c,sonicadept,2,Fri Jul 3 23:06:46 2015 UTC,"Both are good. Valos are bit more, but sways are not any worse because they are cheaper. I might get myself a pair of them, but i still cant decide.   As with longboarding ( or skateboarding ) there are tons of options on how you set up your skates. That all is going to get clearer as you ride them. Dont over tighten your cuff, two fingers of free space in front of your shin is what you should aim for, work on your ankle strenght for balance, dont cheat by tightening your cuff ;)  As for grinds, start on something thats higher than your knees ( and pardon my english ). It is safer to have to jump some more and if you miss you end sitting on your butt on a box, instead of going to grind a curb - may look easy but if you miss that there is a nice chance that you will smash your head.   For me it was a lot easier to practice grinds on something that i had to jump high and be in almost crouching position when i hit the coping, when i miss i usualy just sit on the box i used to practice on. I was lucky i was wearing a helmet first time i tried backside savannah on a curb. It was like some ninja from mortal kombat swept my feet and i fell like a plank, hitting my face and head. I hope you get what im trying to say here :)"
rollerblading,3c160c,sonicadept,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:28:25 2015 UTC,I do! I wear a helmet now anyways cuz I totally ate pavement yesterday and my thumb is purple lol. But can I grind with sways?
rollerblading,3c160c,sonicadept,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:10:04 2015 UTC,Why not? You could grind with hockey blades if you were so inclined...

rollerblading,3bwloo,UncleCarnage,2,Thu Jul 2 19:20:03 2015 UTC,"I modded some old hockey skates, but it took a bit of work. The wheels are the main weak point, as stock hockey wheels are made for smooth blacktop and rip apart really easily on roads. Unfortunately they were also stolen a few weeks ago so I must have done a decent job of disguising them as something more expensive."
rollerblading,3bwloo,NPC82,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:21:06 2015 UTC,"oh man, that sucks. Who steals rollerblades?!  You can always use some outdoor wheels"
rollerblading,3bwloo,FRGL1,2,Thu Jul 2 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"Rollerblade's Twister is just a high cost multipurpose recreational skate. The hard shell protects you during falls better and the ventilation and heel cushion is nice, but for an unspecialized skate it's a little pricey.  SEBA's FR series is specialized towards freeskating. It's basically a Twister with a more solid shell, better articulation, and a competitive pricepoint, minus the ventilation. SEBA also offers better options for the freeskate/slalom market. The abrasive pad on the sides of the boots can be replaced with a soul plate for grinding, which is an option you don't get on Twisters. That's why I consider Twisters recs and not Freeskates.  While I don't know a whole lot about Hockey skates, they usually have smaller, softer wheels that aren't suited for outdoor use. They generally lack a plastic cuff because hockey players want the ankle flexion for carving, and additional hockey padding makes up for the exposure.  Source on Twister and FR1 is me owning and riding both of them."
rollerblading,3bwloo,Vandebe,2,Fri Jul 3 05:39:53 2015 UTC,"Use whatever skate you are comfortable with. Personally I would avoid the twister because the forefoot on the boot flexes really bad for me, but that could be a product of me being husky and really aggressive when I stride. I had the maxxum 90's which uses the same boot with a different cuff. The boot might work perfectly well with 80mm wheels, but I'm gunshy about buying them again. I also am 99% sure I'm going back to 80mm for big wheels as my ankles are weak from not using my 90's"
rollerblading,3bwloo,Vandebe,2,Fri Jul 3 09:32:45 2015 UTC,"damn, I was thinking about getting the Twister Pro. The FR1 I had ordered felt too big and looked huge. Going one size down would still have the same shell size and the skate would end up looking still huge."
rollerblading,3bwloo,FRGL1,3,Fri Jul 3 09:37:56 2015 UTC,"The twister might be better because of the thicker (I assume) liners and the stronger cuff. Try them out. Get hydrogen wheels, they are baller as fuck"
rollerblading,3bw4d4,kingofeggsandwiches,2,Thu Jul 2 17:11:12 2015 UTC,Whoa. Yeah that's not supposed to happen. I've never even seen a break this bad before.
rollerblading,3bw4d4,tubz,2,Thu Jul 2 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"That's probably the worst case of chunking I've ever seen. You should definitely get in touch with the manufacturer, I wouldn't expect that on the first sessions of even the cheapest stock wheels."
rollerblading,3bw4d4,Vulgar_Slaughter,2,Thu Jul 2 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, will do, I'll contact the retailers first and failing that the manufacturer. Here's some more pics of the damage. Also here's what one of the other wheels looks like after just 45 minutes skating in a concrete park. They are USD stock wheels and just say ""USD 57/90"" on them."
rollerblading,3bw4d4,salmonnerd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:39:38 2015 UTC,That's the problem right there. I don't trust many other brands outside of Eulogy
rollerblading,3bw4d4,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"The generic wheels out there are mostly shit.

Hands down the worst wheels I've ever skated since the Senate liberty core wheels. If I had paid any amount of money for them I would have been pissed.

rollerblading,3bvlt6,andreas542,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:29:22 2015 UTC,"If you want to get some more room from shells, you can always stretch them out a bit. I do it with my Classic Throne and UFS Throne shells. It allows me to skate an EU40 skate with an EU41 liner. If I really want room I'll remove everything from the shell (cuff, soulplates, laces... everything) and put them in the oven at 90 celsius for 15 minutes. I then take them out and put something big in them, like my d... like a big beer glass or something. Leave them to cool for 45 mins and they should be much roomier.

Otherwise, if you want to skate a strap in blade, you will probably be happy.  Speaking only from my own experience I would look into the sevens, or better yet, those valos. The Valos are a solid design, They're actually the Roces m12's with a skin and new soul frame. But the Razors Cult is a lot cheaper than Valo's boots and just as good."

I've never been much of a gamer, Halo is the only series I ever played on a regular basis and my xbox 360 has pretty much been a really expensive netflix machine for a few years now so I'm probably not the kind of person you want a reply from, but if it involves rollerblading I could see myself enjoying realism or complete fantasy settings.  It would be more important to me that they were well done. A fictional/unrealistic environment would have to have a compelling story to keep me engaged though.   Realism, heck, just drop me in a sandbox and let me go skating when my body is too sore to actually do it! Which is what On A Roll seems to be."

rollerblading,3bn47e,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"There's 1/2 of two pairs in that picture. I thought you said you had three? It's my fault for not being more specific, sorry man, could you take a few more pictures?  This is exactly what we'd need to give you an idea of what they're worth although /u/aldolega gave you a pretty realistic estimate sight unseen:   1 picture of the soul side of each skate facing the camera (outside of the boot like in the picture you just posted but with the entire skate in the shot) 1 with the negative of each skate (inside of the boot) facing the camera. Finally one of each skate with the bottom of the soul-frames facing the camera. So assuming you do have 3 pairs, you'd be taking 9 pictures total.    If you list them on Ebay you can reuse those pictures too, because those are the angles most people want to see when they're buying used skates. Actually, a top down shot would be helpful too since it's a soft boot skate and you can't just swap in fresh liners.  Check out the group ""Blade Trade Outpost"" on facebook it's a great group for selling old blader gear. Even if you'd rather do things through ebay, posting the link would probably get some k2 fanboys interested.   What size are they? If they're an 8 I'd be willing to buy the yellows right now if we can agree on a price because I always thought those were neat when I was younger. It'd be a nice addition to my collection and maybe roll around once or twice before retiring them haha."
rollerblading,3bn47e,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu Jul 2 04:50:04 2015 UTC,It is so sad. When I skated almost 20 years ago the sport was blossoming. It was such a fun sport. I am really let down that it died out. I hope it will come back one day.

rollerblading,3bls03,jokingrotten,5,Tue Jun 30 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"an ice skate blade is shaped like a square. so, if you stand the skates straight up (or in reality, angle them sliiightly), you can slide sideways along the ice at very low speeds for a moderate distance.  if you have the bottom half of a square (the blade) resting on a flat surface (the ice), you can move side to side without much resistance. But if you tilt the square, then the edge will dig in more effectively, until you hit ~45 degrees.   whereas with blades, if you try to slide sideways while standing almost straight up.... prepare for disaster."

rollerblading,3blad7,msnlink,3,Tue Jun 30 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"Okay, so after looking closely... Your spacers cost $9.20 for a pack of 8, which is enough for your entire set... That's how much a pack of regular spacers cost, roughly. I don't see the problem with buying those spacers.  So, explaining again... On a standard skate, it is not the spacer's job to flush your wheels against the frame. It is your bearing's job. Specifically, it's the inner race which makes contact with your frame.  If your wheels are sliding from side to side along the axles, then they are too small for your frames. It sounds like you have a lot of proprietary/outdated equipment on those things.  Here's a few photos illustrating a standard skate frame (mine). For insight, keep in mind that I have used Bones Bearings in the past, and they are identical sizes to the ones I'm using right now.  http://imgur.com/lU4o4C3 The ridge you see in the middle of the hub is what keeps the bearings from depressing into your wheel. The spacer is there to smooth things out and prevent your hubs from deformation under extreme stress.  http://imgur.com/FbiFH0m This photo illustrates that on normal skates, the spacer jiggles around loosely between the two bearings. They are not pressed against the inner race of your bearings. You don't see much deviation on mine because they are floating spacers, but if I had ones like you got with your Bones Reds, you would see them lazily rolling around at the bottom of the well.  http://imgur.com/afVqNo0 When the assembled wheels are axled in, the inner race is the part that makes contact with the frame, not the spacer. The spacer is entirely enclosed inside the hub, between the two bearings.  http://imgur.com/FGowyYJ For comparison, here is the length of my axle. It looks like you're using the older two-way axles that require torque from both ends.  This is the anatomy of a normal skate. If yours, properly assembled, does not look like that then they are not using current, modern skate parts."
rollerblading,3blad7,FRGL1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:37:42 2015 UTC,The information you provided about the anatomy of the skate is much appreciated. Gives me a much better idea of what I'm working with here.   Thanks for the information and the advice.
rollerblading,3blad7,FRGL1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:23:34 2015 UTC,"I have since learned that external spacers are colloquially called ""top hats"" in certain circles. They're frequently used with plastic frames. The ones that come with Hypno Skates are shorter than normal.  A potential solution would be to find a regular skate shop that sells top hats and file them down little by little until they fit right. Keep in mind this is only a suggestion. They may be harder to find."
rollerblading,3blad7,FRGL1,0,Wed Jul 1 06:14:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, oh god... External spacers. Is that a thing? The bones you bought came with INTERNAL spacers...  I'm not sure if external spacers are a thing, or not... And you need two per wheel? Why? Even my old plastic 1999 Bauers didn't have those... And those frames were made of plastic.  I don't have anything else to say except that, unless external spacers are a thing, you're forced to buy from Hypnoskate... And also that while in the US ""rollerblading"" is the genericized term for ""inline skating"", by trademark rules you are only ""rollerblading"" if you are wearing ""Rollerblade"" inline skates.  It sounds like North American distribution is ending. Unless you plan on buying standard skates in the near future, I would suggest buying all the spare parts you can afford."

The moderators are located in the United States so we depend on european bladers to recommend shops to us that they've purchased from for inclusion in the buyers guide. As for the price discrepancy, I'm not sure of the reason. I would call Locoskates and ask them directly about it. If they don't price match then don't order from them.  Our buyers guide is not a replacement for due diligence, only a general starting point. Shopping around is always a good idea. Please let us know if you do ask locoskates about this matter.

Be sure that the frame you choose to buy will fit the mounting points on your boot. For example, a SEBA GT frame (90mm) will not fit a Rollerblade Twister 80.  Mind you, they won't be dedicated fitness skates then, because you'll still have a high cuff. There are other ways to step up your skating than increasing wheel size or buying a soul plate, y'know~  Join the slalom side! We have tutus!"

I've just got back into skating after a 12 year gap just as something to do and owing to the fact I now live next door to a skatepark. I know I added the 50/50 frames as I wore through my old ones as a kid. As you can see they're pretty shit up. Am I right in thinking it would be impossible to buy parts for these now, Salomon don't make skates any more right? The boot's ok but the soul plate on the right is worn to fuck (it's virtually all gone and the screw in it are just smooth). Obviously I could buy new frames, wheels and bearing and just go from there but I might as well buy a new skate without the soulplate, which is a shame because I loved these skates, so much so that I kept them for 12 years without using them.    I've also got some really old Razor cults but they're probably equally shit up. Anyone got any recommendation what to replace with and where to buy in Europe?"

rollerblading,3bbgvf,brokenstep,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:28:34 2015 UTC,"Highly recommend both of these skates, but the Friday one would be difficult in aggresive skates (surely possible, but I haven't seen anyone do it)."

rollerblading,3b524g,frostixdigga,3,Fri Jun 26 01:03:55 2015 UTC,"I've been on them for 1.5 years. They are good. Going down. Two sizes good? Idk about that. I wear a true 11, and I can't fit a 9 shell. They are slimmer, but idk if they are what you need. If you wear say a size 10, and the next shell down is a 9, then yes. If you wear a 11, and the next size down is a 9, no. It's not worth my comfort to stuff down a few sizes to try to fit a 9. Basically you have about 1 to 1.5 sizes to play with. This also depends on the skate, but that's my two cents on it."
rollerblading,3b524g,Travis_Stewart,2,Fri Jun 26 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"the thing with seba FR shells, is that they are shared. Only the Liners change, the shells don't always change. For example sizes 43 and 44 are both in a 44 shell and a 45 is in a 45 - 47 shell size. So if I went down only one size, that would be a 43, I would still be in the same shell, since the shell is a 44. So technically, I would be going down 1 ""shell size""  Weird thing is that a EU44 is a US10.5 and going down two sizes is a EU42 but a US 9 and not as US 8.5  The Liner does look thiner and more like a sock, so it kinda seems like it would fit."
rollerblading,3b524g,what_is_this_life,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:02:42 2015 UTC,"Depending on the skate, you might be able to drop up to two sizes. I skate a size 7 skate with size 9-10 feet using the intuition liners, but I'm very willing to cram my feet into the smallest skates possible for added performance. I hated the intuition liners for the first two weeks I skated them, but they pack out really nicely, and once they do they're arguably the best liner available right now. I'd say your probably pretty safe dropping one skate size, but I wouldn't try to drop two unless you're willing to deal with some foot pain and probably modification of the shell of the skate in order to make it fit properly."
rollerblading,3b524g,drount,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"Dropping one size wont be possible because of the shared FR sizes. Sizes 43 and 44 are both in a 44 shell so the next smaller shell size would be at 42. Weird is how in US sizes the sizes are 10.5, then 10 and then 9 meaning I would drop 1.5 sizes in US and 2 in EU, if that makes any sense.  Did you drop 3 or 2 sizes because a 7 is 3 sizes down from 10, which seems really tough to fit in if I think about it.  I don't really how to proceed from here."
rollerblading,3b524g,drount,2,Fri Jun 26 03:17:44 2015 UTC,I have a true 45 and I was able to downsize to 43 - 44 shell. It makes a huge difference.

I was trying to make a THPS style rollerblading game in the 90s as a middle/high school student and teenage developer me thought it was possible.   I quickly learned how hard it was, but learned how to code as a result which is what I am doing now as a startup Founder.  So it's crazy that it took almost 15 years to make one that is as good (hopefully) and will be awesome."
rollerblading,3aztpb,AndrewKemendo,2,Wed Jun 24 22:04:53 2015 UTC,I did something similar - I tried finding mod tools for THPS but they turned out to be rather limited. Apparently you can't do much more than texture map changes.

rollerblading,3atcb2,Yogi_Berra,3,Wed Jun 24 04:51:29 2015 UTC,Verified. AJ will be answering questions from this account.
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,4,Wed Jun 24 21:37:51 2015 UTC,I'm kinda going way back on this one but I always wondered what happened to that clip of Haffey at Monica Lewinsky where he did a fakie 3 over the rail into the bank and then fakie 3ed the other way over the gap. I don't remember seeing it in any of his sections that came out over the next year. And then I quit skating.
rollerblading,3atcb2,rugby_league,4,Wed Jun 24 16:36:27 2015 UTC,I gave it to one of the other projects he was filming for and they didn't use it and I didn't save it.  I'm pretty bad about footage backup.  You should start skating again.
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,5,Thu Jun 25 19:57:30 2015 UTC,"With blading on it's current trajectory, how long do you think you can keep up making products and videos to a diminishing market?"
rollerblading,3atcb2,masterblading,2,Fri Jun 26 23:50:38 2015 UTC,I'm lucky enough that I work hard outside of inline skating to the point where not all of my income needs are based on selling within out community.  If it were I would have had to close up shop after Charging was released as we were broke.

rollerblading,3atcb2,Vandebe,2,Sun Jun 28 18:58:08 2015 UTC,lost my password and I am lazy.  Really sucks because I shouldn't post some of my opinions that I do as 'Vibralux Denim'
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,3,Wed Jul 1 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"I listened to your conversation with King Dirty multiple times, and I throughly enjoyed listening to you two talk. My question, can we be besties? You seem as awesome as a Kate Upton nip-slip.  Also, here's a Bill Burr question for you. If you were locked in a basketball gym with 1000 8 year olds instructed to attack you, how many could you dispatch (via injury or death) before you were overwhelmed?  And, what was your favorite blade product to ever be produced?"
rollerblading,3atcb2,Vandebe,2,Sun Jun 28 12:40:23 2015 UTC,"Of course we can be friends, people will tell you I'm an asshole though because I speak my mind.  Anyone who can get past that fact usually ends up being my friend.   I could dispatch the first 2 kids.  I would grab one by the ankles and swing him/her hard enough at another ones face that they would die many days later of concussion like symptoms related to blunt force trauma.  Favorite blade product ever was the senate money clip and or the senate retractable key ring."

rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,3,Wed Jul 1 23:03:20 2015 UTC,Hey Adam. Do you have any plans to do another full-length video soon? Everyone's been making these short edits lately and they just feel incomplete.
rollerblading,3atcb2,chowaniec,3,Mon Jun 29 15:59:38 2015 UTC,"I will be making some team videos soon.  I hope you don't feel like ours are incomplete.  I feel like they offer a pretty good intro, main body, and end.  Full videos done traveling and done right cost around $15k-25 depending on amount of people involved and how many places you go.  I don't want to do anything half assed and the last 2 videos I made took a year a piece of my life just to lose money.  That's hard to do at 32 with companies that don't have the healthiest of margins on the back end to subsidize the losses."
rollerblading,3atcb2,blckmtlrbtdth,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"the last 2 videos I made took a year a piece of my life just to lose money   Oof. That's rough. Hats off for your dedication. Maybe you could find a way to travel less/cheaper? Capture people in their homes instead of doing a tour? Just spitballing here.   I feel like they offer a pretty good intro, main body, and end   I wasn't talking about the structure so much as the experience. Maybe I'm old-school, but I think a video feels more immersive and special when you have to set some time aside for it. Glad to hear there's some beefier business on the way."
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,3,Wed Jul 1 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"Hi, Adam. First off, thanks for all you have done for rollerblading over the years and thanks for all you continue to do. I have two questions.    The most recent line of Vibralux products features shirts and pants made within the US. While such an approach both reduces carbon footprint and invests in a more local economy, it also seems important to be more involved in the production process as the difficulties of the Create Originals CRS frames point out. Of course, being more involved in production has it positives, but I would imagine it would have many drawbacks too. What have been the issues or challenges for you (and maybe in general) with shifting production in this way, and how do you see your particular strategy in relation to existing issues within the aggressive inline industry (e.g. scale and scope of market)? What is your first memory on rollerblades?"
rollerblading,3atcb2,blckmtlrbtdth,3,Tue Jun 30 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you!   The main drawback is cost.  We have fantastic factories lined up but have failed on the funding.  Now that Don's part is finished I can focus on the reboot of a crowd funding for our first line to be made exclusively in America.  Problem is many people have a sour taste in their mouth about crowd funding because of the CRS issues.  I think we have a solid price point and plan moving forward and I would give anyone my address and invite them over for coffee if they need further convincing in our ability to deliver a superior product.  Further problems include what we are selling, clothes.  You don't need these clothes to skate so despite having a healthy fan base in skating we haven't found many people willing to pay the money to support our movement. My parents bought me inline skates for my birthday in 3rd grade.  I cried.  I didn't want them, wanted nothing to do with skating.  I fell down and kept falling down.  We had an unfinished basement and one day I decided to see how many laps I could do around all the bullshit in the middle without falling and to see how fast I could go.  Inline skates started what would be a long process of 'knocking the bitch' out of me."

rollerblading,3atcb2,kingofeggsandwiches,3,Thu Jul 2 15:45:17 2015 UTC,How long did it take you to start skating again after that big fall we saw in Straightjacket?
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,3,Wed Jul 1 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"3 months, I got in my car crash a few weeks later.  Wrecked my confidence though and I've never been the same.  Message from the blade god to stay in my lane. (literally and figuratively)."
rollerblading,3atcb2,kingofeggsandwiches,3,Wed Jul 1 23:37:01 2015 UTC,What would your advice be for someone who hasn't skated for 12 years and was just getting back into it and wanted to improve?
rollerblading,3atcb2,Vulgar_Slaughter,3,Wed Jul 1 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"I would just tell them to go out and have fun.  It takes 21 consecutive days of doing anything to develop a habit, so just get out there and strap them up."
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,2,Thu Jul 2 00:03:30 2015 UTC,To be fair just being able to handle ramps again has been like crack cocaine for me!
rollerblading,3atcb2,kipperfish,2,Thu Jul 2 00:12:34 2015 UTC,"Any chance that you'll be releasing some non-skinny jeans in the future? I'd quite like to try vibralux since I've heard they're pretty hard wearing jeans, but I'm more of a regular/loose-fit kinda guy.   Also any plans on doing larger sizes? I'm on the chunky side and need 38 to 40 inch waist."
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,2,Thu Jun 25 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"We tried that before but the market didn't hold for it.  As far as 38-40 inch waist lines go our main problem is cash flow.  To create a pattern for all available combinations of waists and inseams is a tremendous undergoing when you consider the addition of different types of fits.  There just isn't a market for a 38-40"" waistline in a non tapered jean in the inline market.  It's hard enough to forecast size sets with the 5-6 we have tried in the past.  It's a volatile market that can result in sitting on loads of stock.  We were asked to make 26's and when we finally did we ended up with 160 pairs that have been in stock going on 2.5 years.  With limited cash flow we are forced to consider our ROI and the risks associated with spending money pattern making/ production."
rollerblading,3atcb2,theghostofbillcosby,2,Thu Jun 25 20:00:45 2015 UTC,what's your favourite skate video of all time?  and why is it kfc 3?
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,3,Thu Jun 25 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"Concentration or Brain Fear Gone or WDYBI or Elements 2 or Leading the Blind.  Not really for any reason other than nostalgia.  I was at that age where I was still blown away by those guys, the envelope they were pushing, etc.    Favorite video I ever made was probably Charg!ng with Member's Only and On Top coming in a close second and third.  Working with your brothers is the biggest blessing that you can ever ask for.  The memories we made will last me a lifetime."
rollerblading,3atcb2,augman222,2,Thu Jun 25 20:04:09 2015 UTC,"Hey Adam, 2 questions for you!  Have you heard of On A Roll, and if so, have you worked with them at all?  Second question: Who was your favorite blader you have worked with?"
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"I've heard of On A Roll and I am interested to see what they can produce now that they have been fully funded.  Have yet to work with them.  Favorites are hard to choose.  Most obvious would be Alex since he is one of the reasons I am where I am today along with the KFC crew and WAR crew.  I have a lot of fun with a lot of different people for different reasons.  I would say anyone from the above crews, or anyone from our teams would be a solid start.  I try not to work with people I don't care for."
rollerblading,3atcb2,cardboardantlers,2,Wed Jul 1 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"Hey dude thanks for doing this,! Who is in your opinion the most talented skater you have been working with and why? And are there more VOD sections coming? Is there any skater you would like to film with in the future ? Thanks"
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,4,Mon Jun 29 10:31:59 2015 UTC,"You're welcome, thanks for participating.  Talent is subjective.  Is it who can go the biggest (still and in the past) or is it who can do the most tricks?  Who can skate the most variety of spots?  I'll go off the grid with this one and say the most refreshing section I've seen for free lately is Geoff Phillip and my favorite paid part (that I didn't get to make) was David from f33t or Farm from KCMO.  Just released a Don part today.  Probably my favorite section I have made in a few years, a true tale of redemption.  He's come a long way from the last time I was filming with him.  Stokes is driving here from Oregon with his girlfriend and Steve Gasstation to film his VOD.  I would love to make a Murda part, I give him shit about it frequently."
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,2,Wed Jul 1 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"Hi Adam, you seem to have a pretty realistic grip on how to build and market a brand. What advice might you offer to bladers considering investing their money in starting a company?"
rollerblading,3atcb2,meparadis,3,Tue Jun 30 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  My advice is that I have made and continue to make mistakes at every corner.  It's how I've learned.  When we made our first line of jeans we almost got fined $10k by the US for not having an importer tax number sewn into the garment. Got sued by James Dean's estate.  I've fucked up about everything you could think of.  My advice would be NOT to start a company unless you have a business degree, or be ready to spend lots of hours to not make money.  At the end of the day unless you own a boot company you probably won't make it.  It's a sad state, but hopefully it turns around.  Even the most battle tested pros who have started companies with financial backing have failed.  It takes lightning in a bottle.  We wouldn't still be here if it weren't for our riders being patient, designers working out of love, and using outside income to help move things forward."
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,2,Wed Jul 1 23:21:36 2015 UTC,"I have been trying to come up with relevant questions for a couple of days. I think I have failed, but oh well. 1. Can you think of one trick that you has made you most proud to witness in person? 2. Any chance of some throwback Vlux gear coming back (you hate to love it shirt)? 3. Chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, or veggie korma?"
rollerblading,3atcb2,phio666,2,Tue Jun 30 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"So hard to say.  Probably Don doing fast plant jump over the fence to soul a kink rail in Denver because I flew him back out on a different trip just to film that trick or Alex 540 through the tree/ hole or Bfree's ender in his VOD because he should have died on his first attempt, got up laced it but touched the wall, and then did it a third time no touch, flawless.  True pro shit. We've released the youhatetoloveit shirt twice now, going to let that one stay dead.  Not sure about anything else. Chicken tikka masala all day."

rollerblading,3atcb2,mhunter2,2,Wed Jul 1 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Hey AJ...thanks so much for doing this!  I'm curious, how hard is it for you to sponsor contests and events given the ""state of the industry""?  Do you still have to be fairly strict about how many you can support or is it not as much of an issue now that there are less comps/events?  I'm also incredibly happy and grateful that you were able to sponsor our comp and tour, the Indiana Blade Tour (shameless self promotion).  Thanks again, we will spread the good word about your brands!"
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:41:07 2015 UTC,"It's hard for us not only financially, but for me as a human.  It hurts to turn away a contest or not be able to support.  At a certain point though as a brand you need to make money to be successful and be able to help the people on the team.  For every contest, event that we 'support' we are taking away product that could make money.  The real problem is figuring out which is better promotion, giving away $100-200 worth of product (my resale value) to each contest/ event or taking away the sponsorships of those events to fly a rider somewhere to make content?  No telling in my opinion, just playing craps at this point."

rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,2,Wed Jul 1 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Carter is killing it, David and Chris, the Citilyfe or however the fuck you spell it, Amir, Ivan, SK, those are the guys I watch to try and learn how to not fuck up so bad.  Vintage Negrete and Hot Carl.  Other dudes who have stepped out of the scene and done cool shit and are bringing it back to blading is dope, but some of it doesn't give me the same feelings.  It's well produced, but not what I am into."
rollerblading,3atcb2,nathanhadley,2,Wed Jul 1 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"Hey AJ, I've got three for ya.   What's your opinion (or structure if you don't mind sharing) of the skater to filmer/editor revenue split on VODs? How can you see the Vibralux brand evolving to be more than a skate company? I've never tried your pants, would you consider them more a skate pant or an everyday pant?   Thanks!"
rollerblading,3atcb2,VibraluxDenim,3,Wed Jul 1 22:30:01 2015 UTC,"It's posted on all VODs we produce, 60% skater, 20% me, 20% future projects. Right now I don't, not for the next few years.  Fashion is such a competitive industry and since we are being honest here we aren't fashionable enough to jump shark.  Hell we are having a hard enough time convincing skaters to buy in. I wear mine everyday.  My mom asked if she could by me a pair of jeans because 9 times in 10 I'm wearing the brown LeRocks when we go out.  I told her I own lots of pants and to put her money away.

rollerblading,3atcb2,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:29:37 2015 UTC,"Alright Adam, I didn't ask a question but since you said you were willing to come back tomorrow I've got three:   The KFC series was and remains awe inspiring to me. Great music, excellent skating, solid blader production and it seemed like every video was amping me to skate harder than the last did. They made me do a lot of stupid shit I was not good enough to have any business trying by the way (I'm sure my parents would like to thank you and Alex for those ER visits)  So, what if anything would Adam in his early 30's tell a younger Adam to change about a series I think is damn near perfect? How do you feel about big wheels? Do you have a set to ride? I would imagine at the very least there could be some filming applications where a set could be helpful. Is Alex Broskow really one out of control dude? And did you guys really terrorize the streets of Kansas City with your hottest moves? <-- I still remember watching that on TV. I had to have been maybe 12 or 13 at the time!   I know I said it when we spoke on facebook, but thank you again for doing this AMA.

Petty, JJ or DL? 3) Top 5 most stylish skaters of all time? 4) Did you ever ride the Juice System? 5) What blade products do you buy? 6) Do you plan on travelling to film in Europe again? 7) M12s, Argons or Fattys? 8) What are you top 5 blade companies, dead or alive? 9) Who selects the music for your VODs? 10) How do you select which blades edits to watch online? Do you watch a video because of a particular skater/filmer or will you pretty much watch anything?  Sorry one last bonus question! Do you prefer blade comps that throw skaters into groups and skate at the same time, or individual runs?  Thanks a lot, for answering some/all of the above and keep up the good work!"
rollerblading,3atcb2,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:14:24 2015 UTC,"1) Hoax with VG coming in a close second. 2) I enjoyed Petty the most at the time, but have come to respect some of the other nuances in the other 2 as well. 3) Shane Skower, Alex Broskow, Don Bambrick, Dom Sagona, John Bolino I could go on forever. 4) Nope 5) I've been buying the v 13's recently and we make our own wheels and clothes.  I buy all the VODs that come out.  I've been rocking the same 12 tees since charging though haha.  Grab some random swag at trade shows. 6) Hopefully come that way very soon! 7) M12s, the non raised heals in Fattys always fucked me up and the argons we pretty heavy for my taste.  Also, my backslides in M12's were fucking butter. 8) Medium, Mindgame, Vibralux (my family), Valo, 976 9) The skaters have selected the songs for their parts 10) I give the edit 45 seconds to wow me and then I turn it off.  Music doesn't turn me off to the part, I'll just throw on my iTunes and watch for the skating.  I don't have a preference on how they skate, I do dislike the lengthening of contests.  There is a formula for winning and having an impact, and I feel like lengthening them based on crowd noise can result in people getting injured etc.  I also wish there were enough judges to cover the whole course.  That doesn't happen all the time."

rollerblading,3atye4,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure. But just go to a hardware store and bring your skates with you to make sure the hand riveter you'll be buying is going to work. I'm sure someone there will be able to make sure you get the right tool. We're not talking about something made specifically to work on inline skates or anything like that so it shouldn't be hard to find!"

The first time, we had ingested some psilocybin mushrooms.  That day stands as one of the 25 or so most formative days of my whole life.

rollerblading,3ashot,cyanicenine,2,Tue Jun 23 14:10:03 2015 UTC,Map my fitness
rollerblading,3ashot,jwrose,2,Tue Jun 23 15:40:53 2015 UTC,10 miles every day. Sometimes more. Love it.
rollerblading,3ashot,FRGL1,2,Tue Jun 23 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I picked up skating last season to stay fit for skiing in the winter.  I'm accustomed to spending 8 hours on the mountain when I go out, so if I've only been out skating for an hour I feel like I haven't been out for very long at all.  I end up doing about 1-2 hours and it turns out you can skate a really long ways in 2 hours.  Longest trip I did was 22ish miles.  I sometimes think about picking up larger wheels (on 80's atm) but I might run out of trail too fast if I did that.  Plus I like jumping off stuff with my hard boots.  I would probably do more 20+ mile treks except that I don't like to carry water so that ends up limiting me.  I also start to get foot pain and cramping once I get close to 2 hours."
rollerblading,3ashot,realitycheckk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:07:34 2015 UTC,That's awesome. I definitely want to try some bigger wheels like 100mm. There's a couple places on my typical route that have switchbacks but the mountain bikers have made short cuts. I think I could probably cut through with 100mm.
rollerblading,3ashot,fozbear92,2,Tue Jun 23 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"It would be worth a try.  I've had some success rolling over grass and dry packed dirt on my 80's so long as it's not wet (wet grass is a mistake!).  I like to try and skate down grassy hills when I'm bored.  Can be pretty fun, until you find that one patch that refuses to roll.  Larger wheels definitely seem like they would be better at off trail skating."
rollerblading,3ashot,BullHorn7,2,Tue Jun 23 23:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, I love long skates! Longest one for me was when I did the Napa Valley skate marathon a few years back."
rollerblading,3ashot,sylphs,2,Tue Jun 23 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"I think my record is 23km following the local tram line from South San Jose all the way to Sunnyvale. I had just received a box of new wheels, wanted an excuse to change them in, and my current set was so-so-ish, so I burned them hard."
rollerblading,3ashot,tehyosh,2,Wed Jun 24 03:34:51 2015 UTC,That's all I do! I pretty much created a 7 mile circuit around my house that I try to skate the minute I get home from work. I sometimes start it over again to see how far I can get. Skating in NYC always keeps it interesting.
rollerblading,3ashot,tehyosh,2,Thu Jun 25 22:03:40 2015 UTC,Ha yeah. that must be a bit of an obstacle course. I've got 8+ miles of continuous bike trails so I don't have to worry about traffic or anything. Maybe the occasional rabbit...

rollerblading,3arfa5,Largesaurus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:52:09 2015 UTC,Yeah sometimes I can appreciate it but in this instance I think it suffered from the stylized post-production. But people nitpicking the details of the edit is just indicating that the skating was flawless.

I still have noticed that the pledging since the past few days is getting more and more important. Pretty sure that the last 3-4 days are going to be good for the campaign since the project will appear on the front page of Kickstarter's website.

rollerblading,3apoca,WhenBeardsAttack,2,Mon Jun 22 22:16:17 2015 UTC,I don't support kick starters. Sorry.
rollerblading,3apoca,WhenBeardsAttack,3,Tue Jun 23 07:36:24 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I'm a gamer first and foremost, and I did not fund the game. There are probably 10-20 noteworthy gaming kickstarters going up every week, so to some extent you have to be very picky if you are going to fund people. On A Roll does not look bad by any means, but neither am I very interested in it, and I don't think I would play it even if I did fund or buy it.  There are many reasons for this that I can go into, but the first thing that I think most people will mention is that this is very derivative of Skate. That game has been done now, a new game has to iterate and improve on what has come before.  Something else to think of is that Skate sold pretty well, despite it being a fairly average game in many ways, because lots of people wanted to live the fantasy of being a pro skater, which is likely to be a common dream for young boys even if they never learned to ollie. Our culture is stuffed full of skateboarding, it has broad appeal, but can the same be said of rollerblading? I don't think so.  I do hope that the game does get funded because you guys clearly are excited for the game and thats cool, and also I want to see any game developers dream come true, but this is a dream that I chose not to take part in and I hope you can also respect that.  PS. I spend plenty of money on blading :)"
rollerblading,3apoca,Largesaurus,2,Mon Jun 22 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"All good mate Haha. Thanks for the response! I was a little trashed last night and am paying for it this morning.  I was just wondering what people's reasons are for not being interested &/or thoughts on why there are so few backers... Especially from businesses which are apparently large enough to fund the production and distribution of rollerblades and related merchandise to begin with.  If people aren't interested that's fair enough. I hadn't taken a look at it since day 1 and when I took a look last night, was really surprised with the figures.  I'm not surprised with skates poor performance either though, as many skateboarding games have been released over the years and the market is saturated. I saw 3 or 4 separate skateboarding games for PS3, browsing last week. There hasn't been a single Rollerblading game ever and although it's very similar, or almost identical in gameplay, in many ways, it's still may be more of a difference in gameplay than going from say Tony Hawks on PS1, to Skate on PS4; enough at least that I figured there'd be more of an interest by this point."
rollerblading,3apoca,WhenBeardsAttack,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah cool man, its interesting to talk about this stuff I think. Those are just my opinions of course. As for why SSM etc. aren't donating, I don't think it really works like that for companies, but if they decided to do brand sponsorship like in tony hawks that might be something they can still talk about towards the end of development, so who knows!   There hasn't been a single Rollerblading game ever   There have been a few actually, but is it possible you haven't heard of Jet Set Radio Future?! One of the best games of all time imo!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgtHdRGRqfk"
rollerblading,3apoca,adamcognac,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:41:24 2015 UTC,Haha nice. Yeah I'm not big in the whole gaming scene. Imma check that game out though. Cheers
rollerblading,3apoca,Largesaurus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:52:51 2015 UTC,"I for one am more excited about the potential for this game to popularize and expose our sport than I am to play it. Especially if multiplayer gets implemented, then the replay value will be pretty solid long after release. There are other people here who have also said that they're not interested in playing but would still like to support the game and in response to that in the AMA Jelle made more donation rewards that don't include the game.  And I would disagree on your point that skateboarding has broader appeal than inline skating. It has much more exposure and has pervaded in popular culture everywhere, but that does not mean it appeals to more demographics, what it does do is make people of marginally different backgrounds adopt skateboarder culture to become the stereotypical cool skateboarder kid. Now thankfully things are starting to change a bit and people don't care as much about fitting into a pre-determined image of a label, but this discrimination still exists and thrives in certain groups. A good example is the fact that ""What's the hardest part about rollerblading?"" is still as entertaining as ever for some imbeciles even though apparently in 2015 it's not supposed to be cool to hate on gays anymore.  I'm not trying to say that skateboarding is an evil xenophobic sport but comparatively, rollerblading has a broader appeal than skateboarding does. That's part of the reason why that homophobic platitude started, because there always were and still are all kinds of people who rollerblade, from the x-games participants going up against the skateboarders to the dudes in spandex showing off them sexy rollerblader thighs, and that is/was uncool and ""gay"". When someone says ""skateboader"" there is usually some predetermined basis of character and disposition conjured up in the mind. Not everyone will have the exact same image in mind, and a lot of what was once typical of a skateboarder can nowadays be argued against since they can come in many forms. But at the most basic level there are still some traits that come to mind when thinking of a ""skateboarder"", such as the image being that of a young male.  So what? Some may say that's hardly a generalization when (theoretically) half the world's population is also male, but with this predetermined image half the world's population is also excluded at the same time... and technically maybe even more than half is excluded since men live shorter lives and are more likely to die accidentally/commit suicide, etc.  Now this isn't to say that there aren't lots of female skateboarders; there are tons of them. But what I'm getting at is that when ""rollerblader"" comes to mind there aren't features or a culture that is as particularly distinguishing as there is with ""skateboarder"". One of the only places in the U.S. that the average person can think of where rollerblading isn't seen as an outstanding phenomenon is Venice Beach, and most people rollerblading are bikini-clad girls. If someone does imagine a rollerblader being male the only common feature amongst two imaginary rollerblading men is possibly a salient disregard for public opinion. For a lot of people, the only image that comes to mind with ""rollerblader"" is an emphasis on the skates themselves because it's hard to say that something is universal feature of a rollerblader.  The phrase ""rollerblading"" (or ""inline skating"" for the pedants) encompasses all disciplines including normal recreational/fitness/slalom skating, speed/downhill skating, aggressive skating, or summertime alternatives to hockey and figure skating.  Skateboarding represents nothing more than skateboarding, no one would think of a longboarder when you say skateboarder, the two phrases -and thus to an extent the sports themselves- are mutually exclusive. Skateboarding is more dissociating than inline skating is.  tl;dr: Skateboarding is widespread because lots of kids adopt the culture to do what's cool, they to some extent are altered to become a skateboarder whereas the image for a rollerblader is less defined and therefore more universal. Also this game means more than just virtual entertainment, it has real potential for a greatly positive impact for the sport.  p.s. Do you think your money is being effectively spent by the industry to develop and market itself right now?"
rollerblading,3apoca,adamcognac,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:54:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember watching Barely Dead, and there is a scene where they say that more people have done rollerblading than skateboarding in america, even at the lowest point of rollerbladings popularity, and I believe it. Now obviously what you guys are talking about is rec skating, not aggressive (or whatever we call it now). Trick skating has a totally different audience and style, it isn't the same market at all. That's like talking about BMX vs regular bicycles. Question is, is the cross-over appeal there? I don't think so, not right now anyway.  Also, I think your opinion if skateboarding culture is a bit wrong. When I think about skateboarding, I think about Welcome to Hell and Thrasher mag, but today I get marketing messages from Route One skate shop and the style is totally different. I can't relate to it at all actually. And there is also a huge longboarding subculture, I read that in south amerca it is the main type of skateboarding and pretty mainstream. I don't think that skateboarding is just one thing any more that rollerblading is.   p.s. Do you think your money is being effectively spent by the industry to develop and market itself right now?   I have no idea honestly. I have some Razor SL2s and they are great skates, so i'm happy with what they are doing where it counts most. But i'm not sure what more they can do right now, we might have to wait until something happens in our culture that will allow blading to sort of break through and get the respect it deserves."

rollerblading,3alayh,inshanealicious,2,Sun Jun 21 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"Taken from the Aggressivemall site: ""Razor skates run about 1/2 size small on their CULT model skates, and True to size on their Genesys model skates and SL model skates (Aragon 3, Bambrick). The shell sizes for all razor skates run in size ranges, which makes it easy to upsize or down size as long as you are staying your determined shell range. Razor boots are average in width.

So your advice is? 41, 42, 43?  Edit: Also I haven't skated for about 3 years. And the first pair I bougth was to big to me. I basicly bougth the first ones that I saw. They were from Rollerblade and the only ones available. IN my country there are close to zero options if not zero."
rollerblading,3alayh,Largesaurus,3,Sun Jun 21 15:47:34 2015 UTC,I would go with the 42. Call the shop to order them and see if you can just swap liners if they're too snug. Fitting a bigger liner in a smaller shell is pretty common for getting the best fit. Best of luck to ya!

He's was amazing when he was doing the 'traditional' type of aggressive skating, then he started moving more towards a creative/parkour style, which I'm assuming was partly influenced by skating with Ledoux and Dustin werbeski, then began doing some really cool stuff on big wheel skates. He's participated in slalom competitions, rollerblade marathons, roller hockey, and every possible variation of wheeled boot activity. Leon is a true ambassador of the sport of rollerblading."

You're in for a treat if this your first time seeing parkour on wheels!"
rollerblading,3aggg8,Largesaurus,2,Sat Jun 20 00:16:10 2015 UTC,"I have seen Mathieu Ledoux before and like how he threw in the whole parkour vibe every now and again but his videos seemed to be predominantly traditional aggro style skating.  I honestly think that if more skate videos showed this kinda of skating it'd reach out better and draw the interest of more people towards the sport than the same old 'jump on object, slide down object, jump off object' video style that aggressive has been stuck in for like 20 years(ish).  disclaimer - I'm not saying that parkour hybrid will save rollerblading."
rollerblading,3aggg8,Chmrn,3,Sat Jun 20 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what I think too. But I guess it may be a little much to expect a full edit of inline parkour right now. Hopefully in the future skaters just keep pushing boundaries until everyone is expected to be able to vault over and climb up walls just like any basic grind, that would be amazing beyond words to see."

So many rollerbladers have seen the link, I can't understand why they don't realise the value of this opportunity. The CRS frames were funded by less than half the backers On a Roll has and they funded several thousand dollars more than On a Roll currently has.  There needs to be more sponsors for this, Rollerwarehouse hasn't even mentioned it at all.  *wording"
rollerblading,3afuku,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Jun 19 20:51:51 2015 UTC,"in two days Amalls post for kickstarter has managed a pathetic grand total of 11 likes while in twenty hours their pic of a remz gc big setup was liked by over 150 people   Likes on facebook have no correlation whatsoever to donations though. 200 ""likes"" won't guarantee 200 donations anymore than it will 2. Its just superfluous data. There isn't an aggressive rollerblader out there who hasn't heard of this project by now and I've seen plenty of kickstarter links from other pages on facebook with much more attention. So that AMALL post is nothing to worry about.   I can't understand why they don't realise the value of this opportunity.   Many see what they feel is disappointing alpha footage and have decided not to back the project, it's their decision and I don't agree with it at all. But that's the explanation.   The CRS frames were funded by less than half the backers On a Roll has and they funded several thousand dollars more than On a Roll currently has.   The two projects have no relation. But I'll explain the discrepancy anyway, Create Originals was asking for $30k US and raised a total of $37,211. Most backers for the CRS frames pledged between $50-$110 US. Because this was the sweet spot to earn themselves a set of the frames.  With On A Roll they are asking for $50k US and have so far raised $34,294 at the time of writing. The majority of their donations have been coming from people putting up $15-$50 (and even then an overwhelming majority have been donating between $15 and $30) Because that was what was being asked for in exchange for the game.  I truly hope this gets funded, I've been following the game for a long time and I agree with your point that more companies need to pick up the sponsorship level backings. In the last post about this game I wrote at length about it so I won't repeat myself but the CRS campaign's success is an unfair comparison.   edit: spelling."
rollerblading,3afuku,Largesaurus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"As much as I understand your point, I kinda feel sad too that the AMALL post had so many few likes. I was looking forward to it to make the project known a bit more since AMALL fanbase is no doubt one of the biggest in this industry. That being said, I was asking myself a question: What if it was missing, let's say, 10,000$ a the end of the campaign. Can Jelle just back his own project by dropping the 10K missing and still manage to get the 40K he raised? By doing that he'd be just paying himself the money and he would not lose anything here...? Would that be a legitimate method?"
rollerblading,3afuku,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:46:35 2015 UTC,"Likes don't directly equate to donations, yes, but they do gauge the followers' level of support and desire to promote the cause. If hardly anyone cared to like then they don't care to show support or spread the word to keep the campaign moving because they don't see the value in it. If you've donated why would you not also waste a split second to like the post and show others that you back the project?  Yeah the rest of my post was mindless ranting -which I don't often do :P - and I could see why the campaigns would pan out differently, but still, I'm amazed that the people who would pay for the frames wouldn't see that this game has potential to do so much more for the sport and enhance their skating experience in ways skate hardware can't. They've proven that cost is not the deterrence for them, it's the lack of perspective.  I'm not going to start listing off all the things that could potentially happen if this game gets made, but no one can understate the power of video games such as the Tony Hawk series. This is the chance to be funding real advancement for the sport. How can people not realise that?   *And, oh man, the skate companies. If there aren't more sponsorships I'll just be astounded at their ignorance and blatant abhorrence of sensible marketing decisions.  Consider me vexed."

I think you're getting hung up on something trivial because you saw that AMALL posted a link and it only got a few ""likes.""  I think its a poor way to judge how rollerbladers view the project. But if I can go along, I'd point out The Conference made a similar post within about 24 hours of the AMALL post on their own facebook page.  The Conference's post got 120 likes yet they only have 23k total likes for their page. The AMALL post has 16 as of right this moment but they have 25k likes for their page over 2k more! What does all of this mean for the success of the kickstarter? Well, not much of anything.  I understand that like most of us you really want this project to get funded but you're getting hung up on irrelevant details. Go post a link in some gaming forums, spread the word on facebook groups, both for bladers and gamers! There's plenty of productive things you, myself, and everyone can do to help get this project funded (it doesn't have to just be donating!) but counting the amount of ""likes"" every shared post gets on facebook isn't one of them."
rollerblading,3afuku,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Sat Jun 20 07:07:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could be completely wrong about this but I simply don't understand why anyone who cares about the campaign at all couldn't bother to click the stupid little button.

rollerblading,3afuku,Largesaurus,2,Sat Jun 20 07:34:50 2015 UTC,"Probably because they specifically subscribe to the Aggressive Mall facebook page to see setup pictures, etc. so that content attracts the most engagement on their specific page? I'm not running their page so I'm just taking a guess.  I don't know what they usually post or what typically gets the most engagement. None of it really matters though. Likes are a poor indicator of how many people actually followed the link to the kickstarter page.  edit: Digital marketing and social media management is a really complex field and there are tons of variables that can affect why a post is less successful from one day to the next. There's a reason people get degrees in this stuff! haha"

They never fit right, they are heavier, and if the padding inside goes, you have this formed styrofoam cap on.   I'd use the triple 8 soft lined one. Has no foam core. Only soft panels. Just a way better helmet. The foam core is slightly more protective since it will crack before the shell will, but not by enough to get me to rock one. I'd rather my helmet didn't feel like shit.   Also, Bern helmets are rad and have a little visor lip for sun protection. Great plastic too."

I don't really care if it takes blowing half a years rollernews advertising budget on this game, it's money better spent and they're going to be needed for this final funding push.  edit: I should say I know of plenty of smaller brands who have pitched in with what they can afford but my point is that without the large brands pitching in too to purchase these upper tier billboard ads this game is going to have a hard time finishing it's funding goals.

Really cool to see the wizard frames getting used for some more traditional grinderblading tricks too, whatever happened to x-grinds anyway?  Two questions for you, does the natural rocker make a noticeable difference in the frames performance? (as far as I know it's never been made clear whether it's a performance/maneuverability decision or exclusively about preventing uneven wheel wear) And here's the $400 question, would you buy a set now?"

rollerblading,39sjel,scramfarious,3,Sun Jun 14 09:54:50 2015 UTC,"It's sorta hard to find the line between am/pro in blading nowadays. I'd say there are very few (like literally maybe 10-wild guess) bladers that blade for a living and don't have other jobs to support themselves.   That doesn't really answer your question though. I guess you don't ""have to"" be am first- but it's just sort of the way things work most of the time. There's no governing body in rollerblading. Basically everyone is an am until someone decides they want to pay them to skate.  Also- no idea on Broskow's timeline- but I remember he sort of came out of no where with a few insane parts at a really young age and made a name for himself very quickly."

rollerblading,39qioq,Johnmarmalade,5,Sat Jun 13 19:47:02 2015 UTC,"Jump into grass, practice the form you want for your grind. Translate it over to a low rail. If you have a p-rail you can then take over the grass, even better. How you face your body will also help keep those boots from sliding off."
rollerblading,39qioq,Stickeesox,4,Sat Jun 13 20:28:10 2015 UTC,bend your knees more and put most of your weight on your back foot. practice the position by stalling on a ledge or a curb a ton. you should be able to jump on a curb and hold your position for a couple of seconds when your ready to try the rail again.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBg6v9W1aJM
rollerblading,39qioq,adrock3000,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:40:05 2015 UTC,"It takes practice; I've been blading for 3 years and still can't quite royale. Keep bending those knees, don't spread your feet too wide, and then get used to pushing your upper body forward a bit."
rollerblading,39qioq,chowaniec,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"I had trouble with the royale as well at first. Well really I still do.. But anyway the tip that Brian uses in this video: https://youtu.be/LHrunlDPYCk where he tells you to practice jumping onto a line on the ground helped me a lot. More or less start with the line vertical compared to your body and jump up and land with the line centered on your skate frames in the royal stance. Took me awhile to build strength/confidence in my knees for this grind but you'll get it after awhile.  Couple personal tips: bend your knees well before you get to the rail so you aren't so upright when you jump onto it. If you approach almost in a sitting type position, especially on lower rails, your body has less of a distance to travel to get into the royal stance and therefore less time for your boot to settle on the rail. This also helps for balance and after awhile you'll wish you had a longer rail to get the feel of it more. When your frame/boot finally settle you'll definitely know because you have a lot more balance. Also when I royal I approach almost directly behind the rail so I don't slide off so fast after my momentum is carried forward. This also makes you jump onto the rail which will make you a better grinder overall.   And don't lose hope! I'm 22 and still suck it up and wipe out at the skatepark all the time! Keep at it and in a little while you'll wonder why you ever had trouble with the royal"
rollerblading,39qioq,Infinosity,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:39:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't start with royale as your first trick to get down. You need to train your ankles to bend a bit. The soul grind is the perfect way to do that. I'd start with that, from there your soul foot ankle will get used to bending and be stronger. Then the royale pressure to get your boot down will feel more easily attainable.  Also as others have said, put the p-rail into the grass. Roll into it and when you hop off just walk it out in the grass."

rollerblading,39jfeh,sprucejenner,7,Fri Jun 12 03:38:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe less important for beginners and probably not a super popular opinion but wear a helmet.  I would not really call myself a beginner I guess, but it stands. I fell when I didn't give myself enough forward movement coming up a 13 foot ramp, so I guess I fell about 13 feet upside down onto my head. Helmet took a fall that could have killed me and made it into a bad concussion. Even if you aren't going to do vert, a bad fall on flat ground could really screw you up at the right speed."
rollerblading,39jfeh,chrrisyg,7,Fri Jun 12 06:27:33 2015 UTC,"less important for beginners   I would say the exact opposite! If you're a beginner chances are you will be tripping and falling quite a lot (it's normal and totally ok!) and thus a helmet will most likely be a great thing to have on your head. Plus, if there's one thing we don't want is for you to quit skating because you injured yourself and developed a fear/trauma of skating.  As you progress and start landing some tricks with confidence you might not need the helmet anymore FOR THOSE BASICS. But if you're moving into more advanced stuff (which you will eventually) you'll still want that helmet.  I guess what I'm trying to say is: always wear a helmet!"
rollerblading,39jfeh,kav-,5,Fri Jun 12 09:36:18 2015 UTC,Get comfortable just skating before you start trying to do tricks.  Don't be in a rush.  That's how you get hurt

rollerblading,39jfeh,thisismy20,3,Fri Jun 12 04:52:54 2015 UTC,"5th elements are widely beloved classic skate (although I didn't like them when I had them), the wheels will likely not hold up too long though. Get as comfortable as possible skating before throwing yourself into tricks and grinds, and like mentioned by another person, learn to fall."
rollerblading,39jfeh,k2rolla503,3,Fri Jun 12 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"One thing few people seem to mention: remember that getting comfortable on skates takes a fair while. You aren't gonna be a pro on  day one.  Expect a couple months of regular skating before you get real comfortable. But if you skate regularly, it'll come for sure!  Have good time!"
rollerblading,39jfeh,jokingrotten,2,Fri Jun 12 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, confidence can be your best friend and your worst enemy. Take your time to get a hang of skating itself (if you are a skating beginner overall), practice the grinds on small obstacles on a flat surface. There's no extra points for skipping the basics and going for high style moves. Everyone started out small!  Like almost everything else in life, once you know the basics and can do grinds on easy obstacles, doing more advanced stuff and grinds on more difficult obstacles will be just a matter of time and practice.  Also, LEARN TO FALL! Knowing how to position your body and brace for impact is underrated, you'll avoid lots of trouble/injuries/pain if you know how to hit the ground.  Perhaps most importantly, HAVE FUN!!"
rollerblading,39jfeh,kav-,2,Fri Jun 12 09:42:16 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, learn how to blade properly.  Blading around is one of the most enjoyable things I like to do.  I don't need to do tricks to have fun but I still like to challenge myself and go hit up some ledges when the feeling arises.  Wear pads and start slow and learn the basics - blade forwards, backwards, crossovers, jumping, turning around, etc...  Find some other people to blade with, preferably a little bit better than you and make sure to go out a few days a week.  One you've mastered the basics, you'll want to check out this trick trips on the Aggressivemall youtube page.  They are really helpful.     https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDNzpTyOzLmqUKQwb4l-uJz894-m93u6E"

New frame placement made them better.  May give you bunions. Nills are probably all the same, just different colors. Razors gen: Tanks.  True grinderblade. Not the best for bowls/rolling around but great for grinding.  The liners may be good or bad depending on which one you get. Razors SL: Solid. same liner problem as gens. Valo: Buy roces m12's, they are cheaper and have better liners.  The skins are mostly useless unless you toe cut the boot. Seba: Great if they fit.  Skin rips easily. Adapt: Not worth the money.  The cuff is STIFF, almost painful.  The skin rips easier than sebas.  A few people broke them in half. Carbon 4 (liner ones): Liner is good. If they hurt them you can spot mold them with a heat gun/ hair dryer.  People complain that carbon soles are slow.  ALL USDs have hardware issues, a trip to the hardware store to get better bolts and some locktite will solve the problem.  As far as breaking parts/laces.... welcome to aggressive skating, shit's gona break from time to time."
rollerblading,397j8u,bigjoeboss,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:47:23 2015 UTC,Thank you for your opinions!  Remz: I've tried some old remz a few weeks ago and didn't like the frame placement but the boot felt good. My concern with remz is that they look bulky. I'm not sure if they are fun for powerblading. But the new Nils looks (and should be as far as shop information goes) slimmer.  Valos: The only Valos I would consider are those without skins.  Adapt: Apart from the money the cuff sure is stiff. But I'm curious for opinions on the 2015 shell. I really liked the forward flex and they look like you could use them as powerblades. Sadly there are not many opinions on adapts from people who own them.
rollerblading,397j8u,wishihadaps42,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:54:44 2015 UTC,I was skating a lot as a kid. Playing hockey and catch is the best way to learn basic skating. After my 10 year break I still felt like a fish thrown back in the water. I'm a pretty good freestyle skater. The only thing I've never done was going down ramps or grinding but on basic obstacles it's not about being talented. Just muscle memory and conquering fear. When I got back into blading having a rockered setup felt really weird. I bought the kaltiks stealth to ride flat aswell but I wouldn't recommend it as a beginner. Wheelbite is an issue with Soulgrind and will make you fall. Nowadays I'm back on FLT3 again because the flat setup made me afraid of soulgrinds. Just try it out you can still swap the inner wheels for antis if it's not your thing. And don't feel bad for not staying with flat as a beginner. Everything that takes away frustration is legitimate.

rollerblading,390ka4,CaptainObviousSpeaks,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"Saw this a few days ago, it's pretty cool seeing skiers on blades. Their approach is familiar but you can see subtle indications that they just aren't rollerbladers.  Like the ender, bs farv to bs royale, thats a switch up you won't see in blading edits because for all intents and purposes ""it doesn't count."" So it's kind of like someone who does not speak your language natively confusing phrases from time to time or using a word in an uncommon/anachronistic way."

Speaking of weird tricks, will battery grinds make a comeback??"
rollerblading,39258f,kub0n,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"First of all how long have you been skating for? It's something to factor in when giving recommendations. Also, what exactly are you hoping to get out of your inline skate? i.e. regular high milage fitness skating, moderate cardio or light recreational skating?  It's also not a simple matter of whether wheel sizes are the same, that doesn't account for the price discrepancy. Only that the other model you're looking at has a frame which can house up to 90mm wheels too. Build quality and stock hardware are more of a factor in pricing.  Short answer, without any of the info I asked for; yes there is a difference between the two models and it's not an arbitrary pricing. Does it make it worth getting for you? I cannot say yet without knowing your experience level and what you expect to do with your pair."
rollerblading,39258f,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"I use my skates for transport, going to and from school and for getting between classes.  I've been skating since I was around 7 so I know how to handle myself, far from anything more than basic at freestyle.  Edit: pretty much looking to get to and from class quickly and efficiently, skating about a mile to school each day. Thanks for the info!"
rollerblading,39258f,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:47:17 2015 UTC,"Well skating since you were seven doesn't answer the question as I have no frame of reference for that haha but I'll assume it means you aren't a beginner! I think either model will suit your transportation needs. You'll just want to swap out the wheels as soon as they wear out with a higher quality wheel and you'll be fine.  Of the two, I'd personally get the VO2 because it sounds like you'll be using these skates much more frequently than a casual rec skater would, plus it'll give you everything you need if you decide you want to step up your game and try to start putting in more mileage on your blades.  Now as far as the X model goes, the hi-lo frame can give you faster acceleration off the line but really it's only helpful for racers, I don't see much advantage to use a hi-lo setup for transportation or moderate fitness skating but ultimately that one can boil down to personal preference. I hope this helps, if you have any other questions let me know, that's what we're here for!"
rollerblading,39258f,jopeymonster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"Just to elaborate - the K2 FIT BOA does allow it to fit up to 90mm wheels, so if you have not been actively skating on 84 or 90mm wheels, this would be a good way to go so that you can progress at your own pace for the large wheel size.  Since both the FIT and VO2 you mentioned have BOA, the major difference is going to be the boot design; VO2 does have Vortech ventilation and it helps reduce the heat inside the boots, as well has having a different cuff design.  The FIT and VO2 cuff when compared are a little different, with the VO2 being a little more forward flexible due to shorter cut and the FIT would maintain a little better support.  So if you have been skating and want to gear more toward training, faster, or further distance skating, the VO2 would be better.  Sounds more like you are looking for a transportation skate that is not really used outside of getting to/from destination, so the FIT in this aspect would be better.  Links for skates discussed:  K2 FIT 84 BOA  K2 VO2 90 BOA  K2 VO2 100 X BOA  EDIT:    Also do the 100 mm wheels on the 100 X really make you go that much faster?   The 100 X is a little misleading because the X infers HiLo which is large wheels in the back and smaller wheels in the front, in this case 100mm in the back and 90mm in the front.  As for speed, this is dependent on the skater, as large wheels have better potential for higher speed, they are more demanding and require longer strides that reduce maneuverability."
rollerblading,39258f,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your reasoning that the FIT is the better option, for one thing cuff height amounts to personal preference, a higher cuff while providing more support does not necessarily mean it'll be a more appropriate transportation skate especially when we're talking about anyone beyond the beginner stage of skating.  Assuming OP is budgeted for both options I'd say the VO2 is going to be the superior option. As you noted, the VO2's have k2's vortech ventilation and good venting is kind of important in a soft boot skate that's going to get regular use going to and from class.  Ultimately, we're talking about two different models separated by roughly $80-100 with a large amount of purpose specific overlap. The VO2's are the better option but if you're on a budget or unsure about sticking with skating the FIT is perfectly adequate. But if OP goes with the FIT I'd at least recommend taking that money they saved and buying a pack of Rollerblade Hydrogen wheels."
rollerblading,39258f,phreakmonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:28:14 2015 UTC,"For a while I was skating 3 miles to/from work and wearing the skates all day at work.  I upgraded from some older K2 skates to the K2 V02 90 Boa skates that you're considering, and I love them.  The boot is light and comfortable, and that ventilation system really works.   (And oh god is the boa systems awesome!)    The 90mm wheels took a little getting used to at first, especially in speed straightaways.. I had a pretty bad fall where I let myself get ahead of my comfort zone early on and then got wobbly trying to correct for something.  (Stay low, especially at speed!!)  But after that I didn't have any problem.   IMHO people overstate the ""they're less maneuverable"" aspect.  Yes, they have a bit more resistance to pivoting, but I can do tight turns and simple outside-spins on them.  I haven't perfected Bill Stoppards drag-to-powerslide stop on them yet, but I might start tackling that eventually if I get brave.  ;)    I bought them because I often wear skates all day long.  Everyone's different though so I'd suggest buying from a place that will let you swap them for something else after a week if you don't like the fit or something.      My $0.02"

rollerblading,38u9ji,shay311,7,Sat Jun 6 21:46:03 2015 UTC,"Like the others, I would recommend learning how to T-stop as it's much more effective and safe at high speeds. In the mean time, you could grind down the new brake by hand in order to get it to a comfortable level."
rollerblading,38u9ji,Johnmarmalade,10,Sun Jun 7 03:51:43 2015 UTC,By taking off your break and learning proper stopping methods. A heel break wont save you if you are going too fast.
rollerblading,38u9ji,gypsyblader,6,Sun Jun 7 01:01:48 2015 UTC,"Fully acknowledging I'm not answering your question; I would also recommend removing the brake and learning to stop. The skill level at which a heel brake might be useful is the same level where one could be learning to use something like a T-stop. This will not only serve the same purpose, but improve your skating and what not."
rollerblading,38u9ji,Stickeesox,3,Sun Jun 7 01:56:47 2015 UTC,"I would just like to say that while I do think it's beneficial for you to learn alternative stopping techniques and be able to skate without it I do think that this sub has gotten a little overzealous in their disapproval of heel brakes. It definitely has certain uses over other techniques especially for new or casual skaters.  To address your question, some heel brakes can be adjusted to be turned higher up so that the brake isn't hovering two millimetres above the road surface. If you can't adjust them, then you could stagger your stance so that the braking skate is a little further ahead of the other skate before and during the braking. Bending the knees and getting lower helps to keep balance. Other than that or adjusting the brake (or grinding it down manually in the extreme case) I don't think there's much more you can really do about it."
rollerblading,38u9ji,Largesaurus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:45:12 2015 UTC,Like it was suggested before. Grind the break down.  Personally I hate the heel brake.

The Street Invader wheels are solid for urban skating too.

rollerblading,38i8nn,puregenius,4,Fri Jun 5 10:59:58 2015 UTC,"I would like to start rollerblading about 3-4 times a week during the summer months for athletic performance/cardio. roller blades for this goal.  What brands and type of roller blades would you recommend?   The two big decisions you want to make are: soft boot Vs hard boot and 80mm Vs 90mm Vs 100mm.  Generally speaking, soft boots will be more comfortable but less responsive.   Similarly, larger wheels will be better for maintaining speed, but will be less agile.   If you are more of a sprinter or are interesting in doing some tricks or jumps, I recommend going with a hard boot small wheel skate like the Seba FR1 or the Rollerblade Twister 80.  If your goal is to cruise around on bike trails, doing a lot of steady state cardio, I recommend going with big wheels and maybe a soft boot. Examples here are the K2 VO2 with 100mms or the Rollerblade Tempest.   Or maybe you have a mix of preferences and you want a skate that can do it all. For this, I recommend 90mms and a hard boot. Good examples are the Rollerblade Maxxum 90 and the Seba Trix 90.  There are a million permutations, but this should be a good starting point for you. Good luck and let us know if you need more help."
rollerblading,38i8nn,davidykay,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"I have a pair of K2 VO2's with 90mm for skating 10-18mi on bike paths 3-4 days a week. Love them and I think for learning 90's were a good choice, but now I want some 100mm wheels and as much speed as I can pour on. Also sometimes wish the shell was slightly stiffer but they are comfortable as hell."
rollerblading,38i8nn,saypataca,2,Sat Jun 6 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"Rollerblade is a brand  Inline skates recommended for cardio/ athletic performance? Get a decent pair of fitness skates like http://www.inlinewarehouse.com/Rollerblade_Maxxum_84_Skates_Size_90/descpage-MAX84.html  ^ the Max 84 has the twister shell which is supportive and has good ventilation for summer heat...

The K2 FIT 84 are decently comfortable (make sure you get a good tight fit as fitness boots dont provide great support) but the frames will give out on you eventually if you do tricks and jumps! If you see the 84mm K2 fitness skates on sale for really cheap, go for it!"

They fit extremely well, and that kicked-in-the-shins feeling you normally get from a pair of brand new skates until you break them in? Never had that from Solomons.   Another excellent brand is Xsjado. They redesigned the skate from the foot outward, beginning with a comfortable shoe, then creating a skate shell that fits it. They're a little more expensive though. I've never owned them but an old friend of mine in high school had a pair and I tried them."
rollerblading,38i8nn,graaahh,2,Thu Jun 4 20:46:14 2015 UTC,OP is looking for athletic performance/cardio skates. Xsjado aren't designed for that. If anything Doop would be more appropriate but even then a traditional soft or hard shell design would be a much better option. Step in skates will never really be ideal for performance skating.
rollerblading,38i8nn,PROFESSIONAL_FART,0,Fri Jun 5 01:41:31 2015 UTC,Probably a very good point - I've never skated purely for exercise so I don't really know what would be best for that. Those are just the two most comfortable brands I've ever worn.

rollerblading,38e8sh,Reelbk,3,Wed Jun 3 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"I don't get it.  What about things like these:  https://torrentfreak.com/piracy-boosts-cd-sales-071103/  https://torrentfreak.com/file-sharers-buy-more-movies-121018/  Not everyone can or wants to buy every VOD. If that's the case, why would you prohibit them from taking part in blading culture by not giving them access to the content? If they absolutely want to get the video for free, I'm sure they'll find a way.  I get that the subreddit mods don't want illegal copies in their subreddit, that's cool with me. But the stance some people are taking, ""fuck you if you don't pay to watch this"", is dumb as fuck. Rollerblading is not some exclusive country club, and people shouldn't have to pay to take part and not be called assholes.  Putting a paywall in front of this culture isn't cool, for one. At the same time I think that fighting ""piracy"" is (or can be) actually detrimental to sales.   Instead of asking pros to sell-out, why is it so taboo to ask rollerbladers to buy-in?   It's not, or shouldn't be. But demonizing ""pirates"" does nothing either."
rollerblading,38e8sh,franzwithbenefits,6,Wed Jun 3 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"With this same logic I guess you wouldn't object to anyone stealing their first pair of skates because    ""people shouldn't have to pay to take part and not be called assholes.""   The aggressive inline market is a niche industry within a niche industry so I don't think there is a single person who wants to make skate edits exclusively for those who are willing to pay to see it, they're just releasing some material with which they want to see a marginal ROI for the people involved. There is far more than enough free content out there, including some of those VODs and even entire skate films become free to view after a while. With all the content flowing through rollernews, on Bladearchive, or elsewhere on the internet you can't say that people don't have a way to consume more than enough current media for free.  As someone else said, they don't have a film studio to eat their losses and thus piracy directly steals from the guy you see skating on your screen and the filmers/editors. It's easy to justify piracy when you're being screwed over by the big bad billion-dollar media conglomerate but everyone involved in the making of these edits are doing it with true love and dedication that can't be evidenced any more genuinely than by the merits of the final product as well as all the literal blood spilled in the process. They do all of this to be released as completely free content repeatedly so I think it's fair enough for them to ask for more than the price of free once in a while on quality material."
rollerblading,38e8sh,Largesaurus,5,Wed Jun 3 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"The thing that a lot of people don't get is that rollerblading does not have the money nor the resources that the movie and music industries have. In the movie industry, every actor is paid before shooting a film. If there is any loss, the studio eats that loss, but the actor can act in another movie, and the studio has the money to make another film and recoup. In the blading world, these riders, directors, cameramen, etc, don't have the financial backing of a studio. It's more than likely that 1 person is playing all those roles, and they're not getting any money until AFTER the vod drops and people buy it. We are effectively bankrolling the current, and potentially future vod. If the vod bombs, our favorite 'actors' are more than likely gonna be forced to dedicate their time and resources to other endeavors outside of blading, leading them to quit all together on making edits and vods, because, well fuck, we can't all live at our parents house bill free forever. The torrent freak pages linked, while true for the movie and music industry, doesn't really ring true for the niche industry that is rollerblading."

Videos aren't how rollerblading companies make money; that's why they're called rollerblade companies. VOD's a band-aid on the bigger problem of blading appealing to a small market, which is why riders don't get paid more in the first place. VOD is a novel way to make money while times are tough, but I think /u/franzwithbenefits is right about it also limiting blading's exposure."
rollerblading,38e8sh,chowaniec,6,Wed Jun 3 21:08:33 2015 UTC,but I think /u/franzwithbenefits[1]  is right about it also limiting blading's exposure.   But this would be a stronger argument if the same people putting out the occasional VOD series weren't also putting out hours upon hours of free content. There's no shortage of available content anyone so inclined can be exposed to.
rollerblading,38e8sh,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean that's a business decision these guys have to make: put it out for free as promotional material to attract new customers, or get your eager existing customers to pay you? I think there's a place for both. I personally have zero interest in VODs that aren't full length, so shorter edits seem better spent on promotion to me."
rollerblading,38e8sh,chowaniec,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"And obviously these guys have decided to go the VOD route because most of their customers have been blading for years, know who they are and are willing to buy content as well as their jeans.  Marketing aimed at those outside of the aggressive rollerblade industry is too expensive and is better suited for the major boot companies instead of a clothing company like Vibralux.  I don't blame these guys for going the VOD route as it makes more financial sense to appeal to a smaller but more dedicated fan base."
rollerblading,38e8sh,doobiousone,6,Thu Jun 4 06:49:08 2015 UTC,"What I don't get about the pirating of VODs, is, you are saying ""Farmer's skating is so fucking sick, I'll do whatever it takes to watch it, except give him a $5 so he can keep doing it to entertain me."""
rollerblading,38e8sh,dickheadjustin,3,Wed Jun 3 20:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, that sums up my thoughts on the matter. I know some people make the argument about not being able to afford it, and that's kind of weak, welcome the real world. There's lots of things I want but can't afford at the exact moment I'd like to have it.   However, in this case, Vibralux releases hours of footage for free. It's not all VOD. So if you can't afford the VOD this time and don't have a friend who bought it, there's still tons of footage of Farmer you can watch for free and it's all perfectly legal."
rollerblading,38e8sh,PROFESSIONAL_FART,3,Wed Jun 3 20:25:32 2015 UTC,"Idunno, I think people on both sides of the fence need to stop taking shit so personally. People aren't entitled to free videos, but they're not obligated to buy them either."

rollerblading,38e8sh,chowaniec,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"Just to nitpick here, technically whoever did this actually did buy the VOD so they could share it with everyone else for free. If you really want to jump in the gray area, have you ever bought a movie and shown it to a friend? Did you charge them money to see it and send that money to the owners? How about music? How about anything you've ever bought in your entire life? Have you ever shared anything with anybody? The point is that while in this case pirating the content was blocking potential income, it was not technically stealing it was illegal sharing. It was very shitty to do this to people who are actually in need of that money vs a large faceless corporation who wipes their asses with 100s for sure. So before anybody freaks out let me just reiterate, I do not advocate pirating skaters VODs. They work hard and deserve the money. I'm just saying there is a gray area when it comes to stealing, illegally sharing and just sharing."
rollerblading,38e8sh,thisismy20,0,Wed Jun 3 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"Sheit, I'm famous!  BAHAHAHAHAH  The first thing I would like to adress here is AJ.  He really isn't that good at making videos, his friends are good at rollerblading.  (this will get the sheep angry) Ok, beyond AJ's lack of talent, Chris Farmer is a ""pro"" skater.  This means it is his profession.  It's his job to skate, be seen skating and promote his sponsors products.  Any edit or video he appears in is by definition advertising for his sponsors.  Advertising is, and should be, free.  When you pay for entertainment like HBO or a movie in a cinema there aren't any commercials.  Why would I pay to see advertising?  I wouldn't.  It's not our fault pro skaters are more interested in the status than money.  It's not our fault that they allow their sponsors to ass rape them.  It's pretty sad that most pros can't even afford to buy the skates they promote but we are expected to buy the skates AND give the pro a tip in exchange for the privilege to see an advertisement.  Fucking insane.  Frankie Morales, like him or not, is a professional.  He gets dat money.  Powerslide not only gives him a check for selling skates, they also cut him a check for his share of Gawds.  He got himself a good deal. The Yasutokos have large Japanese corporations backing them.  Aragon was getting money from skull candy. Haffey gets a paycheck and travels the world doing shows.  Why can't other ""pro"" skaters do the same?"
rollerblading,38e8sh,the_mike_jibbs,3,Wed Jun 3 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"Franky and Haffey both have VODs, too. And everything where someone is wearing a brand is technically a commercial. But actors in commercials are paid.   Aragon quit skating to pursue business. If AJ wasn't good at making videos, people wouldn't buy them, or even look at them. So I guess AJ not quitting can make good business.   Using your logic, Game of Thrones (produced by HBO) is technically a commercial to buy the books, and cinematic movies make more money on royalties for products that most other avenues. So, yeah, those are commercials for action figures.   You're famous like Dylan Harris and Eric Klebold. Let me know if you ever want to reveal your identity. I'd love to interview you."

VX has been pressured to offer their products to a wider audience and AJ as repeatedly refused.  Why?  Because the groms love him.  His video skills are, at best, average.... for 2002.  It""s 2015, shit should be glossy and pretty and not recorded with a DSLR like the farmer VOD section.  He constantly cries about video cost but never invests in equipment or education.  If he were half as good as he claims with a camera he would be in the union filming NFL games.  Yet, the man groms warship him because he orders 75 pair of jeans from American Apparel and resells them at 200%.  Shit's weak.  If Broskow wasn't his friend, nobody would know who he is."

You just want free content and are trying to justify not paying for something you want.  You're entire argument is a nonsensical diatribe -  Step 1 - Insult video editor/director  Step 2 - Equate rollerblade videos with advertising  Step 3 - Blame pro rollerbladers for being exploited by sponsors Step 4 - Provide examples of pro rollerbladers going outside of the industry to make money  So... Step 1 - AJ has consistently been producing quality videos for years Step 2 - Rollerblade videos are more than advertisements - They promote the products, bladers, and sport.  Furthermore, videos provide entertainment and inspire the audience.  The only real advertisements in rollerblade videos were in videogroove and they were in between sections.  I guess we shouldn't have paid for those either many years ago.  By you're logic, we shouldn't pay for any rollerblade video that has ever come out or will come out since they aren't anything but advertising. Step 3 - You can't blame pro rollerbladers for being exploited by sponsors and then turn around and give an example of a pro rollerblader not getting raped by his sponsor (Franky Morales).  Furthermore, Chris Farmer has his own pro skates and gets paid by the same company.  He is not getting ""ass-raped"" by his sponsor and I imagine that he is pretty content with his life. Step 4 - You undercut you're entire argument of ""pro's being ass raped by sponsors"" and ""making money outside of the industry"" by illustrating how Chris Farmer is turning to alternative methods for making money through rollerblading (VOD).  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY IT SO YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NOT GETTING FREE CONTENT.

rollerblading,38e8sh,doobiousone,2,Thu Jun 4 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"bahhhhh bahh bahhhhhhh VOD as it is today is lazy.  If it were a whole video, say 30+ minutes), it would be worth about $10 maybe 15. That is a big ""if"".  Taking your example of VG, VG showcased unsponsored talented skaters in every installment.  VG also had news and entertaining segments. The ads helped make the next installment which was different from the last.  And just for the record, many of us got the previous one for free when we bought skates from RW or TP.  I personally never paid for videos or t-shirts, they came free from the shops or grab bags at NISS or ASA. Under the current model the purchaser of a VOD gets told ""Seven minutes of AMAZING rollerblading"" but after purchase they get two minutes of skating and five minutes of stupid shit.  Who made the most money from rollerblading?  Aaron.  Why? He won contests and dropped killer street sections as well as marketed himself to outside companies like Levi's.  Fast forward to today and ""that redbull money is wack"".  What, are pros too cool to get paid now?  I buy skates, that's how I put my money in, I don't need to pay again because someone is too cool or lazy to find a way.  Also, I am not seeking free content.  I just believe that VOD is only doing the industry harm not helping poor pros.

You can't have it both ways.    Another point - If you are sick of how companies are run and feel that pro's are being lazy then do something about it besides complaining and taking money out of people's pockets.  Maybe....Start a company and put on demos and get kids interested?  All I see you doing is complaining about how the industry sucks and pro's being lazy.  Newsflash!  These are other peoples choices, not yours.  If you don't like them, go improve upon the problems you see instead of complaining.  At least AJ and Chris are out there putting out content and selling jeans.  If you did start a company and happened to be successful, you'd make a literal shit ton of money since companies are so poorly run and there are so many kids out there who could become bladers."

I have a pair of freestyles for commuting to and from university. Mine were a bit more expensive but they were the best 300 dollars I've ever spent. I've worn them for 6 hours at a time and no foot pain.  Make sure to get large size if you do."
rollerblading,3896mz,Angry_Onions,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:43:42 2015 UTC,What type of free style skate?  How are the wheels on this one? I usually wear a pair of black work shoes. They are comfy enough but they are lower cut. You think they would work well with these? The price is definitely right! But I'm also willing to pay more for a good skate :)
rollerblading,3896mz,Angry_Onions,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"I have freestyles by doop. They are the  next price point up from what I sent you.  I have worn boots that go to my calves as well as just normal vans with them and they both work fine, although the boots were not as comfortable. If the shoes you wear have thick soles then there might be an issue with stability."

rollerblading,385jlu,Travis_Stewart,7,Tue Jun 2 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'd just like to throw this out there. If you haven't backed the kickstarter yet, please do. This is bigger then just you. The game will never take off without the backing of the people in the industry like ourselves. Even if you back at the lowest level, or even just send them a fiver, do it for the greater good of rollerblading. If you have the funds, back to your hearts content. And if you back at the 10,000$ level, I will make you a promise to only ever play as your character. Haha. But seriously, this is a very defining moment for our sport. Sitting at #9 on Steam currently, and backed over 33% of the way already, we collectively have to push it to make it happen.  And Hopefully you can speak to this Jelle, but we will be getting that Pre-Alpha after funding is completed on any level over 100%? I personally can't wait!"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Tue Jun 2 00:34:55 2015 UTC,"Hey Travis,  Thanks for that little encouragement :). You assumed correctly, everyone who supports the Kickstarter campaign will get access to the pre-alpha version when the campaign reaches at least 100% of it's funding."
rollerblading,385jlu,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:43:04 2015 UTC,Best news ever.
rollerblading,385jlu,gu1d3b0t,5,Tue Jun 9 15:47:09 2015 UTC,How does it feel to know that your one-man Unity project is way cooler than all of mine?
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,5,Tue Jun 2 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"Can't really comment on that, because I haven't seen any of your projects :)"
rollerblading,385jlu,gu1d3b0t,2,Thu Jun 11 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"Well, either way it's awesome and your work definitely inspires me. Keep it up!"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm glad I could bring about a spark of inspiration :)"
rollerblading,385jlu,broskowfanboy,5,Thu Jun 11 20:46:07 2015 UTC,Would a Twitch streaming session be possible?    From playing many Early Access releases I know this helps people to be constructive when giving ideas. Seeing the game played with the Devs commentating is great for the community.    From watching live comps online I know there is a large number of people that would be willing to join and leave feedback. Have someone there to read the chat feed :)
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Sat Jun 6 17:25:39 2015 UTC,"I'll look into that! Though you're probably not going to believe this, but I don't have a webcam :). But I'm sure someone can lend me one."
rollerblading,385jlu,JawKneeCue,5,Thu Jun 11 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"Is the scale we see in the Pre-Alpha footage going to be the final scale of the game? By that I mean can we expect a Tony Hawks-esque dynamic whereby you can ollie over cars, drop endlessly etc or more like the Skate games, where your abilities are more in line with reality."
rollerblading,385jlu,summalummadooma,2,Tue Jun 2 11:04:30 2015 UTC,"This is a great question, was wondering the same."
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,7,Wed Jun 3 15:34:45 2015 UTC,the physics of the game or very much based on real life. You will not be able to jump over cars or anything unrealistic like that.
rollerblading,385jlu,raffraff89,3,Thu Jun 11 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"Hey. The game looks very impressive and you're clearly very commited to it. I hope you don't mind me playing devil's advocate.  The funding goal seems very small for this kind of ambitious project, especially when you talk about hiring more people. Do you have another significant source of funding that is making this possible? I ask because there has been a lot of talk recently about Kickstarter projects that don't reflect the cost of the project. Sometimes people wonder whether projects may be counting on being picked up by a publisher or counting on the funding going well over their initial goal. How would you respond to this?"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Tue Jun 2 17:21:38 2015 UTC,"Well one thing to take into consideration is that I've already been working on the game for quite a while and a lot of the basic mechanics are already in place, sure it needs lots of polishing, I'm confident I can do that in the short period that the minimum funding would buy me. Also if I were to only make the minimum funding goal I won't be able to hire more than 1 or 2 extra people for a few months. That's the idea. And of course I'm hoping to raise more than just the 50k, so I can make the game bigger and better :)."
rollerblading,385jlu,broskowfanboy,5,Thu Jun 11 18:34:13 2015 UTC,Do you have backing from any of the big names in rollerblading like Razors/Valo/USD? I'm sure they'd be willing. Jon Julio especially as he has an interest in games. He did make Bladin the game.
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,4,Fri Jun 5 12:20:46 2015 UTC,"I contacted pretty much every major rollerblading company out there, including Valo. So far I haven't heard back from a single one. But who knows they still might :)"
rollerblading,385jlu,broskowfanboy,3,Thu Jun 11 18:38:57 2015 UTC,Can I ask what the plan will be if we don't make the stretch goals? Do you think you'll be able to get funding from another source? I would love to see an object dropper and/or a park editor. I expect that will take a chunk of the budget though.
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Mon Jun 8 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"If I don't make the stretch goals, I'll try to look for other ways to raise more money, there's plenty. I really want to push this game to its full potential. An object dropper is the very first stretch goal and it's only $5000 extra, so chances of making that are pretty high. A level editor, that's a different story though, but who knows."
rollerblading,385jlu,sam_j_w,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:45:01 2015 UTC,We all want the game to reach its full potential as well!!
rollerblading,385jlu,meparadis,3,Thu Jun 11 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"Hey Jelle,  First, I just want to thank you so much for everything you've done with the game so far! I've backed it on Kickstarter AND voted for it on Steam. Glad loads of people are backing it as well.   I would like to ask you how is the multiplayer going to work?   I've seen on a discussion on Steam forums someone who was suggesting an IMYTA mode where you could ride oldschool spots from famous IMYTA competitions (Montreal, New-York, Paris, Amsterdam and more) against other players in a game of matching tricks that are in a list on the screen and I thought it would be an amazing idea. What do you think about this? How is going to be multiplayer in the game? Will it be ""cross-platform"" (ex: PC players and Xbox One players could play together)?  Also, I have a question about the controls. I hope you'll understand what I am trying to say but:    Will there be like different ways to do a trick by the way you press the joysticks or keys.  Like in skate 3 for example, when you pushed slowly the joysticks (instead of pushing them fast) the tricks were done much more smoothly and slowly. Will there be this kind of feature in the game or not since you can't really press slowly on a computer keyboard? Last question is about the Kickstarter campaign:  What will happen if the Kickstarter does not reach it's 50,000$ goal? Will we still be able to buy the game on PC with future updates? Will you be able to continue working on the game even if you did not get the Kickstarter money?   I truly hope this game will happen and once again, thank you!! Marc"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,4,Tue Jun 2 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"Hey Marc, Thanks for backing and voting on Steam :).  The multiplayer features are currently still in a very early stage. But some form of street competition will definitely be included, as well as trick matching games like B.L.A.D.E (basically the equivalent of a game of H.O.R.S.E in the old THPS games). Crossplatform, I'm not sure yet, hopefully we'll manage to do that.  Even if the game were only to be released for PC, I still recommend you get some sort of game controller similar to Xbox or PS, because the game relies heavily on analog sticks. At the moment the game does not respond to variations in input sensitivity, but it's definitely a good suggestion and I'll look into that :)  I'll see what I can do to finish the game if I don't make the funding, but the thing is. I need to be able to work full time on this project, because otherwise it'll take me years to finish it. So yeah funding is quite essential :)"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Thu Jun 11 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"Hello /r/rollerblading! Jelle from On a Roll here, I'm looking forward to answering any questions you might have for me on Thursday June 11th at 4pm (EST)!"
rollerblading,385jlu,buffcode01,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:14:08 2015 UTC,Verified account. Jelle will be answering questions from the account /u/jellevda_onaroll
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Wed Jun 3 15:32:44 2015 UTC,As a backer I'm very excited to play this game. I'm very happy that controls wise your going for a more organic style like Skate rather than Tony Hawks. I have a couple of questions. If you don't hit the required target will you release the game as early access on Steam? And will you include any old models of skates like the Roces Magestics and Oxygen AR for us old school skaters?! I hope the game has all the success it deserves.
rollerblading,385jlu,summalummadooma,3,Thu Jun 4 07:56:32 2015 UTC,"Early access definitely sounds like a good plan, now that On a Roll got greenlit, so probably yes, but like I said before, without any considerable funding, development might go very slowly.  Old school skates are something I hadn't thought of yet, but it's a great idea. As long as there are no copyrights preventing me from doing this, I don't see why not :)"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Thu Jun 11 19:27:50 2015 UTC,"Hi! So stoked for this game, backed it within the first hour on Kickstarter. Anywho, question: how extensive can we expect the character customization to be? Is there a game in particular with an editor you could compare to/are trying to model? Any chance of uploading photos of ourselves or something like that? And, what kinds of options will we have (clothes, face, bodytype, etc.), will there be updates for these as time progresses? Thanks!"
rollerblading,385jlu,sam_j_w,5,Thu Jun 4 15:28:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thanks for having faith in the project!  It'll be very similar to the one of the SKATE series, but a little more advanced on face editing. I feel like SKATE's face editing possibilities were rather limited. You'll be able to edit: body proportions, the face, skin color, all clothing, skates, wheels, bearings, hair, tattoos. Uploading your own logo or custom graphic will probably be an option as well. Though uploading a picture of your face is a bit trickier, because of the varying distance between facial features and also the varying lighting conditions. It won't be a first priority. Updates: sure if we feel it can/needs to be improved."
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Thu Jun 11 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"It looks like you are doing a great job with the game so far and rest assured I backed the game the moment the Kickstarter became available!  But have you contacted any publishers who could maybe help out with funding for the game and getting a bit more exposure?  I've wanted another rollerblading game ever since Rolling and Aggressive Inline (especially one more in the vein of Skate) and it seems like On a Roll is really starting to come together and it sounds like there are some really grand ideas that I am sure a lot of people would love to see realised. It would be a real shame if the game was dismissed as just a niche thing only for rollerbladers, as I believe that with the right exposure and funding the game could be incredible and do really well!  Many thanks and keep up the good work! I hope the game gets the funding it deserves."
rollerblading,385jlu,Vulgar_Slaughter,4,Thu Jun 4 17:09:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for backing and for the nice words :).  I have been contacted by an Indie game Publisher a few days ago, they seemed very interested in the game, though we haven't found the time to have a proper meeting about it. More on that soon though. One thing I've noticed is that people outside of the rollerblading community are also interested in the game. For some people it brings a feeling of nostalgia, others just like any kind of extreme sports game and there's even people who just dig it for the look and feel of it. So I think you're right, this can be bigger than just a niche thing for rollerbladers only."
rollerblading,385jlu,meparadis,2,Thu Jun 11 19:44:43 2015 UTC,"Will the pc version of the game include native support for xbox 360 or playstation 4 controllers?  Also, what kind of minimum/recommended specification are you looking at to run the game smoothly?"
rollerblading,385jlu,summalummadooma,2,Tue Jun 2 11:30:16 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it will since they said that we could play with controllers on our PC and it would be the same as if we were playing on a console
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Tue Jun 2 13:12:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in the FAQ it states you'll be able to use your controllers."
rollerblading,385jlu,broskowfanboy,2,Wed Jun 3 15:35:12 2015 UTC,Yes! There will be native support for Xbox and PS controllers.  System requirements: Intel core i5 2Ghz / 1GB HDD space / 4GB RAM /  GeForce GTX 460 or equivalent
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 19:47:56 2015 UTC,I can't wait. I've been following this game since the start. My hope is for a fluid control system. I'm sure we'll be pressing a button to jump and using the sticks to place feet. Maybe triggers to spin. Maybe holding the jump button for longer leads to a higher jump and a quick tap for a small jump. Much more realistic I think :)
rollerblading,385jlu,Harder_Tory,3,Tue Jun 2 22:33:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for following the game's progress!  You're idea about the controls is exactly the way it's been implemented :)
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 19:50:48 2015 UTC,"Backed!!! I cant wait to play this game! So juiced it was approved on Steam...You seem very committed and Im very excited to see what holds for the future! I dont really have any questions except, will there be a subreddit for the game? like /r/onaroll /r/playonaroll /r/onarollgame ..etc - id love to be apart of it. Best of luck! Ill be looking forward to playing!"
rollerblading,385jlu,TattyBill,2,Wed Jun 3 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"I'll look into setting that up, to be honest this is the first time I'm really using reddit for anything other then just reading through posts. But it's definitely a good idea!"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 19:52:33 2015 UTC,I would be really interested to know what program you are using to build the skateable level. I would love to help out if I can do depending on what program you are using.
rollerblading,385jlu,stahlballs,3,Thu Jun 11 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for offering your help! All environment pieces have been put together inside the Unity engine, but the models have been built in an external 3D modeling app. I'm not sure if I'll be able to afford a lot of extra help, but we can definitely discuss about this via e-mail: info'at'onaroll-studio.com"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you thank you for making this game.  It's been a long time coming and the fact that you started this yourself so you could play a new rollerblading game lets me know it will be amazing.    So, in some of the info surrounding the game the word ""creative"" comes up more than once.  I've also seen there is already some influence from mushroomblading.  I also noticed a still shot of a handplant on a flat rail.  So, I was wondering if you could offer us some insight as to just how far out of the box some of the tricks will go.    Here is a list of examples that I don't expect you to address entirely or at all. Grinds: sidewalks, top negatives, Christ grind, tabernacle, chain grinds?  cess slides: all variations, spins? walls: poll bonks, vertical stalls, wall cess slides, wall manuals? mushroom ect.: swivels, wall pushes, manual pivots, cork spins (like on a fire hydrant), pole swings  I will be fully pleased if the game is all standardized tricks, because there is still a lot of fun and creativity to be expressed there.  But I would be really stoked to see some ""circus tricks""."
rollerblading,385jlu,vesr,4,Thu Jun 11 18:53:38 2015 UTC,"At the moment I haven't implemented a lot of the creative/mushroomblading stuff, but it is on my schedule, my only concern is keeping the controls for all of that stuff fluent and intuitive. Pretty much all grind variations, cess spins, wall rides/slides/stalls even chain grinds, should be fairly 'easy' to implement, but don't worry I'll try to find a way to make it all work :)."
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 20:41:45 2015 UTC,Do you see any 'down the road' updates/DLC with the game if only the minimum goal is released? How do you pronounce Jelle?
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, though I would prefer to have it all in there at once, we'll see how it goes :).  My name is pronounced like the color yellow except at the end you replace the 'ow' sound with an 'a' as in the first letter of the word attention."
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for all of the typos I probably made. If I need to type fast, I often forget words or completely miss spell them :)"
rollerblading,385jlu,broskowfanboy,2,Thu Jun 11 20:51:34 2015 UTC,You've done fine! Thank you for joining us today Jelle! This has been very interesting and all of us from /r/rollerblading wish you the best of luck reaching and exceeding your funding goals!

rollerblading,385jlu,accidentalmachines,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just want to start off by saying thank you for making this game! I've been dying to play a new rollerblading game since my Aggressive Inline/Jet Grind Radio days..and to be so close to this being a reality is truly something special! Anyway, here are my questions:     1) Why did you choose On A Roll as your game's title, were there any other names in consideration? I have no issues with it, just curious!     2) Have you gotten in touch with any major websites to try to raise awareness for the game?     On my end, I've messaged IGN about the Kickstarter in hopes that they would be willing to post an article about it. I feel like there is a much better chance of that happening if you contacted them! Also, if any of you could spend a few minutes to do so as well I think it'll only help our chances. IGN Link     3) In regards to publishers, if you haven't been able to gain any backing from them before the Kickstarter...is there a chance a publisher has told you they would consider helping fund the game if the Kickstarter reaches X amount of backers or gains X amount of money?     I know there is a chance that if there is an answer to this question, you might not be able to discuss it...but it's worth a shot! With that being said...it sure would be nice if a company like SEGA, 2K, or EA decided to back this game. ;)     Also, I hope you don't mind but I posted about On A Roll on r/Kickstarter HERE."
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Wed Jun 10 08:23:22 2015 UTC,"Why thank you!  Hehehe well the title, I don't know, I just didn't want to go for anything to serious like 'Blade' or 'freestyle rollin' or something like that. The other title I'd been playing with in my head was 'Fruitbooting', but I didn't want people to feel offended, even though it was meant in a light hearted kind of spirit :).  I've contacted lots of major gaming websites, sent them press releases with an explanation, screen shots and links to footage etc. So far no response. From what I've learned it looks like you stand a much better chance if you actually know anyone personally who works for one of these magazines/websites. Unfortunately I have very little connections there, so if anyone is able to help me get in touch with someone on the inside, please let me know :).  About publishers as I mentioned in one of my earlier replies, I got contacted by an indie game publisher a few days ago, but due to busy schedules on both ends, we haven't been able to have a proper meeting. We'll see what happens!  I don't mind at all, feel free to post, blog and promote the game as much as you like :)"
rollerblading,385jlu,citizenkrans,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"First of, thanks for putting in the work - if this game goes mainstream, it could put some money back into rollerblading. Not that it matters for me, but it'd be dope if the pro's were able to live of being pro.  Anyways, questions.. Which brands will be included in the game? Will you be able to customize your skates, and if so - to which extent?  Any known faces going to be in the game? (Farmer, Haffey, Broskow and so on..)  And some quick yes/no questions for you..  Rough grinds? Handplants? Wallrides? Known street spots? Share-a-skater/skate? Online free skate? Action replay?  Thanks!"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,4,Wed Jun 10 09:32:28 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :)  I'm looking to include as many brands a possible, but it will depend on which brands are willing to support the game, it doesn't have to be much, but I'm sure buying a small ad for $500 won't hurt their business too badly :).  Yes skate customization will be possible! Everything from colors, to wheels, bearings, soulplates etc.  Hopefully there will be plenty of know faces, I contacted about 20 pro's including all of your examples, pretty much all of them were interested in being in the game, though I haven't been able to work out any deals yet, due to the high cost of motion capturing/3D scanning (+/- 4500 euros per rider).  Yes! All grinds, you can think of. Not all of them are currently implemented though!  Handplants, yes, but not yet implemented.  Wallrides: yes, already in the current prototype, but need some polishing  Probably not exact copies of known spots, but definitely parts of them or influences of them  Online free skate: yes!  Share a skater/Skate: maybe if I find the time :) Replays: yes"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"Hey, Jelle.   I'm bad at two things in life: rollerblading and video games. Thankfully, I've stuck with the former. Is there any level of the Kickstarter that has rewards for non-gaming bladers? Honestly, I want you to fully succeed and would love to contribute (it looks amazing!), but sending me a copy of the game would be a waste of both of our money. Y'all got a keychain or something?"
rollerblading,385jlu,TattyBill,2,Thu Jun 11 06:09:34 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I could add some rewards, for just a shirt/hoody, a button maybe? Good idea :) I'll look into that soon!"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,2,Thu Jun 11 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I just added some rewards that don't include a copy of the game. Cheers!"
rollerblading,385jlu,Norteaa,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:52:07 2015 UTC,"Ill start by saying thank you for what you have done so far,   Im concerned as you mentioned in one of your interviews already about the lack of pledgers compared to the amount of followers/likes you have on the Facebook page. Im concerned that we as a community are denying such a great opportunity to fund something that we have all be asking for for years.   If we dont make the funding is there anyway you could just sell the demo in its current form so that the people who actually want to fund this project can see a form of return.  (I for one would love to see you make the stretch goals. although it seems a long way off, I thought ou would of had more pledges by now.)"
rollerblading,385jlu,Largesaurus,3,Thu Jun 11 14:04:14 2015 UTC,"I totally understand your concern. It's been a little frustrating to say the least :). Especially since we could easily make all of the stretch goals if everyone on the Facebook page would just donate $15 or $20. I know I've said this many times and I don't want to be complaining all the time, because I really do appreciate all of the support I've been getting so far. One thing to take into account is that almost every single crowdfunding campaign follows a very typical curve, where you have a huge peak in funding at the beginning a very silent period in the middle end another peak at the end, so let's hope our campaign follows this curve :). Afterall we're already well on our way to 60%.  As I've mentioned in one of the answers above, bringing the game to Steam early access, will most likely be a good idea funding or no funding, so I'm not gonna be denying your fun :)."

I was wondering if I could paint a mural in the game?  I think it would be awesome if your game included some street art in it.  I'm not a developer so I don't know what it would take to make that happen or if it would be too much work but I figured I'd throw it out there anyways.  You can check out my work at www.NickNortier.com or follow me on Instagram @Norteaa  I backed your project and am incredibly excited to see this project come into fruition!  Best of luck!  Also, are you going to include some classic brands in the game such as FR or Senate?  Just curious."
rollerblading,385jlu,Largesaurus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:05:51 2015 UTC,"Hello, Jelle, I just wanted to say that the game looks incredible especially since this was all done by you up until now. This personal initiative of yours has the potential to make a huge positive impact for aggressive inline like no other single person has ever done in a long time (no pressure). Thank you for doing this for us all.  My questions are:   How is customization going to work? Are looking to partner with more skate hardware manufacturers to include their products and possibly take up some of those in-game advertisement spots? Any different mechanics for powerblading? I think it would be really cool if there was a skate cross option which mapped out race courses through a skatepark or even special maps just for races. Big wheels would be faster but it would be cool if players could still incorporate grinding into the race somehow(special shortcut maybe?) -but now I'm just dreaming stuff up. Aggressive skating is diversifying into other inline disciplines now and I think that should somehow be reflected in the game.  Will there be changing environments at all? Such as the option for day/night settings or rain which makes  surfaces slippery? Any level of interaction with objects like being able to kick a can off of a ledge mid-jump? Lastly I don't have another question but I would be really impressed if you could make this possible in the game.   Thanks again!"
rollerblading,385jlu,jellevda_onaroll,3,Thu Jun 11 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"Hey there, thanks for not putting any pressure on me hehe :)  The customization question has just been answered in one of the questions above :).  I haven't given too much thought about how to implement powerblading yet. It's definitely something that will be in the game though. There will certainly be some downhill parts, where I could easily incorporate some of your ideas, so thanks for that! Also been thinking about implementing some mushroomblading type of creative tricks, but those will be really difficult to map to some intuitive controls :).  Yes! The current prototype does not feature many interactive props yet, but it's somehting that's in the works. on top of the things you already listed I was also thinking of hinge gates to grind on, so you'll rotate along with the gate while grinding on it etc.  That's a pretty sweet cess slide, you got it, I'll put that in!"
rollerblading,385jlu,craftyanasty,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yes! So stoked. And for the skate cross stuff, I don't think any new maps need to be made at all, just a mode where a course is outlined through a skatepark area like this or this."
rollerblading,385jlu,youtubefactsbot,3,Thu Jun 11 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"Right, that won't be a problem. Would be a good idea indeed, I'm sure that might speak to an even broader audience with the skate cross feature. Thanks for the suggestion!"

You can adjust the frames.. just be careful... ease into the adjusted frames, make sure the bolts have loctite, use a ratchet (i think the bolts on seba frames are SAE rather than metric). I've fallen bad skating on adjusted frames due to the unfamiliarity while doing crossovers really quickly! ease into it  For inserts, you can try superfeet yellow. They are nice with Seba skates"

Post what video editing program you use, I'll send you a link to stabilization techniques.  Making a handheld video stabilizer can work wonders too. Good job adding lifestyle footage, but as a 31 year old man... You had me about two seconds from clicking close on your video with the snausage grabbing early in the video... Save the treats for the end.  Watch some of your favorite sections, and note what kind of shots you liked, and stood out to you... for your next video, try and recreate a couple of those.  Do more stable shots with a panning camera... that means bring a tripod.  Left to right pans (and vice versa) can look really nice if the footage is smooth and panned early... a trick i use is that I will put a rubber band on the handle of the tripod, and will use the rubber band to pull the camera along... it smooths out any bumbs or irregularities in your panning technique.  Good luck, good edit... look forward to more and BETTER. http://lifehacker.com/5977911/this-15-diy-dslr-stabilizer-rig-puts-an-end-to-shaky-cam-forever http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Track-Dolly-for-under-50/ http://petapixel.com/2011/07/14/stabilize-your-camera-footage-using-youtubes-video-editor/  I recommend you stabilize in your video editing program, instead of doing it in youtube, but it explains the concept."

rollerblading,383o98,studio_monster,14,Sat Jun 6 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"I think this question needs to stop being asked, now before anyone downvotes this please hear me out. It seems like a lot of people are waiting for the day to come along when some thunderous voice from the sky will make a proclamation finally saying that it's okay to rollerblade again.  The truth is it'll be a much slower process than that and with a whole lot less theatrics. But if you have to ask ""is rollerblading finally coming back"" the answer is probably no you just happened to see some outside attention given to the sport.  I said the same thing when those poorly written and meandering Vice articles were circulating through the rollerblading world over the spring. Rollerbladers in general didn't seem stoked because those stories were particularly representative of who we are and well researched informative pieces. Rather it was people getting excited purely because it was a mainstream publication running anything at all about rollerblading.  Once we're getting enough attention that the vast majority of bladers start feeling they have the luxury of evaluating the actual merit and value of the attention we get rather than just taking every slight nod of approval with pure unabashed joy, then maybe it'll be a strong sign that rollerblading is coming back.  Be patient, keep skating, and encourage your friends to get back on their skates but don't worry if blading is back or not because, while we can all agree it'd be pretty nice to have a money rich industry that retains talent and invests in itself, at the end of the day a lack of popularity didn't stop most of us from strapping on wheelie boots and neither will a resurgence in popularity."
rollerblading,383o98,doobiousone,3,Mon Jun 1 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"I've always thought something similar.  People had an idea for a while as if we would have our own Tony Hawk-esque rollerblading dominate the world thing. It happened to them, so it will happen to us. But that was some crazy phenomenon--something isolated and unique.  I stand by that, at least in the US, people will simply stop stereotyping blading so badly, and more kids will start trying it out as something different that looks fun. Basically, I'd agree that it isn't rollerblading's time to burst out and shine in some kind of grand festival, (""we did it guys! We're cool again!), but it does seem that more and more people are taking a general interest, or that the doors are finally opening to a more general curiosity again.  There have always been some really strong scenes that are still going to this day, so I'm happy."

Should add that I've just recently gotten back into it because my daughter loves to roller skate.  Was delighted to find they rent inline skates but appalled at the quality.

rollerblading,383o98,Johnmarmalade,2,Mon Jun 1 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"I think one of the best ways to increase exposure toward aggressive rollerblading is by encouraging other activities that revolve around rollerblading.  For instance, I initially began rollerblading around town for fun and eventually moved toward playing in a roller hockey league.  Eventually, I found aggressive rollerblading but that was after several years of blading around doing other stuff.  If aggressive rollerblading wants to grow the industry then other rollerblading industries have to grow with it or else it won't work."

It's just practice! Decide to dedicate half an hour to practice it at slow speeds each time you skate, if you had experience as a kid, you'll be great in no time!  Remember that the more pressure you put in the skate in the back (the one that breaks), the harder you'll break and it will also require more control to be stable.  Also, once you get good with that, practice power sliding. Once you are stable, it's MUCH easier then it looks. Again, practice slow at first.  Good luck!"

rollerblading,37u7vq,jjSuper1,3,Sat May 30 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"Well the key points of street skating would be:   Be very aware of your surroundings, as most people and vehicles would not be expecting to see an inline skater Complete stops are seldom necessary but just know how to do that or slow down or avoid collisions in case of some emergency Know how to handle uneven terrain and roll over cracks, stair riding is also very handy for city skating Know how to handle hills, slalom to shave off excess speed, and use grass when available as well   You should realize that a skater's stride takes up a much wider space than a bike does, so keep that in mind when passing people or when someone wants to overtake you. Coast along with your skates together or with one in front of the other to allow for space when needed, learning to propel yourself with very little lateral space is a very useful skill as well. You can do this by using just one skate to slalom left and right for propulsion and the other doesn't move.  For cracks in the road/sidewalk or speed bumps, skate over it with one skate slightly in front of the other and prepare your knees to absorb the shock. I'd say you should practice going over cracks because you can't avoid all bad terrain and it's best you know how to handle it when it comes.  You don't ever really need to come to a complete stop but you should know how to when you need to. Alternatively if you are about to get yourself in trouble you should know how to slow down to a safe speed or slow down enough for you to maneuver out of danger.  If you're going down a steep hill, you should ideally first know the hill before you skate it. Don't do any that are too steep for you or have heavy traffic and intersections along the way. To slow down it's a lot like skiing, you carve left and right so that you don't accelerate as quickly, but also use grass when available. You shouldn't be going full speed then bailing into the grass hoping all will go well because it won't. Just turn off to the side momentarily and skate a few feet in the grass to slow down, then turn back onto sidewalk/street.  Words don't really mean all that much in the real world though and you'd get best results from just going out there to get a feel for it. If you're not still flailing in panic at a crack in the sidewalk and are confident to a certain degree with most of those points I'd say you'd be fine on the streets. If you have more questions just ask, and don't ever underestimate hills."
rollerblading,37u7vq,Largesaurus,3,Sat May 30 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advise.  Right outside my house is a relatively flattish street, and the parking lot looks like several sharknados went through so there is plenty of cracks and terrible road to practice.   Stairs will likely come eventually, tho there are not really that many stairs to tackle in the city center.    I guess I just need to go do it."
rollerblading,37u7vq,-Hegemon-,3,Sun May 31 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"2 tips:  1) Learn how to break properly. You need to be able to break at any speed. If you can't, you'll never feel confident (and you shouldn't).  Skating has that problem, it's easy to go a much faster speed than you can break at. Practice the T break at low speeds, it's reasonably easy and can help at moderate speeds. For high, you need to be able to power slide.  2) Use protections, full set, including helmet. I've been skating for several years and seen a few accidents.  You'll feel much more confident with them."
rollerblading,37u7vq,thisismy20,2,Sun May 31 19:59:46 2015 UTC,Do you know how to brake? If not definitely learn. Theres a good way to slow your roll down a steep hill too by carving more instead of going a straight line if you've got the space.
rollerblading,37u7vq,TheDollarCasual,1 point,Sat May 30 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"I just started skating about 2 months ago, I've been teaching myself and skating exclusively outside on the street. It's not as hard as you would think, just start slow and build up your confidence. Practicing your turns and knowing how to stop (heel brake and/or T-stop to begin with) are great starting points if you haven't mastered those already, and will help you not to go too fast on the hills. Also, the more you encounter cracks in the road, manholes, bumps, things like that, the better you'll be able to adjust and soon your balance will improve so those things won't throw you off as much.  If you're going to skate outside a lot, it might also be worth looking into slightly harder wheels. I first started out on 78A wheels, recently I moved up to 84A which was a big improvement for the environment I skate in."

rollerblading,37p6ab,Potentcheese89,4,Fri May 29 08:33:25 2015 UTC,I've always thought it's where you spin into a trick looking over the shoulder opposite to your trick - I.e. you spin left looking over your right shoulder
rollerblading,37p6ab,DKSpizer,4,Fri May 29 10:33:12 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right. I don't believe that forward illusions spins are possible.   So if you are skating backwards, and looking over your left shoulder, typically you'd spin left. The illusion spin is looking over the left shoulder but spinning right.   The guy in the below video cheats it by switching to fakie right before he spins, but if you watch the slowmo part of it, you will see him looking left as if he was going to do a true spin (spinning left), he swings his head at the last second and spins right (alleyoop, right). The illusion part of it is when you lose complete track of the object, and fake people out thinking you are spinning the other direction. Video below has an illusion spin cab AO topporn (minus the quick turn to fakie).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbJ1Hb2ZMuQ"

rollerblading,37p6ab,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Sat May 30 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"Look over your right shoulder as you spin left or vice versa. It doesn't make any sense at all for a 180 and looks pretty dumb for everything else. All in sayin is that, technically, you can illusion forward"
rollerblading,37p6ab,adamcognac,1 point,Sun May 31 07:20:49 2015 UTC,"I get what you are thinking--that I could be approaching a trick on one side but look away from the ledge but that is more an illusion about what I'm skating than the spin direction.  Hear me out.   Our face and eyes are on the front of our body and do not have to look around anything to see forward.  Fakie becomes a little more difficult because we have to look around our neck. There is not an instance with a fakie trick where you are completely looking AWAY from the trick--that's just silly. Illusion or regular, you are looking at the obstacle just illusion you are bending your head around the shoulder that indicates the different direction than you are going to spin.   Anyhow, you don't have two options to look at an obstacle going forward because you don't have to look around something (your neck)."
rollerblading,37p6ab,aldolega,1 point,Sun May 31 14:36:55 2015 UTC,"The name comes from, if you do it correctly, it looking like you spun more than you did- i.e. an illusion 3 looking more like a 540.  Also, in my opinion, you have to be both looking over the ""wrong"" shoulder AND in the ""wrong"" fakie stance/stagger for it to really count, IMO. I see a lot of fake illusions where people are in the proper fakie stance/stagger, and just switch their shoulder. NUH UH BUDDY!"

rollerblading,37lq9u,Travis_Stewart,2,Thu May 28 19:44:41 2015 UTC,Getting your game on consoles is a ton of aggravating work. I wouldn't be surprised if it never happened and I think it's very smart of them not to promise specifics.
rollerblading,37lq9u,gu1d3b0t,0,Thu May 28 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"Actually it isn't. Porting in Unity (which is the platform) is super easy. the tools are there, and within a few hours, you can typically have it running. I've made some unity ports in the past, and they really are that easy.  Rereading your comment (i'm on a fucking roll today with these ones...), the real aggravation comes from dealing with the consoles on getting it published. Not the porting."
rollerblading,37lq9u,Travis_Stewart,2,Thu May 28 23:17:45 2015 UTC,"I know, I'm a Unity dev too. But even with Unity porting is never as simple as just hitting a button. You've gotta test it all over again, and no doubt optimize things per-platform when something breaks, or the target platform isn't as powerful. Not to mention getting your hands on the hardware itself to test on."
rollerblading,37lq9u,gu1d3b0t,1 point,Thu May 28 23:24:52 2015 UTC,True. But it better then it was in the past hand coding everything over again and remapping everything. Even from previous iterations of Unity. The new unity is pretty slick.

Now that its a mature, saturated market there really isn't much room for growth. I'm gonna switch out of the industry at some point. Probably not soon, but someday.  Although Unity can be used for non-game simulators, so in that sense its still extremely valuable.  Anyways, can't wait to see what they come up with."
rollerblading,37lq9u,Sc0mbridae,1 point,Fri May 29 00:04:35 2015 UTC,I personnaly prefer gaming on a PC but I also think that they should also includes consoles versions for their Kickstarter. There are way more consoles players than PC gamers and I feel like lot of people are going to restrain themselves from backing the project because of that. Having a good PC for gaming is kinda expensive and a console only cost like 400$... I just hope the Kickstarter is going to work out us and them!

rollerblading,37lq9u,Largesaurus,1 point,Fri May 29 01:36:43 2015 UTC,This poll looks pretty rigged to me lol... I mean Stephanie Richer is good but how could she be first along with Abrate...?! Just want to add that these two are good friends as well... Pretty strange eh?
rollerblading,37lq9u,meparadis,2,Fri May 29 13:43:06 2015 UTC,Well I don't think so because when I first checked it at around 198 votes Stephanie was at 2%. Each vote she gets means everyone else's percentage of the total votes decreases slightly. Maybe she just has friends telling others to go vote there? It would be very cool to have more female pros represented in the game. Who are you voting for?

rollerblading,37n8kw,NostalgiaSchmaltz,1 point,Thu May 28 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"Invest in a better pair of blades than what you will fine in a big box store. Even the k2 il capo would be a great option. Comfortable, great bearings and wheels, and it's UFS so if you want to get some aggressive wheels and frames you have that option as well. The RB fusions have this same option, but will require minor drilling to attach the soul plates."

rollerblading,37n8kw,Vandebe,1 point,Fri May 29 02:27:47 2015 UTC,Not a bad choice. Personally I would be concerned with overpowering that she'll. I stride really hard and I'm 220lbs so it's common for boots to feel kinda weak to me. Seba has a great line of inexpensive boots in their FR line. Inline warehouse usually has a good price on them.

I only do city or trail skating, anywhere from 5-20 miles at a time, and have been using K2s for the last 10 years. Very comfortable. I'd consider getting a skate with larger wheels though, maybe 90s. It took very little time adjusting from 72mm hockey skates to 90s and then from 90s to a hi lo 100/90 set up. They ride faster and smoother."
rollerblading,37n8kw,-Hegemon-,1 point,Sat May 30 02:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had K2 skates when I was younger, and I remember them being good. That guide I read suggested using 90-100mm wheels for fitness/long distance skating; the ones I'm looking at on Amazon are only 78mm though.  Also not quite sure what size I should be getting. Googling around, most sites say that in general, your shoe size = your skate size. I wear size 12 shoes, so should I get size 12 skates?"

rollerblading,37kmnm,limitlessbad,1 point,Thu May 28 09:10:35 2015 UTC,"Just got my VO2 100 X BOA today, which should have the same boot as the FIT 84.  For me they are a small bit on the big side (usually got size 45, got 44.5 with the K2). Otherwise the fit is pretty much perfect, with a snug secure fit at the ankles while still allowing motion forwards and backwards. The Boa system also works very well for me.   Only issue which bothers me is the construction quality. Glue spills are visible at many places and the seams don't seem to be very well done at the edges."
rollerblading,37kmnm,InValidFacts,1 point,Thu May 28 09:21:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I am using U.S. sizes and would normally wear a size 11 running shoe. I was going to go with a size 10.5, so half a size under the norm. Half a size under for U.S. sizes should be more a difference than what you got, so I'm hoping that will make up for any large sizing."
rollerblading,37kmnm,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Thu May 28 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"This is a perfectly good skate for an intermediate skater looking to get in some fitness/rec skating.  As far as fit goes, K2 generally runs true to size so if you wear a mens size 8(US) you would want to order a size 8 skate.  When it comes to comfort thats where k2's really shine. It just doesn't get much more comfortable than a soft boot skate and the speedlacing B.O.A. system is meant to eliminate pressure points in the boot. If you're unfamiliar, here's a short video showing exactly how it works. This happens to be on a snowboard boot but it's the same principle.  The 84's have an aluminum frame which can house wheels up to 90mm so when you get more comfortable skating again and eventually wear out the stock 84mm wheels there's room to grow if you'd like to step up to a larger wheel."
rollerblading,37kmnm,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Thu May 28 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"On several of the selling sites and in some of the skate guides I had read it was said to buy half a size lower than your running shoe size in order to achieve a more fitness-type feel. Furthermore, they mentioned that because of the soft boot, which I have never used before, that after a while they would break in and end up giving a little more space anyways, so the half a size could again help keep the boot from becoming too loose.  How do you feel about this? Do you believe I should buy my true size or a half size under?"
rollerblading,37kmnm,jdowpcs,1 point,Thu May 28 17:37:31 2015 UTC,"K2 sizing guidelines support what I said, they are true to size.  K2 Inline Skates are manufactured to men's and women's specific foot lasts. They fit true to your measured U.S. shoe size in an average width. As proper fit is of great importance to comfort, be sure to try on your skates before use, whenever possible. When making an online purchase, K2 recommends ordering true to measured shoe size for K2 Skates, assuming an average width foot. If you have a wide foot, we recommend purchasing one half size over measured to accommodate volume.  For more information: click here."
rollerblading,37kmnm,jdowpcs,1 point,Thu May 28 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"I owned some K2 FIT 80 Boas that were good - they were my first pair back on the scene before I went into more freestyle/freeride skating. One thing to note is that one of the strings on the boa system broke after maybe 8 months on mine (of pretty heavy use) but I was yanking on them kinda hard. Just be careful on those.  Take the brake off when you're comfortable. K2 will ship you a spare axle that fits where the brake used to be for free, you just have to call them for it."
rollerblading,37kmnm,kub0n,1 point,Thu May 28 15:58:48 2015 UTC,"I know how the boa system works, but I don't know much beyond that since I've never actually used it and only seen it used.   When the wire broke were you able to replace it? If so, how much of a hassle was it?  One of the reasons I was drawn to K2 was because several people said they were willing to replace faulty skates or send parts to fix the skates free of charge. I was actually thinking about removing the brake after a few months in, so thanks for that info."

rollerblading,37h8r9,Youso,2,Wed May 27 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"The issue is how Sellfy deals with the content. It's not supported on mobile. He puts that out there and up front because the product is limited to 5 downloads before you have to buy it again, and he gets super negative emails every time he does this because of the platform that they sell on and the general ignorance of everyone to how it all actually works. It's not AJ's choice. Its a hosted file and most mobile devices can't handle a raw 550+mb h.264 file. I believe on Android it will download, but you'd need VLC player to play it back (because of the H.264 codec), but on iOS, it will stream download, and each time you play it back, it counts against the total 5 downloads you have. I also believe due to the structure of iOS, if you leave Safari, or lock the device while its downloading, it can generate a new cookie, and reset the download counting against your total once again.  TL;DR - It's not an AJ choice, it how shit works. Download it on your computer or possibly buy it twice."

rollerblading,37h8r9,Morbidgrass,2,Wed May 27 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.  The way I see it, we're not paying five dollars just for the content but to support the rollerblader and company so that they can keep blading, coming out with product/edits, and exposing the greater world to rollerblading culture.  The rollerblade economy needs dollars to function and VOD may be an efficient way of getting money to the companies and bladers that need it most while coming up with new content.   TLDR - I happily spent five dollars today.

Perhaps try insoles with good arch support such as Superfeet Yellow  You could align the frame laterally if your skate has speedskate-style mounting bolts (I doubt they do because fitness skates are usually poop about that)  Get a better fitting boot if necessary or go for a more supportive skate with better ankle support (hardboot preferred)

rollerblading,37ecev,yayu10,4,Wed May 27 00:30:38 2015 UTC,"A 360 in any scenario is when your body spins 360 degrees before or after contact with either the ground or a grind.  How you spin AFTER a grind is like a new spin. 180 on/180 off. 360 on/360 off.   If you 360 on to a ledge and 360 off it is not considered a 720 grind but a 360 grind with a 360 off.  To come off a true mizou ""away"" from the ledge would be considered a rewind or revert because you are spinning OFF the ledge in the opposite direction that you spun ON to the ledge.  Hope that helps."

When you go back to skating (and I just think in the end you won't be able to resist, I mean that's like choosing not to fly if you know you can...), how about joining a group of skaters who do routes around your city together? If Milan is like other European cities, I'll bet there are a bunch of different groups that meet in different places and skate around together. You'll feel safer around other skaters and best of all, people will get out of your way when you are in a pack."

rollerblading,37bf1j,footninjaarcher,2,Wed May 27 01:33:22 2015 UTC,"i had to get my knee scoped due to my skating injuries.  Although i skated aggressively for about 8 years.  I was skating when people were sitting on their soul foot.  Which puts a hell of a lot of strain on your knee.  It took a while to build my knee up to where I could be physical again.  However, I changed my mindset and took a different approach to skating.  Instead of huge gaps and crazy grinds, I stuck with easy brings and riding transition at parks.  Basically, my extreme days were behind me. For you it could be different.  You might be young and can bounce back. I got hurt at 20-21 and decided it was time for me to retire.  left the crazy game that was evolving to the next generation ."

The thing is, you can still skate at a leisurely pace and progress at a slower, more safe rate, but for me the feeling of reward is strongest when youre overcoming your fears. I've been skating for years and most of it has been aggressive and trick skating, so our experience's will vary, but I guess my point is that you never have to stop skating. Sometimes you just need to take a step back, slow your progression and find your comfort zone before your prepared to push it. Your comfort zone might be smaller now after the injury, but that doesn't mean you can't slowly begin to expand your skill set again and re-live the glory of making progress, no matter how small or gradual it may be."

rollerblading,37998o,Shyrobot,7,Mon May 25 22:29:16 2015 UTC,"Firstly, put all your pads and a helmet on, hip pads may save your ass in this case.  As you may have already done, start from the bottom of the vert/bowl and make sure you can skate all the way to the top back and forth without too much effort.  If you can get yourself so your body is over the top of the lip of the vert/bowl then this is the same feeling as dropping in.  Ideally, stall the edge. When skating in the vert/bowl, get yourself to the top and turn 180 degrees so your back is facing the outside of the vert/bowl then put your skates in a position so that the space between your middle wheels (or just the centre of your gap) is on the edge/coping (This is called a Backside Stall). You can start by tapping it but you really want to put your weight on the edge evenly with both feet for a moment.  If you can get comfortable with this ""tapping"", start putting more and more weight on the edge by pushing your momentum out of the ramp towards the platform at the top of your arc. Keep pushing this until you have your entire body weight on the edge/coping.  At this point you are doing exactly the same thing as dropping in.  You can spend as much time as you like doing this over and over until you can do it without thinking about it.  When you feel comfortable with this then you can think about dropping in from the top without it feeling alien.  (You may already have most of this in your head but to be clear) Dropping in for the first time is usually done by standing on the edge of the ramp (facing into the ramp) with your feet side by side, shoulder width apart.   Shift your weight forward to lean into the ramp and as you do so, bend your knees to a half crouch, as you go over the edge your weight and position should be almost completely Perpendicular (90 degrees) to the ramp surface (literally standing on a wall). You will feel your wheels let go of the edge/coping, try to keep them on the surface. If you lean back at this stage (the normal human instinct) you will fall on your ass (ALWAYS better to fall forwards than backwards). As you roll/fall forwards (hopefully with all your wheels still in contact with the ramp) begin the lean back (always with your weight centered forward of the vertical) with the curve of the ramp and as you do straighten your legs slightly without ever actually straightening them fully (that would be bad - do not fully straighten your legs EVER when staking, unless at a complete stop).   That is the basic gist of it.  Let me know if you need any more help with this or if I was not clear with any of this. It's a pretty simple action but it goes against many human reflexes. The physics can sound confusing but it all makes sense once you get it in your head."

rollerblading,37998o,ultimomono,1 point,Sat May 30 04:22:44 2015 UTC,"I watched my son go through this not too, too long ago. His solution was to skate over the coping with two feet, tip himself forward with bent knees and fall in. It was ugly and everyone looked at him like he was crazy because it's so much easier to trip that way, but I think this worked from him, because there was no turning back after he got up a certain amount of speed.  Later he skated to the edge and jumped in. Finally he learned to drop in by standing on the edge, which seems to be the easiest, safest way to go about things, but looking down into the bowl really freaked him out. (Not that I would suggest doing things in this order at all--just to say that getting over your fear and getting a few tries under your belt is really the key.)  All of this took him months to get right. I've seen other kids get their skates on the first day and just jump right in. We all have a different relationship with fear and fearlessness. It helps to wear a helmet and pads so you don't have to actually worry about killing yourself. Worst that can happen is you land on your ass."

I go mostly to this park, because it's close to where I live:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLL1acMKhzVr1SqLLx-3kKA  It's a bit cramped and way too crowded when clueless parents drop their rugrats in there on weekends, but if you go while kids are in school, on hot/cold days, and during lunch or after 10pm on the weekends, it's practically empty."

The Shooters are slightly softer and will wear out more quickly, but they definitely skate very well.   For bearings, you can't beat the bag of 100 bearings for $40 on Ebay.

rollerblading,370ohz,Snick803,6,Sat May 23 19:43:16 2015 UTC,"Different leg muscles feeling worn out should be normal since you probably haven't been using them as you do in inline skating, but if it persists something's not right. The muscles at the shins lift the foot upwards(toes up) which isn't a movement utilized as much as pressing the foot down, which is why there's such a difference in muscle mass between the calves and the shins, which have almost none between the skin and bone.  Your skates should not be tilted outwards to the ground, it's common for new skaters to sort of waddle around on skates, but this is not good form and you should try to eventually get to the point where you can bring your foot back underneath you to as close to vertical as you can after each stride. Proper skating form also involves a slight crouch and you should be bending more at the knees and not hunching over completely at the hips. Good form comes with practice.  Skates should fit well at your size(but you should know that some different manufacturers do size their skates a little differently) and not have an extra half-size of empty space in them. It sounds to me like you need to check how you lace up as well. If your toes are hitting the front and your shins are doing extra work to lift the foot and skate from the toe end at each stride you should be making sure that your skates are laced up tight so that your feet are secured in properly, with the heel locked in its place. If your heels are locked in properly the foot will share the work of moving and lifting the skates better across the foot than when your heels lift off and they just hang off the front end your feet when you raise a boot.  It could possibly be because the K2 Boa lacing system is unconventional but I've heard that they allow you to tighten up very well so just tie it harder.  This should help with most concerns and but just ask if you have more."
rollerblading,370ohz,Largesaurus,3,Sun May 24 01:28:53 2015 UTC,What's your average pace? If you're logging your recreation it's always worth looking at your pace. Just about every cardiovascular activity will give you issues if you don't ease yourself into it. I skate one a week and walk for work and still have trouble if I go too hard suddenly (Sprint/run). Give it a rest for a bit and when you feel better give it a gentler go.
rollerblading,370ohz,NPC82,3,Sat May 23 20:09:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anybody point that out in the comments but if you just started skating, maybe you're a little scared to fall and the fear makes your body tense.

However there are some pointers which can help train your technique so you get better quicker.  Stretch your hips good, the outside (eg glutes) and inside (eg psoas, adductors, illiacus). Everyone forgets the inside hips but if those are tight then your hips will be fowards-set, throwing the lower posture off and putting more strain on your back, glutes, etc.  edit: found this video. Especially important if you sit all day.  When skating your force should go straight down the wheels instead of  the inside or outside.  Make sure your feet don't slide laterally inside the skate.  This will cause the skate to lean towards one side, usually the ankle angling inward.  Try to stand straight without leaning forward.  If your balance is on your toes then your center of gravity is shifted too far forward.  Rang of Motion exercises are a great way to warm up.  Swinging your legs, rotating your waist, and other such exercises help get the blood moving and the muscles warm."

rollerblading,3714rs,Johnmarmalade,2,Sun May 24 02:57:05 2015 UTC,I had a pair of snowboarding boots with a similar clip. you're supposed to slide it up the laces to make them snug rather than tying them. You should be able to tuck/hook the extra lace under the power strap. There should be a switch type thing on it that you can slide forward that will let you pull them loose again.  Edit: Here's a beautiful pic I made for you
rollerblading,3700cs,sprinkles123,2,Sat May 23 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"Micro jump into banks to avoid catching your antis. Also practice catching them and smoothly roll into the bank at the same time, this will help when you make an error and it will save you.   If your going up a bank and loose speed and are struggling to make it up pull some invisible ropes, somehow this works and will get you over. Skate backwards as much as possible and try to learn by taking turns looking over each shoulder and switch to going backwards both directions. Ie: pivot 180 to the left looking over right shoulder, pivot to the right looking over left shoulder.  Just realized my keyboard wasnt on english so sorry for all the typos"

rollerblading,3700cs,gypsyblader,1 point,Sun May 24 06:38:55 2015 UTC,Thats most likely because you are pointed your toes or heels so your legs spread in and out.keep your feet parallele and it should work.  God dammit I had my french keyboard on again
rollerblading,3700cs,Tunes_,1 point,Sun May 24 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"I broke my hiatus going straight into it with anti-rockers, so I don't know how different it feels, but I also have the razor genesys. I've noticed when I'm turning I do more of the cross-over maneuver. Sometimes if you're doing this your grind plate will touch the ground, you'll get used to where it is eventually. Turning without doing the cross-over gets harder with the more speed you get, i'd only do it if you're going at a slower speed or are doing a really wide turn."
rollerblading,3700cs,Largesaurus,2,Sun May 24 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"I definitely do the cross-over maneuver as well, it just feels smoother and keeps the speed.   I've started learning how to lean into turns more, it definitely helps to keep the cuff just a little loose so the skate can move a bit more freely for turns"
rollerblading,3700cs,Vandebe,1 point,Sun May 24 06:41:58 2015 UTC,"It's easiest to turn when you lift the toes up a bit on the foot that is on the inside of the turn. So when turning right you lift lean into it as you normally would and while having the right foot slightly in front of the left foot just lift the front wheel of your right skate off the ground. You're then going around the turn with you right heel leading your left skate, this can make you turning radius a lot tighter. It's become a habit of mine and I do that for a lot of my turns now. Cross-overs are good too and you can even accelerate yourself in a turn when doing cross-overs.  The frames were designed to lock in on grinds but if you want to avoid catching on transitions and stairs then you can either momentarily lift your weight as you come over it without entirely jumping so that you can roll over it(it also helps to have one skate slightly in front of the other in this situation), or just do a jump/mini-hop."
rollerblading,3700cs,CaptainObviousSpeaks,2,Sun May 24 01:47:39 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, I guess it always seemed like I need to have all 4 wheels on the ground at once. Lifting the toe is such a good idea, I'll try that tomorrow for sure.  Jumping the lip seems comfortable, let's see how long it takes before I can jump into ramps hueheh  Thanks for the tips, dude"
rollerblading,3700cs,CaptainObviousSpeaks,1 point,Sun May 24 06:44:18 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion. You should be skating flat, with the biggest wheels you can fit in the frames. Valo frames are cheap as hell and will fit an61mm wheel flat. Right now I have USD classic thrones with valo frames, and flat undercover dual density wheels. They are 58mm, but I am used to how they feel and know what I need to do to get more sped with the smaller wheels. The turning aspect will take time to feel out with the smaller wheels and chunkier frames, but with time will become second nature."
rollerblading,3700cs,CaptainObviousSpeaks,0,Sun May 24 12:57:47 2015 UTC,if you are more comfortable with four wheels just go with a flat setup.  the main downside is that it will be harder to land in the grind.   Pick your feet up more after you push.  the anti-rockers and grind plate are supposed to catch the lips to help you land in a grind.  the flat setup will help with that.  I would just hop the lip or step over it.

rollerblading,36x3a5,Warkid1993,3,Fri May 22 22:12:40 2015 UTC,"Try to sketch your foot on a white piece of paper and measure in cm the length between heel and the big toe.

This usually works for me :)  but yea, try to call the store for info on return policy... make sure you dont scratch them before returning them of course :p   I should note, Roces M12 are pretty cheap and skate awesomely with my kizer powerblade frames (lvl 3, 72mm) but they have pressure spots with the stock liners and the liners rip easily (i am using spec ops trust liners now)... if you have large ankle bones/protruding archers, maybe stay away from Roces M12!

rollerblading,36s5po,DimSumLee,1 point,Thu May 21 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"Generally you'll want a hardshell boot for any significant skating (not least because you can wash the liner), or at least one that gives more support than any of these three will; but with your budget in that region you won't find anything new. If you're going to skate a lot or are serious about it put in the extra $100 for a proper hard-shelled Seba, RollerBlade, PowerSlide etc. - hell, even Roces.  Anyway, onto your actual question...  Presumably the Igniters are the old version of the RB Formula line, in which case they'll be standard RB frames, break pads, etc. and you can decide if you want standard 80's over the 82mm wheels they come with. They're budget ones for sure, but all the common tools will work, no problem getting replacement parts, etc. etc.  Personally I'm not a fan K2's as there is often a bit too much 'give' (stretch) in the boot itself. Although to be fair this affects all soft-boot skates, just K2's a little more than others in my personal experience. Ultimately this means you loose a little control and they'll feel different after a few months (for me this means I over tightened them a lot after a few weeks and found it hard to get the right fit without having to adjust them part way through a session). That said, K2 are a reasonably common and perfectly usable, maintainable skates - so I doubt you'd go far wrong with them.  Firefly Lithium - never heard of these. No idea."

I had the Nemesis back then which were the Red/White model that came out at the same time as those Transfers. Very comfortable skates but way too bulky for my tastes.  Be sure to stretch before you skate. You'll be surprised how unconditioned your body has become to blading. Being sore the day after a session just means you're getting back into the swing of things. Keep at it and you'll be fine.
rollerblading,36kpzo,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Wed May 20 03:24:43 2015 UTC,Skated just a bit last night and i can already feel it in my legs. Definitely gonna need to strech next time lol.

rollerblading,36kpzo,myusernamesalwayssuc,2,Wed May 20 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"Since it sounds like there's no skatepark by you ATM you'll have to find ledges you think you can practice on. First day is all about figuring out your balance, stopping, turning, going backwards. If that comes natural to you then work on stalling the classic grind positions on a curb. Get in the habit of jumping with both feet into your stall if you're comfortable enough with it. Once you're locking your stalls on curbs, try it on a slightly higher ledge. When you're ready get some wax, find a nice ledge, and start turning those stalls into grinds!"

rollerblading,36k1dw,jjSuper1,2,Wed May 20 00:50:54 2015 UTC,"5000   Sounds a bit low.  Assuming a rail is 1M high (~3ft 2""): 75Kg * 9.81m/s/s * 1m = 672.084J.  Assuming the skate and liner provides for 0.015m of deformation you're talking about 45KN (which, actually sounds reasonable).   Over 4 bearings you're looking at an average 12KN or so (although likely it won't be even, thus you're probably looking at about 20KN loading for a bearing)  Your body absorbs the force a lot better as you deform a lot better than your rigidly modelled skate system above (i.e. you decelerate over 25cm or so by bending your legs as you land). The force your body absorbs is nearer the 3000-5000N mark*, but your bearings are taking ten times that.  ... of course, I've done done any physics calculations since high school, so I could be totally wrong. If you know better please explain ;)  * - perhaps you've confused that above with the force applied to your bearings? - I.e. impact forces on you ~5000 but nearer 50,000 on your skates. You are nothing like a rigid system (you'd shatter bones if you were at that impact) - your skates are... much closer ... to one."

The big flaw in the design being that the ball bearing spacing only remains constant if the bearing isn't under shock. Any systems where shocks are coming in regularly will destabilize the spacing and lead to premature wear.   For systems where rotation is at steady state for the vast majority of the time, this sounds great. I'm thinking jet turbines, and generators. Anything in a really dynamic application, like skates and cars, won't use this."
rollerblading,36k1dw,Reelbk,1 point,Wed May 20 04:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you're right. I saw some talk of external vibrations being a potential issue in the comments of an article that picked up this video so that would be a deal breaker for rollerblading but honestly I won't ever claim to be an expert on any subject except rollerblading itself.  I thought this was an interesting video though because we all spend so much time on our bearings. It's certainly cool, but this is what the ""unrelated"" flair is for! Interesting posts that don't necessarily relate directly to rollerblading."
rollerblading,36k1dw,Reelbk,2,Wed May 20 05:41:27 2015 UTC,"No worries, it's a cool and pretty relevant post IMO. I enjoyed the vid, it's just the engineer in me that wanted to think aloud."
rollerblading,36k1dw,ismtrn,2,Wed May 20 11:36:08 2015 UTC,"My bearings can free spin forever too if you wash the oil out. I can't comment on the rest of it, but the parts were they show that it spin longer doesn't really show anything."
rollerblading,36k1dw,NEVERDOUBTED,4,Wed May 20 12:51:09 2015 UTC,"This is a joke...right?  Just because the balls don't touch doesn't mean that you can get away with not runny a lubricant.   The grease is needed because you have steel-to-steel contact once a load is applied to the bearing. Cage or no cage, doesn't change that.   And the reason why the one on the right is spinning so freely, by comparison, is because it has no grease. Take just about any high performance bearing, with a heavy race (such as these) and remove all the grease and it would spin nearly just as free. One of great reasons for running a thin oil vs. grease in human powered performance applications, (bikes, skates...etc.).   Also keep in mind that when a load is applied to a ball bearing assembly such as this, only a small amount of the balls are carrying the load. So...if you put a grove in there that slows and then speeds up the bearing, you are most certainly going to create a point where the load is greater, causing premature wear. Not to mention that it would cause a distortion. You can't change the ID without throwing everything else off.   They are fixing something that doesn't need to be fixed...and this makes no sense. So...I really do think it might be a weird joke of sorts."

rollerblading,36j4cm,lDustDevil,1 point,Wed May 20 01:24:02 2015 UTC,"Look at the kizer slimline 2 frames. Now look at GC Featherlite 3 Frames (normal ones). Do you see the difference with the rocker wheels? The Featherlite frames shape an ""U"" with the rockers where you stay locked in at H-block grinds. The kizer slimline frames don´t have that. In my opinion there will be no difference if you take the rocker wheels out or let them in as they don´t help with anything. Groundcontrol Bigs are far better --> get 4 wheels on each frame and you'll roll like Jesus over water."

rollerblading,36jo3i,alksdjfd,1 point,Thu May 21 21:59:25 2015 UTC,"changing wheels is easy, just use an allen key. some frames you need to use 2 allen keys, one on each side. If you're upsizing your middle wheels to a flat set up just get the same wheels that you have on the outside so that they're all the same size. Riding flat will make grinding harder though, depending on what frames you have it can make it ALOT harder. if you have the stock frames like in this picture I would stick to an anti-rocker setup if you still want to grind on your h-block"

rollerblading,36hpz6,chowaniec,3,Tue May 19 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"I'm recently relearning how to rollerblade after a 10 year hiatus. I was trying to get used to doing the small rail at my local park (rails scare the shit out of me). I was successfully locking grinds to my surprise, so I decided to try each grind to get used to the feel of it.  I did a pornstar on it, my back leg slipped out and I landed directly on my ribs.  They still hurt and it was 4 days ago! Not sure if I fractured them or it's just internal bruising, but this is why rails scare me so much. :'(  Also on the same day I bent half my nail backwards after slipping out of a grind on a box. It wasn't a very good day.  Other than that I've been making great progress! I wasn't much of a grinder when I used to skate, so I've definitely surpassed my skill level in that department, which feels great!  PS. I still have no clue how to do top tricks, or how to make my frontsides into nice looking royales. They just seem to hurt."
rollerblading,36hpz6,Tunes_,2,Tue May 19 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"I have been there with the cracked ribs, and right when I was starting work too -- shitty as hell, but always the motivation to get better! For top tricks, practicing on a rail seems key. I'm not the best person to confirm this though as I have been making h-block tricks a higher priority. With royales, it is all in the shifty and back kneee. Lock on crouched & look sideways toward the end of the obstacle and your back leg will assume the position easier."
rollerblading,36hpz6,bladedvox,2,Tue May 19 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I guess i'm going to have to hold off on the top tricks for now, I really don't want to further the damage on my ribs. Knowing my luck i'll land on the exact same spot!   I'll try that out for the royale, it's definitely my top priority trick to learn right now. If you do it right do you still get pressure in your ankle / the top of your boot?"

If you're still walking and working etc, you're probably just bruised and not cracked or broken. My first time, I went to the hospital thinking they were cracked because after 2 weeks I was still in pain, but the x-ray was clear. Give yourself time to rest, and keep skating!"

I started slalom about 2 years ago, on my old fitness skates I've got for about 4 years. They were generic fitness ones and reaaaally in bad condition. It was the time to buy something better.  I'm currently considering getting smaller frames, these ones are 243 mm which is the longest you can really do slalom with. I know that there are better slalom skates out there like powerslide hardcore evo or seba igor, but I didn't have that much money at the time and also these kind of skates are not really good for traveling.  I'm thinking about changing cuff for one in different colors.  Let me know what do you guys think ;)"

rollerblading,36h5bn,that_tech_guy,1 point,Tue May 19 13:20:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting that they've switched to the street invaders being default setup.  I ran street invaders last summer, LOVED the grip but the wheels wore so quickly.  Every time I stopped on those things I flat-spotted and by the end of the summer you couldn't really tell the difference between the 76s and the 80s.  I'm curious about those hyper concrete ones tho, those sound interesting.  this season I'm trying out undercover powerblade wheels, 90a on my 80s and 88a on my 76s to see if I can compensate for the wear on my big wheels when I'm not slaloming.  So far I'm not 100% thrilled but I haven't put more than prolly 30 miles on the wheels yet, still breaking them in.  I use the same skates for slalom as I do for ""hauling ass down by the beach"" so I've been doing a lot of tinkering with my wheel setup hoping for that perfect solution.  honestly I think I'll just get two frames for my next pair of skates, one for slalom with the street invaders and one for speed/powerblade with something else."

rollerblading,36fa33,SLAiNTRAX,5,Mon May 18 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"When you're going downhill you should concentrate on managing your speed through carving from side to side like a skier would on a mountain. You can see what I'm talking about briefly in this video at about the 1 minute mark.  T-stops are most effective when on a level surface or very relaxed slopes, anything too steep and you'll just have too much momentum working against you.   I can try to help you further if you will clarify one thing, are your back issues exclusive to trying the maneuver when going down hills or also when you try to t-stop on flat areas? If it's the latter you may need to adjust your technique slightly, which I'm sure I can help you with."
rollerblading,36fa33,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Tue May 19 01:50:16 2015 UTC,"How would you go about controlling speed when going down hill in a very narrow path (i.e, pavement or something, with obstacles on the way) ? I usually use the T-""slow-down"", but maybe there's a better way.  I don't have access to video right now, so maybe that's exactly what's happening in the video you linked though."
rollerblading,36fa33,Kaamelott,1 point,Wed May 20 13:37:01 2015 UTC,"As ProFart says, using  carves and alternate foot drags is a good  technique - you can do this within the width of your own shoulders.   The key is don't build up the speed to start with.   If you're getting close to screwing that up and you have enough space, just make the journey longer (lots of small turns to convert forward - downhill - momentum into lateral momentum). You can also simply just turn 180 degrees so you take your downhill momentum and redirect it back up the hill. This is a great way to go down a hill without breaking at all."
rollerblading,36fa33,AlxxS,5,Fri May 22 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"Physically, you need to be able to ride comfortably on one foot, on an outside edge, going in a straight line, before you can do any form of T-stop / drag stop. If you can't do this, every time you attempt a t-stop you'll simply convert the slowdown into a turn (imagine a tank where one track moves slightly faster than the other - it'll turn in the direction of the slower moving track) or allow your dragging foot to move behind you, pivoting you about and putting you on your ass in an epically failed form of spin-stop.  This is why you are failing at the moment: you are using your hips and lower back muscles (or rotating your shoulders) to try and fight the rotational forces you are generating from incorrect technique.  Stop it. You're training your body to learn the wrong muscle memory, posture and position and to fight against rather than work with your skates.  So... lets break it down:  1) Learn on a flat surface. Go slowly, shift your weight to one skate with the wheels on a centre or outside edge. Do not progress until you can consistently move in a straight line with your other foot off the floor, while on the outside edge of the foot which is rolling. You should be able to wiggle and wave your ""off the floor"" skate a bit and still maintain an outside edge and momentum forward on your rolling skate.  2) Do 1 again and again, but with the other foot on the floor, and angle it out away from your direction of motion (by 20 to 60 degrees - wherever you get working for you).  If you turn or change direction when dragging this foot, its because you're falling onto an inside edge on your rolling skate -- this means means you've messed up step one and need to go back and do it again (and again.. and again... until you can actually do it properly).  3) You'll notice you're now effectively breaking / slowing down and keeping full control of you direction while doing so. Booyah. Next increase the angle of your dragging skate until you can get it at 90-degrees and control it well enough so that the rear wheel of the dragging skate never crosses behind the wheel of your rolling skate and never goes more than 90 degress back.  4) Well done. You can drag stop / T-Stop. Time go do the more advanced stuff. This means doing step 3  again and again and again and again while sifting more body-weight back from your rolling skate onto your dragging skate. This will increase the pressure on the floor thus increasing breaking force.  Time to rotate your wheels - doing this a will start to wear them down a lot, you'll need to replace them after a few tens of hours of practice.  5) You can now easily slow down, change direction (i.e. corner with a dragged skate) and rapidly stop on one side. Do all the above on your other side (i.e. the foot you were rolling on now becomes the dragging foot and vice-versa). Learn both sides to the same proficiency. You can thank me in a year or so when you want to play about with going backwards or get into slalom. Not to mention you'll even the wear on your wheels alternating how you break.  6) Learn to convert the drag to a edge or double-edge stop at the end so that you can stop ""on a dime"" and look epically cool and controlled at the same time."

rollerblading,36cx40,TheHundredth_Idiot,3,Mon May 18 11:28:55 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'll be glad to help you.    Anyone know what the skating is like over there?    I'm from Malmö so I'm not well versed in the Stockholm skate scene, but I'm sure you will find a lot of people on rollerblades.    Also anyone know what the rules are in terms of road/pavement/cycle lanes?    This is the good part. In Sweden you are allowed to use your inlines on all bike lanes (which is why I prefer skating in Malmö because we have bike lanes literally through the whole city) so don't worry about that.   You are also allowed to skate on normal roads, but remember one thing. If you are on a normal road skating faster than walking pace, keep on the right side, this way you are a part of regular traffic. However if you are skating in walking pace, keep to the left lane, this is so you won't be hit by cars coming in from behind. You will for example see runners do this a lot during the summers   I'd recommend you to skate fast if you're on the road though, because if you want to go slow you're better of on the bike lane or even on the sidewalk (you are considered a pedestrian as long as you're skating in walking pace so don't be afraid of using the sidewalks)"

Yeah it's really neat ! Although as you say, it's best to be aware of the traffic so nothing goes bad.   I pretty much never drive on  the roads as there are really good bike lanes here but it's nice that you can go on the road when you need to (Just don't forget to signal with your hand which way you're turning, this also applies to bike lanes) !"

So, if you are going to imagine this being an issue, make sure to contact whoever you buy them from first, and discuss sizing, and when you get them, try them on, and stand in them, but do not skate them and start trying to grind things, only to realize that they don't fit or rub.    Skate companies work on small margins, and using a product to a ""used"" condition and trying to return them puts the company in a hard place.  Good luck on your search, -APL."

rollerblading,36ccje,arnoldpalmerlemonade,1 point,Mon May 18 15:09:42 2015 UTC,"Mine are not ridiculously wide either, keep that in mind.  Skates just come shaped to different styles of feet."

I'm also having a bit of an issue finding Aragons or Icons online.  I think I'll try the Genesys 13 size since it runs wide. If that doesn't fit, I'll swap em out for 14s and see how that goes."
rollerblading,36bbo7,RSNLachy,8,Mon May 18 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"Generally, yes, people use the same foot. Although, it is very normal for people to do some topside tricks more naturally with the opposite foot of their soul tricks, so there is a bit of discovery involved.   Rollerblading is all about having fun and experimentation. Nothing much to stress about. You could roll alongside the square box and just get comfortable putting your topside foot on it. Then maybe lift up to a top acid. You could also start doing topsoul stalls on the coping and work from there. It's all good and would probably help most to just keep experimenting with everything. Stall stairs. Kick things. Just keep at it and stay in your comfort zone while still pushing yourself."
rollerblading,36bbo7,eHawleywood,3,Mon May 18 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"Regular.  Coping.  Topside is a normal grind, so normal foot, done essentially on the farside (opposite from where you jumped) of the object.  Really farside kind of exists but don't worry about that.  You just cock you foot/leg so you're really grinding on your frame instead of sole.  Because of this, coping should be easier because you can be turned more upright than on a ledge.  Honestly, practicing jumping clear over a normal round rail, then just clipping it as you go, then working that into a grind might be easier.  That's essentially what you're doing, you just catch yourself instead of letting your momentum take you over"
rollerblading,36bbo7,furrdogg,3,Mon May 18 01:21:56 2015 UTC,"First, never assume one foot is ""regular"" when learning. You should try both ways several times. Not only could you find out your other foot feels more natural, you could actually learn both ways from the get go.  Top acid was the easiest to learn for me, I treated it as a unity, and twisted my foot into top position. For others, they start with top porn (top sunny day) which, essentially is a back unity with your front foot twisted into top. When I was learning tricks I had to trick myself into being comfortable. When I started learning negatives, I just backslid with my front foot barely on the negative to do a neg-mistrial. Or fish brain, had to go to do a topsoul and grab my front foot. Rollerblading had an individual learning curve, meaning try everything into you find subverting that works for you. Just sing give up. Have fun! Edit; learn on a shin to knee high ledge. It's low enough where you won't get too beat up, but high enough where you HAVE to bend your knees. Plus, learning on a ledge helps you to understand how much you need to bend your knees/ankles where rails you can cheat your self"

Like above, I do HIIT, hill sprints (about 2km Hill, fun down, makes you wanna puke going up), a day where I only move by doing crossovers, backwards only days, and footwork days.  Footwork are the fun ones, get some speed and Dodge every crack, stick, leaf and rock in elaborate ways.

Work up to jumping when you can."
rollerblading,36adja,corgibuttzgaming,1 point,Mon May 18 12:10:51 2015 UTC,"""Suicides"" (not the slides) on skates are a hell of a workout.   1) Find a space about 50m (150ft) long. Mark out a 'stop zone' of 5m at either end  2) From a standing start accelerate the hardest you can until the stop zone, then break as hard as you can to stop before the end of the zone. Then accelerate the hardest you can back to your start point again, breaking as hard as you can at the break zone at that end. There is no ""resting"" time, the moment you stop, to 'turn and burn' again.  3) Do the above repeatedly - see how many you can do in 5/10/15 mins. For a harder workout increase the acceleration and sprinting distance, or do this on a hill/incline (even a small gradient makes a huge impact).   .    If the above is too intense, use a ""beep test"" track adjusted for a sensible staking distance  (i.e. 100m not 20)."

And have you looked in the Buyer's Guide tab at the top of the sub for European shops? You can count on calling those shops listed because there will be actual skaters answering your questions on different skate sizing or anything else and you can exchange your skates if you still get the wrong size."

Check out the Seba Street Invaders wheels for more grip and faster wear (the wear is totally worth the grip tho IMHO) or powerslide wheels which are a much more dense wheel, although some of them have variations in wheel radius which you can really feel.  I'm running a combination of full radius 80mm and my 76mms have a more tapered edge.  good for slalom but so far i wouldn't recommending that mix for speed - major speed wobbles."

I don't know too much about that Powerslide Imperial, but I don't value Powerslide as highly as Seba or Rollerblade."
rollerblading,36a8w0,RayLomas,2,Sun May 17 20:51:22 2015 UTC,Twister 80's all the way ;)
rollerblading,36a8w0,Sonox,1 point,Mon May 18 00:16:39 2015 UTC,"The expensive PowerSlide stuff (e.g. the Hardcore Evo's) are by far the best, but do take some bedding in. The older Imperials (i.e. their cheaper stuff) used to always be half-way between a Seba and a Twister and enjoyed none of the benefits of either approach and all of the downsides. I.e. they were shit. That said, the new Imperial Evo 80's look like they've gone more towards being a Twister clone, so they might be a lot better now. If you're looking at Imperials from last year or before, ignore them, if they're the new Evo ones they might be decent competition.  More generally, the Sebas are bulkier and have more padding and are thus marginally better for slalom, drops / jumps etc. The FR1 has many holes drilled in the frame mounting plates so you can adjust the angle of the frame, not just the alignment and the FR1 comes with slightly better bearings, wheels etc. Still, I don't know anyone who has ever has angled their frames and kept it for more than an hour and the difference in the bearings/wheels/whatever is negligible. Its a price-discrimination thing more than anything else (between the FR1 and FR2).   The Twisters are lighter and feel more responsive - especially at speed. They're also cooler as the liner is thinner and the openings in the plastic of the boot give you good airflow. In summer, even in the UK, this is a blessing.  So: you'll miss the extra padding of the Sebas if you're doing lots of jumps, shitty surfaces / terrain or fine toe/pivot control. You'll miss the airflow, refinement ""at speed"", and reduced bulk of the Twister's if you're doing lots of powerblading or 20km+ skates.  Either way, you can't go wrong with the FR1/2 or Twister - it comes down more to personal preference and after years on both my preference is towards the Twisters. For others it goes the other way. They're both great skates."

Here is the powerblading set up I'd personally go with in your position:  Boot:  Razors Cult Street Navy: This has remained my favorite boot for more than 12 years and you'll be hard pressed to find a better skate for the price.  Frame:  Ground Control Big: This is a powerblading frame from ground control, they can house maximum 72mm wheels so it's a perfect hybrid between grinding frames (wheels usually max out at 60mm) and Freeskate frames (which hold wheels between about 76-90mm) The link I just provided is for a complete frame kit which includes wheels, bearings and all necessary hardware. They come in a variety of colors, blue, red, white, black, and khaki.

rollerblading,35yy4x,Largesaurus,3,Thu May 14 18:04:42 2015 UTC,So...I'm not being flippant here.  Is this considered rollerblading or rollerskating?  I'm genuinely curious.
rollerblading,35yy4x,doobiousone,3,Thu May 14 20:24:04 2015 UTC,It's rollerskating. He's using rollerskates.

rollerblading,35yy4x,alksdjfd,3,Thu May 14 22:22:44 2015 UTC,Brian Wainwright is a legend he can skate whatever stance he wants and have my respect.
rollerblading,35yy4x,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu May 14 22:29:33 2015 UTC,"For real, it's got to be a ton harder to skate like that than the way we do."
rollerblading,35yy4x,hifire,1 point,Fri May 15 02:29:48 2015 UTC,"It's partly because Brian Wainwright's skating style is often more like skateboarding without a skateboard than it is like normal quad skating, but it's still quad skating. He's skating at almost fifty now and he is usually who first comes to mind when ""rollerskating"" and ""vert ramp"" is mentioned but he's not the only one to have ever taken to a halfpipe or bowl in rollerskates."

rollerblading,35uxbm,Geldenn,5,Wed May 13 18:45:29 2015 UTC,"You could:  -Clean and oil your bearings  -Make sure all your bolts are tight  If you want to sound like a ninja:  -Get stainless steel precision spacers (e.g. Buzzed ASSAPS 8mm X .405"")  -Get higher quality frames with bridges"
rollerblading,35uxbm,raffraff89,2,Wed May 13 19:01:37 2015 UTC,"I don't need a ninja mode just is that noise okay? I cleaned bearings already before, bolts arent tight though === I feel like the wheels wont even move if I make bolts tight; when i tighten them and make a movement over them with my hand, they roll just for a little while. You know what I mean right?"
rollerblading,35uxbm,raffraff89,5,Wed May 13 19:06:05 2015 UTC,"Some noise is normal depending on the age of your bearings, conditions, type of frames etc. It's not something to worry too much about.  If your wheels don't turn well when fully tightened, it usually means the bearing spacers are a tiny bit too small. This is extremely common, unfortunately, and I think a lot of people just accept it. The spacers that came with my SEBA skates are perfect but the spacers included with replacement bearings are always too small. When I built a new pair of skates from parts, I ended up buying these 'precision' spacers and they have been great."

rollerblading,35tder,soloroll,2,Wed May 13 14:26:52 2015 UTC,I just use a drug store wrist splint since I broke both mine some years back. Never had any issues and I use one almost every time I skate.
rollerblading,35tder,doobiousone,2,Wed May 13 12:22:55 2015 UTC,"wrist splint   Thanks, I hadn't thought of that. I very rarely actually fall on my wrist so I might try one of those."
rollerblading,35tder,NewYorkCityGent,2,Wed May 13 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"I used to do this but the ones they sell at CVS and Walgreens have a cloth/fabric liner that goes over the splint.  Over a month of two, the fabric rips up and the splint flies out rendering it useless.  I eventually went and bought a set of real wrist guards for less than the splint and they are more durable.  I purchased these triple eights.  http://www.aggressivemall.com/Triple-Eight-Wristsaver-2-Slide-On-Wrist-Guards-p/888-pad-wristsaver2.htm  If I had more money, I would have purchased the gloves.  I think it boils down to what kinds of tricks one is doing though.  If one isn't skating too often then I don't think it really matters."

rollerblading,35oijd,Justmindless,2,Tue May 12 12:36:20 2015 UTC,I just put on my skates for the first time in years after skating almost every day Back in the late 90's. I got some OS2s a few years ago and modified them a lot. I'm used to my old K2 Fatties so it was different. Long story short I'm trying to get my feet back under me and maybe hit the skatepark in Staten Island. Maybe then I can meet up for Tribeca.
rollerblading,35oijd,Justmindless,1 point,Tue May 12 16:52:07 2015 UTC,"skatepark in Staten Island.   Which one you hitting up? 5050 looks decent, although a bit rough around the edges.

rollerblading,35oijd,Gravityflexo,2,Tue May 12 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"This is inspiring, I too used to skate most days of the week for years and around 2002, as college was coming to a close, I found myself skating less and less.  I used to say, wow this has been the longest I haven't skated and it would be 3 or 4 months.  Next thing I knew I was saying, now this really has been the longest since I've skated, over a year.  Now, this last time it had been a couple years since I even put them on.  My Salomon Aaron Fienburgs had lost to time and the boots were actually disintegrated and the cuff split when I went to strap them in.  It really does make me feel old but at the and time I feel good knowing there is still people out there pushing it even further.  I remember when freaking royals came out, thinking that was pushing it."

Replace it with a ($20) xsjado shock absorber which lets you cup the heel of narrow shoes...   Apart from that, you might have to experiment with what positions for cuff, ankle pad, etc work best for you... It takes a lot of time to get it right! Also, you might have to do frame alignment if you are on really big wheels  Doops AND Xsjados also lose parts easily. Use threadlocker (loctite) on any screws you have.. careful with the ankle pad knobs because they are shite... I'd personally go for XSJADO Boot only and buy 90mm UFS aluminum frames (fusion RB?).  For shoes, i recommend something like Puma Driving Shoes"

rollerblading,35auq7,chowaniec,7,Fri May 8 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"The Royale or shifty. Changed the entire game. Not just a single trick that one single person did, but this trick literally changed everything we ever thought was possible in blading. Prior to that we had the soul, mizue, and frontside. The royale/shifty open the doors to the farve, backslide, torque soul, unity, savannah, torque, slap attack, the lurch, acid soul, shuffles, and countless other things. Its also the single most basic, fun, fantastic go to trick in the history of blading. Nothing, and i repeat, NOTHING is cooler that a basic, perfect squat, sitting low, no arms swinging, backside royale. Its my go to, always has been. I know someday i won't be able to do topsouls, and acids, and 540's, but i will always have the best trick in blading.  Also, Jon Julio's top acid in Mr. Mooseknuckle. That was the first topside grind i had ever seen. We had our minds blown. ""He did a farside on a ledge?!? How is that possible?!?"""

rollerblading,35auq7,PanzerKami,4,Fri May 8 16:42:24 2015 UTC,"Balanced fast slide by Dustin Latimer.  Before Latimer showed us that we could do it, balancing a fast slide seemed literally IMPOSSIBLE to, I think, EVERYONE. It isn't like people were trying it and Latimer did it first. No one even considered it a doable trick beyond just kicking small rails.  Also, something that people take for granted but same vid, same person: freestyle tricks. Now, I like grabbing my backslides and fishbrains, but I think realizing that we do not necessarily HAVE to grab every trick opened up a lot of possibilities.  Fuck, Latimer was amazing."

You pretty much get what you pay for in wheels.     But like warkid said, for general recreational skating get anything.

rollerblading,3597x1,KalasV,2,Fri May 8 04:00:59 2015 UTC,"Freestyle as in cones slalom? It's possible for basic tricks... rocker your wheels (smaller wheels on the 1st and 4th position/ front and rear).   If you mean freestyle as in freeriding or even anything related to jumping gaps... fitness skates have terrible frames and wheels for that kinda activity, usually... nope  I dont recommend ""freestyle"" in a fitness skate though."
rollerblading,3597x1,Warkid1993,1 point,Fri May 8 04:15:41 2015 UTC,To give you an example of the freestyle I mean here's a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvcHmRAgyrg
rollerblading,3597x1,PanzerKami,6,Fri May 8 04:21:13 2015 UTC,"Most of the things that this guy does is perfectly doable in your skates, assuming you remove the brake (if you haven't already). That said, fitness skates are not well suited for that sort of stuff and you might ruin them (certainly the wheels) if you do it for too long.     There are good, cheap freeskates like Seba FR and Rollerblade Twister. Would be much, much better.     Did you notice that the same guy have also made a tutorial video.. The exercises he recommends are a really good start.     I disagree that you should start by rockering the wheels. I don't know what level you are currently at but rockering is for slalom stuff where many tricks get much easier. But it's not a good idea if you are starting out. Until you get good at basic stuff like jumping and skating backwards you want 8 down. The guy in the video you posted skates flat for example, so rockering isn't necessary for that sort of stuff.     Did I mention you should remove the brake?"
rollerblading,3597x1,seveenti9,1 point,Fri May 8 07:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I saw it and decided to follow the exercises he recommends.

rollerblading,3597x1,corgibuttzgaming,3,Fri May 8 21:13:04 2015 UTC,remove the brake or die skating backwards. Your decision.

rollerblading,3597x1,PanzerKami,2,Mon May 11 18:40:46 2015 UTC,"but I read somewhere if you're still learning you should keep it. It also said I should wait to be able to skate on 1 leg for about 15-20 sec.      Yeah well. I disagree.    If you plan on only skating bike paths or other smooth, safe roads then you can keep the brake on if you want. All other applications, get rid of it. To keep it ""while learning"" is dumb IMO since you have to learn to stop properly at some point, better not get yourself any bad habits."
rollerblading,3597x1,ultimomono,1 point,Mon May 11 11:14:10 2015 UTC,"I decided to keep it at the moment but, I'm practising on my street ,who has somewhat of an hill, to brake. I don't think I do the ""T"" break tho, I'm doing a slow ""powerslide"". T-Braking is diffcult for me, my wheels just keep going but in another direction. So if you have any advice about that it would be appreciated.  Thanks for all the response!"
rollerblading,3597x1,Warkid1993,1 point,Tue May 12 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"Likely reasons for you having problems with the t-stop /t-brake / drag is that you put too much weight on the dragging foot and/or aren't low enough. The higher you stand the more the dragging foot will bite. Get low for more control. You should basically skate on one foot and add in weight on the dragging foot as needed. beyond that just keep practicing it can take a while to get smooth. And finally, keeping your heel-brake makes it more difficult. Just saying."

They focus too much really on the three of them rather than on just one at a time - where you'd be able to see what a great skate Barca is.  The couple of times I've skated Barcelona its been far more beautiful. The short skate along (mostly) the seafront from Passeig del Mare Nostrum to the end of Passeig Marítim looks much better in my memories, and when in the city centre the regular switching between small but beautiful patterned paving tiles and smooth, blissful concrete combined with incredible architecture makes it really quite special.  If anyone is heading there, I'd make a few suggestions:     Make sure to take some time out from skating to check out the Gaudi museum. It sounds a bit ""meh"" on paper but the guy's genius (for the time he lived in) is pretty amazing. The Sagrada Familar, for me, was just too crowded and not really anything special - although they had a lot about architecture in the museum part. If you are going, buy tickets online in advance - DO NOT QUEUE UP FOR THEM.  Spend at least one night getting utterly blitzed in one (or ten) of the great dive bars near La Ramblas and doing the tapas thing. Loads of interesting people from all over the world as there is a bunch of hostels in that area and drinks are amazingly cheap (less than 1 EUR  / 1.14$ for 0.5L in some) Pacha (Barcelona's version of the Ibiza and London nightclub institution) is amazing - if you're hard-core enough you can stay until kick-out (between 5 and 5:30AM) and get back to your hotel for a sobering-up / coming down breakfast, a nap and an afternoon skate to work off the drink.

The ones you found on The Doop Store are only $120 because they are an old model being replaced by new stock so the reason you can't get them shipped to the US is because their US distributor probably does not have any stock left.  This model of the Doop Basic is listed on Thuro Shop out of Mass. So I'm assuming they've got them.  Otherwise you can get The Freestyle 2 or the Freestyle 3 for current Doop models.  Xsjado's with a UFS recreational/fitness frame would work too, the only difference is the Xsjado skeleton does not have a raised heel like the doops and have hardware meant for grinding. But it's an option to consider if you're deadset on a strap-on style skate.   Then there's of course some traditional style skates if you're open to those."

I'll give it a month or so before I look into buying new skates.   I actually asked this sub a while ago and was told xsjados are difficult for beginners due to the positioning of the foot. Is this true? Even if it is, I wouldn't call myself an absolute beginner. I can already jump up and down curbs, skate backwards, and almost do some basic grinds."
rollerblading,350wr5,PanzerKami,2,Thu May 7 03:29:37 2015 UTC,"To have some pain in the feet for the first ten sessions or whatever isn't strange, I would say. Hang in there a while.    No, I don't think Xsjados are difficult for beginners, in fact I started on them. There might be some truth to that for aggro skating, i.e. grinding where they are a bit different. But for skating around in a powerblading setup they are fine for beginners. Also note there is a choice between 1.0 which is stiffer (no cuff) and 2.0 which has a cuff that provides more forward movement. The ""old"" one still exist because some prefer it, like me. I briefly owned 2.0's but got rid of them. Either is fine for beginners with a PB platform, and the 1.0's are very cheap. One of the best bang for buck you get at the moment, in my opinion."
rollerblading,3506pd,Brinazzle,2,Wed May 6 00:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'm used to skating in blades that are about three sizes too big. I'm looking to get a better fitting pair but want to try them on before I buy.      Well, to be honest you can achieve this by walking into the nearest general sports store, try on whatever recreational skates they sell (K2, Roces, SOC, RB, whatever) and pick a pair that seems comfy. They are bound to be better than what you are used to and will suffice for casual skating around.    Having said that... how skates feels the first time you put your feet in them is not necessarily how they will feel after being broken in. This is less true for soft-boots like K2 but still. Also, if you think you might want to do a bit more advanced skating (like freeskating or slalom) eventually then you can get better skates for the same money as a pair of rec skates... but that might mean ordering online unless you are lucky enough to have a good local skate store."
rollerblading,3506pd,PanzerKami,1 point,Thu May 7 12:06:53 2015 UTC,"I tried going into a local store and none fit very well.

rollerblading,3506pd,balsafresh,1 point,Fri May 8 18:01:42 2015 UTC,A piece of plastic was poking into one of my feet on the inside. :/ It hurt.

rollerblading,3506pd,basara-nekki,2,Sun May 10 02:15:59 2015 UTC,"If you you were trying on aggressive skates at Sports Authority, I'm guessing they were these. The shell on those is shaped pretty weirdly and they poke into my feet too. Definitely just need to find a place with a wider selection."

I'm cruising on some Roces Majestic 12's which were cheap but aggressive skates just aren't optimal cruisers.

rollerblading,34wt00,tromboner21,5,Tue May 5 05:21:18 2015 UTC,Seba High or Seba FR (several models) or Rollerblade Twister.  These are excellent urban/freeskating/allround skates that will allow you to do all kinds of stuff (except grinding). They are also tougher than recreational skates like K2.
rollerblading,34wt00,PanzerKami,3,Tue May 5 07:09:59 2015 UTC,Yea thanks! I don't think I'll be doing any of the slalom stuff I'll mostly just be going down streets and sidewalks    One more question that I have  If you're already a good skater how hard is it to learn how to grind?
rollerblading,34wt00,bladedvox,2,Tue May 5 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Learning grinds is different for everybody. People say to stall curbs and cracks in the concrete but my bro and I (proficient skaters who took up aggressive around this time last year) learned by the ""stair challenge"" and it took us a couple weeks to get our first grinds in. It is frustrating at first, as blading is in general haha, but just stalling up a flight of stairs is great beginner training."
rollerblading,34wt00,DranDran,3,Tue May 5 14:35:44 2015 UTC,"When it comes to freeskating and urban skating, you ahve two choices - Seba FR1 or RB Twister. They are generally in the same ballpark price wise, and deliver the same performance.  Among my skating crew, the general consensus is Seba FR1s take longer some time to break in, but once its done the fit is perfect and comfortable. Twisters, perhaps dont boast as tight a fit, but they are comfortable from day 1. Ive had mine for 3.5 years and never had a break in period. By now I wear them like a comfortable pair of sneakers, the fit tight enough to be crisply responsive.  Dont get seba highs (not worth the extra investment unless you are into slalom) or Bauer hockey skates (several inline hockeyplayers I know attest they are great on the rink but painful on the feet, but take this with a grain of salt). Forget about grinding on freeskates like twisters or FR1, but if you want to practise stalls and grinds but still want to mostly freeskate, maybe consider the RB Fusion skates."
rollerblading,34wt00,riderbug,2,Fri May 8 07:47:48 2015 UTC,"I have a pair of the Twister 80s myself and like them a lot. The boot fits very closely to the shape of your feet and is therefore very responsive. I like the control that gives me on the street, although it hasn't been without some deal of foot pain... (perhaps I'm wearing mine too small :x) They'd run you over $200   I definitely agree with HighRelevancy though about the importance of fit. I actually bought and used three different pairs of skates (over 2-3 yrs) online before finally finding a good fit (w/ that third pair) and even now, I still question if there's something more comfortable out there for me. If you're looking to buy online, I would suggest trying on different brands, sizes, models in-store to get an idea of what you like. If possible, maybe test those skates on carpeting first bc hitting the pavement would likely scruff the skates making return impossible if you find they don't fit well.   If I were you, I'd search stuff like urban skates, city skating, commuting, recreational/fitness skates, freeskates. I'm not very familiar with hockey skates at all so I can't really comment there. And I'd add Powerslide to the brands to look at  I don't think this site ships to Canada (sorry!) but you can check it out anyway.

I mostly bought them because they had good build quality without having to worry about size problems ordering online.   They may not be as good as the Twister 80s, K2s, or certainly not the Sebas that people here are talking about, but they're solid and I was able to bake them like normal hockey skates and now they fit perfectly."
rollerblading,34wt00,HighRelevancy,2,Tue May 5 20:49:27 2015 UTC,"If you wanna do dancey slalom-ish stuff, go with something like the Twister 80s, they're probably the most recommended skate for non-aggressive stuff. If you just wanna cruise the streets real fast, maybe look for something with a longer frame that takes 90mm wheels for that extra bit of smoothness (not sure what the standard recommendation is there).  If you can find a store you can get to that sells real brands (Seba and K2 and Rollerblade and such, not just cheap shitty ones), whatever they've got in stock is probably your best options because you can make sure the damn thing fits perfectly. Fit is the most important thing."

When I started hitting growth spurts and became huge, finding skates my size became prohibitively expensive for an unemployed teenager so I gave it up.  But I am no long an unemployed teenager.  I would likely be primarily using them for distance but would like the ability to start learning some tricks and grinding."
rollerblading,34vdfe,jjSuper1,2,Tue May 5 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"I was/am in the exact same place. If you want to think about distance, but have the ability to do grinds, this is the exact reason I purchased the Razor SL2 with the BIG frame kit. The larger wheels allow for more speed/distance oriented skating, but it also has an H-block in the frame purpose built for grinding.  I don't think I could ever tare them up, they are pretty solid.  And, parts are easily replaceable.  I believe you might want to look at some Powerblade setups: http://www.locoskates.com/see-all-powerblades/c251  These have a flat wheel setup (all wheels the same size), and a small to medium section in the middle of the frame for grinding when you're ready to tackle that.   Here is the brand new version of what I purchased: http://www.locoskates.com/razors-sl-quinny-big-frame-powerblade-set-up/p3402  and perhaps another option would allow you to wear your street shoes if you have issues finding a properly fitting shoe: http://www.locoskates.com/xsjado-2-0-powerblade-skates/p2321"

rollerblading,34v4uw,LetMeGetThisStr8,2,Mon May 4 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"Unless you want to buy two separate set-ups, I'd go for something more powerblade-orientated due to the need for more strength and support when you start jumping bigger things and grinding.   I don't know much about pure freeskates so can't really comment on whether or not a decent powerblade set up will let you do everything you want to with on that side of things. But I can't imagine that anything less than an aggressive boot will cope well with much high-impact abuse, and certainly not with grinds.  I'd check out some aggressive boot and powerblade frame/wheel combinations to see which appeal. You can see a few ready-to-go set-ups here. Take particular note of the frame designs - some are designed with H-block space between the second and third wheels to allow grinds, while some aren't. Personally, I wouldn't want to try any kind of grinds (apart from one-footed soul-based grinds) without H-block space.  Best advise is to call a reputable skate shop - even if you can't go in and try stuff on, any shop worth its salt should be able to give you advice over the phone. I'm in the UK so can't comment on US shops too well, but I recommend Loco Skates in the UK and I've heard good things about Shop-Task in the US and Canada."

rollerblading,34v4uw,PanzerKami,2,Mon May 11 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, given what you want to do you need a pair of freeskates. Rec skates won't be able to take long term jumping and general curb-based abuse. At the same time, if you aren't interested in grinding at all then I would not recommend powerblades. I have both and freeskates will give you more agility and control than a heavy aggro boot and pb frame.    Which essentially narrows your options to the freeskate market which is dominated by the Seba FR-line, Seba High and Rollerblade Twister."

My question is, if powerblades allow you to do the same as a freeskate (wth the option to grind) are their any setups you could recommend?

Imgur Here you can (hopefully) see the part that sticks out right in front of the ankle.

rollerblading,34tv6j,rudefetusman,1 point,Tue May 5 13:02:27 2015 UTC,"https://vimeo.com/126972380  After doing this video, I set to breaking my fingers and was able to get the buckle closed down 16 teeth on each boot.  I've also take to wearing them around the house non stop (XP grinding) and they seem much more stable with the tightness. I hope the video helps you see.  Maybe I'm just weak  PS Ignore Tumblr on my PC, I just noticed it... LOL"
rollerblading,34tv6j,rudefetusman,3,Tue May 5 21:51:10 2015 UTC,"alright thanks for posting the video...my suspicions were correct.  You are trying to push the buckle in.  What you need to do is open the latch on the buckle then thread it through.  Once it's fairly tight, you pull the latch closed which will give it another inch or 2 of tightness.  Once you get that squared away you shouldn't have any issues.  Watch this video...at about 2:15 he does it."

rollerblading,34tv6j,kav-,1 point,Wed May 6 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"Turns out I WAS doing it wrong.  I was not using the buckle on the outside - had no idea it even opened!  Problem solved.   Secondary issue,  having gotten use to the 72mm easy rolling wheels these 56's make me like a baby giraffe again! I got ABEC9 barrings just as in the other wheels, but they don't seem to roll as well.  Perhaps the Featherlights have a greater clamping force than the BIG frames.    Also edit:  Either these Amall bearings are crap, or I didn't put them in right.  Cause they just won't roll like the big wheels. The big wheels spin for days, but the little wheels spin for like not even a second and then stop.  Maybe I'll try the little wheels in the BIG frame."

At the end of the session today I was able to skate around the room continuously for 5 minutes without stopping or falling.  It was slow or super slow, but successful.  The boots feel better after a bit today.  I'm less convinced they're not tight enough."
rollerblading,34tv6j,sonicadept,2,Mon May 4 22:02:18 2015 UTC,They should be way tighter...your ankle should never bend in like that.  Getting regular frames should help too so good move on picking those up.
rollerblading,34tv6j,meparadis,3,Tue May 5 18:37:01 2015 UTC,Not having anyone remotely close to actually talk to about these things    I feel you :(
rollerblading,34tv6j,doobiousone,3,Mon May 4 19:23:53 2015 UTC,"Fellow SL2's owner here. Maybe the liners are too big? Try taking them out, put them on and try to walk a bit while wearing them, see how they feel. If they are too big, you might wanna get a new pair of liners that fit you better. If they feel OK, just give it time. Keep skating and you'll break them in soon.  I had the opposite problem when I got my skates a couple of months ago, I felt like my ankles couldn't move at all; I could only move forward but couldn't make turns. It got better after a month of daily skating. My skates are now very comfortable."
rollerblading,34uicw,sonicadept,1 point,Mon May 4 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, I suppose someone has to ask.    Why the fuck would you want to skin your genesys? There are already two entire skate brands dedicated to skinning ancient shells, isn't that enough?"

This is the magic that makes me love both yours and Todd's skating. Something so uninterrupted and tranquil. There wasn't any grinds in a normal sense, or any ""tricks"" but I'm still compelled to say this is one of my favorite edits in the last year easily. Thanks for always taking the time to correctly expose, compose, and shoot a shot. Every time I go out I lack the drive to actually film. This is just another jab at my inner voice that tells me that meh, it's just basic skating. It's not real tricks. You shouldn't film this. It's skating for self that you and Todd are doing and I'm very envious of the way you tell that story and share it.   The cinematography was stunning as always, and the skating was perfect for it. Please keep doing exactly what you dudes are doing and skating for yourselves but sharing it with us."

I've only started skating again recently an was just thinking about getting some protective gear after seeing this a new helmet is a must.  I'm interested to hear is anyone padding up (knees, elbows, wrists) as well? If so would gear would you recommend?"
rollerblading,34n94l,jitsujay,2,Mon May 4 00:13:17 2015 UTC,"I bought these and they seem very shock absorbent: http://rollerwarehouse.com/TSG-All-Terrain-Knee-Pad.asp They're pretty bulky though, so if you're looking for something that fits under jeans these wont work. The knees pads have already saved my knees a few times, and looking at rollerblade videos a lot of the pros could have used them too.   I also got the same brand of elbow pads but I haven't used them once. I don't really see a situation where my elbow will be in danger.   I haven't gotten wrist guards but I hear a lot of stories of people breaking their wrists. It might be a good investment to get a pair considering most of us are adults now and need to work for a living.  In my opinion the best combo if you're going to be doing new tricks is helmet, knee, and wrist. If you're more comfortable with what you're doing then just a helmet."

rollerblading,34n94l,Sonox,5,Sun May 3 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, smart move. We've already lost way too many people to TBI's and have come frighteningly close to losing even more people unnecessarily.  I never wore a helmet if I could help it and haven't worn one regularly since I was a kid or at a skatepark that forced me to but I've been doing a lot of thinking since the Dave Lang podcast. It's pretty stupid not to at this point and considering some of the falls I've had over the years it's just pure dumb luck that when it comes to head injuries I've only had some minor concussions and two gaping facial wounds. It's about time to reup my helmet stock."

rollerblading,34n94l,doobiousone,-1,Sun May 3 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not necessary to tell anyone they need to wear a helmet because if you're not already wearing one when doing dangerous shit then you probably don't have anything in your head worth protecting anyway.  (that unassuming green splatter you can see in the bowl is all that comes out when you crack open a brainless skater's skull so they're totally fine without helmets)"
rollerblading,34n94l,Largesaurus,2,Sun May 3 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"Downvoted because I agree that it's stupid to be doing dangerous things and not wear a helmet. ok.  This is on the front page right now so I will say again that I have no pity for people who shun safety when at risk.  Just to clarify, it's not dangerous if you're skilled enough and feel comfortable doing it without a helmet, but even Joey here who's probably one of the most skilled rollerbladers in this sub realises that testing the big wheel wizard frames is far more dangerous than the kind of skating he's done for years."
rollerblading,34nq3a,PROFESSIONAL_FART,5,Sat May 2 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"Hnnng, oddly satisfying to watch those stitching parts, whatever it's called. So much better than watching it being mass produced in a factory."

The gen cuff seem to have overall more flex but less forward flex.   The SL cuffs seem to stay rigid longer for me, and with them not covering the tongue area of my liner, have a little more forward flex.   It also depends on the skate you are getting. I think the SL cuffs are best left on the SL's but the gen cuffs are great on either. Either or, you can't go wrong with them."

I'm the kind of person who likes to be the best/one of the best at what I do and whenever I skate I get very depressed because I am no longer any good and being 22 I can no longer push myself as hard as I used to. What I basically mean is- I am 22 years old, afraid to go hard and injure myself, skating makes me depressed cause I am no longer good. So I'm fine with buying my last skate ever and just skating not as hard and not as often as I used to. Sorry, I'm bad at explaining."

What I mean is this- often when I start something, I'm pretty good and progress fast. So when I started rollerblading a long time ago, I picked things up quickly and was good at it. I compared my progress to other kids that were somewhat already known in my country and realised that if I kept on blading, I would totaly be able to catch up and actually be decent enough to be recognized in the tight scene of Latvian rollerblading (homeland of Nils Jansons). I don't know, I'm a very competitive person and it really makes me hate myself that I can longer go for being atleast decent in my country. I'm definitely overthinking it, but still.

rollerblading,34ldjs,raffraff89,1 point,Sat May 2 08:36:35 2015 UTC,"Xsjado footwraps run pretty much true to size for your sneakers because they're shoes after all. But calling the xsjado skeleton ""adjustable"", is a little disingenuous. They come in two sizes. For shoe sizes small (5-9) and large (10-13.)  With a size 15 foot you're gonna need a large and even then I have no idea if it will fit a shoe that large comfortably. But if it worked for you in the past with a low profile aftermarket sneaker then it should now too.  Valo is another brand to consider though, they make skates that get into very large sizes, but I think theirs max out at size 14 and run narrow."

rollerblading,34ldjs,chowaniec,1 point,Sat May 2 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"They're still adjustable, but they now have 4 different soul sizes so medium-sized feet people don't get stuck with something way too big/small."
rollerblading,34l95f,g_swag,2,Sat May 2 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"All the same actually. The frame has two rockered options, up and down. They give a significant increase to the size of the wheel possible. With it rockered up, the max wheel size without mods is 60mm. Down, I believe it's 66mm? Might be 72. With a small mod to the existing soul plate, they can hold 80's, but limit there do to the mounting point of the ufs frames.   I hope this helps."
rollerblading,34l95f,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Sat May 2 04:34:32 2015 UTC,Alright that's kinda what I thought thanks! I think it is 72 because aggressivemall sells a frame/wheel kit with 72's. Anybody have confirmation of this?

rollerblading,34l95f,meparadis,1 point,Sat May 2 05:15:09 2015 UTC,I saw the frame on Amall as well and was wondering the same question as you. Pretty sure you can fit 72mm outer wheels as long as you have antirockers on inner wheels. I think that its 66mm if you have a flat setup (4 normal wheels and no anti-rockers)
rollerblading,34kquh,mysteryandlost,4,Sat May 2 00:29:04 2015 UTC,get new wheels and this time be sure to rotate them so they wear evenly.

Something similar happened to me:  recently, I started blading again after a 16 year hiatus and experienced a similar problem with the antirocker setup. I ended putting together a flat setup to speed up the (re) learning process. Now that I feel more comfortable in my skates, I think I'm ready for antirocker."
rollerblading,34i7yw,glassnoodles,2,Fri May 1 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"This is one of the worst ""wall of text"" offenses I have seen on reddit.  That aside, I'm stoked you're getting back into it dude! Skating an empty skatepark in the mornings is totally the way to go. After the first month or so of regular skating, it becomes much less strenuous to skate. A whole bunch of muscles in your legs and feet which haven't been used in years are staging a grand return!"

rollerblading,34i7yw,Tunes_,1 point,Sat May 2 06:40:19 2015 UTC,"Also starting back up after 10 year hiatus. I love going in the mornings and having the park to myself! The only thing that scares me is if I fall the wrong way no one will be around to help me (especially in the bowl).   Grinding definitely looks easier in videos than it is IRL. The thing that is the hardest for me is learning to jump with both feet into a grind, it feels very unnatural. I decided to not let myself step into grinds after I got comfortable with the balance because I'm sure it's a hard habit to break. It has caused some scary falls, but now it's starting to feel natural. Gotta do it for the style points!  I used to roll flat back in the day, but i wasn't as focused on grinding back then. I miss the flat setup for the speed, but anti-rocker is just so much smoother on grinds. Maybe when I try the professional sized vert ramp i'll switch to flat again."

rollerblading,34h15n,AndrewKemendo,8,Fri May 1 05:49:29 2015 UTC,I personally think edits should be moving away from just jump-cuts of grind after grind because inline skates are capable of so much more than a skateboard and simply skating through lines actually can be entertaining to watch as opposed to a guy pushing a board on flat ground between spots. More mushroom blading dynamics/Ledoux parkour creativity would do lots for inline skating edits.

rollerblading,34g64s,xhevahir,1 point,Fri May 1 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"I was recommended to do it that way, so as to support my weight better, but I usually put it forward so I can more easily control my speed by angling that skate."

rollerblading,34g64s,hifire,5,Thu Apr 30 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"Haha, you want to get used to treating your knees and legs as shock absorbers for the rest of your body. Keeping them slightly bent not only lowers your center of gravity but also gives you a bit of flex for fighting through rough terrain like that ""tactile paving"" (TIL) on the sidewalk.  The other big thing is keeping your weight off your toes and more on your sole and heel. For rough terrain you can even 'pick up' your toes a bit as you get into it to make sure you don't catch that front wheel.  Happy skating!"

rollerblading,34c02o,Largesaurus,2,Wed Apr 29 22:58:26 2015 UTC,this seems like a weird thing to ask but are they skating a flat setup with just harder wheels in the middle (so they can slide)? I guess if not then maybe that ledge is just super slippery

rollerblading,34di9w,PanzerKami,3,Thu Apr 30 07:18:50 2015 UTC,"China's been making and selling slide-focused wheels to a domestic market for a while now, so these are hardly the first.  The Chinese wheels are mostly just cheapish super hard (90+) single density wheels though, so this might be new if they shave off and roughen up the smooth and grippy outer shell that new wheels come with. Most people just do few powerslides or something to break in new wheels, something that you might not need to do with these.  That's just a conjecture though. I don't know how well these actually work, but 85A seems a little too soft for pure sliding. Cost is the other problem I see with these wheels. Slides chew through wheels incredibly quickly, so you want them to be as cheap as possible to buy more sets. Making them dual density of course increases the cost, and for practicing slides more (usable) wheels > better performing wheels."
rollerblading,34di9w,svakdo,2,Thu Apr 30 07:48:13 2015 UTC,"Diving deeper into the PR material, I found that they are apparently ""pre stone grinded"" which is supposed to make them slide better ""out of the box"" without breaking in. Ok, that might be true in theory but in practice it would only save minutes. I also find all these assertions that they are ""DESIGNED to slide"" blah, blah but absolutely zero explanations on what that actually means. The smell of marketing bullshit is getting overwhelming."
rollerblading,34di9w,Stickeesox,2,Thu Apr 30 07:34:39 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I figured they'd just be really hard. They're 85a though"
rollerblading,34di9w,Renegade_Dist,2,Thu Apr 30 19:37:20 2015 UTC,"Hard doesn't necessarily mean that they're better or worse for sliding - for sure 88a is gonna slide more than 82a, and last longer, but my favourite for slides is 85/86 because it also has some grip, so you can control the slide better and not just slip out - if hardness was the only thing that counted, wheels might as well be made out of plastic! The dual density are basically worn down wheels out of the box, they probably work good, but the dual density system/core actually makes these wheels pretty slow in our experience so far...."

rollerblading,34b6w8,sonicadept,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"Keeping your weight towards the back (heels going forward, toes going backward) let's you go over bigger bumps. Try staggering your feet so they're not next to each other. It'll help your overall balance and let you roll over even bigger bumps.  Speed comes with experience.   To stop, try bending down and stepping in front with your skate pointed in, using your leg muscles to stop you. Once you get that down at very low speeds, work your way up until you feel confident stopping at faster speeds. Also, try making half circles with your skates. It takes leg muscles but is pretty easy to do.  Sorry if these descriptions are terrible. Try youtube if you need more help"
rollerblading,349yyi,meparadis,2,Wed Apr 29 14:00:33 2015 UTC,I love them. Haven't found a skate that I like better than M12s.
rollerblading,349yyi,dickheadjustin,2,Wed Apr 29 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"They take some getting used to, but they are pretty fun once you do. You really do have to adjust your style of royale--angled toward the back--if you want to take advantage but they are as good as any once you do, and an amazing farv skate imo.   I don't agree with topsides being more difficult. I think that's just a mental thing. I can do all of my topsides, true topsides, anything on ledges, just the same on those, or maybe better because of the flex.  An optional soul, something like the valo two piece made to fit, sounds great in theory, but the skate would begin to loose its class, so I don't personally like this idea. It would feel like the poor salomons or other skates that begin to degrade (in their appeal) through some identity crises of increasing soul plate size, adding skins, removing skins, and then we all still prefer the original and wish the skate hadn't gone through such a prostitution of its identity.  tl;dr: v13 is classy, let's keep it that way.  edit: they are fun skates to mod if you want to try other soul plates."

rollerblading,349yyi,alksdjfd,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:54:52 2015 UTC,I actually sold mine cause I hated these plates and the fact that sizes 9 and under has a significant smaller soul plate than bigger sizes which is annoying for top tricks... V13 with better a backside plate groove and slightly bigger soul plates (for size 9 and under) would be the best skates I've ever ridden... I'd seriously ride these 24/7 if these changes were made!

rollerblading,349opp,djjz13,2,Wed Apr 29 12:22:50 2015 UTC,Twister 80's all the way... Can only tell good things about them!
rollerblading,349opp,Sonox,2,Wed Apr 29 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"Hello there! You've got some great skates picked out. I think you'll be happy with either of the three options you've got here.  You're looking at nearly inconsequential weight differences between all three (especially the two Rollerblade models) so that shouldn't factor in much here.  The Maxxum and the Twister are actually the exact same boot the main difference is in the frames:  Maxxum - longer frame length (260mm standard or 280mm if you wear a size 10 (US) or larger) for excellent stability while fitness/recreational rollerblading. Great for cruising around bike trails, public parks, and roads.   Twister - shorter frame length (243mm) for enhanced maneuverability. This is great for skating through crowded urban environments where agility and abrupt evasive maneuvering is a must but sacrifices a bit of stability.   Bearings: The Maxxum have SG9 (eqivilant of an ABEC9 rated bearing) while the twister come with SG7 (think ABEC7) both of which should suit your needs well while you get back into the swing of inline skating. Wheels: The Maxxum comes with Rollerbalde Hydrogen wheels out of the box. This earns lots of points in my book, because it's a great wheel that I'd recommend upgrading to otherwise. While the Twister comes with RB Supremes, which is a good wheel, but like I said, I tend to favor the Hydrogens so if you get the Twisters you might consider swapping out the wheels for a pair of Hydro 80s when the first pair wears out. Liners: The Maxxum has a v-cut liner for greater range of motion and flex, while the Twister comes with the RB 5-star liner which is a little beefier and meant to take a little more punishment while remaining supportive (after all, the twister is an Urban skate designed to handle some tricks, and fast city skating)   Seba GT90: Seba makes good skates, period. Most everyone I know that buys Seba would continue to buy from them. With the GT90 you've got a really interesting fitness design with a 276mm frame (nice and long, great for stability) ILQ9 bearings and some decent stock 90mm seba wheels.  What sets this skate apart the most from either Rollerblade inc. models you mentioned is it's 4 point adjustable cuff. This allows you to adjust the cuff position forward, backward, high and low for a customized fit to suit your personal preferences. (this might be a little more customization than someone just getting back into skating needs however)  So if it were me choosing between these three options, I'd probably buy the Maxxum unless I were sure I'd be doing a lot of city skating (with a few tricks thrown in) and weaving through crowds in which case I'd get the Twisters.  Hope this helps!"

rollerblading,345wbv,i_mush,6,Tue Apr 28 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Any frame for aggressive should be UFS. The bolts will be in the correct locations and all mount correctly.   A small and a large frame will have the same hole placement as well, so in theory, you could have a small frame on a size 15 skate or vice versa.   Short answer, yes. They all fit. Slightly longer answer, reread the above."
rollerblading,345wbv,Travis_Stewart,3,Tue Apr 28 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"Any UFS frame will fit any boot of any size. But, you should make sure you get the right size frame for your foot and style of skating. The faster you plan to go, the longer the frame you want."

rollerblading,342v0z,joey_mc,19,Mon Apr 27 21:40:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't really care for this article. I feel like it's only getting upvoted because Vice printed another ""story"" about rollerblading.  Robbie Pitts wrote his in March so is this going to be a once a month thing for 2015?  If it is I really do hope to see a little more depth. Let's explore beyond the superficial questions that keeps getting asked; ""do people still rollerblade?"" ""whatever happened to rollerblading?"" because the answer is always ""yes, rollerbladers still exist"" then there's an obligatory recitation of the gay jokes, and the next thing you know the article is over without ever having a chance to explore anything substantive about rollerblading/rollerbladers.  I try to keep positive in this community, but I just have to question the intention and purpose of articles like this and the one Vice printed last month.  At a certain point we need to value ourselves more than to keep getting stoked over any and all articles that get printed about rollerblading on mainstream websites regardless of quality.   I'm proud of Leon for representing in the article.. But the author is talking to Leon Basin and the best she can do is ask him whether rollerbladers worry about being cool? It just seems like a wasted opportunity that will get far more fanfare among rollerblading circles than the quality actually warrants."

Personally it missed the mark, I read it and I feel nothing; but maybe theres people out there being stimulated to think about skating again; maybe inducing some readers to remember the days before the homophobia and awkwardness of rollerblading that has since faded away. I know people that I think would read this and then consider dusting off their blades or starting outright, and thats something... it may not be good-or-inspiring-article something, but it's something."

rollerblading,342v0z,doobiousone,2,Tue Apr 28 07:03:37 2015 UTC,One thing I was thinking about last night when comparing rollerblading and skateboarding and other similar sports. Skateboarding for the most part aside from longboarding and such does not have much of a recreational aspect. If you are skateboarding you are learning to ollie or kick flip etc. Rollerblading on the other hand is not so limited to just being an aggressive sport. While this is kinda cool it also means people are always going to see spandex wearing people with huge neon helmets skating around. There is no chance my mom is going to put on pads and a helmet and skateboard. There is a much higher chance that my mom will put on pads and a helmet and rollerblade around. It's nice that rollerblading is very inclusive but it also creates somewhat of an image problem.
rollerblading,342v0z,Morbidgrass,3,Wed Apr 29 16:07:17 2015 UTC,I skate home from work every day. Only been called a fruitbooter once so far. I guess that's something.

rollerblading,342v0z,gypsyblader,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:27:13 2015 UTC,"I think there are two reason why rollerblading was a ""fad."" The first is that everyone was buying cheap, shitty skates and didn't really get a proper experience and the second reason is that the boom was mostly sold to kids/teens and they grew out of them. If it had been seen as more of an adult athletic hobby we wouldn't have as much of a problem, that and douchey skateboarders who can't get over themselves."
rollerblading,342v0z,thecoyote23,2,Tue Apr 28 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"I also kinda feel that blading in the US has had a huge focus on aggressive inlining and tricks, which is not particularly something everyone wants to risk because of the huge potential for injury.   Here in Europe most bladers practise recreational/fitness inline, freeskating at best. When I hit the street Ill run into at least 30-40 other fitness bladers on my usual route. I see agressive inliners maybe once or twice a week, they are a very select subset of the mainstream group of bladers here (though I assume they wouldn't frequent my routes and prefer skate parks).   Those of us who practise slalom are also a small subset of most bladers, but still, inline skating is very mainstream here in Spain, and the fact that its been ingrained into local culture that inline skating doesnt have to involve grinding rails and hitting halfpipes, but can be a leisurely areobic exercise, has helped popularize it massively over the past 5 or 6 years to the point of where we can begin to call it a revival of this so-called ""fad""."

rollerblading,33xq81,secondjelly,4,Sun Apr 26 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"Anything with 80 or 84mm wheels from a trusted manufacturer will do fine for campus/city navigation: RB, SEBA, Powerslide/USD, K2. Bigger wheels than this will be faster but harder to stop, turn, and balance. If you can try them on in the store, do so and remember they will fit a bit too tight at first before they break in.  W/R/T urban w/ plates or bigwheel aggressive, types of setups do exist, and they are quite fun.  Out-of-the box, I think Rollerblade Fusion X3 link here or whatever can still be found around the net. The soul nubs on it are tiny but you can swap them out for the positive-side-plate of the RB Solos. If you can still find them, they would probably be the cheapest way to roll the style of skate you're looking for.  On the more expensive side, USD releases some of their skates with bigwheel frames out of the box. Also, SEBA makes a soul-kit for the FR skates.  If you wanna try something else, you can put these bigwheel frames on any UFS aggressive skate: Solomon FSK frames, Rollerblade Fusion frames, Kizer Advance/Arrows/Level2/Level3 frames, GroundControl BIG frames, Bake frames. I went this route earlier this year and invested in Arrows for my Remz HR1.3: pic here  tl;dr: Anything from Rollerblade (not bladerunner, that is their cheapshit sub-brand), SEBA, K2, with 80-90mm wheels should have you zipping along.

You can do it, people do, but the quality of ride would not be similar, especially depending on the terrain (smoother cement would be less noticeable, but you will especially notice the difference going over cracks, bumps, grass, etc). The wheel wearing out question is not so simple because it is not simply the size but also hardness/softness/quality. Aggressive skates now have bigger wheels options, though, and that is what people mean when they mention BIG frames (or Bake or Level II/III).  I personally have one set-up for when I want to cruise around and another for doing purely aggressive skating. Something like Bake frames, BIG frames, or Kizer Level II/III are good possibilities for mixing worlds, but I don't agree that they are the best of both worlds. I'd say while some people get used to them and love them, they are a compromise when it comes to doing tricks relative to an anti-rocker or smaller wheel aggressive set-up, and a compromise for speed/maneuverability compared to metal, larger wheel set-ups. That said, the BIG/BAKE frames are an AWESOME compromise as you can do tricks in them and they are super fun to cruise around in.  Something not mentioned would be getting Kizer slimlines, which would allow you to have two very large (up to 80 mm) wheels on the outside with two small wheels in the middle. This will be less maneuverable than a flat setup with smaller wheels, but might be more negotiable for cracks and terrain. I personally would prefer this for what you are asking versus a normal flat set-up, but that's me.  Some people skate tri-rocker, which is three big wheels and one anti, but this isn't very economical because they don't sell six pack wheels.  I just wanted to point out there are lots of possibilities, and that's part of the fun, in finding what you individually prefer, your own style of blading, making it your own.  tl;dr I would personally go with BIG/Bake/Level III frames if you want one skate that can do both. Best of both worlds would be one strong rec/freestyle set-up and one strong aggressive set-up."
rollerblading,33v5dv,freshyyyy,3,Sun Apr 26 15:38:05 2015 UTC,Could always look at getting some Ground Control Big frames for the best of both worlds.
rollerblading,33v5dv,doobiousone,2,Sun Apr 26 01:52:50 2015 UTC,I was going to say something along these lines.  Kaltik also makes frames meant for a flat 8 wheel set up while having a large H-block for grinding.  Kizer also has a flat frame too.  I've skated the Kizers and liked them xcept sometimes I'd get wheel bite doing certain groove tricks.  I'd definitely look into one of these kinds of set ups for commuting while retaining the ability to skate obstacles.
rollerblading,33v5dv,polskimoose,3,Sun Apr 26 02:36:52 2015 UTC,"the kaltiks flat rockered is a good idea. i didn't recommend the bigs cause if they already have rec skates they might as well go full aggressive wheels, in my humble opinion."
rollerblading,33v5dv,polskimoose,3,Sun Apr 26 04:56:23 2015 UTC,"I used to commute in my aggressive skates all the time.  The wheels will wear out faster than the rec skates and it will be about twice as much work to get around, but if you're not going too far it won't be too bad."
rollerblading,33v5dv,Reelbk,3,Sat Apr 25 23:19:21 2015 UTC,"Aggro skates will never be as fast as rec skates, mainly because the wheel diameter is much smaller. You'll have a rougher ride and heavier skate.  I'd get the aggro skates, but hold on to your recs. That way you can pick what suits your mood any given day."
rollerblading,33v5dv,ei8htpo1nt,2,Sun Apr 26 05:41:47 2015 UTC,Yeah good answers by all...I'm riding Kizer Level 3 power lading frames with 76mm first and fourth wheels and 56mm second and thirds. Allows me to glide much more smoothly over rougher terrain while leaving my hblock relatively free to grind. The caveat here is that you lose some of the stability when you land after airs and grinds because the larger outer wheels have a narrower profile than do aggro wheels. Experiment with combinations until you find what feels right. Enjoy!

Skiboards, being shorter, also allow for performing some skate-style tricks much easier than skis would.  Unities, kindgrinds, sweat stance, etc.  So, there IS a benefit of skiboards vs. skis, for a rollerblader."
rollerblading,33sg12,chowaniec,3,Sat Apr 25 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"ok, maybe a kg on a box might look cool, but it seems wildly risky on a rail and probably even more impossible to make look cool--but don't get me wrong, I grew up ski boarding and skiing; it's just like the emerging idea that rollerblading can look damn cool just by the process of moving around or ripping around a bowl, contrasted by the skating of the early 2000s which focused on perhaps less spectacular rolling but very difficult grinds... to me, we as street skaters lacked a focus on overall flow back then"
rollerblading,33sg12,doobiousone,0,Sat Apr 25 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"Well the thing about skiboarding is not that it is just a way to bring skate-style to the snow.  A lot of skiboarders go out there to prove that we can do everything both skiers and rollerbladers can do, and we can bring it to the snow with style.  That of course is not to say all of us do that.  You should really check out some episodes of RVL8 Skiboards' Junk Show.  The man behind it, Dave Bloom, was a (lower level) sponsored skater by K2 back in the late 90s.  He definitely brought a lot of skate-style, and in a clean-looking way, to snow.  Additionally, you have other guys from RVL8 who are doing difficult tricks with style and looking great.  Two great, contrasting examples: Kirk Thompson, who also brings a nice skate-style to the rails, and Dave Lynam, who brings a major ski-based style to skiboards."

rollerblading,33ox5p,NakedChickOnTheWall,3,Fri Apr 24 08:31:06 2015 UTC,"Pads. Complete pads. And helmet unless you have a flat space also without cars. No matter how hot, keep them all on until you feel super solid. Even then I always wear knee and wrist pads no matter what. You are going to fall alot. The key to learning is not to have those falls turn into injuries. Had a neighbor fellow skater get two broken wrists this month by skating without wrist pads.  For a first skate make sure it has a high boot. That's how you stand up and how you skate without breaking an ankle. If you get into speed skating later you can get a low boot.  Personally, I'd get the basics down before starting aggressive. Learn to drop to your knee pads while rolling as a first thing. Then get a good stroke. Learn to stop. Get comfortable with cross over steps. At this point you can skate for fitness or speed skate. Learn to turn backwards. Learn to stoke backwards.   After that it depends on your goals. Skating for transportation? Focus on curbs and obstacles. Skating for hockey? All sorts of great drills.   Good luck. I find it a great hobby. I used to skate pretty hard but now I use it as a low impact interval cardio alternative."
rollerblading,33ox5p,cmsonger,2,Fri Apr 24 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"Find an empty, flat, smooth, level parking lot.  Put your skates on while sitting in your car with your feet sticking out.  That way you don't have to deal with standing up right away.  Hold on to your car and skate around it, getting used to how the skates feel on your feet.  You could also try using a shopping cart to skate away from your car.  You should get it soon enough.  If your name is any indication, don't skate naked! I know all the cool kids are doing it but you might fall and get pebbles stuck in places.  Do, however, skate along walls."
rollerblading,33ox5p,crabwalktechnic,3,Sat Apr 25 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"It would probably be a good idea to see if there are any instructors at your local skatepark. If you can get a good instructor, that would help you avoid picking up bad habits that are difficult to rectify later on.  Unfortunately there's no way you can really learn to skate by reading things online, but you can find videos here that will help you get an idea of what to do.   Standing up is a matter of building your ankle strength, ideally you have your weight centred on your feet so the wheels are parallel  to each other and perpendicular to the ground like this | | , if you put your weight on the inside or on the outside of the skates then you're probably going to cause yourself some ankle pain."
rollerblading,33ox5p,Vulgar_Slaughter,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:05:18 2015 UTC,"I can look into it, but I doubt there will be because sports like these are very rare around here. I live in basically the middle of nowhere so resources and people who know what they're doing are pretty uncommon.  Balancing sounds hard, but I think with enough practice I can probably pick it up. I did think of one thing though, one of my feet is messed up so I physically cannot stand on the toe of that foot. That won't effect anything or give me trouble skating, will it?  I'll watch the videos you linked when I've got time to sit down and pay attention again, thanks for the help."
rollerblading,33ox5p,Unforgettawha,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:15:37 2015 UTC,"The toes getting in the way shouldn't be a problem if you have the correct posture, to move with inline skates you mainly push your feet to the outside by using the ball of your foot and you also balance yourself with your heel and blade of your foot. I hope that makes sense. Keeping your center of balance is also key, it is usually the ""core"" area of your abdomen right below your diaphragm. And as /r/Vulgar_Slaughter said, don't place your weight to the inside or outside of the blades."
rollerblading,33ox5p,Vulgar_Slaughter,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"To be honest the thing with your foot shouldn't affect you that much hopefully, you might just have to work around it a bit.   For example my left ankle is far weaker than the other because of muscle damage caused by a compound fracture on my shin when I was younger. I cant do many tricks with my weight on my left leg and I also can't roll on that leg alone for any decent amount of time. It's just a case of working around it and having fun making the best of the ability you do have."
rollerblading,33ox5p,jokingrotten,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:32:04 2015 UTC,"before you leap to buying skates, make sure that you have lots of wide sidewalk or paved trails or quiet streets, which are free of gravel, sand, potholes, etc. The surface which you skate on will radically affect how pleasant the skating is.  Even if you live in a remote area, might there be a shoe store or general sports equipment store? These stores should have a way to accurately measure your foot (such as this), which they would probably be happy to lend to you momentarily for you to ensure proper skate sizing. You could even call ahead to make sure that it's cool.  What kind of rollerblading do you plan on doing? I think skates can be approximated to live in three categories: aggressive (trick) skating, distance skating, casual skating. That's a gross oversimplification, but anyways.... Depending on what you plan to do in your skates will drastically affect the skate that you should purchase.  What sports have you played? If you have never played a sport which involves sliding or balancing on something (eg. skating, ski/snowboard, tightrope, sandboarding, longboarding, even walking along a thin line) then rollerblading is going to be difficult, at first. Your body may not have had to really use muscles in such a manner before, and rollerblading will feel uncomfortable. But if you skate with any regularity, you will feel much better after a month or less.  Skating is a pleasing activity to do, once you attain even a moderate level of competence. I cannot think of another activity whose most basic actions are so enjoyable. You can skate quite amazing distances over flat terrain with quite little energy, and lets you enjoy the scenery at a unique pace.   ...Assuming you live somewhere where skating is possible, as outlined firstly."
rollerblading,33ox5p,PanzerKami,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"I learned to skate on my own and by myself, with no help other than what I read and watched online, so it's entirely possible.     Get skates. Whatever you want to do later, I would recommend a freeskate or rec skate. Something like the Seba FR line or Rollerblade Twister will get you a good allround skate that will last you a long time for not much money.   Wear pads and a helmet. You will fall (if you don't you're not doing it right). Protection will give you the confidence needed to learn.   Watch lots of youtube videos on basic technique.   I started at an empty parking lot. Went really well, even with zero previous experience I could do crossovers (albeit poorly) on my first skate. Make sure you find somewhere safe, with no traffic or people, parking lot, skatepark, school yard, whatever.      Stay on the parkinglot (or skatepark or whatever safe place you find) until you start to feel confident on the skates. Only then move on to bike paths (or similar). Stay away from traffic for now.   Over-train stopping. You have to get your braking and stopping technique down. Everything else is secondary. Only when you feel confident in stopping should you venture into traffic (actually it's optional, some never do).    Be patient. Do not care if you look like an idiot (let em laugh you have wheels on your feet). Make sure you practice the basics a lot. Braking, stopping, jumping and crossovers. (Yes, jumping is a basic technique in my opinion, often the easiest way to avoid a small obstacle, water puddle or gravel spot is to jump it).      When it comes to buying skates... sizing is critical so obviously the best thing is to try them out in a store but unless you are fortunate enough to have a good skate store nearby you will have to buy online. Which might mean sending skates back. Research sizing for whatever model you decide on before ordering (some run small or big, you can get that info online, or ask here). Sports stores selling recreational skates usually do not know shit.    Good luck."

You say there's no roller rink, is there an ice rink? The basic process of standing up, pushing off and stopping are the same as ice skating really, and it might be a good way to get some basic lessons in before you go out on your own.  Finally, make sure you know how to loose speed as well as build it up, when I was younger I spent a lot of ime careering into bushes to slow down, and that gets old fast"

In the end you get pretty similar results but:  Wheel wear is more difficult to maintain in the Rocker Wheel setup as the rocker depends on the wheel size and not in the frame itself. So when the middle wheels are starting to wear out, you cannot simply put your outer wheels in the middle."

rollerblading,33j8j9,Vandebe,3,Thu Apr 23 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"If your rolling on 72s then you're definitely going to want to create some space, but I'm wondering what kind of setup you're riding...did you buy aggressive skates? Or are you riding a rec/fitness skate? If you're on a rec skate, you can remove the 2 center wheels but you're gonna snap your frames in a week or less trying hblock grinds because...rec skates don't have hblocks.  You also will have a rough time with soul based grinds because rec skates have very little sole to grind on.   I don't advise grinding on rec skates, but you can still spend some time in the parks learning ramps, banks, and gaps (don't get crazy with the gaps unless you have an above average quality rec skate bc again, rec skates aren't made to take the beating aggro skates are)...that said, if you have an aggressive skate, and you want to keep your 72s, yeah, take out the two middle wheels.  You'll stick your hblock grinds with them in.  But don't leave that space empty...put two smaller wheels in their place. I'm rocking Kizer Level III frames with 76mm outer wheels and 56mm inner wheels, and I love it. The inner wheels are small enough to be out of the way but big enough to give me some extra stability to lock in. Plus the smaller wheels are a harder composite than the outer, so my outer wheels are grippy while the inner ones are tougher and have more slide. You can also use grind wheels, which are much smaller, are made of a hard plastic, and have no bearings. They are great if you ride on an aggressive frame, and I use them on my Ground Control FL3 frames with 2 56mm wheels on the outsides...I would use them on my Kizers but my Kizers are made to be deep enough to hold my 76s and the grind wheels are too small to matter on that frame...but I digress. I hope this helped...have fun and stay dangerous."
rollerblading,33j8j9,ei8htpo1nt,2,Thu Apr 23 00:51:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed response! I am using aggressive skates with an hblock. I will also try using smaller inner wheels. Thanks!

rollerblading,33hb3z,RumBowlSkillSpin,3,Wed Apr 22 14:57:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pretty sure you could do it but I don't think it would look nearly as good as the salomon ST/carbon mod because the boot tapers so much toward the heel.   You'll probably end up with carbon souls that stick out almost much as xsjado souls do at the heel on an ST boot.  If I were you I would just use them as a dedicated big wheel skate. The FSK is such a great boot and they're hard enough to come by now that I personally feel modding it would be a shame. But if you do decide to try the mod, please try to take pictures of the process and the end result, I'd like to see that."
rollerblading,33hb3z,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:59:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Just making sure it wasn't impossible for some reason. The FSKs are way more common here in The Czech Republic than any other salo boots.  I figured they would be a bit bigger, less attractive than the Sts.  I got a big wheel set up I am going to try to make work. Ill post some pics and probably more questions.  Thanks."
rollerblading,33hb3z,chowaniec,2,Wed Apr 22 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"It's definitely possible. You'll need to flatten out the bottom of the boots by grinding off those raised ribs running lengthwise on the boot. Then you need to grind a lot of the carbon souls flat, which you'd have to do with any Salomon. Is it worth it? I think the FSK is roughly the same as the ST boots, but I'm not sure."

rollerblading,33e6lt,slavko1004,3,Tue Apr 21 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"the moment I took off my blades, pain disappeared.      This and the position of the pain make it sound like it's pressure points rather than soreness from riding. If so there are a number of things you can try.      Try to figure out exactly what part of the skate/boot that is hurting your foot. Then see if there is something you can do to reduce the pressure.     Sometimes it can be enough to change how the skates are laced/buckled (for example I had pressure points on my Sebas and the pain disappeared completely when I simply stopped lacing through the fourth hole, they are since the most comfy skates I have).     In some cases you can change the boot by heating the plastic and pushing it out at the pressure point. If the liner is the problem you may be able to modify it or even change to a different liner. Another thing you might try is to use an insole in the skate. Just raising or lowering the foot in the skate can be enough to fix it. Thicker/thinner socks is also worth a try. Maybe someone else has more ideas."

rollerblading,339sl6,ikessa,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:01:24 2015 UTC,I was looking in the the male VO2 90s but decided against them as they really are just a fitness skate i.e. not good for tricks and not as tuff as an urban skate. I've heard good things about the Twisters the and the mens version is reviewed very well I would have got a pair of them myself but my local store doesn't stock them so I decided to get a pair of Seba High Lights.   I can't really comment on the Powerslides or the K2's
rollerblading,339sl6,jitsujay,1 point,Tue Apr 21 10:53:01 2015 UTC,"Hello, well I haven't skated all of those, but if you're looking to eventually do flat ground tricks then you would want hard shell boots as opposed to soft boots and wheels sizes typically 80mm and below(although this does not apply to those among us who happen to be Mushroom Blading skating wizards). So go for the Twisters.  Many slalom trick skaters use 74mm wheels and also banana/full rocker them which means they are mounted higher up on the frame if the frame allows or they are smaller wheels on the front and back (72mm would be the outside sizes in this example)to allow more maneuverability for tricks *BUT this is very unstable and you shouldn't have your wheels set up like this if you're going out for a casual skate."
rollerblading,339sl6,Largesaurus,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"Between those I'd say: Twister. Can't really go wrong with it as it's a very solid urban skate and (next to the Sebas) it's pretty much the standard goto freeskate.     However, you say you like riding long distances, if this means open roads/bike paths (as opposed to urban terrain) then you might want to consider a bigger wheel model (i.e. 90-110mm) but that might break your budget if you want a decent skate."

Aggressive skates are designed to grind on handrails and that's why people do it, but if you wanted a different answer to why single-trick rail grinds are so prominent in skate videos I'd say it's plainly a lack of creativity. Lots of skaters also probably have a predetermined idea of how an edit should be filmed and skated which mirrors in many ways how skateboard edits are filmed and skated. There isn't really a concept of lines and multiple switchups in skateboarding like there is in inline skating. And because most people putting out edits don't think outside the box of skateboarding limitations, you get edits very similar to skateboarding."

No.  You can't exactly do everything with aggressive skates, but you can do so much more than:  /skate edit hop onto rail, hop off. Good job, nice trick. /skate edit"

rollerblading,332oy1,Vulgar_Slaughter,3,Sat Apr 18 23:12:17 2015 UTC,I've gotten back into skating over the last year after being out for just over a decade. I skated Salomons before I quit so bought a pair or 2 when getting back into it.   A month or so ago I saw that Valo were releasing the blue impala so I bought them because they're just so damn pretty (them matching well in colour with my old GC's didn't hurt).   I found the USD VII's online second hand for £20 and I just had to have them. I previously bought the powerblade frames for one of my pairs of salomons after seeing the mushroom blading guys' videos.  So now I'm selling off my Salomons because I cant justify having 4 pairs of skates. Hell I can barely justify having 2 pairs because I'm not very good lol.
rollerblading,332oy1,Largesaurus,2,Sat Apr 18 23:19:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely think they are the best colour scheme of the v13s yet.   Fun fact: Wild impalas can jump ""a single leap as long as 30 feet and as high as 10 feet"", almost as high as Demetrios George!"
rollerblading,332oy1,autowikibot,2,Sun Apr 19 04:26:23 2015 UTC,"Impala:       The impala (Aepyceros melampus) is a medium-sized African antelope. It is the type species of the genus Aepyceros and belongs to the family Bovidae. It was first described by German zoologist Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein in 1812. Two subspecies of the impala have been recognised: the common impala (A. m. melampus) and the black-faced (A. m. petersi). They are typically between 120–160 cm (47–63 in) long. Males stand up to approximately 75–92 cm (30–36 in) at the shoulder and weigh 53–76 kg (117–168 lb), while females are 70–85 cm (28–33 in) and 40–53 kg (88–117 lb). Both are characterised by a glossy, reddish brown coat. Only the males have the characteristic slender, lyre-shaped horns, which can grow to be 45–92 cm (18–36 in) long.

If you're specifically looking at the Roces Majestic 12 skates as opposed to the ""new"" Valo V13s (which are the exact same skate shell), you should know that the stock frames that come with them would probably be out-dated. I think they also might be a bit narrower than the cults(but I really have no idea), and you can get cults as a complete setup with the new Ground Control frames right out of the box.  So just join the cult.Become one of us. One of us. One of us..."

Oxygens had a time and place in rollerblading, but they didn't make it out of the 90s. The real value to those skates is as a collectors piece especially if you went to the effort to clean up the boot a bit.   You've got a few options to consider, Razors Cult being my favorite price point skate for any skill level, but there's also the k2 fatty which will suit a beginner just fine, and USD is releasing the Sway soon, which I have not skated, but it looks like it will be a pretty decent price point option.

As you can see now, the grind plate on the side of your skates is built into the frames of modern skate frames, and though the soul plate sizes of skates vary, most are pretty much bigger than those. It's a major reason a lot of bladers have a lot of respect for the pioneers of the sport, because it was a lot harder to lock tricks on something like that.  Edit: Here's an idea of what modern soul plates look like, the ones on the right are Xsjado's, which are ridiculously huge, so those aren't the standard size for soul plates. http://i.imgur.com/CFR4Ln0.jpg Photo credit: /u/memento--mori"

Otherwise hit up AMall for some bolts and they will give you more than you'll ever need. Anti-rocker/freestyle takes a couple days or so to get used to if you don't skate it often. The biggest difference is how much you have to dig your feet into the ground to carve, and inversely how often you have to lift them for small turns/speed control. If you're comfortable learning the soul tricks and maybe front-ufo on a flat setup, by all means go for it."

rollerblading,32s90c,alksdjfd,2,Thu Apr 16 21:51:42 2015 UTC,I'd skate them more before you make the call.    I did end up cutting my Nils as I like that extra flex but I won't be trying gaps or halfpipes on them thats for sure (I'll use my Eislers for that).  The Nil's are incredibly flexy anyway so you may find you don't need it.
rollerblading,32s90c,hifire,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"In my experience with the hr1.3 (nils has a better liner than these, to ensure heel-lock mind you) and os4, I vastly prefer v-cut. Makes gaining speed on flat ground and slight inclines way easier, more power to your jumps, while making the cuff actually fit tighter. I ended up going cuffless on my hr's and using carbon2 cuffs on my os4, for perspective. Break them in a bit more before you decide though, as hifire said."

rollerblading,32rutk,PanzerKami,2,Thu Apr 16 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"Hope it works out. The Seba FR's should feel ""too tight"" when you first put them on, this is perfectly normal and they will break in quickly, in like 5-7 sessions. This is typical for this boot. After enduring the break-in period they will fit like a glove."
rollerblading,32rutk,ultimomono,2,Thu Apr 16 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely pay attention to this. Don't buy them with wiggle room. They feel best when they are really snug and broken in. If you misjudge the size, the shells accept different sized liners, so you can swap for a different size. The only thing I've had wear out on my Sebas (other than wheels) is the ratchety bottom strap, which is easy to replace. They are really fun, responsive multipurpose skates. You can drop in, skate in bowls,  down ramps, stairs, etc. They will take a beating."
rollerblading,32rutk,ultimomono,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:34:02 2015 UTC,"I looked at the sizing chart, measured my foot, got the size 11. It's a smidge longer (.3 inches) than my foot, but I didn't size up for my wider feet, so the fit should be very snug. Anything I should look out for while breaking them in?"
rollerblading,32rutk,NPC82,2,Fri Apr 17 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"If you've never skated in really stiff, hard boots, it might take a bit of getting used to at first. I remember having my doubts about it and I kept the top of the skate looser than I should have. Once they got broken in, I realized I could keep them very, very tight and they were still comfortable. At some point they start to feel like an extension of your body. It's always a downer to have to take them off and go back to having regular feet."

rollerblading,32qbbd,Agent_Bert_Macklin,3,Wed Apr 15 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I'd challenge you to give that Makio a try. It's the first grind I ever learned  and is incredibly easy. Remember, though, you'll need some speed, especially if your grinding surface isn't slick.  Go find a bike rack or a nice low ledge or curb, slap a coat or two of wax on it and then tear it up. You need speed for this kind of grind because there is a lot of surface area that will be in contact with the grinding surface, thus generating a lot of friction. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but the faster you go the safer the grind will be because it is always preferable to slide out then to stick and go flying forward.  Unlike on a skateboard, you can't just bail when you stick, so you need to make sure that you are going fast enough that it doesn't happen. Apart from that you should be good to go, and once you learn this grind it will open up the possibility of other soul-based grinds. Good luck."
rollerblading,32qbbd,ei8htpo1nt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"How necessary is the wax here? I get it supposed to make it easier for me as a beginner to land the trick, but would someone like you be carrying around wax for each grind?"
rollerblading,32qbbd,jokingrotten,3,Thu Apr 16 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"It's imperative. In the ideal case, you want the item that you're sliding upon to be essentially frictionless. If the surface is totally unwaxed and rough (eg, some random curb), your skate will stick to it. If you try a grind on a rough, unwaxed surface, you'll fall flat on your face.  Usually, sure. Keep in mind that you are applying an amazingly thin layer of wax, so a small candle could last you quite a while (tealight hype).  For learning grinds, you want to head to a ledge or rail with a smooth finish.... like some rails or ledges at the skatepark. Wood and smooth concrete can be slid upon after waxing, if no skatepark is available.  The makio is definitely a good grind to be learning first. if you looked it up, it's probably all dudes doing some way rad makios... you aren't interested in that, yet. For now, focus on getting the side of your skates onto that ledge or rail. I personally find jumping on to be easier than stepping on, even at first, but you can do either. Try to get your weight over the ledge/rail and stay on as long as possible!  As you get better, you can worry about grabbing your other foot or standing in weird positions... just keep in simple for now. It'll probably be scary as fuq for the first few times as is. Good luck dawg."
rollerblading,32qbbd,jokingrotten,2,Thu Apr 16 03:30:43 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for the great reply. I will definitely be trying it
rollerblading,32qbbd,HighRelevancy,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:37:10 2015 UTC,"One more question: so if I were skating around campus with my buddy after I have perfected my grinding and I saw a sweet rail, I shouldn't go jump on it because it isn't waxed? Or will I be able to grind on rougher surfaces the more experienced I am?"
rollerblading,32qbbd,jokingrotten,2,Thu Apr 16 04:47:40 2015 UTC,"As a rule of thumb, most bladers will prefer something that is maximally slipppery ie. waxed. However, you can leap on to things which are unwaxed... it's just more exciting.  Features can be grindable without wax, but wax will make the surface resistance a little more predictable. Almost ubiquitously, grinding is better with wax, though not impossible without.  But keep in mind: Wax doesn't magically disappear the moment your session ends. So if you waxed some ledge, then came back three days later, it's probably still totally skatable. Waxing usually takes less than a minute, so it's no like any huge time investment on your part.   WARNING: some skateboarders are quite anti-wax, and can badmouth you and be total pricks, so if you go to a skatepark to learn, try to pick a less popular feature in the park. If anyone gets aggressive, just point out that you tried to pick a less popular feature, and the park is for everyone.... that guy's a cock."
rollerblading,32qbbd,PatSayJack,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:37:15 2015 UTC,WARNING: some skateboarders are quite anti-wax   Because they can't slide on wax properly? :P
rollerblading,32qbbd,crabwalktechnic,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"yeah, essentially. I don't really get it.  Though I could see resistance on the rail let you more easily regain control of the board."
rollerblading,32qbbd,HighRelevancy,2,Fri Apr 17 02:47:14 2015 UTC,Porn Star or ANY grind if you can get your foot rocked up enough to get the wheels off the ground.  There are plenty of pros that can grind with a flat setup like you are describing.
rollerblading,32qbbd,ei8htpo1nt,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:49:06 2015 UTC,"You can try anti-rocker.  I had smaller feet when I started and had to use smaller wheels to grind.  The main difference you'll feel is when you apply a twisting force to your foot.  An anti-rocker setup doesn't rotate.  It feels like your wheels in stuck in a crack and if you want to turn your foot, you pick it up off the ground and turn it.  It does, however, give you more stability when landing.  You'll have to take a while to get used to how it feels but you can spend that time grinding!  You also could just replace your frame."
rollerblading,32qbbd,HighRelevancy,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:29:56 2015 UTC,I really don't think you'd want an antirocker setup on that frame.

rollerblading,32lq9u,aldolega,3,Wed Apr 15 08:15:10 2015 UTC,People have been topsiding with Cults just fine for 15+ years. Bend your knees.
rollerblading,32lq9u,brassneck,2,Wed Apr 15 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"Jump above whatever your trying to topside and come down on top of it, crouching into the topside position.  This can be made easier by crouching slightly on the approach  If you keep your centre of gravity above your blades and come down from above as opposed to jumping sideways and hoping it sticks, you should find that a lot of the time if it doesn't lock you'll just kind of cess slide a bit.  Top-Porn (for me at least anyway) is probably one of the safer topsides to try starting out."
rollerblading,32lq9u,furrdogg,2,Tue Apr 14 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"I started with top acids, some prefer top sunny days. Which ever you choose, stall it over and over. As already started, bend your knees! It took me years to be comfortable with top sides, ask about muscle memory."
rollerblading,32lq9u,Frostyblock,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:39:04 2015 UTC,I learned topsides by doing unity's then top acids because they are almost the same trick with the twist of a foot. everyone learns differently though.
rollerblading,32lq9u,crabwalktechnic,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:00:50 2015 UTC,"Top acids are the easiest because you can put your weight directly over your grind while top souls are kind of off to the side. If you can find a box with a rail on the corner rather than a 90° ledge, it will make the transition to topside easier. Also, you might have to work out your leg. Supporting your body is harder with your leg bent more so it takes more muscle than regular souls."
rollerblading,32lgls,Hiei_Havok,2,Tue Apr 14 19:07:39 2015 UTC,This is an interesting one.  I bought my pair of Nils before finding the info about them running a size small.    I wear a 10.5 sneaker so I bought a 10.5 skate and they fit absolutely perfectly.  Admittedly they were very snug when I first put them on but now that they are broken in they fit like a glove.  I would highly recommend trying a pair on if you can though just to be safe.
rollerblading,32lgls,hifire,2,Tue Apr 14 23:25:42 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting sz11 remz if you wear an 11 shoe. I wear a 12 shoe and the boot size is a liiiittle too big for me. 11 should fit you perfect. if they feel tight, just give them a bit to break in."
rollerblading,32lgls,thegigglepuss,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"REMZ skates run roughly 1 full size small, when ordering it is advised to up size, especially with the size 11 & up models, these skates have a narrow toe cap and extremely thick liners that take a long period of time to fully break in. The skates are more on the baseball glove type fit, the longer you skate them the better they skate, fit and feel. The Remz skate do have common shell sizing so you can swap liners between the recommended shell sizing. Remz skates tend to run wider on sizes 6-9 and narrower with larger (10-13) models.  REMZ shell sizing 1.(6-7)2.(8-9)3.(10-11)4.(12-13)"
rollerblading,32lgls,Johnpdickerson,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:19:06 2015 UTC,"I wear a size 8 shoe but usually go a size up for my casual wear so they're more comfortable on my wider feet, and the size 8 rem fits perfect on me, though there was about a week of break in before they were comfortable. Go with the 11."
rollerblading,32lgls,vaderprime923,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:01:56 2015 UTC,"I ordered a size 12 just got them this morning. i haven't broken them in yet, but they are pretty tight. i took the liners out and wore them a bit and twisted them up for a while while watching tv it seemed to get rid of the pressure point on my toe. i think after a couple days of skating they should break in the shell is kinda big but it should be alright. i'm just happy to be skating again. thanks for all the tips. if i buy another pair of Remz i'm deff gonna try true size. btw Nils Jansons is releasing his new 1.5 pro skate pretty soon. now if only i could find someone in my area to skate with."

rollerblading,32minb,glassnoodles,2,Wed Apr 15 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe, could always be slightly tight though. Try loosen it, or maybe just bring them back to the store and ask them?"
rollerblading,32minb,aSoberIrishMan,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:21:50 2015 UTC,So the axle is too tight? You should be able to tighten axles basically as tight as you want and the bearing spacer should keep things running freely.  Sounds like a shitty spacer (or bearing) maybe?
rollerblading,32minb,HighRelevancy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:55:32 2015 UTC,"I took it back to the shop today, and he loosened off the axle so it now runs smoothly. I just hope it's not too loose that it comes undone completely.."
rollerblading,32minb,HighRelevancy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:32:21 2015 UTC,Hmm :/ IMO you shouldn't have to loosen it off to fix that sort of problem. You really should be able to keep it fairly tight.
rollerblading,32i8f4,Dillawnz,4,Tue Apr 14 00:23:57 2015 UTC,"Smaller wheels may reduce your speed but they will also make you more likely to trip up on cracks. Perhaps practicing some technique might help? How to slow down comfortably. T-stops, etc. You can also bow your legs out and in, in a steady motion, to reduce speed slowly. Or do a shoot the duck if people are in the way so that they move out of the way or, more importantly, so that you are not only protected but slightly dangerous in case of impact, and in a stylish demeanor. Well, good luck. If I am rec skating around, I often will roll off into grass if I need to reduce my speed (definitely want larger wheels for that)."
rollerblading,32i8f4,PanzerKami,3,Tue Apr 14 01:24:51 2015 UTC,"Woo! Good stuff! I just went out to skate before this reply, but I definitely think doing the fundamentals (technique and stuff) helped. A 15 minute grass warm up helped with some balance issues. I'm already improving from last year and this is the first time out.  T-stops and speed control are things I should hammer in. Without those I don't think I'll be comfortable enough to skate around people and moving things."

rollerblading,32fguz,NewYorkCityGent,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"I love the sentiment but I think there are a lot more agg. bladers than 20k. Or at least who purchase blades. If the average pair of blades new is $350 USD and somebody buys a new pair once every two years then by your numbers the combined annual revenue for the sale of all agg. blades is $3,500,000 USD revenue (20,000*(350/2)) which seems extremely low to keep 6+ blading manufactures in business.  It is likely that there are a lot more than 20k bladers regularly buying agg. skates though. I wish the industry was more transparent and we knew more from the vendors about  aggregate  industry health.  I totally agree that training the youth is the way to get blading back in popularity. It's pretty common marketing knowledge that developing the highest LTV(life-time value) in a consumer is by starting when they're young! While I don't blade as much as I'd like since I started in '94 I still rid my remz when I can.  The sad part overall about blading's continuous low popularity is that the stars are aging out and are being replaced by folks who are great...but not as talented. In the early 2000's there seems to be dozens of new Nils level stars coming up all the time. For the most part, my personal opinion on today's new pros is that they are just not the level of Haffey, Bearagon, etc."

But I'm curious: 1) why do you think there are more than 20K rollerbladers worldwide? what would you base such a thing on... the ""6+"" skate manufacturers existing at the same time? Most pro models only get produced in runs of around 300 or so pairs. 2). An ""average"" skate has to be more like a $169 Razors Cult than a $350 pro model, wouldn't you think?  Also, don't forget that we live in the post apocalyptic blading world. There is a GIANT surplus of skating equipment--some of which is better than stuff currently available--and makes the market artificially small because so many people can get what they used for a fraction of retail price."

I would suggest that you choose, do you want to grind or not? If you want to do both then get two pairs of skates. Jack of all trades is master of none. I own both Xsjados with PB frames and Seba FR's and there is a huge difference in feel. The Sebas feel so light and agile compared to the Xsjados  (though they have other advantages)."

The amount of time it takes to put the skates on and off is something that might be a problem when I ride around campus, so I'll definitely get some xsjados at some point. I was originally thinking Id want to wear their footwraps to get the optimal fit, since I don't have much experience with how skates should fit, but with some time put into these frx's I think going the route of getting a skeleton frame from xsjados is what Ill end up doing."

rollerblading,32a66w,NPC82,5,Sat Apr 11 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"What skates do you currently own? You mention skateparks so I assume you've got a pair of aggressive skates. As long as they're UFS you'll be able to swap any UFS frame on and off. So to answer your question yes, any UFS boot is compatible with any UFS frame. Max wheel sizes vary from company and model but will be listed in the frame specifications on any skate shop website you buy from.  It sounds like you might be looking for a powerblading set up. The Kizer Advance Frame Kit linked will handle any transportation needs you could want with your aggressive boot then you'd just swap on your aggressive frame set up at the skatepark.  Here's our buyers guide which lists some pros and cons for most of the skate brand/models currently available on the market. That should give you a general sense of the differences between popular boot options."

rollerblading,32a66w,PanzerKami,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:08:10 2015 UTC,"Like Fart said, you could get a boot with UFS and two sets of frames/wheels, like the Kizer Adv and an aggro setup. However, there are some things to consider. I tried this approach and I found it to be great in theory and not so great in practice. It's not quite that quick an operation, you gotta remove at least two wheels to get the frame off and I for one can't be bloody bothered every time I want to do one thing or the other. Some may have that patience but I'd rather just have more skates :)    Also, consider that you could just get some freeskating wheels for your hockey skates if you like them (you seem to imply they have indoor wheels now). Some people use Hockey skates to great effect on the streets, given proper wheels. You'd still need something else for the park though."

rollerblading,327n2p,juicebox__hero,5,Sat Apr 11 07:48:08 2015 UTC,"Ice hockey 100%  For starters, there is the obvious benefit of keeping your skating muscles in good shape.  But in addition, hockey is such a fast sport, it forces you to be really quick on your feet and react super fast. After playing hockey, a trick in rollerblading feels like you have the luxury of time. If you have the puck in hockey, you have to make a decision of how to play it in a fraction of a second. I've planned blade tricks for weeks."
rollerblading,327n2p,Private_Stock,3,Sat Apr 11 18:54:18 2015 UTC,"This is a great example. In addition to learning technique, doing a sport long enough can instill a different mentality that could be useful in approaching other sports. Thanks for sharing!"

rollerblading,327n2p,Warkid1993,6,Tue Apr 14 14:28:26 2015 UTC,A little bit of parkour. I love vaulting over things on skates while spinning/sliding.

rollerblading,322c78,NoodleHoarder,6,Fri Apr 10 00:36:05 2015 UTC,Squats for sure. Anything to strengthen your legs really. Deadlifts would help work out the back as well. Do you run or do any other cardio type exercises? It might just be that you don't have as much stamina.
rollerblading,322c78,MN_MilkPlus,3,Fri Apr 10 01:45:57 2015 UTC,I used to run 4k three times a week at the treadmill but I haven gone to the gym since early december. I think I will go back next weeek.

rollerblading,322c78,that_tech_guy,3,Fri Apr 10 05:10:39 2015 UTC,Squats and deadlifts for sure. You should consider pistol (one legged) squats as well. I've found they've been helping me a lot with stability on one footed grinds.

If you could choose any company to work with on a ""Killa Cam"" signature product, and they were willing, would you donate some of the royalties/profits to research about head injuries?   Do you use a CPSC helmet, or one of the soft actually comfortable helmets?  What is your favorite blade pic ever."
rollerblading,3220a1,Vandebe,3,Thu Apr 9 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely drawn to physical fitness.  I think it’s important to live an active lifestyle.  Less sitting and more doing always seems to bring much more happiness to my life.  I currently don’t have a routine but am looking to find something that can lure me away from my bad habits of not stretching before and after activities.  Other then that I just stay active through hiking, biking, bladeskating, ice skating, climbing, frisbee, some at home workouts (pull ups, planking, etc..) and pretty much anything that get's my blood pumping and lungs breathing.  I’m not eating many sweets lately but when I eat ice cream I’ve been eating rocky road.  Back in the day it was mint chocolate chip.  I would love to donate to something that is educating people on head injuries and why helmets are so important.  And maybe support groups for people that have suffered from head injuries.  I don’t use a CPSC helmet but I’ve been looking into finding one that can somehow be comfortable.  If that can’t happen, I’d love to work with someone to design one that is.  I’m currently rocking a triple 8 soft helmet with the padded inserts.  Favorite blade pic ever… The first one that pops into my head is the Nick Riggle full pipe on fire DB cover."

rollerblading,3220a1,arnoldpalmerlemonade,3,Thu Apr 9 23:40:12 2015 UTC,Hey John and Thanks.  I am not currently on that setup but it was the last setup I rode that was under 72mm.  I had a 2r Plastik for the anti with a Don Bambrick Street Urethane as my tri and Eulogy Erik Baileys on the outside.  I do a lot more backside stuff so I put the anti on the back part.  The benefit of doing tri rocker for me would be having the best of both worlds.  Better for control and the awesome back royals with out wheel bite.  No news on ANW other then I didn't get a call back.  I had thought about trying to be a walk on but this year won't be the year for that.  Maybe next year!

Just wanted to say I'm really enjoying the content you've been putting out for Organic Bladeskate, the big wheel stuff and the ski edit. I never knew your skating style was this diverse!  So, the question; how did you decide on the name ""Organic"", and what does it mean to you?"
rollerblading,3220a1,jakeordie,3,Sat Apr 11 14:13:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks Jake,  Lately I've wanted to get into anything and everything.  Thanks for noticing.  The thought popped up while I was driving.  Lately my family and I have really been into eating organically.  We're trying to be more health conscious by knowing what we put into our bodies.  Anyways so organic came to mind.  I went home and looked it up and the first thing I pull up is this Wiki page. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic   After I read that I was convinced that Organic was a good way to describe what I want to do with rollerblading.  The definition to me is to not be afraid to be myself or follow my dreams.  It's about pushing past the walls I've put up over the years for really anything including rollerblading."

rollerblading,3220a1,cameroncard,3,Mon Apr 13 15:13:37 2015 UTC,This is a really hard question.  I think it would be a topsoul I did in the USD Legacy video.  It was a drop rail to c rail to five stair all connected.  I had previously gone there and tried it but couldn't make it all the way around.  Riding that whole rail was one of the best feelings I've ever gotten from rollerblading.

Early 2000's I was a kid looking to have a good time and followed what others were doing and now I'm an adult looking to have a good time but on my own terms.  So to me it's better now that I've got past the fact that I can do whatever I want on these things and still have a good time.  If I could go back in time I would have told my younger self to be me.  It's the secret to life.  Just being yourself and not worrying about pleasing others."

rollerblading,31s64h,Sonox,8,Tue Apr 7 19:16:45 2015 UTC,"-Razor wheels suck. Try a different brand. Also, T-stopping like you did will put flat spots in your wheels, so avoid it if you can.  -Liners break in just like everything else, but if the problem persists, look into getting some aftermarket liners. -Honestly, you might have to give it a few ""looks"" before you jump onto a handrail. And you are going to fall. You are going to eat shit and it will hurt. Just part of the game. But if you get comfortable trying tricks on lower rails first, you will have an easier time. That way you aren't trying to learn tricks on something as high as a handrail, but instead you are just adjusting to the height.  -Fuck other people man. Rollerblading hasn't been cool since about '99 in the opinion of most people. Who cares though. This isn't a sport you do for the approval of other people. This is a sport you do for yourself. Have fun with it. Sick skates man."
rollerblading,31s64h,PatSayJack,2,Tue Apr 7 20:41:18 2015 UTC,i was actually trying to jump onto lower rails... like 10cm high (~4 inches). Yeah i heard that the standard wheels are bad.. but that bad? :o - Thanks for the motivation man :)
rollerblading,31s64h,JTblademoney,3,Wed Apr 8 15:19:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to address some of these issues:   Hard wheels give more speed and are supposed to last longer, but can be slippery at a park.  Also, stock wheels that come with skates are generally crap.  I see your's came with Razor 56mm/90A wheels.  ""Razor Brand"" wheels are just cheap wheels with their logo printed on the side.  Also, that 90A rating is fairly hard for an aggressive wheel.  I prefer hard wheels because I have a really bad knee and they don't stick as much.  If I find my knee getting torqued in a way I don't like, I can slip out of it easier.  I can also go faster on ramps but get jiggly vision when I am riding on rough terrain. The stock liners are a similar situation.  They will break in a bit where you are having a problem, but after market liners are always going to be superior.  One trick I used to use is put a bandaid where I am being rubbed raw and it will get rubbed instead of your skin. Try jumping onto handrails in your sneakers.  Get used to the motion of jumping and get used to the feeling of being up on the rail.  If the rail feels too slick, lean farther forward down the rail.  Keep your shoulder weight in front of your feet.  I honestly got over my fear using Soap Shoes.  Once I was good at using those, rollerblades that lock in seem even easier. If they are laughing and saying you suck, the problem is with them.  Seriously.  As long as you aren't doing lame tricks while also being an attention whore than it is unwarranted.  They are also being fashion police for making fun of red skates.  That in and of itself is pretty lame, to be caught up in another guy/girl's fashion.  My advice in this situation is to get some ear buds and listen to music and ignore them as much as possible.  Also, don't show them that you are angry.  Smile when they make fun of you and play along.  If they realize they can't bother you they will get bored and/or realize how stupid they themselves are acting."

You could set yourself searching for a beginner/expert blader in X distance or just say you are going to X park and broadcast it to everyone who wanna come. Specifiy if you want to practice a particular move or feel more half-pipe/slide or any specific detail to the sport.

I just called them and they said they would be getting in the seba fr2 84 in the size I wanted pretty soon so I'll be getting those instead of the maxxums

rollerblading,31t8h5,raffraff89,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:26:36 2015 UTC,Would you rather have the 80mm wheel size or the 84mm?
rollerblading,31t8h5,jokingrotten,2,Wed Apr 8 16:24:56 2015 UTC,Not much difference. I would prefer 80 since there are more wheels to choose from in that size. If I wanted bigger wheels than 80 I'd go for 90.

We can't help you otherwise because Rollerblade skate designs vary by model and year.  Also be sure to check the box your skates came with, if there wasn't an extra axle bolt you won't be able to skate without buying a new axle."

rollerblading,31ogda,Vexore,3,Mon Apr 6 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"So after you tighten the wheels, using the palms of your hands, press them into the frame walls, and using your fingers, pull the wheels toward your palms.  And use your thumbs and press the wheels away from your palms. Try it, turn it a little, do it again, rotate the frame (otherside) and repeat. You'll likely hear some small clicks. Even though to your eyes the wheels and bearings seem aligned perfectly, they aren't, and it's using that force to keep them from spinning when you have them bolted tight. Put them on your skates and go for a roll as well. They will align correctly. This is almost always the culprit."
rollerblading,31ogda,Travis_Stewart,3,Tue Apr 7 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"You might have assembled the frames incorrectly.  The frame spacers (top hat looking things) pop into the frame's axle holes, from the inside of the frame. They might not stay in by themselves, you may have to hold the frame sideways (topside position basically), and hold the top spacer in with your finger until you get the wheel slid into place.  The bearing spacers (tube looking things) go inside the wheel, between the bearings. Make sure they don't flip sideways when you put the second bearing in. When you have the wheel in the frame and the axle slid into the first bearing, you will probably have to slide an allen wrench in from the other side to wiggle the spacer into place so the axle can slide the rest of the way through."
rollerblading,31ogda,aldolega,2,Tue Apr 7 05:01:36 2015 UTC,"Kaltiks are great frames with awful spacers. Just don't tighten them so much, they don't need to be over tightened. Spin the wheels as you tighten the bolts as soon as u see a change in speed of the spinning wheel you're all good, anymore will be to much. Good Luck."

rollerblading,31mq0f,chowaniec,3,Mon Apr 6 15:20:16 2015 UTC,Soul's a really safe one to learn. That or mizou seems to be most people's safety trick. Frontside isn't too hard either.
rollerblading,31mq0f,Nickburgesss,2,Mon Apr 6 15:34:39 2015 UTC,Hey I just started to.  I learned makio first.  Front sides are also pretty easy. Also a tip that helped me is get on top of your tricks more
rollerblading,31mq0f,that_tech_guy,2,Mon Apr 6 17:13:13 2015 UTC,Frontsides and mizous are my safety grinds. Personally I can't seem to get comfortable with souls but those are generally considered a good grind to start with as well.
rollerblading,31mq0f,jaymaslar,2,Mon Apr 6 20:00:34 2015 UTC,"Soul because it keeps the center of gravity more in your middle, followed by frontside; when learning frontside, I had my feet go out from under me a few times and then switched to learning soul which came much much easier.  Another factor might be what kind of skates you are riding."
rollerblading,31mq0f,Neo_Viking,2,Tue Apr 7 00:42:06 2015 UTC,I learned frontside first and then soul. From there I moved to mizou. It's all about getting comfortable and then breaking that comfort with minor trick alterations.

If you can't find bladers in your area through facebook, here, etc then i'd recommend at least try to blade every once in a while. Get a p rail, blade around town. Do anything to keep you familiar with the sport. Eventually you'll find someone and your solo sessions will be worth it. Also blading with skateboarders is ok too."

rollerblading,31ii5f,jopeymonster,2,Sun Apr 5 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"This one says Doop, which is a great choice for size.  My only hesitation is that they may not be supportive enough.  You are a bigger skater and will need something that response really well.  Because of the shell design, the Doops may not offer this, but that really depends on how you skate.  I have a pair of Doop freestyles and swifts, and like them a lot, so I'm not trying to talk you out of them or shooing holes in this suggestion.  This is just my experience"

Not all models are available in larger sizes, but if you call around to retailers, you might find someone able to get it for you.  Rollerblade may be an option, as they have expanded their urban offerings this year.  New Roces will be coming out soon so you might find something in their lineup this year that functions closer to what you want.

rollerblading,31hvnv,SWBoards,7,Sun Apr 5 05:44:14 2015 UTC,"The blading community is one that embraces people of any skill level. It's one of the best communities in that respect.

As for grinding rails, being confident that you'll lock it, and being confident that if you don't you won't die are two big ones. also stay crouched"

rollerblading,31hvnv,gypsyblader,5,Thu Apr 9 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"The way I figured it out was to skate a little faster than I was comfortable with (more airtime) to give plenty of time to get your feet into position.   Skate up to it, hop off both feet (jumping off your toes may help with the height), bend your knees, square your shoulders up over the rail, lock it, spot the end of the rail and surf it out.  Don't be afraid to try a longer rail. Shorter rails can kind of be a death sentence because there's less to catch yourself with if you miss your trick."
rollerblading,31hvnv,olskeevi,3,Sun Apr 5 15:39:21 2015 UTC,"The advice that always helped me was to pretend you're jumping OVER the rail.

rollerblading,31g6c1,brokenstep,4,Sat Apr 4 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"Powerblade = An aggressive boot with large (72-80mm) wheels flat, in a UFS frame (usually plastic to make grinds slide well). Some powerblade frames even have a groove and h-block, which makes grinding much easier than without. See: any aggressive boot, with Kizer Arrow/Advance/LevelII/LevelIII, Ground Control BIG, etc. frames.  Freestyle = a frame/wheel setup for aggressive skates. Two wheels only, no wheels in the middle. You can technically ride freestyle in any frame (just take the middle wheels out), but usually this setup is done with a dedicated freestyle frame which has a larger/wider grinding area. See: Kizer M-Type or X-Type (aka Mook), Kaltik freestyles, Creates with G-Blocks, GC FLT or F1 freestyles, etc.  Freeskate = A skate designed for quick maneuvering, urban skating, some light jumping and stair bashes, maybe some slalom stuff. Usually a slightly beefier, stiffer rec skate with a short, possibly rockered 80mm frame. This term can be used pretty broadly though, and can cover everything from a more speed-oriented 90mm skate to a borderline-powerblade setup. See: most Seba models, RB Twister and Fusion models, etc.  For skating the 5 miles every day you absolutely do NOT want a freestyle setup. You will only trip, slide, stick, and stumble your way to class... very slowly. You will want a 72mm+ wheel flat for distance. This could be a dedicated rec or freeskate, or a powerblade frame setup on an aggressive boot that you also use for tricks. If doing tricks will be limited to dedicated skatepark sessions, it won't be hard to switch to a more appropriate frame before you leave."

rollerblading,31g6c1,PROFESSIONAL_FART,3,Sat Apr 4 22:27:54 2015 UTC,As long as the 80mm frame is UFS (universal frame system) compliant you can put it on any other UFS aggressive boot.

rollerblading,31g6c1,wildtalon,2,Sun Apr 5 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"yeah if you're:  trying to keep it cheaper  and   skating 5km a day  then the seba FRA is probably your best bet.  However, depending on the skate park you frequent, it is totally possible to enjoy it without grinding at all. Jump lines, bowls, transfers, etc. can keep you occupied for quite a while. If you dont feel grinds are required, the FRX would fit that niche for a fair bit cheaper than the FRA. But then again, grinding is tight as fuck... so it probably comes down to how much you can spend vs if your skatepark has a bowl and ramps of some kind."
rollerblading,31g6c1,wildtalon,2,Sat Apr 4 20:38:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry, are you talking about an aggressive boot with powerblade frames vs. A freeskate? Or do you mean a flat, 8 wheel setup vs. a setup with only 4 wheels on the ground."

rollerblading,31g6c1,Warkid1993,2,Sat Apr 4 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the difference between a freeskate setup and an aggressive setup with powerblade frames is pretty negligible. Carbon fiber aggressive skates and xsjados might even outperform a lot of freeskates.   There's not a huge weight difference, and it sounds like you want the option of doing park stuff so I'd get xsjados if I were you. You can skate to school and then undo the bindings and walk to class without putting shoes on; and throw on aggressive frames if you want to do grinds."

Unfortunately you rarely find good inline equipment from a big box store, in the 90s it was a different case altogether but it's not as popular as it once was so in order to get a good deal without sacrificing selection most bladers shop online. Here's a good amount of adjustable skate options for boys from one of our recommended inline skate shops. Just stay away from the Luigino skates. A speed skate is too advanced for a first time blader! (assuming you aren't on a mobile app a full list of recommended shops can be found at the top of this subreddit listed under the ""buyers guide"" drop down tab)  Most every online skate shop has excellent return policies, and I know it'll be a major bummer for a young kid to deal with having to send something back if there are any issues but you should consider at the very least picking a model online, seeing if they have it at your local sporting goods store, and if not, just order it online. They're adjustable so I'm really not sure you'd have size issues anyway!  Here are a few additional options to consider.  Seba jr.

rollerblading,31bgav,Vandebe,3,Sat Apr 4 06:00:58 2015 UTC,There were definitely a few moments that my jaw dropped
rollerblading,31bgav,Travis_Stewart,2,Fri Apr 3 19:28:07 2015 UTC,Im 16... Good thing Eisler didn't become really pro for awhile.
rollerblading,31bgav,Tromance,2,Sun Apr 5 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"Here's my 2 cents about this kid. Incredible skills for sure, but I think Aragon was light years ahead of this kid at 16, Aragon skated fast as fuck at EVERYTHING no matter street or park, this collection of clips really only shows him skating fast in parks, which is still a good thing, but to truly be compared to bearagon you really need to step up your speed game. And I'm happy as fuck that a 16 year old is that good at misty flips."
rollerblading,31bgav,cwohl00,6,Sun Apr 5 13:40:16 2015 UTC,"Misty flip to grabbed true fish. Wow. Holy shit.   And another misty flip. Woah.   And another misty flip. Oh.   And a misty 900. Oh cool.   And misty off a gap. Right. Looked like a BJ...  But at least he spins both ways, so he's got that going for him which is nice."
rollerblading,31bgav,Travis_Stewart,5,Fri Apr 3 16:00:48 2015 UTC,"In fairness, if I were that good at misty flips, I'd be doing them all the time as well."

rollerblading,31dpjp,juicebox__hero,2,Sat Apr 4 03:00:52 2015 UTC,Are you looking for aggressive or rec skates?
rollerblading,31dpjp,youkai1,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I'm absolutely 100% new to this whole thing. What is the difference between them? I'm sure the ones I had were rec skates, so I might just be ready to move on up to aggressive skates..."
rollerblading,31dpjp,youkai1,2,Sat Apr 4 02:48:15 2015 UTC,Its all good.  If you want to be able to do tricks like grinds and jumps you want aggressive skates.  For an absolute beginner I would suggest these two:  USD Realm http://www.aggressivemall.com/USD-Realm-Skates-p/usd-skate-realm-14.htm  or   Rollerblade Swindler http://www.aggressivemall.com/Rollerblade-Swindler-Skate-p/rb-skate-swindler.htm
rollerblading,31dpjp,MenacingVitamin,-3,Sat Apr 4 11:06:59 2015 UTC,"sorry to be that guy, but jesus, dude..."
rollerblading,31dpjp,Dunescha,2,Sat Apr 4 05:22:10 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it really depends on how you want to use your skates.   To simplify it as much as possible; if you want to do tricks, grinds and go to skateparks, look at an aggressive skate. (hard shell, small wheels, H-block, grind plates)  If you just want to skate around trails, streets, bomb hills and get speed, then i'd recommend a rec/'freeskate'/powerblade setup. (hard [lasts longer] or soft boot [cheaper], big wheels)  Your best bet is to pillage youtube for skate videos ('USD skates', 'AuthenticRollerblade', 'PintoPonyProductions' are a good starting point) and decide which style you want to pursue and then head to a local supplier if possible to see how different skates feel on your feet.  Rollerblade, Seba, Powerslide, K2, Razors, USD, Valo are a few reputable brands to look out for.  You get what you pay for with inline skates, and it's generally worth it in the long run to pay a bit more for a better skate that will last you a decade than a cheap one that wears out in a year."
rollerblading,31dpjp,fishyboner,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:04:42 2015 UTC,Wow. Thanks for this massive response. This is extremely helpful. I guess what I'm looking for are aggressive skates. I'll be sure to check out those YouTube channels after work.
rollerblading,31cp60,ReiReim,4,Fri Apr 3 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"For me, the gateway into switchups was simple: fronstide to alley oop soul. If you have both these grinds down, it is an easy way of getting comfortable moving one foot while grinding. Get the motion down before you worry about doing it in the middle of the rail."
rollerblading,31cp60,polskimoose,3,Fri Apr 3 23:38:37 2015 UTC,I was actually just about to comment on how switchups don't count unless you move both feet.  Try Back-royale to a\o soul. Back Farv to soul. etc.
rollerblading,31cp60,youkai1,2,Sat Apr 4 00:31:00 2015 UTC,Royale to ao topsoul has always been one of my favorites.
rollerblading,31cp60,timwoj,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:14:11 2015 UTC,Had a friend tell me this when I first started out because I was doing soul to front royales. He said if those count then soul to mizou soul to mizou would count and nobody wants to see that ha! One footed switch ups could be a good starting point to get used to moving from one trick to another though.
rollerblading,31cp60,jaysuperdavehenson,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:46:49 2015 UTC,"all about them rewinds. unless you mean back royal to tru soul, thats always a solid switch up, and makes tru spin tricks good practice when you're switching up into them."
rollerblading,31cp60,myusernamesalwayssuc,1 point,Sat Apr 4 08:09:25 2015 UTC,"I've heard people say that a switch up doesn't REALLY count unless your shoulder position changes as well, kinda makes sense, top soul to mizou is pretty boring. Nothing wrong with doing switch ups that ""don't count"" if you're just learning though.  my go-to basic/easy switch ups;  x-grind to back unity  top acid to back royale  soul to soyale (because I do both of those tricks on the same side)"
rollerblading,31cp60,brassneck,3,Sat Apr 11 00:44:49 2015 UTC,Soul to backside unity is a good switch up to start with. All you have to do is flick your feet to the left (Assuming you're right footed) and lock in your h blocks. If you aren't comfortable with unitys try soul to back full torque instead.

rollerblading,318gay,Travis_Stewart,3,Thu Apr 2 23:33:27 2015 UTC,a lot of those skates are plastic /cf shells with cloth glued to them... not really a soft shell
rollerblading,318gay,Vulgar_Slaughter,2,Fri Apr 3 01:02:02 2015 UTC,Well you did name adapt which falls under the exact same category.
rollerblading,318gay,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:18:43 2015 UTC,"not really.. adapts shell is as minimal as possible. it's similar to the Valo light shell except it's used to form a ""soft boot""...similar to remz and I assume k2?  as far as USD goes they don't offer any tech info so I'm assuming they just glue fabric to a shell... making a cheap adapt ;)"
rollerblading,318gay,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:42:39 2015 UTC,But the deshi/usd carbon came before the adapts did. So how are they making a cheap adapt?

rollerblading,318gay,raffraff89,2,Fri Apr 3 00:10:00 2015 UTC,The inner boot is exactly like a Remz skeleton.
rollerblading,318gay,jokingrotten,3,Fri Apr 3 01:19:55 2015 UTC,And why the hell do people ask to do a backflip?
rollerblading,318gay,raffraff89,3,Fri Apr 3 00:59:49 2015 UTC,"i have a pair of doop freestyle 2014s and hard boots. I'd say go with the hard boots if you're just starting but something like a nice xsjado powerblade set up seems hard to beat too.   the learning curve is a lot steeper for soft boots i believe though because it's a lot easier (in my opinon) to sustain some type of ankle injury. the support just isn't there. I love my doops, really, it lets me skate with ANY of my friends because I can roll hard boots and give them the doops to mess around with but if I switched out for a powerblading set up I wouldn't trust my ankle with them."
rollerblading,318gay,jokingrotten,3,Thu Apr 2 22:40:56 2015 UTC,doops are exactly xsjado 2.0s with powerblade frames.
rollerblading,318gay,BurnMeInTheStars,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:19:04 2015 UTC,They have a raised heel baseplate and come with a choice of frames. Not really what I'd call powerblade frames.
rollerblading,318gay,hifire,1 point,Fri Apr 3 09:44:13 2015 UTC,"this and this dont look similar to you? Note the fact that xsjados have a thick shock absorber in the heel, which puts the foot in an almost identical position as the doop skate boot (while raised, it does not sport a similar beast of a shock absorber).  I just assumed that you'd be rocking the 80 or 84mm frame, in which case you're pretty much power blading. Certainly those three wheeled 110mm frames would perform totally differently.  This is not to badmouth doop skates in any way... They're almost certainly excellent skates! I merely disagree that they are much different from xsjados."
rollerblading,318gay,youkai1,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:17:35 2015 UTC,I think it's a push to call doops powerblades. To me powerblading is grinding with 72+mm wheels. Otherwise it's very confusing to newcomers who aren't necessarily interested in grinding.  I've not tried Doops but I skate Xsjados with 80mm wheels and they feel very flat to me compared to my raised-heel skates.
rollerblading,318gay,wildtalon,2,Fri Apr 3 18:31:01 2015 UTC,perhaps i am wrong then. Thanks!

rollerblading,313jsi,juicebox__hero,3,Thu Apr 2 04:42:07 2015 UTC,"they may be good skates but the hype is a result of the rarity... sumed up nicely ""you want what you can't have""."
rollerblading,313jsi,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu Apr 2 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the rarity bumps interest. If it were truly a simple matter of the boot itself you'd have a lot more people snagging the Bladerunner Fury and the new RB Swindlers to mod.  I loved the Salomons I owned and if I come across a pair in my size I'd probably buy them to do a symetrics mod but truth be told the only blader I ever skated with who really looked good riding Salomons in the early 2000's was Dan Barnes."

rollerblading,313gwg,Hollow_Ling,6,Wed Apr 1 19:11:03 2015 UTC,"I started 5 months ago so I'm new to the sport myself. Where did you fall? I think it's very important to chose the right obstacle for your first steps. For grinding you should look for a curb thats about knee high or higher. Don't choose very low curbs. A higher curb forces you to get low on the obstacle and bend your knees so you will have more balance. If you fall towards the obstacle you can catch yourself with your arms and your feet will slip on the ground. Try always to get your weight ontop of the curb and don't lean back. For soul tricks I started to do makios because you can always step off the rail if you lose your balance. As soon as you're save with locking in your soul foot and getting your full weight on it, you can place your second foot for mizou and soul grind. Try to do all the grinds standing and jumping onto the obstacle, locking in an jumping off first. It's much easier if you're confidend you can land it right on your first tries. Always wear kneepads and wristguards, not only to be safe but to feel save.  But the most important part is to learn to be a good skater, not only a good grinder. I practically spend all my childhood on blades playing hockey so freestyle skating feels natural to me. It helps me a lot to avoid falling and landing on my feet. You should be able to skate backwards, do sharp turns, ride on one foot as long as you want, roll on two wheels (in every variation), jump and land on one foot and jump over obstacles. This won't help you learning how to grind and probably doesn't do that much skating ramps but it will improve your balance, your confidence and your style."
rollerblading,313gwg,FiscHwaecg,2,Wed Apr 1 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I've been working on my skating over the winter a lot so I'm pretty confident in how I skate normally. I was trying to grind on a pretty low box (Guess I should have gone with a slightly higher one lol) I fell forwards a lot and when I landed on rear end it was mostly cause I was trying to shift myself to the box when trying to do a soul (ended up with the edge in between my cheeks at one point sadly) to avoid falling on the ground. Right now my biggest regret is not starting years ago (Currently 19) and that my skates don't come with an emergency eject button."
rollerblading,313gwg,FiscHwaecg,3,Wed Apr 1 20:09:19 2015 UTC,I'm 26... don't make me feel old! Why did you fall forward? Wheelbite? Did your soul get stuck? You should probably use a little wax.
rollerblading,313gwg,youkai1,2,Wed Apr 1 20:18:01 2015 UTC,lol mostly wheel bite when trying a backslide and for my soul attempts it was a mixed bag mostly caused my not putting enough weight on my off foot.
rollerblading,313gwg,Morbidgrass,5,Wed Apr 1 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"the more falls you take, and there will be many, the more conditioned your body will become to falling.  And you'll figure out ways to fall a bit more gracefully so they won't be a big deal.    Best pieces of grinding advice I could give anyone are: 1: Do not skate parallel to the obstacle but at an angle towards it. this way when you jump you'll continue moving in that direction and land directly on top of the ledge / rail as opposed to next to it.  frontside, backside, normal, topside - you ALWAYS want all of your weight directly over what you're trying to grind.  2: best way to prevent wheelbite is to bend your knees and get lower on grinds.  for a backside grind for instance, imagine trying to lift your frames off the railing so that only the frontside grooves on your skates are touching the bar.    those two will take you a long way."
rollerblading,313gwg,hifire,2,Thu Apr 2 00:14:40 2015 UTC,Hey at least you are falling on your ass and not hurting your wrists. Learning to fall is good.

When I used the long spacer as a test, I tightened the screw until it was flush against the blade frame, but the wheel didn't spin as long as it did when the screw wasn't as tight. Is that ok?  Thank you again for taking the time to read and respond :)"
rollerblading,3134a4,raffraff89,3,Wed Apr 1 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"It's not a big problem, most people probably skate their bearings like that. You can solve it sometimes by getting more expensive 'precision' spacers, but the benefit will depend on how precise your other parts are too."
rollerblading,3134a4,Nieros,2,Wed Apr 1 20:25:55 2015 UTC,"as long as there's not much lateral movement on the wheel, I'm sure it's fine.  One of these days I'm going to invent an axle system that takes all the guess work out of that...  It always annoyed me that you could bind the bearings like that."
rollerblading,3134a4,Vandebe,3,Wed Apr 1 20:07:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for your help. I replaced the wheel/bearing set last night. Only tightened the axles until they didn't move side to side. Wheels still had free spin.  Thanks again :)
rollerblading,3134a4,youkai1,2,Thu Apr 2 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"Here's my 2 cents. The spacer strictly keeps the axel from squishing the bearing I to the hub of the wheel. Dosnt matter which style you use. As far as tightness, tighten those axels as much as you can, unless you see it start to affect how the wheel spins"
rollerblading,3134a4,Vandebe,3,Wed Apr 1 18:54:55 2015 UTC,the spacer definitely matters.  if he puts his new bearing spacer (8mm) on his current frame with 6mm axels he'll have all kinds of play in the wheels.  Always use a bearing spacer thats properly sized for your frame hardware.
rollerblading,3134a4,youkai1,2,Thu Apr 2 00:21:29 2015 UTC,"So what he is describing (now that I read it again) does sound like a 6mm spacer. I was thinking he was talking about the sleeve like spacer versus the Saturn type spacer. I know K2 still uses a 6mm axel in the Fatty and the Varsity, and if the Il Capo has 6mm I'll be very disappointed."
rollerblading,311hl5,FiscHwaecg,3,Wed Apr 1 10:37:21 2015 UTC,"I have found that everyone is different. I snowboard regular but frontside goofy. I soul with my right foot. For the longest time, I was trying to royale goofy since I frontside thay way. On a whim I switched it up (so that my torqued foot was the same as my soul foot) and it locked right in.  I also have a friend that souls left, but does any other soul tricks right (but he also royales with his left).  If it makes you feel better, it took me about 20 years of skating (with a lot of hiatus time) to figure this out... just two weeks ago. I just thought I sucked at royales.  I'm also not that amazing. Someone else may have way better advice."

rollerblading,311hl5,Morbidgrass,3,Thu Apr 2 00:24:00 2015 UTC,"Your strong side is just what feels right for you and that can vary depending on the trick. For instance, I learned true mizou's and top acids with my left foot in the soul position despite my right foot being my natural inclination.  I also learned and still feel most comfortable doing back royales with my right foot trailing, despite preferring front royales, farvs, and any other h-block oriented tricks with my left foot trailing.  This has caused some confusion in the past during games of B.L.A.D.E. when trying to explain why some tricks are switch for me, especially since I've long since learned to do most things both ways."

rollerblading,311hl5,stickity,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:34:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing the experiences. I will accept my awkwardness then. One of the most interesting parts of skating is that everyone seems to have a different learning progress depending on the local skatepark/ spots and preferences. I feel like i'm really good at learning soulgrinds and I don't fear stepping into topside territory in a few weeks. But those H-Block based Grinds scare the shit out of me. And then I met a guy who skated for 15 years and told me his first trick he learned was a royale. But it took him a year to do soul based grinds.

rollerblading,310mq4,Travis_Stewart,2,Wed Apr 1 15:32:54 2015 UTC,Kinda cruel of you to introduce this at the one time of the year where outright deceit is permitted for kicks and giggles... But there's been too much effort put into this.  Pretty ambitious expectations of the wheels you're going to make. Any chance there will be a version with larger/fewer wheels?
rollerblading,310mq4,provokerolling,4,Thu Apr 2 03:03:05 2015 UTC,"Couple more tidbits. 58mm 57mm max wheel size currently (57's will fit, but the new 55's provoke will be producing are designed specifically for this frame). Fitting a larger wheel doesn't fit in the position 2 or 3 slot with the center hblocks between 1-2 and 3-4. Non replaceable components, so one frame, no h-blocks. Aluminum spacers in the frame walls, and 8mm standard hardware. Chynna has been on the very first prototypes for the last two weeks and the new edit drops this Friday. I should have a pair of the prototypes in my hand in the next few weeks. I'm excited to see where this goes and for people like Dustin Jamieson who use the toe and heal grooves. Now I gotta step up and learn Melanie's again. Currently they only have one physical pair of these frames in existence (like the one pair of CRS frames they had in the beginning). The CADs you can see are the fifth revision we've made, and Chynna is riding on version three. We wanted to get a pair to PowWow but they hadn't arrived yet. The first pair are white, but the final product will likely come in white, red, black, and grey. Fart has been working more closely with Jeff then myself on these and the announcements. It's a super exciting frame and innovation and I'm really looking forward to getting a pair and skating them proper.   And no, they aren't the first to do triple hblocks, but they are the first UFS version to do them."
rollerblading,310mq4,jaysuperdavehenson,2,Wed Apr 1 04:55:26 2015 UTC,We are still fine tuning wheel size. 55mm seems to be the sweet spot for this design. 57's were a bit too snug and would rub the frame until it ground a bit of it down. That's not ideal. It's all millimeters too so getting a wheel down to the exact size can be troublesome. I think 55/56 mm is where we will end up but testing is still in progress. More to come. I'll come by to answer any questions tomorrow.
rollerblading,310mq4,jaysuperdavehenson,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:28:38 2015 UTC,"Dude, Dustin would KILL these frames. I legitimately thought of an idea like this when I was a kid but thought it to be too unrealistic. Never thought I'd see something like this tho, provoke thought outside the box. How does the grinding affect balance since the front and back h-block are not centered on your feet?"
rollerblading,310mq4,Largesaurus,2,Wed Apr 1 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"How does the grinding affect balance since the front and back h-block are not centered on your feet?   Just as you'd imagine it would, to be honest. Some tricks are going to be easier than others but this should introduce a huge amount of new variation to rollerblading tricks. I've taken to referring to tricks in this manner: Soul grind (i.e. a soul grind done in the normal h-block groove) over-soul (h-block closest to your heel) and under-soul (h-block closest to your toes.)  Each takes some getting used to, and for instance, an under-royale seems next-to-impossible the first time you think about these frames, but after a few sessions on a practice rail you should feel pretty damn comfy with the new grooves."
rollerblading,310kvu,xHelios,3,Wed Apr 1 04:17:51 2015 UTC,Just keep at  it and they'll continue to break in and loosen.  If that doesn't work try some size 9.5 liners.

Some people toe cut their Valos or base cut to allow more room for toes... this probably causes a loss in support and structural integrity of the skates. i d k i havent done it.  I did, however, buy Spec Ops Trust liners and it seemed to help a bit but I am back on stock liners and they definitely seem somewhat more comfortable after breaking in. I didn't like Spec Ops split tongue design much and it didnt fit as well as the stock liners in my skate... but it's definitely a lot more comfy"

rollerblading,30yov0,memento--mori,3,Tue Mar 31 19:50:47 2015 UTC,So much room for activities!  I'm with the camp that says they're a bit too big - not cheating but too big to be comfortable.  I like to lean over a ledge a bit more than these souls allow.    Topside really shouldn't make a difference since you're grinding mostly on your frames anyway (if you're doing them properly).  All that said though - I just bought a pair of xsjados.  Enjoy! Looks like a huge upgrade from anything that has -- gasp grindplates?!  Welcome to the 2000's.
rollerblading,30yov0,youkai1,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:17:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I wear a size 6 so most skates my size have very small soul plates.

rollerblading,30yov0,jaysuperdavehenson,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:17:40 2015 UTC,I have always and always will consider xsjados cheater skates. Souls so big its near impossible to not lock your trick.
rollerblading,30yov0,jaysuperdavehenson,2,Tue Mar 31 21:09:32 2015 UTC,Really? I've always thought the soul was a little TOO big. Made it more difficult to lean into soul tricks on ledges. Though to each his own.  Calling someone's skate a cheater skate kind of sounds like a poor sport thing to say ;)
rollerblading,30yov0,Stickeesox,-1,Tue Mar 31 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I used to have the old Vinny Minton style deshi's with xsjado soul plates, and I noticed a huge boost in my trick abilities. It was like using a game genie with rollerblades. Slid a little slower, but I would hardly ever miss locking any top trick on any obstacle, especially ledges and quarters."
rollerblading,30yov0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,5,Tue Mar 31 22:01:16 2015 UTC,"Round wheels? Them's are cheater wheels. If it works better, why use something else. If it has drawbacks, then it can't really be said to be better can it. It's just an alternative. (Says the guy with the Xsjados flair)    Though they are definitely too big for me. Great for learning. I can't for the life of me feel comfortable on those roces plates, which were my first skates."

Slid a little slower, but I would hardly ever miss locking any top trick on any obstacle, especially ledges and quarters.    That's just a pair of soul plates that serves their intended purpose, wouldn't you say? You're actually repeating arguments from around '95 by people who thought anti-rocker wheels were cheating because it made grinding easier and only 8 down counted. It's just a repackaged argument, so I hope you're skating flat, because if not you're cheating by some standards.  My point is, don't worry about what hardware counts and just skate. Xsjado souls don't make you Farmer any more than small souls legitimize you."
rollerblading,30yov0,PROFESSIONAL_FART,-1,Wed Apr 1 00:49:59 2015 UTC,"I would say it's more about preference and ability. Like training wheels on a bike.

Anti rockers, big souls, big wheels, big frames, soft boot, hard boot, whatever you want to think sure, in some way you can consider it cheating in it's own way. I consider big souls cheating in the realm of locking tricks. other than that, they are just like any other skate."

rollerblading,30z1wd,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Neither of those come with removable brakes and extra axles (you can take them off, but it looks like one of them might need to be cut out and you'll need extra axles for both). Which is not surprising. Sub $100 skates are pretty no-frills and honestly I don't recommend them to anyone if they can help it. Even spending an extra 50-70 dollars just to get a higher tier skate is a huge jump in quality that will benefit you in the short and long term. K2 is a great brand but those particular models are rather low end.  Since you said you're athletic, I'll explain it this way. You could go running in a pair of converse chuck taylors, but you'd probably be a lot more comfortable, and therefore more likely to keep running daily, if you bought a mid-range running shoe.  The same applies for inline skates. Priced at or below $100 generally does not get you a skate intended for serious use of any kind. They're meant absolutely as a beginner skate and you'd likely be replacing them within a single season anyway if you stick with blading.  I'd be happy to help you pick out a skate, but I wanted to get this out of the way first, and give you a chance to see if you'd prefer to invest a little more for a skate you'll probably be much happier with. If you want to stick with $100, that's fine too. You do have options, but like I said earlier in this post, even just upping your budget to between $150-$170 can really improve the quality of materials in the skate you'd be purchasing."

rollerblading,30vgjv,Vandebe,2,Tue Mar 31 17:24:52 2015 UTC,"It varies. To save money most companies make the plastic shells that span several sizes (usually two) and then just put a different liner (the soft part) inside. You might want to take a look at XSJADO/DOOP, which are skates you just put your shoes inside; it's an easy way to get a skate that fits right!"

Stick with the stock setup and as your wheels wear down swap them with Eulogy. As you get better at grinding and want to slide faster get some new frames (kizer has been good for a long time, I've always been partial to GC).  Etc.  The liner is pretty solid - you shouldnt ever really NEED to replace it."

The FR2 has the same shell as the FRX but better frames, a snowboard style buckle (vs. velcro) and perhaps better bearings.

rollerblading,30l7bw,jokingrotten,2,Sun Mar 29 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"fr1 vs fr2 - only difference seems to be the bearings.... pretty much the exact same skate.  2012 vs 2014 - seba redesigned the toe of the skate. The 2012 model is better for a narrower foot, while later years are better for a wider foot, I believe. The photos from the side make this change essentially invisible. edit: after some looking, it looks like they all use the same, newer shell... assuming those photos are indeed of the 2012 skate.  fr1/fr2 vs frx - fr1/fr2 have a buckle, nicer bearings and maybe a nicer frame?"

rollerblading,30l7bw,jokingrotten,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:40:17 2015 UTC,"I personally think that that is a problem that permeates rollerblading as a whole.... But back to the discussion at hand.  It's possible, if the article was comparing the gtx to the gt90 (or any other skate with a larger wheel size), that he might say that the gtx was worse on bumps. In this case, obviously this is a true statement; the gtx has a smaller wheel size.  But such a quote, if used in a comparison of two 80mm wheel skates, would almost certainly be incorrect.  Could this have happened?"

rollerblading,30l7bw,raffraff89,2,Wed Apr 1 20:55:28 2015 UTC,My friend has the FR Juniors which are pretty much the same as the FRX but with smaller frames/wheels. The only aspect of them that I think is a shame is that the axle bolts are very poor quality so you need to be very careful not to round them out. It doesn't help that they came ridiculously tight out of the box. We nearly wrecked some while taking the brake off.  FR2 has the better axles and frames.

rollerblading,30f5rm,TWOiii,2,Thu Mar 26 22:53:42 2015 UTC,Creates are a good choice too but I've seen several sets bend at the groove. May have just been a batch issue though because others have had great luck with them.
rollerblading,30f5rm,JD_Hacksaw,3,Thu Mar 26 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"Kaltiks are probably your best bet. You can squeeze up to a 62mm into them I believe, even with 60's or 61's you'll have a decent glide for skating around, and the groove covering the inner wheels will keep grinding fairly easy.  I personally like the Slimline2's, but I do modify them to allow me to ride 58's rockered up, and I find that since the groove is so large, there isn't a ton of life in them, grinding-wise, before I start hitting the wheels.  Unfortunately Kaltiks aren't super-durable either, so with either option I would go light on the ledge skating.  You can also check out Valo stock frames, Creates, or GC F1's, for a more traditional feel (smaller split, smaller groove), but these will take more skill to ride flat successfully.  If you think you'll be doing way more cruising than grinding, maybe consider a powerblade frame setup, like the GC Bigs, Kizer Level 2/3, or Bakes. These will allow for a bit of (very careful) groove tricks, but will be much faster for cruising than a traditional flat setup."

I don't really know how sizing for large feet go, I'm a sz 8-9, but I definitely have some wide ones (vans also fitme perfect). Remz are nice for wide feet but they can be terrible beginner skates since they allow you to develop bad habits. I tried the usd carbon frees and they seem to fit ok, but not as wide as remz. Razors are great to start on imo and most of my bigger footed homies seemed to enjoy them. You also might be able to fit into valo jj lights"

rollerblading,308140,ChrisCramer,4,Wed Mar 25 05:18:08 2015 UTC,"Really it doesn't translate much at all.  No recreational skating will prepare you for the transitions of ramps, landing wonky on said transitions, or grinding.  You'll feel comfortable skating fast, but uncomfortable skating fast at an obstacle.  Not to worry though!!  Everything has a learning curve and you'll get great with time and practice.  Just be prepared to take some spills - they'll be rough at the beginning but you'll very quickly learn how to fail gracefully."

rollerblading,308140,seveenti9,3,Wed Mar 25 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"It sounds like OP is just talking about the rolling though. Of course they are not going to feel comfortable doing ramps unless if they had already been doing them on the rec blades. I would assume someone would ask the same about transferring from quads to inline because the rolling itself would be completely different. Maybe OP assumes that the skates would skate different because rec skates are more low cut, bigger wheels and a whole different feel compared to more ankle support and smaller wheels with aggressives."
rollerblading,307mwh,saypataca,3,Wed Mar 25 02:58:36 2015 UTC,"While they will be faster and more stable (probably harder to accelerate by a good amount, ask /u/dickheadjustin), sounds like your problem with suddenly eating shit has more to do with your form.

rollerblading,306uip,chowaniec,2,Tue Mar 24 23:15:02 2015 UTC,Bearing spacers are more axle dependent that they are wheel. Make sure that the bearings are fully seated into the wheel. It sounds like to me that a wheel is binding either in the frame (axels over tightened) or the spacer in the wheels has room to turn and is causing the wheel to bind. The last option would be your wheels are to big for your frame. What skates/frames/wheels are you using.

rollerblading,306uip,super-fish-eel,2,Thu Mar 26 23:04:07 2015 UTC,Hi-Lo usually refers to flat rocker with two different size wheels. Or in hockey it refers to larger wheels in the back and smaller wheels in the front. I'm guessing this could be causing your issue since you have all the same size wheels. What do you have your frame spacers set to? My recommendation would be set all your frames spacers in to the down position and see if that fixes your problem.

That's what I do, and I wear a sz10 in almost all shoes, occasionally a 9.5 if they run really big. Sz10 wraps usually fit me well, and the S skeleton is a nice snug like-a-glove fit for me."
rollerblading,3043x3,aldolega,2,Tue Mar 24 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"Dang, I was thinking about that but decided against it since I didn't know specifics about size ranges with the new souls.  I'll have to keep it in mind for replacements."

rollerblading,300qbx,hifire,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:52:22 2015 UTC,"On the bottom of the souls, you have those two pins the frame slips on to. Not the screws that hold it in, but the part that keeps it from sliding out of the groove forward or backwards. They must be shaved down to 2mm's or less to allow the frame to sit flush in the track before you screw them down. If they are not the correct height, you will end up like the photo above with extensive stresses put on the screws and plastic that is held down by them. They can and will fail due to this issue. If they are shaved off (ie, Remz), they will be over tightened and crack down the pour line. There are a number of videos around on getting them working on your skates, you just to do a little work first."

rollerblading,302n3p,Largesaurus,2,Mon Mar 23 23:45:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry for reposting, but what you're saying about the weight being on the inside of the foot sounds like what people who are unsure on skates often do. Waddling around isn't proper skating form and you should try to get out of that soon.   New skaters often have their legs out diagonally to the ground for stability kind of like negative camber angle(to borrow from automotive terminology) and kind of look like they're waddling on skates. Experienced speed skaters are capable of doing the ""double push"" technique, which is skating with a sort of positive camber angle but you really don't need to try that now. You should however try to get to the point where each time one leg is lifted off the ground, the other leg is as close to straight and perpendicular to the ground as you can make it. It's better skating form, so if you're lifting your right leg in a stride and are temporarily on your left leg, it should more like this |\ rather than this /\ (if you can understand that).  Just keep that in mind, and try your best to skate with your one supporting leg as close to straight as you can during strides, and if you're feeling unbalanced, just remember to get a little lower by bending your knees. This also helps keep your wheel wear even, but you don't need to worry too much about that now.  You can practice this without skates by just assuming the hunched skating position and then lifting one leg out to the side as you stand on the other leg with your knee bent as if you are taking a skating stride sort of like this again>> |\ . Keep holding that position for a while trying not to fall over, then take a step forward and stand on the other leg and repeat, doing a couple lengths of this exercise can help. If you improve your balance at that, you can practice on skates until you can glide thirty feet on one skate at will.   I'd say that your weight shouldn't be too heavily placed on any one part and should be centred, but a lot of control does come from the balls of the foot."
rollerblading,302n3p,Largesaurus,2,Tue Mar 24 00:08:25 2015 UTC,I did read this piece while looking through archives. I guess it's just harder to tell when you're new and are thinking about moving and balancing instead of form. I think this is probably it.
rollerblading,302n3p,Knightmare982,2,Tue Mar 24 00:22:09 2015 UTC,Well if you're still at that point then just go there and get comfortable skating (even with bad form) until you naturally adopt better technique.
rollerblading,302n3p,randiculous,2,Tue Mar 24 00:28:37 2015 UTC,"i find that taking time unlace your skates (i unlace 3 eyelets and just loosen the next two below) and easily sliding in you foot and then lacing them up rather tight.  your skates are new and need to broken in, like new shoes but over a longer period of time.  your wheels are also quite new and make a shallow ""v"" with the ground, after about 3 or so rolls they will look as if one side is shaved more than the other and you should rotate the wheels using your skate tool. also wear padding and practice a basic foward stride, once you get comfterble i would suggest you get a large stick (a hockey stick is great but any long object with a little bit of weight will work) and use that to ""steer"" yourself while you get used to turning. sorry for the bad spelling and grammer im on a mobile device and dont have the time to english."
rollerblading,302n3p,jokingrotten,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do think I need to break them in more.

Given what Largesaurus said I definitely will have uneven wheels."
rollerblading,3011dl,gu1d3b0t,7,Mon Mar 23 16:52:30 2015 UTC,yep. the 2.0 with the mid shoe.. the padding pushes directly into the shoe giving you a terribly sharp pain in your ankle. the thumb screws are too short for the receptor. the front pad falls apart from rubbing on the sharp plastic shell. the toe straps are too long and hang over the side of the boot... yeah prob the worst skate experience I've had so far...  want a fix? get different skates
rollerblading,3011dl,Warkid1993,2,Mon Mar 23 17:52:07 2015 UTC,or replace the hardware with better stuff... like longer screws for the ankle pad and perhaps cut the toe straps

rollerblading,3011dl,chowaniec,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:14:47 2015 UTC,good point. I really like the feel of xsjados though so I don't mind changing a million things on it to make it proper... even then I admit that parts and pieces of the skate like to fly off every now and then.
rollerblading,3011dl,chowaniec,3,Mon Mar 23 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've had these problems too. As well as a broken strap. Which ankle pad screw are you referring to?  As much as I love the 2.0, the cuff hinge turns the ankle pad into a mechanical linkage that shifts down as you flex your ankle. At first I hated it; I don't really notice it anymore, but it's a weird nagging thing that almost seems like a mistake."
rollerblading,3011dl,Stickeesox,3,Mon Mar 23 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"The one on the non-ratchet side. Connecting the plastic strap from the outside of the skate to the ankle pad.  I've been having some success with the flex shifting. What I did was I took the ankle pad off the skate, and bent it across the instep. Held it that way for awhile, and every chance I get I do this. It basically speeds up the breaking in process and it doesn't hurt to flex as much."
rollerblading,3011dl,Warkid1993,3,Mon Mar 23 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, had the same one fall off on me after a 5ish-mile skate. They need to use better threadlocker. Or nylon like you're supposed to."
rollerblading,3011dl,aldolega,3,Mon Mar 23 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"I've had 4 thumb screw go out on me over my brief time with them, i just got replacement screws from a hardware store.    Currently, my velcro straps are dead and I tie them rather then velcro them. The ankle portion of the boots where they connect to the foot-sole-thing cracked about 2 months into having them.    Still I like them, so I'll make the necessary fixes and changes, but I'm definitely looking at other skates down the line."
rollerblading,3011dl,Warkid1993,2,Mon Mar 23 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"doops and xsjados are pretty customizeable. you can change the velcro to buckle/ratchet system without much modification (just take out screws, take out velcro, put in matching buckles, put in screws). People often recommend razor buckles. note: the xsjado 2.0 cuffs are the easy ones to modify/remove the velcro)"

rollerblading,2zyoq0,Largesaurus,7,Mon Mar 23 02:13:45 2015 UTC,"There is no real good reason rollerblading died off, because it plainly shouldn't have. There is larger problem at the bottom of this, and it is the impressionability of young children, especially in the caustic judgmental culture of the teenage West/United States during the nineties and early two-thousands.  I don't think people want to hear me preach, but I've said this before in this very sub and there are still people -especially rollerbladers- out there who need to hear this(slightly edited);   Okay, you're entitled to your own opinion, but saying it makes the sport look ""gay"" just shows that you're just as immature and impressionable as all those skateboarders who mindlessly spew hate for inline skaters.  Every time I hear people call rollerblading gay I honestly just laugh because all it means is that the person saying it thinks that being called ""gay"" is enough to make someone else just quit what they're doing, even if it's a sport they enjoy more than anything else in the world. Do you know what that means? It means that if this childish ""insult"" holds so much power in their own minds, that receiving the same tired gay jokes would be enough to make the haters themselves quit being themselves, and sadly even quit their favourite sport altogether.  And so whenever I hear people sincerely attempt to berate anyone else by saying they ""look gay,"" I feel pity that these people would themselves be so easily swayed by a phrase any four-year-old could recite. (because if you don't believe being called a faggot is enough of a reason to stop what you're doing, why would you bother to try and make people stop what they're doing by saying it to them?)  Just goes to show that a shamefully large amount of people never grow out of their scared impressionable teenage years. Now I don't harbor any personal hatred towards skateboarders, but it's common knowledge that skateboarding is universally known to be the cool kids' sport. This means that a large number, possibly even a large majority, of people who decide they want to learn to skateboard do it not because they have found some meaningful captivation in the act of skateboarding itself, but they do it because it would make them one of the cool kids.  Now there's nothing wrong with that in itself, everybody understands the desire to be cool, but what makes skateboarders cool isn't the fact that they're skateboarding, it's the fact that they know that they're cool. It's deeply ingrained into popular culture everywhere, so it's not hard to feel cool when you know that according to pop culture, you should be the dopest punk on the playground.  But what pretty much everyone on the planet doesn't realize is that the reason cool people are perceived to be cool and ""Heterosexual to the Max""™ isn't because of the actions they're doing, it's because the sense of coolness(/swag/whatever the hell you want to call it) is created by the mindset of the cool person him/herself. This is one of the key differences between skateboarders who know the gay joke and rollerbladers who know the gay joke. Skateboarders skateboard because even their own mommy would know that skateboarding is only a cool boys' activity and god forbid, they can't possibly go on in life if some stranger yelled to them, ""lolz, yer a feggit."" Rollerbladers do it for no reason other than they want to, if they think it's a cool thing to do, it's not because the cool kids said so, it's because they believe it themselves, even when they know that there's a huge group of haters who would do as they're told by their culturing, and vehemently deny this idea.  This is exactly how all the ""really cool people"" act. They don't give a shit what others think, they know that they are doing what they want to, and that's cool. Eminem isn't tossing and turning at night because he's terrified that some twelve-year-old kids thought Slim Shady was too gay, he even goes out of his way to make homosexual jokes about himself. People should just do what they want without a second thought for homophobic attacks, because these phrases are only as insulting as you feel them to be.  And the people who find these phrases to be the most hurtful are the ones saying it.  There's nothing wrong with being gay, if anything it should be a distinction to be proud of, because it shows that we're not afraid to be who we are because of what some vulnerable hater says.  tl;dr: It's 2015, man. It's time you learned that everyone who would have responded to the ""gay"" crap is now either a skateboarder, or has grown up with the rest of the world."

rollerblading,2zyoq0,gu1d3b0t,5,Mon Mar 23 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer, however there's alot to take in.  The short version of the story is it was a marketing campaign designed by the skateboaring industry.

rollerblading,2zyoq0,gu1d3b0t,9,Mon Mar 23 02:46:38 2015 UTC,The hardest part about rollerblading is putting up with the same joke for 20 years.
rollerblading,2zyoq0,Largesaurus,4,Mon Mar 23 02:57:35 2015 UTC,"I've never understood what there was to ""put up with"" because receiving the gay ""joke"" is a guaranteed indication of who in your midst is an impressionable man-child. They still care what others think of them, and would change any and all aspect of their lives if it's ""gay"" enough, who's the loser now?  If you want to take it further, you can see it as praise from them because it takes courage to be gay in spite of all the homophobes and they're essentially saying ""you're being brave to do that stupid shit in front of me, I'll never in all my life grow the balls to do what I want."" So each reiteration from them can even be seen as reinforcing your superiority to those people.  I find it genuinely funny because it's so absolutely pathetic that people who are now in their twenties and thirties still feel so much power in calling something ""gay,"" and the setup/punch line combo being regurgitated verbatim time and again should serve as even more of a reminder of how powerless they are.

Where i live, it so few of people who ride ( skate, blade, bmx etc ) that there is no place for animosity.  Though, i must admit of being guilty of having a skateboard. On some days i just need that zen, when i can skate, pick up a skateboard, and ride a bus to rest, then continue skating, without having to switch to shoes.

I haven't tried Xsjados/Doops, partly because I've been lucky enough to be in places where skate spots are all well within skating distance of each other and accessible by skates. I'm thinking of trying them but I don't think skates take long to put on or take off at all, more than twenty seconds is rare.

rollerblading,2zxgkc,Vexore,2,Sun Mar 22 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"generally, the kind of setup you want for tricks is opposite to freestyle/commuter. the fewer and smaller the wheels, the slower you're going to go and the faster they're going to wear down.    Really, the boot doesn't dictate what kind of skating you're stuck doing. Thanks to the universal frame system you can kind of throw on a big wheel setup on your varsity's and commute all you want.    If you don't want to swap out frames for different uses: Powerblading; big wheels, usually flat, on an aggressive boot lets you do all sorts of grinds, you just won't be grinding on any sort of frame groove."
rollerblading,2zxgkc,Stickeesox,2,Sun Mar 22 20:00:13 2015 UTC,"tbh I'm still not very experienced. Do you think I should just get featherlite 3 with anti-rockers and learn how to grind then make it a flat setup when I want speed? Or Should I just jump the gun and get Ground Control BIG, and learn from them getting both speed and a groove to grind with. There is a big price difference in between them too (lol)."
rollerblading,2zxgkc,aldolega,2,Sun Mar 22 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"Either way, it's great you're getting rid of those K2 stock frames- they're awful. The boots are great though, so long as they fit your feet and are still in good shape  The BIGs or Level2/3s can work well as a do-it-all for someone who already has learned grinding, but they are going to be really tough to learn grinding with.  The best answer for skating distances/cruising AND learning grinding from scratch, unfortunately for your wallet, is going to be two separate frame setups- an antirocker setup, and a powerblade/freeskate setup."

The royale on the curved drop rail was dope, as was a few others, but the zero fish looked so forced, the bump to soul was super weak.

rollerblading,2zmriq,AcidicSpoon,3,Thu Mar 19 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can put a pair of Kizer Advanced Frames on your Rollerblade New Jack 3's. You can buy the frames, wheels, and bearings separately or as a complete set.  A PB frame kit from Roller Warehouse will cost you $114, or $99 depending on your choice of bearings/wheel specs."
rollerblading,2zmriq,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu Mar 19 23:06:53 2015 UTC,"Oh wow thanks man, I really appreciate the help. I'm not too knowledgeable on this subject so thanks again"
rollerblading,2zmriq,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu Mar 19 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"No problem, hope you enjoy your new set up!"
rollerblading,2zmriq,hedropsoap,2,Thu Mar 19 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"hi, I have a pair of razor cult street, can I also use these kizer frames? after buying the aggressive frames and realizing its not what I want, I looked at some Rollerblade skates to go fast, but this seems like acheaper alternative"
rollerblading,2zmriq,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Mar 20 06:02:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can put a pair of Kizer Advance Powerblading frames on the Razors Cult Street. Aggressive skates are made UFS (universal frame system) compliant. Meaning any UFS frame can be put on any UFS skate.  If you're looking to use your razors boot for transportation and not for grinding, you could also consider buying these Rollerblade UFS 84mm Frames which would allow you to use wheels up to 84mm max. Where as the Kizer Advance frames can only house up to 80mm wheels.  If you want to grind, you could just swap out the Rollerblade metal frames for your aggressive frames. Many people own multiple frame set ups to switch between depending on the type of skating they'll be doing at any given time."
rollerblading,2zmriq,DreDizzleMofo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:06:23 2015 UTC,"Try to get 84mm if you only want to get around, not a massive difference from 80mm, but noticeable."
rollerblading,2zlsw4,hebhey,3,Thu Mar 19 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"Traditional aggressive wheels are not ideal for skating from point A to point B but you can get a powerblading set up which allows you to combine a frame meant for grinding, with larger wheels for going fast and skating around town.   Here's an example of a powerblading set up which may suit your needs.  Or these Kizer level III frames. Slap either frame onto an aggressive boot and I think you'd be happy."
rollerblading,2zlsw4,PROFESSIONAL_FART,3,Thu Mar 19 17:42:35 2015 UTC,Thanks man! This might be exactly what ive been looking for. Do you have any reccomendations for some aggressive boots thats good for beginners?
rollerblading,2zlsw4,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu Mar 19 18:30:39 2015 UTC,I recommend the Razors Cult. They're an excellent skate for beginners and advanced skaters alike and are one of the best values on the market. I've actually been buying that style boot pretty much exclusively since 2001.
rollerblading,2zlsw4,jkolada,3,Fri Mar 20 08:21:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the smaller wheel makes using them as transport tricky, not to say people don't still do it. A good transition may be a Powerblading setup like /u/PROFESSIONAL_FART mentioned. The powerblading frames are built to take more of an impact than your speed frames are, and then if you really get into the grinding aspect, you can pick up some trick frames and wheels to play with.  There have been times when I use my powerblading setup to get to the park and warm up, and then I put on my aggressive boots for the good stuff."
rollerblading,2zlsw4,Squaremup,3,Thu Mar 19 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"Ill try it out, that kind of setup looks pretty perfect for my needs :) Thanks!"
rollerblading,2zlsw4,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu Mar 19 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"Btw, do you know about any good aggressive boots for beginners?"
rollerblading,2zlsw4,Squaremup,-1,Thu Mar 19 18:32:13 2015 UTC,"go on www.rollernews.com and watch lots of videos, you'll soon get an idea of what you need. I agree that they're not great for getting from a to b and if that's what you do a lot the wheels wont last too long"
rollerblading,2zkal7,youkai1,2,Thu Mar 19 07:25:38 2015 UTC,Nice video. I liked that after every grind a new skateboarder sat on the ledge. It really took me back to the height of the tony hawk pro skater craze.  Here's a Facebook group for the Colorado Thursday Night Roll. You should be able to get in touch with plenty of bladers in Colorado that way.
rollerblading,2zkal7,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Thu Mar 19 09:21:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, watching the video myself was a blast from the past on the same subject - just reminiscing about how that long ledge ALWAYS doubled as a bench for the skateboarders just doing flat-land stuff.  But it seems like participation is down for them these days as well - so hopefully not such a big deal any more.  Thanks for the link! I was just looking for something of that sort."

rollerblading,2zix6l,icechips,3,Wed Mar 18 23:15:04 2015 UTC,The usual hockey skate setup I see is rockered (slightly smaller wheels on the front and back.  From what I gather that feels the most like hockey skates.  There will be an adjustment period for you and it's definitely a different feel.  I'm sure you'll pick it up super quickly though.
rollerblading,2zix6l,hifire,3,Wed Mar 18 23:38:06 2015 UTC,thanks for the tip man! im super excited to get skating
rollerblading,2zix6l,DannickFox,2,Thu Mar 19 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"It would depend. I think the feeling is similar, I use that setup since my frames are rockered though it's all up to what you're going to do. Rockering is awesome for anything that requires sharp turns and quick movement (like freestyle and speed slalom) although for skating long distances or anything that requires speed for those distances it'd be better for a flat setup. I've also seen hockey skates with the hi-lo setup though I can't remember how that one is like."

rollerblading,2zenkt,PROFESSIONAL_FART,3,Wed Mar 18 02:37:11 2015 UTC,One off the best skates you could buy. I'm probably about to order a set.
rollerblading,2zenkt,FreshMintStart,2,Wed Mar 18 05:31:58 2015 UTC,Do it. Join the cult.
rollerblading,2zenkt,PROFESSIONAL_FART,3,Wed Mar 18 15:41:02 2015 UTC,I've been skating them for years and years. They're a great skate. If you have any specific questions or info you're looking for just let me know.
rollerblading,2zenkt,FreshMintStart,2,Wed Mar 18 14:35:11 2015 UTC,"Hi Mr. Fart I wear size 11 shoes and my rec skates are size 11 however out of desperation I ordered size 10.5. They won't be here for a while but my question is do you think breaking them in will help? I've tried on size 10-11 SL and they were tight but comfy. Also, I keep hearing they're great for beginners but I'm not sure if they meant my level beginner. I just started skating again and relearning how to ride, stop, simple stuff. However once I tried on some agro skates I fell in love. I wouldn't even want to get use to the 8 wheel rec if I plan on riding 4 wheel blues once they get here. Also what do you recommend I switch out on the stock skates once I master them?(:  and by master I mean get a bit better lol"
rollerblading,2zenkt,PROFESSIONAL_FART,3,Wed Mar 18 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Well the Razors Cult skates come in double size ranges. Meaning the 10 you ordered is the same plastic shell you'd get if you ordered a size 10 or 11 skate. The actual difference is all in the liners. So you might just end up needing to get a bigger liner if yours are still too tight after trying to break them in.  These will be fine for relearning the basics since your ultimate goal is to get into aggressive skating, an anti-rocker set up is something you'll want to get used to sooner or later, and doing it from day one might slow you down and feel a little awkward in the short term, but it'll probably save you some time and loss of progress down the line.  Apart from swapping out the liners if they don't fit correctly, the insoles on the cult liners are pretty thin. If you're having any comfort issues after the break-in period you might want to replace the footbeds with a decent athletic insole. It doesn't need to be anything designed for inline skates, I use Dr. Scholls and that takes care of any arch support problems I've had in the past.   I recommend replacing the wheels also. You might as well use the Razors stock wheels first, but just be aware that they're not very good, so you'll need to replace them with something higher quality like Eulogy Wheels or Undercover when they wear out."
rollerblading,2zenkt,FreshMintStart,2,Wed Mar 18 15:17:25 2015 UTC,I've always had problem with flat shoes since I have a high arch on my foot. Or so my mom tells me every time I tried to buy converse. When I did finally get around to buying them I regretted it instantly. Can you explain about Dr. Scholls and all that is foot problems? I know that less wheel and shorter mean more stress on my feet and ankles so I'm mentally prepare for that.
rollerblading,2zenkt,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Wed Mar 18 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not a doctor, so I can't comment on foot issues specifically that's something to talk with your doctor about but based on my own experience rollerblading I find that Dr. Scholls insoles just give me some extra cushioning and an overall more comfortable skate. Particularly with the Cult line.  Here's their website.  I'm not sure what country you live in but here in the US Dr. Scholls are available at most every shoe store as well as retail stores like wal-mart, target, etc."
rollerblading,2zenkt,that_tech_guy,2,Wed Mar 18 15:34:38 2015 UTC,Got it thanks! Also I live in Chicago and the streets are eh.. At least where I live. How do those skates do on the street? The skate park isn't far but I'd like to practice in front of my house first.

rollerblading,2zaq05,eck226,3,Tue Mar 17 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"Too far away to make it, but we had a discussion like this when we were building our first park.  The thing that our council realized was that kids will play.  Inline, board or bike, they will jump, grab and grind.     The reason the city should do this is if they rebuild their park, they focus where this is done.  Kids will gather there for these activities in a place designed for them to be done.  If they don't update the park, they will find another place to have fun.    So council will be able to save $500k, but they'll easily spend double that fixing and then securing the areas kids will go if this facility isn't available.  On a long timeline, all residents of your city will benefit from spending these funds as allocated on updating this park."
rollerblading,2zbkj1,ryan924,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"It makes the skate more maneuverable than if they were all the upper wheel size, less maneuverable than if they were all the lower size. It does, but you can use this as incentive to skate better. Usually. Sometimes you can get a pack specifically for this kind of setup (hi-low)."
rollerblading,2za4te,Swandive_,3,Mon Mar 16 21:58:36 2015 UTC,"Changing wheels is indeed easy. You can buy different wheels and swap them out.  Usually, the skate comes with the maximum possible wheel size on them. If they don't, you probably shouldn't buy from that company.  To be honest, that's not the skate I'd recommend if you're looking for 80mm wheels. The large gaps between each wheel simply make the skate less maneuverable and serve no benefit. But if they are the only once you have access to, i suppose they are better than nothing."
rollerblading,2za4te,jokingrotten,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:18:01 2015 UTC,But it should be no problem to just swap them for bigger ones? Like 84mm?

rollerblading,2z36v5,zoocy,4,Sun Mar 15 03:19:20 2015 UTC,First thing I do with my skates these days is swap the laces out for some hockey laces. I can't deal with low quality laces that get loosen up while I'm skating and rip.
rollerblading,2z36v5,gypsyblader,3,Sun Mar 15 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"I've been researching into recreational/urban skates this is just my understanding. I'm just a beginner myself so I'm sure there are guys on this sub that could answer your question better than me.  Which company is the best for recreational use?  If it's comfort and fitness you might like K2 I was close the getting a pair of F.I.T 84 Boa's. But, I want my skate to take more of a beating and be more responsive. So I'm how looking at Seba either FRX, FR1, Highs or High Lights. I'd be interested in the Rollerblade Twisters as well but my local store doesn't seem to stock them.   What difference does wheel size make?  Large are typically for fitness/speed skating they require more balance and are less manoeuvrable i.e. harder to do hockey stops and sharp turns.   In addition to the size you might want to look into how hard the wheels are.  Should I mess around with the laces when I get them?  Don't know  And also please tell me anything else you might think I should know.  Bearing ratings the higher the number the better ILQ, SG and ABEC also the numbering system is ruffly equivalent ILQ9 = SG9 = ABEC9.  Also have a look into the material of the frame   I found this video helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VV3YNq6qo0"

rollerblading,2z36v5,Largesaurus,3,Sun Mar 15 20:12:26 2015 UTC,I'm no expert on aggressive skates but in general they have smaller flatter wheels often the two inner wheels are smaller and harder again. They also have modifications to the boot and frame that make it easier to do grinding tricks lastly they're built like tanks as they need to be very strong.   From my research aggressive skates are not as good just skating around and transportation. For me I've just decided to go with a Urban/Recreational skate as I just want it for fitness and fun I might to some jumps and go down stairs but nothing too serious.
rollerblading,2z125t,photonnymous,3,Sat Mar 14 16:08:58 2015 UTC,I got enthralled by this video when i just came to this /r/ to ask a question. Good show man.

rollerblading,2z125t,bladedvox,2,Sat Mar 14 19:42:03 2015 UTC,"These are different. Made for speed, lubricated differently, removable shields, more third-grade humor, etc."
rollerblading,2z125t,provokerolling,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:12:05 2015 UTC,Ah. I had good experiences with Armored until (after many more than the 3 advertised sessions lol) they sounded like thunder and siezed up. Definitely appreciate the removable shields. I'd be psyched to try these on my urban setup.
rollerblading,2z125t,bladedvox,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:06:05 2015 UTC,It was weird. Some couldn't be destroyed and others were crappy. I think the removable shields will be a plus. Try them out. If you don't like them let me know.

rollerblading,2yyqt5,IConveyI,4,Fri Mar 13 23:21:46 2015 UTC,I've just gone through this exact decision. I ended up going with the frees over the carbons though. They should arrive in a few days so I'll let you know how they feel wit GC bigs and 72s on them.   The sebas look brilliant but we're way to expensive down here is Australia

rollerblading,2yyqt5,chowaniec,4,Fri Mar 20 06:36:47 2015 UTC,something with a higher cuff will be better
rollerblading,2ywrj8,Errecting_Nope,5,Fri Mar 13 13:56:00 2015 UTC,You are going to fall a lot at first. That said I wouldn't sink too much money into things just yet. Get used to just getting out there and don't worry about tearing things up.
rollerblading,2ywrj8,tubz,3,Fri Mar 13 14:26:03 2015 UTC,"Generally what's the cheapest gear I could get, but not too cheap that it'll fail me?"
rollerblading,2ywrj8,unseemlycad,5,Fri Mar 13 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"Hey dude. Sounds like you'd want aggressive skates and where they are concerned I would recommend trying some skates on if possible. Name brands tend to be best but you get affordable stuff. There are basically three main factors in choice of setup. Boot, frame and wheel setup.  There are essentially two types of boot. Soft & hard boots. Soft tend to be comfy and good for flexibility with downsides that they tend to lack in support and can get floppy with wear. Hard boots are good for support and power transfer when you push or pump but can lack comfort with the stock liners. Some are made from carbon and some from modern plastics with carbon the stiffest and arguably least comfy. But like I said. Probably try some if you can.  There are loads of types of frame. Put way too simply, some are good for grinding, some for speed.  There are three common wheel setups. Anti rocker, for grind based vocab, with two smaller harder wheels in the middle which help to roll along and off things. Freestyle, with no middle wheels which are very grind focused and catch rolling on stuff without control. And flat. All four wheels the same size. Good for speed, cornering and stability but can catch up grinding.   Personally I am a fan of the M12 boot, which is the Valo shape. You can get some old stock Valo's new and pretty cheap these days and are a great skate to get started on, although I would probably recommend a flat setup for starters what with the mention of parkor.   Good luck fellow roller fool."
rollerblading,2ywrj8,haisojoko,3,Fri Mar 13 20:22:51 2015 UTC,What kind of skating are you going for?
rollerblading,2ywrj8,haisojoko,2,Fri Mar 13 14:55:36 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure about that.. maybe a little to the extreme? Might do a little parkour if it allows?
rollerblading,2ywrj8,haisojoko,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:47:40 2015 UTC,"So do you want to focus on going fast and doing a few tricks or do you want to focus more on tricks? If you want to go fast and do a few tricks here and there then you probably want a powerblading setup. You get soul plates to grind with and big wheels to go fast on. I don't really know of any cheap PB setups though, so that's gonna be a roadblock for ya."
rollerblading,2ywrj8,Warkid1993,3,Fri Mar 13 15:54:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, first of all, welcome to the world of inline skating! You have taken your first step into an underground world of adrenaline and pure awesomeness.   Few questions before I can give you any recommendations for skates: What's your budget? What is your risk factor? Do you know anyone who skates?  Good luck and looking forward to hearing from you!"

rollerblading,2yvr7p,Vandebe,2,Fri Mar 13 09:46:21 2015 UTC,"Basically, soft wheels are for grip and shock absorption, and hard wheels are for speed (and sliding if you're into that). Weight does offset this a little (i.e. harder wheels for heavier people for mostly similar performance). I'm about 20 pounds lighter than you and loving 84a for city cruising. I'd maybe go softer if your city has really shitty sidewalks/roads.  You'll notice that aggressive wheels are usually somewhere between pretty hard and stupid hard. That's because skateparks are usually stupid smooth and skatepark skaters want stupid speeds. Similarly, speed skaters usually skate on very controlled surfaces. These guys usually rock mid-80s and upwards.  Slalom skaters usually use mid to lower 80s because they need a the grip more than they need speed.  Urban skaters sometimes go even lower (like your 78a wheels) for the shock absorption and a little extra grip for dodging pedestrians. Also people who don't need much performance at all, but just want cushy skates."
rollerblading,2yvr7p,HighRelevancy,2,Fri Mar 13 11:53:03 2015 UTC,"Does weight affect it that dramatically?  I'm only just starting, but for the effect on performance, I was thinking about going softer when I replace the wheels the first time.  My skates are 100-90 hi-lo, with 83A, and I weigh around 230.  Would I experience too much wear going any softer, then?"
rollerblading,2yvr7p,Desirsar,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:30:57 2015 UTC,"It does, especially for bigger wheels because there is more torque acting on the core of the wheel. I'm also riding 83a wheels on my urban setup and i'm about half your weight. In my case I could go a little lower on the scale feasibly and still have the wheels last a while, but my sweet spot for big wheels is 85a.  Also +1 on the RB Hydrogens"
rollerblading,2yut9h,Desirsar,4,Fri Mar 13 00:05:53 2015 UTC,"Are there any exercises that specifically help with strength in the foot and ankle?   Skating.  Then some more skating.      I'm decent on ice, great on quads, but I just can't make myself go faster after two days on them, nor make myself cut harder.   You can't cut on rollerblades like you can on ice skates.  Quads give you much better traction to cut with, since you know, you have offset wheels.  Practice your crossovers and you'll get better at them.     Is there anything I can do with the skate that will help with this?   Skate more."
rollerblading,2yut9h,LibAtheist,3,Fri Mar 13 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"""Skate more"" was already in the plan, so I won't change anything.  :)  I may make a point of doing soccer drills again, though, maybe as a warmup."
rollerblading,2yut9h,ultimomono,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:44:38 2015 UTC,"Totally agree that nothing will strengthen your foot and ankle like skating. Just keep at it. It will get more and more fun.  Slalom type skates and wheels have edges that aren't all that different from the sensation of ice skates, but--and it's a big but--it can take  a long time to get the foot/ankle/leg strength and flexibility necessary to control the edge action. I do think practicing in the biggest flat space you can find will really help with speed. Crossovers are key, because they help with balance and skating on one foot."
rollerblading,2yut9h,jitsujay,3,Sat Mar 14 23:24:11 2015 UTC,Glad to see I'm not the only one making a return to skating. I'm 34 and will be getting a new pair in the next couple of weeks.

rollerblading,2yk55e,greenstainedbrain,9,Tue Mar 10 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"Its certainly an odd thing, as blading is alive and well in Europe and some parts of Asia.

Maybe in Oceania and the US it will make a comeback."
rollerblading,2yk55e,DranDran,7,Tue Mar 10 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"I will never understand the gay stigma behind blading   I think there are a few different different reasons for it, even if they're dumb. Rollersports have always had associated dance cultures (rollerdisco, etc.), which is increasingly ""not OK"" for straight males to do. Blading involves lots of gesture (AKA dance; watch a Broskow section and study his landings) and also has a certain similarity to figure skating, which is stereotypically a ""gay thing."" Throw in some tight, revealing spandex (common amongst early recreational bladers), and you've got a recipe for homophobia. American culture especially is way more homophobic than European culture.  The exception is roller hockey, where you have pads to make you look extra muscular and you beat each other up. That's an Acceptable Straight Activity."
rollerblading,2yk55e,chowaniec,5,Wed Mar 11 01:58:21 2015 UTC,"I've always thought it was just skateboarders insecurities tbh, we got a bit of flak when we started hitting the skateparks as kids but most arguments would be stopped by showing skateboarders that we could go way harder/higher/faster than they could.    We completely owned the 14ft halfpipe at the big park which was great as no skateboarders had the balls to drop into it."
rollerblading,2yk55e,hifire,3,Wed Mar 11 03:26:11 2015 UTC,Hahaha the best part for me is when I beat them in a game of S.K.A.T.E. (on skateboard). That's the best way to shut them little mouths. I skateboarded for almost 10 years but still prefer blading... Much funnier to make tricks with your body than flipping a piece of wood IMO

rollerblading,2yk55e,hifire,3,Thu Mar 12 21:46:54 2015 UTC,^  This... There are so many associated activities to blading.

rollerblading,2yk55e,DranDran,5,Thu Mar 12 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's definitely an interesting topic for conversation. I started blading as a teenager in 1999 and grew up in a part of London where nobody rollerbladed and even skateboarders got shit for skateboarding. You already had to watch yourself without blades never mind with them. There was definitely a stigma attached to blading but i think that is dying out.  You have to remember that the 90's were pretty loud with the luminous colours and what not and rollerblades were new. Skateboarders were threatened by the new kid and we were taking over their parks and skate spots.  before i go on, has anyone else got any views on the subject?"

You most likely have really hard wheels and you will be more prone to slip on harder surfaces. If you are only using them for work I would suggest getting some gel wheels, or any wheels under 89A.  In my experience, any wheels under 89A I find to grip more at skateparks (polished concrete or wood).   Goodluck, don't be afraid to post back if you have any issues with the hardwear while trying to change the wheels (pictures can help).  Edit: What the hell is Sonic?

rollerblading,2ygf9r,PatSayJack,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:11:26 2015 UTC,Is that a powerblade frame?  How did you get the wheels to fit?
rollerblading,2ygf9r,Vandebe,2,Mon Mar 9 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"That's the kizer slimline. First ones, you can easily wheel well your souls and rocker these up, but these would very easily fit rockered down."

rollerblading,2ygf9r,Vandebe,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:49:24 2015 UTC,Could. You will need to dremel se wheel wells and a bit out of the UFS mounts of your frames
rollerblading,2ygf9r,Vandebe,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:51:31 2015 UTC,"These look rockered up, you can't see much of the core of the wheel"

rollerblading,2ydu4z,hifire,2,Sun Mar 8 23:19:16 2015 UTC,Personally I feel carbon frees are too flexy for big wheels.
rollerblading,2ydu4z,Vandebe,1 point,Mon Mar 9 01:06:50 2015 UTC,Have you ridden Remz by any chance?  Any experience with the carbons?  My big worry is they will be so stiff top souls might be tough.
rollerblading,2ydu4z,DaNetNaverna,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:11:33 2015 UTC,I roll in the red ledoux's carbons. Top tricks aren't harder to do. It feels like you have more control of your foot.

rollerblading,2ydu4z,restolawlz,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:51:04 2015 UTC,Definitely. I have a handful of friends who skate them and they've all mentioned the flex.
rollerblading,2ydu4z,restolawlz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:53:46 2015 UTC,Tony rivituso smashes in the nils and ground control bigs. He's a vegas local who swears by it. As far as carbons I'd go with the diys for better foot control and flex. Carbon frees are to big in the toe box and were to loose for me. While carbons are perfect and heat moldable.
rollerblading,2ydu4z,restolawlz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 12:49:34 2015 UTC,The DIY's are definitely an option at the moment.  They are substantially cheaper than the 3's and Eislers too.

rollerblading,2ycv2f,polskimoose,3,Mon Mar 9 00:46:49 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, check that out.   Do you know anything about the TV 3 vs. the Genesys? I'd say I'm most stuck between those two after pointing that out."
rollerblading,2ycv2f,polskimoose,4,Mon Mar 9 00:58:01 2015 UTC,I absolutely love Valos.  I have never skated razors but people like them.  Valo seems to be doing more for blading as a brand - Jon Julio (owner) is the man and puts on the blading cup every year.  The last couple Valo films have been incredible too.  Can't really compare the skates myself but I can say I love Valos and in my opinion they look way cooler!
rollerblading,2ycv2f,chowaniec,2,Mon Mar 9 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"I've never skated the TV3s, but I had Gens for a little while. The biggest difference between the two is the width; Valos run narrow, whereas Gens are one of the widest boots. If you're going for not-ugly, get the TVs. Gens are totally skateable boots, but they look pretty wack and dated IMO."
rollerblading,2ycv2f,chowaniec,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:06:53 2015 UTC,"I was thinking along the same lines actually, the only thing that caught me off guard was how new the gens were compared to the TVs. I think the TVs are like 2013 and the Gens are a 2015 version. Feel like newer might be better in this situation, but then again I don't know shit.   Also, I was hoping somewhere would have the black tv3s in stock for size 13 but those appear to not exist haha"
rollerblading,2ycv2f,polskimoose,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:13:01 2015 UTC,"the TVs are like 2013 and the Gens are a 2015 version   Eh, the ugly truth is that everyone's been making the same skates for 10-20 years.

rollerblading,2ycv2f,Vandebe,3,Wed Mar 11 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah its not an issue anti rockers simply give you more space for locking grinds. IMHO it also makes your ride a little more stiff, and makes turning quickly a little more difficult. As long as you have a hblock to actually gring with your fine. As far as anti rocker setups go, you can buy frames which will only need four wheels anyway like the featherlite 2s."
rollerblading,2ycv2f,chowaniec,2,Sun Mar 8 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"anti rockers simply give you more space for locking grinds   They also slide when they touch the ledge, haha. I skated flat when I first started off and switching out my middle wheels was a revelation in terms of making grinds easier. I want to go back to flat, ironically, but anti is great for beginners."
rollerblading,2ycv2f,Warkid1993,2,Mon Mar 9 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"Both the Razors have GC Featherlite 3 frames that fit 60 mm both outside and inside (so yes, you can swap to a flat setup).  The Valos have ""Valo symmetrical frames"" and I have no idea what that means and I didn't find anything on them.  As a general tip, figure out what the frames are fitted (usually it's mentioned) and then do a quick google, stand alone frames at skateshops will state what kind of wheel sizes they support on inside (middle two) and outside (back and front)."

They're built for hockey so yes. I beat the living shit out of a pair of skates for 2 years and they worked perfect until a frame snapped. They were hardy skates They will be fine for rec skating, however, the wheels are VERY soft for grip. If you skate them outside, be prepared to chew through wheels very fast. They are expensive to replace, too. A solution to that is to buy outdoor hockey wheels for them which will last longer."

If you have a dremel, some sandpaper,  or a wood chisel,  just shave off a tiny sliver from the bottom of your souls where its catching. It wont affect the integrity of the frame at all and should fit nicely after that"
rollerblading,2y7h9u,thegigglepuss,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:19:54 2015 UTC,That's what I will have to do. I'm just so surprised that Kaltik released the frame with this type of problem. It's not UFS.
rollerblading,2y7h9u,thegigglepuss,3,Sat Mar 7 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"It's ufs,  it's just that different boots have like a 1/16in discrepancy in the frame space. I've seen them go in flawless on valo and usd,  and then not fit in some razors and remz. I think it's just because it's a standalone company that's not partners with a distribution company for any boots"
rollerblading,2y7h9u,aldolega,3,Sat Mar 7 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"Kaltiks are UFS compatible, it's just that the UFS standard isn't as complete as it should be- it doesn't specify a maximum depth for the frame channel.  I wouldn't shave down the soul/baseplate. Those parts are pretty thin on the SL, and bear a lot of structural load. I would shave down the sides of the frames until they fit in the channel and sit flat. Basically just extend the existing reliefs molded in the frame."

rollerblading,2y5jus,Vandebe,2,Sat Mar 7 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"If you are literally learning grinding for the first time, skating those Arrow frames would be doing yourself a huge disservice, and setting your progression back by years. Learning grinds from scratch, on those frames, without getting really hurt and/or so frustrated that you give up, is HIGHLY unlikely.  Get an anti setup, learn stalls and then the basic grinds (frontside, backside, soul, mizou, acid, pornstar, royale, farv) and get comfortable/proficient with them on a variety of obstacles. This will probably take you a year at least. By then you'll be starting to mess with more advanced stuff like topsides, unity/savannah stuff, one-footed grinds, spins into grinds, etc, and you'll probably be proficient enough to start messing with a flat aggressive setup. Once you have that down, THEN you can start tackling grinding in grooveless powerblade frames.  Realize that I'm not telling you to put the Arrows in a drawer and forget about them for years. You can (and should) be doing a whole bunch of stuff on skates that doesn't involve grinding and benefits from a big-wheel setup, which they'll be perfect for."

rollerblading,2y6hl2,Travis_Stewart,6,Sat Mar 7 03:05:18 2015 UTC,I've noticed a load of females on Instagram absolutely killing it. They use the tag 'bladies'.
rollerblading,2y6hl2,MN_MilkPlus,3,Fri Mar 6 22:49:25 2015 UTC,I also think there are quite a few girls lurking in this very sub...
rollerblading,2y6hl2,Travis_Stewart,4,Fri Mar 6 23:04:17 2015 UTC,Hopefully! Sexism has no place in skating!
rollerblading,2y6hl2,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Fri Mar 6 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"Even the concept of it is sad. If you rip, you rip."
rollerblading,2y6hl2,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Sat Mar 7 01:53:44 2015 UTC,I feel like the fear of being looked down upon when failing is all in the skaters head. A skate park is usually pretty cool to its skaters. And I cant imagine the idea of girls skating instills some weird gendered malice.    But maybe my parks have been different.
rollerblading,2y6hl2,KidneyAttic,4,Sat Mar 7 03:19:52 2015 UTC,What would you guys think of having a flair or tab for content with girls? Probably would get a lot more interested to join.   Rollerblading doesn't have nearly as homogenous an image as other skatepark sports do.
rollerblading,2y6hl2,Sonox,5,Fri Mar 6 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's a reverse sexism thing. Like ""don't act racist if you're arguing about discrimination and racism"".   You shouldn't be held on a pedestal because your a girl and you blade. If you rip, you rip. If you go to the park and a dude puts you down and wants to feel better about himself, then they aren't the type of bladers id be caught with. I've skated with countless ""bladies"" before, and most of which would swiftly spank me in a game of skate. And the ones who couldn't? Fuck, I skate with groms more often then people on my level. I'd never talk down on someone and feel better about myself, especially a lady. You've got boots on your feet? IDGAF how good or beginner you are, I'll skate with anyone from a day one Blader to Broskow.   I'll get some heat for this likely, but the thing I'm tired of hearing is how it's a men's sport, or unfair, or whatever. There are 10,000,000 things women do that I never could. I've also grew up skating with Fallon who was always just as good as all the dudes I've ever skated with. Then you have Chynna who just wrecks everything and anything out there. I'm sorry you feel inadequate next to the dudes, or shunned in a dudes world original writer of the article, but the reality is, you couldn't have it more backwards. As stated above, skating with a bladie is like seeing a unicorn. No one forgets that shit. And everyone wants to be there when it happens. This article seems I'll written and very ill informed about blading as a whole. Sorry your local scene blows.   My two cents, by no means sexist, racist, or implying any view but my own here. Also, half asleep."
rollerblading,2y6hl2,aldolega,3,Sat Mar 7 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"100% agree. I've never once seen or heard anyone talk about what OP is talking about, and I've been skating 19 years all over the US and parts of Asia. Whether it's learning or shredding, people respect women who put themselves out there because it's a painful sport."
rollerblading,2y6hl2,corgibuttzgaming,2,Sat Mar 7 02:15:13 2015 UTC,Exactly.
rollerblading,2y6hl2,DimmingLight4,3,Sat Mar 7 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, I see no need to have any sort of flair for bladie content. Original content is original content, doesn't matter to me what's going on in your pants.   I agree though, whoever wrote this doesn't seem to have much knowledge of the rollerblading scene as a whole. I grew up watching Fabiola da Silva whooping dudes on vert. Jenna Downing had a pro boot from razors not too long ago, Chynna is one of the best skaters currently out there. Period. Then you've also got Coco repping for Rollerblade inc (with five other women on the pro team.) Olga Bouwhuis co-owns one of the sickest boot companies out there and Angie Walton was literally the rollerblading taste maker for more than a decade when Daily Bread was still active.  Women have always had a place in rollerblading. More men might partake in the sport, but I don't know anyone who would try to shame a woman for rollerblading and to be honest the kind of person that cares about that sort of thing probably wouldn't rollerblade to begin with.. You know, because it's not cool."
rollerblading,2y6ykj,Vandebe,3,Sat Mar 7 00:24:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty easy to please, I like harder wheels but when push comes to shove as long as the urethane is good I'll skate whatever is available.  I'm much more picky about size though. Under 57mm feels too small for me. I like to stick with 59-60mm.  This is a bit off topic but I imagine a future where we fully make the jump to a 64-72mm wheel range standard. The Big's from GC really sealed the deal, proving you don't have to sacrifice grinds to ride on 72's.  Jumping 10-12mm's on average would open up so many possibilities for rollerblading. I think it's time everyone starts transitioning to big boy wheels."

rollerblading,2y6ykj,chowaniec,2,Mon Mar 9 16:14:22 2015 UTC,88 is even to soft for me. I need an 89 typically. 85 would be a cluster fuck in my opinion. I've got a set of the Fothon wheels that are 82a (72mm) flat rocker I'm wondering how they are gonna hold up.

rollerblading,2y6ykj,bladedvox,2,Sat Mar 7 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"I like hard wheels around 90a, for park & street. Easier to feel like you're going to slip and slide, especially freestyle, but in my experience they hold up better to gaps and whacky terrain, and don't smush into the ground when I spider.  I do however like dual densities because they combine the stable feeling of hard wheels with the easy turning and grip of soft wheels."

rollerblading,2y5pz5,Extrafo,6,Fri Mar 6 18:16:54 2015 UTC,Seba FR1 is more comfortable (wider boot). Twister 80 might give you more control with its narrower fit. Both have decent shock absorption; the Seba FR1 has a removable heel-dampening-system pad under the liner incase you dont want the heel rise and shock absorption.   I think seba fr1 is a better choice for being an all-around skate... very tough and very serviceable. Both are great skates though

His skating is a treat to watch and the commentary isn't bad either, although he has the same problem most bladers do. They aren't used to speaking in a non-conversational context, so he tends to ramble and things aren't always the most coherent.

rollerblading,2xvczv,lolwutdo,5,Wed Mar 4 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"You can get aluminium UFS frames that will fit any aggressive skate. Most commonly available (not that common) are the rollerblade fusion frames in 80mm and 90mm sizes. e.g. http://www.aggressivemall.com/RB-Fusion-UFS-Aluminum-Frame-p/rb-frame-fusion.htm You can also try hunting ebay for old skates and take the frames off. (RB fusion, K2 Il Capo, Salomon FSK)  The disadvantage of UFS compared with non-aggressive standard frames is that you can't adjust the position of the frame.  If you do build your own skates, you will need:  -boots  -frames (should come with axles, bolts and frame spacers if needed)  -wheels (x8)  -bearings (x16)  -8mm floating bearing spacers (often come with bearings but not always)"
rollerblading,2xvczv,raffraff89,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, that frame is pretty much solves my whole issue with using aggressive boots.  I got one more question though, I ordered a pair of K2 80 Inline Skates just to test the waters and see if I like rollerblading; would I be able to salvage the frames and wheels to put on a pair of aggressive skates?"
rollerblading,2xvczv,raffraff89,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"You'll be able to use the wheels (depending on frame size), bearings and probably the spacers. Not the frames though."
rollerblading,2xvczv,chowaniec,3,Thu Mar 5 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"The standard you're looking for is called UFS (Universal Frame System), which all aggressive skates (newer than, say, 2002) and a few rec skates follow. Others have already listed the affordable frame options, but if you've got $400 to spare, there's always the Wizard Frame.  Blades are a bit simpler than bikes. There's UFS vs. non-UFS for frames and 8 mm vs 7 mm bearings; beyond that, most stuff is proprietary and not really interchangeable (without modding; there are a few exceptions like buckles, Remz and Razors cuffs, etc.). Most rec skates aren't really serviceable at all."
rollerblading,2xvczv,hifire,3,Wed Mar 4 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Hehe, it's hard to look at those Eislers and not want a pair.    The biggest wheels I have seen on them are 80mm on the Kizer advance powerblading frames.  Honestly an 80mm wheel is pretty massive when it comes to an aggressive boot.  I do believe the majority (if not all) aggressive skates use the UFS (Universal Frame System) these days but there is no guarantee that you will be able to throw just any frame on them without doing some research.  Also the bolt lengths may vary from company to company so some modification may be required.

rollerblading,2xur0e,lanith,6,Wed Mar 4 01:03:20 2015 UTC,Don't correlate wheel freespin time with actual bearing/wheel performance. I've had wheels freespin for very little time and they rolled real smooth and quiet. Just try skating them and see if they feel sluggish I guess.

rollerblading,2xur0e,franzwithbenefits,5,Wed Mar 4 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"That's probably not normal. Take the wheels out again and check if you really pushed the bearings in there all the way. They have to be down completely or you might experience something like this. Give them a good hard push, maybe wiggle some.  Then reassemble and try again."
rollerblading,2xur0e,myusernamesalwayssuc,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:46:38 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer. They'll spin differently when they have weight on them, so free-spin isn't a good indicator on it's own of what sort of shape your bearings are in"

rollerblading,2xur0e,ReiReim,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:34:53 2015 UTC,What is the function of spacers anyway? Are some wheels/bearings designed to use them and some aren't?
rollerblading,2xur0e,bladedvox,2,Thu Mar 5 02:02:59 2015 UTC,They spread the load evenly across the axle so you don't put too much strain on your bearings. Also if you don't put them in you can over tighten the bolts and add extra friction.   I can't say I've heard of inline bearings that were designed to not take spacers. Not to say they don't exist but bearing/frames come with spacers for a reason
rollerblading,2xur0e,raffraff89,2,Thu Mar 5 09:47:47 2015 UTC,Dont worry. It only matters if they spin when you stand on them.
rollerblading,2xur0e,Sir_not_sir,1 point,Wed Mar 4 08:58:51 2015 UTC,"If they are double-shielded non-serviceable bearings they will have a good amount of friction keeping free-spin time low. This was my experience with Provoke Armored bearings and they actually kicked a lot of ass. You should start worrying when the bearing has irregular resistance (i.e. resists only at a certain range of angles), since this means the races have warped."
rollerblading,2xto1h,haisojoko,3,Tue Mar 3 20:13:44 2015 UTC,I would go through in the following order;   Standard Soul Pornstar Acid Soul Miszou    Check out -> https://www.youtube.com/user/rollingiw for all tutorials  Peace
rollerblading,2xto1h,greenstainedbrain,4,Tue Mar 3 21:26:36 2015 UTC,"why would he learn a meezu last? if not first, it's the second easiest trick. if you're not focused just on soul tricks try a frontside or backside, pick the one you're more comfortable with. then try royal or farf.  also, work on finding your ""safey trick"" and practice it a lot. don't focus on nailing every trick, at a certain point you'll start picking the tricks that fit your style the most."
rollerblading,2xto1h,greenstainedbrain,2,Tue Mar 3 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"yo dude,  I don't think there is a right answer :) Just opinions.  I would have thought Pornstar would be easier because you kinda have more space to miss and not bail (more chance of resting the side of boot on top of what you are grinding as opposed to catching a wheel with the Miszou), just a thought."
rollerblading,2xto1h,greenstainedbrain,3,Tue Mar 3 22:22:11 2015 UTC,yah you're completely right. what feels weird to me is easier for you:)
rollerblading,2xto1h,HighRelevancy,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:26:54 2015 UTC,I'm also a bit scared of wheel bite if I attempt some of these with a flat 80mm setup. Is it possible?
rollerblading,2xto1h,HighRelevancy,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:36:05 2015 UTC,I couldn't say mate. I have never tried to grind with such big wheels. I would only suggest to start of stalling on a curb until you feel comfortable landing the position of the grind before you go for it. There will always be a learning curve with the possibility of landing on your ass :) but you will soon be landing them with ease with a bit of practice.
rollerblading,2xto1h,chowaniec,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"well it's possible but that's not the ideal set up for grinding, especially for someones who's new. but if there's enough wax, anything is possible.."

I mean, you could basically just do makios with your h-block foot in soul/acid/porn/miszou position barely making contact. It's probably better that you buy a more appropriate skate setup so you can actually put your weight where it needs to be and balance properly."
rollerblading,2xs2ks,renerdrat,2,Tue Mar 3 12:10:15 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a hard boot, Something like the Rollerblade Twister/Fusion or Anything by Seba, It's difficult to find a good soft boot, and even the really good ones don't seem to last more than a year or two. The skates i mentioned however are practically indestructible, and i would recommend buying second hand on ebay. I'm usually bored at work so if you give me your size, budget and vague location i'll recommend you something."
rollerblading,2xs2ks,Domsablos,1 point,Tue Mar 3 12:40:15 2015 UTC,"okay... so on closer inspection is a lot harder to get decent second hand skates in the US, i'm in the UK a lot of my friends have nearly new Seba skates for around £30... Brand new FR2's for $150 inc postage looks pretty decent tho."
rollerblading,2xs2ks,Domsablos,2,Tue Mar 3 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"Fila is at best a mediocre brand.  Depending on your needs and budget, Rollerblade Twister, or Fusion is a decent choice for a begginer. I have Twister 80s, and they're virtually indestructible (unless you really abuse them). Regarding your original question - if I had to chose between anything from Fila and K2 I'd always pick K2."

rollerblading,2xqnff,hifire,5,Tue Mar 3 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"No experience with GC Bigs, but they seem to be kickass from what I've seen here on /r/rollerblading.  I have a couple friends who ride Kaltik Stealths. Pretty good but the plastic is a little soft. Occasionally they will have defects but if you mail Kaltik with proof they will replace the frames for you. Another thing to note is the plastic spacers which you will probably want to replace with aluminum.  I have been riding flat on old TRS frames (closest things to these would be Create Originals or Kizer Classic frames), and the low profile makes them very nice for gaps.  Another option to check out would be Kizer Slimlines. Taller than the classic but has a wider groove and can fit 72/80mm (depending on the type of soul plates) on the outside for a different kind of speedy setup."
rollerblading,2xqnff,bladedvox,2,Tue Mar 3 03:02:20 2015 UTC,Cheers for the reply.  I really like the look of the stealths but I have read a few people nothing that the frame drags once you wear you wheels down a little bit.  It seems like a potential pain if I had to buy new wheels all the time when they still have life in them.
rollerblading,2xqnff,myusernamesalwayssuc,2,Tue Mar 3 03:31:04 2015 UTC,"I'm on my second pair of kaltiks and haven't had that problem yet. the wheel wells or whatever they're called wear down as well, so it would probably be time to replace the wheels anyway before they got that small, unless you only skate handrails or like your wheels anti-rocker sized or something. Also, personally I would recommend against slimlines for flat, they feel good for the first session or two, but the groove is way too deep and doesn't do much to shield the wheels, so I started getting wheel bite pretty bad after skating a couple ledges"
rollerblading,2xqnff,bladedvox,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:02:57 2015 UTC,Haven't heard this personally but seems logical. Another one I forgot to mention was Valo/Youth frames. Strangely I've heard more good things about the Team Valo frames than Youth's pro models
rollerblading,2xqnff,Warkid1993,2,Tue Mar 3 04:29:46 2015 UTC,"I have been skating flat since 2006. For normal everyday skates, Slimlines have been my go-to frames. The groove is wide and they can incorporate bigger wheels all around. I bought a power blade setup a few months back and talk about speed. I'm skating Kizer Level 3, which fit huge wheels, and some Kizer powerblading wheels (Werbeski I think.) A whole new experience in blading. No experience with Kaltik, and my last experience with GC was bad, but quite a long time ago.  Happy trails."

rollerblading,2xqagq,thegigglepuss,2,Tue Mar 3 01:20:41 2015 UTC,Was the ankle pain related to how tight you had the cuff?  I don't have overly wide feet but I'll be looking at the Carbon 3's as a 2nd pair of skates soon.

If you want you can get a powerblading frame like the bigs, level3, or level2 which have an h block and you can hit more grinds (and a bit easier) than with the arrows or the advance frames. If money is an issue this will be very convenient. If you buy the frames ready to roll, you will not have to buy bearings or wheels, otherwise you will have to get all components (frames, wheels, bearings) separate."

But, if you're set on using the same setup for grinds they do a GC big setup that'd probably be better, lots of colours at the bottom of this page. I have read that some models of skates need slight modification to get them to fit though."
rollerblading,2xozix,greenstainedbrain,1 point,Wed Mar 4 11:19:53 2015 UTC,They do look pretty good but I don't think I can afford to spend that much on just the frame and wheels
rollerblading,2xozix,Largesaurus,2,Wed Mar 4 11:36:34 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm. Assuming you're looking exclusively at buying new, you're looking at spending probably £90 to £100 minimum. Because you're going for a flat ""powerblading"" setup, you're essentially having to buy 2 sets each of wheels, bearing spacers, and bearings because those are all usually sold in sets of 4 (sets of 8 for bearings, 2 for each wheel.)  It might be worth asking in either 'Blade Trade Europe' or 'UK blade trade & sell' groups on facebook, to see if anybody has stuff for sale in your price range."

Is this the first time back on blades in a while, nd how different are these than the last pair? Where do you say the pain is exactly (across the buckle strap, right at the top of the cuff or liner)?  Just so you know, it's likely just getting used to a different pressure than normal. This happens even after switching brands, and you've been skating for years. the more you skate (and take breaks in the middle), the less time it will take to go away. You are readjusting to life in plastic shells. (my opinion)"
rollerblading,2xm7ax,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Mon Mar 2 03:57:20 2015 UTC,Not very long. These are really different from the pair I had way back when. The pain is where the cuff clasp would be.
rollerblading,2xm7ax,Kordra,1 point,Mon Mar 2 04:07:21 2015 UTC,"This is very common when just getting into blading or getting completely new skates as those muscles (in the ankle region) are rarely used and become sore very easily .

What to practice.. What should I do to get going ect.. I'm really willing to put as much effort as it need to..  I'm asking for help as I culdnt find much through browsing and youtube.. However I gotta say I did try and stride here and there but my balance isn't as good,, and it feels like I'm doing something wrong...  I'd appreciate tips.. Links.. Advice and a guide if there any.. I'd appreciate the time for your help..  Thanks in adv"
rollerblading,2xh8tu,Zephyrlot,3,Sat Feb 28 18:03:14 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what worked for me.  The ideal roller blading position is with your knees bent, almost if you're doing a squat, although once you've gotten that down you can adhere less and less to it. If you want to go fast, keep your body low to the ground so you can use your legs more like a spring.  You accelerate by pushing off with one foot, then the other, and so on. Stopping can be done either with the brake attached to the back of the skate or, if your balance is good, dragging one skate behind you sideways so the wheels can't roll and just drag.  Once you feel generally okay going forward, accelerating, and braking, you should work on your balance. See how long you can skate on one foot. Chances are it'll be hard, but the longer and more comfortable you feel with one leg off the ground, the better balance you'll have and the more agile of a skater you'll be. Eventually it'll be effortless.  Once you've got balance mostly down, you can try crossing over. This is the most efficient way of turning on roller blades and can actually be used to accelerate. When making a turn, let's say, a left turn like one does in roller rinks, you pick your right foot up and bring it back down on the other side of your left foot, ""crossing over."" Then, you bring your left foot back. It's important to note that you'll be on one foot the majority of this time, but once again after a lot of practice it'll feel natural.  Here's a good video of it, since I suck at explaining things: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP628hZN7Ts#t=39  The next step is usually turning around and skating backwards, but I'm not very good at that yet and there are a lot of video guides on YouTube just for it. Happy skating!"

rollerblading,2xh8tu,Zephyrlot,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, actually! Try staying on one leg as often as you can. You don't have to be on the same one for too long, but try to make it so that right when your foot comes down, you push off the other one."
rollerblading,2xh8tu,Largesaurus,2,Sat Feb 28 19:47:24 2015 UTC,Ummm should i do that first while standing still( with the skates on ofcourse).. ? Then try while skating..  Btw my skates have a 90mm wheels.. Dunno if it makes a difference.. But ive been told its for speed rollbladers or something?
rollerblading,2xh8tu,Zephyrlot,1 point,Sat Feb 28 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"It's best done while going at a relatively slow pace.  90MM wheels will make mobility and turning corners on two skates a little harder, so crossing over will be that much more effective. Largesaurus also made a really good point with the camber angle - Try to keep your skates aligned directly up and down"

Remz have always been a kind of 2-3 per year kind of skate, but USD had a massive range in their hay day. Not mention K2 and Roces. So are razors really good now or just passionate?"
rollerblading,2xgrpp,KidneyAttic,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:12:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah Razors along with USD, Valo, Remz and Xsjado are among the top guns in skating at the moment! I was looking for the closest thing to Salomon, apparently Razors was it! Seriously love them, really recommend them when your Salomons give up the ghost! Valo took over Roces so the original Roces skates are still being produced but under the Valo umbrella. Not 100% sure about Remz, still going at a similar kind of rate I think. There are some pretty cool new companies about at the moment, I've been looking at Adapt, a Europeon hand-made company. I've personally never thought as K2 as one of the top guns so no idea what they are up! Almost 100% certain they haven't made skates for a while!

rollerblading,2xd4oh,Travis_Stewart,3,Fri Feb 27 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'll break down a few flaws with what I've seen, and a few things I like about it too.   Flaws:  shifty out of everything. So many shiftys.   Transitions between the top of the ramp and jumping in. Something is wrong with that animation. Can't put my finger exactly on it.  Does every spin have to include a mute grab?  Transition back down quarters. Needs more speed from the air. Case and point, that 720 into the mega quarter.   No grind transfers. Come on. We all played aggressive inline. Where dey at?  Over stylized. To much bloom and lens flair. Overly beautiful. (Possibly)  More true kind grinds then a /u/professional_fart.   Things I really liked:  The 450 bs backslide to wrap TTP. /drool. Seriously, looked amazing. Minus the whole 450 backslide part. Ha  The flatspin over the launch had the correct physics. Looked great.   The transfer from highbar to tranny the body tilt and setup to roll into the tranny looked good. Minus the spin, but still solid.   Transition from the back quarter to the mega quarter, minus the speed at the top of the second ramp, the physics looked good.   The rag doll fall was perfect, as was the clip and flip over the ledge.   Overall, the game looked far more polished than I expected.   end review  I'm excited to see the future of this, even if I'm extremely doubtful it will see the light of day (personal opinion). I hope they can iron out some of the things I've listed above, and expand on some of them as well. 7/10, would play in current state for hours."

rollerblading,2xc2zu,AlexDickle,6,Fri Feb 27 08:51:56 2015 UTC,Find a low curb and just keep stalling it over and over until you are used to the balance of having your feet in certain positions. When i do soul tricks most of my weight is on my soul foot which helps with wheels biting on ledges.
rollerblading,2xc2zu,HongKongCharlie,1 point,Fri Feb 27 11:19:16 2015 UTC,This guys right. Another good tip with royales is to not lean on your lead foot too much. Try to keep a kind of centre. I did this by trying to keep my balls over my back foots arch too.
rollerblading,2xc2zu,Citystarrz,6,Sat Feb 28 15:21:41 2015 UTC,"Hey dude. You are talking about pretty fine balance points and practise makes perfect brother. But for quick hints and tips I would say an important early one is, think about your balls. Allow me to explain.   On loads of grind tricks the balance point is somewhere close to when you have your balls over your h block my friend. Royals are a huge game changer to vocab but they are harder so start with souls probably. Try stepping on to soul grinds because it sounds like you're too far forward. Being in the right place with your body weight is key. Step on the soul foot, put most of your weight on that foot and just use the front foot as a guide. Maybe try step on makio first. It's a good way to learn where the weight is. Again, you want your balls over your H block. Next try and jump on the soul with both feet in the same position, getting the soul foot's knee boned over the ledge a little. This knee thing will also help you with the golden rule of balls over your groove my friend.   Once you're sliding it, learn it the other way. Switch seems hard at first but in years to come you will thank me my friend. Just remember, think about your balls."

rollerblading,2x9ozq,jokingrotten,4,Thu Feb 26 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"If you really want something like this, snowblades (or perhaps, i just learned, skiboards: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiboarding) are definitely your best bet.  These things might look kinda fun in the ad, but if you saw an ad for an above-ground pool, and had never before heard of above-ground pools, you might think it was a good idea!  As a very experienced skiier, i can almost guarantee you that these snowskates will not work very effectively when you attempt to use them on the mountain. They do not compromise with skis enough. They will be usable on an extremely limited amount of terrain, and  if anything more than 10cm of snow falls the evening prior, you can be assured an enjoyable day of hiking down the hill. Watch that ad again. The only terrain that they ski down is extremely smooth. Even worse, as the day goes on, runs which earlier were beautifully smooth from the previous night's grooming now acquire bumps of softer snow from the random ways in which people turn.  Snowblades are a little longer and heavier than rollerblades, certainly, but still remain hugely lighter than skis. Their additional length and weight lead to humongous progress in performance; the entire mountain, barring maybe a few extreme locations, is at your disposal.  There are some concerns that have been voiced over snowblade bindings, since they do not release. So there is probably a little bit of an increase in likelihood of you torquing a knee, but if you're looking for blading without blading, snowblades are your best bet.  I think backed up my reasoning properly? [5]"
rollerblading,2x9ozq,corgibuttzgaming,3,Fri Feb 27 02:04:06 2015 UTC,"Skiboarding:       Skiboarding is a winter sport which combines elements of skating, snowboarding, and skiing. Skiboards are used and worn in conjunction with standard ski boots that connect to the skiboards with use of a binding. Skiboards can be grouped into two general categories. Regular skiboards are generally 75-110 cm long, symmetrical, twin tipped. Modern skiboards share these characteristics but are also wider, and have more in common with snowboards, encouraging use of the edge during a session. Skiboarding is often incorrectly referred to as snowblading or skiblading, however, ""Snowblades"" are a trademark of Salomon. Further adding to the confusion, Salomon has ceased manufacturing skiboards, the product for which they coined the common name snowblades.    Image i - Skiboarder riding a rail.

We had one time venturing off to some of the more entertaining double blacks and the heaviest guy in our group (220+ lbs), sunk into the snow over and over if the snow hadn't been packed down.   They really do feel like skates, and it's so much fun just being able to push of and do spins like in the video. Great stopping power, easy to turn, but they do feel less stable at high speeds.  All said I'd go try them again.  Also tried the SnowBlades and they felt like a more stable version of the same thing (not able to skate, but you get a higher top speed)  Other variant was called Bigfoot ski skates which were about half way in between.

rollerblading,2x2a18,jacobismyname,3,Wed Feb 25 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend staying away from hills entirely until you are very comfortable braking on the flat.  The t-stop is your only real choice when it comes to managing speed on hills as it remains effective even at high speeds.  Improving balance honestly just comes down to practice. When learning a new skill, watch as many youtube videos as you can find and see what works for you personally. For me, focusing on staying low and maintaining a deep knee bend has solved pretty much every balance problem i've encountered skating.   Once you're able to t-stop stably on both sides you're probably ready to tackle some hills. To begin with, find one that leads directly to an uphill such that you will come to a stop even if you don't brake at all and get a sense for how braking feels at different speeds.   Approach new hills with caution as they're often steeper and longer than they appear at first glance. This is particularly important if you don't know what's at the bottom; the last thing you want is to find yourself flying into an intersection with no hope of stopping. Fear is what keeps us safe, and safety is the name of the game for you right now."
rollerblading,2x2a18,Dunescha,2,Wed Feb 25 07:20:40 2015 UTC,"actually i disagree (a lot) with the idea that t-stop is the only brake option in high speeds.  examples:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQQm0SoyByc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU41ZrPoQzA  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGfYBFRPmO8  T stops just make you acelerate slower insted of stopping you in steep hills, personally i like the ""tight slalom"" (its more like in the third link than the parallels of the first 2) since it can provide good speed control (but require a lot of empty room on your sides, at least a full road lane.   yes, those braking tecnices require A LOT of practice, but once you get it right its almost natural   edit: corrected the first link of the first video"
rollerblading,2x2a18,aruametello,2,Wed Feb 25 09:16:27 2015 UTC,"I probably should have mentioned the slalom as its definitely a great way of reducing speed while conserving rubber. That said, it's still mainly a pre-emptive measure and isn't that practical once you've built up some speed (especially on public roads).   The parallel slide is easily the fastest way to stop, but as you said you have to be pretty skilled to even do it, let alone do it well enough to be confident using it on the street. The t-stop is almost always going to give you more control, especially when you take into account how greatly road surfaces can vary (hit an oil patch doing a parallel and you're gonna have a bad time).  I just find that i don't ever want to be going fast enough that a t-stop is insufficient.  For a beginner the t-stop is, IMO, the single most important skill to learn."
rollerblading,2x2a18,Dunescha,3,Wed Feb 25 10:12:03 2015 UTC,"I'm still uncomfortable, it's been a long time. I don't trust gravity or myself. Just in it for the fun."
rollerblading,2x2a18,iluvmypups,2,Wed Feb 25 07:23:27 2015 UTC,"If I were you, the first thing I'd do is assess my risk profile - how old are you? How badly would injury affect you? Nobody wants to be injured, but that's why they're called accidents - you can only account for them, not predict the actual event.   The higher risk it would be for you to tackle a hill in the event of an accident, the slower I'd take it. When I first started skating, it wasn't a big deal to deal with injuries since I wasn't working.   Now for actually accelerating your rate of learning to ride on hills, I'd recommend looking for good hills to ride where the pavement is consistent and the road is straight and comes to an uphill at the end. It doesn't matter if its a very steep hill or even very long because you can start at different intervals of the hill and move up as you adjust to the speed and fear.   The key to hill bombing is, as others have said, feeling secure in your control of your skates. To have this confidence, I would recommend cutting slalom turns as hard as possible on flat ground with pads on until you understand the maximum amount of pressure your skates can take before sliding. Master at least two methods of stopping before going ham down a hill. I recommend the t-stop and the power slide. The t-stop because you have the maximum amount of control with the least use of space and it doesn't cause you to wipeout even when there is uneven ground. The power slide because you get a much faster stop than the tstop without much more wheel burn and without much more loss of balance since it's essentially a tstop in reverse.  The time frame of learning this level of confidence and control varies from individual to individual. If you're stupid like me, it will take less time and more I jury because people like me simply ""go"" instead of building up to it. I broke a finger trying to beat my brothers slalom time down a hill. People I teach take varied amounts time to learn hills - anywhere from 2 to 10 or more hour long skate sessions.   Tl;dr - confidence is key and you should build it by practicing."
rollerblading,2x2a18,haisojoko,2,Wed Feb 25 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"about 6 months, and i think 90% of the fear comes from not having a real way to stop when you need. (its a VERY real danger, in my group we had a dude with a exposed bone fracture in the leg that ignored this need for example) and about 10% comes from the actual speed (potential road rash)  what i did on those 6 months? practiced stopping techniques on (mostly) flat ground.  in short: if you really can stop when you want/need, the rest is mostly history.  tips from experience:   eyes on the road, ALWAYS. (no music or other distractions) know the surfaces in the path, if the route is new, go slow. unless you want scars, protection equipment is not a bad idea. (on the very least use a wrist guard) riding in the dark? carry a flashlight! its not just to see the ground in the dark, its also so other people can see you! find cheap wheels to buy, once you get ""addicted"" you may end buying 3+ sets of wheels a year. (there are some good ones on aliexpress)   on a personal note i also would recommend bigger wheels for a smoother ride if the asphalt is not perfect. (around here is awful, i maintain a 100mm setup and a 120mm for those, 76mm for the rest)  edit: formating"
rollerblading,2x2a18,aruametello,1 point,Wed Feb 25 09:30:54 2015 UTC,One of the things about rollerblades is that it's hard to stop on them. I've been blading for 19 years on and off and I'm still cautious around hills.
rollerblading,2x2a18,chowaniec,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"At one week, I don't think you should be tackling hills just yet. You need to have confidence in your speed control and emergency maneuvering. Being able to avoid a dangerous situation through instinctive movements rather than having a panicked voice in your head tell you what to do is a goal you should aim for.  Bombing down hills is NOT one of those things in life that only requires overcoming initial fear to accomplish. Bombing hills makes you scared because you should be, it's very dangerous. Always be aware of stationary and possibly moving obstacles all around you. That being said, once you feel comfortable enough on skates to the point where you feel like you could skate over different terrain, crowded areas, up and down stairs just as easily as walking, then you should be skilled enough to handle most hills that catch your eye. If you're determined enough, you could get very good at skating and balancing very quickly, you just need to push yourself to practice things you can't yet do, skating on one leg, and then backwards, turning, jumping, etc.   What you shouldn't do:   For actually skating the hill itself, you should NOT be using the t-stop a your primary method of control, I'd say that's a last resort if you can't stop any other way-plus it's actually dangerous at high speeds on a decline, you will very likely spin out with too much pressure on the breaking foot, or lose your balance when speed wobble starts to affect your one supporting leg. It also eats your wheels very quickly and isn't an enjoyable way to skate down a hill at all.   What you should do:   The closest thing there is to skating down a hill would be skiing, and the way that skiers control themselves is constantly turning their legs in parallel to make a slalom down the hill. THIS is what your primary method of speed control should be. Look at how this guy skates down a small incline, he doesn't drag his skates at all to control himself. That's a very good video to give you ideas on what else to work on with your skating.   Why you should slalom:   You turn yourself to shave off speed and momentum as well as slightly diminish the steepness of the hill you're on, all without grinding your wheels away(really try to take care of your wheels!). If you make harder turns until you are turning your skates perpendicular to the hill, you can skate the hill without the declining angle accelerating you. Something like this:   (__  __)  (__  __)   It's REALLY hard to format that properly(looks like ASCII art also isn't appreciated like it was in the 90's), but imagine that it like s-curves with the underscores being you skating perpendicular to the direction of travel(which is down the hill)  After that you could still continue the turn to make full circle like he did at 8:19 in the linked video above, and continue down the hill or stop. While you're learning it'd be helpful to find a hill with grass next to your skating surface so you can practice skating onto grass to avoid a crash or to slow down in an emergency."
rollerblading,2x2a18,Largesaurus,1 point,Thu Feb 26 01:12:34 2015 UTC,"there isn't a set time for this, it's completely dependent on the person. how comfortable are you going fast on a slight decline? if you're not very comfortable on skates in general that fear will transfer to any other aspect. it's best to learn the fundamentals that keep you feeling comfortable where ever you are. if you're a risk taker, or partake in any "" extreme"" sports that would help. but just go slow learn how it feels to go this fast, then this fast, etc. find what you're actually scared of, going fast, falling, speed wobbles and get right next to that fear until you're comfortable enough to overtake it. getting over this fear totally depends on the person."
rollerblading,2x2a18,gypsyblader,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:14:47 2015 UTC,"I remember the first time I ever went down a sizeable hill.  I was 15 and it was in downtown Montreal (st denis/sherebrooke, at the old d-structure if anyone wants to know). I was going the fastest I've ever gone, no idea how to stop, and a red light 20 meters infront of me.  I ditched into the sidewalk to try to grab onto things to stop, big mistake, I ended up rolling into a terrace and ran into a waiter on his way to serving people beers, got doused with beer, waiter fell, I fell, got yelled at, I bombed the rest of the hill to get away.  To answer your question, years, however I never really tried or did it actively until around 2007-08"

rollerblading,2x2a18,tempestpleb,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:17:23 2015 UTC,I stop slalom style or power slides. The T-stop is important to learn but its more or less a crutch. The only time I will use a T-stop is if I'm about to hit a car/pedestrian.
rollerblading,2x1xna,SWBoards,5,Wed Feb 25 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"You're probably thrusting your feet forward as you jumping onto the rail. This makes it easier to get up on the rail, but you will slip out more.  Make sure you retain a wide stance enough stance.  Lastly, if you are jumping onto down rails, you need to lean forward more than you think you do, and trust your feet to get on correctly."

rollerblading,2x1xna,citizenkrans,4,Wed Feb 25 01:03:18 2015 UTC,Getting a rail at home—even just a little PVC one—and practicing on it regularly will help out a lot.
rollerblading,2x1xna,punchboy,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"When you approach the rail, jump like you're going to jump over the rail. That's the key thing, I think. It helps get your body and feet where they need to be. Your weight needs to be completely over your feet, which will mean leaning forward a little more than you think.  You're going to pick up speed pretty quickly if it's a staircase, so just try to keep your body totally over your feet. Balance, man. Balance."

It was obviously a demo version so it still had plenty of glitches but that is to be expected I suppose. Good news, it looks dope and felt like it had a lot of tricks/options for the player although it's unfinished so was still clunky on some of the tricks with silly physics. Saw a couple of guys do moves which a little crowd clapped like a session so felt like the mo cap and stuff does draw you in and in some ( not all) cases made tricks look super cool. Overall I was pretty cynical gamer where this is concerned but having seen more of it now I can say it looked way better than the ads so far and I am now fully in excite mode.   Is rollerblading in trouble? Does it need saving? This probably isn't going to sell as well as the first good 3rd person skating game ever so yeah... Probably not.  I saw no pants.

rollerblading,2wrq2l,umhai,6,Sun Feb 22 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm going to strap on my Jacob Barnes tin foil hat for a minute.  I see a problem here. If the skate doesn't have stellar sales figures right out of the gate USD/Powerslide will decide sooner or later (probably sooner) that it's not worth supplying shops with the replacement boot/soul plate/frame and since three essential skate parts are now being manufactured as one ""it'd be easier for customers to just buy an entirely new skate when theirs wear out."" So that will instantly kill off the full appeal of a single piece replaceable shell/soulframe and opens up a scenario where people are getting used to buying new $200 skates every three months as opposed to every six, nine, twelve, etc.  So, what this does is it increases sales numbers without having to invest money into marketing and recruiting outside of rollerblading because you're selling to the same people it's just now they have to buy skates twice or three times as often.  And since Adapt Brand have shown themselves to be the only company to really try marketing outside of rollernews banners and sponsoring events in the last half decade this ""lazy"" approach to increasing sales seems like something USD/Powerslide might try.  If this stays exclusive to the world of price point beginner skates, fine, I'll just keep steering people toward the Cult but that seems doubtful if it really is replacing the Throne (official word is still out on that as far as I know.) Because it seems like they're trying to rope in beginners and the crowd who for whatever reason just don't like carbon skates and the USD carbon frees.  While there are some functional design benefits for throwing UFS out the window I don't think it's healthy for consumer options at the moment. The money isn't there in this industry to take a giant step back to the 90's but simultaneously pretend the ""replacement"" hardware we're promised will be readily available when they can just as easily say ""tough shit just replace the whole thing.""  I'm guessing 6 months to a year tops before this skate is fully disposable with no replacement shells available anywhere. If I'm wrong that's great, a new option for rollerbladers yay! But I have my reservations about what it is USD/Powerslide are actually trying to do with this skate.  Tin foil hat off.  Edit: Spelling, clarity."
rollerblading,2wrq2l,PROFESSIONAL_FART,5,Sun Feb 22 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"If there isn't that big a difference in the wholesale pricing of the complete and the shell, many shops may actually prefer to order the complete skate and part it out.   If for say, $40 more, they can get liners, wheels, bearings, cuffs, buckles, and shock pads, and those things aren't total garbage and have a good chance of selling individually (especially liners, I read somewhere they're going to come with the MyFit liner which is supposedly decent), it might make them more money.  What would be really progressive would be for Powerslide to make right/left shells available individually. Most people are heavily one-footed, and are stuck paying for twice as many parts as they actually need. Night always sold almost twice as many rights as lefts, for our non-symmetrical parts."
rollerblading,2wrq2l,aldolega,2,Sun Feb 22 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"and those things aren't total garbage   Thats a good point, but what are the chances a (potentially?) price point skate will actually have good wheels and bearings let alone heel pads? Doesn't really happen, so I'd imagine the wholesale pricing would have to be very very close for that to work.  Selling shells individually and not as a pair is some inspired thinking though. But I could imagine that being pretty tough on lefties. Who's going to stock lefty parts if they don't sell? Lefties would end up getting all their shells drop shipped from the distributor. Not that there aren't shops out there already doing business this way but it would still suck.  I'm down to try the skates out, but like I said, I'm skeptical and not much is going to change that short of riding them and seeing what Powerslide actually does with the product."
rollerblading,2wrq2l,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"I doubt these will be a price point (<$150) skate. Probably more like $200, at least for the first year or so. And I would expect the wheels & bearings to be midgrade. Like what comes on the non-pro Throne models. Shockpads aren't expensive to make so I see no reason for them to not be at least mediocre.  Lefty stuff would sell, just not as much as righty stuff. If Powerslide sells them individually there is no problem... no drop shipping, no falling sky. Shops just order more lefts and Powerslide gets more made."
rollerblading,2wrq2l,aldolega,3,Mon Feb 23 01:02:17 2015 UTC,It's an experiment someone was bound to try but I'm going to stay on the fence with my concerns in hand. I'm not going to be the first lining up to pay $200 or more for a non-ufs aggressive skate. Let's see how well USD stands behind the skate first. Maybe by Gen 2 I'll be thinking differently.
rollerblading,2wrq2l,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:56:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, crazy idea here, but since we're talking about the defenestration of a fundamental concept of skate design (UFS), why not design an ""ambipedal"" boot(identical boots for left and right feet)? Then there won't be the problem of leftover boots."
rollerblading,2wrq2l,Largesaurus,2,Mon Feb 23 02:02:17 2015 UTC,Do you think this skate could affect frame makers?
rollerblading,2wrq2l,Largesaurus,3,Mon Feb 23 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"Well no, not in and of itself. I think that even if it sells well and Powerslide supplies enough replacement shells to keep the skate maintained by owners (which is my main point of concern) it wouldn't start to become a threat to frame companies market share for at least a few years. And to outright put frame companies out of business you'd need a whole lot more than one model with two versions (aggro/PB) from one boot company to do it."
rollerblading,2wrq2l,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Mon Feb 23 02:16:04 2015 UTC,It would be an absolute tragedy if sudden popularity of this skate sends someone else under.
rollerblading,2wrq2l,Largesaurus,2,Mon Feb 23 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"No need to worry about that, it's not likely to happen. If anything puts a frame company out of business in the foreseeable future it will be their own business practices, not the Aeon.  As I said elsewhere in this thread, my main issue is whether or not USD is going to have replacement hardware available for any real length of time. I can easily see them dropping that aspect and treating this as a completely disposable skate within the first year if sales figures aren't high enough to continue selling just the boot/soulframe/frame shells.  The implications of abandoning UFS mounting are interesting to think about but we're still pretty far from that right now."
rollerblading,2wrq2l,PROFESSIONAL_FART,6,Mon Feb 23 08:08:16 2015 UTC,"Aeon is one solid piece, so once you wear out your frames or soul plate you need a whole new boot. If I was forced to pick one of these I'd go with the throne, if I had a choice id pick anything but these two"
rollerblading,2wrq2l,drount,3,Sun Feb 22 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Also there are two versions: Flat 60mm and 72mm.   It has been said that given that they do not have to follow UFS (the frame is on piece with the boot) the frames are much lower (similar to a 56-57mm setup) with a very nice h-block.   Additionally, the price for the boot-soul-frame will be around 80€, so if you wear out one of the said parts, that will be the cost of getting a replacement (+ you get almost a fresh skate). This 80€ is without cuff (the only replaceable part apart from wheels and bearings).   Nick Lomax is very happy with its performance as he reported in several social media."

rollerblading,2wrq2l,Largesaurus,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:06:15 2015 UTC,"this isn't completely on topic, but this thought just popped into my head - I wonder if making a huge replaceable middle part of the frame like ground control did with formula 1's would compromise the structural integrity that you gain from not being UFS. That seems like it could offer the options that everyone is worried about losing without UFS"
rollerblading,2wrq2l,myusernamesalwayssuc,2,Mon Feb 23 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"So, a jumbo h-block? That's the same as having UFS. Then there will have to be yet more parts made for the revolution of the (*all-new and improved)  ""universal block system""."

rollerblading,2wk6bp,1foxman1,2,Fri Feb 20 16:26:20 2015 UTC,First of all stop skating in the rain! Here's a few videos to watch that should walk you through properly maintaining your bearings.   Bearing basics  How to change your bearings  How to clean bearings
rollerblading,2wk6bp,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Feb 20 16:38:13 2015 UTC,thanks! why not skate in the rain? (well except for the safety hazard)
rollerblading,2wk6bp,raffraff89,2,Fri Feb 20 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"Your bearings aren't clogged up, they're rusted up.  And you can't go fast on wet surfaces so it isn't fun, for me anyway."
rollerblading,2wk6bp,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Fri Feb 20 18:16:47 2015 UTC,"probably both :(, thanks"
rollerblading,2wk6bp,Largesaurus,2,Fri Feb 20 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Apart from the safety issue, like someone else said, if your bearings aren't gunked up with mud they're probably just starting to rust. (though a combination of the two seems probable) By not going out for a skate in damp and rainy conditions you won't ruin your bearings.  You can try using the links I provided to clean your bearings but there's a decent chance you'll just end up having to replace them all together. But keep those links on hand to maximize the life out of any bearings you buy in the future. Regular maintenance on your skate hardware does wonders for your comfort and assures you're always getting the most out of your equipment."
rollerblading,2wk6bp,Largesaurus,2,Fri Feb 20 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"Aw man, I didn't know skates could rust, too bad. Guess I'll take them apart and order a cleaning kit/new bearings. thanks a lot for the info"

rollerblading,2wgqnx,Largesaurus,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:51:29 2015 UTC,"I like black boots, white frames, some weird pastel wheel. But that's me."
rollerblading,2whjss,chowaniec,3,Thu Feb 19 23:29:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the wheel is coming apart. Did you twist the bearings out of the wheels when you removed them? Or did you use a bearing press? The twisting possibly warped the core and tore the urethane off the hub. :(  Also to note, not the end of the world. If it's small it won't matter that much. But if the wheel continues to get louder or slower, it's Cored."
rollerblading,2whjss,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Fri Feb 20 02:10:56 2015 UTC,"I used an allen key for one side and a bearing puller for the other. Seems like it was some kind of alignment thing; it's fixed, at least rolling around my kitchen. We'll see what happens next session."
rollerblading,2whjss,aruametello,2,Fri Feb 20 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"its likely a debonding between the polyurethane rubber and the plastic core of the wheel. (the noise is caused by a friction of those materials because when you apply pressure on the wheel, the rubber deforms more/less than the plastic)  if that happened after a session with a lot of jumping (or similar impacts) its pretty likely its the wheels and its unlikely to be fixed without replacing them... what i did to some that fixed it (somewhat) was to apply a tiny amount of lubrication between the ""rubber"" and ""plastic"" on the wheel by pushing a thick needle though the rubber. (fixed 90%+ of the noise but i don't recommend at all)"
rollerblading,2whjss,Warkid1993,1 point,Fri Feb 20 05:22:21 2015 UTC,"when you're standing and you lean your boot over topside or whatever, does it make that noise?  it might be your frame. i used to have that problem with (i think) the ground control FL2, or it might have been my 2012 creates...i forget the frame but i'll never forget the annoying sound. It will be irritating, but that's it. i believe it has to do with the spacers"
rollerblading,2whjss,bladedvox,1 point,Fri Feb 20 11:53:35 2015 UTC,I bought crappy Undercover Blank wheels and they started doing this.. at first i thought it was bearings but after trying like three different sets of bearings I am pretty sure the wheel is just coming apart or something
rollerblading,2whjss,Warkid1993,2,Sat Feb 21 04:20:01 2015 UTC,Second. If you get UC blanks don't use them for a freestyle/anti setup because this will inevitably happen. (Which is why there is a weight warning/recommendation on the product description?)
rollerblading,2whjss,SalamiSlide,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:43:23 2015 UTC,I never saw a warning when i bought them but at least they were cheap.

rollerblading,2wbq00,Vulgar_Slaughter,4,Wed Feb 18 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Keep your knees bent and your weight forward.  It's easier to save yourself from falling forward than from falling backwards.  Also, position one foot in front of the other ever so slightly or as much as you need to maintain your balance.  Keeping them side by side at your shoulders isn't as easy as having one just in front of you and one slightly behind."
rollerblading,2wbq00,PatSayJack,3,Wed Feb 18 18:12:17 2015 UTC,"This is a very difficult thing to teach using words only.   My advice would be to go slowly at first: ride up the wall as far as you feel comfortable, then turn and ride back down. In small increments, increase your speed, until you are rising to below the coping. This might take several sessions.  While a smaller quarterpipe might seem less scary to learn on, the abrupt transition makes it more difficult. Of course, don't go hitting the most monstrous quarter you can find, but something 5-6ft high is probably best.  Something that made dropping in a little easier when learning is to not approach the quarterpipe dead on. when you drop in for the first time (and probably for the 10 times after), I'd advise skating parallel to the coping at low speed, then dropping in at an angle. Going straight into the quarter is more difficult, but can be eased into by gradually increasing the angle at which you approach the quarter.  Finally, feel free to use knee pads and wrist guards! They are extremely useful for leaning to skate quarters in particular. If you fall, you simply slide down the quarter on your hands and knees!  Good luck, mysterious internet stranger."
rollerblading,2wbq00,jokingrotten,2,Thu Feb 19 01:07:00 2015 UTC,"It really just takes practice, but the key is learning to shift your weight around. Lean forward when dropping in, and as you come off the ramp, stand upright."
rollerblading,2wbq00,chowaniec,2,Wed Feb 18 16:50:10 2015 UTC,So am I right about keeping low and pushing my legs in front of me? Do I just need to straighten my back out once my legs start getting on the almost vertical bit?
rollerblading,2wbq00,chowaniec,2,Wed Feb 18 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Keeping low (keeping your knees bent, really) is definitely a good idea.  Are you talking about going up a quarter, or down?"
rollerblading,2wbq00,keepinitcool,3,Wed Feb 18 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry, I meant going up.   I was able to get going up and down the ramps no problem, but there's something about the steep rise up the quarters. I guess I just don't know how to judge my movement on them yet and react accordingly. I want to get myself feeling comfortable on them before I try dropping in."

I'm not really interested in competitions, nor am I interested in freestyle skating. It just seems really appealing to get into long-distance skating (outdoors).

rollerblading,2w5l4r,FluroBlack,2,Thu Feb 26 17:04:44 2015 UTC,It really depends on how comfortable you are on skates and how much you are willing to spend. If you are looking more for speed the lower cut boots are better but more difficult to get used to as you will need to build up strength in your ankles. I don't know a whole lot about the higher cut recreational skates. I would check out nettracing.com for some good quality brands. Luigino is a very popular brand and makes overall good skates. They do have some Powerslide skates as well on that site that have a higher cut boot if that's what you are looking for. I hope this was helpful for you and good luck!

rollerblading,2w59sa,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Tue Feb 17 21:25:38 2015 UTC,Here's the r/rollerblading buyers guide. This should help you navigate your way through the pros and cons of current skate models available.  Shop Task is your best bet for ordering in Canada.  If you have any specific questions about skates I'd be happy to try helping you out. I know we have a few users from that area so hopefully they'll chime in eventually.
rollerblading,2w4s2i,PROFESSIONAL_FART,6,Mon Feb 16 23:38:51 2015 UTC,Nice one man !
rollerblading,2w4s2i,greenstainedbrain,6,Tue Feb 17 00:05:10 2015 UTC,Great list!

rollerblading,2w4s2i,meparadis,3,Tue Feb 17 00:21:19 2015 UTC,wow im amazed
rollerblading,2w4s2i,panic2695,2,Tue Feb 17 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the list, maybe this can be added to the top bar? like a ""media"" section for must-see videos, podcasts, and print/digital mags. And sorry about your foot :/"
rollerblading,2w4s2i,Largesaurus,2,Tue Feb 17 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"No problem! You read my mind actually. Travis and I are about to start podcasting here in a few minutes. Making a change to the multi-tabs was something I was going to bring up before we start the recording. So sit tight, there might be some changes coming soon."
rollerblading,2w4s2i,Largesaurus,2,Tue Feb 17 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"Cool, and one other general thing, if you are going to change the tabs, might I suggest making them stand out a bit more/put them somewhere else so people won't overlook them? Other than that, you guys are doing a great job here."
rollerblading,2w4s2i,KidneyAttic,2,Tue Feb 17 04:29:35 2015 UTC,This has made me very happy. Basically all video sites and a load of other sites (including Bemag) are blocked at my work.   This will help me get my fix during the day!! You're doing good work man.
rollerblading,2w4s2i,greenstainedbrain,2,Wed Feb 18 10:32:04 2015 UTC,"Anyone got any links to an online version of Unity magazine ?  Would be much appreciated i used to read the shit out of them back in the day. I searched the attic for the originals but couldn't find them, just an old copy of Daily Bread the Tokyo Japan edition"
rollerblading,2w4s2i,unseemlycad,2,Wed Feb 18 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"Wow. You've done a really special thing here. I obviously knew we had a rich and diverse culture and history but going back and flicking through these, it really brings it home. Go find the Mike Opalek Bribes Senate Ad. It's so dated, so of the past that it can only be seen as part of a rich history. It's fucking rad to look back at these like I used to look at my neighbours 70s skateboarding magazines when I was a little kid. Such rich heritage here. Big big smile on my face right now."

I feel like the V13 has great flex, and is light enough to stay out of the way. They are super narrow, and I have narrow feet. I'm usually a 7.5 in sneakers and I roll a 7 with a Trust Spec Ops liner. I could have gotten away with an 8 as the stock liner is much thicker and better than the TV liner. I'll by Valo the rest of my life. Happy Hunting and welcome back!"

rollerblading,2w10co,KidneyAttic,3,Mon Feb 16 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"Might as well get BIG frames. It doesn't really matter, they'll still feel tiny compared to the 100mm wizard set up and at least thats a frame you haven't skated yet, right?"

Thinking about ordering the Lomax thrones. Idk why they never made it stateside."
rollerblading,2vxf29,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Sun Feb 15 17:21:54 2015 UTC,"I feel ya man, that makes sense. Keep your eyes peeled though, USD is rereleasing the first throne colorway at some point this year. (sorry I'm not sure of a specific time but I'd imagine for the summer line) It should be pretty easy to find.  And if you're a big fan of classic thrones you'll probably want to stock up if you can afford it. The rumors are that it's the last throne and they'll being replaced by the Aeon."

Now when you put the wheels in your frames, you will have to line up the holes to put in your wheel bolts. A little more difficult than it sounds. I use an allen wrench or a screw driver to line up the holes, and then voila. Put in your bolts and ready to roll."

I did go on but it was just a reaction to alot of other comments i have seen regarding his edits in general. alot of people have been taking shots at his edits lately and i just dont get it because it generaly matches his style, so many people have been cursing the tracks he uses and the style of edits.  sorry if you felt it was directed at you, not my intention, i just felt the need to share is all.

rollerblading,2vseiw,harlequin_forest,2,Fri Feb 13 19:55:22 2015 UTC,What is the difference between fr1's and 2? Also what size did you get relative to shoe size? I hear that they break in about half a size? So If I buy lets say size 11 they will eventually be 11.5? Or do they come sort of small? Like a 11 is a 10.5
rollerblading,2vseiw,harlequin_forest,1 point,Fri Feb 13 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"The diff between 1 & 2 is minor. 1 has slightly better bearings, a metal buckle instead of plastic on the top strap (or the bottom can't remember) and more 7 mount holes under the boot for variety of blade positions (fr2 has 3 mount holes). Most say stock position is fine anyways. 2013 fr1 is black/white color combo where fr2 is all black. 2014 fr1 & 2 are both all black color.   There is a break in period. The boots are super tight at first but expand a bit and form to your feet.  As far as sizing I am a size us 10 and ordered a us 10 skate (aka eu 43, seba's are based in Europe). Call the shop your ordering skates from and ask what they think would be best for you, also follow this video guide on sizing to determine your correct skate size (vid is from shop//task, I ordered mine through them) http://youtu.be/c4_aN-I8afI"

rollerblading,2vmewf,StupidButSerious,3,Thu Feb 12 05:07:48 2015 UTC,"A few things here -  You can always upgrade the bearings. You may have to watch a few videos to learn how to do it properly, but they're pretty much universal in size (Not experienced in this - May be wrong).  As for the upper curved lock thingy, you may have a size too big. Skates sometimes need time to break in, and a soft boot skate that feels a little snug will wear into the shape of your foot gradually.   The ankle movement freedom CAN be a blessing, but if you like it really tight then yeah the loose straps would be a bad idea.  I can personally recommend rollerblade skates, in particular the tempest and igniter. The igniters are what I own, and haven't failed me yet as well as being as tight as I want to lace them, although the tempest is much more popular overall. (the macroblade series ought to be fine too)  Also, I cannot recommend enough taking a lap or two to get used to the new wheels sizes, at least for the K2s, before buying them. Going up in wheel size would mean a longer frame, which can hinder mobility and stopping speed (although you can skate much faster).  I hope this helps!"
rollerblading,2vmewf,Zephyrlot,3,Thu Feb 12 07:01:39 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the bearings, if they're spinning for 20 seconds they're absolutely fine. The impact bearings have on skating performance is pretty negligible unless they're in really bad shape."
rollerblading,2vmewf,Dunescha,3,Thu Feb 12 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"Bearings often have too much greace in them when they are new, and will loosen up with some use.  Also, i'd look at hard shell (Freeride/Slalom) skates, adds little extra weight but it's worth it."
rollerblading,2vmewf,Domsablos,3,Thu Feb 12 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'll add my vote to RB skates. Regarding loose ankle boots, its perfectly normal in skates with sizes 90-100mm - these skates are typically geared toward fitness skating, in which the grip on your ankles is much looser to allow for a wider stride. One thing you are going to miss out with fitness skates is control and agility in favour for speed and comfort over rough terrain/roads.  I've had the RB10's (hard boot 90mm fitness skates, I believe these days its been re-branded into the Maxum line of skates by RB) and even Crossfires (which are soft shell 90mm) and if I'm perfectly honest with you, I still prefer my Twisters. The larger frame needd for the 90-100mm wheels come at the cost of agility and manoeuvrability (is that a word?), and you essentially feel like you have a pair of skis or snow plowers strapped to your feet. I didn't like it.  But then again most my skating is urban, for which the Twisters are perfect, and offer the millimetre-precision I like and the comfort needed even for long haul skating sessions (50+ km). If most your skating really is going to be long haul, basically straight line on asphalt skating, and you've no interest in anything other than hitting the asphalt and stretching your legs for long strides, go with any of the 90-100mm models RB offers. The Maxum may offer a little better grip than the  soft shell boots. But Id still say stick to 80mm wheels and get a good all round pair like the Twisters. Hell go Twister Pro. That new boot and frame is the ultimate in urban skate comfort at a very reasonable price point. any higher and you are better off looking at Seba or Powerslide skates."

rollerblading,2vhzwn,Xenni,3,Wed Feb 11 03:57:09 2015 UTC,"You need to learn to rotate your wheels. It's normal that they wear out faster on one side than the other, so rotating them helps them last longer.  In my opinion, better bearings will make a bigger difference than better wheels when it comes to rolling. Though of course getting both is ideal."
rollerblading,2vhzwn,keepcalmrollon,2,Wed Feb 11 04:14:31 2015 UTC,"I was intending on getting better bearings during my trip down, I do try to make an effort to rotate my wheels aswell but I do get rather lazy about it since I usually just want to get out and skate when the urge hits. Thanks for the advice though!"
rollerblading,2vhzwn,what_is_this_life,3,Wed Feb 11 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming your skates came with the razors stock wheels, which are absolutely terrible. If you got more than one or two sessions out of them, you're doing better than most people I've seen. As far as wheels, I'd suggest eulogy as I've had the best luck with them being durable. Street artist and undercover are pretty good as well. With the turning thing, if you're riding anti rocker (not all four wheels touching the ground when you're rolling) turning radius is heavily affected. You learn to adjust accordingly, by either taking wider corners or applying more crossover techniques. If it's a big deal for you, you can skate 4 wheels down but as a rule it's heavier and it's a lot easier to catch a wheel while grinding. Hope this helps."
rollerblading,2vhzwn,hifire,2,Wed Feb 11 06:04:23 2015 UTC,"I thought the stocks would be bad, but I never thought that they would be that bad ._.  The only place I can find Eulogy wheels in Aus is on skaterhq which has some pricey shipping down to my area.. (Can any Australians verify as to whether bayside has them aswell?)  Thanks for the help with the turning though, I felt pretty off on day one and had been making dozens more crossovers to make up for the shorter turning radius, just wasn't sure if I was doing it right!"
rollerblading,2vhzwn,hifire,2,Wed Feb 11 11:52:57 2015 UTC,"Another Australian here, unfortunately all of our stores are damn expensive and the selection of stock is slim at best.  I guess its a reflection of how few inliners there are down here.  Usually it would be cheaper to just buy from inlinewarehouse/aggressivemall/etc (even with shipping) but our dollar is dropping so badly at the moment that I'm not sure if the saving is either worth the wait for delivery or actually cheaper.  That being said I order my stuff from the US just because they have a wider selection and so I don't mind paying a bit and waiting a few weeks.  Edit - Brisbane based btw."

rollerblading,2vcbli,jopeymonster,3,Tue Feb 10 19:57:40 2015 UTC,"There is a difference.  There are 3 ""colors"" of thread lock; blue, orange, red.  Blue is used for standard applications and requires a minimal amount of torque to break, best suited for plated or stainless steel applications where common servicing is done.   Orange and Red can sometimes be the same thing, but if you find an orange separate from the red, the orange is a lower hardening agent then red (EDIT - hardening degrees are rated, Blue is reference at 242, red is 271).  Red and orange are both used for high end industrial, commercial or automotive applications.  The difference is that red/orange usually require heat to break the bonds (somewhere in the 500 degree F area) although you can break it with your human strength.  If you tried to crank out the axle, you may likely bend the tool (happens a lot).  As to why Seba uses the red - they like to make the customer feel like they bought a solid product, which they did.    Blue works just fine for EVERY inline skating application, so do yourself (and your hands, arms, and skate tools) a favor and just use blue when re-securing your axles/skate parts.  Not using thread lock?  Have fun with that....  Source: I use lots of thread lock for many applications, including building skates daily."
rollerblading,2vcbli,wisdom_possibly,2,Mon Feb 9 22:06:06 2015 UTC,I lost an axle today.  Took a nasty spill in front of some cute Japanese girls.  Can confirm: use thread lock.
rollerblading,2vcbli,Stickeesox,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:14:57 2015 UTC,I broke a tool off in my Sebas. That was annoying.
rollerblading,2vcbli,chowaniec,-1,Wed Feb 11 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"As opposed to blue threadlocker, or just in general? Blade parts have a nasty habit of coming loose with vibration, so most companies use threadlocker as a precaution. Red vs. blue just has to do with the brand."

rollerblading,2v9bvt,Hiptalamus,2,Mon Feb 9 02:47:16 2015 UTC,"There are some specialist off road skates but i wouldn't recommend them, if you can roll across patches of dry grass on most skates.  and Skate recommendations? my first pair were Rollerblade Twisters which are indestructible, depends on your budget tho.  And make sure they fit nice and tight."
rollerblading,2v9bvt,Domsablos,2,Mon Feb 9 12:20:52 2015 UTC,"It just depends on your budget.  Also usually you can skate on patches of grass just as long as you don't get water within the bearings otherwise you'll have to take them out and clean them before they start to rust.    My skate recommendations would be  Rollerblade Fusion X7 - Always on sale, just find the right size. Otherwise really good skate  Seba FR2  K2 Fit 80  Rollerblade Fusion X3"
rollerblading,2v9bvt,ScoopJr,1 point,Mon Feb 9 14:47:52 2015 UTC,How important do we reccon having a heel break is for a beginner?
rollerblading,2v9bvt,Domsablos,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:25:26 2015 UTC,"I can only assume in my haste to reply that the blades i linked had no rear brake.  Rollerblade Fusion X3 - Yes they come with a rear brake.  I had initially believed that the Fusion X7's did as well because i remembered taking them off but not entirely sure if that is still the case.  The K2 Fit 80 seem to be a really good skate as well.  As far as importance goes, i'd say if you have never skated and plan to teach yourself how to skate and learn along with the proper padding and protection, then its essential.  However after a while just like training wheels on a bike it will usually end up coming off once you get more comfortable and learn how fast you can go, and learn different ways of stopping without the brake. In my own experience i don't think i used the rear brake pad all that much.  I probably first learned about skates having them when i purchased my X7's and they came with the skates.  Is it essential to learn with the rear brake?  In most cases its beneficial however its entirely possible to learn without just a lot more difficult to learn."
rollerblading,2v9bvt,ScoopJr,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:38:59 2015 UTC,I disagree. Heel brakes are inefficient and don't serve much purpose beyond providing the illusion of control. They're more a mental crutch than a useful piece of hardware.  In my opinion it's best for beginners to never use them. A T-stop is more effective. There's a reason no advanced skaters of any discipline bother with a brake so if you don't rely on one to begin with it's one less bad habit you have to break down the line.
rollerblading,2v9bvt,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:44:00 2015 UTC,Interesting!  I wonder why even bother including them if they don't even help.
rollerblading,2v9bvt,ScoopJr,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:02:37 2015 UTC,Yeah no break on the Sebas either they are my favourites but I hesitate to reccomend them for that reason. Not a huge fan of the k2's either but only because most rec skates are poor.
rollerblading,2v9bvt,Domsablos,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"Well, Poor skates but not entirely not useful for someone looking to start off in skating and not really looking to spend a whole lot.  If they like it, then sure spend more money on a better skate.  If not then not a whole lot of money spent."

rollerblading,2v6enh,PROFESSIONAL_FART,5,Sun Feb 8 08:33:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but I get a feeling that if one of them breaks or bends when going through a turn at 40 km/h, that's gonna be... unfortunate."

rollerblading,2up8dc,Travis_Stewart,27,Wed Feb 4 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"Hey there, this is Alexander Broskow. I'm a 29 year old aggressive skater from Kansas City, Missouri. But I'm currently living in Portland, Oregon. I've been skating for 21 years and I'm not sick of it yet! I'm looking forward to answering your questions, so I'll see ya on the 13th."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,3,Wed Feb 4 03:14:51 2015 UTC,"mr broskow, i don't have a question but just wanted to say thanks for the countless hours of entertainment watching in awe of your skills. keep on rolling!"
rollerblading,2up8dc,adrock3000,3,Fri Feb 13 13:44:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks a lot! I'll do my best to keep it going."

rollerblading,2up8dc,k2rolla503,2,Wed Feb 4 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"Is this just gonna be 3 Portlanders talking to themselves? In all seriousness just wanted to say I'm a huge fan, and still have your TRS skate."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,2,Wed Feb 4 05:46:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That's really sick, I don't even have those. Keep em crispy."
rollerblading,2up8dc,Warkid1993,12,Fri Feb 13 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on ""Powerblading"" or at least the recent popularity for 72mm flat?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,11,Wed Feb 4 14:58:56 2015 UTC,"Umm I honestly don't care for it. I especially don't like the term. If you want to skate big wheels and go fast that's sick. Go for it! Get some aluminium frames and 80mm+ wheels and boom it. Back in the day we all skated Hyper FatBoys, it's not a new thing. But I'm a anti-rocker skater, so it doesn't really appeal to me."
rollerblading,2up8dc,Vulgar_Slaughter,9,Sat Feb 14 00:00:30 2015 UTC,"Two questions here.  Which of your edits or sections do you feel is your best? The one that fully showcases your talent.  There are plenty of skaters of who still roll Salomons exclusively (myself included), and I've read online that Valo apparently have the moulds for Salomon skates. Given that Valo basically made their name by selling a Roces majestic boot with a new soul system, do you know (or could you possibly find out) if Jon has any plans to do the same with Salomons? I honestly think that if done right these would fly off the shelves."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,4,Thu Feb 5 02:40:29 2015 UTC,"That's very hard to answer, I really can't say. I like some of the older ones for a lot of different reasons. The Meantime will always be one of my favorites. That video was a huge part of all of our lives, and so was Brandon. But I always try to make each part better and different from the last and I'm my biggest critique. I really don't think I can choose one I like the best. But Voodoo Show is up there, it was a lot of fun to make.   I don't know anything about the Salomon moulds. But as long as you don't have wide body's its cool with me."
rollerblading,2up8dc,Xsjado-Blades,9,Sat Feb 14 00:14:40 2015 UTC,What tips would you give to a novice aggressive skater?
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,7,Thu Feb 5 08:47:36 2015 UTC,"Keep skating, keep having fun, stay aggressive and make it look cool. Also skate as much as possible, that's important."
rollerblading,2up8dc,phio666,10,Sat Feb 14 00:16:50 2015 UTC,"I really just want to say thanks. Your skating along with many others has shown me that the sport is still very much alive and there is still so much to be done.   Do you have any goals set for the next few years? Such as tricks or spots you've always wanted to do but felt like you haven't been able to yet or just waiting for the right time.  Out of everything you have ever done with rollerblading, what do you think is your biggest achievement? I would love for your answer to be a trick or a section, but if it's just the fact that you're still doing it or that it brought you to Portland or that you've met so many great people because of it, that's great.   Thanks again for continuing to make such a strong and positive impact on rollerblading.   P.S. I loved the ice skating edit you guys made one year. We need more of that."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,8,Sat Feb 7 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"Wonderful, thanks! My goals are really just to keep making cool shit. Work with cool people and go cool places. Put out good content. Show skating the way I like it I guess. We want to make another Vibralux video, hopefully we can make that happen. The launch of American made Vibralux is huge for us and whats to come for DEAD.  I'd say my biggest achievement is just still being able to do it and having done it at all. I think about it everyday. But also skating for Valo, working with Jon and having him as a boss is unreal. If you would have asked me that 10 years ago the answer would've been skating for Senate."
rollerblading,2up8dc,joey_mc,9,Sat Feb 14 00:33:30 2015 UTC,Are you still drug and alcohol free?  If so... how much do you think this helps your focus and work ethic in skating?
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,8,Thu Feb 12 22:45:36 2015 UTC,I am. I'm really not sure because this is the only way I know. I imagine it helps a decent amount but since I don't know the other side I really can't say.
rollerblading,2up8dc,Largesaurus,10,Sat Feb 14 00:36:26 2015 UTC,What's your opinion on mushroom blading and of the bladers who say it's making rollerblading gay?
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,18,Fri Feb 13 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"We were ""gay"" long before they came around. I think they're cool, they love skating and they sure as hell have a lot of fun so I back em."
rollerblading,2up8dc,Largesaurus,6,Sat Feb 14 00:38:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying this.
rollerblading,2up8dc,tomanizzle,7,Sat Feb 14 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"I have to post these considering I managed to buy them 10 years later practically untouched.  http://instagram.com/p/yqP85GHN4g/?modal=true  Other than stretching, what do you do to warm up to skate? Do you have a safety trick, or are you at the point in your career that you'd be able to lace anything you please as soon as you get to the spot?  Did spinning both ways just come easy to you or did you have to work at it? The fackie 720s you did in kfc3 always blew my mind.  As one of the top bladers in the game, is there anything that you've done recently to help get new kids into some blades?  You've brought back numerous tricks back into the spotlight. Is there any chance we'll be seeing steezy sidewalk grinds next or is that just impossible?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,4,Fri Feb 13 01:21:07 2015 UTC,"Haha damn that's sick. Keep em clean. I kinda just roll around and mess around, get loose. Safety tricks depend on the spot. Sometimes the safety trick is the trick. But usually the classic royale and topsoul come first. And I love frontsides and backsides, probably my favorite. When I was little I thought I spun to the left then I realized I didn't. That's how spinning both ways came about. I just try to go to skateparks and be nice to the kids, show em what skating looks like. Tell them where to buy skates if they ask. The sidewalk shouldn't come back haha."

rollerblading,2up8dc,aldolega,8,Thu Jun 4 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"*I'm sure you- like most other bladers skilled enough to translate foreign concepts into their blading- draw at least some inspiration from outside of blading itself. And of course there's plenty of inspiration from within blading itself to draw on. Care to share what some of each type of these influences are/have been, why you were drawn to them, and how you balance (if at all) the two types of influence, and if/how they may ever conflict?  *What type of terrains/obstacles would you like to see explored more by bladers?  *Do you feel you could put together an entirely non-grinding profile (ala something like Mike Torres' Nogrinderblading ) that was up to your personal standards of progression and creativity? How do you think this would be received by the blade community?  *Did you get to skate the CRS prototypes enough to have an idea of whether you'll be riding them permanently? Or are you still undecided until you ride them more?  *What's something about your blading that bugs you, or you're unsatisfied with? Perhaps something you were able to overcome, or to just stop letting it bother you?  *Hypothetical: you are given a house, on the condition that you must build ramps/obstacles (or have them built) in the 2,000sq/ft garage/warehouse that's on the property, and film an edit of the garage every year for the next five years. What do you build? Do you change/rearrange the ramps/obstacles once you've gotten an edit out of them, or do you build something permanent and try to just completely master it over those five years?  *Your favorite pro product of your career? Of someone else's?  *You are granted the power to magically change or remove one common behavior or attitude in every blader worldwide, instantly and without anyone realizing. What is it, and how do you change it?  *Every body breaks down and every career ends. Do you see yourself remaining involved in blading after you step down as a pro skater? Or do you already have plans/ideas for something different, when you get to that point? What do you hope will be your career's lasting contribution to the sport, outside of your skating itself?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,7,Fri Feb 13 05:09:50 2015 UTC,"Whoa..  My main influence would probably be hockey since I played before I started skating and I learned to skate on ice. And of course all the skaters I looked up to when I was young. I don't think there are any conflicts. Nowadays I'd say from all my friends, all the people I skate with. I just want to see people not skating boring skate spots. Use your mind, get creative. You can do so much on skates. Umm, I could probably do it. But I don't think it'd be very entertaining. Grinding is one of the most interesting and intricate things we have. I skated them, they're great! I'll probably bounce back and forth between the two. Unless the spot calls for CRS frames.  I wish I could jump higher :-/ I'd have the up flat down rail from Modern. For 5 years. Valo AB.1s and v13 coffees, most definitely. And Roadhouse Crayolas. Make them cooler, not socially awkward, more confident and loose the chip on the shoulder. Remaining in skating is the dream inside the dream. If our industry let that happen it's absolutely what I would want to do. If not working with coffee would be a lot of fun.  Shit, I don't know what I'd hope my lasting contribution would be. That's kinda heavy."
rollerblading,2up8dc,Largesaurus,3,Sat Feb 14 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"lol, I read the hypothetical question as ""you are given a horse,"" and wondered where in the edit the horse would come into play."

First, what was the hardest yet most simple trick for you to learn?   Second, would you ever film an episode of ""B.L.A.D.E"" with Chris Haffey?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,7,Thu Feb 12 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"Haha thanks. That's tough, maybe farfs because when they came out it was really hard with how our skates were. Really soft plastic, huge grooves and there wasn't a soul plate so the boot was farther away. I remember thinking ""What! I just got royales good, now I have to learn them the other way?!?"" It was heavy to wrap your mind around back then. I'd try one but I think Chris would win, he's really good haha."
rollerblading,2up8dc,jaysuperdavehenson,7,Sat Feb 14 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"He's big, but you're technical. Besides, if I had to choose any two skaters to battle it out in a game of B.L.A.D.E it would be you and Richie Eisler. Best styles in the game."

What is it about skating that you love so much?  What makes you keep strapping them things on and getting after it?  Bonus questions - What is the best coffee shop in Portland and what is your favorite type (growing region/roast) of coffee?
rollerblading,2up8dc,grayfox1840,5,Wed Feb 11 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Yooooooooooo! Hope to see you and Atlanta soon. The best part is how fun it is. I've been doing frontsides for 21 years and they're still fun! I can go to a skatepark, skate by myself and have fun and leave happy. I need skating. I think making new things like parts and working with cool people on projects makes you go out and get it. And you can't forget the indescribable feeling after you get a clip you really like. My favorite shop here is Water Aveune, and I'm a sucker for the Ethiopa Yirgacheffe region."

rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,5,Thu Feb 12 09:58:17 2015 UTC,Man. You just have to keep doing it. Like they say practice really does make perfect. I still get scared of tricks. You just have to be confident. Jjust master the basics first and be comfortable on your skates. Have fun.
rollerblading,2up8dc,B-ace,9,Sat Feb 14 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"you ate it on a roy in Noir, Voodoo Show, and The Lost Tapes. sup with that? were the landed versions of those tricks done after all of those bails? or were you going back to perfect it when you bailed and ended up being like ""fuggit, use the first clip!""?  with that being said, how often do you find yourself redoing tricks to make them look perfect (to you)?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,7,Thu Feb 12 16:04:09 2015 UTC,"They were all landed after the falls. Royales are one of those tricks, it's a fundamental one. Sometimes you over do it or focus on the wrong aspect cause hey ""it's just a royale"" ya know? I redo tricks quite a bit, I'm very picky. But there's nothing better than getting that one 1st try."
rollerblading,2up8dc,k2rolla503,7,Sat Feb 14 02:32:18 2015 UTC,"In the past, there where lots of pro tours where the pro skaters had sessions/meet ups with local kids (promoted with flyers and stuff). Nowadays it seems pro's show up at contests, do their thing and before and afterwards only session with their own little crew to get clips. Don't you think it would be great for your fans to give them this change? Why is this not happening anymore?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,8,Fri Feb 13 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"There aren't skate shops, events or skaters making that happen. Nowadays if you want things like that happening you gotta go out and make it happen. Put events together like Blading Cup and Pow Wow. It would be great, we need more of it. But truthfully most times after you skate a contest all you want to do is go take a shower, skating in a contest is intense."

Can you easily swap between the two when you want, or do you have a preference for one over the other?   As for frames, you have been riding the Create Original custom graphic frame for a long time now, so will you be riding the new suspension frames, or stick with what you know?  Lastly, do you keep a copy of all of your pro-model products, or do you use/give away everything when you are finished with it? Where do your used skates go?  Thanks!"

It takes a few sessions to feel normal if I go back and forth from the 13 to the skinned skate. Right now I prefer the v13. I plan on skating both the CRS and the regular frame. I unfortunalty don't keep all my product, wish I had 1 of everything. Not really sure where it all goes. I keep stuff for awhile so I have extra if I need it. But I give my friends stuff if they're really needing it."

For young kids that dream of making it to your level, what kinds of things should they avoid (smoking, alcohol, processed cheese, etc.) and what kinds of good habits should they start at a young age (stretching, etc.)?   Thanks, and can't wait for your next edit, section, or presence at a skate comp."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,6,Sat Feb 14 03:05:24 2015 UTC,"Hey Krans! I'd say the most important thing is finding out what works for you. Obvisouly stretching is great, I should do it more. But just stay fit and be active. And really nothing can do more for you than just skating. Skate everyday or as much as you can, that's where you'll find the most benefit. Or start playing ice hockey.  See ya soon, dude."

rollerblading,2up8dc,meparadis,3,Sat Feb 14 03:19:23 2015 UTC,We were tired of shit wheels and wanted to do our own thing. Having complete control over something is always the inspiration to start your own thing. Soon we'll not only have product but we'll have a really really good product. Not just a run of the mill wheel like most people are trying to sell you now. It will be sick.
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,3,Fri Feb 13 14:13:30 2015 UTC,I'm also 28 years old and all though I stopped skating a while back I try to keep up with the industry news. Your original KFC section was one of my favorites. * What happened the the industry the past five years? Why has there been such a decline? *Who are your current sponsors? How much do you make from skating from your sponsors (not counting contest wins)?
rollerblading,2up8dc,B-ace,5,Sat Feb 14 03:23:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks. People stopped skating and stopped buying products, simple as that. I skate for Valo, Vibralux Denim, Create, DEAD wheels, Thee Strange and Aggressive Mall. I'm not making $kateboard money, that's for sure."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,3,Thu Feb 12 03:34:00 2015 UTC,Do you prefer rollerblading to be underground and practiced by true lovers of the sports or you'd rather see it become popular and mainstream (more money for the companies and the riders) ?
rollerblading,2up8dc,LeKicks,6,Sat Feb 14 03:38:35 2015 UTC,"Ups and downs on both sides. I'd just love to see it reconigized and respected and the industry flourishing. Just imagine what we could do if we had more money, pretty crazy to think about."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,3,Fri Feb 13 13:37:00 2015 UTC,"Hi Alex, I think you're an incredible blader. Your abilities are almost beyond comprehension for a mere mortal like myself.   Blading does take a toll on your body. How do you feel physically at the moment? For how long do you think you can continue to blade at this level? And at what point in your physical decay (we all have to face this at one point) would you consider to 'retire' as pro?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,B-ace,3,Sat Feb 14 03:42:32 2015 UTC,"I feel great, possibly even the best I've felt. Some days you're more sore than others but that's life. I plan on going as long as I can and the industry allows it."

This question is pretty forward, but very interesting to a lot of people; how much money do you make? Could you elaborate how much you make per sponsor/business venture?  This information would give great insight in our industry and its status. And might even push people to support more in terms of buying VOD's, gear etc.  Thanks a lot!"

rollerblading,2up8dc,tupeloms,5,Sat Feb 14 03:58:32 2015 UTC,They are two totally different tricks. Savannah is a 270.

rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,5,Fri Feb 13 17:10:59 2015 UTC,more like yup
rollerblading,2up8dc,arnoldpalmerlemonade,6,Fri Feb 13 17:24:44 2015 UTC,Actually 100% what Travis said. Ally-oop unity is a unity going backwards and a savannah is a 270 into a backside ally-oop unity. I've been skating since before either of those were tricks.

Like where your weight should be..placement of your grabbed foot(is it parallel to your backslide foot or is it slightly over what your grinding) and in the v13s specifically..are you locked in with your toes slightly forward or just regular? Ive been skating for 16 years and still dont have this one down and it drives me insane!"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,3,Sat Feb 14 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm, have your knee above the foot that is grinding to balance out your weight. Shoulders parrellel and head forward. I really don't know what my toes are doing, let's say they're regular. It's a bit different in the v13 since the backslide is deeper but once you get it. Man, it's so good!"
rollerblading,2up8dc,Private_Stock,2,Fri Feb 13 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"Hi Alex,  Thank you for doing this AMA.  You have been a long time professional blader, what will you do ""post blading""?  Would you continue pushing blading as a company owner or something along those lines, or move on with another passion in your life?    Of all the new up and coming skaters, who do you like to watch skate and why?   Again thanks for taking some questions, welcome the PNW, and hope you make to this year's NWST in June."
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,3,Sat Feb 14 04:08:56 2015 UTC,"Staying inside of skating would be the best if that's a possibility of course.

rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,2,Sat Feb 14 04:17:02 2015 UTC,"I've been skating long enough to know what I like. You can always improve. I need to get more comfortable on a few switch tricks, haven't done many lately. Haven't done many 720s at all forward or backwards. Should try and do more. Who knows. I don't plan stuff out like that, I just skate, have fun and see what happens."

rollerblading,2up8dc,B-ace,3,Thu Feb 12 21:12:54 2015 UTC,"Hey Alex, thanks for taking the time to have a chat and answer some of our questions.  Just a single question from me.  What do you think could bring inline back into the spotlight?  I'm a 31 year old returning skater after a 13ish year break and was blown away to find I'm the only person on blades at the skateparks in my town (though I do hear there is a few around, I am yet to see any of them).  Apart from generally just being nice to people and shredding well what do you think we can do as a community to get more people onto (or back onto) skates and build the scene back up to what it used to be?  Or are we now destined to be the weird guys at the skatepark forever!"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,3,Sat Feb 14 04:23:57 2015 UTC,The weird guys just need to get unweird haha. I don't know dude. The only thing we can do is keep skating and hopefully people notice and want to skate. We just need more people on skates. Seems simple.
rollerblading,2up8dc,Vader1982,2,Sat Feb 14 04:56:53 2015 UTC,"Why do your ride VALO? Is this really the skate you like or are there other reason you can't name. I think VALO hasn't been innovative the last years and did just only things in marketing. Ist just now the old skate again without the skin. If you like them fine, but why not XSJADO or an USD Carbon?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,TBGruel,6,Sun Feb 15 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"Valo is the best company in our industry. Jon puts back into our industry not takes away like most other brands. Jon cares about skating not just his company. If there was money to be innovative we would be innovating. We already have a carbon skate. We have a normal skate and we have a classic skate. The original skate. But yes, Valo skates are the best. Easily. And everyone's had the same skates for years now, come on man."

rollerblading,2up8dc,Nidty719,7,Sat Feb 14 04:26:01 2015 UTC,"That's all been worked out a long time ago. No need to talk about it now. Sean and I are good, actually talking to him right now."

Things have certainly changed over the last few years: the shift has gone from big tricks to stylish tricks.  Do you see a place in the future of aggressive skating for powerblading?  Do you think that the two can co-exist?  You mention that you aren't personally interested in larger frames and bigger wheels, but do you think you might ever change your mind?  If so, why not?"
rollerblading,2up8dc,AlexanderBroskow,1 point,Fri Feb 13 14:33:35 2015 UTC,"Hey Alexander, sorry for the extra question if I'm allowed to throw in another but I thought of what you said about ""powerblading"" having a silly name, and would like to ask what you as a pro think of the name ""aggressive inline skating."" Sometimes I'm really amazed that these names stuck, do you really introduce yourself and the sport to strangers as ""aggressive inline skating""? Seems like a ridiculous mouthful."

rollerblading,2uqmw0,ultimomono,1 point,Sat Feb 7 00:05:18 2015 UTC,"If not, maybe you could have your skates shipped to your dad's hotel so they are waiting for him when he gets there. If it's a decent hotel, they should be able to do that for him if he lets them know ahead of time.   Those are very, very nice skates. I love my Seba skates (FR1 80). They are seriously my favorite possession and bring me ridiculous amounts of ujoy and have lasted for years despite the beating I give them. I'm not sure how the fit is the SX, but I had to get mine one size up. Talk to the folks wherever you buy to make sure you get the right size. If it's like their other models, one boot can be three different sizes depending on the liner, so you want to order strategically, so you could swap out the liner just in case they are too small/big."
rollerblading,2uqmw0,unspeakable_horror,1 point,Sat Feb 7 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Hi - as an ex-skater in NYC, sadly there are not great stores for inline skates, certainly not the kind of selection you can find online.  That being said, Paragon Sports near Union Square (on Broadway) at least had some models you can try on (go downstairs in the back).  There are some good hockey and inline stores in NJ and upstate NY, but that's traveling outside of NYC.  There is also Westside Skate and Stick on Fifth Ave just below 23rd St.  I don't recall them having much skate selection, but I often used them for maintenance on my inline skates (new wheels, cleaning bearings, etc); their main focus though is ice, FYI.  Feel free to ask me NYC questions."

rollerblading,2uq3hp,Sonox,3,Wed Feb 4 07:40:04 2015 UTC,i really like the Rollerblade Twister 80 personally... You can't go wrong with them :)
rollerblading,2uq3hp,PROFESSIONAL_FART,2,Wed Feb 4 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"If you're upgrading to an urban style skate you might as well consider going brakeless. There's no such thing as a good brake they're all pretty useless. T-stops, hockey stops and powerslides are much more effective. That's why you'll see most intermediate and advanced skaters opting not to use a brake, and I usually recommend that even beginners learn to stop relying on a heel brake as early as possible. It saves you from developing some bad skating habits.  Here's some great urban skates to consider:  Rollerblade Twister 80: Brake not shown in pictures, but comes in the box.  Rollerblade Maxxum 84: Brake comes attached with extra axle in the box for removal.  Seba GTX84: brake attached.  Seba FRX80: No brake.  Seba FR2 80: no brake - sold separately"
rollerblading,2uq3hp,ScoopJr,3,Wed Feb 4 05:38:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for those recommendations, I will check them out.  I really need a brake, I have a highly trained rollerblade dog that loves to run."

rollerblading,2uo04h,olskeevi,2,Tue Feb 3 20:25:27 2015 UTC,no soul plate or maybe it's the 100mm wheels but those wheel slides are quite interdasting
rollerblading,2unejz,Otroletravaladna,4,Tue Feb 3 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"For neiborhood cruising you're looking at 80mm. Anything larger is probably too much (more speed, yes, but also longer frames and, thus, less maneuverable skates, you'll also be standing 26-30mm higher, which CAN feel awkward at first.)  Given the wheels you need are 26mm larger than your 54mm... ( /r/theydidthemath ), you will have to fit a new frame: There's simply no room in your current frames for bigger wheels (think in wheel to wheel distance and wheel to boot distance).  I'd get a flat 80mm UFS powerblading frame. But have in mind that switching frames too often can have a toll on your boots' frame fixing point (and it can be cumbersome).   If you have the budget, I'd recommend buying a separate pair of freeskate-style skates (Check Rollerblade twisters or SEBA FRX/FR2/FR1) and enjoy going out for a skate without having to swich frames every time you feel like changing styles :)  Last: check these magnificent bastards :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnDte5GSS4g"
rollerblading,2unejz,chowaniec,2,Tue Feb 3 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"For cruising you ideally want 72+ mm wheels, flat. So you could spend ~$150 on a powerblade setup, or you could spend ~$150 on some decent rec skates. You probably can't go bigger than 58 mm in your current frames."
rollerblading,2unejz,ScoopJr,2,Tue Feb 3 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"I am not entirely sure.  But i think it largely depends on the type of frame and how big of wheels they support.  So if you were able to find a different frame that supports bigger wheels that would work!    If you're looking for outside smooth rolling wheels, its usually the bigger they are the smoother the roll.  I usually run 84-80mm wheels with a 85a hardness.  I am sure anything above 70+ would be great for outdoors as long as the wheel has a hardness above 80a.  Edit : Running 84-80mm wheels outside for me is a breeze.  Everything is smooth sailing and i can literally roll over anything and be good."
rollerblading,2unejz,olskeevi,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:42:13 2015 UTC,Depending on good big you want to go you may want to consider bigger frames. This is a good deal with good wheels. http://rollerwarehouse.com/Ground-Control-Big-Circolo-Frame-Kit.asp

When submitting to iTunes, check that there are no podcasts with a very similar name.  If you just want to get going and put up some MP3s, that's fine, you can sort all this out later.

If the laces sit on the top of your foot, consider loosening them up a bit. From what I gather only the cuff and ankle straps matter?"
rollerblading,2uij5j,riox,3,Mon Feb 2 17:36:03 2015 UTC,I'm inclined to believe that riox is correct in assuming your skates are way too tight.
rollerblading,2uij5j,arnoldpalmerlemonade,3,Mon Feb 2 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"I have to wear foot inserts in my shoes, I believe they are called orthodics. I don't wear these in my skates, and my feet hurt incredibly bad in a shorter time than if I don't wear them in my shoes. I believe I have flat feet but I don't know for sure. Saw a podiatrist to get these foot inserts. I couldn't even jog before, now I run 3 5k's a week. You might want to look into this. I'm not a doctor, but your feet may be experiencing pain from a lack of support in a very specific place, and therefore need some support. This was pretty much my case. If you don't have the proper access to healthcare to look into this, my ex used the Dr. Scholls machine in a walmart, got some foot inserts that were built similar to my professional grade ones, and is now more comfortable walking long distances. Just something to think about."
rollerblading,2uij5j,365billionwaffles,2,Mon Feb 2 17:57:23 2015 UTC,"I find that the laces in that area don't do me much good, anyway. I always keep them pretty loose, mainly for the reason of avoiding foot numbness, about so much that I can slide my finger under there."

(I.E , Removing Liner and just lacing up and seeing if that helps or not lacing up at all, changing the soles of your boot, adjusting the way you do the straps on the skate.)"
rollerblading,2uij5j,ScoopJr,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:55:00 2015 UTC,What skates are you on?  My Roces M12 used to give me a bunch of pain in that instep area until i changed to more comfortable liners (Spec ops Trust) and I also stopped overtightening that area.

I do not even tighten the laces, just tuck them at the sides. I only tihhten buckle strap, and that is loose.

rollerblading,2u641j,what_is_this_life,2,Fri Jan 30 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, awesome edit. ""True ao unity to true ao unity"" is a little deceiving. It makes it sound like it was a switch up rather than doing it twice in a row. Sick either way. Everything in the edit was amazing. I felt an almost teary-eyed bursting of joy watching Haffey kill it again. ""Street mega ramps"" is an awesome way to put it."
rollerblading,2u641j,Tromance,2,Fri Jan 30 22:56:09 2015 UTC,"I left it ambiguous to not spoil anything. But I will say it's one of two tricks I had to double take to make sure I saw it correctly. No one is doing lines of the same tricks, same spin, same foot almost ever. I was super impressed at that. And I have a feeling that it will be one of those ""oh Haffey/farmer/Broskow can do that and it legit to repeat tricks?!?, I can now too"" moments and define tricks for a while to come. Just like when farm made negs cool again, and Alex brought back toe rolls."

rollerblading,2u4t81,ScoopJr,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:50:00 2015 UTC,Mmmm Seba FR2's  So weird seeing a used pair with what looks like the original Seba wheels.   BTW: why have you kept the black laces in?  I akways either ditch them or put in some coloured ones. Other than aesthetics they've never made an impact on the Seba FR series when I've ridden them.
rollerblading,2u4t81,AlxxS,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:42:54 2015 UTC,Original wheels getting replaced on saturday as well. Bearings aren't in the greatest condition so the wheels will be replaced along with them.    Actually i don't really know.  I didn't mind having the black laces so i just didn't replace them.  Even if i wanted to though i would want to find some quality laces.  One lace has lost the plastic tip and i had to cut it twice and use something to stick the lace in the hole.

rollerblading,2u3hj2,ghatid,2,Thu Jan 29 16:58:19 2015 UTC,Not entirely sure about the inside of the skate.  You can try changing the liner.  Also check the bearings and see what kind of condition their in.  You can always rotate your wheels as well.  Welcome to the club!
rollerblading,2u3hj2,ScoopJr,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"The bearings are amazing. They just keep going. I need to replace the wheels, but I'll get on that when I get more into it...  Which wheels should be in the best shape? I'm thinking the front and back ones?  There's...no liner just a sole in this pair of skates."
rollerblading,2u3hj2,ScoopJr,2,Thu Jan 29 23:32:25 2015 UTC,I think it just depends for the wheels.  My front wheels need to be rotated the most.  Put your best two wheels in the front/back and your worst two wheels in the middle.

The only time this wouldn't work is if your hockey skates happen to have a hi-lo set up; two small wheels in the front with larger wheels in the back. In which case you would follow the same guide but only rotate the two front (R) for the to front (L) then the same for the back."

First hour I couldn't even get my foot in them, it was a bit painful, now I can stay 7 hours+ in them without pain. I have a wide feet as well and I absolutely love these skates."
rollerblading,2u3a4d,FizzxD,1 point,Fri Jan 30 01:21:28 2015 UTC,"DUDE yes. I just bought some FR1s that I was so frustrated trying to even get on. I was in so much pain for about ~5 minutes. After 2 rolls in them they're pretty easy to get on, and fairly comfy. These are going to fit like a glove after a few more rides."
rollerblading,2u3a4d,jdowpcs,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, FR1 has the same boot and liner, so it's the same situation. I absolutely love these skates. As you said, they fit like a glove and no pain at all, even after many hours, it's just a matter of overtraining."
rollerblading,2u3a4d,FizzxD,-1,Mon Feb 2 00:25:18 2015 UTC,"Valo carbon boots, or xsjado are wide. You may not find them in that price range"
rollerblading,2u3a4d,furrdogg,-1,Thu Jan 29 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"For your price range, your best bet would probably be to try on pairs that are a size or two larger than your foot size. Many brands also allow you to get custom boots made from your own foot molds, but those additions are often a bit pricier."
rollerblading,2u3a4d,citan_uzuki,2,Thu Jan 29 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"If my size for a shoe is 12.5,  does that mean the skate would be 12.5 too?"
rollerblading,2u3a4d,citan_uzuki,2,Thu Jan 29 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"Skates are usually on the tight side so if you get your exact size, you may find it waaaaaay too tight. I have wide feet as well (not as wide as yours), but it took me quite awhile to find a pair of skates that weren't unbearably tight.  Generally, though, look for skates with laces or something similar which will allow you to loosen up the skates to accommodate your foot width. The kind with just latches may not be worth it for you.  Here's a handy little page which gives measuring guides depending on the brand of skates you go with. Maybe you could give this a go and see if you find a brand/size that'll fit your feet?"
rollerblading,2u3a4d,Morbidgrass,-1,Thu Jan 29 18:57:40 2015 UTC,I thought the razors genesys were known for being wide.
rollerblading,2u3a4d,AmsterdamBlader,-1,Thu Jan 29 18:59:50 2015 UTC,came here to say this. valo lights are wider as well but if you're a big guy i'd stay away as they have low cuffs and don't offer much support.
rollerblading,2u2lpe,AlfieCDZW,3,Thu Jan 29 11:34:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely, they're great skates for any skill level. I started skating around twenty years ago (not all that time on aggressives) but when it comes to my 'aggressive' skating preferences I've kept cult style boots on hand for 12-13 years. Any time I stray away to a different brand/model I end up going back. It's a classic and you won't find a better skate for the price."
rollerblading,2u2lpe,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Thu Jan 29 12:56:37 2015 UTC,Should I order them a size higher than my normal shoe size?
rollerblading,2u2lpe,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:42:26 2015 UTC,Would you say you have a wider foot? And what size do you wear exactly. The shell sizing could effect what one to buy.
rollerblading,2u2lpe,Hollow_Ling,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:30:12 2015 UTC,No I don't. I'm size 7
rollerblading,2u2lpe,Travis_Stewart,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:01:56 2015 UTC,I bought some Cults myself a few months ago from roller warehouse and on their site it said that the skates were a half a size small. So far too me it seems they were right. Also if you get the Cult Street Blue 2 just remember they are going to be really tight at first.
rollerblading,2u2lpe,ScoopJr,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:22:19 2015 UTC,OK thanks. How are they now for you? Did it take long to loosen them up?
rollerblading,2u2lpe,Hollow_Ling,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"So you being a size 7, the skate sizes are 5-7, 8-9, 10-11, and 12-13. If you buy an 8, your gonna have some extra room, and they might be a little bulky. If you buy a 7, you run the risk of out growing, or being to small. The cults will run you about 1/4 to 1/2 to small. So if you are a small 7, you'll be fine. If your still a sprouting vine and growing, snag the 8's."
rollerblading,2u2lpe,KidneyAttic,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:36:31 2015 UTC,If you know approx what your actual shoe size is.  Get something a little bigger.  You want some room rather then having your toes cramped. Its no bueno
rollerblading,2u2lpe,Neo_Viking,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"I haven't had the chance to actual give them really good use (Weather and College), but so far every time I put them on they're tight (Jug Liners are really well padded), but then they loosen up after a few minutes."

rollerblading,2u0tx6,forceez,3,Wed Jan 28 23:56:03 2015 UTC,"Good looking skates! In my opinion, the sack of potatoes feeling is pretty normal until you get a feel for the skates. I remember feeling like that when I first got back into it but not when I get new wheels. Just get used to cross overs and you'll forget about it. It could be an issue with leg strength, but that'll build in no time. Its possible that blades weight more than your hockey skates and they are nowhere near as fast as being on the ice. Enjoy them!  Edit: I remember your earlier post about transitioning"
rollerblading,2u0tx6,Jerm2113,2,Thu Jan 29 01:30:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate! It could very well be either or both, I'm transitioning to blading from ice skating/hockey. Didn't expect to feel like such a clown! 😁  Thank you, I will!"

rollerblading,2u0tx6,Hollow_Ling,3,Thu Jan 29 00:22:30 2015 UTC,"If you used to be able to skate well with recreational skates the sack of potatoes feel is from only having two wheels on the ground (your rockered setup). It will get better with time and practise (but for me never really went away, so I went back to a flat setup)."
rollerblading,2u0tx6,GreensandCaffeine,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:14:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Maybe it is because I used to be on the ice? :)"
rollerblading,2u0tx6,hifire,1 point,Thu Jan 29 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"If you do try a flat setup (all wheels the same size) I think you might feel a bit more at home with the turning and the speed, but grinding the h-block will be harder. So if you mainly wanna do aggressive inline stuff like grinding, try and get used to the rockered setup, otherwise maybe get four more wheels the same size as the outer ones."

rollerblading,2u1vsp,xHelios,2,Thu Jan 29 05:21:14 2015 UTC,"Check aggressive mall, roller warehouse, and inline warehouse for a variety of aggressive skates. Although because you want to use skates for transportation as well, I would recommend a flat set up. Currently I'm not sure what would be a good skate, but I'll start looking into it."
rollerblading,2u1vsp,Hollow_Ling,2,Thu Jan 29 06:35:16 2015 UTC,"Okay so the best I could come up with are Rollerblade New Jack 5s. My main reason behind this is that 1: the skates are about $179 2: I've heard they skate very well 3: They fit larger wheels in the skates 60mm is the size of the wheels that come with the skates. Now the cons are the obvious like the skates only are sold as an anti-rocker set up (so only 4 wheels in total), but you could just buy a new set of wheels for a full flat set up. If any other people here on reddit as any thoughts spit them out!"
rollerblading,2u1vsp,Hollow_Ling,2,Fri Jan 30 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"Twister 80s are great for freeskating and city skating, not so much for aggressive inlining and powerblading grinds. You can do jumps and certain tricks on the standard twisters but the frame wont hold an aggressive beating over a long time, for that you are better off with the Twister Pro (which is marginally more expensive but still doesnt allow for grinds) or the Fusion RB skates, which are a little more durable and more long the lines of a powerblade setup.  If your main use out of the skates (other than having fun) is getting about town, put your money down on Twisters (Or SEBAs in the same price range). Ive gone through about 3 different pairs of skates until I settled on the Twistes and for freeskating there is no skate that is more comfortable and better as an all-round performer. Perfect for learning to skate. Down the line, after you get the basics done, and you REALLY want to get into tricks you could consider investing in an aggressive pair."
rollerblading,2u1vsp,DranDran,2,Thu Jan 29 09:21:13 2015 UTC,"If you're on the east coast, hit up Long at Oakcityinline! If you cant find a PB setup with a price range you like you can always check the blade and trade page on facebook."
rollerblading,2u1vsp,Frostyblock,2,Thu Jan 29 16:27:56 2015 UTC,"First of all you do NOT have to spend $200 on a good pair of skates. Even skates for ~ $100 can be very decent.   I use the Rollerblade Twister 80 - They are mainly used for freestyle-slalom but u can gain speed really quickly without too much effort.  They are built pretty solid so jumping is no problem with them. They fit really well, are not too wide. Only annoying part about them is that the shoe is squeaking sometimes when driving. There is no brake installed, but will be delivered with the skate. So u can install the brake at the beginning and remove it when u feel more confident in skating.   Since u are a beginner I would recommend you watching This! video. :)  I hope i could be a little helpful :)"

I'd reccomend a skate like this for your purpose. It's got 84mm wheels (wheels range from 72mm-100mm, roughly) Generally speaking, the larger the wheel, the faster and more inertia you'll retain for speed. It includes a brake so you can brake that way if you wish, but I recommend throwing that thing out as soon as you feel comfortable and learning to T-stop or powerslide (youtube for how to do that.)   If you've got even more cash, a pair like these are of even higher quality.   I don't know any stores locally for you to stop in and try any on. However I can tell you both InlineWarehouse and ProSkatersPlace are great retailers and can answer any of your questions online."

rollerblading,2tsv5v,PROFESSIONAL_FART,5,Tue Jan 27 03:35:29 2015 UTC,"I haven't skated in over 11 years. I'm 30 years old now and a husband and soon to be father. I am an audio engineer and drummer. I rarely see anybody rollerblading anymore but when I do I want to pull my car over and watch. It makes me miss the social aspect of skating. Rollerblading is one of those things that puts people from different backgrounds together in a positive way. Rockers, hip hop kids, nerds, whatever. I feel too old to get back into skating. If I got hurt my wife would never let me hear the end of it. I would not be able to drum either so the benefit of me not skating is more important in life. All this said, rollerbladers are fucking rad. Keep skating as long as it is in you because one day you might be like me and only have drive by memories of those great times."
rollerblading,2tsv5v,crashbangnoises,4,Tue Jan 27 05:11:16 2015 UTC,"30's not to old buddy, I've just gotten back into it at 31 after a 10+ year break :)  Granted we don't bounce back as quickly as we used to but a good stretch and warmup before skating should solve most of your problems.  That being said I am not sure I can see myself doing some of the massive gaps that I used to as a teenager due to my old man brain that is worrying about being hurt."

Maybe a 'Product of the Podcast/week/month or something could be cool. Could focus on one thing (I know the BIG frames are getting a lot of attention atm!). - Skaters to keep an eye on! Skating obviously thrives on how much media is getting to us; the man on the street. There are some brilliant lesser known skaters out there I'm sure so it would be cool to hear some recommendations. -  Considering we are only in January, the first podcast could have a section on this years upcoming events; Winterclash etc. I know you guys are citizens of the US so if you need some of us UK/EU/Rest of World to put our heads together I'm sure we can! - Question time claps in a childish manner. People love hearing their questions read out and they will love it even more if they are helping them out. Take a few questions from the subreddit perhaps? - This might be too personal if this is targeted at a wider audience than the subreddit alone but if there are any meet ups or anything going on, be cool to hear about them via podcast. I think we did mentioned something on the subreddit before about having a meet up/event tab, perhaps this could be of use?  Other than that, looking forward to it!"

My preferred youtube subscription list is full of people doing/talking about cool stuffs in a casual manner. How often would there be casts uploaded? I'd really appreciate if you cover some ground on general skating for beginners, perhaps share some stories of when you guys first started, really go into the roots of how/where/when/who y'all started skating with. With the revision of the basics, it may ""help"" some intermediate/advanced skaters to look at skating explained from a different perspective as well. And as we go into further episodes of the podcasts, perhaps you guys can go deeper into the styles in which you primarily have experience in skating?"

rollerblading,2ttsuc,ikbennaomi,3,Tue Jan 27 10:09:47 2015 UTC,"Have you tried both of them on? I don't know that much about K2, but I do know that FILA skates tend to be quite wide (In my case, too wide, even for my already-wide feet).  For the kind of skating you might end up doing in Holland (you can't imagine how I envy you!), you might want to spend just a bit more and get a pair of Rollerblade Twister 80. My wife has them and they are absolutely great. They even come with a detacheable brake so you can start skating with a heel brake then move to more versatile braking techniques as you grow more confident (heel brake ends up being annoying).  If you are just starting, the difference between 80m and 84mm won't be that interesting to you, and honestly, unless you want to get into faster skating, you'll be more than fine with 80mm. I've managed to consistently reach and maintain +35Km/h (+21mph) on a flat 80mm setup, and I'm not the fittest guy ever."
rollerblading,2ttsuc,Otroletravaladna,1 point,Tue Jan 27 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response! I have bought the K2 rollerskates, but also looked for your suggestion. Maybe when i'm a little more experienced, i could buy the Rollerblade skates. Now I'm curious, how is skating in the UK?"
rollerblading,2ttsuc,Otroletravaladna,1 point,Tue Jan 27 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"how is skating in the UK?   I've moved here from Spain a year ago... In Madrid I would go skating several times per week. In the UK I've only been able to go out skating less than 10 times last year.  The problem here is that when it is not raining (IMO, rain here is not as bad as people tend to believe), the weather is still quite humid and asphalt takes a while to dry, also, moss can be quite a problem when turning/braking, and generally speaking the streets have quite rough asphalt.  I love living here, but I'd certainly like to find appropriate places to skate more often."
rollerblading,2ttsuc,unseemlycad,1 point,Tue Jan 27 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I am not familiar with these specific models but would certainly recommend K2 as a brand over Fila.   K2 have been making market leading skates since the mid nineties, they have a wealth of experience and expertise at their disposal and have created some of the most ground breaking innovations in skate design ever. Fila, although a quality product, can't really make such claims.   More importantly, they are no where nearly as commonly sold so replacement parts could be a pain and after a year or so of use that might be a problem. K2 on the other hand are top quality, will last and are sold everywhere so are easily repaired.  The difference between 80 and 84 is marginal frankly and although bigger is generally faster, 80mm wheels are way fast enough. You'll be flying around on those, so yeah... For me, I'd go K2 every time."
rollerblading,2ttsuc,unseemlycad,3,Tue Jan 27 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your opinion! I have followed your advice, and buyed the K2 skates :) ps. this was my first reddit post, so you are my official first respondent! yeah!"

rollerblading,2tnkjp,KidneyAttic,2,Mon Jan 26 19:04:53 2015 UTC,They look pretty damn nice! Could you explain the BIG frames to me? I'm not sure I know who they are aimed at! I'm assuming they are for aggressive skaters that want a bigger/4 wheeled set up?
rollerblading,2tnkjp,mindgame,2,Mon Jan 26 10:33:31 2015 UTC,"Ive been skating anti rocker with 58mm wheels for about 8-9 years. And since seeing 'powerblading' in videos and at nass etc it has always appealed to me. But I love doing grinds (no better feeling than a steezed out royale!) So when these came a long with the extended h-block they seemed perfect. I can now blast around the parks at speed with ease and with minor changes to the way I grind I still have all my grinds. With the frame being a lot taller you have to get a lot lower in your grinds to lock in the backslide plate. Perfect for what I want. Plus I think the frames look awesome! Tl:dr yeah, you're right for aggressive skaters who want a bigger wheel setup"
rollerblading,2tp0br,besuperhuman,2,Mon Jan 26 05:26:14 2015 UTC,"Hey man! I bought the USD Realm boot myself a few weeks ago. They fit me perfectly, ankle is stable and nothing moves or lifts.  If you haven't done this already:  The first thing you should do is measure your feet and see if you foot length actually is the boot's size. To do that, you can stand on a sheet of paper and mark heel and toes, or just stand on a tape measure directly. If the boot is actually too big, you should definitely exchange them. You may find that your feet are actually smaller than you thought. At least that's what happened to me my first time.  If the size is correct:  a) At least for my Realm, the liner is heat moldable – doing that may help some. But tbh, I doubt it'd do much for a loose heel.  b) Try a smaller size, anyway, I guess."
rollerblading,2tp0br,franzwithbenefits,2,Mon Jan 26 06:29:26 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for the reply! I measured my foot and it inspired me to trace it and cut it out to put in the boot so I wou be able to see if there was any room. There's tons! However after taking the liner out I saw that my foot fits exactly toe to heel. I tied up the laces super tight and pulled the cuff again. It fits better but since the left foot fits perfectly with no movement, I'll probably use thicker socks on the right. Maybe I'll try the heat molding as well. Thanks for your help!"
rollerblading,2tp0br,Dunescha,2,Tue Jan 27 05:43:55 2015 UTC,"There are definitely options for you try and get a better fit. Get a neutral (or pronated/supinated if applicable) in-sole from a supermarket, wear thicker socks, ensure the boots are properly and tightly laced.  As /u/franzwithbenefits suggested if you are willing to risk waiving warranty, you could see if you boot is heat mouldable and give that a try.   If you are a beginner skater, be aware that your sense of balance will change dramatically as you progress, and ankle flex will become less of an issue. As long as you are able to secure the heel and lower ankle, you might find these skates quite usable in the long run, particularly if you are <20 and may still be growing.  I'v found that my skates get more and more comfortable as continue wearing them and my skills improve.  Good luck with your decision!"
rollerblading,2to0dt,riox,2,Mon Jan 26 00:03:08 2015 UTC,"Concrete is hard.  Streets are usually not smooth concrete either.  Rinks are made of wood.  It's a more forgiving and smooth surface.  Keep skating, you'll build up your muscles and be able to skate farther."
rollerblading,2to0dt,LibAtheist,2,Mon Jan 26 05:21:49 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, thanks friend. Any recommendations for exercises for building skating muscles on my test days?"
rollerblading,2to0dt,dendord,1 point,Mon Jan 26 05:27:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is what you're asking about but what works for me is to walk as much as possible. Now, since I walk about 2km to school everyday, my legs feel pretty damn strong. Just ditch the car for a bit and walk! :D"
rollerblading,2to0dt,LibAtheist,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:15:18 2015 UTC,Yoga is pretty awesome for any sports that rely on balance and core strength.
rollerblading,2to0dt,gypsyblader,2,Mon Jan 26 18:32:35 2015 UTC,Hey theres a few other things I can think of that hasn't  been said. Wind can tire you out if you are skating against it. The sun can tire you out faster if its beating down on you for a while. You burn more calories and loose energy when its cold.  Slight inclines contrary to a flat surface will for sure wear you down. Hoped this helped.
rollerblading,2to0dt,chowaniec,2,Mon Jan 26 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Harder wheels might help a bit on concrete, but for the most part that's just how it is. The vibration you get on rough surfaces wastes a lot of energy."
rollerblading,2to0dt,soloroll,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"What size wheels do you use? Bigger wheels will help over rough surfaces. Use a harder rubber too. Im an aggressive skater recently moved up from 57mm to 72mm and the 20y/o tarmac in my street is suddenly smooth, I was astounded by the difference!"
rollerblading,2to0dt,soloroll,2,Mon Jan 26 13:21:24 2015 UTC,"As stated in OP I use 80mm wheels with 78a hardness. The wheel size is already maxed out for my frames, but I know nothing about hardness or which hardness is recommended for urban skating"
rollerblading,2to0dt,soloroll,1 point,Mon Jan 26 14:40:43 2015 UTC,"i apologize i missed that bit. 78a is a very soft wheel, great for perfectly smooth surfaces but not so great outdoors. May be worth trying a harder wheel. the higher the A rating the harder the rubber. (so an 84a is harder than a 78a)"
rollerblading,2to0dt,LibAtheist,2,Mon Jan 26 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I don't think I'll buy new wheels any time soon since I'm short on cash and would like to wear down my wheels before replacing them. Any tips on controlling speed without looking like a danger to society? I'm not by any means super experienced, but indoors I have no trouble doing cross overs and simple skate techniques. The only time I struggle with speed is on the street or sidewalk. Also are there any balance exercises I should be doing?"
rollerblading,2to0dt,ScoopJr,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"I come from an aggressive background, so for me most of the time I have a ramp I can use to stop on, so it may be worth getting secondary advice from someone who street/rec skates more. However, I know a couple of ways. theres always T stopping, where you put your weight on your strongest/comfortable foot and drag the other skate sideways to use as a brake. I dont like doing this though as it can flatspot your wheels. If you have a lot of space you can slalom and lean into to the turns and dig your wheels in so to speak, like a skier would. I would practice these techniques somewhere you have plenty of space to stop naturally. :)"
rollerblading,2to0dt,megadavegg,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:50:37 2015 UTC,"Any background in skiing?  You can use ""edging"" techniques to stop.  T stops will work too, but they will tear up your wheels."

rollerblading,2to4fr,hifire,2,Mon Jan 26 03:46:17 2015 UTC,"That's a good question haha. I tend to skate alone which works for me but when I was chatting to the guys who own the big indoor park by my place they said they get about 15-20 inline guys on a wednesday night but I want to get my confidence back up before I head to that.    All I've seen at the skateparks is scooters, scooters and more scooters :P  with the very occasional skateboarder thrown in."
rollerblading,2to4fr,hifire,2,Mon Jan 26 04:12:37 2015 UTC,"Damn, that gathering sounds pretty cool, you should definitely head to it when you can!

rollerblading,2to4fr,hifire,2,Mon Jan 26 05:01:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely will, I'm a returning skater after a massive break (over 10 years), although skating instantly felt natural when I got back on them I'm a lot more hesitant when it comes to committing to grinds/airs. I'm sure that will fade as my confidence gets back up.    I definitely need to work on my leg strength though, after a few hours this morning my legs feel like jelly haha"

rollerblading,2to4fr,dendord,2,Mon Jan 26 09:35:31 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a good idea. Kids are going back to school soon, as well!  I've ordered my skates and should hopefully get them within the week.  Very keen to get started. Also, it's pouring on the east coast !"
rollerblading,2to4fr,greenstainedbrain,2,Wed Jan 28 02:54:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I have the day off tomorrow so I'll be spending the day at the indoor Park I think. Hopefully I'll have the place to myself!   The constant rain isn't helping outdoor sessions though
rollerblading,2to4fr,bladedvox,3,Wed Jan 28 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"For real, dude. I think my skates arrive tomorrow. Guy from Bayside skates just called me a model I wanted is out of stock, so they gave me a free upgrade to the Razor Genesys Reds :D"
rollerblading,2to4fr,greenstainedbrain,3,Wed Jan 28 04:00:21 2015 UTC,"+1 on the cults. If you can still get a pair maybe the RB Solo.  Aggressive skates CAN be comfortable. Experiment with liners and cuffs if you find them uncomfortable.  As for recreational distances, you will definitely have to work harder than on a freeskate/rec setup but if your skates are comfy and you're not doing 6 mile trips on a regular basis in them you should be good. I used to occasionally skate to the next town over via a rec trail on a freestyle aggressive setup- 6 linear miles, probably like 7.5 real miles on the trail, plus a mile or 2 into the town itself, 45 minutes flat, and that was before I found my blading zen"
rollerblading,2to4fr,bladedvox,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"Nice! Were those distances in aggressive skates? I'll definitely keep those two in mind, anything else that could be alternatives?

rollerblading,2to4fr,KidneyAttic,2,Tue Jan 27 23:28:06 2015 UTC,Assuming the TRS boot you are moving the skin onto has removable skins/midsouls as well. Also worth noting that the NJ3 and 4 do not have removable skins/midsouls.

Also, skates are a bit more expensive in my country, so I'd preferably possibly fork out a little bit more cash and make this investment in skating a one time payment for skates (not including any fixes/upgrades that may come along)"

I'd suggest looking long and hard for gaps in the blading industry and what you can do to turn a profit on it. I think it might be difficult to break into the industry though, as there's not as much money in it as in past years. Thinking about a previous post, you could start a really kickass podcast and look for industry sponsors as add revenue.  Probably The best thing you could do to support the community would be creating a non-profit that interacts with local governments and serves as a contractor building skateparks in poor neighborhoods, although you might have to get creative for grants/funding sources..."

Uncompleted tricks, swapping to new ones, swapping back, and back, and back...I've never seen someone butcher a skate section quite that badly, minus that retarded Jon Bolino section with the screaming feedback noises in the background that dropped like a week ago. Franky killed it (sadly, it's not impressing me like it used to though), but fuck that editing was bad. I understand freedom of expression and doing something new, but every edit I've seen him produce equally sucks. Woo, you have a camera that does 240+ FPS. Just because you have the equipment, doesn't make you an editor. Look at Brazillionare. He came in with some hot shit equipment, bumped myself, Hawke Trackler, and Kenny Owens out of the Razors work force for making what would become Game Theory, and bounced with his pocket full to become a ""motivational speaker"" with Burn the Boats. The guy is a fucking joke. But it's the same shit. Everyone is on his dick because he's got the gear, and they get free shit from him, but he's a talentless fuck at documenting blading. This guy who edited this seems to follow the same vein. His editing is nothing more then over done hype, timed to a really bad trap song with a hook, and he clicked the ""enable seizure"" button to set it off. This is by far and away the first section that if I payed for it, I'd demand a refund, and swear off VOD's forever. Beginning to end, it was bad. That's just the editing end of it. Don't get me started on compositioning, post production and color matching, grain (so much fucking random grain in every shot), blown out highs, no balance in the lows. It was just bad. It's Franky. I watched it. All of it. Still stand my ground that it was unwatchable."

I guess that makes me a casual because honestly I really liked it. The quick flashes the music and of course Franky himself all made me want to get up and skate. When an edit makes me feel so confident, to the point where I think I could go out and land that trick I've been working on or something new, that's what I think makes a good edit. Seriously though, you got a good argument against it and were able to express that without coming off like an asshole. Thats why I love this subreddit.

And while i don't wanna come off as arrogant, film/video is my background, and i take it very personally, both as an establishment and as a personal perfectionist. You can't make something you've invested this much time into a shiny turd, because its just a turd with some shine on it. Maybe as a one trick pony making this type of edit is acceptable, but the last three i've seen from him, and now this one, are identical. Insane amounts of ill timed slow motion, beat matching things that aren't there, using a song that no one has heard of for the sole fact that ""you're exclusive like that"". It just points to a dude with a lot of time and flashy gear. A great videographer can make something from a shit camera look absolutely stunning. A shitty videographer can take a great piece of equipment and make it look subpar. There is no reason for the stuff that he was shooting with (Just gonna take a stab and say based on the colors and grain, and FPS's, likely a Canon C30 DSLR style camera?) should look as poorly as it does. Same reason so many people still shoot with VX2100's and VX1000's. But there are a ton of shitty people with those cameras, and VHS cameras, and other bunk stuff that ruin the art behind it.  Thanks for listening to what i ad to say and not just down voting it and moving on. Thats why i love this place too. Just because it's not my cup of tea means you have to like it any less. :)"

rollerblading,2sy024,Largesaurus,2,Tue Jan 20 09:57:21 2015 UTC,"before anything that may be seen as a rant: cheers! nice to see a fellow skater rolling with big wheels!    a comment from a guy that rides 100mm+ in rough urban environments for a long time.  my current 100mm setup as an example: Imgur  all my main setups are big wheels (4x 100mm high cuff daily and 3x 125mm low cuff for long distances) but the 100mm+ setups have this huge problem with tricks in the wheel department:  the polyurethane debonding with the core on the wheels, that cause the squeaky noise when you put big pressure on the wheels (i can record a video with live demonstration if needed for further explanation)  the short version for the explanation is: if you do big falls (1m+ in height) with your ""plastic core"" + polyuretane wheels"", they will live a very short (healthy) life.  how is working for you joey? to me the last 3 sets of wheels i did that got ""f*ck up"" in a day. (squeaky noise and lowered performance under high speed)  -> yes, its not the bearings or the axle, i can assure you that. (think of a guy that cleans each individual ball of each ceramic bearing with cotton swab)  -> but no, parallel slides with 100mm wheels at high speeds are a unique experience that pretty much is worth how much the wheels cost. (spending 3 sets of wheels a year in average)  -> this is not a bad criticism in any way, i just think the aggressive wheels are just ""the polyurethane + bearings"" for this reason. (and usually very tiny too), the plastic core has the tendency to deform less than the polyurethane in hard impacts causing the unwanted debonding."
rollerblading,2sy024,aruametello,1 point,Tue Jan 20 04:23:58 2015 UTC,They use a metal core scooter 100mm wheels in their other 100mm set up i think :o
rollerblading,2sy024,Zephyrlot,1 point,Tue Jan 20 14:41:46 2015 UTC,I have yet to break hydrogens and I've been pretty rough on them so far.  I'm 184 pounds so I dunno if that's lighter than you or not.  I have some scooter wheels as wheel which you can really abuse but the urethane isn't as good.  I'm really hoping Leon makes a 110 for me so I can start using the really high end scooter wheels as they can take a lot of abuse.  But the hydrogens are the best so far.  We'll see how they fare over abuse in the Spring/Summer.
rollerblading,2sy024,Zephyrlot,1 point,Tue Jan 20 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"i weight only 136lbs, actually there is a set of wheels (super cheap brandless made for scooters) that didn't had the debonding problem. (although i didn't used them much because they are way too soft to be useful)  so yeah, i will test some other available brands. (import taxes are insane here in brazil so i mostly got to work with what i have nearby)"
rollerblading,2sy024,Warkid1993,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, if you also do tricks(or anything) on 100mm's I'm sure people would like to see it! There's a very disproportionate amount of big wheel content coming through here."
rollerblading,2sy024,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"true, my main problems is that there is so much few people into this that most of the time i wouldnt have anyone to hold the camera!  anyway its nothing exactly worthy of videos (i think), i can jump from flat ground obstacles a little over my waistline and i mostly put my skates to do the speeding stuff (like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wL8I9VRYlM)  i made a front flip (although not all that clean, and just once), so yeah, maybe a video someday."
rollerblading,2sy024,austincrewtoe,3,Wed Jan 21 15:08:37 2015 UTC,"Hey joey, I've had some 100mm wheels for a while, and as much as I'd like to do tricks in them, I find they grip just too hard, so I had some questions for you.  Is turning as easy in those as it looks? Whenever I get mine on it feels pretty much impossible to do anything with the turning radius you've shown here.  Are you just putting an obscene amount of force into the frames and ""forcing"" them to turn? Or is it getting up on one wheel for just long enough?"
rollerblading,2sy024,forceez,3,Tue Jan 20 01:27:53 2015 UTC,It's because of the rocker built into the wizard frame.  There's a curve to the placement of the wheels where it feels like perfectly worn in old wheels but you have brand new wheels in.  Has the turn feel of a much shorter frame but the stability of a long frame.  Skiing has rocker on long ass planks why not have it on long ass frames?

rollerblading,2swqyp,Clipto4818,3,Mon Jan 19 06:00:12 2015 UTC,From what I gather it doesn't really matter too much as long as they are tough. The GC featherlight 3 come with their hard plastic antis installed but I understand they get noisey after a while.   Most people tend to say pick what you like the look of as they last forever.
rollerblading,2swqyp,hifire,2,Mon Jan 19 08:08:56 2015 UTC,"For the frames, COs would be cool if you like to switch up your setup but if you stick with anti, go with FLT3 cause they can fit 60+mm wheels and have a more anti-style groove.  Def go for urethane - they don't crack or clack and the slide is similar to the uhmw ones, and yeah they will outlast at least 2 pairs of frames - I have a set of generic purple 44mm/101a for when I occasionally feel like skating anti and they have lasted through 2 months each of myself and my friend learning the basic tricks on an anti setup, plus some hardy street blading since I got them back."
rollerblading,2swqyp,bladedvox,2,Mon Jan 19 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"They're both good options. I would also consider the Kizer Fluid4's, they're a good simple antirocker frame with a nice wide h-block and a more ""flowy"" groove shape- a little shallower and wider than the other two. The Creates will have the narrowest groove, then the FLT's, then the Fluids. None of these shapes are better or worse than the others, it's just preference. Some like a narrower, deeper groove for a really locked-in feel, some like a shallower, wider groove for a surfier feel.  As for anti's, again that depends on your preferences. The plastic GC antis are light and slide well, but start rattling almost immediately. Urethane anti's will take bearings and thus will be silent and roll well, but will NOT slide nearly as nicely. My personal favorite was a plastic antirocker that took bearings- like a Night/SWS anti, or the old 2nd Regime Plastiks."
rollerblading,2swqyp,aldolega,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:46:53 2015 UTC,Urethane anti's... will NOT slide nearly as nicely   I just started skating some 101A Valos and I think they actually slide really well. Don't really notice a difference from the Nylon GCs.

I use Seba FR1 for cones because it is accommodating for my wide foot/toes. Seba High is great. Seba skates come with optional heel pads that can raise your heel and make the cuff appear to be shorter and thus let you really flex while keeping you on your toes.   Other skates include RollerBabe Twisters, Seba Trix (Trix are nice if you prefer a super light and somewhat flexy skate in contrast to Seba High which is pretty damn rigid and heavy from what i hear), Powerslide Freestyle Doop, Powerslide Imperials( I'm not a fan of these, bleh ankle support and heel cupping.

A good middle ground would be to get a powerblade / big wheels setup. Pairing an aggressive boot with a frame like a kizer level 2, GC big, or Bake powerframe."
rollerblading,2srpfe,Vulgar_Slaughter,1 point,Sat Jan 17 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could pair up a few parts, do you think it would be a bad idea for me to get something with an Antirocker frame?"
rollerblading,2srpfe,Largesaurus,2,Sun Jan 18 17:13:14 2015 UTC,"If you're confident with your skating ability, then an anti-rocker frame shouldn't be too much of a problem, you just have to get used to lifting your toes to make turns easier, but you get used to it quickly. The downsides would be that they're definitely not made for distance skating, so you better have built up some endurance if you want to take trips with them(don't). The wheels also wear down much faster when there's only two in contact with the ground, and your frames can still catch on transitions at the skatepark. But the upside is that they have a larger space for grinding obstacles. Detailed AMall explanatory video"
rollerblading,2srpfe,lDustDevil,3,Mon Jan 19 00:03:02 2015 UTC,The Twisters are great skates. Compact and speedy. I don´t know what agressive videos you´ve seen but with these skates you will have a hard time grinding. They don´t have soulplates (space around the frames with which you can grind over curbs or other obstacles) and these are neccessary if you plan to skate Agressive. But other than that everything else is doable with these badboys.
rollerblading,2srpfe,Largesaurus,0,Sat Jan 17 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"Most of the videos I've seen are street skates, and mostly vert ramps. With these I wasn't necessarily thinking of doing grinds because they don't have soulplates, just because I'm not even sure If I'll be up for the task of taking on Aggressive Inline."
rollerblading,2srpfe,forceez,1 point,Sun Jan 18 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to do anything with Aggressive Inlines. I should just take it slow from the start and get good with things that are comfortable with me, then probably move onto things more crazy."
rollerblading,2srpfe,Largesaurus,2,Sun Jan 18 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"Who downvoted all of this kid's replies? If you have to be like that to an honest noob, then you better head back over to rollernews or pick up skateboarding."

rollerblading,2srpfe,Largesaurus,2,Mon Jan 26 00:54:57 2015 UTC,"Hey Yasuo, I've also picked up aggressive inline after doing rec skating and some roller hockey. You've got a couple of options for you if you're not sure about committing to doing grind tricks, there are some inline skates that have dual capacity for both big-wheeled recreational skating and aggressive inline. The most high-end would be the Seba CJ Wellsmore skates, which are the same boot as the Seba SX skates, just with a frame for grinding mounted on its UFS system. Obviously several hundred dollar carbon-fibre skates aren't recommended/necessary for newbies, but there are alternatives such as the Rollerblade fusion X3 which is pretty much a rec boot with UFS to fit frames for grinds(you can also purchase Rollerblade solo soul plates for the fusion skates). Most aggressive skates are built more for durability to withstand consistent abuse from the rider, so they're generally not as comfortable and more difficult to fit as well as a recreational skate, but if you don't mind that then you could buy a pair of aggressive skates and mount a UFS frame for 80mm wheels as others have already suggested if you don't feel like skating on the smaller wheels and frame. For further reference, you can search the sub for previous discussions on skates. The Rollerblade Twisters and Seba FR series have already been evaluated several times, here is a recent post about the rollerblade fusions. Lastly, if you have any more questions feel free to ask, because most people on this sub are very helpful and receptive and don't have a superiority complex towards new kids getting into skating.  Also check out the buyer's guide at the top of this sub, mods put effort into that and most people seem to overlook it(click ""reddit buyer's guide)."
rollerblading,2srpfe,ultimomono,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"I think the most optimal choice for me would be to purchase the Fusion X3's, as my budget would not permit me getting CJ Wellsmore skates, or the Seba SX skates. I'll also check out the buyer's guide I have to admit I missed it like anyone else would haha. Also I was wondering if these skates would be a somewhat better choice http://www.inlineskates.com/Bladerunner-Fury-Aggressive-Skates-2015/156188P,default,pd.html If I wanted to do some occasional tricks, grinds etc. Also If the maximum distance I was going to skate would be around 2 miles?"
rollerblading,2srpfe,ShaneTrain86,2,Sun Jan 18 23:49:19 2015 UTC,"Bladerunners are from Rollerblade, which is a good start since the general consensus is that you should buy your skates from a trusted brand rather than some knockoff, but I personally don't know how good these skates are. The frames seem to be a bit of a problem, they look heavy and have a h-block grind plate thing, somewhat of an anachronism in today's rollerblading world. Most people recommend frames from a dedicated frame manufacturer, some of the most common today would be Ground Control frames. If you're looking to travel around each session, then a flat setup would be good for that, but could hinder your grinding ability. One workaround would be Kaltik frames, which allow you to have all four wheels down, but extend further over the two centre wheels to prevent wheel bite. 92a is also probably one of the hardest ratings you could have for a wheel, so just know that it's less grippy than pretty much every other wheel out there, but they'll supposedly last longer. The cuffs/liners also look tall on those, but I'm not sure if it's exceptionally so since I don't have a way to cross-reference that, there are skates that work fine with tallish cuffs anyway. Other than that, they look nice and wide and a flat setup is best for rolling around. But I think you could find a pair that are more commonly recommended by the sub(refer to buyer's guide/search previous posts)."
rollerblading,2srpfe,Hollow_Ling,1 point,Mon Jan 19 00:10:16 2015 UTC,"I see, thanks for the in depth description, appreciate it haha. I've got a long ways to go on learning the basics and what's good or not for Aggressive Inline. I'll look around see if I can find a fair of some good Aggressive Inline's judging with the criteria you've just said about the Bladerunners. But in the end I'll probably end of in getting recreational ones, which could help me do some jumps and just are good for Inline in general. Thanks again for the help"

rollerblading,2s0nnt,Bau5_Sau5,3,Sun Jan 11 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"You can go up to 60mm on those if you keep the FLT2 frames. If you want to do grinds and such, 55-60mm is fine. If you just want to cruise around, consider getting UFS frames which can house bigger wheels like 80mm.  Small wheels without any in the middle, you will want 88-90a hardness. If you ride all 8 down, you can go up to like 92a without sliding around all crazy.  Big wheels are generally softer, so between 82-88a depending on your weight and what terrain you skate (light/soft, heavy/hard, softer wheels have more shock absorption for bumpy ground as well)"

rollerblading,2s0nnt,bladedvox,2,Sun Jan 11 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"You are very welcome. Noticed your edit, so I'll help you there too, even though there's plenty of places to find this info but here's the short version:  There are no advantages of 2 wheels if you aren't doing grinds. Rocker means, classically, that the front and back wheels are either a little smaller or pushed up a little higher than the middle wheels so that your skate can tilt a bit like a rocking chair. This has the advantage of being hyper-maneuverable, but can be wobbly esp. on jumps & high speeds.  Blade on, bau5"
rollerblading,2s0nnt,WorkinRetail,1 point,Sun Jan 11 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"Hi, just wanted to add my two cents to help you out. You wanted to know about wheel size? The bigger the wheel the faster the skate. It gives you more contact and thus makes it a faster skate. For beginners or those returning to skating 60-80mm are pretty good. (Working at a big retail store, it is hard to find smaller wheels than 80mm unless you go to inline skate specialty shops.) I definitely recommend relearning how to stop and ""falling down."" I also recommend learning how to rotate wheels. With four wheels, a common method is 1 3 2 4. You'll get a longer life out of your wheels with rotating them.   Hope this helps!"

rollerblading,2rrutz,cyanicenine,3,Thu Jan 8 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"As a skier who just picked up rollerblading I feel like the two aren't as similar as you might think.  My biggest pet peeve with rollerblades is that you need pavement, and pavement is dangerous.  On skis I can tomahawk a landing and be okay.  I don't even want to think about tomahawking pavement.  My favorite thing to do on skis is catching big air, whether it's cliff hucking or park jumps, and that is just not safe on blades.  Not just because of my skill level on blades, but because the skate park jumps are just downright tiny by comparison, they would be considered ""beginner"" features on mountain.  Once again, pavement is scary and falls are high consequence even if you armor up, so I understand why the features are as they are, but it still makes for a great divide between skiing and blading.  I'll probably go back to inline once ski season is over, but until then my skates are staying in the closet."

My question is not why aren't more rollerbladers skiing, but why aren't more inline skaters going to the mountain?  I also don't find skateboarding to be the default skier summer sport.  For most skiers the default cross over sport seems to be downhill mountain biking.  If you go up to Whistler in the summer that's all anyone does."
rollerblading,2rrutz,chowaniec,2,Sat Jan 10 01:27:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like the two aren't as similar as you might think   I don't ski park, but they definitely seem different. Blading seems way more technical and dangerous, even though it's slower and smaller (height-wise)."

rollerblading,2rm0sn,Memran,4,Wed Jan 7 08:26:41 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain! I've been quad skating for over a year at this stage. I bought myself a pair of in-lines last summer because I wanted to go skating out-doors on rougher terrain. I packed it in after 3 or 4 sessions because I just couldn't get the hang of it! EVERYTHING is different... stopping, turning, everything!   Fast forward to this winter, I took up ice skating! I've spent about 15hrs ice-skating at this stage, and I'm to a comparable level as with my quads. I cracked out the roller blades again last week, first time since the summer... I was staggered! After 5 mins I was quad-level proficient on the in-lines... Ice is a nice stepping stone!  There's a few things I think you need to unlearn, then you'll be fine. The main one for me was to get more comfortable tilting the whole skate. On quads, the skate/foot stays horizontal to ground, and only slight shift in weight on the inside/outside turns the axel/skate. On ice and in-lines, you need to keep your ankle mostly straight, and tilt the entire skate to turn.  I still can't do stops on in-lines, the ice hockey stop doesn't easily transition :( I've been getting by by putting my skates at 180 degrees and turning in a tight circle.   Practice makes perfect! Happy blading :D"
rollerblading,2rm0sn,kevsparky,1 point,Wed Jan 7 10:52:44 2015 UTC,"Another quad/inline skater here. All I can say is that the transition is always a little bit jarring. Where's my ankle support when I put on inlines??  W/r/t stopping, the T-stop is pretty okay and translates well across both platforms"
rollerblading,2rm0sn,phiber_optic0n,2,Wed Jan 7 15:21:51 2015 UTC,Where's my ankle support when I put on inlines?   In the cuff?... You might need to wear them tighter.
rollerblading,2rm0sn,chowaniec,1 point,Wed Jan 7 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"I've never skated quads, but inlines are definitely their own beast. You almost need to treat them like skis when turning: stagger your feet a bit, bend your knees and lean into the turn with your weight on the balls of your feet.  As for balance and stopping, they both come with practice. T-stops (dragging one foot behind you, sideways) are the easiest way to stop, but they'll wear your wheels if you do them too hard/much. Once you learn to do tight spins, you can use those to scrub off speed too."
rollerblading,2rm0sn,chowaniec,1 point,Wed Jan 7 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Staggering my feet and really concentrating on keeping bent knees helps on turns where I am using both feet, but doing one-foot turns is where I want to be.

K2 makes a 5 in the fatty skates.   There are options, but sadly they are restrictive. The SL's, classic thrones, UFS thrones, remz, Valo TV's, etc only make a 6 as the smallest.

Have you ordered from both these shops in the past and had a good experience?
rollerblading,2rkzvv,PROFESSIONAL_FART,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:33:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I have not personally bought anything from them, since I have only just started aggressive skating, however, from reputation alone I believe that ttb3(/Tornado skate shop or whatever) is as good a place as any for someone to start aggressive skating in China(assuming this person speaks Chinese or has a buddy to buy for him). It seems to me that the owners themselves are made up of local skaters, not some corporate business, and provide knowledgeable help to newbies posting questions on their videos. Tornado have been selling skates for 9 years, so I'm sure they're competent(or at least reasonable?).  But I do have a friend who bought a set of Swiss bearings from the site, these things, for 20 yuan(equivalent to a little over 3 dollars). I tried them out and they ride just one would expect from Swiss, but now they're being discounted to 12 yuan, which is less than two dollars for a full set of Swiss-branded removable-shield bearings. I'm sorry if it looks like I'm just here to advertise, but with offers like that and free seba 80mm ufs frame+seba bearings+80mm street invader wheels for free when you buy the CJ Wellsmore skates, I think it's kinda hard to find fault with these guys. I definitely see some of the best deals on skates and accessories on the internet at sites like these, in China.  With regards to the Arrow skate shop, I'm not so sure about, but they've got Pascal Morasse-Raymond working with them, and he's a good dude. Skates with the pros when they're in town. He's very engaging with Chinese social media. I think he can answer any questions anyone may have about that skate shop."
rollerblading,2rkzvv,franzwithbenefits,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:24:17 2015 UTC,Can you tell us if there are any skates that are so far exclusive to the Chinese market? Are there any great skates that have been flying under our radar? Or do the Chinese buy all the same brands we do?
rollerblading,2rkzvv,franzwithbenefits,1 point,Wed Jan 7 07:01:32 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, I don't think they've yet made a pair of aggressive skates exclusive to China, but slalom and powerslide skating is quite big in Shanghai, so I wouldn't be surprised if something special was made for them (I found out that Seba has a special ""cultural communications company"" (Seba文化传播有限公司) through which they can engage the Chinese market), but maybe there are no skates exclusive to China. I do know that Tornado skate shop does have their own wheels, shark, alpaca, and I think these frames might be a Chinese brand? Other than that, they pretty much skate all the regular brands you see elsewhere in the world.  It's strange how nearly all the skates are made in China, but there aren't that many places to actually get them in China."

I feel like I remember reading somewhere that while the parks were huge, they cheaped out on the construction and they were already starting to deteriorate"
rollerblading,2rhici,fareastcoast,2,Tue Jan 6 19:25:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I thought I mentioned the quality and maintenance in one of the images, but it's not there anymore. I'll edit it in later. But I'd say that the concrete was pretty well maintained considering the vast surface area they have to take care of. I know it looks pretty gritty in some of the pics, but that's just cosmetic and the concrete is very smooth throughout the park, perfect ramps and quarters all around. Of course there are the regular signs of age like in any other skate park, but I tested skating over some of the filled-in cracks and I didn't feel any difference, even on the aggressive-sized wheels. It was overseen by an Australian skatepark company I think, so I'm sure the people making it knew what they were doing. If you've skated in downtown Shanghai, you'd know that the Chinese are capable of making some of the most gloriously smooth swathes of concrete in the world(why do you think they have so many good slalom and drift skaters?)."

rollerblading,2rgqsy,Adamskaj,2,Tue Jan 6 01:29:58 2015 UTC,Yeah D10 skatepark in Palmerstown.
rollerblading,2rgqsy,brassneck,1 point,Tue Jan 6 13:57:54 2015 UTC,Do you know where in Dublin this was by any chance?
rollerblading,2rgqsy,Sanit,2,Tue Jan 6 09:35:11 2015 UTC,We'll be out there today from 6pm onwards if you want to swing by. Few of us heading out.
rollerblading,2rgqsy,brassneck,1 point,Tue Jan 6 14:04:04 2015 UTC,Is it D10? Thanks I appreciate the offer but I actually live in Derry. I am in Dublin fairly regularly for work though.
rollerblading,2rgqsy,Sanit,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:08:27 2015 UTC,That's the one. Next time you're up give us a shout.
rollerblading,2rgqsy,brassneck,1 point,Wed Jan 7 13:51:46 2015 UTC,Cheers will do.
rollerblading,2ren51,makeybussines,2,Mon Jan 5 15:16:18 2015 UTC,http://www.grindhouse.eu/en/Shop/RAZORS/Rucksaecke---Taschen/RAZORS-Humble-6.1-Backpack.html Your skates are still on the outside but won´t bounce around --> plus it looks cool!
rollerblading,2ren51,lDustDevil,3,Mon Jan 5 16:31:40 2015 UTC,I had two different versions of these years ago and they each fell apart after a year or so.  I have no idea how the quality is now though.  Just a warning from someone who's used older versions of these bags.
rollerblading,2ren51,BLRA,2,Mon Jan 5 20:09:42 2015 UTC,"These are okay; not great, but they work. I've had mine for a couple of years and one of the zipper pulls just fell off a few weeks ago. I also had to bend the prongs of the buckles out to get them to lock."
rollerblading,2ren51,chowaniec,1 point,Mon Jan 5 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"Does the whole ""doesn't bounce"" thing work though?"
rollerblading,2ren51,chowaniec,2,Mon Jan 5 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"More or less, yeah. Most skates are pretty secure in the straps, Xsjados fit a bit loose because there's no actual boot."
rollerblading,2ren51,gypsyblader,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:59:03 2015 UTC,Cheers. Should be good for my G10's then.
rollerblading,2ren51,gypsyblader,2,Mon Jan 5 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"Bes bag that I have ever had is my seba backpack, et the big one because the little one sucks.  Ive had it for a year and a half, no rips, tears, nothing went wrong with it.  It has a large volume on the inside. For example I can fit my camera bag inside, a helmet, change of clothes (jeans, hoodie, tshirt, boxers, sox)  Skates hang off the end, there in an internal set of straps, a flap that goes over, and external straps. Impossible for your skates to fall out.  My favourite option is that there is a slit at the bottom with a plastic rain cover that you can pull out and over your bag so the contents outside/inside wont get rain damaged. I live in a humid climate and it could flash rain/snow without a moments notice and I find this very usefull.  Only con is the price, its expensive as shit but will last you a long time. Every other skatebag Ive had (gc,jug,razors) started going kaput in 6-9 months"
