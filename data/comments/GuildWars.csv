Even if you don't have many abilities or the money to kit them out well, heroes will almost always be better than henchmen if given just a decent green weapon you can pick up for 1-2k and whatever spare runes you get from drops.

I believe AB and JQ have more teams on their respective weeks, but the only mode that's actually ""thriving"" is RA pug-wise. There's still some guild groups doing GvG and occasionally people get togheter to do other PvP modes."

RA is ok sometimes, bad others. Not nearly as competitive as it used to be and you'll be waiting a lot longer to get your good team for long glad pt runs.

GuildWars,3e0cv1,tenmillion1,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:26 2015 UTC,I thought that Anet didn't update it the game anymore because of GW2?
GuildWars,3e0cv1,randomkid8,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:16 2015 UTC,http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Game_updates
GuildWars,3e0cv1,dexae,2,Tue Jul 21 05:35:49 2015 UTC,"""classes that are OP to duo with""  Here's my take on that question - Casters are the most flexible in general. This goes for playing alone, and extends to playing together. If you want the best chances of playing the game in every way possible using one set of characters, a mix of rit/necro/ele/mesmer would do you very well. However any class setup will work just fine. Some are weaker than others in general pve encounters - monks and assassins come to mind - but nothing in GW is really bad. They made some updates a few years ago that reworked basically all of the things that had made big gaps between player controlled classes.   I want to put a small note here though - Paragons are really outstanding in team situations using the imbagon build(defensive shout spammer, basically), which is super boring but is outstandingly effective at keeping teams alive through any level of punishment. This build is usually just average for playing alone because you don't kill things as fast as you would given room on your bar for the very strong PvE skills Eye of the North brought to the game, but if you're duoing you will be able to have your second person bring those skills and your overall party would be really, really strong for it. There are many drawbacks to that strategy though - someone has to play a very unflexible and often considered boring class, the build requires you to get luxon or kurzick faction if you don't already have a high enough luxon/kurzick title, etc...  That's just my perspective for absolute optimization. I'd say a more fun/reasonable optimization is to both just pick casters. But the truth is you should just pick what you want to play because everything is viable."
GuildWars,3e0cv1,windfireandice,2,Tue Jul 21 08:22:03 2015 UTC,"Yet assassins are the best build for elite dungeon speed clears and things like that. They're also great runners.   ETA: I don't play one, but I've seen teams of them burn through Slaver's Exile like crazy."
GuildWars,3e0cv1,humanityoptional,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:45 2015 UTC,Some are weaker than others ... assassins come to mind.   ಠ_ಠ
GuildWars,3e0cv1,Zuphixavex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:07 2015 UTC,"They're all good, even Paragons ;) Be aware tho that many parties get cranky if you're a Paragon and want to play something besides Imbagon. As for Assassins.. they can take a while to learn to play well but once you get there you pretty much own the game. You probably wont go wrong with 2 casters of any type but I'd think 2 Monks might not be as much fun. Rangers are awesome, not sure how well 2 of them would work tho. I seldom play warrior but I guess they're ok too if you enjoy that sort of thing."

GuildWars,3dzw7n,logicalwayswins,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"There are still plenty of people trading on NA Kamadan, most of the times making 2 districts.  Generally anything Q10+ isn't worth much, unless it's a nice skin, you can use the following sites:   http://kamadan.decltype.org/ http://www.guildwarsguru.com/forum/price-check-f39.html https://www.facebook.com/groups/kamadan/   It really depends on the skin and it's req, since I think most of the zaishen drops are inscribable. Most of the times you're better off selling 7 unid golds with high req (12-13) for 5k but if you're uncertain because of a nice skin you can always ask. Good luck!"
GuildWars,3dzw7n,TheLilDeath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:48:21 2015 UTC,Thank you!  So gold weapons with a requirement (Q?) of 9 are probably worthwhile to save?  Is there any reason why golds are more sought after than blues given they're the same in terms of stats? Or is it just the prestige of having something more rare?  Or are golds all inscribable?
GuildWars,3dzw7n,Zuphixavex,2,Mon Jul 20 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"Blues and Purples will never drop with max modifiers on them.  If you get an inscribable blue, you can mod it to be perfect, but as you said, most golds are inscribable (you can still get non-inscribable golds from Prophecies, Factions and FoW/UW)   Certain rare skins will also never appear as Blue or Purple items."
GuildWars,3dzw7n,Charl3magne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:47:32 2015 UTC,"The value of a weapon is 100% tied to its rarity and prestige. Gold weapons are really the only ones that have any value, unless there is a purple of an incredibly rare skin (crystalline sword) or low req (req8 or 7). There are a few skins that are worth saving at higher reqs, like Celestial Compasses, or  Voltaic Spear. Spending time browsing the Guru sell forums and sitting in Kamadan is the best way to learn the values of skins.  All gold weapons that drop in Nightfall, EotN, and endgame content chests (FoW, UW, Zchest, etc) will be inscribable, unless you get extraordinarily unlucky and don't roll an inscription slot."
GuildWars,3dzw7n,windfireandice,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:50 2015 UTC,"Good(ish) news: You almost certainly won't encounter anything with an inscription that is of any serious value for the skin. The inscr items that are valuable come from elite content almost exclusively. If you see a cool looking r9/10 weapon though you may consider keeping it and asking around eventually.  The modifiers, however, may be valuable. I recommend getting a knowledge of what percent/stat is highest for each modifier - i.e. +30 health is the highest for a health mod for any weapon. Assume the average max mod that is regularly used is worth 2-5k, with some that are heavily used and on uncommon items(wands/offhands are a good example of this) going as high as 50-60k.  Mods are thankfully far easier to seek out values on, because only a small percent of them are actually used enough to keep. If you get one of the ones people use, you'll be able to sell it easily. Simple as that. Everyone who wants to mod an axe to use on a non-caster is going to be putting a +30 hp grip on it.  Ok here's where it gets more complicated - Items from prophecies and factions can't be inscribed, meaning they're far more unique, because one of their modifiers is unchangeable and random. A simple skin with good mods and a low requirement can be worth a lot of money here. Simply put, I recommend keeping anything you find that has good base mods(again, just look this stuff up and get a feel for it). Once you're more experienced you can look back on these items and determine with a clearer head if you got any gems. There are some extremely valuable drops from totally random places through those two campaigns, again just because it's so rare to get good modifiers on a good skin from places people don't go so often any more."

Anyway there's a lot of new people coming to the game and a more detailed guide would certainly help them if they need to vanquish."
GuildWars,3dwjm6,TheLilDeath,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:23 2015 UTC,Oh I never thought to look at the notes. Thanks!
GuildWars,3dwjm6,davebaggins,3,Mon Jul 20 17:04:59 2015 UTC,"There are two wikis (official and the old fan-created one) that pretty much provides the same/near same info.  The official one provides more info (i.e. War in Kryta, Winds of Change) while the fan-created one hasn't been updated since 2012-2013.    (The fan-created wiki has an expand article on Caravan vanquishing, which the official one does not.)   http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vanquisher http://guildwiki.gamepedia.com/Vanquisher http://guildwiki.gamepedia.com/Caravan_vanquishing   I personally do not think we need another guide on the subject with two existing ones.  Though I feel what is missing is an expanded companion guide on which party team builds work better for each area/map, including tips on hero equipment/strategy, optimal route through map.    Note that both wikis do have VQ/boss notes at the bottom of those Explorable pages that every would-be VQ'er should read prior to VQing an area."

GuildWars,3dwjm6,Caius_GW,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:59 2015 UTC,What do you think is a good way to find weapons for heroes? And is there a consensus on what the best weapons are? I like that shields and spears are static in their bonuses whereas 40/40s and staves in general are unreliable for their procs.

GuildWars,3dwjm6,cretos,2,Mon Jul 20 22:41:42 2015 UTC,How come there's no 40/40 for resto from Gertrud or Talamund?  Is it a bad idea to craft a 20/20 for resto and then a 20/20 for my hero's other used attribute?  And do I really need a 20% enchanting mod for things like Aura of the Lich and Boon of Creation?
GuildWars,3dwjm6,logicalwayswins,2,Mon Jul 20 23:05:07 2015 UTC,"if you want 20% enchant items us a spear. Also if you give the ones with a spear a shield as well they wont get targeted by anti-mage spells such as backfire or chaos storm etc.    May i ask what you need the 20/20 for resto for? my healers are usually necros so have enough energy, and the cooldowns and cast times are pretty short already, i tend to give them spear and shield with armor and or hp.    typically you wanna stick to 40/40 sets instead of splitting it up, its really much more powerful that way.    as for why he doesnt have 40/40 resto, i cannot answer"
GuildWars,3dwjm6,cretos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I want the resto 40/40s because I can be a bit OCDish and I want all my casters to have the same stuff.  Then again my resto heroes usually have PwK so weapons aren't as important."
GuildWars,3dwjm6,logicalwayswins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:04 2015 UTC,healers probably better off with a defensive set anyways imho
GuildWars,3dwjm6,cretos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:34:56 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, a defensive set is a spear and shield, right? I noticed that GWPvX says that for a lot of hero equipment so I assumed it meant a shield with a martial weapon, and probably fortitude mods."
GuildWars,3dwjm6,logicalwayswins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:52 2015 UTC,"yeah spear so they can stay at range, not wand because as i mentioned before spear will avoid being target by anti mage spells"
GuildWars,3dwjna,TeachMeShrimp,2,Mon Jul 20 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"Grab a longbow, go outside Ashford Abbey.  There is always a wolf in the wurm field, but it won't always spawn close enough to use, you may need to rezone a few times.  What you want to do is shoot it with a longbow, pull it as far as it will come, walk backwards and move side-to-side as you walk. Eventually it will give up and run, follow it but not too close.  After running for a while it will start walking again at a slower speed, this is when you shoot again. It will follow you as before, this time coming a little further before running away.  Repeat until you get to the resurrection shrine next to Gwen's mother.  When you're actually deathleveling it, you can afk but keep an eye on it, it can occasionally stray too far and you have to pull it agian."

GuildWars,3dwjna,Sharkiie101,2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:31 2015 UTC,I think they are asking about death leveling the wolf before they tame it. Like how before the vanguard quests came you had to death level the charr outside the gates to get defender of Ascalon

GuildWars,3du34o,World_51,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"Guild wars has some serious fragmenting problems which can cause things like rubberbanding. you can us some software like defraggler and just defrag gw.dat and not your entire drive. You will probably still have some latency problems because the servers are shared with GW2 servers and are probably not allocated the resources they need, but doing this took the game form a completely unplayable state to being good enough for me."
GuildWars,3du34o,caliban_6,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:08:15 2015 UTC,"if u have no latency  and just pure rubberband/stuck, then you are probably alt tabbing from full screen to other windows. that can cause a shit ton of rubber banding"

Usually my ping is nothing but then again, I live in Washington state so I'm really close to the servers I believe.  Kind of disappointing if the farther you move away from the servers the worse it gets.  Maybe ANET only allocated enough resources to handle a certain number of people and now it's starting to exceed those resources?  Just a thought."

GuildWars,3dt4lf,tkinneyv,3,Sun Jul 19 05:02:33 2015 UTC,"Most of those 4-man areas are doable using any sabway variation, but it helps a lot if your toon has high enough Ebon Vaguard title track for the Rebel Yell buff.  Some other tips:   lots of DP removal. plan your vq map route pattern, avoid bosses until near the end -- if you have DP kill a boss or two to remove it. note/make use of any temple blessing in the area deactivate/remove any titan quest before heading out   If you do decide to Caravan VQ'ing those 4-man areas from Yaks Bend or ToA:   reorder/reposition the heroes in the party list you would like to control individually (i.e. like pinning hero monks in the back line) have some merch summoning stones or a lot of inventory space and/or salvage kits note the location of merchants/traders along the way   Personal notes:  Having VQ's those 4-man areas on two toons (both using 4-man, 6-man, and 8-man parties) I have used both sabway and discord (both modded to my liking).  My main is a rit, so I play either a straight SOS build or a discord caller.  My primary heroes are the three necos then ""three"" mesmers or ""two"" mesmers, followed by either a monk or paragon hero.  Favorite hero team build is discord, modded to include ""Stand your ground"" and ""Anthem of weariness"" somewhere on one or two hero skill bars (shouts are instant and not easily stripped by Prophecies foes).  (Heroes are spec'ed out in 20/20 caster sets except for the item carriers.)  My impressions on party size:   4-man party - used sabway - had high enough Ebon Vaguard title for Rebel Yell buff to make a difference (IMO) 6-man party (started from Yaks) - same as above; brought hero monk and mesmer. 8-man party (started from ToA) - 3 discord necs, 2 mesmers, 1 healing monk, and forget what what I bought for the 7th hero.   8-man is the longest time (as others have noted), which I personally didn't find that bad (about 1.5-2 hours getting to the 4-man areas).  My trouble was in the garbage collection (drops/full bags, etc.) and the fact that discord heroes isn't idea for all map VQs.  If there is anything else to add, I like to say read some of the old gw1 info (wikis/articles/guides, etc), such as some of the following links:   http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guide_to_PvE http://www.guildwarsguru.com/forum/basic-guide-using-heroes-t10293264.html http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vanquisher#Larger_party_sizes http://guildwiki.gamepedia.com/Vanquisher http://guildwiki.gamepedia.com/Caravan_vanquishing   Disclaimer: much of the info provide above is from history as it was back in 2009-2012.

Bit slower than 8 mans but that's the way it is.   Ps I would love to finish up some of those zones with you if you want a partner to vq them - especially if you're doing a caravan from yaks. I did 3 or 4 of the ascalon zones but windows decided to do an update while I slept and now I'm stuck making the journey back.

I thought it was kind of fun putting together builds and working your way through Prophecies.  The builds on PvX are by no means the end all be all but just a bunch of subjective opinions on what the ""best"" is.  Although the best includes a Panic build that quickly runs out of the energy and an Illusions build that quickly runs out of energy waits until it gets to ten energy and casts clumsiness until the battle is over.  Just my shitty opinion.  Don't listen to me though, I'm dumb and trying to go through Prophecies in Hard Mode with below sixty AR and henchmen.    TLDR.

Prophecies is quite difficult with henchmen.  I'd say pause it and go for NF and EotN to collect heroes, and unlock some skills. As your heroes level up you get ""Hero Skill Points"" which you can use to unlock skills just like normal, but the list of available skills is much smaller and you don't have to pay gold, check here and here for a list of skills.  Go for the important skills first, you may already have most of them: Splinter Weapon, Strength of Honor, Mark of Pain, Protective Spirit, Cry of Frustration, Mistrust. The Elites are the most powerful to use, but there are still plenty of alternatives that work, don't think that you can't use the builds without the Elites."

GuildWars,3dqktd,hazyPixels,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:56:46 2015 UTC,Be careful and flag your party back. Pull groups to them patiently and be meticulous about it. Henchmen can only handle so much.  Not using the walk-through really isn't an option when you're dealing with henchmen because you need all the help you can get.   Make sure that you're calling targets to focus your damage.  If it's not overly difficult you should look to find and kill the Sand Giants to pick up a morale boost.  You can get a full 10% morale boost this way.  Make sure that you talk to the Ghostly Hero after he opens the door and leave him there; you don't want to have to protect him.    You can use control/click or control-space to call-targets. It's a habit that you should get used to.

GuildWars,3dq2wc,_hungry_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:11:51 2015 UTC,That seems really interesting! I hadn't thought of bringing a spirit or Poison Tip Signet.  Many of the builds I've been looking over include a resurrection skill; why is that? Usually it seems that it's put on a hero instead.
GuildWars,3dq2wc,MaesterIcey,3,Sat Jul 18 10:24:46 2015 UTC,"Between spamming Barrage and Splinter Weapon you really don't have the energy to do anything else. Savage and Distracting Shot are both just there in case you can catch an enemy ability. (Get the heals!)  The Imp, while somewhat expensive, will pay off in the sense of additional AoE damage that keeps the enemies packed with the slow.  As for the signet or other resurrects, since you're already at the back its really easy for you to disengage and then use it to safely resurrect an ally. Bonus points for Rebirth and Rebirth Signet because it also gives the ally some time to get their act together. These 2 also make for an excellent safeguard against party wipes."
GuildWars,3dq2wc,MaesterIcey,2,Sat Jul 18 10:34:37 2015 UTC,"I should add that, in PvP variations, a resurrect skill is often mandatory because people. will. die."
GuildWars,3dq2wc,Zuphixavex,2,Sat Jul 18 10:36:54 2015 UTC,"Even though Poison Tip Signet is not removed by Barrage like Apply Poison, it will only apply the Poison to a single target, not all 7.  I would recommend Favorable Winds for a little extra damage and higher accuracy (lower projectile arc) which means you can use a Flatbow and get the longest range and attack speed, otherwise I would use a Longbow. You can bring it around as well as Vampirism with Summon Spirits if you feel like it.  You can bring Volley so you don't have to use basic attacks as often.  If you have a Ritualist Hero, put Splinter Weapon on them so they can give you it at a higher attribute. If you're the only person in the group with a non-magic weapon they will use it on you automatically, otherwise I would disable it and force them to cast in on you."

If you really wanted to use it, take the Barrage build and take splinter weapon on a hero (Sos hero works great) like /u/An0n-E-M0use said.  If you are looking for some more builds, and don't mind using dagger spam, this is a pretty good build or if you want a pet  If you have your heart set on using a bow, just put together any build that you like, and let your heros do the hard work like the rest of us :)"
GuildWars,3dq2wc,hazyPixels,2,Sat Jul 18 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"I don't care for Splinter Barrage much as it seems the situation isn't always optimal for it to do a lot of damage, Seems you pretty much need a balled up mob for it to work well and often they are spread out so the effect fails. When I do use it I often bring ""I Am The Strongest"" for a damage buff, and Spirit Siphon so I can get extra energy from any nearby spirits. However I prefer an Incendiary build over S/B and I usually have a SoS hero bring Splinter Weapon to cast on me. Incendiary just seems to kill mobs so much faster than S/B."

OgAUY3rijsSYHLGXizkyl8g4G0GA  It's built around Scavenger Strike for energy management (13 energy if your pet strikes a foe with a condition). Call your pet's targets using the Poison Tip signet to trigger the energy gain.  Spread AOE damage with Barrage pumped up with Favorable Winds and ""I Am The Strongest!"" and the Splinter Weapon when applied by your hero.  Maintain 'Never Rampage Alone' constantly to keep you and your pet attacking at +25% speed with 3 pips of health.  Initiate combat by casting 'Pain Inverter' on any nukers or bosses, and continue to apply it to high damage dealing foes.  With Scavenger Strike, you should be able to do all those things consistently.  ETA: This build works well with a vamp bow, as Never Rampage Alone negates the -1 pip health penalty, and 5 armor ignoring damage is sweet. The health gain also makes your monk's job easier."

GuildWars,3dmagi,GoblinTechies,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:48 2015 UTC,"Yep!   Everyone recalls onto one warrior. He follows their flag runner back to the gate of their base (once it's open) using Death's Charge. Everyone drops their recalls and suddenly the entire team is in the base.   3 warriors bodyblock the gate with a monk in support, 3 warriors and a monk head to the boat to clean up.  A smart opponent (not this one) would immediately split both ways - though even that may work - depending on the map. I can't remember the rest, but certainly on Warrior's Isle you can block one gate with 3 people and the other with 2, so you still have capability to take down NPCs."

Is there a possibility that you added the GW1 key to your GW2 e-mail address? Try logging in (to GW1) with your GW2 information.   Creating an account through the launcher seems pretty straight-forward, but I haven't done it in several years.     You click the ""Create Account or Add Access Key"" below the login/security question. Enter in an e-mail address and password, make sure to tick ""Create a New Guild Wars account"" in the middle on the far right.  Afterwards you check your Region then enter your activation serial key.    Linking your GW2 account to your GW1 account is pretty simple. You go into ""My Account"" then you go to Link Accounts and enter in your GW1 email/password. After which you can login to either account with your GW2 login."

GuildWars,3dlu1s,markezy,3,Fri Jul 17 08:59:02 2015 UTC,"First I'd just like to welcome you to the game!  Secondly, the Guild Wars wiki is very very useful for finding out about where things are within the game. For example, you can search for Ritualist Armor and see how they all look and where to find them.   About Kamadan (and the game in general), you have to be in the American servers. Those are pretty much the only active ones. And it is supposed to say (Party Search) when selling something. Nothing wrong there.   The price of Z keys and ectos fluctuate over time and I'm not sure what they cost right now, sorry!  The easiest way of telling what you need to do to get more HoM points is if you told us your characters name, but I think the ""Any Pet Statue"" point is really easy to get. Here's a small tutorial to how to get it.    Create a PvP Ranger. Get it to the Zaishen Menagerie. (Map travel there from where you are.) Take the Comfort Animal skill with you. Go in to the portal in the Zaishen Menagerie. Talk to Emryd The Tamer. Give her your pet. Log in to your Ritualist, click the boat icon and teleport to Great Temple of Balthazar.  Go to Zaishen Menagerie. Just a bit right of Emryd The Tamer is a girl called Helena. Talk to her and ask her to spawn a lvl 20 Wolf.  Charm the Wolf (Remember to bring the skill Charm Animal). Take the Wolf to HoM.   I also just wanted to say that it's important to make yourself like the game if you're going for more HoM points in the future. Playing a game you don't like isn't very fun at all.   Cheers mate!"

GuildWars,3dkuv1,Zuphixavex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:14:16 2015 UTC,"I came back to the game 2 weeks ago - was about 5k short for sweet, 6k short for party, and 8k short for drunk. I picked them all up in one day spamming to buy for 3e/stack in kama.  I imagine it's even easier during events like halloween. Don't worry. The game isn't even close to too dead to buy stuff like that. Just expect to spend 300+ ecto maxing it, and much more if you don't take cheap options(lots of people offered me tonics and firework boxes - I offered them around 1/4-1/3 of the price I was spending on normal stuff and often got them. You could theoretically save a lot of money by buying stuff like that and convincing people to give it to you for low prices because it's a hassle to use.)  Also prices for a lot of things are fairly reflective of what they were 5 years ago - if you have, say, a decent req BDS or eternal blade or something like that you can likely sell it and buy these titles with no farming. Some items have been hit really hard though because of ultra fast SC's - specifically I've noticed a harsh drop in price for frog scepters and obsidian blades. But if you were a fairly well off player previously you should still be fine. Something you have is worth enough.   You could also consider selling your presents unopened if you have a lot of 7th bday gifts. You can get 10-15e/each for 7th bday(you're giving up the chance to gamble on 300-800e pets, but the odds aren't in your favor. I got 9 purples and 2 golds from my 7th bday presents personally.)  6th bday also sells for a bit. 5< is mostly worthless but you can probably convince someone to take a gamble at like 2e/box, which isn't bad if you have a full account of gifts."
GuildWars,3dkuv1,windfireandice,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:14:16 2015 UTC,I get consumables for all three titles as a byproduct of farming and usually sell a full title for 100e or so. It's certainly viable to buy from players.

UW with its revised quests will take a bit of polishing up, I did the old UW countless times but I only did the new one 30-50 times and it was always SC so I wasn't doing the whole thing as a unified run. It just isn't second nature like old UW/the other older content.  But anyway most of that stuff is pretty easy with well equipped heroes, especially if you just want to see them in NM(there's no difference for the HoM between HM and NM I don't think?). I've been playing the game again for a week or two and I've already done FoW for/with someone who was new and didn't have sufficient heroes. There wasn't any real hassle, but the content was as fun as ever.  Not sure about urgoz/the deep - I know they're easy with tailored builds but I don't know how a generic balanced hero setup works for them without a player tank or strategies more advanced than ""run in, kill stuff"".
