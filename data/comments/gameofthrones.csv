gameofthrones,3e11u0,A_Kindly_Man,32,Tue Jul 21 10:14:21 2015 UTC,At 8 ft 400 lbs he'd still be freakishly strong. Wilt Chamberlain was 7'1'' 276lbs and had incredibly strength according to Arnold Schwarzenegger.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzIu7o5NH1k&feature=player_embedded#!  So you could imagine what adding an extra foot and 130 lbs would do.
gameofthrones,3e11u0,gives_you_cookies,17,Tue Jul 21 12:39:12 2015 UTC,Hafthor is 400 pounds though and more than a whole foot too short. Being able to hack men in half with a single blow with a 6 foot two handed sword only using one hand would require a lot more than incredible strength.
gameofthrones,3e11u0,nick2k23,7,Tue Jul 21 12:55:49 2015 UTC,Like what? The right sword (weight and sharpness)? Genuinely curious
gameofthrones,3e11u0,HolyHarris,4,Tue Jul 21 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"While having a good sword is important, hacking something in half is more about the technique. The weight of the sword will, if swung properly be enough to cut someone in half. We have to remember that when it's described we probably arnt talking about a man in a full suit. So realistically the person would only have a leather chestpiece if any armor at all.  A 6ft Greatsword would be about 8 to 10 lbs. While that doesn't sound like much its a lot to swing considering the length. With one hand you would have to be extremely strong to have any measure of control on that.  For record I am 6'2"" 225 and i can swing a 4ft 4lbs sword and probably could do it with that. I would expect that i could hold the 6ft with one hand. I definitely could not freely swing it.   TL;DR To have the control and technique with one hand is the limiting factor imo."

For a full size man, it is easy enough to swing with the necessary velocity to cut a man in two. Now imagine swinging something twice as long as five times as heavy. You'd have to be a giant to swing that with enough force to chop a man using one hand."

gameofthrones,3e11u0,mishac,4,Tue Jul 21 15:08:47 2015 UTC,Pretty much.  EDIT: I think he has his helmet on whenever he's in public so people don't know he's blue.

I havent read the books but I'm pretty sure in the books no one is even sure if he has a head or not. You cant see his face through the guard and he never has his armor off. Also a giant skull large enough it must be the Mountain's is sent to prince Doran to smooth things over with Dorne a bit. People suspect something is weird because he never eats, sleeps, or goes to the bathroom but they dont know for sure but in the show you can see enough of his face to clearly know some kind of fuckery is weirding about here."

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,MadSweeney42,9,Mon Jul 20 22:52:31 2015 UTC,If Azor Ahai hadn't ended the long night none of this would have happened! Totally his fault.
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,7BitBrian,60,Tue Jul 21 05:28:48 2015 UTC,Well Catelyn would not have gone to Kings Landing to find the owner of the Valyrian dagger used in Bran's assassination attempt. She would not have ran into Tyrion at the Inn of the Crossroads and taken him prisoner resulting in Twyin calling his banners and Gregor raiding the riverlands.
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,dumpsterhumpin,27,Tue Jul 21 01:08:16 2015 UTC,Ned would still declare for Stannis after Robert's death and so would still be put in the black cells by Cersei which would cause Robb to raise his banners in the North which would cause Tywin to raise his banners too. Gregor won't end up raiding the Riverlands but the River Lords would probably still side with the North.
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,champmaex,67,Tue Jul 21 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"Eddard would have been instead flanked by his household guard as well as loyal men like Beric Dondarrion, rather than be left with only the leftovers that were left after he sent them all off to hunt down Gregor Clegane. Jory and many of his other men killed by Jaime's men would still have been around as well. Eddard would likewise be without injury. When it came to the confrontation in the throne room, it would've been Eddard's Northmen up against Cersei's Lannister soldiers - a fight much more in Eddard's favor. Given that Barristan recognized the validity of the king's orders, he would have kept the Kingsguard out of the conflict or sided with Eddard.   Most importantly, he wouldn't have needed Littlefinger at all. And given the presence of his household guard, Renly might have been more likely to gamble on Eddard's side even if there was no gain for him."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,gamehiker,29,Mon Jul 20 21:11:06 2015 UTC,"Damn you're right, I totally didn't think about that. Makes you appreciate how similar Jon getting FTWed is to Ned's downfall. In the books (although not in the show) Very minor ADWD"
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,champmaex,10,Mon Jul 20 22:43:54 2015 UTC,I'm glad I checked the thread before I posted again. This is how I think it would have played out as well. Even if Ned was taken prisoner Twyin wouldn't necessarily have started raiding the riverlands because their allegiance had not been previously established.
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,dumpsterhumpin,5,Mon Jul 20 23:04:35 2015 UTC,"Most importantly, he wouldn't have needed Littlefinger at all.   More importantly he wouldn't even have trusted him since Catelyn wouldn't had been in King's Landing to vouch for him."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Eberon,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:13 2015 UTC,Didn't Robert only go hunting because of the fight between ned and Jaime? I wonder how that'll pan out in the alternate universe
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,evilsdeath,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:47 2015 UTC,I think he went hunting despite the fight between Ned and Jaime. But anyway I'm sure Cersei would have found another opportunity to bump him off.
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,champmaex,52,Tue Jul 21 05:34:59 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying, these ""butterfly effect"" posts always get me fired up because I'm exactly the kind of dork who thinks they're fun.  I'm not arguing with you or your conclusions, just adding!  Bran doesn't fall, which means the assassin never tries to kill him.  Catelyn never goes temporarily mad, never leaves Winterfell to go talk to Ned some more about the Lannisters and what assholes they are, never intercepts Tyrion on the way back, and never takes him prisoner.  This means Ned never gets attacked in the streets by Jaime and doesn't lose five of his household guard.  (It was five, right?  It was five in the books, and I know we're in the show sub, so I might be wrong about the number)  So when Robert dies and Ned comes to name Stannis as the king, Robb and Catelyn are both hanging out at Winterfell, doing Northpeople things, not a care in the world.  Any ravens Ned might have sent would be far, far, far too slow to get to them between Robert's death and the confrontation.    Ned is also surrounded by his full household guard, not just whoever was left after Jaime got through with them, and he himself is uninjured.  In the grand scheme of things, a few extra men isn't going to be much help to Ned, nor is a working leg.  However, it's enough to tip the balance scales a little so that Littlefinger has a harder time convincing the Gold Cloaks to back Cersei & Joffrey instead of Ned & Stannis.  He's got to offer them more, because their lives are at greater risk.  Slynt is going to get a whole lot more than just Harrenhall for this, which could make him a bigger and more formidable player later down the line.    Meanwhile, Robb and Cat get the news that Ned has been arrested, and it comes completely out of the blue.  Robb hasn't already called his banners.  He isn't already marching halfway down the neck.  He was seriously just watching Rickon poke Theon with a stick and laughing, and now here's Maester Luwin telling him ""King Robert is dead, your father's been arrested and named a traitor, and King Joffrey wants you to mosey down to King's Landing to swear fealty""  Now, left to his own devices, Robb would call the banners.  We know this, because that's what he did do.  But with Cat there, he's going to defer to her judgment.  The only reason he ever started acting like the Lord of Winterfell was because Cat sort of forced him to by being glued to Bran's sickbed and later leaving.  Before that, he still acted more or less like a boy who is ""almost a man grown.""  But what would Cat do?  She mistrusts the Lannisters.  She thinks they're responsible for killing Jon Arryn, and now she's probably pretty sure they had a hand in killing Robert.  She knows there's absolutely no way that Ned is a traitor.  But Sansa and Arya are at King's Landing, and she knows that calling the banners and going to war means she will probably never see her girls again.  Right now, the Lannisters are aware that the North could come marching down on them for this, and Catelyn is the one who makes the decision.  The Lannisters would probably gladly hand over the Stark girls in exchange for some oaths of fealty at this point.  So yeah, I think Robb's part in the War of Five Kings is eliminated.  Which probably also cuts out Balon's part, so it becomes the War of Three Kings.  The North may well side with Stannis, which has even more cause-and-effect stuff, but I've already gone and typed all this, and I think my laundry is almost done."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,SharMarali,37,Tue Jul 21 10:14:27 2015 UTC,"Ned is also surrounded by his full household guard, not just whoever was left after Jaime got through with them, and he himself is uninjured.   Ned also sent a bunch of his men (50?) off with Baeric Dondarrion to hunt down the Mountain.  If Cat never arrested Tyrion, the Mountain doesn't get let loose by Tywin, so that doesn't happen either.  As another poster pointed out, if Ned has his full guard, maybe Renly doesn't run off either."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Not_Stupid,15,Tue Jul 21 10:36:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was sitting here trying to make the numbers work to figure out where the rest of Ned's household guard had gone and I finally decided to gloss over it.  I completely forgot about the men he sent with Beric."

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,SmexyPro,12,Mon Jul 20 23:23:47 2015 UTC,"Slynt was a coward though. Give Ned all his murdered men + everyone he sent to the Riverlands and maybe even Renly's men and suddenly you don't have a slaughter. Who knows what the goldcloaks would have done. There's also the fact that with a lot more men, Ned would never have had to put his faith in Baelish"

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,huffmanm16,7,Mon Jul 20 23:36:25 2015 UTC,"Consider this: the entire war between the Lannisters and the north came about because Twyin wanted Tyrion back. If Bran never fell, Catelyn wouldn't have taken Tyrion hostage, Jaime wouldn't have been captured and all the Lannister armies would have been available for the fight against Stannis (should that all still have taken place after Ned tells Cersei that he knows her dirty little secrets). That said, if there wasn't already a war involving the Starks, the Greyjoys, and all included bannermen against the Lannisters, Stannis might not have even attempted an attack on Kings Landing, since there were no other distractions. Or, if he did anyway, the Starks and all the northmen might have joined Stannis and made a well-coordinated effort that might have won Stannis his throne.  There's all kinds of ifs, maybes, and could-have-beens involved in the entire story. It's fun to think of alternate ways the story could have gone though."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,djak,9,Tue Jul 21 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"Like I said I feel like Bran never falling would only delay certain events a little bit. I think the real cause of the War of Five Kings was Robert dying, which IMO would only start a war between 4 kings (not including Robb) but the fact that Joffery had Ned executed plays a larger part in the war between the North and the Westerlands."

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,snap_wilson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but even prior to that he was considering it because of the letter that Catelyn got.

We don't know if he made the decision before or after Bran got hurt IIRC."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,YoYoSun,5,Mon Jul 20 22:36:23 2015 UTC,"Also it's worth mentioning that with all the schemes of Little Finger, Varys and who ever else in the game at the time, if things didn't go the way they wanted they would just have set another play in motion.

And when she asks him what he wants? ""Everything."" So yeah, I do believe his end goal is the iron throne. And I hope by the end of this, karma comes back for him and makes sure he ends up with absolutely  nothing."

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Eat-the-Rich,2,Mon Jul 20 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm calling it a theory is because although we know he's been behind a lot of what's been going down in Westeros we don't know what he's after (imo ""everything"" doesn't count) and we don't know for sure that he's done everything we think he has. So the ""theory"" isn't that Little Finger has orchestrated all the chaos but the theories are more about why and what he's after."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,pmMeYour_Bewbs,0,Mon Jul 20 21:32:38 2015 UTC,I don't think he was just being lucky per say. I think he just somehow found a way to bend every form of chaos to his advantage. He is smart.
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Eat-the-Rich,3,Mon Jul 20 21:35:57 2015 UTC,An example of him being lucky would be (assuming he's the one who sent the assassin after Bran) that Bran fell from the tower making it even easier to cause a divide between two great houses than he initially planned. Look up RedTeamReview on YouTube he has a couple video's about how even though Petyr is a great planner he has also had some great luck with certain events making his plans infinitely easier.
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,bulldoozer,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:29 2015 UTC,And littlefinger was hellbent on getting the Starks and Lannisters to make war... Bran seeing incest and falling was never part of his plan. He still would have found a way

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Hepzibah3,41,Tue Jul 21 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"Littlefinger wanted a war between the Starks and Lannisters so he could play out his scheme. One way or another LF wanted to become a High Lord,so he schemed and started a war which saw the Starks utterly obliterated from power,the Tully's held in a dungeon, the Lannisters hanging on by a very skinny thread (Cersei's sanity or lack thereof) the Tyrells in a strong position and the Arryns,also hanging on by a skinny thread.In killing Jon Arryn LF sets up the chaos he needs to succeed."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,mantidor,6,Tue Jul 21 02:05:37 2015 UTC,isn't it all but confirmed the assassination attempt on Bran (at least on the show) was Littlefinger's doing?
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,EvadableMoxie,28,Tue Jul 21 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"No, Littlefinger was in King's Landing, there is no way (LF's teleporter jokes aside) that he could have learned what happened to Bran and then arranged an assassination attempt in a few days.    Not even a raven would go that fast and even if one could, there is no way anyone could have sent one from Winterfell without Maester Luwin knowing, and he certainly wasn't complicit in a plot to assassinate Bran.  LF couldn't have arranged it in advance because there no way he could know that Bran would catch Jaime and Cercesi going at it and then fall and be in a coma.  In the books, Tyrion thinks Joffrey arranged it, and is probably right. Using a special dagger is dumb, even for Cerscei.  Tyrion remembers Robert saying it would be better to just kill Bran and end his suffering and thinks Joffrey did it to impress Robert.  I don't think the show ever addresses who was behind it."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Hepzibah3,13,Mon Jul 20 18:27:22 2015 UTC,"No,it was Joffrey's doing,although some people think that Joffrey listened to Littlefinger in doing some of the stuff we hated him for (ie executing Ned at the Baelor,soooo)yeah I guess in effect you could say it was LF."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,K4ylan,11,Mon Jul 20 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"It's not confirmed to be Joffrey's doing, Tyrion just guesses that because he knows Joffrey heard his ""father"" saying that they should put Bran out of his misery. He figures that he wanted to do it so Bobby will be proud of him, but personally I don't think that fits Joffrey's MO."
gameofthrones,3dz1nm,ScarOCov,3,Mon Jul 20 21:07:21 2015 UTC,In the book there's some reference by Joffrey about the valyrian steel dagger that was used that pretty much solidifies it was him.

Ned wants to tell him about his children, but decides not to because the king was already in enough pain. That scene struck me as where it all went wrong.   If he'd told Robert the truth then, the horror at the knowledge that he had no trueborn heirs would have at least been tempered by an opportunity to destroy the Lannisters with his last day of life.  It also occurred to me that this whole affair is what made Cersei so incredibly cocksure for the rest of the series. Her scheming turns out brilliantly for her in this case, though it was far from a sure thing. Her plots in ADwD don't come together so well."

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Hautamaki,4,Mon Jul 20 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"Bran climbing the tower might not have been just some random coincidence or happenstance.  There is a theory that the three-eyed-crow/the dude he meets in the cave under the tree is actually Bloodraven, and has been sending Bran (and perhaps many others, probably including Jojen and possibly including Ramsay) visions/dreams purposefully in order to manipulate them.  Bran climbing that tower and discovering the incest might very well have been an important part of Bloodraven's overall plan.  And perhaps if he had failed to get Bran to climb the tower, he would have set his plan into motion in other ways.  Besides which, Littlefinger's plan to create chaos and indebt many lords throughout the lands to him to personally increase his wealth and power would have continued apace.  As would Illyrio and Varys and Marwyn and Doran Martell's plans.  Basically a lot of people have been spending a lot of time preparing various schemes and plots and Bran climbing up to see Jaime and Cersei getting funky is really just one small part of a much larger series of events purposefully set into motion by many different power players throughout Westeros and Essos."

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,archaruswow,2,Mon Jul 20 21:28:59 2015 UTC,Right but one of the big reasons Ned left was to investigate the death of Jon Arryn. He'd still most likely be killed and the war of five kings would still occur.

gameofthrones,3dz1nm,Peridoe,3,Tue Jul 21 06:03:22 2015 UTC,"Bran witnessing what he did and ending up in a coma for it certainly escalated the chain of events that followed. But personally, I believe, like some others posting here, that some of these events were destined to happen regardless.  So say Bran never saw Jamie and Cersei. Baelish and Lysa still would've killed off Jon Arryn, leading Robert Baratheon to trundle up to Winterfell to ask his best friend Ned Stark to be his new Hand of the King. Ned would still accept because he's honorable and loyal. However, I believe Ned would still of figured out why Arryn was killed which would still result in him being labled a traitor after King Robert was killed (it was only a matter of time before Cersei killed off him off).  As to the resulting war, I'm not sure. Would Rob Stark call his banners to free his father and sisters? Possibly. He'd surely want to. But I'm more inclined to think that he and Catelyn would believe there was just some huge misunderstanding (Ned, a traitor??), and go to King's Landing in an attempt to resolve the problem instead. Also, with Tyrion not being captured by Catelyn, Tywin wouldn't be calling his banners either.  However, Stannis and Renly would still rise up and challenge the throne. Plus Danaerys is still across the pond."

The reality is all Stark children (even Jon the bastard) have the ability to warg, it comes from their connection to their direwolves.

She talks about how he would come back from the hunt and give her a pelt and she would give him a baby. I think Cersei named the children, but Robert wouldn't have argued to name the kids after his kickass friends for political reasons."
gameofthrones,3e1vwr,Au_Serenity,6,Tue Jul 21 12:23:26 2015 UTC,Robert was a whipped bastard and Cersei named their children.  In the book he spends almost the entire time at winterfell being whipped by Cersei. He has no balls in their relationship. Its especially telling during the Lady incident.
gameofthrones,3e1vwr,Lord_NiteShade,17,Tue Jul 21 11:55:10 2015 UTC,I'd say its less Cersei has him whipped and more Tywin does due to the crown's large dept owed to him

gameofthrones,3e1vwr,Rosebunse,5,Tue Jul 21 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure why about Robert, there's no real response there, but I presume Robert didn't really care quite that much (although he seemed to devote attention enough to his bastards).    And Robb was born before Ned returned from the war, so Catelyn likely named Robb in Roberts honor, not Ned."

gameofthrones,3e1vwr,Rosebunse,5,Tue Jul 21 12:25:07 2015 UTC,"It's likely he didn't name his first child at all, he was away at war and Cat birthed the child alone."

gameofthrones,3e2oty,ManicSancho,5,Tue Jul 21 14:25:41 2015 UTC,"Basically. Not as bad, since overall the free cities are further south, but they still get the severe winters, and they still experienced the long night when it happened and would experience it if a new one occured"
gameofthrones,3e2oty,ejelder21,6,Tue Jul 21 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"They are a lot like Europe. It's the same latitude as Canada, but because of climate differences it doesn't have the same severity of winter.   Likewise, if you look at a map the free cities of Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, and Qohor are pretty much in line with the North, but they have a much much more temperate winter.  There's nothing in the books that says the Free Cities experience the brutal ""10 years of snow and death."" winters the North gets, so it stands to reason theirs arent as bad."
gameofthrones,3e2oty,Lord_NiteShade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that's a good question.  But technically, if winter was that bad in Westeros, it would likely effect the rest of the world as well."
gameofthrones,3e2oty,Rosebunse,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"The cities are all close to the coast where the climate is usually less extreme. The harshest winters were reported from the northern part of Westeros, from areas further away from the coast, but (correct me if I'm wrong) there haven't been reports of freezing ports on any of the continents so far.   We know the random multi-year seasons are world wide, so it is safe to assume the free cities are affected as much as Westeros is, but accordingly to their location at the sea and their latitude it wouldn't be the extreme we've heard about from people of Westeros' North. Braavos, being the northernmost of the free cities, is at the same latitude as the Vale or the Neck, after all."
gameofthrones,3e2oty,Ylaaly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:09 2015 UTC,The free cities are probably spared longer but I would think a long enough winter would get to them. Essos itself has its own world ending shit that comes from the east similarly to how the winter and walkers come from the north in Westeros.

gameofthrones,3e317i,Mdogg2005,6,Tue Jul 21 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"With how popular it is, I'm sure that this property is going to be relevant for a long time, even after A Dream of Spring comes out.   A series/miniseries of Roberts Rebellion is probably the most likely spin-off. Maybe one of whatever actually happened to Benjen if it isn't revealed by the end. Aegon's Conquest is also possible, but probably too CGI heavy for a miniseries.   Also a live action adaptation of Dunk and Egg, hopefully."
gameofthrones,3e317i,ItSaidMakeAUsername,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"All of these are things I would love to watch.  I just figured since there's a lot of talking (whining? Complaining? worrying?) that the show will end the series before the final book is barely started.  If they decided to do the spin-offs now rather than wait, they'd be in a much better situation in that regard, but also for the people who just care about the show, they may be a bad thing.  It can go either way really, and since other shows seem to be doing it too (Walking Dead, maybe others?) I don't think it'd be too foreign of a concept aside from the fact that Walking Dead will run along side its spin-off.  With all the rich backstory and lore we have to work with that relates to the events that pre-date the books / show, taking a year break from the main series in favor of one of these spin-offs would give some time for the books to come out as well.  Just thinking out loud."
gameofthrones,3e317i,tianoa,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a mini-series or even a one season ten episode series based on Robert's Rebellion. However I doubt it will happen before the series is over. Since HBO is subscription based and doesn't have to rely on in show ad revenue to make money, I doubt they would want to give us double the Game of Thrones for one year when they can force us to hold on that subscription even longer while we wait for a mini-series prequel. Plus, GRRM has told the show runners how the show is going to end, and while he's distanced himself from the show in past few seasons to focus on the books, I would imagine he would still maintain some level of involvement. Even though Season 6 doesn't air until next March filming is underway now which means the scripts are written so the show is already heading into uncharted territory.   TL;DR: I would love to see a prequel series, wouldn't be surprised if there was one, but I don't see any reason for HBO to do it before the series ends"
gameofthrones,3e317i,roundheadedmanc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"We're still waiting on the winds of winters and that's probably a year off and then it's will be like 5 more years till the last book. The actors can't stop aging, they need to wrap it up in the next few years.  Based of what has been said they will do more game of thrones after these books end. Dance with dragons or aegon probably not because it would require sooo much cgi for the dragons and huge scale battles. Roberts rebellion is an option but I think Dunk And Egg would make the most sense."
gameofthrones,3e317i,ERMAHGERSHREDDERT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"Right.  Dance of the Dragons would probably not happen much, but I'm hoping we at least get to see the entirety of Robert's Rebellion and all the sub plots that revolve around it as well as Dunk and Egg.    I do agree and I have considered the fact that literally the show must go on because these actors have other things to do and can't just wait around, especially as they grow older for characters that are already aged much further than they are in the source material."

Dany thought it was like dragon fire, cersei saw Lannisters red, Melisandre said it was a sign from the Lord of Light.

A god has it's own ideas, magic doesn't. A god might want sacrifices or devotion. Magic can be used by anyone who knows how. That's the difference. I think that's why Thoros is a shitty priest to his 'god', but he stumbled across blood/fire magic in the form of resurrection. Also why Mel's burnings of people are totally unnecessary. There is no god, and even a little blood works."

I think it's more likely that Melisandre predicted their deaths or saw them in the flames and performed the charade with the leeches to strengthen Stannis' belief in her and R'hllor's power.  Otherwise, why didn't she just repeatedly use a tiny bit of leeched blood from Gendry/Edric, Shireen or even Stannis himself to gain the Lord of Light's favour/cast blood magic?"

From Mel we hear that they're are only two gods in the world, one of Fire and light, supposedly standing for greater good of the living (""Fiery Lord of Light""), and one of cold and death, working for the Others (""The Great Other"").  The ""Fiery Lord of Light"" is one of the few beings that uses magic to help people; this is seen when Ser Beric Dondarrion is brought back to life SIX times by the Red Priestess Thoros of Myr. We see him die on screen, and brought back to life in the same episode. Those are REAL examples of miracles (magic), even if you don't believe in his other powers, the power to resurrect is something that will become more and more important in the series, especially in the coming seasons.   Still better than the faith of the Seven which has done nigh nothing to make a physical presence in the world."

gameofthrones,3dyy1q,brix_shat,4,Tue Jul 21 08:21:56 2015 UTC,"Since this thread is marked as ""all"" I can clear this up for you. In AFFC he is super strongly implied to be in recovery living as a peaceful monk who has taken a vow of silence on an island near where he was left for dead. Many people think this means he will come back, and while I would enjoy this I think the ending his character currently has of being presumed dead by the world at large and finally breaking free of the violence that has defined his life is a fitting and consistent end for the character. As of right now, Sandor is one of the only characters to have a peaceful conclusion to their story.   Of course it's also possible that Martin is setting up the man we met as an amoral ugly monster to fight as a holy warrior against the reanimated corpse of his evil sadistic brother to decide Cersei's fate. That's the ""cleganebowl"" theory. It's merit comes from the fact that Sandor is now aligned with the faith of the seven.... but he's also not at Kings Landing and not part of the ""sparrow"" movement so we'll see if it actually happens."

It goes:   The Ordinary World: The Hero is introduced sympathetically in his natural habitat. This world is all he's ever known - Jon is introduced as the bastard of Winterfell. He's never know another home, but he still doesn't feel like he belongs there. The Call to Adventure: Something changes the situation, and the Hero feels the need to leave his ordinary world - Benjen arrives at Winterfell, Jon wants to join him at the Wall. Crossing the Threshold: The Hero leaves the ordinary world and enters an unfamiliar (and dangerous) place - Jon arrives at the Wall, makes friends and enemies, learns what it actually means to be a black brother. The Supernatural Aid/Mentor: The Hero is given aid in the form of a supernatural object and/or a (usually old) wise man or mentor - Jon gets both of these. His ""Supernatural"" aids are Ghost and Longclaw, and he finds mentors in both Aemon and the Old Bear. Challenges and Temptations: The Hero is tested and must decide where his allegiances lie - The Night's Watch rides out in the great ranging, and Jon gets captured by Mance's wildlings. He falls in love and, although tempted to stay, he decides to return to Castle Black. The Abyss: The Hero reaches his darkest hour. Nothing will ever be the same again - This is where we are now. His brothers have betrayed him, and left him for dead. All seems lost, but luckily the next step is... Rebirth: The Hero escapes the abyss and is reborn, realizing his true purpose and/or his destiny - Jon will somehow come back, and death will have presumably released him from his vows. This is convenient, as he has somehow (Bran vision? Something else?) learned the truth of his parentage (R+L=J)   Anything much further would be total speculation, but it's easy to see how the monomyth fits Jon's story. Nearly every story that has ever been written is encapsulated by the monomyth though, so that's no surprise. It'll be interesting to see if GrrM completes the monomyth cycle, or if he purposefully switches it up to subvert the status quo."
gameofthrones,3dzv71,DatClubbaLang96,3,Tue Jul 21 01:00:59 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling Arya is going for the second lap. Her first reborn happened around the time she left Hound. Before that   The Ordinary World   Winterfell   The Call to Adventure Crossing the Threshold   Moving to King's Landing with her father and his execution   The Supernatural Aid/Mentor   First appearance of Sexy Jesus, he kills guards.   Challenges and Temptations   A lot happened, in particular she has to trick Tywin to survive.   The Abyss   Red Wedding.   Rebirth   Hound was on her kill list. But she did not kill him. That completes her 1st reborn.   Also this ends The Ordinary World of her second cycle.   The Call to Adventure Crossing the Threshold   With no Hound, she moves to Braavos   The Supernatural Aid/Mentor   where she meets with Sexy Jesus again   Challenges and Temptations:   She failed to her temptation with Needle and Meryn Trant.    The Abyss   She lost her sight as result of it   Rebirth   IIRC from spoilers, in books she wargs into cats and dogs to see.  It didn't happen in show, but it will be the end of her 2nd rebirth."
gameofthrones,3dzv71,GrayGreyMoralityFan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:52:56 2015 UTC,"Meryn Trant???   She failed at dissociating herself from her original identity as Arya Stark, as evidenced when she killed Dareon for deserting the Night's Watch and told the Dude at the House of B&W that Arya Stark did it.  Pretty sure that is why she lost her sight.  Regardless though, I don't believe she goes through two cycles at all.  The Red Wedding was just the start of the Death stage, and it ended with the death of Sandor Clegane. As such, her trip to Braavos and what played out there represents her journey through the Underworld... the dissociation of her identity, etc.  She hasn't got as far as Rebirth yet."

(could be he was born into a noble family) Withdrawal from family or community for meditation and preparation. - Taking the Black (Nights Watch) Trial and Quest. - Quest was to go to the north.

Aerys II was clearly suffering from PTSD from whatever happened at Duskendale, and the people he accused of plotting against him...actually were. His only mistake was alienating Tywin, who could have swung the war decidedly into Targ favor.  Same goes for Viserys. He was prideful, wrathful, cutthroat, and impatient, but wouldn't anyone be when raised under the same conditions as he was?  Rhaegar was just a man who made the wrong enemy. When I think about the Trident, I imagine him trying to talk Robert down, completely unaware that the murder of Starks and kidnap of Lyanna was just a pretext for rebellion, and not the actual cause.  Even Maegor the Cruel was probably a good and noble king, given the only facts we have about him are given to us by those he attempted to crush. In fact, it's likely that the Targ penchant for madness is actually entirely an invention of the Citadel played up to help sow dissent and speed the fall of a House already standing on its last legs."

gameofthrones,3e191q,yolostyle,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:18 2015 UTC,"Take the Mad King Aerys for example. He wasn't crazy when he began his rule   I disagree. I think he was crazy, but it wasn't as blatantly obvious since he was handsome and charismatic. From The World of Ice and Fire:   Though not the most diligent of princes, nor the most intelligent, he had an undeniable charm that won him many friends. He was also vain, proud, and changeable, traits that made him easy prey for flatterers and lickspittles, but these flaws were not immediately apparent to most at the time of his ascension.   I think Aerys' ""changeable"" nature was an aspect of his insanity. His emotions would take wild swings, he was prone to falling in and out of love within short periods of time, and he started (or at least pledged to start) and abandoned massive projects at the same rate he started and abandoned relationships.   Aerys II always seemed to lose interest in his lovers quickly. Many lasted no longer than a fortnight, and few as long as half a year.  His grace was full of grand schemes as well. Not long after his coronation, he announced his intent to conqueror the Stepstones and make them a part of his realm for all time. In 264 AC, a visit to King's Landing by Lord Rickard Stark of Winterfell awakened his interest in the North, and he hatched a plan to build a new Wall a hundred leagues north of the existing one and claim all the lands in between. In 265 AC, offended by ""the stink of King's Landing,"" he spoke of building a ""white city"" entirely of marble on the south bank of the Blackwater Rush. In 267 AC, after a dispute with his with the Iron Bank of Braavos regarding certain monies borrowed by his father, he announced he would build the largest war fleet in the history of the world to ""bring the Titan to his knees."" In 270 AC, during a visit to Sunspear, he told the Princess of Dorne that he would ""make the Dornish deserts bloom"" by digging a great underground canal beneath the mountains to bring water down from the rainwood.  None of these grandiose plans ever came to fruition; most indeed were forgotten before a moon's turn, for Aerys II seemed to grow bored with his royal enthusiasms as quickly as he did his royal paramours.   So many delusions of grandeur and changes of heart hardly seem like attributes of a particularly sane individual. I agree with OP that the Defiance of Duskendale was what pushed him over the edge, but he had already been nudged towards it for some time due to his natural inclination towards madness and the lies told to him by the flatterers he surrounded himself with, who tried to use his paranoia to manipulate him. Another string of events that fueled his paranoia were the many miscarriages his queen and sister Rhaella had.   At first His Grace comforted Rhaella in her grief, but over time his compassion turned to suspicion. By 270 AC, he had decided that the queen was being unfaithful to him. ""The gods will not suffer a bastard to sit the Iron Throne,"" he told the small council; none of Rhaella's still-births, miscarriages, or dead princes had been his, the king proclaimed. Thereafter, he forbade the queen to leave the confines of Maegor's Holdfast and decreed that two septas would henceforth share her bed every night, ""to see that she remains true to her vows.""   Aerys also began to grow paranoid of his old friend and Hand, Tywin Lannister, when people started to say that it was really Tywin who ruled the realm. By 268 AC, Aerys would do the exact opposite of whatever Tywin recommended. By the time Viserys was born in 276 AC, Aerys was so paranoid that he made his royal food taster suck milk from the breast the baby prince would drink from to make sure it wasn't poisoned. No one was allowed to touch Viserys without the king's permission, and not even the queen was allowed to be alone with him.  Oh right, OP's post wasn't entirely about Aerys. I'll make this quick since this post is already pretty long.  Viserys: Totally agree with OP on this one. I personally think it was a miracle, even without the factor of Targ madness, that Viserys was kind to Dany for as long as he was given his fucked up childhood. Remember, Viserys wasn't allowed to be touched as a baby, grew up with an ultra-paranoid father, and then spent the rest of his life in exile with the fear of assassination.  Rhaegar: OP's reasoning for calling Rhaegar insane is that he had delusions of grandeur that he was The Prince that was Promised, but Rhaegar's beliefs seem more valid when one remembers House Targaryen's history with prophecy. There have been several Targaryens throughout history who had the ability to see the future in their dreams, and the only reason House Targaryen even exists is because Daenys the Dreamer had a vision that Valyria would be destroyed. On her word alone, her family packed their bags, sold their fertile land in Valyria, moved to gloomy Dragonstone, and eventually conquered Westeros with the only dragons left in the world. You can see why Rhaegar might put his faith in prophecy. In addition to that, Rhaegar also fulfills several requirements for TPTWP, which he would have discovered in those books he was so fond of. He was born beneath a red star (the red comet) amidst salt and smoke (the smoke from the fires of Summerhall, the salt from the tears mourning those who died there).  tl;dr: Aerys was way crazy before the Defiance in 277 AC, Viserys had a childhood that could drive anyone crazy, and Rhaegar had a few reasons to believe in his delusions of grandeur without being crazy."

He wouldn't go to the wall to defend the realm, not only doesn't he care about the people of Westeros, but he despises them if anything for wronging him (not taking his side).

If Jon Snow leaves the wall, which he will considering they all killed the shit out of him, that leaves no PoV at the wall right when it seems like we'd need one the most.   Brianne is an honorable person and killing an injured man in a revenge kill seems out of character, I can totally see her allowing Stannis to take the black for his crimes against her king (I think her claims bullshit but thats irrelevant to her mindset). Maybe Stannis isn't Azor Ahai but hes lived the last few years of his life believing it was his job to save the world from the white walkers, not to mention his entire family and house are wiped out except for his skeleton force at Dragonstone ( in the books he doesn't even have that anymore ) so he doesn't really have a reason to decline.   He could also be dead because it does feel like a cop out if he isn't but come on, they show almost every character in the show gratuitously murdered/raped. I can't think of a single reason why they wouldn't show Stannis get beheaded. Especially since Brianne has the reforged Ice which is the same sword that beheaded Ned. It just seems cheap to fade to black instead of showing the actual ending to one of the most major plotlines in the story."

Bran and Rickon were reported dead, but all reports of doing so were second hand, with the POV of Theon doing the deed copiously absent. The death of Davos at White Harbor was also hearsay, with the POV not experiencing a death and of course Davos being in fact alive and well in Manderly's custody."

Stannis fans believe he's alive because they want him to be alive.  When you look at it logically though, it's Stannis haters writing the episodes.  They aren't going to extend Stannis' presence in the series.  They have no reason to.  They are not looking forward to Badass Stannis at the wall versus the walkers.  They are happy he is dead, so he is staying that way."

Because Robert would have thought Stannis was just trying to further advance himself in the life of succession. In the books, Stannis is the one who originally begins to investigate Robert's bastards and discovers the truth of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen's actual parentage. He brings these suspicions to Jon Arryn because he thinks that Robert is much more likely to believe it coming from Jon. Unfortunately, Jon is secretly poisoned and killed before he can tell Robert anything, so Stannis is forced to flee to Dragonstone because he assumes the Lannisters were the ones who murdered Jon for digging too deep, even though that wasn't really the case."
gameofthrones,3dyjkm,PlzGiveMeVCThx,2,Mon Jul 20 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"Go further back than that: Why didn't Stannis side with the Mad King during Robert's Rebellion?  Siding with Robert means Stannis gets nothing if Robert wins (He could not have known Robert would take the throne and Storm's End would become available), and if Robert loses, he's dead.  On the other hand, if he sides with the Mad King, he gets everything Robert has if Robert loses, and if Robert wins, no big deal, Robert isn't going to kill Stannis."

gameofthrones,3dyjkm,bat-affleck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Stannis has always operated against his self-interest to do what he believed was right.  I may not agree with his assessment of what the right thing is, but I do recognize that he's trying his best."

He gets into his head this idea that he's supposed to be king and everything else- including his own happiness- takes second place to that obsession.  He has moral complexity in the same sense that MacBeth does. Stannis's arc isn't the story of a morally mixed character walking a balance, it's the story of a man's obsessing dragging him into damnation."

Of all he actual claimants to the Iron Throne, he is/was by far the most competent (though Tommen and Dany could mature into decent rulers)."
gameofthrones,3dyjkm,TheRobbyStark,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:56:51 2015 UTC,We know. We fucking know Stannis is dead. It would make no sense plot-wise to keep him alive.

If they had killed Tyrion after joffery, you could apply the exact same logic. He failed, had nothing left to do. He wasn't hand anymore, and his family disowned him. He's dead, we know he's dead.  But he didn't die, and now he's off doing other things. Is stannis dead? Maybe, perhaps even probably. But not showing it left the possibility open, and they know that.

gameofthrones,3dyjkm,hugeveinycock,5,Tue Jul 21 03:33:34 2015 UTC,"TINFOIL TIME: I actually believe that he is alive and, while taking a seemingly divergent path, I believe that the book/television storylines may end up merging sometime next season/book. I'll start with where the book/television character's current situation and where I believe his arc is headed.  For book Stannis, he is currently gearing up for a war with the Boltons. At the same time, Jon receives a letter informing him of Stannis' demise. It is important to note that Stannis' daughter Shireen and Melisandre are still at Castle Black. Believing that Stannis is Azor Ahai, she will burn Shireen as an offering to the Lord of Light in hopes that Stannis will become reborn. However, as almost all GoT fans suspect at this point, Jon Snow will be the one to come back after having been murdered by Bowen Marsh and other members of the Night's Watch. Relieved of his duties as Lord Commander, Snow sets forth on a new path to recruit as many men as possible to gear up for a fight against the Others.   As for Stannis, be his fight successful or not, he will return to Castle Black to find out that his daughter was sacrificed to the Lord of Light and that he is not Azor Ahai. With no apparent heir to carry on the Baratheon bloodline, Stannis sees that his efforts to win the throne are useless and takes the Black.  Back at the Wall, the death of Snow means that there is now an opening for the 999th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, most likely Marsh. Stannis will not likely be at the Wall by the time they elect a new Lord Commander, so why did GRRM make the number so close to 1,000? If I had to speculate, I would guess that the 1,000th will probably be someone prominent and complete legendary deeds. Knowing what everyone knows about Stannis' prowess as a military tactician as well as his role in saving the Night's Watch from certain destruction, should the 999th Lord Commander met his untimely end, I'd say that Stannis chances of being elected the 1,000 Lord Commander are pretty good.  For the television series theory, while I hate the way D&D gets there, it has the same ultimate result. I believe that Breanne was distracted by Sansa and Theon before she could complete her swing. Wanting to ensure Sansa's safety, Breanne reasons that taking her to Castle Black to Jon is the best course of action. In exchange for his life, Stannis will agree to help transport them to the Wall.   Because he no longer has an army to fight for him (or a daughter to put on the throne), Stannis agrees to take the Black and deal with the real threat facing humanity -- the White Walkers. Once again, the Night's Watch will likely vote in a new 999th Lord Commander before he gets to the Wall (likely Sir Thorne), ensuring that Stannis would be available as the 1,000th Lord Commander should there be an opening. Again, it takes a roundabout course, but this theory ends in the same place. I don't think Stannis' story is finished just yet.  On a lesser tinfoil note, I believe that Stannis' sword Lightbringer will live up to its name after Stannis plunges it into the heart of Melisandre.  TL;DR - Stannis becomes the 1,000th Lord Commander"
gameofthrones,3dyjkm,chrisdelbosque,2,Tue Jul 21 00:39:30 2015 UTC,"I hope Thorne becomes the 999th, just to have Jon comeback and bury Longclaw in his ribcage."

""If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.""  I love Stannis as a character. I wish he'd have gone out on a better note (or at least taken someone from The Invincible Bolton's and Frey's with him). But he is dead. His show arc ended. There is nothing left for him, he's lost everything, his family is completely gone, and sparing him to send him to the Wall is a pointless fake out of a major character death. Which, by the way, would be two major character deaths in the season finale that would end up being fake-outs. That completely cheapens the concept of someone dying in the show.  Stannis Baratheon is dead in the show. House Baratheon is extinct, save for Gendry paddling that boat. Theirs was the fury."

That completely cheapens the concept of someone dying in the show.   I hear that a lot, but I'm currently rereading the books and am surprised at just how many chapters end with a major character seemingly dead. GRRM loves a good fake-out death almost as much as he loves the real thing.   So I wouldn't be particularly surprised if Stannis death was a fake-out and Jon's death was real but temporary.  Also outside of the works of GRRM, it was a tv season finale.  Shows often end their season finales with various major characters in seemingly unsurvivable situations.   Fairly sure Myrcella is dead though."

The results are the same; the TV audience is meant to believe a character is gone for good and then suddenly, be it through magic and prophesy or the timely arrival of a distracting Sansa, we find out that said character is around for more. The two biggest characters that died in the season finale reappearing would be, I think, cheap.  But we're all entitled to our likes and dislikes."

When I watched seasons 4 and 5, however, I started to like him. He was reasonable and likeable in the show. And then S5E9 happened and I went right back to where I started. I have no idea where all of this ""D&D hate Stannis he's a good and noble man"" shit comes from. If anything, they elevated him from what he was in the books. And now his story has ended in a logical and poetic way."

But these words - and only these words - could've stayed Brienne's hand.  Think about it: Brienne is the most noble and loyal character in the entire series... to a fault.  Just like Ned Stark, she's not made to exist in a world with this level of treachery.   Brienne's duty was to protect Renly: she failed.  Brienne's duty was to trade the Kingslayer for the Stark sisters: she failed.  Brienne's duty was to rescue Sansa.  She's failed that too... so far.  The very last oath Brienne can possibly keep is to help Sansa.  And right now, at Winterfell, it's two against hundreds.  Brienne knows this.  She's tormented by it.  And that's why when Stannis says ""Do your duty"", it's a stark reminder (yes, intentional) that she has yet to fulfill a SINGLE FUCKING OATH.  And her blade is named Oathkeeper, for shit's sake!  It's for this reason Brienne strikes above the Mannis's head.  Maybe she saw the light in the tower window, or maybe she didn't... either way, she needs Stannis.  She needs anyone, really, and if the Mannis has any men left, or power left, or ideas left in his skull, Brienne is going to use those resources to help get Sansa back.  TLDR: Brienne's long-standing promise to save Sansa supercedes even her own thirst for vengeance; for once in the series, she actually makes the right move.   Percent chance the Mannis is alive: 89.63%  EDIT:  Also, two more things:  1) In the books, the Mannis yet lives.  2) If anyone is going to kill Melisandre, it's Stannis."
gameofthrones,3dyjkm,shakakka99,4,Mon Jul 20 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, you are wrong.  Brienne swore an oath to Catelyn, BUT, she also said ""Promise me you won't hold me back from Stannis.""

She needs anyone, really, and if the Mannis has any men left, or power left, or ideas left in his skull, Brienne is going to use those resources to help get Sansa back.   Honestly, I have no idea where you are getting this from.  What does Stannis possibly have to offer Brienne?  He has no men, no supporters, and he's mortally wounded.  If anything he is a liability.  She was prepared to rescue Sansa by herself before this all happened, so what changed?  Let's say you're right, and Stannis saying ""Do your duty"" reminded her that she needs to help Sansa.  Why does that prompt her to miss on purpose?  Stannis is down for the count, and this is the chance to avenge her king.  She swung the sword, why not kill him?  It doesn't make sense.  She can still kill Stannis (fulfilling her promise to kill him) and then go help Sansa.  I don't understand this idea that she can't save Sansa and get revenge at the same time."

I'm really impressed. ;p  Back on task, the man is dead. Even if the show doesnt follow the books, the houses in the North told Stannis to get fucked, he's in a bad spot weather-wise, even if he somehow defeats Ramsay (who is riding out to meet him) he still has to take Winterfell, and the North already has gone after Rickon to set him up as heir, and Stannis is still waiting on sell swords to join him.

Jon was good natured even if a bit sullen about his place in life, and Tyrion just sort of helped him accept it a bit.  Theon on the other hand was remarkably cavalier over what must have been horrifying deaths.  Seems like Tyrion was just reminding him what he was and why he was there.  His father and uncles had rebelled against the king, and that's why Theon was there.  Had Theon not glorified the deaths of probably countless thousands I really doubt Tyrion would have so sharply reminded him it lead to him being a ward-not by choice.

Tywin arrives with his army claiming to be in defense of the city.   Aerys let's Tywin in despite Varys protests.  Tywin's army starts ransacking the city and marching towards the Red Keep.  Aerys tells Jaime to kill his father and lead the defense of the city to repel Tywin.  Here's where the assumption comes in: People assume (and rightfully so) that faced with this choice Jaime chose family over duty (a reoccurring theme in the series) and stabs Aerys in the back, literally.  Now with his King dead and his vows forsaken he sits the Iron Throne awaiting who will come to claim it. That person was Ned, whose army arrived shortly after Tywin's.  No one ever considers that Jaime made a morally just decision, and had good reason to kill Aerys. The stain of being an oathbreaker of the highest calibre was enough that no one looked further into what really happened."
gameofthrones,3e0hhr,Lord_NiteShade,12,Tue Jul 21 02:02:14 2015 UTC,"You know, that's the thing, how the hell is it so confusing to everyone that Jaime may have had a good reason to kill Aerys? It almost seems like a foreign idea that, just maybe, the crazy guy who had spent years torturing and burning his enemies to death might, just might, need to be put down for the good of the realm."
gameofthrones,3e0hhr,Rosebunse,11,Tue Jul 21 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"the crazy guy who had spent years torturing and burning his enemies to death might, just might, need to be put down for the good of the realm.   The problem is Jaime was exact opposite person to do it. He had a vow to keep, and vows are sacred. Vows are what keep the feudal contract intact. Vows are the reasons vassals can rely on their liege for protection, and lieges rely on vassals for wealth and support.   Had Ned arrived and delivered northern justice with Ice, that would have been a just act.  Had Tywin put the Red Keep to the sword and butchered Aerys and his entire household, that would have been a just act.  But Jaime, the one man in the city who is sworn to protect Aerys drives a golden blade through his heart, whatever the reason that was the man he swore a vow to protect. It was an unjust act."
gameofthrones,3e0hhr,Lord_NiteShade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:18:22 2015 UTC,"Doing partial bad and partial good is definitively more just than doing all bad and no good. Swearing an oath to protect the Mad King was bad for the realm. Killing him was good for the realm. Jaime would have been consistent in keeping his oath, but it would have been consistent with a bad choice for the realm. We erroneously see consistency as a positive trait. Jaime realized keeping his oath in that moment would be bad for the realm, so he corrected his mistake rather than being consistent for consistency's sake."

gameofthrones,3e0hhr,howisaraven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"Jaime had remained loyal to Aerys despite all the stuff he did (having the Starks killed, ripping Ilyn Payne's tongue out...), right until the moment it was absolutely certain the loyalists were the losing side.

gameofthrones,3dzix3,RangoHD,105,Mon Jul 20 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"Jaime is one of the best characters in the series because he's a complicated character. The beauty of this question is that there is no answer. He does honorable, even heroic things like save Brienne from the bear, and despicable things like push Bran. Not only that, but he is always changing and learning, particularly after being humbled by losing his hand. But since it's fun to debate answerless questions: I think Jaime is the man, and he would be well suited for the throne. Especially since he's less hotheaded now. I really hope he makes it"
gameofthrones,3dzix3,TheDOdoubleG,40,Mon Jul 20 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"His most heroic thing? Probably saving a city from mad king, but it seems that nobody except Brienne know true"
gameofthrones,3dzix3,Arrioso,33,Mon Jul 20 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"He suffered from the same case of voluntary self damning silence that Jon does.  ""Guys i know you all think i am a huge dick and some of you see me as nothing more than a traitor for what i have done but here is what happened and i think you will agree my actions were justified""  Jaime when he was discovered by Ned was sitting on the throne and basically bragging, if he had shown the tiniest bit of remorse for having to break his vows and explained why he did it then Ned would probably have backed him up.  Jon if he had just told Thorne and the rest of the Nights Watch what had happened at Hardhome with witness testimony from Edd and the other NW survivors to back him up... he too could have avoided what happened to him. Instead he only apparently tells Sam who is in the process of leaving the area entirely and keeps everybody else in the dark."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,DougyAM,11,Mon Jul 20 22:06:10 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, Jaime at that time was a pretty arrogant dude who believed (rightly) he had just done everyone a favour. Cue The Honourable Ned Stark finding some brat who'd murdered the King lounging on the throne and it's his word vs Jaime's. That moment you could really see changing Jaime's worldview and sense of honour.   Comparing this with another interesting character like the Hound, you can see 'honour' and 'duty' often meaning acting at the whims of a mad or cruel lord and being rewarded for it with offers of knighthood and fame. 'Duty' in those times often meant serving your lord at all times no matter what.   I really like his character and how complicated he is, probably my favourite outside of Tyrion at this stage. The arc with Brienne and in particular the bath scene is brilliant seeing this other side to a previously pretty despicable character."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,Frankly109,6,Mon Jul 20 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"He's probably one of the best examples of personal growth in the show. They don't really address this on screen but Jaime is dyslectic, there's a couple of instances where the bring up his struggle to read and write growing up. Because of this his identity was heavily built around his skill as a fighter and his prestigious family. He's added to the Kings guard as a slight to Tywin and grows up thinking he's above everyone else because he's basically living the life of a hero from some song.   After he looses his hand and his family falls apart he basically has to reinvent himself as a kinder, more humble person which is why most people like new Jaime."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,CaptainChats,8,Tue Jul 21 00:21:46 2015 UTC,"he too could have avoided what happened to him.    Not necessarily. While I do feel that the showrunners should have at least have him attempt to explain the Hardhome event, it doesn't mean it'll save him in the long run.   People in this sub-reddit have the perception that Jon telling them about Hardhome would somehow make Alliser and his followers magically more open-minded and accepting of the Wildings. Remember that Jon essentially brought the same exact point about the threat of the White Walkers prior to Hardhome and it was met with vocal rejection and disdain. The NW's watch aren't the most objective thinkers when it comes to the wildings, they just don't trust them.  The NW in general are aware of Wights and White Walkers, season 2 finale, the wight that tried to kill Mormont  in season 1, the NW in the show are more aware of WW and Wights than the book NW. So it's not really that they don't see WW as threats, it's more along the lines of distrusting the wildings.  It's akin to Jews asking Nazis to help fend off a zombie apocalypse, sure some of them may put differences aside but they are have understandble reservations teaming up with such people. The NW and Wildings have a similar history.  The small minded NW's members still would have carried out the stabbing."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,YoYoSun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The Night's Watch have viewed for centuries the wildlings as the enemy (and vise-versa), and when that worldview gets ingrained for as long as it has, it's hard to get people to overcome that and see the big picture."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,grindyoursoul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:39:43 2015 UTC,"No explaining would save Jon Snow, they know the white walkers are a threat but they feel too much hate against the wildlings. They just fought a war against them and many of their brothers were killed in that war. Anything anyone that left to that expedition could have been bunched up as a wildling lover or being brainwashed by Jon Snow on the trip. Everyone on the wall lives each day indoctrinated on hating the wildling and effective ways of killing them, logic cant get to them especially after the shock of war.  Jaime also isnt redeemable on Ned's eyes. Breaking your vows and back stabbing your sworn to protect king isnt a option, ever. Jaime could have knocked him out, locked him down by force or done non lethal wounds. Losing your honor to save your hide is a thing Ned will never stand by, remember he wanted to just die before admitting to his treason. Only after Varys pushed his father love buttons did he forgo his honor, as Aemon said, love is the death of duty. Only Ned love for his daughters could trump his honor and even then he would have probably accepted to live a life of shame."

gameofthrones,3dzix3,insanePowerMe,0,Tue Jul 21 11:56:57 2015 UTC,"Killing the children is not the right thing to do, when a king starts killing children because he is afraid they will take his throne in 10-15 years, you might not be fit to rule. Robert admitted to Ned, that he shouldnt have sent a assassin to kill them, they are children caught in the crossfire.   I have no doubts Jaime would kill the children because his morals are fucked up, just like he told Cat when he was a prisoner, he doesn't really value human life, they are all just meat balloons filled with blood or something like that.  Someone like that isnt meant to rule"

Like you can see now, Robert disaster comes from two facts. Daenarys and her brother were alive and are planning to invade Westeros with a huge army. Dorne is planning to support them and rebel against the throne. Stannis and his younger brother started the war because Ned was too nice to execute Cersei and her 3 incest bastards. If ned was cruel enough to kill joffrey tommen and myrcella, there would be no long war and chaos. Also Ned died for being too nice.   They might not be your Heroes these children killers, but they are the savior of the realm Westeros desperately needs. Someone who is cruel enough to do what needs to be done but kind enough to rule the common people with fairness and protection."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,insanePowerMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"Daenarys and her brother were alive and are planning to invade Westeros with a huge army   Her brother has no way to get anything and unless you arent remembering, its those assassinations attempts that fuel Drogo's rage to try and go do war on them. Had they heard Ned and not tried to kill her, Drogo would never go as far as to cross the narrow sea. He had no reason to cross the sea to die, fighting a war against castles and siege weapons they do not know how to fight against.   If ned was cruel enough to kill joffrey tommen and myrcella, there would be no long war and chaos. Also Ned died for being too nice.   Again killing children in their sleep is not the answer, Ned had 20 ways do deal with that situation and you choose the worst one. He could have easily solved this by giving the throne to Renly, which offered enough man power to secure their safety, or simply by bribing Littlefinger, which controlled the city watch. And none of this would have happened if Robbert didnt got killed in the hunting expedition, him getting killed there just because he was drunk its extremely unlucky for Ned.  There was going to be the same war with Ned alive, he was going to make Stannis king. Which means Renly still rises his army against him. Which is the reason Littlefinger betrays him.   They might not be your Heroes these children killers, but they are the savior of the realm Westeros desperately needs.    That is just excuses murderers use to feel a bit more safe at night, killing everyone that you think might pose a threat later will just end up creating the enemies you are trying to prevent. Like it did with Drogo."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,Gammaran,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"I can see and understand why you feel anger for crimes like killing innocent children just because they are born as the son of a king.  Is vyserys capable of taking the throne? Probably not. Is Drogo interested at Westeros? Probably not. But what if?   Dorne, Iron isles and many more lords are crazily unhappy with the lannisters and baratheon. In the books, dorne is attempting to ally with Targaryans. Iron isles greyjoy are sending ships to daenarys to ally with daenarys.   Daenarys could still be the useless child and not queen of mereen but the rebelling houses would still try to get her for the sake of name Targaryan.   Do you know about the Targaryan tree Blackfyre? They rebelled against Targaryan in the past. They lost and flew to Essos. Targaryan lost all dragons and a lot of power because they had to fight the Blackfyre over and over. Th Blackfyre always tried to use a child or grow up ""Targaryan-blooded"" man to gain the throne. If the Targaryan had the chance they would have executed every child from blackfyre. They are the reason why baratheon could take the throne. Targaryan lost power and all dragons fighting people who supported children and grown up children.   There numorous example in the real history where some child long forgotten are founded by rebels and are used to start a war against the king or emporer. And some of them succeeded. Some not. After all many thousands of people died because that child was found and some powerful lord used his name."

Han dynasty of china ruled for over400 years peacefully, after the emperor all opponents are killed preemtively. might it be a general or a child of the former emperor. npt saying who did it, obviously hiding the fact who did it is the clever way to prevent people from thinking your emperor is too cruel and unjustice. result 400 years of peace.  The frankish emperor (german/france) splitted his empire into three kingdoms for his 3 kids. germany, franken and another kingdom including parts of italy. the result? these three kingdoms went to war beside being brothers. result: germany, franken survived, the other one not.  it is easy for people like you and me to say, lets spare the life of this guy. But if you are in the position after a long hard fought fight, and the result is you might have to fight again and put your wife, your mother, your son and daughter in danger of  being raped and slaughtered like the Mountain raped and slaughter Oberyn Martell's sister and nieces... what would you do? go the safer route and secure a safer life for your kids and wife or go the dangerous route just to be moraly innocent.  whether you choose killing the enemy or ""killing"" your own children by not securing their safety. neither is wrong or right. only history will know if you have chosen the correct way"
gameofthrones,3dzix3,insanePowerMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"result 400 years of peace.   There is no way to say that 400 years of peace couldnt have been reached or more by not killing all those people. Not all kingdoms are built on this principle. And more importantly it always works, until it doesnt. You would be naive to think that the only reason the kingdom had peace was because of that, there is a whole geopolitical landscape with thousands of little details fighting each other daily that affect a kingdom's peace. Kill children doesnt = peace forever. Its one way to go at things, and one small detail of the huge cosmos ruling a kingdom is.  Also its silly for you to try to make me cite places where it worked, when history is written by the one that lives after the fights, especially in ancient history. All the ploys, betrayals, murdering there is behind every successful kingdom isnt on the books. Justice in history is only a mere point of view and most events arent recorded, only the ones that made it to the light of public.   whether you choose killing the enemy or ""killing"" your own children by not securing their safety. neither is wrong or right. only history will know if you have chosen the correct way   lol, interesting example you bring with Oberynn sister, then you would be agreeing with justifying when Joffrey killed Ned. I mean to Joffrey the current king Ned is a traitor and is plotting against the crown, he should be killed too. Yet that fuels more to the war.   As i said there is no right answer to ruling a country, much less a kingdom. Assuming you have the answers, with no experience ruling or with politics is just foolishness and the fact that you thing the foolproof way to rule is just kill any children that might pose a threat is also absurd"

gameofthrones,3dzix3,chandat4,18,Tue Jul 21 08:24:00 2015 UTC,"I think that Jaime has my favorite character arc. When we first see him, he is an arrogant good looking kings guard who throws a little boy out of a window intending to kill him. How could I ever grow to like this guy? Scenes with him and Ned make me dislike him even more! When is captured by Robb's forces he even kills his own kin. Jaime at this point is clearly not a good person.   What I like about Jaime is his road to redemption. You can see him starting to become a better person with Brienene, but even then he pokes at her and calls her ugly a couple times. When is captured by the Boltons is when he starts his redemption. He thinks that his money can help him, but soon realizes that money and names aren't everything when he loses his sword hand. When Jaime loses his hand, that is the beginning of his humbling.   The scene in the bath with Brienne is a great character building scene. He tells his side of the kingslaying story, and you realize that not all of what he has done was wrong. One scene that really made me respect the fuck out of Jaime is when he doesn't accept the milk of the poppy when Qyburn is nurturing his stub. That really makes me believe that he honestly believes he deserved what happened to him.   Fast forward to the scene where he goes into the pit with a BEAR to save Brienne with only one hand. That is ballysy, and honorable. IMO, Jaime is a character who I wouldn't classify as good or bad, because he is both. At this point in the story he is a morally improved man who has sought redemption, and is on his path to becoming a great man. His deeds in the past will never e forgotten, but he can only do so much to save his reputation.   Basically, as OP states no character is ""wholly good or evil"" and I think that Jaime Lannister is a prime example of this."

gameofthrones,3dzix3,Draki1903,2,Tue Jul 21 11:16:25 2015 UTC,"Good points, however the reason Jaime chose not to accept milk of the poppy was because he feared if he fell unconscious Qyburn would amputate his arm which was against his wishes.

gameofthrones,3dzix3,Moyeslestable,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea actually, hadn't thought of that point. I think Cersei's speech during the act though is pretty convincing that it's consensual. I'd have to re-read to be sure though."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,h00nKing,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:33:29 2015 UTC,"It really was such a bad scene. In fact, it was just demeaning."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,Rosebunse,4,Tue Jul 21 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way; Jamie saved an entire city with what he did to the Mad King.  And his reward?  Ridicule.  Servitude.  The loss of any future he might've had with Cersei (no matter how remote the chance), to Robert.  So when he pushed Bran out the window?  Jaime was in ""fuck everyone"" mode.  He's past doing things for the good of everyone else, and more in line with doing what's good for him.  This, in my opinion, makes pushing the kid out the window a LOT less 'evil' overall."

As for the topic itself, I think all that happened is that Jaime went humble, and appreciate life much more from the moment he returned to KL. I guess he also had a taste of being on the flip side of the coin, being the weak one, being abused when he didn't do anything. Just some rambles though."

He did something that any half normal person would do, regardless of status or believes. Even Olly would save the city if he was there instead of Jaime... even Cersei would save the city... even Joffrey... even Melisandre(well maybe not). You get the point. The only good acts from the show so far are his trip to Dorne for his daughter and his support of Tyrion, ie cares for his family which again any normal person would do if they had courage. He has a lot of courage, he is a real warrior - he only needs the desire to do something risky like saving Tyrion. Let aside he was fing his sister, totally fcking over the actual king Robert. Remember what he did to Bran, Ned, his cousin Alton. Now that he is the wounded misunderstood some of you guys give him way more sympathy than he deserves."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,ServiceMonkee,2,Tue Jul 21 09:07:22 2015 UTC,Yeah same thoughts here. When I started watching I didn't like him at all but seeing him develop into a character that actually has feelings unlike Cersei makes me happy.

Whether for right or wrong, he acts impetuously to do what he believes necessary at any given time. He often succeeds in spite of himself, but the consequences keep biting back harder and harder until it robs him of all he held dear. But still, he carries on. Blustering forward blindly is about all he knows, so he keeps doing it. Maybe slowed a bit, but still going."
gameofthrones,3dzix3,Gammaran,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:46 2015 UTC,"Jaime is seen as a good character, but that's because fans are not very good readers.  Jaime is a bad person, who as a result of a mid-life crisis is on some delusional trip about his ""noble redemption arc"" as an unsung hero. He is actually trying to be a good person, but for somewhat vainglorous reasons, and with mixed results, because his methods mostly consist of killing, beating and threatening people. This is vastly more entertaining to read than him actually being a good person.  And sometimes he actually does manage to come close enough to getting it right to do something good and useful while he's at it."

gameofthrones,3dzix3,KR4549,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:43:51 2015 UTC,"imho, Jamie's best quality is that he's one of the only characters (just going from the show because that's all i know) that is extremely honest throughout the series, despite all the shitty things he's done. Of all the characters that do really terrible things he's one of the few that consistently owns up to them when he doesn't have a need to. His is likely (likely because it's not over yet) a story of redemption, and redemption is easy to relate to and for now rare in game of thrones."

Oh - there's the incest and rape thing too - that's all in the family  He killed the King he was charged with protecting - but that was probably a good idea - still - around living up to oaths?

But outside of his relationship with Brienne, Tyrion and Mycerlla - I'm not sure the record says he's a Knight in shining armor.   I was reluctant to use the term ""rape"" because I think it is over-used in the Game of Thrones context but I think the rape scene between Jaime and Cersei - though they were in a long term relationship - is the most rape like scene in the show.   In the cases of Drogon/Daenerys and Ramsey/ Sansa - all participants knew that intercourse was a necessary part of a betrothal that they agreed to (Sansa in particular agreed too).  They never protested - this was what they expected to happen.  But Cersei and Jaime had a ""modern"" relationship based on mutual affection and pleasure and she protested - she said ""no""."

Really, Rhaegar should have usurped his father's throne before he had left. The man was insane and unstable, and no one would have thought less of him for locking the man in a tower.

This is largely played down in the TV show, but it's still there to some extent.  Jon goes out of his way to make Thorne's job harder After going North with Mormont, Jon defects to the enemy, takes a wildling ""wife"", murders his CO, and then comes back and says ""hey, it was a just a trick!"".  This is naturally a very suspicious situation"

gameofthrones,3e0czc,CopperD,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly there is no way to understand who's who and the various relationships between the characters quickly. That's a large part of why it is such a great series.  I've read the books once and watched the show through at least three times as well as reading all of the chapter recap. I still find myself thinking ""who the fuck is that"" regularly.  Try not to worry about it too much and just enjoy not knowing and being surprised. It can be really difficult to do.  Once your done watching you'll probably want to read the books. Then you'll have this problem all over again as the books introduce 100+ more characters but you'll have faces for most of the main ones.   Then once you've read the books watch the show again and read the wiki constantly while watching. Like pause the show and look up whoever your wondering about. Read their back stories. This will tell you their supposed motivation. Well except littlefinger no one know what that guy is doing, like no one.  Then watch all of the Alt Shift X videos then watch all of Preston Jacobs videos  Then read the books again. This is the step I'm about to embark on.  That's the quickest way to know who is who. Sorry there isn't an easier way but don't worry you'll be obsessed by then like most people are.  But really quick: Tyrion the midget, Dany the white haired girl, and Jon the bastard."

There are also individual sections of each territory of Westeros (The Vale, Riverlands, etc.) that include nicely detailed maps and castle descriptions, etc."

gameofthrones,3e0705,Salazar1981,6,Tue Jul 21 06:39:08 2015 UTC,"I understand that the books had a different storyline, and you prefer it. But the show's story made sense as well, just a very different kind of sense.  There is plenty of historical precedent for leaders being killed by their own side, right after making peace with the enemy. That's when the extremists on their side feel most betrayed, and in general leaders worry less about attack from their own side, so it can succeed more easily.  The show also foreshadowed this very well, showing a rising hatred among the men of the Night's Watch for Jon, getting worse and worse. Near the end it was very uncomfortable, then Sam left, and Jon was literally all alone (except for Ghost). When they murdered Jon, it wasn't that surprising, it was more horror and sadness."
gameofthrones,3e0705,therapy,10,Tue Jul 21 02:31:15 2015 UTC,"There is plenty of historical precedent for leaders being killed by their own side, right after making peace with the enemy.   There is.  Unfortunately, this is an adaptation based from a series of novels which gave a MUCH better explanation and motivation from a story-telling point of view. What frustrates book readers (and I was a show watcher before I picked up the novels so I feel both sides) is that there is often no reason for omitting the great storytelling that they do. When they change minor plot points, such as having the Arya and Tywin scenes, the show benefits because they've done so in a competent way.  They are adding something of value.    When you simply eliminate the motivation for a huge plot point, you're strangling the narrative.  We're frustrated because there's no conceivable reason why they couldn't put this in.  It's effortless.   It's literally Jon saying, ""we need to ride against the Boltons"".  And it's important because it's him finally being a selfish character.  That's the key point.  That's the entire point.  Eliminating this is like giving us the Red Wedding and saying, ""It happened because Walder Frey is a bad guy and tricked Robb.""  But that's not the point, that doesn't give you the flavor of the story.  The point is that Robb Stark did this to himself.  He waltzed into Walder's keep with his hot young bride and disrespected a man who was entirely made of ego.  He made a critical error and paid the price for selfish action.  It's that brilliant part of GRRM's writing where you don't see the forest for the trees (just like the characters) until it's over.  What has Jon Snow done that's wrong?  Save some wildlings?  Sowed discontent?  Is that enough to start mutiny?  No. I, and many other fans, don't buy it.  And from a storytelling perspective it whitewashes his character.  We don't get his critical mistake of abandoning his vows.  It creates a situation where this happened to him but not because of him.  And it cheapens one of the best character arcs in the series."
gameofthrones,3e0705,I_want_hard_work,2,Tue Jul 21 06:38:44 2015 UTC,"Coming from the perspective of a show-viewer, I was not surprised by the assassination of Jon Snow by the Night's Watch, and I would have been surprised if Jon had said ""we need to ride against the Boltons"".  Perhaps it's because in the show the murder of Jon was well foreshadowed, and in the books somehow Jon deciding to ride agains the Boltons was well foreshadowed. But it wasn't in the show.  In fact, the opposite - Jon was very clear on being focused on the Wall and his duties there. He has never been selfish, ever. He had many opportunities to be selfish, many of them in this season, and never took them. For him to suddenly ignore the threat of the White Walkers and do something for himself seems totally, bizarrely out of character.  Again, I'm sure in the books it made sense. But in the show, they would have needed to do a lot of work for it to work, and they didn't spend all the time and effort to do it. Jon in the books and Jon in the show are simply different characters, if it made sense for Jon in the books to march against the Boltons.   What has Jon Snow done that's wrong? Save some wildlings? Sowed discontent? Is that enough to start mutiny?   Yes. They watched him walk thousands of their eternal enemies straight through the Wall. It was the ultimate betrayal, from their (narrow and bigoted) perspective. And there was plenty of build-up for it.  One more note - we only see what happened so far. The events of S6 and WoW may justify even more the choices the books made vs. the choices the show made. Perhaps Jon is resurrected in different ways, for example, and has various other large changes in his plot. Maybe Jon being true to his duties in the show is crucial for something later in the show, and maybe Jon being selfish in the books is crucial for something later in the books."
gameofthrones,3e0705,therapy,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"You seem to forget that the Nights Watch is filled to the brim of murderers, rapists, thieves and Little lordlings send to the wall by their father because he didn't want them around (Sorry Sir Piggy)  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that when you try to work out what Jon has done wrong, you must also remember that these are a bunch of untrustworthy psychopaths who feel betrayed, chuck in a couple of knives and a phew wildlings and you've got a Jon snow Shish kebab."
gameofthrones,3e0705,tinytom0888,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:31 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing. Its not the untrustworthy, thieving, raping scum that kill him, its Bowen Marsh/Alliser Thorne who are loyal to the NW, and don't want it to be exterminated, (and Olly, who feels Jon has betrayed him)."
gameofthrones,3e0705,Cryptorchild92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"Even they believe the wildlings to be their enemies, and just recently saw many of their brothers killed by them. They believe that Jon letting them through the Wall is a betrayal, and worse, one that will likely kill them all, as they probably assume the wildlings will attack them once more, just as they recently did. They think the wildlings are tricking Jon, or that Jon is in cahoots with them.  They simply lack the perspective to know that the wildlings just saw themselves saved from death and worse by Jon, and are not the same as the wildlings that just recently attacked Castle Black. And they just don't see that Jon is doing this for virtuous reasons.  It's tragic, and it shows that those men are shit. That's a recurring theme - the rest of Westeros is also busy fighting internal battles, ignoring 2 major existential threats (White Walkers to kill them all, Dany to invade and replace the Great Houses). Human beings are indeed shit."
gameofthrones,3e0705,therapy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:35 2015 UTC,Those were only 3 of the characters that stabbed him...there were others present there which clearly shows their support..
gameofthrones,3e0705,YoYoSun,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"You certainly have a point. But Jon didn't just ""make peace"" with the enemy, he united with them against the literal APOCALYPSE. If Jon was just trying to play peacemaker and the Watch ganged up on him because of it, alright, it'd be a bit weak, but it would make sense. Here, however, they kill the one man among them who knows best about the doom approaching, has faced it, and has managed to convince their ancient enemy to join their side in the fight against the very end of civilization. And we're to believe that the leaders of the Watch, it's finest, most grizzled fighters and commanders all agreed this was a good idea?"
gameofthrones,3e0705,Wolf6120,5,Tue Jul 21 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"I think a relevant point was mentioned elsewhere in this thread - none of the people that murdered Jon were at Hardhome. Those that accompanied him to that battle are the only people that literally saw the true danger of the White Walkers. The others undoubtedly heard stories, but it just isn't the same.  Also, it isn't a rational response - they feel a very visceral betrayal. It's hard for us to grasp, but they fought all their lives against wildlings, and they just fought against them a few months ago, losing their brothers to them. All their ancestors in the Watch fought the wildlings. Then they saw Jon march an army of wildlings straight through the Wall."
gameofthrones,3e0705,therapy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"It drives me batshit crazy how no one takes the White Walkers seriously. I guess it kind of makes sense in the South, that they think it's just Northern superstition. But at the Wall itself..."
gameofthrones,3e0705,Cataclyst,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:25:28 2015 UTC,"I'm going to just copy what I said somewhere else:  ""Not necessarily. While I do feel that the showrunners should have at least have him attempt to explain the Hardhome event, it doesn't mean it'll save him in the long run. People in this sub-reddit have the perception that Jon telling them about Hardhome would somehow make Alliser and his followers magically more open-minded and accepting of the Wildings. Remember that Jon essentially brought the same exact point about the threat of the White Walkers prior to Hardhome and it was met with vocal rejection and disdain. The NW's watch aren't the most objective thinkers when it comes to the wildings, they just don't trust them. The NW in general are aware of Wights and White Walkers, season 2 finale, the wight that tried to kill Mormont in season 1, the NW in the show are more aware of WW and Wights than the book NW. So it's not really that they don't see WW as threats, it's more along the lines of distrusting the wildings. It's akin to Jews asking Nazis to help fend off a zombie apocalypse, sure some of them may put differences aside but they are have understandble reservations teaming up with such people. The NW and Wildings have a similar history. The small minded NW's members still would have carried out the stabbing.""   most grizzled fighters and commanders all agreed this was a good idea?   Judging from what the guy has said about wildings in the past, this really isn't surprising at all."
gameofthrones,3e0705,YoYoSun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:47 2015 UTC,I didn't read the books. Why did he lead the crows against the Boltons? Was he aware that they had Sansa? Did he beat them?
gameofthrones,3e0705,_Pornosonic_,7,Tue Jul 21 09:00:43 2015 UTC,Sansa doesn't marry Ramsay in the books. The Boltons just use a less important Northern girl and pretend that she's Arya.  The stabbing is instigated when Jon receives a letter from Ramsay saying that Stannis is dead and that Ramsay plans to come and destroy the Night's Watch because he wants Reek and his bride back. Jon breaks his oath and declares that he's going to ride to fight Ramsey with whoever will join him. This is the main reason why the men stab him.
gameofthrones,3e0705,TensePsychopath,-5,Tue Jul 21 10:14:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, dude. Massive spoiler. I only watched show and now I now Sansa and Theon make it to the Night's Watch. I suggest you mark it as a spoiler to avoid ban. I wonder how they go about coming back to the Wall in the show, now that Jon is not feeling that well."
gameofthrones,3e0705,_Pornosonic_,6,Tue Jul 21 10:22:19 2015 UTC,They don't. Ramsay just thinks it because Ramsay. They're in nearly exactly the same position in the books that they ended up in the show. Also with the amount of deviations that are happening I really wouldn't expect the show to follow the books much anymore.
gameofthrones,3e0705,TensePsychopath,2,Tue Jul 21 10:28:47 2015 UTC,"In the books, Theon and fake Arya are currently with Stannis who is alive and well. So they're really going about it in a completely different manner so you don't need to worry about getting spoiled."
gameofthrones,3e0705,Cryptorchild92,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:28 2015 UTC,And ate our families? And made us watch?  Because psychopathy?
gameofthrones,3e0705,KennethSnow,6,Tue Jul 21 02:15:00 2015 UTC,"Except the only person with that mindset is Olly. Also, the Thenns didn't come with Jon, so the family eaters aren't present, and Olly already avenged his parents with Ygritte. I'm sure the Watch killed plenty of Wildling families too during the centuries of war. The only difference is, they're smart enough to know when they need to work with their enemy to stop the end of the World."
gameofthrones,3e0705,Wolf6120,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"The only person with that specific need for revenge is Olly, but anybody observing Jon could agree with Olly over Jon.  Hell, I do, and nobody ate my family (yet).  Could have swore that I saw a Thenn or two with Jon, if not, then my mistake.  Olly didn't avenge his parents with Ygritte, how do you figure that one raider killed is all it takes?  Everybody he ever knew was slaughetered by a wildling strikeforce.  I don't think that the Night's Watch is very convinced that it's the Apocalypse.  How will the walker's get past the wall?  Whatever answer you give, how come that didn't happen in the past winters?  I assume that they simply aren't as worried about that.      I'd rather put my energy into mustering support from the realm, rather than trying to recruit a desperate mortal enemy."
gameofthrones,3e0705,KennethSnow,0,Tue Jul 21 02:53:34 2015 UTC,"Also, the Thenns didn't come with Jon, so the family eaters aren't present   But Tormund - Jon's BFF and now de facto leader of the remaining wildlings - is, and Olly knows he was with the group that ate his parents.  And the BIG POINT of the whole Watch-wildling conflict is that each side sees the other as one homogenous evil entity.  So it doesn't matter to Olly or the other Watch members that the Thenns didn't cross the Wall with Jon.  ""They're all wildlings, come to slit out throats in the night!"" is basically the mindset of almost the entire Watch, and I don't know how many more times that could be repeated.  And the same feeling is true for nearly all the wildlings towards the Watch.  The difference is that some of the wildlings have accepted the need for help and agreed to place some trust in the Watch, and they know firsthand what happened at Hardhome and escaped.  Only a handful of Watch members saw it and lived and they're not the ones making the decisions."
gameofthrones,3e0705,komacki,10,Tue Jul 21 04:34:05 2015 UTC,"The Show For the Watch doesnt make much sense.  Forget all talk of wildlings for 5 seconds.  They saw the Others.  This wasnt just Sam being fat with his crazy stories about ""slaying"" an other with dragonglass. This isnt ancient stories or crazy wildling superstition. They sent almost half of they remaining black brothers to Hardhome to save what wildlings were there. And they got their shit wrecked by the Others.  There should be NO question that letting the wildlings in is not only the smart, but correct decision. They've seen and fought, and lost, to a much much worse enemy. One with superhuman powers and terrifying magic. Every wildling left north of the wall is another potential soldier in the Others' army.  And yet they still kill Jon snow over the wildling debate. Why? Because D&D threw book pacing out the window, putting Hardhome before the watch rebellion, making the entire premise of it super illogical."
gameofthrones,3e0705,Lord_NiteShade,3,Mon Jul 20 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"They saw the Others. [..] They sent almost half of they remaining black brothers to Hardhome to save what wildlings were there.   It looked like far less than half. Just a few went - most of the crews of the ships were Stannis's men, they were his ships.  I think you make a valid point, that if more of the Night's Watch had been at Hardhome, things might have been different. Indeed, none of the people to stab Jon were at Hardhome. None of the murderers actually saw it."
gameofthrones,3e0705,therapy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:24 2015 UTC,In essence he'd have been a lot better off had he brought twenty good men.
gameofthrones,3e0705,Gurusto,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"And as far as we know Jon never actually told them about Hardhome.  It would seem that he actually neglected to tell them considering that he only got around to telling Sam on the day he leaves for Old Town, which would mean that he had not gathered the men for a debrief.  So if that is true then for all that the traitors know...    Jon pissed off on a fools errand Got even more Nights Watch killed (during the Hardhome fight he shouts ""Nights Watch, With me"" and a good half dozen at least go with him and iirc only Edd makes it back with him and Tormud). Ordered them to let 5,000 wildlings through the Wall. Neglected to actually tell them why he done all of the above.   Those who already thought he was a wildling sympathizer would understandably not exactly be pleased with him."
gameofthrones,3e0705,DougyAM,2,Tue Jul 21 04:28:33 2015 UTC,"They didn't send all remaining Watchmen - they sent what looked to be about 40-50% of the force. Also, more importantly, none of the people who stabbed him were at Hardhome - they have been hearing stories about the Walkers for years, why would this one make them change their views?"

I really don't remember and don't feel like finding that spot in the book."
gameofthrones,3e0705,yaitskov,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. In the book he receives the infamous Pink letter, which is supposedly written by Ramsay and outlines Stannis' death and defeat. He gloats that he has Arya and Jon rounds up the Watchmen and wildlings who are willing to march south with him to retake Winterfell.  Because of this he is oathbreaker, and that is a major reason he is then betrayed. This subplot is 100% absent from the show, thus removing a major and logical reason for his betrayal."

gameofthrones,3e0705,yaitskov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:18 2015 UTC,"From his black brother's perspective he is using the watch in that scenario as his own personal army, driven by family and lands. The last time a Lord Commander did that he tried to declare himself King Beyond the Wall and the King of the North had to ride up with an army to stop him.  Its the reason castle black has no exterior walls, so it cant be use like a traditional fortress if the Night's Watch decides to ignore their vows. It's only ""wall"" it The Wall. Because its only purpose is to man The Wall."

gameofthrones,3e0705,yaitskov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:41 2015 UTC,They saw the Others.   A few select people saw the Others.   They sent almost half of they remaining black brothers to Hardhome to save what wildlings were there. And they got their shit wrecked by the Others.   No they didn't...it was a small amount of the overall NW brothers.  Also recognizing the threat of the Others doesn't equate to them trusting the wildlings. It's two different things entirely. You can tell they just don't trust them regardless of what is at stake or not. The context and history is there.
gameofthrones,3e0705,YoYoSun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"They have supernatural powers that are apparently held back by a wall.  A wall that's been there for many winters.  No need to recruit some Thenns.  It's perfectly plausible that some crazy convicts and bastards didn't see it according to your larger view.  Some guys fuck their sister, some people summon demon babies, some people kill people who invite Thenns in for dinner."
gameofthrones,3e0705,KennethSnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:21 2015 UTC,The knowledge of the walls magic is not common knowledge among men of the watch. The few who do were mostly dead by that point.
gameofthrones,3e0705,Lord_NiteShade,3,Tue Jul 21 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that even without knowledge of the walls magic they all experienced the Wildlings failing to climb it and that was a 100,000 strong army.  History is full of over confidence, they perhaps believe that because they could hold off 100,000 wildlings they could do the same to a bunch of mindless zombies. Especially if they think that the lords of the south will send at least some form of help should the White Walkers ever actually attack."
gameofthrones,3e0705,DougyAM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:20:42 2015 UTC,"Mance said that the moment he saw how pathetic the resistance of the Wall was, he stopped assaulting and sent most of his people around to climb over."

Its filled with powerful magic that is more prominent in the book.  Among such includes:  1: Aemons unnaturally long life is attributed to the walls magic.  2: The Nightfort has a gate made of Weirwood that opens for black brothers and can talk.  3: The wall repairs itself despite melting (weeping) in the spring thaw.  4: Melisandre claims to be stronger at the wall. She no longer claims to need to eat or sleep. And blows up a wargs eagle with a fireball.
gameofthrones,3e0705,Lord_NiteShade,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"That's pretty sweet, thanks for the info"
gameofthrones,3e0705,KennethSnow,4,Tue Jul 21 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"Jon's actions with Stannis and the wildlings were hugely problematic for the Watch after Stannis lost.  The Watch is dependent on help from the North to continue functioning, and Jon most likely lost the support of the Boltons (because of his alliance with Stannis) and the other Northern lords (by bringing the wildlings south of the Wall).  The other senior leaders of the Watch don't believe the wildlings are trustworthy, but at least in Stannis there was a king in the realm who knew the dangers the Watch faces from north of the Wall.  With him gone they NEED the help of the North, which they won't get with Jon in charge."
gameofthrones,3e0705,komacki,5,Mon Jul 20 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"I thought about this too, then I was listening to a podcast and the topic came up.

So the ""gift"" in the form of a boy was Littlefinger telling Oleanna about Lancel. He had seen him the scene before and since Littlefinger knew about Lancel's sexual relationship with Cersie (along with potentially other crimes) he was able to assure Oleanna of the Sparrows true plan"
gameofthrones,3e0ekb,ejelder21,7,Tue Jul 21 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"I don't recall any debate. Lancel was already loyal to the Sparrows but he wasn't prepared to confess everything to them on his own.

gameofthrones,3e0ekb,av4rice,9,Tue Jul 21 00:14:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is Lancel. When the High Sparrow arrests Cersei, he makes it sound like Lancel unburdened his soul and expressed his sins before LF talked with Olenna. The LF/Olenna convo happened the same episode Cersei was arrested, the timing just seems odd. I think Lancel is the obvious choice, but it might be Olyver, or maybe Robin."
gameofthrones,3e0ekb,sparrten,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:01 2015 UTC,"He did confess some sins before. But if he had confessed the really big ones, Cersei would have been arrested far earlier.  He only confessed to those sins after Littlefinger got involved (forced him to confess, or go himself to the High Sparrow, perhaps). And quickly after that, Cersei was arrested."
gameofthrones,3e0ekb,therapy,7,Tue Jul 21 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"I think they arrested Cersei when they did was because that's when they could do it without much risk.

I haven't heard anyone talk about it this way, but as someone who's struggled with depression (I've read Lena Headey also has, interestingly, so I wonder if she saw it that way too), that scene was a pretty good depiction of what's going on in the head of a depressed person.

gameofthrones,3dym88,_m0s_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:53 2015 UTC,The cave scene in S3E4 and S3E5 ie Beric vs Hound. It is dark and powerful and ends in a way that inspires hope for good things to happen... very rare. To bad the stories of these characters end up pretty much nowhere.  Also John and Ygrite climbing the wall in S3E6. They should get the director of that episode do so more.

Kit is incredibly nervous and always puts his foot in his mouth.  On one, I remember Kit interrupted just to add that he thought rape happened a lot in the real world and liked that it was shown on the show.  True, but kind of a mood killer.  Meanwhile, John manages to make a good point and get a laugh with everything he says.  Quite the role reversal for how their characters behave on the show.  Not that Jon Snow is particularly funny, but he seems to have better social skills than Samwell."

gameofthrones,3e0ug8,zubaz567,3,Tue Jul 21 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters. Tyrion wasnt in KL while all of that was going on with Ned and Robert. He was in the Eyrie and then with his fathers army. He didnt show up in KL until a while after Ned was executed.  Although, even if Tyrion had been there I'm confident that he would have found is way out of KL, and likely overseas.  And thats not taking into consideration that the Lannisters could have still prevailed taking the city if Robert had found out. They were paying many of the soldiers in KL."

gameofthrones,3e0ug8,Jorah_Explorah,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:07 2015 UTC,Well its common belief that Ned is keeping an even bigger secret from Robert that would have had even bigger implications than lying or not lying about Cersei's indiscretions. Thank god for that.

gameofthrones,3e0ug8,Jorah_Explorah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:21:20 2015 UTC,Exactly. I certainly think Robert would have killed the secret or went to war over it. Ned thought so too. The secret was not only a threat to his throne but also a direct reminder of everything he hated and why he rebelled to begin with.

Ned died still believing that the white walkers and giants were tales people told children based on something that happened thousands of years ago. Jon knows that White Walkers are real but has no reason to believe that sacrificing someone will directly result in their defeating them, or that not sacrificing someone will result in the world dying and being reanimated as undead slaves."

gameofthrones,3dy1cc,Pm_Me_Ur_Pianos,5,Mon Jul 20 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. You and I might think Jon and Ned are fine standards for morality. Look at how it worked out for them...  The point is that in our world ""evil"" is some magic we make up to describe somebody we don't agree, don't understand or pretend not to understand. In their world, evil is a race of frozen beings that sweep down from their permanently frozen lands and slaughter indiscriminately, along with a winter that lasts a hundred years.  We have things easy. Sacrificing a little girl will never produce any tangible benefit in our world. It's an easy decision. Even if somebody tried to compel us to do it with some sick ""trolley problem"" scenario, that is still their action. It isn't some intrinsic mechanism to reality that can be operated.  It isn't as simple as you make it out to be, not even in our world, where things are often much simpler than in the one we are experiencing in the story."
gameofthrones,3dy1cc,emperor000,5,Mon Jul 20 18:15:25 2015 UTC,"You are way over complicating things   In both our world and the world of GoT there is very clearly defined idea of morality and right and wrong.   The only difference in these worlds is that sacrificing children has some actual effect on the world around them. But the fact that it works doesn't make it right it just simply works. People who loved FIFA could have murdered the The president to get him out of office, that would have served the purpose for a greater good, but unsurprisingly they'd still be charged for murder.   Not to mention yknow.. The sacrifice didn't help them.. Because they lost. Compounding on that half his army left after they saw it, clearly showing they detested it.   As far as Jon and Ned, I can't say 100% but they wouldn't do that simply based on their morals. Which don't need to be very high considering we're talking about burning girls alive, but apparently there's more supporters of that than I thought."

gameofthrones,3dunbk,JeffGoldblumsGlasses,22,Sun Jul 19 20:55:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was luck. He was pretty much the only man with ambition who had a pretty solid plan to achieve it and do it quickly before anyone could react.  With Theon taking Winterfell, Robb marrying the Westerling girl and the Karstarks leaving, he realised that the war was starting to take a turn because of the North not being secure and Robb not using his head. Ramsay was in control of the majority of the forces gathered to take back Winterfell and Robb, Catelyn and Sansa were believed to be the only Starks still alive (with Sansa being the Lannister's prisoner).   With two moments of treachery 1. Ramsay's army turning on the other Northmen as the Iron islanders handed over Winterfell 2. Him killing Robb, Catelyn and all other Northmen not loyal to him, he was able to neutralise all remaining members of the house that ruled the North for 1000+ years and the majority of the warriors who would oppose Roose. He now had control of Winterfell (the symbolic capital of the North) making it obvious who were the new rulers and was the only Northern lord with an army to back up that claim. He also had the full support of official king of Westeros (or rather his uncle Tywin) and he doesn't owe his temporary allies (the Lannisters and the Freys) anything because they did just as well, if not better, out of the arrangement.  He then organised for Jeyne Poole to pose as a grown up Ayra (everyone who knew the young Ayra in Winterfell was now dead) and marry Ramsay making it contradictory to fight the Bolton's position as Ayra is the rightful heir of Winterfell.  The only real threat to his power was Stannis which is something he really couldn't have accounted for and even still the odds are in Roose's favour."

gameofthrones,3dunbk,w32015,18,Mon Jul 20 00:15:50 2015 UTC,She's had a revenge arch ever since Syrio died. She begins thinking the faceless men are the best killers and that it's her only ticket to get revenge. She's now learning that she can't just go killing people just because it's for revenge. This is currently like the peak of her arch.
gameofthrones,3dunbk,Starfishsamurai,21,Mon Jul 20 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"She's been on a revenge arch for a long time but I don't agree that this is her peak.  She's accumulated a lot of varied skills that could be employed in a variety of ways and I really doubt having her languish in the Faceless God's temple while blind is her endgame.  It does seem she's learning that being a follower of the Faceless God probably isn't for her and therefore she might abandon it, but she will retain the skills and knowledge she's gained.  But my point is, to what end?"
gameofthrones,3dunbk,w32015,8,Mon Jul 20 00:52:05 2015 UTC,"This is GoT. The only end is we get hyped and have hope she will prevail. Then she dies in a gruesome and unfair way. Maybe her ship back to Westeros will sink and she will drown, the end."
gameofthrones,3dunbk,chialeux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:24:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  I feel though Arya is a case of GRRM creating and honing a long-term and human ""Chekhov's gun.""  I personally would be very surprised if after hundreds of pages and several hours of screentime Arya's arch ends out in the middle of nowhere (relative to the larger plot) with a whimper.  Let me put it another way: The important ""good guys"" who seemed to be very intregral to the unfolding plot before the died were at least in the thick of things when they were killed.  If Arya died in the temple or on a ""ship back to Westeros"" that would be the biggest waste of literary storytelling ever because she really hasn't accomplished anything consequential by using all of her newfound character growth and training."

And then maybe she would rebel..

He said that through flashbacks, we will know the important events that transpired throughout these times so it would be pointless to have a full series for it. However, GRRM stated his interest in doing a series around the Age of Heroes where most of the story has been lost/forgotten/discarded. He want's to explore the beginning of the Others, the Night's King, Azor Ahai, The children of the forest, etc. and I think I agree with his reasonings. We already know a ton about Aegon the conqueror and Robert's Rebellion but I'd love to see the events that transpired during the age of heroes."

So Littlefinger doesn’t have the intelligence on him. He knows they’re scary and creepy and not to be folly trusted and it’s part of a larger plan.”"

gameofthrones,3dzv9m,Failsnail64,2,Tue Jul 21 12:15:38 2015 UTC,"It's show-Littlefinger, not book-Littlefinger.  I'd say on the show - and probably the book as well - Varys has more spies.  The difference between Littlefinger and Varys, though, is that Varys would just have spies EVERYWHERE, no matter what.  Littlefinger would only have them where he thought it was strategic.  Until Ramsay became a player - i.e, he became a Bolton instead of a Snow - he probably wouldn't have bothered.  (Not to mention, Roose is scary in either world, so he may have just avoided the Dreadfort entirely.)"
gameofthrones,3dzv9m,Chasmosaur,4,Tue Jul 21 13:18:06 2015 UTC,"According to Word of God, no, he didn't know a lot about Ramsay.  I don't really buy that but I'm willing to overlook it for several reasons.  First, while he does have a creepy affection for Sansa, he also sees her as a pawn he can use in his quest for more power.  So I don't think it would be out of character for him even if he did know about Ramsay.  That's because, second, he knows that Roose is not a psychopath.  Keeping Sansa (mostly) safe is very much in Roose's best interest because it is the perfect way to keep the other Northern lords in line.  And he never planned on leaving Sansa in their hands permanently anyways."
gameofthrones,3dzv9m,komacki,5,Mon Jul 20 22:02:29 2015 UTC,Keeping in mind Ramsay is a very smart psychopath. Only those who have seen him shirtless in action know what he's really capable of

When Littlefinger said that she would be safe at Winterfell, he more meant that it's unlikely that she will be killed, since the Boltons need to legitimize their seat at Winterfell with a marriage to a Stark. It's true that Littlefinger loved Sansa's mother, but I don't think that affection fully transferred to Sansa. He cares about Sansa but he is willing to use her and put her in dangerous situations to further himself in his ambition for power."

gameofthrones,3dz4gi,bedintruder,2,Mon Jul 20 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"Many wargs have skinchanged into other humans, there is canon for this. The more complex the creature, the harder it is to take control of them. Hodor is a pretty simple creature, Bran would have a pretty tough time skinchanging into any other person at this point.   The thing is, when wargs take control of something, the creature mentally fights back to regain control of its mind and body. Most wargs slip simply into animals they already have a strong bond with and its not a problem, the animals lets them take over. Wild animals can offer resistance to a warg and mentally fight back. Regular people put up a fierce mental fight, Hodor simply ""hides in a corner"" in his mind. Basically, the amount of physical fight a creature would put up, is kinda in line with how much of a mental fight it would put up against a warg.  Dragons are among the most magical, complex, and fierce creatures in all of Westeros. I'd have to imagine trying to skinchange into one and fight control of it mentally would be just as tough as physically fighting the dragon. There would be a better chance if there was an actual bond of some sort.  Sure he might become one of the most powerful wargs ever and may become the first to accomplish it, but again, there has never before been a warg that took control of a dragon."
gameofthrones,3dz4gi,bedintruder,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:39 2015 UTC,Varamyr Sixskins had 3 bears and a shadow cat.  It would definitely be difficult but I don't think its quite the same as fighting it one on one.
gameofthrones,3dz4gi,stacasaurusrex,2,Tue Jul 21 05:23:11 2015 UTC,"Varamyr has 3 wolves, a single bear, and a snowcat. Yes, he seemed to be one of the more powerful wargs, yet he still wasn't able to skinchange into that one woman. Also it was known that Varamyr stole animals from other wargs, he even talked about how easy it was to take over an animal that had already been used by another warg. So really, he could have stolen the bear and the shadowcat and every other animal he had for that matter. We know for a fact that he stole Greyskin and Orell's eagle, and that he desperately wanted to steal Ghost.  Also, Dragons > Bears"

I did forget about the stealing animals things but I was just trying to make the point that I don't think its necessarily like going fisty cuffs with the animals and that it wouldn't be farfetched for a very, very strong warg (maybe one that's also a greenseer) to take on a dragon."

I think it's a mix of things which resulted in her doing that. She was sort of jealous of Cat too, because Petyr loved her.

Not to block and hold against a slash or thrust, but to attack the blade itself and get inside, or to sidestep and allow it to glance, throwing the opponent's weapon out of balance and leaving you an opening.

He kept saying you raped her you murdered her and Elia of Dorne! Say her name! and kept making cuts and gashes through his armor. I was like yes, yes, finish him. But alas, the chapter finished with his face getting smashed and Tyrion throwing up his breakfast (described in great detail).  Tyrion's final thoughts in that chapter were darkly hilarious:  “I put my life in the Red Viper’s hands, and he dropped it. When he remembered, too late, that snakes had no hands, Tyrion began to laugh hysterically.”"

But it also introduces so many new things in a short period of time. Tommen's love of cats, the dragon skulls, Varys and Illyrio being in contact asw well as the idea of Arya leaving the Red Keep. Sets so much up, without you actually realising."

gameofthrones,3dwg0w,hectictw,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie I hate these videos that explain r+l=j and other theories. I just don't like spoiling things for people. Videos like these make these spoilers involuntarily because you don't even need to watch them to be spoiled. You could just nonchalantly glance at the thumbnail and make a connection. I've seen videos on the front page of youtube and the sidebar with a picture of Jon with titles that include words like ""resurrection explained"", ""Who are Jon's real parents?""  I mean- ugh. Book readers have mostly done a good job keeping spoilers a secret from show-watchers and theories to themselves and others who have read the books. Now I'm going to be honest and say that I didn't even watch the video, but based alone off of the thumbnail and title, the dude is treating the tower of joy story as if it is actually written with r+l=j as fact. No. Even though I'm a strong believer in this thoery, I just feel as if it shouldn't be treated in this manor.  I'm sorry for this small rant, har! I'm tired.  edit: just some background as to why I feel this way. Before I finished reading the books, I saw the letters R+L=J. I made the connection that J was Jon. It didn't happen right away, but I thought about it. This nudged me into thinking that Jon wasn't Eddard's bastard but was in fact Lyanna's son. However, I believed that R was for Robert haha. It wasn't until after I was finished reading that I read up on all of the theories."

They will end at the exact same time. The White Walkers and the Dragons destroy each other, and destroy everything else with them. The two top players in the game of thrones, Lttlefinger and Varys, will be the only main characters alive at the end of the ASOIAF series. They will stop playing the game at the end because there will be no more pieces to play with. They will part ways and rule over whatever was left, leaving each other alone, because neither are the winners of the game of thrones.   Edit: It's either that or everybody drops all of the politics and fights the White Walkers, overcome them, and create a democracy in Westeros.

gameofthrones,3dw14o,Mfrendin_Roar,6,Mon Jul 20 16:12:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if they do this. If this doesn't happen then the movie rumors might gain steam.

HBO said they want it to go longer, obviously for money reasons. D&D are the biggest fans in the world and they know how the books will end so I trust them. If they say seven seasons is enough, it's enough. If they change their minds and say seventeen seasons are needed, I'd still trust them."
gameofthrones,3dw14o,FreeDennisReynolds,5,Mon Jul 20 07:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They planned it for 7 seasons from the beginning and Season 5 was the kick to the teeth book 5 of the series with all the main characters in worse situations. They're working it like a literary 7 parter.    Season 6 will be where things get get worse but in a fun way like more crazy action scenes like Hardhome and is going to end bitter sweet like Season 2. Like Dany musters her force to face the army of the dead and Littlefinger, as the new warden of the North, uses a shitload of Wildfire to topple the wall and allow a stream of White Walkers to march into the North.   Then Season 7 will be the war between man and death and whatever ending George has in store. No doubt it'll go to the edge of ruin and back at the last second before all is lost."

More politics in Westeros, but consolidating on Littlefinger winning while the other houses weaken each other, as we have been seeing. Then perhaps Dany vs. Littlefinger or whowever else is left. A massive White Walkers / everyone else war. A few episodes for a few big battles. Bran plays a crucial part against the White Walkers. Arya kills some crucial people. Insights/revelations as to the White Walker's origins, source of R'hllor's power, parentage of Jon Snow, stuff like that. Miscellaneous tidying up of minor storylines (Thoros&Beric, for example) - some might end up without resolution, I suppose.   2 seasons, or 20 episodes, seems sufficient, if no new plotlines are introduced."

gameofthrones,3dw14o,MarvelShazam,12,Mon Jul 20 02:31:00 2015 UTC,No they'll go past the books and end the show before the books end. The show creators know how the books will end.

It makes sense that it would be so he can finish the books and so the show could catch up to them and end at roughly the same time.  He's already said that he's going to try to release Winds of Winter before season 6 and it is very likely that A Dream of Spring is mostly complete and could be released before season 7 or 8 if there is one."
gameofthrones,3dw14o,emperor000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:23 2015 UTC,"Getting Winds out before Season 6 is his best case scenario.

I don't know why he takes a long time to finish books, that's his business. But he does. And there is definitely no reason to think that he's simultaneously working on Dream and that he'll have it done before the last season. He's said nothing of the sort, you pulled that one out of your dreams."

gameofthrones,3dw14o,DeathFeind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"Not unless they add more episodes per season. 8 could be enough though and wouldn't make it feel too rushed I hope. They're revisiting some dropped storylines from the older books, they've probably read TWOW draft or at least what GRRM has written which is a lot I'd imagine and is meant to be the biggest book in the series so they've got tonnes of material to do still and then they've got to finish the series off. Hopefully we get more than 20 hours of GOT."
gameofthrones,3dw14o,Coolica1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:31 2015 UTC,"I think that the next season is going to be mostly about the Westerosi politics, and I think Dani is going to start paying a big role in it. Right at the end of season 6 the White Walker situation is going to start posing a direct threat to the people of Westeros (I'm hoping we get to see the wall come down) and season 7 will focus mostly on them dealing with that and throughout the war the true ruler of Westeros will rise above. And I have a good feeling some dragons might help whoever that person is (wink wink)"
gameofthrones,3dw14o,TeaTimeWithKarl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:43 2015 UTC,I think 9 seasons would be good if our homie at the wall stays dead. We'd need another season for another character to reach the same place Johnny was as the main adversary of the White Walkers.   They'd be able to manage it with 8 seasons hopefully but I'd like 9 to fully flesh out the winter and the aftermath.

gameofthrones,3dwi2m,Bronco30,3,Mon Jul 20 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"There's some truth in that actually. Samwise was actually like the opposite of Samwell in a lot of ways. Samwise was headstrong and tough and obviously ""brave."" But I think as time goes on we see Samwell becoming more like that."
gameofthrones,3dwi2m,Tom908,3,Mon Jul 20 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"The way i see it Samwise's unwillingness at the start of LOTR makes him seem like an average character, but in actual fact he is every part the quintessential hero, always willing, always ready, and ready to face any obstacle because he knows he's right. Several times when Frodo is failing it's only Samwise that (sometimes literally) picks him up and carries on. Of course Frodo has the burden of the ring, but Samwise carries the ring for a time and is able to resist the temptation to turn back, despite his best friend being killed (he thinks). I'll note this makes him one of the few characters in the LOTR universe to be able to resist the power of the ring.   Anyway, i think Samwell is like a realistic version of Samwise, he doesn't just seem like an average person, he is, He doesn't just seem like a coward who is revealed to be a hero at the first opportunity, he is a coward down to his bones. The thing about Samwell is he knows this (unlike Samwise who just sees himself as a normal hobbit) and tries to do what is right despite it.   I'll say we've all been waiting for Samwell to turn into Samwise but GRRM rebuffs us at every book. Perhaps he is trying to teach us some people don't change, so i wouldn't be surprised is Samwell doesn't change next season. I think we can count on him still doing what he thinks best though.   TL;DR:  Samwise is a quintessential hero hidden under a thin veneer of normalcy.   Samwell is a coward, knows he is a coward, but makes it by as a normal person trying to navigate his way                through tough times."

It would've made total sense if the faith militant were already so powerful that they could just incarcerate them without proof and the hearing was just a mock trial, but for that the show would've had to build it up how they got so powerful. In the end it just seemed like that everybody was ok with counting this as evidence for the Quenn and her brother lying."

gameofthrones,3dttm5,idontlikeflamingos,153,Mon Jul 20 03:00:26 2015 UTC,"The pacing was pretty shit overall. It felt like they spent way too much time on some plot points (Arya in Bravos, Dorne), and rushed others (Stannis, most of KL, how For The Watch played out vs. the books). Cersei and Dany's plotlines were the only ones that were consistently well paced from start to finish. The season felt creaky and/or forced far too often."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,ProbablyHighOnMonday,47,Sun Jul 19 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"That's my biggest issue with it too. It wasn't the ""plot holes"" (who are mostly just things people didn't like so they say it didn't make sense), it was the pacing. It felt... off. The first half of the season was boring and the final episode felt like a fever dream at times. It started dragging, got it right during episodes 7 to 9 but finished rushing.  I still think Dorne, despite how poorly developed that storyline was, has an end game and will become very important for the next few seasons. That's why we had Oberyn and the show had the continent on the spotlight during this season, otherwise that was a absolutely huge waste of screen time."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,idontlikeflamingos,14,Sun Jul 19 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the ""plot holes"" (who are mostly just things people didn't like so they say it didn't make sense)   Is Jaime telling Myrcella he's her dad-uncle due to him having a change of heart and Myrcella being okay with it and somehow knowing it a valid plot hole? The emotional development was so rushed that the bonding scene was just awful. They could have had a nice father-daughter bonding moment any other way without the daughter knowing she's an abomination of incest. Also, the boat they were on was five fucking minutes from the shore. They could have easily turned around and fucked up the Sand Snakes. Speaking of whom, did Doran Martell not just fucking threaten to kill them if they pulled stupid shit like this? What are they going to do, hide for the rest of their lives or flee the home they loved when the Crown declares war on Dorne?"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,screenpoet,18,Sun Jul 19 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, is it a secret? Should it be a surprise? Everyone on the Seven Kingdoms has heard the rumours since Season 1 and you'd have to be really blind or stupid to not see it as true if you know Jaime, Cersei and Robert. Even Joffrey knew it. Myrcella is in a land that hates Lannisters, of course she'd realize that. But I agree the scene was rushed, as was most of the final episode.   Also, the boat they were on was five fucking minutes from the shore. They could have easily turned around and fucked up the Sand Snakes.    We don't know that they won't do that. Plus I don't think it would be wise of Jaime to tell a Dornish boat filled with Dornishmen to go back to Dorne so he can kill a few Dornish. Especially since he only has Bronn to watch his back.   did Doran Martell not just fucking threaten to kill them if they pulled stupid shit like this?   They did. But when did you get the impression Elaria was smart? She was impulsive even when Oberyn was alive. Her whole plan is blind rage from the get go. She's not being rational.  Again, I'm not saying I like it, but it's not a plot hole. A plot hole would be Bronn killing Jaime and Myrcella because he's also Oberyn's kid. What happened is consistent with how the characters have been acting. Not everyone is smart in this show you know."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,GnarlyNerd,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"The Trystane-is-Quentyn theory that was posted a while back fits so well that I'm basically considering it canon till Season 6 proves it wrong (or right).  Simply put, Doran is behind Myrcella's assassination. Once she's dead, the boat will take Prince Quentyn and his prisoners (one of whom is the Kingslayer) to Meereen, where they'll find not a dragonqueen for the Dornishman to marry, but her Lannister regent and brother of said Kingslayer."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Lord_NiteShade,10,Tue Jul 21 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"That's my big issue as well. Most scenes look like they were shot in one take so they could spend more time perfecting the artsy stuff. Mother's Mercy is the by far the worst offender. The scene with Jon and Sam, as well as For the Watch, featured the absolute worst acting from either character. It felt so forced, like Nutter wasn't even asking them to try. Same goes for Tyrion and the gang, the bad poosy posse, and Dany chatting with her defiant dragon-son. And each of these scenes seemed like they were a couple minutes shorter than they needed to be, like so much of the story was being left untold.   Meanwhile, Cersei's walk of shame was 3 times as long as any other scene, even though at least 5 minutes could have been cut from the middle without losing its effect, and it came out like a freakin' masterpiece. It was almost a shame to have it share an episode with so many half-assed scenes. It seemed obvious to me that that was the only scene Nutter really put his heart into. It's probably the scene he was thinking about while he filmed all the others.   There were some well paced episodes, though, with consistant quality from start to finish, and those ended up being my favorites, especially The Gift and Hardhome. I'm just a major stickler when it comes to pacing. If something seems rushed at all, it's going to ruin the whole thing for me, which is why I could not enjoy the majority of season 5."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,antsugi,80,Sun Jul 19 21:28:21 2015 UTC,"Removing the North Remembers arc  In the books Bolton rule is razor thin. The Stark - Bolton marriage is crucial to maintaining their hold. As is the many lords still kept hostage at the Twins.  In the show, there is no opposition to their rule. Ramsay even brags how he's going around flaying lords who don't pay their tax. No one cares they broke guest right and killed their King. They don't care they had the daughter of their previous lords captive. They don't care they are allies with the freys.  This also leads to them needing to make changes to Stannis to create shock value. In the book he only gets aid from the Iron Bank after he reaches the wall. In the show he has 10000 swordsmen and is backed by an organization with virtually limitless resources. So dnd needed to come up with the terrible cliche of 20 good men to knock Stannis back down.  The Book siege of Winterfell is going to be a pitched battle where the readers see how the north remembers plays out. Which houses are in on the ruse, which will betray Stannis. How will his military tactics work to his advantage.  Removing the north remembered made season 5 north feel pointless and hallow.

Stannis is an outcome, an outsider which may help them get rid of the Boltons and the Freys. If Stannis wasn't in the North with a decent (but weaker every day) army, many lords in the North wouldn't have as much courage or at least, hope, in their scheming against the Boltons.

gameofthrones,3dttm5,awesomejim123,5,Sun Jul 19 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, that was epic. I think GoT script-writing has slipped since the hype has gotten so great.   That was perfectly timed and well acted; Robert shows his ability to relate man-to-man with other warriors and his abrasive attitude to the Lannisters, Jaime is quick witted but shows the morality that ultimately slips through when he loses his hand, Selmy is respectable and admired by all sides for showing respect in return - building us up to hate Joffrey more when he dishonors Selmy.  They portrayed the characters through dialogue rather than the stupidity we saw in S5 with Ramsey and Stannis having to do outlandish actions to portray that 'they are bad' or 'they have changed'."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,TheseAreNotTheDroids,3,Mon Jul 20 04:55:23 2015 UTC,"The Wall sections of the seasons were definitely the best, though I did enjoy Sansa and Cersei's storylines."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,candypuppet,54,Sun Jul 19 15:07:45 2015 UTC,"The lazy writing. Oh, Tyrion just happens to be in the same random brothel as Jorah? Oh, Varys just happens to show up in Meereen right as Dany leaves? Oh, the candle just happens to light up the second after Brienne leaves? Oh, Stannis goes from powerful and unbeatable to crippled in one episode? Oh, the sand snakes just happen to show up in the courtyard the exact moment Jaime and Bronn get there? Oh, the most feared military force in Essos gets absolutely destroyed by old, pasty rich men?"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,EvilCatGod,14,Sun Jul 19 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Tyrion bumping into Jorah in a brothel happens that way in the books too.  Other than that, none of your other points were in the source material and very clearly lazy writing"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,ElliotWalker5,8,Sun Jul 19 21:43:13 2015 UTC,"The moment I actually laughed out loud was when Bronn and Jaime randomly find Myrcella in the garden as soon as they arrive. I thought the kids were hiding from their caretakers, so they could make out, and Jaime just accidentally stumbles upon them? What a coincidence!"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,jrose6717,10,Sun Jul 19 20:32:02 2015 UTC,"Varys turning up was overlooked by lots of fans who were just thinking ""Yay, Varys!"". It's such horrible writing. The reason he can worm his way around King's Landing is because he has been there forever and is very sneaky. He cannot do the same in a city half a world away. It didn't make sense."

gameofthrones,3dttm5,lumpy999,24,Mon Jul 20 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"I loved stannis so much and they just shat several reasons in 2 episodes just to kill him off.   Dorne went nowhere. Where the f*** is the riverlands? Has everybody just forgot about the war and robb starks revenge arc?   Why the hell is ramsey a ""super warrior"" with an invisible exosuit? How the fuck could he had just taken ""20 Good men"", sneak into the Camp filled with soldiers and the best commander living in westeros who forgets to put up even basic sentries, lights several fires (despite the freezing ass cold) all simultainously and nobody fucking notices. If you've ever tried to light a fire in freezing ass cold and even using gazoline, iz fookin impossible.  Kingslanding. Meh, meh, meh, high sparrow is portaied as evil and the religion is portrayed as evil. Ok  Jamie, 0 character developing, still very stupid. When he loses his hand in the book he gets way smarter and changed personality. He does not become entierly good but still decent. In the show ""he likes to improvise"", stealing the daughter who is promised to a prince? Great Idea instead of just talking to them. Cus Hey, when they find that the princess gets abducted and suddenly appears in KL? That's totally not gonna start a war. They could even enter the gardens soooooooooooo easily. Any bandit could just casually walk in there, kill trystane and then rape myrcella.  Brienne. Huh, okay okay I get todays society that equality between genders must be 100 % and all that important stuff (I support it and thinks it is good when they add homosexuality, strong female characters and such. But 3 things is wrong with brienne. 1:she has no clue what the heck she is doing. Calling renly the rightful just because he was nice to her? It is obvious as fkn hell that renly was an usurper.  2: she wanted to find three people in the world. Sansa, arya and stannis and she found them all. In the end of S4 to the end of s5. I don't give a fuck about here revenge and duty arc. It's not fun, interresting or well written. I care more about people like walder frey who butchered and entire army, several noble families and our beloved usurper king under his roof. But hey, that's as bad as mundering your usurper brother who betrayed you and the gods. Where is the high sparrow now and here where you fucking need him?  3: she kills your favorite characters. Stannis, the hound.  Jon snow knows bran and rickon are alive. Samwell told him that in s4. A major fuckup by D&D. That makes sansa rather useless. Or more to say completely useless. Jon could just pass this information to stannis who later on sends ravens to all the northen houses and says: Hey bran and rickon are alive bla BLA bla come join me and put the boltons head on a spike and then we place rickon on the throne of winterfell? But how has D&D tackled this brutal plot hole? They fucking ignored it.  Stannis says that he has no food and cannot march back and therefor make him the King who ran? They seem to push theses factors just to have reasons on why to kill him of. Would the real stannis care more about his reputation rather than his duty? He is not ok with marching back but burning his daughter is okay for him? CuZ that would so much better for the reputation rather than running back. And why does he not fish food or stop by the northen houses on the way there? He could rest his troops, get more troops and food. No instead they portrayed him as some lost cruell dumbass who has no strategic thought in his mind. also if he would want kings blood.. Hmm let's see.  1:maester aemon 2: Mance rayder (he was a true king and not an usurper>he did not usurp in the seven kingdoms instead forming a kingdom in a wasteland). 3: Mance rayders baby  Also we know that the lord of light is the actual one true god or he is atleast the most likely candidate for the true religion. Then come the sacrifice not work? Wtf is this BS, they're even introducing more characters from that religion so it must be that they are aiming for in the show? More red god? The battle between the great other and r'hllor? Huh? Even though he may not be azor ahai the sacrifices must atleast work?   Arya: no character development just random aswiping on dead dudes and then all of a sudden a wild merryn trant appears. Whoaa such very important revenge arc!!! Omg he killed syrio 4 seasons ago (and the funny part is that he is most likely alive and well)  But to make us all remember that he is a bad guy, 1 episode before his death they have to make him a super sadistic pedophile who killed syrio and beat sansa. Feels rushed just to make him suddenly appear as a bad guy just to give us an amazing arya moment which infact was just way to much brutal and sadistic. Arya is also a sadist wtf. The only character development of her is that she became sadistic out of no fucking reason.   Mereen. Danaerys. When a wild army of sons of the harpy appear and kills Selmy and some castrated unsullied who just happens to lay with a Female harpy. Anyway, Selmy the most honroble man in westeros, won most singel combats in history and fought in several wars gets betrayed by the crown and decides to follow his true king/Queen- the targaryens. He later gives good advice to dany and then decides to walk around alone on streets without armor EVEN THOUGH THE SONS ARE REPORTED TO ATTACK PATROLLS AND WHOOPPS, he dies. What an interresting ending to one of the best characters in the show. He was just killed clearly for shock value or to show that the harpies are strong. He could really have used that plot armour that ramsey had.  Anyway I feel that the show is just very predictable now. It's just a normal show turned around where only the good ones die and some few bad ones. Imagine the walking dead if more of ricks group would die instead of the enemies they met.  I mean neds death was good for the plot, robbs (long may he be remembered) was also good, renly (even though the shows version of renly was bad) was also kinda good for the plot, the hound was kinda good,catelyn was good and Jon snow was a good idea that turned really bad from the writing. But it just gets way to much when they kill good people for now reason or just for shock value. Is this shock value BS something to make the death of exo ramsey more satisfying? They did not and should not have killed stannis, barristan and shireen.  The Show is just skipping good parts of the books such as greyjoys, arianne, quentyn, coldhands, Manderlys and several others and instead giving us 30 minutes of grey worm and mellisandre try boning but grey worm maybe or maybe no have cock. Hmm does he have a cock or does he not have a cock? This is some good material for the next 2 seasons to focus on.  Grey worm, just pull your fucking pants of and let us know if you have a cock and then we can be done with this storyline in 30 seconds.  These are my thoughts on s5. Sorry for bad english not my nr1 language and was also writing on phone."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Duzzier,6,Sun Jul 19 20:59:26 2015 UTC,"English was fine my friend, and very colourful ;)  You seem to have a similar view to many people here, and I hope some of these complaints will factor into the show going forward. They will lose fans; they have already."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,lumpy999,69,Sun Jul 19 23:04:27 2015 UTC,"Not a book reader, but up until the last two episodes I felt that this was the weakest series so far. The first four episodes were incredibly slow, pacing wise, with very little actual plot. Aside from a couple of stand out moments towards the end of the series, most of the eventual plot beats in the second half were awful and the only one in the first half ( Selmy's death) was poorly executed"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Stillflying,18,Sun Jul 19 12:45:54 2015 UTC,"If I may ask, what did you think of Selmy as a character? Lots of book readers love him for things that he did after the show decided to kill him off, so I'm curious what someone without that context thinks of Barry the Bold?"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,lumpy999,58,Sun Jul 19 13:05:12 2015 UTC,I personally hated Selmy due to him being a coward and not standing up for Ned when he was handed Roberts letter.
gameofthrones,3dttm5,MoxPistol,12,Sun Jul 19 13:43:21 2015 UTC,"Well, he also stood around when Aerys was going crazy too."

I think Selmy is an awesome character not only because of his fighting skills but also because he was damn honorable and faithful to his kings and duty. Then again.. Jaime killing the mad king was obviously for the best."

gameofthrones,3dttm5,gigantor21,3,Sun Jul 19 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"He ignored Roberts last wish.   Roberts wish was for Ned to be protector of the realm.  But Ned didn't have the courage/wasn't cruel enough to tell the man on his deathbed that his son wasn't his son, and he had no legacy to live on.  So what is Barristan to do when as far as he is concerned, Joffrey is the son of the King, therefore the next King, he has no legitimate evidence to say that Joffrey isn't the King, and another man, best friend to the old King or not, commits apparent treason?"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,ramsesniblick3rd,9,Sun Jul 19 16:44:26 2015 UTC,The note was clear Joffrey was not to be king yet.

gameofthrones,3dttm5,Stillflying,21,Sun Jul 19 14:13:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I hated that scene and him for it. I always heard Ser Barristan was a man of honor who would die for what was right.  Ser Barristan is just like Jaime.

gameofthrones,3dttm5,xWoneo,53,Sun Jul 19 12:04:07 2015 UTC,"The setup for Sansa's storyline made absolutely no sense. The notion that Roose was dumb enough to risk the wrath of the crown by marrying Ramsay to Joffrey's alleged killer was ridiculous--as was the idea that he could rally the North to fight for him against the crown after he killed Robb. He even says that they don't have the men to stop a Northern rebellion early in the season. The whole ""Arya"" plot was already flimsy to begin with, but replacing her with Sansa was just stupid.  It was just one of many areas where D&D just seemed to do shit for the sake of ""upping the ante"", context or logic be damned."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,zrDerhammer,41,Sun Jul 19 12:43:31 2015 UTC,"It seems they feel the need to up the shock value at every turn, with no regard to progress of the character ."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Coolica1,2,Sun Jul 19 12:47:55 2015 UTC,Exactly.
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Atranox,19,Sun Jul 19 12:52:27 2015 UTC,"The notion that Roose was dumb enough to risk the wrath of the crown by marrying Ramsay to Joffrey's alleged killer was ridiculous--as was the idea that he could rally the North to fight for him against the crown after he killed Robb. He even says that they don't have the men to stop a Northern rebellion early in the season.   I mean, That's the point.  The idea is he knows he doesn't have the men to stop a Northern rebellion.  That's why in the books they have the wedding with Farya.    As for whether it pisses off the south, the south have their own problems, and winter is just about there, there's no way in hell they march again North both for reasons of resources, their own problems, and the ability to even survive in the north, and Roose knows that, so he does what he thinks is best to get the North on their side as the winter looms and comes, and it is meant to be a long winter.  His best bet is a flimsy one at that, admittedly, given the North remembers, but what else could they legitimately do?  At worst the north falls apart (which it might have anyway), and at best the North unites under the daughter of their Leige lord they love, and Roose could set his sights on King in the North himself (delusional hope I know).  These kind of marriage alliances are very common for this time/story theme.  Edit: oh, and the goal is a long term one.  Roose believes he can manage any threats for now, and the idea is Sansa has a son.  While the north might act against Roose and Ramsay, dyou honestly think the North would take their revenge on the son of Sansa Stark? The Grandson of Ned Stark?"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,candypuppet,6,Sun Jul 19 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Roose's motives were pretty clear to me. It's Littlefinger's that didn't make too much sense, but I'm sure there's going to be some sort of payoff for it later on especially since we didn't already know too much about Littlefinger's motives already."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,SuttonHoo,5,Sun Jul 19 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"I thought it was very clear what LF's motives were. The new Warden of the North's hold is tenuous, turn the crown on the Boltons, basically get the crown to sanction Littlefinger using their forces/mandate to topple the Boltons. Who could possibly be Warden of the North then? Seems like Cersei may express her gratitude that way. He is already basically acting Warden of the East. If he can boot the Boltons out and set up some sort of puppet government (with Sansa hidden convincing the northmen that he is helping her and will eventually work to free the north from the crown. She is pretty brainwashed by him IMO) he will have the Vale and the North. (Not sure if he would keep Sansa hidden or what though as he can't really marry Sansa without the crown getting pissed, unless his endgame involves just needing the North and the Vale but I can speculate about that all day.). I think maybe he can move to some plan to gain control of the Riverlands soon as well since I see that place as ripe for the taking if he can bump off the Freys somehow.  The Vale is untouched by this war so they are at full strength. The North can't really be taken by anyone from the south. I think the ongoing theme with Littlefinger's development is he keeps climbing to ever higher rungs of the ladder. It would make sense for him to add this other notch in his belt. Keep in mind he did seem to be cool with revealing Joffrey's heritage if the Lannisters were weak enough with Ned in Season 1. I think once he has more power than the crown he can toss off his cloak and go to war with them, perhaps backed by the Iron Bank?"
gameofthrones,3dttm5,candypuppet,57,Sun Jul 19 17:14:21 2015 UTC,"The Dorne plot went absolutely nowhere. No interesting developments between characters, no cool fight scenes, no entertaining climax, nothing. Stannis's character was done no justice, and written off the show so poorly that the Battle of Winterfell, an event that hasn't even happened in the books yet, lasted only two minutes in the finale. Sansa and Theon's stories were merged together for some reason, and almost nothing major happened between them, as most of Winterfell consisted of five minute scenes between the two of them. Ramsay was given an unbelievably thick amount of plot armor, and not one of the Northern houses seemed to have any problem with the way the Boltons were running things. The pacing for the entire season was way off. The first half was far too slow, meaning that they had to cram in all the major plot points and skip over consistent characterization just to keep up with the books."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Pdan4,4,Sun Jul 19 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you on the Dorne plot. I'm on mobile so not going to go super in depth.  I think the final payoff of the scene between Jaime and Myrcylla was worth it. This was the first time Jaime has ever encountered a scenario like this. When she revealed to him that he knew that he was her true father, I immedaitely thought of how fiercely protective of her he will be now... Then she instantly dies in her arms. I felt it was really powerful and climactic.  Also I really liked the character of Doran. I'm not fully caught up on the books yet, so this was a good introduction of him. It was also very refreshing to be introduced to a ""good"" King."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,MakuWasTaken,4,Mon Jul 20 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"The thing is, even if you think the show's Dorne plot was good (and I agree it did have some good aspects), there is just so much unfulfilled potential. I'm only about halfway through AFFC and the events unfolding in Dorne are so much cooler and more compelling than the half-assed Jaime/Bronn rescue mission + shallow ""bad pussy"" Sand Snakes that we got. Hell, they're some of the chapters I've been looking forward to the most. I think you'll agree once you catch up on the reading that the show could have done better in that regard."

Nobody seems to like her aimless wandering in the Riverlands/Crownlands with Nimble Dick.

gameofthrones,3dttm5,Mozzykins,9,Mon Jul 20 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"I believe all of the flaws listed are equally damaging that sum up to a shite season. Personally, the botched failure that is Stannis' storyline makes me the most angry because he was one of the most intriguing characters in the books (imo). But I'm not sure if it's the biggest flaw this season has. It certainly stood out to me though as he was one of my favorites but oh well."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Shvingy,23,Sun Jul 19 14:41:25 2015 UTC,"In my opinion,this has been the HBO's weakest season yet.Although the last three episodes were certainly exciting,with a lot of fights,unexpected deaths,dragons,whitewalkers,fans were forced to endure the seven episodes long drawn out build up first. The show failed to deliver on many of this season’s biggest promises. After all the hype surrounding the Sand Snakes – and four episodes of waiting – the trio turned out not to be the independent, fierce feminine warriors which the show could have used, but instead three more indistinguishable objects of sexual exploitation. In fact, the introduction of Dorne left a lot to be desired. One of the most highly anticipated moments of the season was the long-awaited meeting of Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen. However, after eight episodes of stalling, the pair shared about five minutes of screen time before the Mother of Dragons skipped town on Drogon’s back. Sansa and Theon Greyjoy remained in a stagnant state of fear until the finale – aside from that clumsy, controversial rape scene. Stannis spent eight episodes playing the voyeur to Jon Snow’s growing leadership, before his wisdom with Snow was undercut by his delusional desperation in the final two episodes. Overall, the season had the feel of a show stretching for time, before masking its shortcomings with an electrifying finale."

gameofthrones,3dttm5,Rosebunse,14,Sun Jul 19 17:10:31 2015 UTC,It was just bad acting. Literally felt like some high school drama club whenever I see the sand snakes on screen.  Oberyn was portrayed much better. He was charismatic but also gave off a dangerous air from the very get-go scene with Tyrion. The bland snakes were neither and felt almost forced in to ride off of Oberyn's popularity.
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Rosebunse,7,Sun Jul 19 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"In s4 Oberyn and Ellaria had sex with lots of people, cause they liked sex. They were the active, aggressive part in their relations with the prostitutes and the prostitutes were reduced to sex objects. Tyene's sexuality instead is reduced to being that sexy thing, that flashes her boobs and says bad lines. The scenes with Bronn are less about what she wants, but instead about what Bronn wants. He wants the ""bad poosey"" and she is just pussy then.   Also, sexuality wasn't Oberyn's only characteristic. He was a complicated character, but the sand snakes were reduced to ""sex and revenge"". They were basically indistinguishable and their secondary characteristics like Tyene seeming innocent and Obara fierce were rather shallow and superficial.   As you can tell, I really disliked that storyline... I found it so damn pointless."

There has been small deviations from season-to-season, and I generally didn't care since it condensed a few flavour elements of the books that were frankly not crucial to the story. Stoneheart's obstinate exclusion from the TV series really showed that it started to hurt multiple main characters of the series however, and that's a failing on the writers. The brotherhood without banners should've never been introduced if the intention was to cut her from the show."

gameofthrones,3dttm5,Pdan4,6,Sun Jul 19 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like everything (Stannis' character assassination, Sansa repeating her 'arc' from the earlier seasons in a nonsense context, the idiocy of Dorne, etc etc) stems from an unspoken rule: shock value. What D&D don't seem to get is that the 'shocking' moments in the books are built up in subtle ways. You can read back and realize that everything was set up and the most brutal moments stem from character motivations and the natural development of the plot. They seem to have misunderstood that. They think their earlier success comes from things like the Ned's death, the Red Wedding, but it doesn't. It comes from well-structured plotting and a narrative that adheres to it's own internal logic. Ned didn't die because it's shocking to kill the hero, he died because it made sense. The Red Wedding didn't happen because it's shocking to kill the good guys, it happened because Robb made poor choices."

Seasons 4 and 5 were both all about the transition from the War, which we saw the build up to in Season 1 and then lasted through Seasons 2 and 3. Seasons 4 and 5 have been mostly about fallout from that war. Now that it's done and we have a few more solid plotlines, such as the situation with Sansa and Theon, Cersei, Dany, and Tyrion, I think Seasons 6 will be a bit more focused."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Rosebunse,4,Sun Jul 19 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"I hope so, but Season 6 will be the penultimate season. They would need to fit the amazing things that were cut out of S4/5, and the loose plot of Book 6, which will likely be just a huge as Book 3 (which needed 2 seasons)."

gameofthrones,3dttm5,IDKimnotascientist,3,Sun Jul 19 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"The Dorne storyline was ridiculous. It had a sort of Xena-level quality to it. But I find everything about the Dornish kind of annoying to begin with, though I like Doran (maybe because, being disabled, he's the only person in Dorne who's not a sex-obsessed idiot).  The High Sparrow plot seemed kind of forced and heavy-handed. See my comment here.  Sansa's story I think could have been handled better, though I'm not against having had her go to Winterfel, or even having the rape scene. I think a better way to have done it would be having Sansa when she's given her choice by Littlefinger acknowledge that she's aware that marrying Ramsay would mean having to have sex with him, so that she'd be enduring it by choice for the sake of a longer-term plan.  Stannis's story definitely needed some work. I'm not a Stannis fan and never was, but he's an interesting character, and of course Stephen Dillane is an awesome actor. He should have spent less time at the Wall, and had more build-up to the battle. I think he should have been building up some allies in the North, like he does in the books. His religion could then be a source of tension with them, with sacrificing Shireen being the final straw that leads his Northern allies to abandon him at a critical moment. But all of that might have taken more than one season to do.  * edit - Forgot Brienne. Her whole storyline through every season has been kind of disappointing, outside her buddy comedy with Jaime.  Oh, and Selmy's pointless death."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Courierr_6,3,Sun Jul 19 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"For me, there were too many instances of convenient timing for the sake of the plot. Jaime and Bronn try to nab Myrcella at the exact same time as the sand snakes, the Others attack Hardhome just minutes after the Nights Watch arrives, Drogon happens upon the arena at just the right moment (side complaint; we just assume that the whole crew Daenerys leaves behind escapes just fine, even though there were still many Harpys). What I loved the most about the series was how well they kept the flow of the story line logical. This season fell short to me."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Courierr_6,3,Sun Jul 19 21:22:53 2015 UTC,The biggest flaw with this season was that it could may as well be 5 episodes instead of 10. And some things could be cut off completely and nothing of value would be lost. I actually feel let down which is like the opposite compared to previous seasons.
gameofthrones,3dttm5,de_draak,3,Mon Jul 20 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"Everything felt too drawn out at the beginning of the season and too rushed at the end. The pacing felt bad, in my opinion."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,ApocaLiz,3,Sun Jul 19 16:02:09 2015 UTC,"To me, it was the realism. Yes, this is a fantasy show about dragons, blood magic and warging. But it's also about the reality of feudal life and politics.  So far the story has been somewhat realistic in its characters and their interactions. Ned died because he grossly underestimated how ingrained the behind-closed-doors political game was in Kings Landing, and assumed everyone would be honourable like him and do what they're supposed to do. Robb died because he broke an agreement with an ally, insulting a minor Lord with a lot to prove, laying the foundation for the Frey/Bolton/Lannister plot. Joffrey died because he was a loose cannon with a much more controllable younger brother.  This season felt like it shifted from 'no one gets plot armour' to 'bad guys get plot armour because it makes more shocking tv'. From Barristan getting killed by thugs, to Ramsay Bolton mopping the floor with Stannis at every turn, it just doesn't seem like it had a rhyme or reason. Ramsay in particular felt like a younger, psychotic Aragorn. In the books, he's described as using a sword like a meat cleaver. In the show he's apparently a master of infiltration, sabotage, strategy and tactics. Other comments have also mentioned the lack of 'the North remembers'. In the show the Boltons have so far acted with impunity, while book Roose was doing everything he could to hold things together (and most likely failing).  For whatever reason as well, it was really obvious to me that they made Stannis kill off Shireen to make it more acceptable to audiences when Stannis died. All my show only friends were happy that he's dead, while the book readers either hated it or think he's not actually dead. I'm biased because Stannis is my favourite...but it felt like they just got tired of writing him and decided to cut him out. If he ends up burning Shireen in the books and GRRM is all like 'I was planning on it happening all along, I swear' then I might feel better about it, but I really don't think that's going to happen."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,GrayGreyMoralityFan,3,Sun Jul 19 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"The whole Faith Militant bit felt rushed, from nothing to violently overrunning KL in the space of what? 2 episodes? Just felt wrong. Sand snakes were...disappointing. But the absolute worst scene of the entire season was where Jaime and Bronn turn up at the water gardens. From the second they appear in the Dornish armour I was expecting the Benny Hill theme to start. Maybe a quick cameo from Sid James and Kenneth Williams in Carry On Spearing..."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,emperor000,3,Sun Jul 19 19:30:22 2015 UTC,"No Northern houses besides the Boltons and the Goodmen, no masterful Stannis maneuvering (though the end outcome may be the same), no Frey pies, no Manderlys, and Night's Watch assassination made absolutely no sense in the show.  All of which could have been developed if more time was spent on the North and less on bad poossies, or on Sansa rape.   Daenarys plotline was every bit as boring in the books, so no complaints there.  Condensing the books is not the problem, the books are way too long and tedious. The problem is the mindless content they added in place of perfectly usable book plots."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Aldebaran135,3,Mon Jul 20 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"I think the writing did suffer a little bit, but I think the biggest ""flaw"" (or thing I didn't like) was killing of Barristan Selmy. And it isn't because OMG HE'S THE BEST CHARACTER EVER!!! It just seemed like a mistake, part of the weaker writing and just pointless."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Thrallov,8,Mon Jul 20 05:56:15 2015 UTC,"There is too much hyperbole reading these replies, so I'm going to defend some things as solely a show watcher with knowledge of most of the plot threads that have changed.   1) Dorne: by the old gods and the new, this was a hodge-podge, rushed plot thread with tons of bad one liners and fight scenes, but don't say it didn't move the plot forward or was a waste of time. We were introduced to Doran and see Jaime bring Dorne into the fold, only to have his daughter (presumably) assassinated in front of his eyes. These implications are massive, especially considering the sole reason Jaime is in Dorne is to rescue Myrcella for Cersei, his lover. This was IMO the biggest ON SCREEN flaw of the season. Overall, I would agree the biggest OVERALL flaw of this season was the poor pacing. If this season was supposed to cover most of 1 whole book, they glossed over too much.  2) Sansa/Brienne in Winterfell: I don't know exactly what happens in the books other than Sansa is supposed to be in The Vale (boring) and Brienne is off doing something in the Riverlands with/near Jaimie. I don't know exactly what Brienne is doing in the books, but in the show Brienne Theory This might make too much sense, but it would make some of these plot changes more palatable. Also, while book readers may disagree, the substitution of Sansa for Jeyne probably won't change the major events in the story at all.   3) Jon's Arc: obviously if Jon doesn't come back to life in some way, then that is just stupid for reasons I don't feel I need to list. The wall had one of the most cohesive story lines. Besides an absence of Ghost, the wall was the one of the best parts of this season.   4) Ser Barristan: Book Barristan may be incredible, but show Barristan was not portrayed this way. He was mentioned a few times as being one of the greatest fighters, but he went down to a LARGE group of harpies who are NOT a bunch of nobles in robes as I often see mentioned here, but likely a group of pit fighters. And he did this in a blaze of glory. Ya, some of the fight choreography may have been questionable, but I don't think it was a senseless death to make room for Tyrion. As far as the Unsullied go, they have been kind of lame, constantly dying or being killed. They need some redemption.  5) Stannis: I thought Stannis' storyline was very well done. Sure, it lacks some of the nuance from the books, but what doesn't? Without seeing what happens in season 6/TWOW, I don't think comments on his storyline are even fair at this point. What impact will the death of his family have on Jon? Melisandre? The Realm? What about Davos? Is he even really dead? Everyone is complaining the ""siege of Winterfell"" was so short blah blah blah, but that was clearly intentional to show the short work the Boltons made of Stannis and his men. See Stannis' army get flanked, see Ramsay mercilessly killing his wounded men.  6) Dany and Mereen: Honestly, not much new here. Most people complain Dany's plot barely moves, but this season it definitely took some strides. Adding Tyrion and Varys will make her thread very fun to watch as she moves closer to crossing the Narrow Sea. As far as people claiming such and such was added just for shock value, to me, if there was anything that was shock value, it was Dany and her use of the dragons.   7) LSH/Griffs: If Jon gets a res timer, LSH being cut makes sense. It has been said before, but we can't have red priests/priestesses running around bringing everyone back to life in the show. In the books, where there is far more going on, it's cool, but not in the show. Griff/Young Griff: So much of this show goes over the average watcher's head. Adding Griff/Young Griff would just unnecessarily complicate things and bloat an already bloated plot and cast.  8) Northern revenge: there is definitely a lack of it, but I doubt there won't be a big pay off to come. I hear someone is a good baker. The North Remembers."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,dbutlerjr,2,Mon Jul 20 07:43:40 2015 UTC,"On your points:   1) The storyline is more logical in the books, and Doran has an amazing and awesome plan. I don't mind Myrcella dying, but Jaime grew so much in the Riverlands in the books that I'm sorry show-watchers missed out.  2) Sansa's story is quite dull in the books, but picks up later on. I didn't like the swap of Jeyne>Sansa, but that was more because we lost out on the best parts of Theon's story and the Northern revenge plot.  3) Agreed, though I worry the Watch are being made into bad guys. I don't know where they will go from there.  4) I hated Barry dying and am still pissed, but more because we lose his amazing acts later on and the huge battle that he commands. We can agree to disagree here :) .  5) I hated what they did to Stannis, but again, agree to disagree.  6) I liked adding Tyrion and Varys, but they absolutely lost all nuance of her rule in Slaver's Bay. The troubles she faced were marginalized, and everything was horribly condensed.  7) Disagree on both points; my worry is that they kill many of the better supporting cast characters, but fail to introduce the ones that GRRM creates to replace them.  8) We can only hope, my friend."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,Kalde22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:45:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not a ""Stannis Mannis"" fanboy, but his plot was the most poorly done in the entire show. Since his defeat at Blackwater, everything he's done has been POINTLESS. I mean unless he was a vice to get Melissandre at the Wall, he didn't matter. He saved the Wall, but who cares? It doesn't change much since Jon died anyway, the Wildlings are south of the wall, and the NW is likely to be destroyed. Was that the peak of his purpose? 3 seasons of buildup only for him to die because the Boltons and ""evil"" prevail. He spent 7 episodes trying to convice Jon Snow to come with him, only for him to say no 20 times. Then he starts marching, gets beaten by ""20 good men,"" burns his daughter, and gets wiped out. Didn't even look like Ramsay ""basically God"" ""Bolton even broke a sweat. He had absolutely no point in Season 5 despite all the buildup in 3 seasons.  Also Jon Snow's betrayal was brutally done."

They butchered the Sand Snakes, they butchered the way Doran rallied the SS for his cause with his awesome plans, and they botched the Jaime story as well. * Mannis; this arc was ridiculous. Everything from burning Shireen, Stannis not scouting ahead, half his army leaving with all his horses without anyone noticing, trying to siege a castle without a proper army. Just ridiculous. So sad they butchered the Mannis like this. * Danny: I know lots of people love her, but i don't really. Her story in the books is ok'ish thanks to the people she surrounded herself with (most notably Ser Barristan) and her internal conflict of trying to be a good queen but still being a young girl/woman with her own selfish needs and desires. In the show however, she just does what she pleases, leaning left then swinging right all the time. Not being consistent at all. I think the most telling way is how they portrayed Hizdahr compared to the books. In the show, he was just a victim of Dany. She openly shamed him with her lover, forced him into marriage, killed off her father for a crime he did not commit and showed no remorse killing off another respected prominent just to scare him and others into submission. The way she interacted with Tyrion was also very telling. How often did she have to threaten him to prove a point: ""Why don't i just have you killed?"" ... OK, we get it, you can have him killed if you like, but we all know you won't. Don't have to keep flexing that muscle.    The show was very good when they had George Martin material to work with, but now that is gone, and D&D are on their own, the show lost a LOT of quality."
gameofthrones,3dttm5,pmMeYour_Bewbs,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"I hate the complete rewriting of the sand snakes. I really liked their arc and motivations in the books, and now they're just cartoonish villains."

I think around 2005 San Diego Comic Con, I went to a fantasy author panel. One of the seven or so authors was George R. R. Martin. There were about fifty people in the audience.   I hadn't read his books at the time, but RA Salvatore was also there. All of the questions from the audience went to Salvatore, and all of the authors were treating him as the big name.

gameofthrones,3dwo77,steamboat28,6,Mon Jul 20 03:53:26 2015 UTC,"i.e., saying MFG is the sum total of all the gods in all the religions in all the world   They basically are. Their founder believed that all religions really worshiped death, as an end of suffering in this world. They see all the gods, including R'hllor (on the show, you can see the flaming heart in the HBW), and the Stranger (as the true face of the Seven) as representing death."
gameofthrones,3dwo77,EvilCatGod,3,Mon Jul 20 12:53:14 2015 UTC,"No. Only the death gods. The flaming heart of Rh'llor is there in the show (presumably) because the Red Faith is monotheistic, and therefore, its only God is it's death god. That's why only the Stranger has a place among the statuary, not the Mother or the Warrior or the Father.   In the book (AFFC, ch. 34, ""Cat of the Canals"", I believe) it's much less open to any other interpretation, because the statues listed are explained as those solely of death gods from around Essos and Westeros, and there is talk of ""Him of Many Faces"" being one of the seven (the Stranger).   That, coupled with other contextual clues (in the show, for example, Syrio's ""there is only one god..."" and Jaqen's ""You have stolen three lives..."" bit; in the books the larger description and origin of the Faceless Men) strengthen the case that the MFG is just straight up Death."
gameofthrones,3dwo77,EvilCatGod,4,Mon Jul 20 13:25:18 2015 UTC,"I agree the MFG is Death. I think they just believe that all the gods are Death. They only have statues of the death gods because they believe those are the true forms of the gods - i.e. the Seven are all aspects of one deity, and the Stranger is the true face of that deity. They say again and again they believe there is only one true God. Any not explicitly associated with Death are just aspects of Death. R'hllor is pretty explicitly associated with death even by Melisandre and other followers, he just seems to represent specifically death by fire (""the purest death""). Jaqen also makes that connection - Arya saving him and the two other guys from the fire is stealing three lives from the Red God. It's not a contradiction that death can also be associated with life and rebirth, as it is in real-world religions. After all, ""only death can pay for life."" The Old Gods being associated with Death also makes sense - the spirits in the weirwoods are apparently the spirits of the Children when they die."
gameofthrones,3dwo77,dreamtime92,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:40 2015 UTC,What exactly is your understanding of the MFG?
gameofthrones,3dwo77,dreamtime92,10,Mon Jul 20 07:05:01 2015 UTC,"""There is only one god, and his name is death.""  The faith of the MFG is the worship of death itself. The only idols and statutes in the House of Black and White are representations of death throughout many cultures. The priests are assassins. The mercy they grant is death, paid for by death. It's a death cult."
gameofthrones,3dwo77,dreamtime92,5,Mon Jul 20 07:11:23 2015 UTC,Yep this is the exact interpretation I had. I think the confusion comes from people trying to find twists everywhere in the story.
gameofthrones,3dwo77,Itholon,2,Mon Jul 20 07:30:22 2015 UTC,"I started reading the books after season 1, and finished them all by season 3, I think. I say this because the book is pretty effing explicit about the MFG, and so coming into that plotline in the show, I wasn't looking for clues. Since I'm biased by the explicit handling of it in the book, I literally cannot see why people are confused by it.  So I started this thread to see where people get their opinions from, because I'm genuinely interested."

gameofthrones,3dt3g5,BlushingWallFlower,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:47 2015 UTC,This is one of the best and most hilarious GoT photshops I've seen!
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,downvote_city_bitch,266,Sat Jul 18 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"List's of Stannis' accomplishments prior to the Wot5K.  1: Held Storm's End as a mere boy of 14-15 against the 80,000 troops of the Reach. For an entire year. Resorting to eating every non-human thing until finally saved by Davos.  2: Retook Dragonstone via naval assault against the Targaryen Loyalist fleet while Robert was still bemoaning the loss of Lynna Stark.   3: Destroyed the Greyjoy's Iron Fleet (the strongest fleet on the continent) by trapping them in the Straights of Fair Isle.  4: Becomes Master of Ships in Robert Baratheon's new world order. And rightfully so.   ""This is Stannis Baratheon. The man will fight to the bitter end and then some."" - Tywin Lannister   Tywin of all people sees Stannis as the biggest threat in the Wot5K. Renly thinks war a game, and Robb too blinded by honor."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Lord_NiteShade,54,Sat Jul 18 23:52:07 2015 UTC,Stannis would have thrown several knights who wanted to surrender over the walls but he was advised by his maester that it would be a waste of good meat should it come to that.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,OmNomSandvich,123,Sun Jul 19 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"Renly didn't think war was a game, Renly was fully willing to let everyone else fight themselves bloody and make a slow march to kingslanding and wipe up the remains and take the throne.  Renly was smart about it, its not about pitched battles, its not about heroic charges.  Its keeping the men happy enough to stay, and fit enough to fight.  And ensuring you fight at your best and your enemy at their worst.  He made the smartest play of all, he got blood magic'd because at that point in the story, there wasn't another way to get rid of him.  His men were too loyal, his power was too great, deus ex machina blood magic."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheTurkey5689,71,Sun Jul 19 01:57:37 2015 UTC,He did think war was a game. He laughed as Stannis told him that blood would be shed the next day. He held a tourney during the war.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,wcc7777777,99,Sun Jul 19 02:37:39 2015 UTC,"He laughed because Stannis had 5000 men to his 100,000 +. It was a laughable concept that Stannis, with a army 1/20th his size, and it was light cavalry, boiled leather armor, no heavy stuff, against his.  .  The tourney was to keep the men occupied, again he was slow marching to kings landing he needed entertainment to keep morale up.  The quote: 'Tyrell swords will make me king.  rowan and Tarly and Caron will make me king, with axe and mace and warhammer.  Tarth arrows and Penrose lances, Fossoway, Cuy, Mullendore, Estermont, Selmy, Hightower, Oakheart, Crane, Caswell, Blackbar, Morrigen, Beesbury, Shermer, Dunn, Footly... even House Florent, your own wife's brothers and uncles, they will make me king.  All the chivalry of the South rides with me, and that is the least part of my power.  My foot is coming behind, a hundred thousand swords and spears and pikes.  And you will destroy me?  With what, pray?  That paltry rabble I see htere huddled under the castle walls?  I'll call them five thousand and be generous, codfish lords and onion knighs and sellswords.  Half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts.  You have fewer than four hundred horse my scouts tell me - free riders in boiled leather who will not stand an instant against armored lances.  I do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are, Stannis, that host of yours won't survive the first charge of my vanguard.""  So... yeah, when Stannis says ""Blood would be shed the next day"" he laughed, its completely laughable concept that Stannis would stand a hope of a chance.  edit: found the book quote."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheTurkey5689,7,Sun Jul 19 05:09:33 2015 UTC,"He laughed because Stannis had 5000 men to his 100,000 +.    Mance Rayder wasn't laughing."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TracyMorganFreeman,8,Mon Jul 20 01:54:15 2015 UTC,"That is assuming Stannis would ever launch a front side assault, which he wouldnt have if he didnt had backup plan. You have to realize that Stannis is being indoctrinated by Melissandre from the start, in Stannis eyes he is the hero of the story."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,32,Sun Jul 19 08:02:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would matter, 5000 vs 100,000+ there is no way he wins.  He doesn't hold the city, none of hte lords are declaring for him.... nothing.  Martin blood magic'd him as there wasn't another way."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheTurkey5689,62,Sun Jul 19 09:32:38 2015 UTC,He could split his 5000 men into 250 groups of 20 good men.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Stanlot,35,Sun Jul 19 14:43:19 2015 UTC,"Dear god, he would have been unstoppable."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,ruin,4,Sun Jul 19 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"Even a shirtless Ramsay could not stop him. Stannis and his 250 Ser Twentee Goodmen could even beat the Free Folk and White Walkers both, and still have 248 Ser Goodmen left!"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,ThePratoran,12,Mon Jul 20 02:53:00 2015 UTC,"That point of view also works the same for the reverse. He could have had already the idea that Melissandre had to show her true powers by killing one of the kings in the first place, and then he just gave him a huge unbeatable army, just to contrast that even in the prime position you can get blind sided.  We will never know how it truly came to be, assuming he just wrote himself into a corner and had to bullshit his way out might be downplaying a bit George's writting skills and the time he takes to make sure everything makes sense. He isnt pressed on time to release the books, i love to think that if he feels he is writing himself into a corner he can take the time to scratch some chapters and rethink what is going to happen."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,2,Sun Jul 19 09:43:32 2015 UTC,"The destruction of Renly was the catalyst for a lot of events though, so might've been intentional."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,AllfatherPidgeon,3,Sun Jul 19 14:08:29 2015 UTC,Everyone is the hero of the story in their own eyes.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,idontlikeflamingos,3,Sun Jul 19 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"no , i mean a literal hero. Like when they tell you, you have a destiny and you cant fuck it up"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,0,Sun Jul 19 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"Everything you just said makes me think that he felt war was a game, just that it was a game that he had already won."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,only-comments,2,Sun Jul 19 23:25:10 2015 UTC,"Arguably the tourney was to keep the men entertained while he waited for the others to bleed themselves out. So it isn't so much that Renly inspires loyalty, and more like he had a lot of bread and circuses."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,not_vichyssoise,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:31 2015 UTC,deus ex machina blood magic   idk; there was already a precedent for blood magic and I think the choice of using blood magic against his own brother affects Stannis's character/shows his true colors.  I wouldn't personally say it's deus ex machina
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,idontwantaname123,13,Sun Jul 19 14:30:24 2015 UTC,"He had a massive army, he could have taken kings landing with it any time he wanted. Just give the marching order he wins the war. But no, he pussyfooted around not doing jack shit until stannis showed up and forced him to do something. Making every lord in the realm love you is what you do after the war is won."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,empathica1,27,Sun Jul 19 02:16:54 2015 UTC,"his plan was to wait for everyone else ot fight themselves out.  It wasn't just about overwhelming brute force, it was about the other lords too exhausted to even pretend to fight.  Renly didn't want to just conquer, it wasn't about destroying anything, he visioned himself a good king.  A kind king, and needless death didn't support that.  He would have won save blood magic :( sad."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheTurkey5689,4,Sun Jul 19 05:29:28 2015 UTC,"had blood magic not happened, then stannis cant attack kingslanding then the blackwater bay and all the wildfire would have been used for a sneak attack on Renly, also Tywin troops would have been used against Renly at the same time.  Remember that Renly isnt a warlord, he might be a good ruler if given the throne by birth but he is no warrior and doesnt truly grasp war strategy. Im pretty sure Tyrion and Tywin can out manouver him."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,10,Sun Jul 19 08:05:33 2015 UTC,The host that flanked stannis had a significant number of Tyrell forces. Even if what was left of Tywin attacked Renly it wouldn't be enough.  Also considering that if Tywin did go robb could come further south and possibly threaten casterly rock but if Tywin didn't go kings landing would probably be taken. Given the hopeless lannister situation they have little left and may have surrendered if stannis hadnt taken out Renly and the Tyrell hadn't joined the lanisters.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,the_clord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:42:20 2015 UTC,"i think all of this can be upset by a massive wildfire attack, you have to remember that for the next fight on kingslanding Tyrion is dead set on doing something great and surprising with the stash of wildfire he got.  There is a lot that can be done with a huge stash of wildfire, on land more specifically. Like spreading combustible material near the siege areas near kingslanding and when Tyrell forces march in deploy the wildfire via cathapults setting the whole area and part of Renly's army ablaze.  And that is just a quick idea, im sure Tyrion could come up with a better idea than what i had in 2 mins of thinking about it lightly"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,4,Sun Jul 19 09:52:31 2015 UTC,"That implies Renly needed to attack King's Landing to begin with, the city was already ready to implode(they attacked Joffrey in broad daylight). It wouldn't have taken much longer for the city to fall."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Cabbage_Vendor,4,Sun Jul 19 13:08:28 2015 UTC,"yeah the internal disputes were a problem, if Renly went for a long drawn out siege, trying to make the castle starve and the people revolt. Then he probably would have taken the city easier."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,2,Sun Jul 19 13:13:19 2015 UTC,The people would've taken the city for him.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,AllfatherPidgeon,2,Sun Jul 19 14:10:51 2015 UTC,"If you mean cover the ground near kings landing in wildfire that's a terrible idea because sunlight alone can set it off. As for catapults, I think there are only 3 there and having a bunch of wildfire there is a double-edged sword cause if just some of it catches on fire (like from a fire arrow or something) it will blow"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,the_clord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:58:47 2015 UTC,"im talking about drenching the areas more likely to be sieged at in combustible material, it can be anything that catches fire quickly, you can then easily set the wildfire off. As far as the danger, there is obviously a danger when dealing with wildfire but it catching on fire due to a arrow on the exact same spot we are loading the wildfire is a bit far fetched. You also dont need one huge barrel of it, you can spread it out, once one small bit falls into the drenched field it will set off on fire.  Once part of Renly's army is set ablaze im sure many will defect or his ranks will be hesitant to go foward due to there being other traps like such"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:45:27 2015 UTC,"It's not unlikely that the wildfire could be set of with a flaming arrow from the enemy. When Renly (or any of his generals) see that the 3 catapults are throwing wildfire they will command their archers (and there will probably be hundreds if not thousands of them) to fire arrows there, I think a few of this will set off the highly flammable wildfire. Also I don't quite understand your first point. If you mean cover the area most likely to be sieged (probably the ground in front of the walls) with wildfire the sun would set it off. If you mean pour burning oil then have people on the wall drop jars of wildfire, it won't have the same surprise explosive effect as the black water did. Renly might lose a few hundred troops tops but then he would back off from that area.  The main thing is wildfire is a powerful weapon, but I don't think it alone could defeat renly's vastly superior numbers."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,the_clord,-4,Sun Jul 19 10:57:03 2015 UTC,"Renly didn't have a navy, the wildfire would have been useless in the bay as he had no ships, it was a ground assault not a naval invasion like Stannis had >.>"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheTurkey5689,3,Sun Jul 19 09:31:46 2015 UTC,"Wildfire still works on land, its basically nitroglycerin on steroids. Dropping the men to the water helps a lot in a naval battle but it still can be used in land very effectively"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,0,Sun Jul 19 09:39:31 2015 UTC,"Its a lot harder to build something that would get into the middle of his army and blow up like a ship(s) full of wildfire.  They'd have to launch it via catapult, which is countered by say.... their catapults.  It would still be effective but the true destructive effect the wildfire had was due to it being out on the water in the middle of their ships before they knew what was going on."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheTurkey5689,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:42:43 2015 UTC,"well i think in land wildfire has some advantages, as it can spread much faster. It would be wise to give Tyrion some credit, if he knew about the Renly assault, which by the size of his army its impossible not to know, and if Renly was slow marching to Kingslanding. Then Tyrion would have had time to prepare something like dripping the siege area near kingslanding with combustible material then use the Wildfire to set off the huge explosion, engulfing the whole area in flames. And that is just a quick idea i had, Tyrion could have come up with more witty stuff."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:47:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, what about Twenty Goodmen? He could've killed Renly."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,AllfatherPidgeon,11,Sun Jul 19 14:05:24 2015 UTC,TWENTY.  GOOD.  MEN.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Magic_Narwhal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:40:56 2015 UTC,"I knew that some of the characters in the books were younger, but Stannis being 15 back then seems crazy. How old would that make him in the books now?"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,iKnowJajko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"Roberts Rebellion happened in 282-283 AC. Robert was roughly 16-18, as was Eddard, Stannis was 14-15, and Renly was 8-10. It's hard to give exact ages because characters often don't talk in years.  The books start in the year 299, and its 301 in TWOW preview chapters. Stannis would be in mid to late 30s, with most ""adult"" characters being in their late thirties as well. Tywin is only 55~ in the books when he dies."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Lord_NiteShade,65,Sun Jul 19 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"In ACOK, Stannis' army not only fought on but stormed across a makeshift bridge of burning and sinking ships across a hellish river with burning skids of wildfire for him."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,OmNomSandvich,26,Sat Jul 18 23:33:59 2015 UTC,And... and... he did it with them. You didn't see Tywin storming across a burning bridge engulfed in wildfire.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,wcc7777777,48,Sat Jul 18 23:51:49 2015 UTC,No  Stannis isn't with the frontline infantry in the books; and the bridge of ships isn't there in the show
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,KR4549,15,Sun Jul 19 00:42:26 2015 UTC,Shhhhhhh
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,wcc7777777,3,Sun Jul 19 02:02:13 2015 UTC,facts are scary right
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,KR4549,10,Sun Jul 19 02:33:04 2015 UTC,for the night is dark and full of facts
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,gumpythegreat,4,Sun Jul 19 05:30:21 2015 UTC,Kinda.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,wcc7777777,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:00 2015 UTC,Sorta.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,jymhtysy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:54:08 2015 UTC,Nah its all lies.  Tinfoil theory all the way.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Inferno221,2,Sun Jul 19 03:33:22 2015 UTC,But... Mannis!
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,AyeCurumba,35,Sun Jul 19 11:50:18 2015 UTC,"Renly understood loyalty as love and kind smiles. Stannis understands loyalty as dutiful responsibility. He was the King and stormed King's Landing beside his men, because it was his responsibility and he would see it fulfilled. Of course men would follow him.  Interestingly enough, Robb was like a mix of both. He was loved by the people, he did his duty, and he led by example, riding into battle with his men and bleeding beside them."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Praeventore,17,Sun Jul 19 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"Robb should have been a little bit more careful about the people he surrounded himself with, though. I'm not saying he should have followed through with all of Roose's demands, but he should have been a bit more compromising."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Rosebunse,10,Sun Jul 19 02:24:10 2015 UTC,He had good people around him he just didn't listen to them.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Riekopo,13,Sun Jul 19 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"the fact of the matter is everyone of his mistakes seemed to topple onto each other, keeping his mother who lets out jaime lannister, never listening to his mother about his oath to Walder Frey, stopping the vengeance the karstarks wanted (as stupid as there decisions were Robb at that point needed to respect them) executing the karstark, needing more troops for it and having to turn back to Walder Frey. Trusting Walder Frey after he broke his oath to him, like the Frey's were known for loyalty or anything other then just being slimy pieces of shit. perhaps breaking the chain at anyone of those points would have saved him but when you lay it out Robb didn't just need to compromise the guy needed to pick something and stick with it. He was a hypocrite."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,robieman,16,Sun Jul 19 04:04:20 2015 UTC,"He also embodies the problem with letting someone run a complex military and diplomatic operation just because it's their ""birthright"" or some such crap. Robb shouldn't have been in complete control in the first place."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Rosebunse,13,Sun Jul 19 05:51:02 2015 UTC,"Robb never lost a battle, and he listened to his advisers, Brynden Tully in particular, and he was winning the war right up until The Battle of Blackwater Bay. Not bad for a a leader up against better funded enemies with a larger and better fed armies and oathbreakers and treasoners in his ranks."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Praeventore,2,Sun Jul 19 10:18:03 2015 UTC,"But then you have the Boltons getting fed up and him, essentially, screwing over the Frey's."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Rosebunse,5,Sun Jul 19 14:51:01 2015 UTC,He should have listened to his advisers more and adopted more of the role of figurehead for the North.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,supahmonkey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:12:00 2015 UTC,Robb was the mvp of the war until his wife showed up imo. Almost all of his bad choices followed her arrival.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,thejewfro69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:50 2015 UTC,"You know, he had a mind of his own. He choose to marry her."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Rosebunse,2,Sun Jul 19 23:20:07 2015 UTC,I know. He was too undisciplined to resist.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,thejewfro69,16,Mon Jul 20 03:09:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of Robb's mistakes come across as overtly driven by authorial intent and thus very convenient for his enemies. Never mind the fact that Robb had a much smaller army, fought against better funded, better positioned and better fed enemies, or that he somehow failed to rally the lords of the Vale as his allies against the Lannisters or the fact that Balon Greyjoy was a complete fucking idiot that attacked barren North instead of the bountiful, and more importantly, vulnerable Westerlands - Robb at the same had to deal with oatbreakers and treasoners in his ranks.  Rickard Karstark murdered captives under his king's protection, thus committing treason, and then insulted him. He had to die, otherwise his cause for justice would be for empty and he'd be known as a hypocritical king that wouldn't punish murders in his own ranks - something which Ned would have surely done.   I don't think Robb trusted in Walder Frey, he had a due cause to be wary of him, but I don't think anyone could have expected Guest Right to be violated, let alone that Roose Bolton would have a hand in it.  Robb made mistakes, but the odds were stacked against him arguably more than anyone else in the entire series."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Praeventore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:27:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the Karstark needed to die and that what he had done was nothing short of treason. You even said it yourself though, Robb did not have enough troops to begin with. Being king is about sacrifices and compromises. Robb kills the Karstark, loses all of the Karstark men, and doesn't listen to anyone's advice on the matter because he believes in loyalty to trump all. Now here's the thing, if Robb was actually loyal then this would have worked out for him. He would have gone to the Frey camp, explained that his forces need bolstering and if we are to believe that Walder Frey broke Guest Right because Robb broke his betrothal, everything would have been fine. Instead we have to pretend Robb is as good as the word he preaches and watch as he dies for it."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,robieman,5,Sun Jul 19 18:45:21 2015 UTC,"but Renly had 0 talent or experience in war, Robb had no experience but was a cunning man for war, and Stannis had both experience and talent for war."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,2,Sun Jul 19 08:08:20 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way. Renly was loved, but had no talent for war. Stannis had talent for war but was not loved. Robb was both loved and talented in warfare."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Praeventore,9,Sun Jul 19 10:12:25 2015 UTC,I think lack of experience as a man overall plays a big role in Robb's downfall
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:40:49 2015 UTC,It certainly did not help. He also had some really convenient Lannister plot armour to contend with.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Praeventore,6,Sun Jul 19 11:05:38 2015 UTC,To be fair every big character of game of thrones has some sort of plot armor...until they dont.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:20:20 2015 UTC,"To some degree, perhaps, but certianly not as much as the Lannisters."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Praeventore,5,Sun Jul 19 11:32:59 2015 UTC,"Tell that to Joffrey, Cercei's daughter and Tywin hehehe, also depends who you compare it to. Starks have the worst armor of all houses, while Dany has like legendary plot army. Lannisters have suffered losses, and its foreshadowed that every cercei kid will die and then she will die choked.  If Tyrion ends up being not being a Lannister, then the Lannisters might be the second big house to go extinct after Baratheon"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,8,Sun Jul 19 11:36:04 2015 UTC,"The Lannisters ran out of plot armour after the Starks were dealt with. Up until that they were extraordinary lucky, considering the North, Riverlands, Vale, Stormlands, Reach, Iron Islands and Dorne were either all in open rebellion and/or despised the Lannisters and wanted them dead but didn't band together or even considered attacking them when they were vulnerable.  Somehow * the Vale remained neutral, even though that still treason as the Crown needed them, and despite the fact that lords of the Vale could have at least sent a token force to help avenge Ned, a man they loved and respected and who was a son to their liege lord * Balon Greyjoy chose to attack the barren North coastlines when the rich and vulnerable Westerlands were ripe for the taking * the Dornish despised the Lannisters more than any house and could have declared for either Renly or Stannis, but didn't - yeah, they fought against the Baratheons and Starks during Robert's Rebellion but they don't seem to hate either * Edmure Tully just happened to not understand what Robb meant by ""Hold Riverrun"" and gave chase to Lannister forces, thus ruining Robb's plan of trapping them and allowing them to conveniently meet and strike an alliance with the Tyrells. * & so much more convenient shit  The Lannisters are suffering their own comeuppance now, as it was planned by GRRM, but up until that point, they were extraordinarily lucky."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Praeventore,5,Sun Jul 19 12:01:12 2015 UTC,"The Valle wouldnt send forces because its the dumb bitch that its in charge, and she is being puppetered by Littlefinger from long before. She poisoned her husband on his command and set up his sister to start a war. The Vale is not being run by competent people anymore, also it was Robert and Ned that lived on the valle and started the rebellion. The actual Valle armies arent generally involved when it comes to political affairs.  Balon Greyjoy doesnt have a ounce of love for Starks, he didnt gracefully pledge alliance to baratheon and starks, his knee was bent forcefully and his sons killed during the rebellion, when he wanted to be independent. You cant pin Balon's own ploys on Lannister plot armor. Balon has always been rebellious and had his own agenda.  As you can see this season, Dorne king has his own plan on what to do. He just doesnt want a open rebellion to start up and damage Dornish people, open war is not the ""Dornish way"". What Oberyn and Doran's full plan was in kingslanding we will never know. Im sure whatever they planned got delayed by Oberyn's death  As far as Edmure Tully, at least in the show he is clearly incompetent and eager to prove his worth, which makes for a bad combination.  Still, you have to admit that even if you call what happens to them luck. You still have to set yourself up to be lucky. Of all the houses in westeros, they are the ones that are playing the Game of Thrones the hardest. Every single Lannister plays the game and affects the future of their family and the political situation (excluding the smaller children for obvious reasons)."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:53:19 2015 UTC,"Renly surrounded himself with people who did understand war, so what difference does it make? The only reason he lost was because Stannis played dirty."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheReaver88,2,Sun Jul 19 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"well, nothing about war is about playing clean. There are no rules in war. Trying to play clean in a war, can potentially get you killed"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"Stannis talks big about honor and doing things the right way, and then he pulls that shit? Come on, you can't tell me that Renly didn't know enough about warfare, and that's why he was assassinated by dark magic. Enough of the Stannis worship. He played dirty. We all give Frey and Bolton shit about it, but when Stannis pulls a trick on his own brother, it's okay."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,TheReaver88,2,Sun Jul 19 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"Renly as a matter of fact didnt know how to do war, i dont think he ever lead a body to war.  Also Renly was the one waging war against his own brother. Stannis claim is the truthful one, Ned knew so and was working to giving him the throne, had Lannisters not been such pieces of shits, or Ned been more cunning he would have siezed joffrey and cercei, gave the throne to Stannis. Renly should have done the same, the honor bounded him to respect the line of succession.   So Renly cant just disrespect honor and the bitch about ""b-b-but that isnt honorable Stannis"""
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,15,Sun Jul 19 19:04:30 2015 UTC,"Stannis was the master of ships, and was respected by the ship captains, that is way the majority of his power came from his navy."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,kingstoken,10,Sat Jul 18 23:37:16 2015 UTC,Not to mention Davos would jump off a bridge if Stannis asked.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,JosefStallion,2,Sun Jul 19 02:26:59 2015 UTC,Practically like Balon Greyjoy.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Laese,26,Sun Jul 19 22:14:51 2015 UTC,And yet he was right about everything else in that scene. Had him and Ned taken Joffrey hostage like he suggested who knows how the entire series would have turned out
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,lllAMGlll,13,Sat Jul 18 23:45:44 2015 UTC,Or if Ned had gone to Dragonstone after finding out Joffrey's parentage instead of telling people...

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,guitarguy13093,4,Sun Jul 19 08:45:46 2015 UTC,Close enough.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,supahmonkey,13,Sun Jul 19 09:04:39 2015 UTC,It really seemed like telling ANYBODY except for Cersei would have been beneficial

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,LameHam,2,Mon Jul 20 00:23:24 2015 UTC,It's funny because I watched the show first and still liked Stannis. Can only imagine how much more I'd like him if I read the books.
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,KR4549,53,Mon Jul 20 00:39:39 2015 UTC,"TV show: Renly was right in the end, most of Stannis' army simply abandons him, and the ones that stay are mostly just Rhllor fanatics that have faith in Rhllor, not Stannis  Books: Stannis himself admits that he doesn't inspire people  So yeah, Renly was definitely correct, Stannis doesn't really inspire any loyalty"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,bat-affleck,20,Sun Jul 19 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, after he burned Shirley, the soldiers with a stint of loyalty to stannis abandoned him.. Those who stayed were loyal to lord of lights, and only stayed because stannis were supposedly the ""chosen one""   Stannis & Renly would be a great unbeatable pair and would reclaim king's Landing in no time.. Too bad  Renly was too ambitious to see that. (Can't blame stannis, he was the next in line)"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,MrThomasWeasel,25,Sun Jul 19 04:55:11 2015 UTC,Shirley? For real?

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,2rio2,4,Sun Jul 19 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"Or that fact that Stannis only even had this army by assassinating his brother and stealing half of his. When he called his bannermen and the other lords to join him at the start of the War of Five Kings NO ONE showed up. Why? Because he doesn't inspire loyalty when give alternate choices, other than to Davos who has a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome and Mel who is literally wrong about fucking everything."

So while he might have characteristics that beget loyalty, its a dull loyalty.  He's not inspiring people left and right with heart-filled speeches and parades and tournaments. His loyalty is earned more slowly than someone as inspiring as celebratory as Renly, but he still has men willing to die for him.  No other army would have lasted through those conditions 'til the end like Stannis'."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,KR4549,-10,Sun Jul 19 04:01:06 2015 UTC,"Stannis' army didn't last either, they abandoned him"

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,promefeeus,9,Sun Jul 19 07:29:25 2015 UTC,"Loyalty comes in shades of grey, and you think its black and white. Stannis's men abandoned him in a dark, dark shade of grey. Even then, many stayed. I'm arguing that most other armies loyalty would lead them to abandon during a much lighter shade of grey, they'd never see things through as far as Stannis's army did."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,KR4549,-12,Sun Jul 19 07:53:56 2015 UTC,"No, it's pretty binary  Either they deserted or they did not  And they did"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,promefeeus,8,Sun Jul 19 08:10:49 2015 UTC,"No one said they didn't. Forget it I can see you don't want to dive any further into the discussion of character loyalties, you're stubbornly defending a point that no one disagrees with you on as if that is what everyone else is talking about."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,KR4549,-14,Sun Jul 19 08:21:01 2015 UTC,So in other words... Stannis didn't have a loyal army  Agreed
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Rosebunse,5,Sun Jul 19 08:21:49 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, look at what happened. He had loyal men, but then he overplayed how loyal they would be in the face of him burning his daughter alive."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,flipdark95,8,Sun Jul 19 10:48:42 2015 UTC,"The sellswords he hired were the ones that left, everyone else stayed."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,3,Sun Jul 19 02:25:07 2015 UTC,"those arent his loyal man, those are sellswords he got with Bravosi money. Most of his army died at Blackwater Bay. Sellswords are just loyal to gold, they arent loyal fighters.  Stannis last army is probably the most prone to desertion out of all armies in the history of GoT, composed mostly of Sellswords, and even after all he did he still kept about half of them loyal. It speaks well to his commanding personality. I would have liked to see others on his situation, probably would have gotten killed on his sleep"

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,lokitheinane,20,Mon Jul 20 02:05:19 2015 UTC,"loyalty is always, always on a sliding scale. there's not binary of ""I will flay my own children alive if you ask"" and ""worthless and untrustworthy"".   I mean, davos repeatedly does what he thinks is right like letting gendry go, but nobody accuses him of disloyalty. A wise commander knows how loyal his men are, and doesn't ask them to go beyond that. if the standard is ""loyalty is doing whatever somebody says, no matter what it is"" then nobody is loyal to anything."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,robieman,6,Sun Jul 19 03:20:36 2015 UTC,"yeah the loyalty also needs to be judged relative to others armies. Would any other army in westeros have gone through the exact same thing Stannis's army did and stick with their leader? the fact that stannis still had half his force is a true tribute to how he led, the Tyrell's (I cant say about the Tarly forces but certainly Loras's army), Renly, the lannisters, even Robb wouldn't have had anything left at that point. Perhaps Ned and the old breed would have but Stannis was what was left of them."

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,KR4549,-8,Sun Jul 19 08:16:00 2015 UTC,"There was no test of their loyalty.  They showed up to one battle and got wiped out  And actually, you're pretty far wrong, a decent portion of his army at blackwater deserts the minute ""Renly's ghost"" (Lorasl Tyrell in the TV show, his brother in ACOK) shows up with Tywin"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:19:02 2015 UTC,"well the battle was lost, even Stannis retreated and they got blindsided by the Wildfire attack. A attack that massive to his ranks has to cause miscommunication. Every army loses people during a war, a lot of people go with it but realize in the middle of battle they dont want to die. As you would expect, is normal human nature to not try to club each others to death over other peoples motives.  Also your ""there was not test of loyalty"" holds no water, we can only go by what is shown to us. There are no loyalty test to most armies in GoT because that isnt the point of the story and because sometimes recounting how many people left doesnt hold any bearing to future conversations relevant to what needs to be told.  Game of Thrones has about 25+ storylines which it has to tell the more important details. There is no hope to cover every single detail of every single conversation and every single scenario. That isnt how story telling works"

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Gammaran,2,Sun Jul 19 08:40:53 2015 UTC,"its obvious that is going to happen, most of his real army died at blackwater bay. That army he got was mostly sellswords brought with Braavosi money. The army he marched to blackwater im sure would not have deserted him.  As Bronn often says, Sellswords loyalty is to the gold they are paid. They arent diehard loyal fighters, they just want to make a living of killing."

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,redditisadamndrug,7,Sun Jul 19 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"Ironically, Renly didn't inspire any loyalty. As soon as he died half his army went to the Lannisters and half went to Stannis."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Matt-D,9,Sun Jul 19 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of people don't talk about how Renly doesn't inspire much loyalty. Other than Brienne & Loras, the cavalry Renly brought defects to Stannis. They weren't loyal they just back whoever they think is the winning horse.  Stannis has got Davos & Melisandre, Renly had Loras & Brienne. They also get other guys in the books that are strangely devoted to them.  The Starks however have the magical ability to make people loyal. Despite all the Starks being dead or missing there are several families who are still fighting in their name. Stannis gets the letter from the Mormonts telling him to get lost they only follow ""one king in the north whose name is STARK"" In the books Jaime doesn't go to Dorne he goes to the riverland to get the riverlords still fighting for Robb to surrender."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,superior_wombat,9,Sun Jul 19 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"That's not strictly true. Renly was able to raise the entire Stormlands and The Reach. The Reach is the most populous of the Seven Kingdoms with the most lords and the largest army. Renly was able to raise all of these except for the Florents who sided with Stannis due to his wife. Renly's supporters only defected to Stannis because in their eyes, Stannis was Renly's heir so would be the heir to the throne. Both Renly's and Stannis' claim relied on the fact that Robert's children were Lannister bastards, meaning that the heir after Renly would be Stannis."
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Johanneskodo,4,Sun Jul 19 11:34:21 2015 UTC,"Almost all of the Reach and Stormlands fought for Renly, including House Florent, the family of Stannis' fucking wife.  He had the largest army, and would have had the largest fleet as well had the Redwyne twins not been in King's Landing.  Even after he died, the Tyrells (and most of the Reach as result) went over to the Lannisters to get vengeance for Renly, Brienne's still loyal to Renly, and the Storm's End garrison didn't give up either after Renly's death.  Stannis on the other hand had almost no one fight for his cause in the beginning, after Blackwater Bay most of his army left him, and even now all the Northmen would ditch him in a second were ADWD to be found"
gameofthrones,3ds4sg,rhomsarama,5,Sun Jul 19 13:55:50 2015 UTC,I think he was referring to his relationship with other lords and the smallfolk.  He acknowledges that Stannis is a great military commander/motivator.

gameofthrones,3ds4sg,Seansz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:48:20 2015 UTC,Plus the portion of his army that wasn't mercenaries didn't leave him even after he burnt a child at the stake.

Stannis - Doesn't have the charisma to attract more man power to his side Renly - For him was just all a game, wasn't paying attention to the politics at all, he could have done much better and i don't think he would have made a great commander in a battle, he doesn't seem like. Robb - Had great charisma, he was admire by people, had a great mind for war, had honor which also mostly kill him, but his inexperience in the politics got him a nice little head.  It would have been nice to see how Ned Stark rules an army, i think the North would have howl at the KL doors if Ned was ruling, he had experience, charisma, he was from what we know a great tactician too, and he fights alongside his man, him ruling with Robb as his hand, would have been enough to kneel Tywyn without too much problem."

gameofthrones,3dqy40,Yerac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:31 2015 UTC,Jojen's words are consistent with Jon being stabbed on the wrong side of the wall.

The fact that there is so much more evidence lends to support each individual piece when read in context. If you don't understand what I'm saying then you probably don't understand the theory well enough.   One quote without any outside support is legitimately a reach because there's nothing else in the books to make us believe it's true."
gameofthrones,3dqy40,Yerac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:27:37 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of George R.Rs writing style. There is a lot left ambiguous and up to the reader to make his interpretation. It's as simple as that. We will never know 100% what ""the wrong side of the wall"" is if we don't ask the man himself that wrote the book. If OP want to think that the words means that castle black is the wrong side then it's a very plausible theory.  One bit of the puzzle might be Alliser who said that Jon lost all his friend, which hints that he's instead surrounded by enemies. Stannis also made a point about Jon having enemies. One example of a person being north of the wall is Bran and you can say that he's on the right side.  You people are biased here. Nothing else to say. This sub is filled with too many people who have never read books in their entire life except for ASOIAF. This is also why I would never tell others about my interpretation, because people feel the need to prove their own view over others."

gameofthrones,3dqy40,BetaFoxtrot,-18,Sat Jul 18 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would agree- it seems the more logical interpretation at the time we see it that he is referring to the wildlings and being north of the wall. But good foreshadowing is hidden, not blatant.  I really don't think it's out of the question (or even a stretch), especially given the importance and fickle nature of prophecy in GoT, that this was deliberate foreshadowing of the betrayal at Castle Black. I think the fact that Bran brings up Castle Black and it isn't explicitly rejected reinforces the theory, rather than hinders it."
gameofthrones,3dqy40,BetaFoxtrot,20,Sat Jul 18 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, it's a pretty big stretch. We're talking about a full two seasons before there's any threat to Jon at Castle Black, while there's a much more explicit threat to Jon at the moment of that quote. I think you're seeing what you want to see, I would be absolutely shocked if this was intended to foreshadow the mutiny, especially considering that there's really no way Jojen would consider Castle Black ""the wrong side of the wall"". It just doesn't make sense."
gameofthrones,3dqy40,knight4646,-14,Sat Jul 18 21:40:42 2015 UTC,"I touch on ""right"" vs. ""wrong"" here a bit.

gameofthrones,3dqy40,nighthawk763,3,Sat Jul 18 23:17:33 2015 UTC,Jojen tends to see what was or what will be. So it's logical to think he's seeing a future event not a current event

This could be interpreted in two ways:   Jon is North of The Wall, surrounded by Wildlings Jon is South of The Wall which is the 'safe' side, and therefore it is 'wrong' for him to be surrounded by enemies.

gameofthrones,3dqy40,petrichorE6,-69,Sat Jul 18 20:28:04 2015 UTC,I would contend that the only time Jon was truly surrounded (Read: devoid of allies and encircled by enemies) by enemies was at Castle Black during the betrayal.  EDIT: Another counterpoint: Jojen was having a nightmare- why would he be having a fit if it was just one of the situations that Jon Snow escaped from completely unscathed?
gameofthrones,3dqy40,AngryCrowTF,71,Sat Jul 18 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"But that was on the right side of the Wall, so Jojen wasn't talking about that. Castle Black isn't beyond the Wall."

gameofthrones,3dqy40,AChanceRay,56,Sat Jul 18 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"I would certainly want to be south of the wall. Jojen, however, is unflinching in the importance of getting Bran north of the wall to meet the three-eyed raven. As such, he knows that's the ""right"" side for Bran.   Perhaps he also knows that it's the ""right"" side for Jon. He's not exactly a straight shooter in how he communicates throughout the series."
gameofthrones,3dqy40,Mattosity,6,Sat Jul 18 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"He's talking about Jon, so he definitely talks about ""Wrong side of the wall"" from Jon's perspective. He should be South of the Wall in Castle Black, not in Wildling camp."
gameofthrones,3dqy40,Nimtolien712,41,Sat Jul 18 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"Jon fell in love north of the wall and killed his lover south of it. Jon was treated with dignity by Mance Rayder north of The Wall and with derision by members of the Night's Watch and the highborn south of it. As Jon makes allies with the wildlings north of The Wall, he turns the entire night's watch into enemies south of it. Jon swore his vows in front of the weirwood & to the old gods. And, most notably, Jon was stabbed south of The Wall.  I'm not convinced that south is ""right"" for Jon, as much as he's led to believe it is."
gameofthrones,3dqy40,novacolumbia,-4,Sat Jul 18 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"But this isn't about which is the right side for Jon, it's about which one's the right side for Jojen.  Edit: Also, they possibly couldn't have known how Jon actually felt about the wildlings, so it really doesn't matter what Jon thinks. What matters, is that Bran asks Jojen, that is Jon at Castle Black, and so Jojen replies to him that Jon is on the wrong side of the wall."

Which means, it's pretty easy to make prophecy fit, especially if that ""prophecy"" was meant to use Jojen to get Bran to Bloodraven. Bran is hugely important to Bloodraven, they have been communicating on some level since before Bran's accident.  These events were set in motion by individuals/beings long before the story started.  Melisandre fucks up prophecy likes it's her job.  Bran misunderstands his dreams constantly.  Dany is shown all sorts of ""prophecy"" that doesn't come true.  Prophecy, in GoT, is more bullshit, misdirection and personal agenda than anything. Not to mention, no one can tell the future. No one. GRRM is not an idiot."

Jojen has some abilities, like Bran, that are totally separate from the sent dreams I mentioned earlier.  If there is one thing that is most definitely for sure, it's that no character in ASOIAF can tell the future for certain.  Just because Jojen saw his own death, doesn't mean he saw the future.

gameofthrones,3dtqgy,therapy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:07 2015 UTC,I agree with that. I don't think he'll come back exactly the same personality wise because that's what happens to everyone that is brought back; as Beric says each revival takes a little more away every time. But I don't think he'll have curdled white skin like some other revived characters from the story/books; I don't think he'll stay dead long because I don't see the show runners making Jon look like a zombie if he were to come back. He can't be left to rot and decay like LSH floating down a river for 3 days. That is unless the revival process somehow just undoes any decay process because it's magic; I suppose if that were the case then the timeline for his revival is whatever they want but otherwise Jon is going to need to happen somewhat quickly. With the end game bearing I don't imagine we'll. we getting a ton of slow buildup in the time we have left.

gameofthrones,3dtqgy,trplingup,11,Sun Jul 19 15:21:29 2015 UTC,I was thinking Bran would be the one to tell Jon about his lineage but now that I think about it Reed makes more sense.
gameofthrones,3dtqgy,LeBronnJamie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:06:15 2015 UTC,"I doubt it would be Bran - there's just too many hurdles to jump for that to happen.  For them to talk, either Bran would have to leave the cave (unlikely, since he spent like 3 seasons just getting there and it wouldn't make any sense for him to leave again so soon) or Jon would have to go there.  For Jon to go there, he'd first have to learn the location of the cave, and THEN decide it's worth trudging hundreds (?) of miles through snow past hoards of undead to visit / rescue Bran.  If rescuing Bran was such a high priority for Jon, he would have made some kind of effort to do so after Sam told him Bran was beyond the wall.  The only other way they could 'talk' would be through warging, but it seems like a stretch for Bran to go from being able to take control of a simpleton a few feet away to a regular person hundreds of miles away.  And that is precluded on Bran someone 'seeing' Jon be born (in the south, far from any wierwood tree) and realize that it's Jon, which also seems like a stretch."
gameofthrones,3dtqgy,SyrousStarr,4,Mon Jul 20 01:22:15 2015 UTC,Bran is able to communicate through wierwoods. All it would take for Jon to be next to one. But I don't think he would be able to see the tower of joy through wierwoods.

Considering all five other companions that came along with Ned got killed, it wasn't luck that Howland lived. Not to mention Ned says that if it weren't for Howland, Arthur Dayne would have killed him. With what we know about Dayne's skill in combat I have a hard time believing that Howland sort of ""accidentally"" killed the most skilled swordsman in Westeros. I definitely agree, he wasn't the best fighter around, but he was probably at least decent."

gameofthrones,3dtqgy,Orngarth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying any of this as a slight to Howland.  The weaker and more terrified he was during the fight at the Tower of Joy, the more brave he would have had to have been to win.  I'm not saying Howland got lucky or accidentally killed Arthur Dayne.  He could have, sure, but he could compensate for his lack of fighting skill by being smart.  Consider Samwell Tarly at the Battle of Castle Black.  He knew his limitations, so stayed at the edge of the battle and did what he could to help.  He was useful to his allies and he survived.  Howland Reed is the man whose fortress has never been conquered, because no army can find it.   He's clever.  But he's also the guy who was specifically bullied by squires, so he's not a skilled fighter like Ned.  Nonetheless, I can see Ned and Howland being the last two alive in a fight, just as I can see Jon and Samwell being the last two alive.  One the most skilled, the other the most clever.  When Howland was forced to face Arthur one on one, I suspect he somehow outsmarted him.  I also suspect Arthur failed to realize that Howland was more afraid of failing the Starks than we has of Arthur.  This could be Howland's, ""I don't care what I lose of my body and soul, I can not let you win.""  The fight could still be epic (perhaps moreso) if Howland is scared out of his mind, but still facing down Arthur Dayne to save the Starks.  *Edit: typo"

It was said that they were a cowardly people who fought with poisoned weapons and preferred to hide from foes rather than face them in open battle.

Who is 14 years old at the time? Jon. And why does Ned keep thinking about Lyanna's promise at random times if it was just that she wanted to be buried at Winterfell? Ned brought her home and she lays there still, I don't see why Ned would still worry over her promise if he fulfilled it… This leads to the interpretation that it must be something more profound, like ""promise me, Ned, that you'll protect mine and Rhaegar's child."" Because when someone asks you to promise them something it usually implies it's something you'd rather not do, for example raise a child claimant to the throne that could one day usurp your BFF and his family."

The problem with Jon being dead is that there are a ton of loose threads and promises made by the Author which have not been delivered. There's so much mystery around Jon and his lineage and so much time/emphasis was spent setting this up that to just abandon it makes no sense.   However, for the sake of this conversation lets assume Jon is Dead. Whos PoV will we follow to display what happens North of the wall with the others? Tormund and Davos are great candidates for this. We already know Davos has a great mind to lead and now that he has truly lost everything he holds dear, would he turn to the watch? Lord Commander Davos hype anyone (highly doubt this happens but this is in the case that Jon is dead)??   Another way to continue exploring the White Walker incursion would be through Tormund. Tormund is now essentially the leader of the white walkers. Once he hears what has happened to Jon, the wildlings could make quick work of the remaining Night's Watch since they are on the right side of the wall now.

People can come to the House of Black and White to get the gift of death. They can ask it for themselves and they will recieve it.  However, people can also ask the gift for someone else. If they do this, they have to offer up a sacrifice. What sort of sacrifice depends on two factors:    How important is the target? If you want them to kill a king, then this will cost you considerably more than if you just want them to kill some random dude. How much do you have to offer? Someone who only owns one golden coin might offer it up. But for someone who is rich, one golden coin would be no true sacrifice, they would have to pay much more. Even someone who has nothing might offer up to serve the Many-Faced God for life.

It is unknown whether Faceless Men also get the orders from somewhere else, other than a person offering a sacrifice.

The Faceless Men are a respected assassination guild and religion, and her killing Trant so ruthlessly makes them all look bad. On top of that, what if she'd died and Trant realized what technique she was using? It would have looked very, very bad for all of the Faceless Men to be considered enemies of the Throne of Westeros.   I mean, it's not like Arya was treated badly by them, was she? She was given nice clothes, a safe bed, relatively easy work, and wasn't beaten too badly for her mess-ups. By the standards of that country, she was treated very, very well. And then she just disrespects their hospitality by stealing one of their Faces. Really, if going blind was the worst that happened to her, I'd say she got off easy."

gameofthrones,3dtnrd,Rosebunse,9,Sun Jul 19 14:09:46 2015 UTC,Woh ! Can't imagine someone hating arya .
gameofthrones,3dtnrd,Jasper-Caska,10,Sun Jul 19 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"I actually don't see why everyone loves her so much. She's really not that mature, and while I totally understand why she has a hit-list, her taking everything so personally isn't a good thing. It's very self-destructive.   Personally, I think Sansa is the stronger one simply because she managed to put-aside some of her own grudges for the sake of her own survival."
gameofthrones,3dtnrd,Rosebunse,10,Sun Jul 19 15:24:19 2015 UTC,"Arya is a child. Personally I think her writing is some of the best there is. Of course she isn't mature and she is somewhat self destructive. That's what people like about her. She is a kid dealing with some seriously heavy crap. She isn't going to deal with it well and in fact is probably dealing with it better than most adults would. People like Arya because her character is easily relatable. People also like her because her story arc so far most closely resembles the stereotypical story arcs we are used to seeing. ( with Dany's being a detestably more cliched story arc)  If they had Arya making more sound judgements and using more rational thinking it would ruin her character. Once again a child ( or tween if you prefer, just know I shuddered even typing that word) isn't going to make sound decisions and it would make her character feel more fake.  For proof look at Dany who is about Sansa's age. Not to get into that whole can of worms but look at this very reddit page, lots of people hate her."
gameofthrones,3dtnrd,Tiranasta,4,Sun Jul 19 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"I don't really like Dany all that much.  That being said, I also think some of the Dany hate is oddly displaced. She's a young woman playing to be queen, and of course she's going to make mistakes.  My problem is when people get all mad at Dany and Sansa for their mistakes, but then Arya gets a free pass to be an idiot and endanger those around her."
gameofthrones,3dtnrd,Jasper-Caska,3,Sun Jul 19 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Dany or Sansa hater, but it's perfectly possible to hate a character while still acknowledging that the character is well written and that the aspects of the character you dislike are realistic and understandable."
gameofthrones,3dtnrd,Rosebunse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:33 2015 UTC,I see your points. I think the pass Arya is given is because of her small scale nature. Arya is a support character through and through. We like her and want her to succeed but she is not a major player. She can and probably will kill important people but that's it. That is her story.  Dany is a huge player. so when plot contrivances occur to strengthen her position time and time again and its obvious she has plot armor people start to sour. I am not saying its fair but Arya is just a small fish in some ways so its easy to forgive the lack of consequences. Coupled with the fact that her plot boons are minor compared to someone like Dany's and it sways people's opinions about similarly poor judgement decision.   Edit: also Arya's mistakes are going to maybe get a few people killed. Dany's mistakes can and have led to the death of thousands of people. Scale is important.

Yes, Arya lived through many, many awful, horrible things, but does that really make her focus on killing so many people healthy? Or right?"

Asshai'i are described as having a dark and solemn appearance.[5] The Dothraki believe that Asshai'i are ""spawn of shadows"" and hold them in contempt and fear.[6]  There are no children in Asshai, and all who dwell there wear masks or veils and, oft as not, walk alone or ride in palanquins of ebony an iron, hidden behind dark curtains and carried upon the backs of slaves.

gameofthrones,3dubhg,StraightToThePoint1,5,Sun Jul 19 22:49:15 2015 UTC,"Aside from the obvious (it's magic, GRRM said so), I like the theory that a supermassive planet exists within the ASoIaF's star system.  Most of the time, it would have no impact on the ""regular"" seasons (as far as crops are concerned) of the planet, and the supermassive planet wouldn't appear notably different from a regular star in the sky.  Every now and then (at essentially unpredictable intervals to people with Westeros' technology level), the supermassive planet would come closer.  To the inhabitants of Westeros, it would look like a fairly bright object in the sky... maybe like a red comet?  The supermassive planet's gravity pull then makes the ASoIaF planet's orbit irregular, but always within (just barely) the outer edge of their star's Goldilocks zone, leading to long periods of glaciation with equally unpredictable (but not permanent) lengths."
gameofthrones,3dubhg,TheFarnell,3,Sun Jul 19 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"The theory offered below that GRRM's Earth orbits a binary star system falls at the first hurdle – if this were so, then everyone in the books would see two suns in the sky. And they don't.  I have offered a theory somewhere else on this board (or another, don't remember) and it goes like this:  For there to be seasons in the first place, (and, therefore, easily observable calendar years) the spin axis of the planet must be tilted like our own (Earth is tilted 23.5°). Whether the orbit around the sun were circular or elliptical, these seasons would still be regular annual cycles – more or less same length summers and winters each calendar year. The only explanation of long summers and winters, surely, is a very short-cycle alternation between glacial and interglacial periods. Here on Earth, glacial periods occur about every 100,000 years and are very regular (see: http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/Temperature_Interglacials.gif Graph from Vostock ice cores, Antartica) Scientists still cannot say for certain what regulates these cycles on Earth so, if this is the explanation, the fact that these cycles on Westeros are much shorter in general and completely irregular makes it even harder to explain the cause."

gameofthrones,3dvs4m,SnowWight,4,Sun Jul 19 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"Sort of. We see Bran, Jon and Arya warg in the books. We have it from GRRM that they all have the ability to a certain degree, but Robb and Rickon don't have POV chapters.   I don't think anyone but Bran can warg on the show. There's been no indication of it."

gameofthrones,3dvs4m,Lord_NiteShade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:08 2015 UTC,Indirectly   But it was confirmed by Grrm in SO SPAKE MARTIN.
gameofthrones,3dvs4m,-Kermit-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"To add on to that so as to more accurately answer the question: all Stark children have the ability to, but only Bran is able to acknowledge it, and do it consciously. The others do it subconsciously when they are sleeping, but don't actually know they're in it for real. This is why in the show, only Bran can do it, because it's the most important to his character."
gameofthrones,3dvs4m,SexualWeasel,3,Mon Jul 20 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"I actually believe there is a part in the books where the one Wildling warg with the POV Prologue for ADWD states that he knows Jon is a warg, yet Jon may not know it. I could be completely wrong."

gameofthrones,3dvs4m,jelliknight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"In the show no one except Bran and that one wildling has ever warged, so It'd be pretty odd for Jon to discover he can do it too in the moment before his death."
gameofthrones,3dvs4m,BlushingWallFlower,2,Mon Jul 20 05:35:14 2015 UTC,I don't know why this was downvoted because it is very accurate. non-book readers would think the show jumped the shark if he suddenly slammed into Ghost after no previous dream experiences were depicted on camera the way Bran's were.
gameofthrones,3dvs4m,jelliknight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"It gets downvoted because people want to believe that Jons alive. I don't see any way he can come back in the start of season 6 that's not ridiculous.   Wargs into ghost? ""Oh hey, while i was dying I just discovered that I have this extremely rare magical talent that I've never had before, and that the only other two people who can do it have been doing since they were very young kids. Lucky me, right?"" -Jon Mel resurrects him? ""Oh hey, i just discovered that I have this extremely rare gift that we've only seen used once before on the show, by one guy, that I've never used before when it would have been very helpful and that I didn't think was even possible. I'm going to resurrect this guy I just happen to stumble onto at the exact right moment, and he's totally not just going to get killed right away again by the same guys who still hate him."" - Mel Medical intervention? 17 stab wounds is totally survivable while one stab with a bore's tusk isn't.   Maybe Mel carts his body away in secret, and spends two seasons figuring out how to resurrect people and then resurrects Jon for the show finale. That'd make some kind of sense at least."
gameofthrones,3dvs4m,BlushingWallFlower,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an idiotic reason to downvote someone's perfectly sensible comment.  Yeah it isn't going to be an easy move if they make it. This is going to be  ""plot armour trickery and backpeddling"" or ""he ded, you'll get over it"". The latter seems to fit better. But seriously I want Jon to live. LIVE JON! DAMN YOU, LIVE!  I am 50/50 on Mel resurrecting him. it is AWFULLY CONVENIENT that she showed up at the wall, when she could have fled anywhere. Why go back to the wall? So I don't know."
gameofthrones,3dvs4m,jelliknight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"It is silly, but it happens constantly and that's the only explanation I can think of.  I've made a hypothesis about what might happen. I don't know if Jon's coming back. He might. It does seem like his parentage might come into play somewhere because they've brought it up a few times (Stannis saying Ned wouldn't cheat or something like that last season), but he doesn't necessarily have to be alive for that to be a plot point. Also, sometimes we get a big futures built up for people and then it just gets taken away. I'm rewatching season one right now and there's been just as much, if not more, build up for Drogo to start a war and become king than there has ever been for Snow to become king. Sometimes people get their future's taken away from them for silly reasons like infections and poor PR skills.  My counterargument to 'Jon snow gets up in S6E1 because it was just strawberry jam he was covered with and everything's ok because that's the only way I can see the show could go forward' was this;  Mel DID come back because she thought Jon was the one her prophesies were about. She's going to declare it publicly and then someone going to point out that he's dead and Mel is going to be fucking crushed and completely doubting her abilities. Absolutely defeated, hopeless, and with no reason to stay in this foreign land, where's she going to go? Home to Essos. Where she might just happen to meet someone who was reborn among smoke and salt. The only way for Mel to find the real Azor Ahai is for Jon to be dead and gone.  What's Davos going to do now? He's got nothing left, he's utterly crushed too. What does a man do when he's got nothing left? Join the Nightswatch. Davos is a good tactition, he'll be valuable to them. Shit's going to start falling apart for them very quickly now that Snow's dead, the wildings are going to flip out and attack them and the surrounding towns, and assuming Alister Thorne becomes commander (you know he wants it) he's going to be absolutely crap at the negotiations and tactics needed to resolve it. He's going to get a bunch of people killed, probably himself too. Davos steps up as Commander of the watch. Then we have someone with experience in siege tactics in charge of the wall when the others finally attack. This can only happen if Jon is out of the picture for good.  As for 'ice and fire', there's plenty of other starks or notherners that Dany could marry if that needed to happen. And Ice and Fire could just as easily refer to the two battles that westeros will be fighting by the end; one against Dany and her dragons, one against the others.  So what do we really need Jon for at all? So he can marry his Aunt? Dany doesn't really seem to give a damn about preserving the bloodlines, since she's already had two foreign husbands, and Jon doesn't seem like the kind of guy who'd be up for incest just because he finds out he's got Targaryan blood.  As for how Jon's parentage could still be an important point now that he's dead; if he's dead the last guy who knows about his parentage (whathisface in the books) has no reason to keep his mouth shut any more. If Dany finds out that the watch betrayed and killed her last remaining relative she's going to have a strong incentive NOT to help them when they start fighting the others for real. She'll demand that the people who killed Jon are fed to her dragons, Davos (being honourable, and after the whole thing with Shireen being burnt) won't allow that no matter how much they need the help, and Dany (knowing that she and anyone who follows her will be safe from the others because of the dragons) will let the Others just roll right over the wall. Additionally, if she finds out that Snow was her nephew and was kept safe by Ned for so many years, it also gives her an incentive to seek out any remaining stark children and protect them. Fire meets Ice.  And maybe Mel comes over with her, and when Dany returns the stark children to winterfell Mel will finally be walking along the walls of winterfell just like she saw in her vision.  So there's lot of ways it can go, and lots of ways it can only go if Jons dead. He still might come back, but the people who think he has to come back for any of it to makes sense are a bit silly I think."

And not the kind you are thinking of.  In both book and show Robb forsakes the Frey marriage for another woman. He does it to preserve her honor, at cost of his own. Taking a mistress is the ""logical"" thing to do. Lots of leaders had mistresses, even Tywin's father had several. But that compromises the woman's honor and forces her to bare the shame of raising Robb's bastard. Having seen how Jon's life was affected and how Catelyn treated him he couldnt allow his own child to go through with that.  So Robb marries a woman he loves, to protect her honor and that of their unborn child, in doing so destroying any chance he ever had of winning the North.  Robb is an amazing general, but a terrible leader. He repeated ignores good council by Catelyn, Blackfish, and even Roose. He fails to communicate his plans well leading to Edmure blowing their chance at decisively beating Tywin. He sends Theon into the wolves den (ha) by sending him to seek Balon's help and doing so in the poorest way possible. He executes Rickard Karstark trying to emulate Ned's rule, when holding him as hostage would have forced the Karhold troops to remain at his side. Marrying Jeyne Westerling/Talisa Maegyr to preserve her honor was just the last in a number of sad stupid decisions by the boy king."

gameofthrones,3duk6z,empathica1,7,Mon Jul 20 04:29:11 2015 UTC,"From what I read on a site that highlighted difference between the show and the books, this whole subplot is much better in the books.   In the books the is wounded in battle, and impregnates the girl taking care of him, Jane Westerling (iirc her name). To keep her honor, he marries her. So after a moment of weakness, he chooses to marry the girl, to preserve her honor, the honor of her family, and of their child. whoever read the books, feel free to correct me here). Basically, he chooses to make up for his weakness.  In the show, he just kinda falls head over heels in puppy love with Talisa, and decides to abandon his mother's promises to get some hot Talisa booty. Which of course comes back to bite him in the booty. Kinda feels like the opposite of his plot in the book, he forsakes honor for true love."
gameofthrones,3duk6z,Ninja_Bum,3,Sun Jul 19 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"he doesnt impregnate her, he deflowers her. when we meet her again, she isnt pregnant"
gameofthrones,3duk6z,SentientDust,2,Sun Jul 19 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"Most of these plots are better in the books and give more legitimate reasons for why they do the things they do. Jon Snow's murder makes sense in the books, Rob's marriage makes sense in the books, etc. I feel like TV directors/writers being TV focused are going to make choices that build suspense and make us cringe because that is what they learned to do in their niche of art."

gameofthrones,3dwu75,hudspud,8,Mon Jul 20 05:02:23 2015 UTC,*He hasn't done shit
gameofthrones,3dwu75,Johanneskodo,3,Mon Jul 20 07:47:23 2015 UTC,He has done a lot more than dany in regards of not staying in essos and actually going to westeros.
gameofthrones,3dwu75,Sethg119,2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:53 2015 UTC,It's not like Dany hasn't had oppotunities to go to westeros... She could have gone there but no one would support her. She is not a long lost returning prodigal child she's the daughter of the Mad King who was exiled. She will need to conquer Westeros if she intends to return which is why she is biding her time building an army of devoted followers whilst giving her dragon's time to strengthen and grow
gameofthrones,3dwu75,Johanneskodo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:46:07 2015 UTC,She had ships offered and Dorne would probably support her for obvious reasons.   That being said the part about the dragons still growing is true and smart of her. Also it would be kind of a dick move to leave after freeing all these slaves and without securing their freedom first.
gameofthrones,3dwu75,hudspud,4,Tue Jul 21 07:44:54 2015 UTC,"He is too new of a character to be a big player. Having someone who was introduced in the 5th book in a 7 book series be a major/key player just feels really cheap to the average reader. He is there more to progress other characters storylines, rather than be a player of his own. Very similar to Victarion if you think about it, although Vic has at least been around for 4 books."
gameofthrones,3dwu75,Skunkmulder,2,Mon Jul 20 07:50:41 2015 UTC,"at this point thay have twenty shows left as many as they off - they have a lot of characters the audience knows and loves.  Unless they have the casting and writing to bring another Oberyn type fan favorite - I think they are already focused on the end game..  The fact that the ""Griffs"" are not in already may indicate they are distractions to the end game."
gameofthrones,3dwu75,gtzm0stwanted,0,Mon Jul 20 11:18:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly I feel like the real reason they didn't show the new cast at comic con is because D&D have Aegon ready for this season... I think his part of the story is too big to leave out even if he's ""fAgon"". But then again they did give Jorah a part in season 5 and now I don't think we'll see Aegon but we'll find out soon. He's my favorite character in the books for sure."
gameofthrones,3dwu75,Aldebaran135,4,Mon Jul 20 07:24:31 2015 UTC,Jorah absorbed Connington and Varys is on Team Dany. I think it's clear at this point that Dany has absorbed Aegon.
gameofthrones,3dwu75,VladofWallachia1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"Well, we probably will see Euron in S6, so there's still hope for a fAegon storyline jammed in, although I don't see how Varys could be part of it. Although, now that Varys is in Mereen, they may make the Shy Maid just turn up with Varys introducing the crew."
gameofthrones,3dwu75,Aldebaran135,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:03:19 2015 UTC,I'd rather they not do it than jam it in.

gameofthrones,3dwu75,arrheniusopeth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:39 2015 UTC,Adding fAegon would be too much I think. It doesn't seem like he'll bring all that much to the endgame and constantly adding a lot more characters and storylines is bad for TV that is once a week episodes and only 10 of them.

gameofthrones,3dsfhg,conundric,2,Sun Jul 19 04:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's always been the plan to resurrect Jon in the same way as Beric and LSH. And I think the reason LSH was kept out of the show was because it gave us (especially casual viewers) that little bit of time to forget that people can be resurrected. If a major character came back no one would be surprised by the fact that another major character can come back. In the books there's enough time and enough information inbetween to give you that bit of doubt as soon as you read about Jon's death. In the show, there's not enough new information and it's so visual that it would be hard to forget.  Also, I don't think there's going to be anyone else resurrected other than Jon. If Myrcella survives (which I don't think she will) it will be because of an antidote, and if Stannis survives (which I don't think he will) it will be because Brienne didn't kill him to begin with. 2 of the 3 deaths were left kind of vague, and the one that was very clear is the one I think we will be seeing alive again. So if we see anyone else alive it won't be because of magic."

Dany and her dragons will play a major role in the story to come so she'll need to join the party with enough time left.  Davos, Mel, and newly-resurrected Jon Snow make big waves in the north, but honestly I have no clue where that dream team ends up.  I can see the Boltons being taken care of by the end of the next season just because they've had it coming for so long. ""The North Remembers"" and all that. Plus I feel like a shift will need to be made from political squabbles to the actual main conflict of Ice and Fire.

Jon, Mel, Davos regroup and lead the wildlings past the wall and allow them to settle and prepare for the impending threat. Jon somehow finds out R + L = J from Reed or Bran. Bran becomes a powerful warg from his time with the tree eyed raven and eventually crosses the wall to meet up with Rickon after the battle with the Boltons. Cleganebowl happens and Zombie Mountain is defeated, Cersei goes apeshit from that + fact that Myrcella is dead (Tommen also dies someho) and decides to burn the city to the ground with wildfire but Jaime makes the same choice he did with the Mad King and chokes her to death then kills himself out of misery effectively fulfilling Maggy's prophecy.

The Gallic tribe known as the Averni wielded spears and became the most powerful of the Gallic tribe, and they didn't need to be dick-less to do it! The level of training these Unsullied theoretically have received should earn them the right to a higher kill to death ratio EVEN OUT OF FORMATION. People say spears are bad for close quarters. That may be so, but they are great for corridors that you can easily form a wall in. It makes a mini ""hot gates"" setup at any time for patrols giving them plenty of opportunity for the unsullied to do their absolute best.

In context with that moment with Sansa in Season 1, it gives us the definitive source of his desire to punish those weaker than him, especially young girls.   Also, you think this is ""just a grudge""?  Meryn is one of Cersei's most trusted ""enforcers"" and seeing as Cersei and Joffrey's rise to power resulted in the death of Ned Stark and the fragmentation of the Stark family, yeah, it's just a simple grudge (sarcasm)...

gameofthrones,3dqs1b,Jeavo,4,Mon Jul 20 01:35:38 2015 UTC,I've been obsessed with the Game Of Thrones series since the start but have never bothered to pick the books up and read them properly until a couple of weeks ago.  As sad as it sounds seeing this just made reading the books feel so rewarding just for the fact of the little thing that I noticed in this picture that I wouldn't have otherwise noticed if I hadn't read the book. The scene is from the Catelyn Stark chapter where she takes Tyrion as prisoner to Lysa and I LOVE the fact that the artist has drawn the wooden harp on the back of Marillion the bard who volunteered to go with the party.
gameofthrones,3dqs1b,Jeavo,3,Sat Jul 18 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"Also check out the thin little waterfall in the back up top with the Eyrie. If you just read AGOT you might recall the small backstory on Alyssa's Tears. Here's the wiki summary of them to remind you:   Alyssa's Tears is a waterfall in the Vale of Arryn. It lies on the western side of the Giant's Lance. It receives its name from Alyssa Arryn, an ancient member of House Arryn who saw her family butchered before her and never shed a tear. No drop of the waterfall reaches the floor of the valley below.   http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alyssa%27s_Tears"

gameofthrones,3dsvcf,jymhtysy,7,Sun Jul 19 05:43:57 2015 UTC,I enjoyed reading that book almost as much as the show itself. Such an interesting world.
gameofthrones,3dsvcf,HadesHD,6,Sun Jul 19 06:16:11 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate?
gameofthrones,3dsvcf,ProCarbonz,20,Sun Jul 19 11:23:41 2015 UTC,"House Reyne was a house sworn to the Lannisters before they- and one other- rebelled against the Lannisters about four decades ago. Tywin Lannister, not yet a Lord, (his rather incompetent father still held the title), took the Lannister armies to hunt them down.  Tywin fought House Tarbeck in battle, (the 'other' house I mentioned), and exterminated them entirely, before going after the Reynes. After beating most of the Reynes in battle, the remaining members of the family hid in their personal mines, (underneath Castamere, their keep), hoping to stay out of Tywin's reach.  What did Tywin do? He sealed all the entrances to the mines and filled them with water, drowning everyone within. That exterminated the second of the two houses that rebelled, re-stated the Lannister's control over the Westerlands, and showed the world for the first time who Tywin fookin' Lannister was.  The song, 'The Rains of Castamere' was written to commemorate the rebellion. A lot of the lyrics can be interpreted as having double meanings.   ""A coat of gold or a coat of red, a lion still has claws."" - House Lannister has a golden lion for a sigil, House Reyne a red lion. This was the Reynes saying, 'you don't scare us', essentially. ""Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall, with not a soul to hear."" - This indicates that after the defiance of House Reyne, they got utterly crushed. The rains pour over Castamere, and no one is there to hear it, indicating that they were completely wiped from the face of the earth. 'The rains' could, and probably does, also indicate the fact that their mines were filled with water to kill them all.   If you're still confused, this song became famous across Westeros, reminding everyone of why they should fear Tywin Lannister. It was the song that was played at the Red Wedding, as the signal to begin the attack on Robb Stark and his men. 'You don't mess with the Lannisters', is the moral of the story."
gameofthrones,3dsvcf,MattSR30,3,Sun Jul 19 12:20:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe the ""Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall, with not a soul to hear."" is referring to the the mines being flooded, but the silence part could also be because of the sealed entrances. (I'm guessing you can't hear the drowning screams after you sealed the entrances and filled their lungs with water ?)"
gameofthrones,3dsvcf,BornTo1337,3,Sun Jul 19 12:37:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, nice one. See, I love the song for this. Only just re-covering the events of the Reyne's Rebellion did I realize that the 'rains' might be referring to the flooding. I always took it simply as just literal rain, passing over a hall with no one there to hear it.  Now, I can think of it in an entirely different way, and your contribution has only added to that. Such a great little song George came up with, reminds me a lot of Tolkien's incredible songs."
gameofthrones,3dsvcf,MattSR30,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:08:27 2015 UTC,Credits should also go to Ramin Djawadi who is the composer. Martin just wrote the lyrics afaik

gameofthrones,3dsvcf,MattSR30,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yea there's for sure a double, hell maybe triple entendre...I interpret the ""Rains"" part as not only a play on the House's name, but also the water sliding down the walls of the mine to flood it and kill them, and also perhaps on a more metaphysical level, the sadness of 300 men, women and children perishing in that horrible way. It all fits together masterfully."

This helps Boltons control the North, which was given to them by the Lannisters.  I'm actually not for the idea, honestly since she was a prostitute in the north, which makes it a lot harder to pass her off as a Stark (especially since she was a popular one for the customers at that)."

gameofthrones,3druz2,kingstoken,16,Sun Jul 19 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, we may be few, but we fly Melisandre's flair proudly in this sub.  Melisandre is one of the most fascinating characters in GoT. Her job is to understand highly-ambiguous prophecy, so it's understandable if she gets it wrong sometimes, even when doing so leads to tragic effects.  But despite those failings, she has and always has been focused on the things that matter - the big picture, the need for a leader to save Westeros from the White Walkers and the army of the dead. Almost no one else on Westeros gets that, not even the Night's Watch. She knows what actually matters, and she might not know who that leader is, but she knows that such a leader is needed."

I think her problem is the way she sees the world (in black and white) and the very brutal ways in which she works, but that only shows her dedication to her goal. And I hate how people always bitch about her killing Shireen as if she did it for fun. When Melisandre understood in episdoe 10 that she was wrong about Stannis, she was shaken not only because he is not Azor Ahai, but also because she killed a child for nothing and she knows it. She is not a heartless person.   The season ended with Mel being shattered and it seems like she lost her faith, but I believe she will find a way to restore her faith and she will figure out what needs to be done. Maybe 6 theory will also be her redemption for what happened in episode 9."

Davos, on the other hand, got most of this army killed on the Blackwater. Although he isn't the only one to blame, he was a part of this failure. He did made Stannis go to the Wall, which was a good idea. Mel and Davos has equal parts in Stannis' plot line, but I think that in the end when the white walkers will come Mel will be more important."

I'm sure that if I had been a slave and then suddenly wasn't a slave anymore, and some guy was telling me that it was because some god chose me to do something, I would be a fanatic too, you know? Stannis is nothing to her now that she realizes he wasn't the chosen one. She's still going to fight for her god, in the best way she knows how.

Once a skinchanger has slipped into the skin of an animal, they form a bond. Distance doesn't matter, it's not as if the signal gets weaker when they're further apart.

gameofthrones,3dr92d,---__-_--__----_-_--,73,Sat Jul 18 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"The Three Eyed Crow is Brynden Rivers aka Bloodraven.  Aegon Targaryen lives.  A massacre, not warfare, will defeat Robb Stark.  Valyrian steel can kill Others.  Illyrio is the man Varys is taking to at the Red Keep.  Lady Olenna was behind the Purple Wedding.  Some of these are more ""strongly hinted"" that the show confirmed. Mostly because the books have specific POVs and the show does not."
gameofthrones,3dr92d,Lord_NiteShade,7,Sat Jul 18 18:24:44 2015 UTC,"Well, Aegon is questionable at this point; signs point to him actually being a Blackfyre saboteur, disguised as an escaped targaryen, under the tutelage of Iliryio, and by extension, Varys.  Aegon is their main plan, whereas Daenareys and Viserys were their back up plan.  Food for thought."
gameofthrones,3dr92d,OshQosh,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:52:30 2015 UTC,Aegon is true until someone can prove he isn't. Everyone keeps looking at this from a reader's perspective. Knock that off.
gameofthrones,3dr92d,Lord_NiteShade,14,Sat Jul 18 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"for the folks like me who haven't read the books, could you explain each theory and how it turned out to be correct or something? I get the massacre one with Robb Stark and the red wedding and Lady Olenna being behind the purple wedding was Joffreys death. But some of the others I'd love a explanation if you don't mind?"
gameofthrones,3dr92d,GarethGore,46,Sat Jul 18 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"1: Bloodraven being the three eyed crow.  This straight up came outta nowhere. The only real evidence is in one of the Dunk and Egg books Brynden Rivers is described as having ""a thousand eyes and one"" as Master of Whispers. That is it. The people that guessed were the crazies of their day.  2: Aegon Lives.  People wondered if Rhaegars children truly died since book one. Whenever they asked him GRRM would say ""It is certain that Rhaenys was killed, stabbed to death by Amory Lorch."" Never a direct answer on Aegon.  Sure enough 5 books later he invades with the Golden Company at his back.  3: The Red Wedding  The War of the Five Kings, specifically the Lannisters vs Starks, is heavily based on the War of Roses between the Yorks and Lancasters. Grrm draws a lot of historic inspiration, and long talked about his love of the Black Wedding, a real world event similar to the Red Wedding that occurred between two warring (celtic?) clans.  4: Valyrian Steel killing Others  It was a fan theory back since the magical metal was introduced. The dragonglass = dragonsteel = valyrian steel debate didn't help either. Sure enough the show has Jon Snow slicing an Other into white mist with his sword Longclaw. When its repeatedly hinted regular steel is useless, and you add magic steel to your book, it doesnt take a rocket surgeon to guess whats gonna happen. Chekov's Metalurgy.  5: Illyrio in the Red Keep.  In the books the scene in the Red Keep dungeon is from Arya's point of view. She cant see well from her hiding spot behind the dragon skull, and worse she's never actually met Illyrio or Varys before, so her description lacks a flat out confirmation. It's heavily hinted it was those two, but the tv show confirmed it by giving up the actual scene with both characters.   6: Olenna and the Purple Wedding.   In the book its again, hinted at her involvement. But Sansa is so oblivious to everything during the Purple Wedding nothing she does can be used as hard details. Sansa as a POV is a character that frequently misremembers traumatic events, blurring reality with the fantasy she creates to cope. (Example: When the Hound rescues her from the rioters she remembers them kissing. This never actually happens, and Sandor has a very different and more logical remembering of events).  Anyways, Littlefinger is obviously a key player, given he had all the plans set up to whisk Sansa away when the shit hit the fan, but the other culprits are never confirmed. The show has Olenna giving Sansa the poisoned hairnet, and later the actual poisoned piece is missing after Olenna readjusts the hairnet for Sansa. That combined with her additional scenes puts all the pieces in place to indicate she was the other major conspirator."
gameofthrones,3dr92d,Lord_NiteShade,9,Sat Jul 18 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"Is Aegon confirmed to be alive? I thought it was still not 100% true as to whether it is truly Aegon or not. It seems a bit less likely IMO since the the show hasn't even bothered to bring him up. If it's truly Aegon, it seems like something they would have definitely implemented his character into the show. He just seems to be a pretender IMO."
gameofthrones,3dr92d,gandalfsmagicgaydick,14,Sat Jul 18 21:34:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Aegon genuinely believes himself, that he is Aegon. I daresay his entire life he has been told 'you are Aegon Targaryen, the Iron Throne is yours'. The question is whether Varys really did plot and save Aegon all those years ago, or if he plotted and had some random kid raised as Aegon all those years ago."

You really think his whole plan was just 'keep Viserys and Danaerys alive until one of them can take the throne'? That's a fine plan, with his contacts and everything but there were many moments before they got to Illyrio where they were almost caught; basically it was extremely risky. It's much more like Varys to do that, but have at least one major back-up plan; this is that.  Also, if Varys sin't backing Aegon then why did he kill Pycelle and Kevan? His whole motive for that is to damage the Lannister power bloc, and create disarray just before the invasion.  Also: Varys was the one who 'saved' Aegon in the first place.  Varys isn't backing any one person, he is backing the Targaryen family, he always has been. He doesn't care which Targaryen gets the throne, so long as it's a Targaryen."

In our world, evidence matters because we have DNA testing and all that, but they don't. You can say burden of proof is on him, but ok... where do you expect him to get evidence? All that matters in a world like GoT is the perceived belief; it is likely that no evidence can be provided to either side, so if everyone else believes something that's actually one of the best reasons to believe it.  The only time there's been evidence for something like this is with Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella; because they all looked like they had no relation to their father who was Baratheon for whom 'the seed is strong'.

gameofthrones,3dr92d,wcc7777777,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"Right. You have to PROVE he's guilty. You don't have to PROVE he's innocent. Therefore, if we're taking that logic into consideration ""Aegon"" has to PROVE he's a Targ. It's like using the argument, well God 100% exists b/c you can't prove he doesn't. No, that's not how it works. That's a backwards way of thinking."
gameofthrones,3dr92d,gandalfsmagicgaydick,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:25:16 2015 UTC,"No, you can't use that logic. He is innocent of lying, and they must prove he isn't a Targaryen. What logic are you using? Guilty of being a Targaryen? And why bring religion into it? But I will stand on that anyways: God is real to those who think he is, and to them, will be real until you prove otherwise. Real until proven not."
gameofthrones,3dr92d,wcc7777777,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:55:39 2015 UTC,"No, that's not how it fucking works. There's a singular truth over whether there is a God or no. Regardless of what you believe, there is a cold hard truth. You can point to ""evidence"" of his existence if you believe in him. But you can't use the argument, you can't prove that he doesn't exist. That isn't how the truth works.  Same logic goes into whether or not he's Aegon. You can't say, well disprove that I'm Aegon. Aegon has to prove he's Aegon.  It's the same with Jesus right? Just think about it for one second, regardless of your religion and think of it as a story. Jesus had to prove he was the son of God. He didn't say, ""well you can't prove I'm not."" He performed miracles to prove that he IS the son of God. He didn't just claim to be the son of God and then say, well prove that I'm not.  How are you not getting this?"

Aegon Targaryen was in the east being raised by Illyrio Mopatis to take the Iron Throne. He invades with the might of the Golden Company, the greatest mercenary force to ever exist at his back.   Fans speculated that Aegon might not be dead when the book repeatedly tells us how unrecognizable his smashed body is. Varys later tells his end of the story, where he replaces baby Aegon with a lowborn urchin during the sack of Kings Landing, knowing Gregor Clegane wouldn't do anything less than absolute brutality to the child's body."

Kill Alliser Thorne and the rest of the traitors? Take over and become the leader of Castle Black again as a Direwolf? Why would Jon be a Warg as well as Bran? Nothing in the show has ever pointed towards that, and if a huge theory about him is correct he's less related to Bran than he's said to be.  Jon isn't vengeful, if he does come back I feel like he isn't going to be involved with The Night's Watch anymore, I can see Melisandre bringing him back to life because the Lord of Light has a purpose for him and he travels with her and possibly Davos."

gameofthrones,3dt1k9,runmelos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"According to her she can only do so much with leeches, but if she's really supposed to wake an actual Dragon from Stone like she promised she needs a more valuable sacrifice, someone with kingsblood and preferably that of an innocent child.   “The Lord of Light cherishes the innocent. There is no sacrifice more precious. From his king’s blood and his untainted fire, a dragon shall be born.”   edit: okay, in the series she doesn't really try to revive dragons, but to be fair they had to cut a lot of stuff from the books and couldn't help but create a few plotholes along the way. A snowstorm probably wouldn't need a sacrifice equal to reviving a dragon but the general rule (acc. to Mel) is that a full sacrifice is stronger than just blood in itself. Shireen will still burn in the books but probably either for her greyscale or to revive Jon Snow, and far away from Stannis by the way   ""Well, I do not beg, nor will I flee again.  I am Robert's heir, the rightful king of Westeros.  My place is with my men.  Yours is in Braavos.  Go with the banker, and do as I have bid."" ""As you command,"" Ser Justin said. ""It may be that we shall lose this battle,"" the king said grimly.  ""In Braavos you may hear that I am dead.  It may even be true.  You shall find my sellswords nonetheless."" The knight hesitated.  ""Your Grace, if you are dead — "" "" — you will avenge my death, and seat my daughter on the Iron Throne.  Or die in the attempt."" Ser Justin put one hand on his sword hilt.

The wall one is awesome because it shows the great size and scale in one small drawing and the one with arya in the hall of faces mostly because arya is a badass.
gameofthrones,3drry7,iZacAsimov,2,Sat Jul 18 21:43:53 2015 UTC,i agree with you on the arya one. In the show I kept thinking there's something weird about the columns. not bad or anything just slightly off. But when I saw that picture on the page you linked of the heads literally all over the columns and almost being the column it really made more sense to me. Kinda like those skulls catacombs in I think Europe

Ok, just realized this actually helped the above theory haha but his tone implied that it's in fact NOT very likely.

Its virtually impossible to sharpen anything using human strength and you can actually damage the blades if you do it wrong.  The act of sharpening actually strips away material on both sides to bring out a new ""edge"" on the blade.  In the time of knights, a spinning wheel of stone would do this and takes expert skill that would likely only find with an armorer or a blacksmith.  Honing is the day to day way you use a flat surface to realign the edge back into shape. The edge is still good and there, but as you use it, it bends a bit, gets some curling or other microscopic damage that needs to be addressed to maintain the best tool with the edge you have.   Look in your kitchen and at the block that holds your kitchen knives...that long rounded thing you see chefs rub the knife on before using?  Thats for honing a knife edge.  The edge may last a long time on a knife, but if you dont hone it, it will become more difficult to use.  You arent actually ""sharpening"", you are aligning the cutting edge.  Edit to add an easy to read article on the topic: http://lifehacker.com/5822608/how-do-i-sharpen-a-kitchen-knife"
gameofthrones,3dmh8e,MyL1ttlePwnys,24,Fri Jul 17 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"I've actually always wondered about the distinction... when I use that ""long rounded thing"" it comes away with metallic dust on it.  I assumed this meant I was sharpening the blade since I'm stripping away metal.  Am I doing it wrong or is it just an inconsequential amount of metal being shed?"
gameofthrones,3dmh8e,keithjr,40,Fri Jul 17 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"Friction will always remove something, but it isnt enough to worry about.

As violent a world as Westeros is, it wasn't like they were fighting wars every month for a thousand years. Even if Eddard was lopping off deserters heads every month, he wouldn't be sharpening it constantly. Most of the rest of the swords hung around for years with no use at all."

You either shave off bits of the metal to regain an edge, or you soften the metal so it can be reshaped into a better edge (which, I believe, would still require some additional sharpening).   Honing is just ""realigning"" the edge. You can do it with a smooth stone or ceramic. Some soft metal blades even just used stiff leather.   Basically, you can easily tell he's honing it just by the motion. He's not removing metal or applying heat, so ... Honing."

Unless, GRRM is invoking some sort of undying God-steel lore that will be explained later. Otherwise, claiming Valyrian steel never ever loses its edge breaks physics laws."

As far as I know someone actually emailed GRRM about it and he said that what happened was a one time magical event, a miracle. That is how we know. It is known that Targaryens are more immune to heat, which is why she can handle the scolding hot bath. Viserys definitely wasn't totally immune to heat though, nor the Targaryen king who drank wildfire."

Coupled with the scalding bath, a few comments here and there, and Drogo's pyre, the first season sure makes it look a lot like she's immune."
gameofthrones,3dmh8e,PastorWhiskey,13,Fri Jul 17 17:57:37 2015 UTC,I like the idea of a miracle because it kind of helps further the fact that there is some sort of God/s out there making the world turn.
gameofthrones,3dmh8e,SanguisFluens,3,Fri Jul 17 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"Targaryens are resistant to heat. Dany is able to take a scalding hot bath and touch dragon's eggs on a brazer without getting burned. However, Targaryens are by no means immune to fire. Viserys was killed by molten gold, and I'm fairly certain there's at least one member of the family who got roasted by their own dragon. What happened to Dany when she walked into the pyre was magic caused by her love for Khal Drogo and the blood sacrifice she made to try and save him. It was a one-time event that had nothing to do in her Targaryen powers."

gameofthrones,3dmh8e,ZombieWalrus,2,Fri Jul 17 16:43:07 2015 UTC,"Most likely habit. One would naturally just do what felt right even if it was unnecessary. Think about it like a mechanic who goes through a checklist of things to check, even if they know what's wrong. Or a doctor who checks instinctively for other causes or injuries even if it might be clear what's wrong (think a broken arm or something). After doing it so long with other swords, it could just be habit."

House Stark is in no way allied with the Lannisters. The closest they got was the unconsummated Sansa-Tyrion wedding. Read before you speak.  Let's break down the Lannister allies.  1: Baratheon via marriage. Tommen and Mycella are the only ""Baratheons"" left. No secret hate.  2: Tyrell via marriage relations. The Tyrells dont have a secret hatred of the Lannisters. They are just rivals and using them to further their own power.  3: The sworn vassal houses of the Westerlands via feudal contract. None oppose the Lannisters currently, and the ones who bore hatred were destroyed by the hand of Tywin.  Now let's look at the people that hate them.  1: House Stark. Not allied, mostly in exile.  2: House Martell. Not allied, plotting secretly.   3: House Tully. Not allied, mostly in exile.  4: House Targaryen. Not allied, currently in exile.  There is no overlap between houses that hate them and houses that are allied with them."

And as we've seen with her actions with Jaime and Sansa, she takes her duty very seriously. The cutaway, at least as far as I understand, was explained by the show writers as simply a method to hide the gore out of respect for the character. That doesn't make a lot of sense. I think they did it to spin up the fan theory sites and to counterbalance the eventual resurrection of Jon Snow. It provides a lot of debate material and allows the show creators to act like they could have gone either way with those characters.  As far as sentencing him to die, that was kind of weird. She was a Kingsguard, not a liege lord. She can't sentence anybody, only avenge. So I don't know why that was put in."

We never see her die. And after Tyene leaned in on Bron he had a weird look on his face. Perhaps she slipped him the antidote. Perhaps the goal was never to kill Myrcella but simply to to try to start the war. Theon and Sansa, I just get a assassin's creed leap of faith type vibe where they land in a haycart Stannis. We obviously didn't see the killing blow so thats up for interpretation but also Brienne had a very interesting look on her face right after stannis said ""do your duty"" idk if that line has special meaning to Brienne in the books but perhaps it changed her mind at the last second. or perhaps a Bolton soldier showed up right at that moment and Stannis ends up saving her Jon Snow we all know the theory of how by now. Even though it's theory i still worry about even if it's still theory discussing it also ruins the surprise so yeah it's possible.   i think the only ones we can be sure are dead are Miranda and Meryn fookin Traunt and stannis wife"

Might be just me, but I think I might've heard some footsteps. Someone with headphones could confirm. Also there might be a chance, that Stannis's words: ""Do your duty."" went waaaay too deep for Brienne. She's sworn to fight for house of Baratheon (I can barely remember, could've been just sworn to Renly) and that's another reason for her to leave him alive. Though it's clearly not HBO style, leaving a character alive, despite the fact he has nothing more to do - his army probably got slaughtered, Melisandre abandoned him, Davos is also far from him, his daughter burned in a sacrifice, and his wife commited a suicide. No loose ends, pretty much. It would really add spice though, if they all united - Brienne, Pod, Mannis, Reek and Sansa, that would be hella sick.

gameofthrones,3drzke,ekbowler,3,Sun Jul 19 11:00:19 2015 UTC,I think that he has multiple ideas on how events can play out. He approaches Ned with this preferable idea and then when it doesn't play out he adapts like he has been doing for the whole series. That's what makes Littlefinger such a great player of the game he never puts himself in too much danger or too close to someone and always has another plan.

I expect it will play out pretty much the same way in the show, but the identity of his killer will be different.  Do you want an explanation of him as a character as well?  Or were you just looking for a prediction of what he'll do next season."
gameofthrones,3ds6j3,komacki,6,Sat Jul 18 23:36:11 2015 UTC,That was perfect. I really started to like him as a character in the show because he was the last voice of reason in Kings Landing and I figured he would have learned a thing or 2 from Tywin by now
gameofthrones,3ds6j3,komacki,4,Sun Jul 19 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"I figured he would have learned a thing or 2 from Tywin by now   Yeah, the books go into the relationships between Tywin and his siblings more, but Kevan is basically a less-talented version of Tywin (only because Tywin is REALLY talented) who accepted Tywin's leadership as the first son and heir and fell in line behind him early on, which isn't really true of their other brothers.  He also lacks some of the bad qualities that Tywin has."

gameofthrones,3drkc6,Lost_And_NotFound,6,Sat Jul 18 19:45:44 2015 UTC,"1: Dragons have 6 appendages, wyverns have 4. The show dragons are actually wyverns that happen to breath fire.  Note that there are actual venom spitting wyverns that live on Sorothyos. The world book hints dragons may not be an organic species, and the original ones may have been some kind of alchemic chimera spliced between a wyvern and the fire wyrms that burrowed beneath Old Valyria.  2: Many things, none confirmed. Nowhere does it state dragons are immortal. They are just long lived. Old age killed Balerion at 224~. The Dance of Dragons killed many of the Targaryen dragons, including 5 in the dragonpit that were killed by a massive peasant uprising. The stunted growth could be caused by several different theories. It could be from the decline of magic in the world, Targaryens losing some of the knowledge of how to raise dragons, a side effect of the destruction of old valyria, or meddling by outside forces like the Maesters or Faceless Men poisoning the dragons over generations.  3: ""Dragon's eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,"" said Magister Illyrio. ""The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty."" There were, and likely still are, wild dragons that lived in Asshai by the Shadow. Illyrio purchased his eggs from there. Dragon eggs are not uncommon, many extremely wealthy people have that as expensive jewels. Its just the fact Daenerys hatched the first ones in a century that changed everything. There are likely no eggs at the Red Keep. Aegon V moved the eggs to Summerhall, which was later destroyed. There are rumors there are egg clutches still on Dragonstone."
gameofthrones,3drkc6,Lord_NiteShade,3,Sat Jul 18 19:55:00 2015 UTC,Of course I'd forgotten about the Dance Of Dragons which solves that question largely! As for there being many more eggs around is it not therefore possible that Daenerys could hatch yet more dragons?
gameofthrones,3drkc6,Lord_NiteShade,6,Sat Jul 18 20:09:00 2015 UTC,"If she's willing to burn more people to death then yes.  Dany hatching dragons isnt special because she's a targaryen. It's special because of fire and blood. She burned Mirra Mazz Durr, Drogo, and Rhaego on a funeral pyre, and this death paid for the life of the dragons. None of the book characters have caught on to this yet.  The eggs were useless until dany came around, but not because dany came around."
gameofthrones,3drkc6,Lord_NiteShade,2,Sat Jul 18 20:13:37 2015 UTC,Oh so they just don't realise that it was the deaths that caused the hatching? Is it not more obvious given that it's her House motto?
gameofthrones,3drkc6,GumdropGoober,2,Sat Jul 18 20:22:32 2015 UTC,"Is it not more obvious    No one is going around burning people to death on top of a pile of eggs to see if they hatch. People just assumed long ""dead"" eggs turn to stone, which they effectively do."

The most likely answer is that dragons react poorly to domestication, especially given their size compared to the dragonpit.  They just lacked the room to grow to the sizes the first generation did.  The only dragon I can remember who was raised/lived without human domestication at work past Aegon's time was the Cannibal, and it supposedly was huge."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,mrmagoo512,58,Sat Jul 18 05:51:55 2015 UTC,Smarter? Who knows.  They're playing different games  Varys is playing a part in a plan that has multiple players.  LF is playing a solo game.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,joftheinternet,23,Sat Jul 18 05:56:02 2015 UTC,LF solo mid
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Debeli1337,-17,Sat Jul 18 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"Top is arguably the soloyist of lanes, although you could he's the jungler, doing his thing and popping out at opportune times to cause chaos."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,TracyMorganFreeman,94,Sat Jul 18 18:03:17 2015 UTC,"LF's obsession with Catelyn will be his undoing. I don't know if that makes him less ""smart"", per se, but it is a clear weakness, and I don't think Varys has an equivalent one."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,DabuSurvivor,50,Sat Jul 18 06:05:21 2015 UTC,I think Varys is more tied down to doing what is right than LF.   As for the Catelyn he was content to abandon Sansa to a sadist like Ramsay so I think he's not so tied down to honouring her memory. He serves his own ends primarily.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,themightypierre,15,Sat Jul 18 08:49:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think Varys is tied down to doing what's right at all, really. I think he just puts up that facade. But then that's factoring in book stuff more than show stuff I guess - which is kosher for a thread with this spoiler scope but might not be what you're going off of so much.  I know D&D's explanation of having LF send Sansa to Winterfell was that he just didn't know about how awful Ramsay is, not that he didn't care."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,DabuSurvivor,2,Sat Jul 18 09:00:11 2015 UTC,"One thing about Varys that always gets me are Cersei's and Pycel's reactions to him in Season 2, and what they tell Tyrion about him. Now, we can guess that they were just trying to poison Tyrion against Varys, but at the same time, I can't help but wonder if Cersei really was trying to warn Tyrion, especially given Varys's glee at having his revenge against the sorcerer."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Rosebunse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:13:58 2015 UTC,I think it is possible that Varys is for the realm since Aegon might be in his opinion better for stability than Kevan. As he said Aegon will put his people first. Also if Dany joins Aegon  (not sure if part of his plan but makes sense if the show is going the same way) then a war with Dragons would be pretty quick.  That being said Varys motives are obviously suspect.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,mandrilltiger,3,Sat Jul 18 13:16:36 2015 UTC,I haven't read the books but I thought Daenerys was the last living Targaryen?
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,TheWhiteGaryColeman,9,Sat Jul 18 13:34:53 2015 UTC,It's difference between the book and the show.  This video explains the difference and is mostly show spoiler safe because it probably won't be in the show. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y8S9skQzoo  tl;dw  Unrelated by if you only watch the show why do you have Euron Greyjoy flair.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,mandrilltiger,4,Sat Jul 18 13:57:49 2015 UTC,haven't read the books  Euron Greyjoy flair   I am confused by this as well
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,sivret20,3,Sat Jul 18 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"Haha yes that can seem confusing, I read that Mads Mikkelsen had been considered as Euron for the next season. Since I am danish like Mads, I started reading about the character and just thought he sounded like a cool character, and I could easily see Mads in that role. That's really all there is to it :)"

gameofthrones,3dpmuw,samarthur8,3,Sat Jul 18 13:35:16 2015 UTC,Maybe that is a lie. He could be saying that so people think that that is what he wants and is after - it is often said that LF's affection/love for her is well known. He could be simply letting this run so people think that is part of his motivation when in fact he doesn't care. Sansa perhaps thinks she could use this against him but in the end it wouldn't be what he is after.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Stoic_Statesman,3,Sat Jul 18 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think the writing is on the wall. GRRM has compared Littlefinger to Gatsby, the show had an incredibly subtle moment of Tyrion saying ""Sansa's not a murderer... not yet anyway"" before we cut to her and LF, LF talks to her about seeking revenge on ""those who hurt the ones we love"", and in ASOS the ""ghost"" of High Heart foresees Sansa ""slaying a savage giant in a castle made of snow"", and House Baelish's ancestral sigil is a giant."

I don't think its likely though, it would have been possible if BWBs had been mentioned in the meantime, they could have dropped hints in about some force of nature attacking Lanisters, or one of the other travellers could have found bodies fucked up and left in strange ways and so on. I don't think it would work now just adding her in though"

She's on the other tribe at the other side of the world, playing the same game, seemingly with the stronger team behind her but when they finally merge in Westeros will Littlefinger knock her and her allies out only to make a clear path for Sansa to win the end of the game?  Sansa, obviously, being Natalie White - seemingly weak and useless for much of the game only to come into her own in the later seasons and making connections with almost all the players that will serve in her favour allowing her to win by the end of the game?"

gameofthrones,3dpmuw,captainfluffballs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Well, she does have a lot of reason to execute Varys - as far as she knows he was coordinating Robert's attempts to have her killed with only Tyrion's words in his favor. But Varys had no way of knowing that she was going to be absent from Mereen. Tyrion's presence there wasn't prominent knowledge until after the fighting pits, methinks, so it makes sense for him to show up (or at least, make his presence known) following that."

gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Perspective1310,13,Sat Jul 18 05:59:06 2015 UTC,"People have been saying Littlefinger based on the fact that his plans always seem to succeed, while Varys has had failures and blind spots.  They miss the fact that Varys' path is the far more difficult one.  What is Littlefinger trying to do? He is grabbing power for himself by any means necessary. What is Varys trying to do? He is trying to manipulate all of the players in the game in a way that will bring about a lasting peace. People say that Littlefinger is Varys with ambition, but to me, Littlefinger's ambitious are a far more common and simple matter than Varys'.   Varys is just on a whole 'nother level."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,DatClubbaLang96,0,Sat Jul 18 12:25:08 2015 UTC,You are just saying that doing the noble thing is smart... not necessarily.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,_m0s_,4,Sat Jul 18 12:20:49 2015 UTC,"That's not really what I was saying.   LittleFinger has one goal - to put himself at the top. That involves creating chaos that moves higher players out of the way, so that he can climb that ladder, and move his piece to the top.  Varys has the incredible complex task of arranging all of the pieces in a way that will result in a lasting piece. One of the biggest difference between him and Littlefinger is that Varys doesn't fancy himself as one of those pieces. Rather, he takes the gamemaster's role, attempting to manipulate every piece on the board.  Cutting a path for yourself is much simpler than arranging the board to create peace."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,DatClubbaLang96,36,Sat Jul 18 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"Littlefinger. Varys claims he is the most dangerous man in Westeros and literally the only person who he can't figure out. Littlefinger has a all-win scenario going for him now (as far as he can tell) while Varys has all his eggs in one basket. While Varys may reign supreme in their conflict, Littlefinger is smarter. And think: Littlefinger wants chaos and Varys wants stability. If you've watched the show up to this point then you should know there has been more chaos than stability. All of Littlefingers plans have succeeded, while Varys has been thwarted on several occasions"
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,ejelder21,22,Sat Jul 18 21:45:07 2015 UTC,"there has been more chaos than stability.   It's not that simple though. Chaos is significantly easier to stir up compared to keeping peace. It's like that in fictional worlds and it's like that in the real world. When has any world ever seen ""peace"" the way we imagine it.  If you evaluate Varys plans, they have been pretty successful because he puts his eggs on the Targaryeans and on that front he has been doing pretty well. Yeah in the show they skipped the whole book 5 epilogue but it's clear that Varys is pretty competent in carrying out his plans."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,YoYoSun,10,Sat Jul 18 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"All of Littlefingers plans have succeeded,   You don't even know his plans though. GRRM doesn't give us his POV. He's one of the characters whose true intentions are not presented to the viewers.  If anything we could only speculate. It seems to me he rarely has a rigid plan and plays a very adaptable and flexible game, so wildly different outcomes will still work to his favor; chaos is his ladder.  However, his game is not without its downfalls. He started and fueled the Stark and Lannister war and it cost him Catelyn. I think he would have done anything he could to prevent that if he had seen it coming. He's definitely capable of some really stupid mistakes as clever as he is."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,chuhrros,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:39:40 2015 UTC,"I think he's been very successful so far. I also think that's because he's done a good job of flying under the radar until now. A lot of his success has been due to people not even considering him a threat. The obvious problem with this is, now that he's starting making huge, sudden gains, his invisibility has worn off. It remains to be seen what he can get away with now that people have actually got their eyes on him."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,dongazine_supplies,0,Sat Jul 18 12:23:36 2015 UTC,"Cat's death was a pretty huge loss for him, and no he's without Sansa, a key part of his plans."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Rosebunse,15,Sun Jul 19 02:41:41 2015 UTC,"I think this question is the entire answer to Who will win The Game Of Thrones.  Every other character is a mis-direct and entire Game is being played between Varys and Littlefinger.  Dany staying with Illyo, getting involved with Drogo, becoming Khalisi, the dragon eggs, Bariston, Jorah Mormont and now Tyrion - all a result of Varys helping to position Danaerys to take the throne with him by her side.  Little finger's plans have changed but everything he did and is doing was to get rid of the barathions/lanisters and position The Starks to take the Iron Throne - I'm guessing he initially was aiming for Robb but now positioning Sansa.  I think thats his end game at least at the moment.  TD:DR - Who is smarter, Varys or Littlefinger is the same question as Who Will Win The Game Of Thrones?"
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,cgbrannigan,5,Sat Jul 18 15:10:15 2015 UTC,Isn't also the point of the azor ahai prophecy and the white walkers that it doesn't even matter who wins the game of thrones ?
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Drakkeur,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:38:53 2015 UTC,"I dont know that prophecy coz I'm not a book reader and it hasn't been mentioned in the TV show so I like to ignore all the proficies until they are show canon, including R+L=J and this whole Jon being a warg thing.  It's not been set up in the show, there's not been any Wargs in the show since like Season 3 - putting that in the show now would completely alienate the 99% of the viewers who dont read the books or talk about it online.  As for the Walkers - they throw a wrinkle into every bloody theory I have as to how this show is going to end.  I like the politics and war, the walkers, bran, all the shit north of the wall, just interferes with the good story going on in the North, Kings Landing and Essos."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,cgbrannigan,4,Sat Jul 18 21:51:54 2015 UTC,Azor Ahai is show canon....  Remember Stannis and the burning sword gag from season 2?  The connection between the Starks and the direwolves has been around since literally the pilot episode and is a big deal.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,OmNomSandvich,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:46:13 2015 UTC,"I dont remember that one no, will look out for it when I rewatch.  Starks and Direwolves having a connection, yes.  No one ever said they could warg into them other than Bran - and if the R+L=J thing is true then he's not even a stark anyway!   And the R+L=j thing has never been mentioned on the show, the fact that in 5 seasons of the show there have been, maybe, two conversations each about R&L and no hint at a connection to J makes me completely ignore any of that theory until something more concrete happens.  Maybe it was the intention back when Ned first told Jon he'd tell him about his mother next time he see's him (in heaven) but I dont think they have any intention of that happening in the TV show now.  It's been too long and, if we're still on a 7 season run as D&D have said, then there are 20 episodes left to set up a LOT of history for it to make sense to the 99.5% of people who watch this show and dont read the books."

Varys's long game is much better than Littlefinger's, from what we've seen so far.   I don't think Tyrion is wrong to trust Varys as much as he does. I think Varys has shown how willing he is to lie and be deceptive and informed, but he does this while saving people he deems either good or innocent. He would have saved Ned in a heartbeat with the deal that was supposed to send him to the wall.   I don't really think you can compare the two. Littlefinger is more like Cersei or Tywin and Varys is more like Tyrion, or Lady Olenna."

LF is so good because he has his path to the top planned out 50 times over and makes no commitments to anyone else, whereas Varys has a hand in everything and everyone. Ultimately they are playing different games though, Varys wants to change the society they live in and LF wants to rule any society even if it means being 'lord of the ashes'. They will have to clash properly at some point of course."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,19peter96r,6,Sat Jul 18 15:37:51 2015 UTC,"Littlefinger is arrogant and foolish. He doesn't want to just outwit everybody and win the Game of Thrones, he wants everybody to know he's untrustworthy, outwitting them, and out to win. He isn't seen as a threat and this kills him, his best advantage is also a humiliating weakness. Varys is far more subtle, he wants to be seen as either a non-threat or a benevolent ally. Littlefinger still needs to stick it to all the people who bullied him as a kid - he is a known quality and a rather petty desperately egotistical one.  Varys is so good at deception that even the readers don't know his motives yet."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,BlueHighwindz,2,Sat Jul 18 11:22:42 2015 UTC,"This is especially true for the show. Seriously, Varys has a lot of viewers fooled. Granted, he's portrayed much more benevolently, but at the same time, we're given hints and warnings throughout the show that Tyrion is a bit of a fool to trust him too much."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Rosebunse,6,Sat Jul 18 12:23:07 2015 UTC,"I think Varys is the better of the two, especially when you figure that, while Littlefinger certainly came from very humblr beginnings, Varys actually started life as a slave, was horrifically tortured, and then managed to pull himself out of poverty and get himself a royal position in a foreign country.   And that's why he scares me."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Rosebunse,6,Sat Jul 18 15:00:07 2015 UTC,Littlefinger is the parasite kind of smart. Smart at undermining others to promote himself. As clever as he is he brings no good to the team overall.   Varys has value independent from others and can basically survive without leeching on some higher ones and eventually build up the team.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,ryanmok17,5,Sat Jul 18 14:58:58 2015 UTC,There is something to be said about the fact that Varys actually manages to have friends and Littlefinger doesn't.

gameofthrones,3dpmuw,dongazine_supplies,3,Sat Jul 18 09:39:58 2015 UTC,Baelish is a better tactitian. He could be in tight situation and weasel his way to victory with one move.

Their brief forays always end with Baelish a step ahead, be it his knowledge of Varys's association with Illyrio, the false smuggling of Sansa, or the failed protection of Ros.  Currently, Baelish has climbed his chaotic ladder to a remarkable position, and is already poising himself to reap further rewards in the North. Meanwhile, Varys is on the other side of the world, diminished in power, albeit with the potential for greater things (assuming Jorah doesn't stab him the second he sees him). That said, Baelish has allowed himself maneuverability between houses and allies, whereas Varys is on his last resort. Should Daenerys fail (or even simply rebuke his offer of assistance), he is lost.  I love Varys, he's easily one of my favorite characters overall, but he fails. Worse yet, he misjudges. His poor understanding of those he tries to guide and game have been his biggest folly. Aerys, Joffrey, Viserys, Jorah, Olenna, Littlefinger himself; all examples of chess pieces making illegal moves, whereas Baelish utilizes his pawns far better, bending great houses to his whims."
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,PureLionHeart,2,Sat Jul 18 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"While I do think he definitely failed with Aerys and Joffrey, he didn't fail with Viserys, Jorah, Olenna, or Littlefinger, at least, not exactly. For one thing, I think he knew through his Little Birds that Viserys was more or less useless as a pawn, and Jorah was probably never supposed to let Dany be killed. Plus, Varys was the one who told Selmy about Jorah in the first place. As for Olenna, Cersei is a wildcard, and Varys would probably have been demoted or tossed out anyways since she really didn't like him.   He's in Mereen, where he has more control and an a key ally in Tyrion. If they get Mereen in tip-top shape by the time Dany returns, then he'll probably win her trust and Jorah won't be able to do a damn thing. Plus, no one can say he wasn't loyal to her family. If he were to tell her a bit about himself, like his time as a slave, then she'd probably be more than happy to have him on her team."

gameofthrones,3dpmuw,ShakespearesBrother,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:09:06 2015 UTC,I would say LF. He does things himself and always knows what is going to happen. Varys just has a bunch of spies so he knows things.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,Pattyfactor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:39:16 2015 UTC,One advantage that Varys has is that there is an ongoing impression that he is working as a part of a network and has friends and allies. Baelish also makes alliances here and there but he is an isolated mastermind kind of an actor.
gameofthrones,3dpmuw,_m0s_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:20:55 2015 UTC,I think Baelish is a good strategist but Varys has a higher EQ. Varys is more balanced and empathetic. Littlefinger seems pure sociopath.

gameofthrones,3dpmuw,get_out_my_swampert,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:55:21 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you define ""smarter"". If you mean smarter as in a shrewd and sharp person in dealings with other people I would lean towards Littlefinger because he is a master manipulator who has orchestrated a series of lucrative possibilities while simultaneously running business ventures in Kings Landing.  If you mean smarter as an intellectual thinker with ready mental capabilities then I would say Varys because of his versatility and problem solving skills on a national scale. He has a myriad of contacts, is a master thief, has the right friends in the right places, is quick witted, knows when to bail, and has his ideals in order with his goals. He is a more rounded intellectual than Littlefinger, yet there is some contention between which is a better manipulator in their own fields.  This is a problem question because there is no precise scale for what is smart, therefore without establishing what you mean this thread is irrelevant."

Baelish on the other hand now wields considerably more influence in King's Landing and over the Vale of Arryn, the Riverlands, and potentially the North, as well as a strong relationship with the Reach through Olenna Redwyne.

I don't think Baelish will survive long enough for Daenerys to land on the shores of Westeros though. But that's a separate matter entirely.  As far as the rivalry between Baelish and Varys goes, Baelish is winning, or has already won. The only way Varys can make a comeback now is if Daenerys takes the Iron Throne, which she must win by conquest - an endeavour that will take some considerable time and doing. Until that time, there is very little Varys can do to Baelish."

gameofthrones,3dp7wd,Sciex,100,Sat Jul 18 03:13:09 2015 UTC,"Sandor is one of the most interesting and deep characters in the whole story.  As a child he loved knights and wanted to become one of them.  He was idealistic and believed in heroic stories where  true knights fought evil villains and saved the helpless.  His naivety was crushed by his brother Gregor.  Gregor caught his younger brother playing with one of Gregor's wooden knights, and in a selfish rage Gregor grabbed Sandor and pressed his face against a hot brazier, which nearly killed Sandor and resulted in the severe scars on one side of his head.  Gregor is also suspected of killing their younger sister and father, the latter which gave Gregor control of the Clegane lands and titles.    Gregor was knighted a few years after maiming Sandor.  From Sandor's point of view, he's seen evil get knighted and kill the innocent without punishment.   His brother's deeds, and likely the actions of Gregor's friends/followers, have shown Sandor that the title of knight does not make anyone noble in their heart.  His experience is that there are no true knights, that the strong will always hurt the weak, and the weak can either hide or die.  That's why he joined the Lannisters and became Joffrey's ""dog.""  Sandor did it to escape Gregor.  While in the Lannisters' service, Gregor couldn't kill him.  Gregor is one of the Lannister bannermen and serves them too.  Sandor learned to survive by obeying his Lords and keeping his mouth shut.  He no longer wants to become a knight or have honors because his view of them has been tainted.  And that brings him to the start of the story, where in Kings Landing he encounters Sansa Stark.  She's just as naive and innocent as he once was.  She believes in the same heroes and true knights.  All Sandor sees is a girl blindly standing in the middle of a road who's about to get trampled by the dark reality all around her.  He's reminded of who he once was, and he felt a need to save her, to help her learn how to hide to survive.  He may have even felt some need to help her in connection to his little sister who he was unable to save.  Ultimately it's all the cause of the subtle ways he protected Sansa while in Kings Landing.  Like on the bridge when she was thinking to push Joffrey, and Sandor stopped her.  He was not worried about Joff; he was warning her to not act out.  He's always the first to step forward and help Sansa, to cover her with a cloak, to escort her where she needs to go.  He's the only person who went looking for her during the Riot of King's Landing.  She awakens a sense of personal respect in Sandor that he'd pushed down and forgotten.  For her, he was the hero.  Which is why he finally leaves the Lannisters in disgust after the Battle of the Blackwater.  He doesn't want to blindly die in the service of people he doesn't respect.  The fire was his wake up call that if he continued on he'd not just be a tool but a dead tool.  He still tries to save Sansa, to take her away from all the backstabbing politics.  There is a hint of romance there, but SanSan shippers aside, I think it's more that he cares for the ideal that Sansa represents.  If she stays she'll likely either die or turn into someone like Cersei.  Sansa is the only good person Sandor knows, and he doesn't want to lose that.    He then travels the Riverlands and encounters the BWB with Arya.  He takes Arya with the intent to ransom her, but the money is not his main goal.  He's suddenly playing hero again and trying to get Arya to safety with one of her relatives.  He could have gotten easy ransom from other sources, and it's questionable whether anyone in Arya's family would have been any kinder to him than the Lannisters if he'd taken Arya back to Kings Landing.  He chooses to take her to family because he's following his own heart and not a Lord's orders.    He does not fight Brienne in the books, but he's injured in another fight with similar results.  His wounds become infected, and he's not able to continue.  Arya leaves him the same way, refusing to give him a quick death, and that's the last time the Hound is seen.  So what all that means is that Sandor is a tragic character scarred physically and emotionally who in the course of the story had begun a path to redemption, which was seemingly cut short.  Regardless of his apparent death, Sandor did have an impact on both Sansa and Arya that should influence their characters in the coming story.  Theory about what it all means, with book spoilers and most likely Season 6 spoilers  VERY HEAVY end story speculation  Edit for typo fix."

gameofthrones,3dp7wd,GotACoolName,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:57:03 2015 UTC,"One of the new characters is described this way in the casting call:   Priest, in his 40’s or 50’s. A gruff ex-soldier who found religion. Now a no-nonsense rural priest who ministers to the poor of the countryside. He’s salt-of-the-earth man who has weathered many battles.   It sounds like the Septon Meribald character.  In AFFC Meribald    I assume with all the changes for the show it'll mean Sam and Gilly will probably meet him instead."

Also, the northerners don't knight people and I think that not being a knight but still being in Sansa's service would appeal to him more, although after his brother really dies cleganebowlgethype his view of knighthood may be washed clean.  I wouldn't be upset if Ser Loras steps in and helps somehow, just to close that circle."
gameofthrones,3dp7wd,jtotheofo,10,Sat Jul 18 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Sandor is still very much the burned child. In the modern world, he would be probably diagnosed with PTSD and some kind of dissociative disorder. He has zero self esteem, and feels he is unworthy of love and only good for one thing; killing.   I haven't read the books so this is complete speculation in my part, but I feel that when he came in contact with the Starks, it may have been the first time he had been around truly decent people. A family who really cared about each other. So that even as he went about his duty of chasing down the butchers boy, etc, he started to fantasize about what it might be like to be like them.   When he showed up at Sansa's room at the Blackwater he was just so lost. His speech to her about her sons being killers was just as much about his own hopelessness as about reminding her of hers.   When he found Arya, he had every intention of returning her to Catelyn, and possibly had a future in the back of his mind that he might find a place in their house, their family..."

gameofthrones,3dse5e,Hyperdrunk,9,Sun Jul 19 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"""Fire cannot kill a dragon."" One of the most misunderstood lines in the series. :)"
gameofthrones,3dse5e,SnowWight,8,Sun Jul 19 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"And it sucks because it's not at all the fault of the viewers. They show Dany being fine in steaming water she's told is too hot, touching scalding hot eggs and not being burned like her handmaiden is, and then Viserys, a human who refers to himself as a dragon, dies from hot molten gold, only for her to say ""fire cannot kill a dragon"". A couple episodes later, she walks into a fire and comes out fine. What else are viewers supposed to take from that? When I watched season 1 with no knowledge of the series, I thought fire couldn't touch her."
gameofthrones,3dse5e,gemitry,7,Sun Jul 19 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. I actually wonder if D&D themselves thought she was immune to fire at that point. They haven't made any mention of it since then, so maybe they found out the truth and are quietly avoiding the subject like it never happened."
gameofthrones,3dse5e,SnowWight,2,Sun Jul 19 00:52:19 2015 UTC,I'm confused- how is it misunderstood? Doesn't it just mean she's immune to fire and other hot stuff?
gameofthrones,3dse5e,mr_pippins,2,Sun Jul 19 09:04:22 2015 UTC,"No. Viserys was always referring to himself as a dragon. When he would get angry and beat her, he would tell her it was her fault for ""waking the dragon."" So when he died from being burned, she basically said, ""you were no dragon, just a human.""  Daenerys has a higher tolerance for heat, which is why she likes hot baths. But no Targaryen is immune to fire. She survived Drogo's funeral pyre due to what GRRM called a one-time miracle, probably the blood magic being used during that scene. He doesn't seem to want to explain it in too much depth, so it could be he's waiting to bring it up again in the books.   No one would blame you for misunderstanding though, because as we said above, the show did a bad job of explaining this."

In the show Mira Maz Dur straight up kills Drogo as a revenge for him... well murdering everyone she knew and raping all her followers. Its coldblooded revenge, and that's why Daenerys burns her.  And so the great Khal Drogo dies not, as many other great warriors before him, not from the many battles he had fought in, but from an infection. Which was surprisingly common back in the day."

The women more or less let him die under the pretense that she was healing him as payback for what the Dothraki did to her village. It wasn't incompetence, what she did was deliberate.

Well at least the dragons were born   The girl that ""healed"" Drogo (I can not remember her name for the life of me) did it on purpose as revenge against them. I think (and don't hold me to this) it was because they raped them including her. So, she instead of healing him, she made it worse. And then after Daenerys asked her to save his life, she took the life of Daenerys' child to pay for the life of Drogo. And instead of Drogo going back to normal, he is left in a vegetative state."

gameofthrones,3dmqwx,Chinoiserie91,8,Fri Jul 17 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"It is very obvious exposition, ""sexpotition"" is what scenes like this are called in Game of Thrones. A couple of naked girls in the background so the viewers can survive the boring dialogue or so somebody at HBO seems to have thought. People only could watch fantasy because of nudity and violence and not storytelling etc. or that what many feel HBO though. This is the most infamous sexposition scene since it is so over the top and kind of ridiculous ""play with her arse""! after explaining of his motives and such. But these kind of over the top sexposition scenes really do not happen anymore in the show, the nudity goes better with the story nowadays. And book readers hate how Littlefinger would never vocalize his thoughts like that to anyone like he does in this scene so they are really vocal with hating this scene and how his character is handled overall.   And I would like to say that as a woman the scene does noting for me, and there are no similar scenes for women in this show either. I rather watch sexy scenes with real characters rather than women in the background as sex objects. Watching this scene was kind of awkward with my 15 year old brother as well... the show is PG 15 in my country btw."

They have heavily cut the sex out of the show after season 1.

If he is, though, I don't think that Melisandre could use his blood. So far as I can tell, it's not just the blood but the life that makes the spells work. Shireen had to burn, for instance, and Gendry's blood had to be in leeches for Melisandre's spell to work."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,teferi66,37,Sat Jul 18 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"Probably to make sure all those wildlings are still being mindless savages at war with eachother and not banding together towards some higher purpose.. like say, oh, uniting all of their tribes into a gigantic barbarian army bent on attacking the wall and crossing into the seven kingdoms."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,bigfatmelvin,2,Sat Jul 18 02:27:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, but if you just manned the wall and defended it from the wildlings climbing it then they really can't do any damage"
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,therapy,26,Sat Jul 18 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"Scouting tells you where and when attacks will occur, so you know how best to defend the Wall."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,SanguisFluens,2,Sat Jul 18 04:19:52 2015 UTC,I just don't think any wildlings would have any real shot of getting over assuming you focused on wall defense and shot arrows at them as they climed.
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,Mad_Luddite,11,Sat Jul 18 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"The Wall is 700 miles long. At the beginning of the show, the Night's Watch has somewhere in the range of 500-1000 men, including stewards and squires and the other people needing to keep everyone alive. If the Watch just patrolled the Wall, that would leave one man guarding a mile of Wall (a generous estimate, not accounting for the fact that there are only three manned castles and the sentries will need to be fed). While it's pretty damn hard to attack the Wall, it's not impossible. If thousands of Wildlings focused on one spot at once, there's a limited amount of arrows that the dozen or so men on that section of the Wall can carry or shoot, and eventually the Wildlings would break through."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,SanguisFluens,7,Sat Jul 18 05:27:20 2015 UTC,It makes you wonder why Mance didn't just send four groups of 100 Wildlings at very different areas.  There would be huge unmanned areas where no Crow would find them or defend against them.
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,Dat_Nigga_Dbizzle,4,Sat Jul 18 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"I was wondering that too. When he talks with Jon in his tent, he says that he sent 400 men to climb the Wall a few miles away. Why couldn't he have done that all along? Castle Black doesn't have any defenses from the south. A group bigger than the one led by Tormund could have easily taken the castle without needing to waste lives on the direct attack from the north."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,SanguisFluens,3,Sat Jul 18 06:32:38 2015 UTC,"Because as he tells Jon, his intention wasn't to destroy the watch but to get through, to the other side of the wall."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,iKnowJajko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:04:08 2015 UTC,Which he could have easily done by taking Castle Black from the south and opening the gate for his people to walk through.
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,SanguisFluens,3,Sat Jul 18 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"Because it's much easier and safer to get people through the gate than to climb the wall. I think he just wanted to get the Night's Watch to surrender, while only risking as many of his own that he had to. That's just a theory though."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,Mouthhands,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:22:55 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's a good point, but it would probably take a really long time to climb the wall, and if they focused on wall defense instead of ranging they would have more men to shoot them or get help from the closest castle"
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,Doylio,2,Sat Jul 18 12:47:17 2015 UTC,"It probably took the group Jon was with somewhere in the range of 8 hours to climb it (they started in the morning and finished as the sun was starting to set). That's enough time to get a dozen of the nearest sentries, at best. The three manned castles are Castle Black in the center, and Eastwatch and the Shadow Tower at either end, meaning that there are plenty of places a hundred miles or more from the nearest castle. Also, the more men they keep on call at the castles, the less sentries they have on top of the Wall."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,Torpid-O,4,Sat Jul 18 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"The wildlings can also enter the seven kingdoms thru the frostfang mountains, circumventing the wall"
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,Doylio,2,Sat Jul 18 03:52:41 2015 UTC,The Frostfangs don't bypass the wall do they?
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,katkriss,4,Sat Jul 18 10:47:35 2015 UTC,"Yes. The Shadow Tower is the westernmost castle along the wall. It stops at the Frostfangs. However, traversing the Frostfangs is more dangerous than climbing the wall."

gameofthrones,3dp1hk,ANukeGuy,3,Sat Jul 18 03:14:12 2015 UTC,"Bowen Marsh basically makes this exact same argument against ranging. He says to just seal the tunnel and be done with it, while others oppose it because it'd make them 'blind' due to not being able to send out rangers. Jon's decision was that he was unwilling to write off the wildlings by sealing the tunnel, and also didn't want to be blind to the approach of the White Walkers, but there definitely was two sides to the argument."
gameofthrones,3dp1hk,catalytica,2,Sat Jul 18 08:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could see that, I can respect scouting the white walkers, the wall probably doesn't do as much against them."

She can glamour herself and others, kinda like the many face god thing.  and most importantly she can see the future in the flames. The problem is she fucks it up sometime because of the way she percieves what she sees.  There is also a part in her POV chapter (she has only one chapter of her own) where she describes how she basically almost never sleep or eat beacuse she doesn't need to. And I don't know how much it was implied in the show, but Mel is probably more than a 100 years old. And she is, according to herself, the most powerful witch even in her order.

Once Talisa came in, Roose started getting curious. When it became obvious that Robb was going to break a marriage alliance, Roose began exploring other options. Blackwater Bay, along with his confirmed suspicions of Robb, just gave him the push he needed. I'll even go as far as to say that asking Robb to let Ramsay retake Winterfell was made sincerely, although he had ideas in the back of his head should things go awry. Which they did.  That's my opinion on show Roose. Book Roose was just looking for something to raise him up from the start."

Where she walked into the Red Keep to find it essentially burned and destroyed. I think that the common folk will riot and as a result Tommen will die. Cersei will be stuck in the Red Keep, summon the pyromancer and tell them to burn them all. She will have no more reason for living as we've seen her kids literally mean everything to her and we all know how vengeful she is. I think this will happen after Jamie returns bearing news of their daughter and once all this boils together.. Boom goes the dynamite. I see this being the only realistic ending for Cersei, and it will finally cause focus for the support of the wall. Kings landing being destroyed will really mean nothing at this point, no one of importance resides there any longer. Little Finger is off doing Little Finger stuff, Varys is with Tyrion, Sansa is at Winterfell, Bran is North of the wall, Jon is at the Wall.. Who's left in Kings Landing that is a main character? Margery, Cersei, and occasionally Lady Orellana and Little Finger if they must go and of course Jaimie. Pretty sure this will be the season 6 series finale. All those characters seem to have hit a dead end with their story lines with the exception of Little Finger and I'm sure he won't be there by this point, he's back at the Eyrie. Once Kings Landing is kaput, it'll give them more time to focus on what really matters. The real war to come. No more Kings Landing politics. Maybe this will be the season finale, maybe it'll be mid season. I feel like this will have to come around mid season, leaving only one season of the war of ice and fire seems lame. I'm not really sure if Margaery will survive. I haven't read the books so don't know how important her character is, but from watching the show it seems like all the story lines in Kings Landing are dead. We'll see."

Despite the fact that you dislike them as a viewer because they are a devoutly religious group, they really are championing more of social revolt than they are a religious one. Thats why the High Sparrow is walking around shoeless (an act that was done to Cersei and she had bloody feet by the end), giving his worldly possessions away, and constantly droning on about ""the many"" (commoners) vs ""the few"" (nobility). They are using religion in order to bring about social justice.  His damn motto throughout has been how no man or woman is above or better than any other man or woman, kings and queens included, and he is absolutely sincere about it, which is why they have been showing him constantly laboring just as much or more than any commoner.

Also, the one thing that really seems to bother them is that lives can't just be taken, they have to be claimed by the Many-Faced God before they come to collect them in his name.

I took it different: a lot of stuff inconsistent to mechanics in the books occurred in this scene. As Arya went blind, she was seeing with her other senses, as Syrio told her long before. So what all seemed like confusing magic that makes no sense at first will become coherent as she realizes she was metaphorically blind before, but can now see. It's an ""up is down"" kind of scene.

gameofthrones,3dn79y,Riggins_33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"My theory is that ""Jaqen's"" entire mission was to recruit Arya Stark for the Faceless Men. If he killed himself, he'd fail his mission, and thus refused.   Why did the Faceless Men go so far out of their way to recruit Arya?  I have absolutely no idea.  But, in a world where coincidences virtually don't exist, there is absolutely no way that Arya saving a magical assassin from another continent who somehow knows her identity and offers to train her to be a Faceless Man despite barely knowing her wasn't a planned meeting.  The Lannisters don't even know who she is (though, arguably, Tywin knew who she was the entire time and just respected her hustle), yet this man from Essos does?  Sure, Faceless Men have an affinity for faces, but nothing we've seen so far in the House of Black and White implies that they have an encyclopedia of living faces in their heads that allows them to know everyone's identity like the Shinigami Eyes from Death Note.  Jaqen knew who Arya was because she was his mission the entire time.  It would also explain why he gave her the Braavosi coin without hesitation, unless the Faceless Men are in the middle of a membership drive and are super desperate to get anyone to join their ranks.  But that's doubtful.  There's something special about Arya Stark that we don't know yet, and it has something to do with the God of Death and/or Lord of Light.  Arya Stark = Azor Ahai fucking confirmed."

Maybe Benjen said something to him, or, perhaps, Jon's parentage is more of an open secret than we thought?  Maybe the only reason more people don't talk about it is because Jon's been out of the game and in Castle Black this entire time?

She's raised on second hand myths.  Whenever either of them say ""X cannot Y a dragon"" they are puppeting the falsenesses that King Aerys taught to Viserys before the Targaryens were forced into exile.   A big point in the books is how Daenerys is both extremely ignorant and very unwilling to learn the truth behind the Targaryens and their horrid past. She will ignore or excuse Barristan when he tries to tell her the truth about Rhaegar and Aerys, and she makes no effort to find out if her version of events regarding ""the usurper dogs"" is even close to accurate.

He surely must have taken a part for himself but he must have run a Ponzi scheme to keep it going for too long without people noticing. So he could've covered what he took with loaned money until both the Crown and the Lannister's funds were nearly depleted.  It should be noted that it doesn't mean he took most of the money though. Robert's excesses just created a great opportunity for him to take advantage of. With so much money flowing, it would make it harder to notice the embezzlement."
gameofthrones,3do2cl,dt25,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:28 2015 UTC,"A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator, an individual or organization, pays returns to its investors from new capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the operator. Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent.   Operator: Littlefinger.  Investors: Iron Bank, Lannisters.  M.O.: He could make money flow from one direction to another while taking his share. Every time money flowed, the Crown accrued debt that would be later covered by an investor while increasing the debt to the point that the Crown's debts can never be paid. It's like paying debts on a credit card using another credit card. The debt only gets higher and whoever has to foot the bill at the end is going to have a bad time while whoever actually used the cards reaps all the benefits and none of the responsibility."

Balancing the long term economic future over the crown against Roberts demands for extravagance meant LF borrowed from Tywin and Braavos likely with the plan to use that as a hold over as other investments brought in returns.   TL;DR Littlefinger invested all the crown's money in various ventures and borrowed to cover running costs. Then the war came and the a lot of investments were lost/the new MoC hasn't tracked them down."
gameofthrones,3do2cl,dongazine_supplies,2,Sat Jul 18 07:32:26 2015 UTC,"In books it makes it clear that LF doesn't leave gold laying around he invests it heavily.   Another thing they make clear is that if he actually wants to make money, he can. It's not just smoke and mirrors. When he was reassigned from customs master at Gulltown to Master of Coin in King's Landing, his successor never found any evidence of massive borrowing or ponzi schemes or anything to explain where all the increased revenue in Gulltown came from, he really did make the Vale a ton of money for real.   When the war came it wiped many ledger clean (investments burnt, sunk, and stolen, the people holding the debt killed) and Tyrion wasn't hand long enough to track down the investments.   I would suspect a significant chunk of that money found it's way to Baelish while simultaneously disappearing off the ledgers."

gameofthrones,3dofvh,LogicalLion,24,Fri Jul 17 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"This would seem more like a GRRM way of handling the situation   Why? Seriously, why does everyone in this sub think that GRRM is trying to torture his readers? True, his work is a little more realistic than other fantasy writers, but it's not bleak just for the sake of being bleak. I just don't get this argument that he'll throw out all conventions in order to piss people off."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,SnowWight,7,Fri Jul 17 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"To be fair, GRRM's more recent story developments have shown that the bad guys do, in fact, get punished at some point more often than not. You can only be so big of a dick."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,Rosebunse,-6,Sat Jul 18 05:17:37 2015 UTC,"I think we're on the same page. This DOES seem like a more realistic way of handling it. The people of Westeros have to figure out how to handle the world people of Westeros created, not a godsend who neatly ties up all the loose ends and saves the day.   I realize that Westeros is not a ""real"" place and that ""people"" doesn't do justice to the characters remaining in the story, (faceless men, red priests/priestesses, white walkers). But having mortal men solve the impending doom and chaos without the help of Gods and prophesied heros seems more like GRRM's ""realistic writing style""."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,SnowWight,6,Sat Jul 18 00:10:29 2015 UTC,"I don't see Jon as a godsend who neatly ties up loose ends. In fact, I doubt the gods in this story are even real. I'm expecting a whole lot of people to die before it's over, but I think the difference between books and show for me is the idea of hope. I see more hope in the books."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,SnowWight,0,Sat Jul 18 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to tell you we agree. Not trying argue. I am simply putting forth the idea or possibility of something else then what you and I think will/should happen. And the more i think about it, the more it seems possible."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,SnowWight,2,Sat Jul 18 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to argue with you either. My response is more to the sub in general than to your specific post. I see post after post along the lines of ""Everyone will die and the White Walkers will win because that's GRRM's way,"" when I don't know where they got that idea. He has written other books, and they aren't that nihilistic.   I'm starting to wonder if it's a response to the show, rather than the books. The show has made Big Shocking Moments its bread and butter, so now everyone is expecting tragedy with every episode practically. I guess that's the cost of trying to condense a massive story into 10-episode seasons. They cut out everything but water cooler stuff."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,SUBJUGATOR001,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:43:54 2015 UTC,"Very possible I am mid the books myself. I've seen all the show.   But honestly, do you think there is zero possibility of Westros saving itself without Jon Snow?   Really the idea of a mortal ""average"" person/people saving the world is a more hopeful and uplifting story than relying on higher forces or a grand scheme in the cosmos.   Moral of the story: There can be a ""chosen one"", but men and women can salvage themselves and the world without one. At least it seems like a possibility to me.  Honestly while writing that I realized how deep of a concept that could be. It could unite religions in the real world (Earth) without forcing someone to admit in the failure of their own religion. (You believe in Jesus or Mohammed or Budda? Great so lets work together and solves the problems of our world). But I might be wandering a bit too far with my theories now."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,Starfishsamurai,3,Sat Jul 18 00:55:12 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't say there's zero possibility of that. I just think it would mean that the writing leading up to it was misleading at best. He would have dedicated five books to setting up a character that went nowhere, including creating a mystery surrounding his birth. Plus, after Ned and Robb, it just feels like the last straw for a lot of readers. How many times can he build someone up then knock them down before people have had enough?  But what about a modified version of what you're saying? What if Jon comes back and is part of that rag-tag team that saves the world, maybe even its leader, but isn't a superhero and just does the best he can? Because that's more what I envision. These theories that say he'll come back and marry Daenerys and they'll save the world on the backs of dragons? That one doesn't feel right to me."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,Starfishsamurai,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. And the theory you just described I can get behind.

gameofthrones,3dofvh,SexualWeasel,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:03:25 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter. GRRM loves to set up a possible plot line then leave us with the loose ends of unfullfillment.   Just to reiterate I WANT Jon to return, I'm just exploring the very real possibility that he doesn't."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,DTCMusician,5,Fri Jul 17 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"I think GRRM does that a lot but only if it's there to explore the worst of humanity that makes you question the reason they are all still going on. The story really focuses mainly on the storylines of Jon and Daenerys and with one of those huge story lines gone, the wildlings are basically gone and the last hope of killing the white walkers is lost with his knowledge of valyrian steel and dragon glass (even if sam succeeds in becoming a maister and learns more it will be too late).   Jon needs to return in order to lead the true fight against the white walkers, hopefully with daenerys.   Plus his death allows him to leave the nights watch without breaking his vows. He didn't leave because he knew that he would be completely breaking his vows. Now that he is free from them, he can help out with the wildlings or hopefully find his way to Daenerys with Mel as she is probably the true chosen champion of the god of light."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,ororis,2,Sat Jul 18 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"I would be totally happy with that, but unfortunately what ""needs"" to happen isn't decided by you and me. The only thing that ""needs"" to happen is what GRRM decides.  Just for the sake of imagination, allow me to create an analogy. When watching the show I thought Drogo needs to acquire ships and lead Daenerys and his army to Westeros. But Drogo died, then Daenerys took a different path and became a power all her own. Now, (just for imagination), what if another character, such as Sansa or Theon who flee to the wall have to step up in the wake of Jon's death to become something similar to Daenerys.  I'm not trying to advocate the above as a reasonable theory (Sansa/Theon). I'm just pointing out there are still possibilities even after an unforeseen death and an unfilled prophecy."
gameofthrones,3dofvh,Allison_Tyler,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:08 2015 UTC,"I do agree that that is a possibility but I do believe that using Jon as purely character development for another character would be a bad decision. People already feel like they've been stalling for a few seasons now so stopping the progression of such an important character just to spend a season or two building up another is a bad idea.   Jon was so close to becoming something great, the one thing holding him back was his loyalty to a group of people that hated him. Without the vows keeping him at castle black, he can move on to do great things. Jon was the only person in the show who was actively trying to save the world from the white walkers. (Stannis was looking for the glory of the prophecy and killed innocents along the way).   The white walkers are going to be brought back in one of two ways:   Jon is revived and helps someone (Daenerys or the wildings or bran etc.) confront the white walkers or he becomes a white walker himself and there's a whole new ""one with the free people"" situation. Jon stays dead and another character is affected by it, inspiring them to become something like Daenerys. The White Walkers are largely set aside in the next season as they grow a bigger army and the final season is the destruction they bring to westeros.   Whichever is the more satisfying scenario is really up for debate as killing everyone in westeros would stop all the war and all of the pain and suffering that goes on within it. Jon becoming the hero and stopping the white walkers somehow would not be very GRRM but it would work great with the 2 season's we supposedly have left of GoT.   Either way, we have no clue what is going to happen. GRRM would really surprise us if he actually gave us a happy ending for once. (Lots of people are expecting a Jon/Daenerys relationship in the future and Jon/Daenerys ruling over westeros would be a pretty happy ending; until they get poisoned of course.)"
gameofthrones,3dofvh,Rosebunse,2,Sat Jul 18 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'm really struggling to think of him setting up plotlines that don't go anywhere just to torment the readers. I honestly can't think of anything. Maybe I'm just invested enough into the story where I can see the narrative reasoning behind everything, but I can't think of anything that meets the description of the sorta 'gotcha' that you're describing. I think you're confusing the show with the books too much - I mean, in the books, there's massive foreshadowing for nearly every major event in the form of prophetic dreams/visions/etc. Nothing really comes out of left field that much. So I don't really buy a theory that says that just because every single time he's had foreshadowing something's come to pass that he suddenly wants to do the exact opposite just to screw with us. How does that make sense?"
gameofthrones,3dofvh,Ninja_Bum,8,Sat Jul 18 08:06:35 2015 UTC,"This post only proves many of the people in this subreddit have started to believe that GRRM only writes a story to make the situation worse and worse. Doing anything but reviving Jon would be poor storytelling. Every single thing has pointed at Jon as the main character and hero of the story, I understand killing him off would be a total shock and major twist, but this is Game of Thrones, not Game of Twists; the story has it's fair share, but this one is just ridiculous. I'm fairly certain Jon's death was written in order to relieve him from his vows to the Night's Watch... ya know, to allow him to claim titles. The North needs a Warden who's a Stark, afterall."

gameofthrones,3dnb3y,Lord_NiteShade,10,Fri Jul 17 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've said this same thing many times as well. It's annoying when I see headlines that say things like ""JON SNOW CONFIRMED DEAD BY DIRECTOR TO PRESIDENT OBAMA...""  Who is arguing that he isn't dead, at least at the moment in the show version? The guy got stabbed with big blades over and over and is left in the snow as what looks like a lifeless corpse, with blood everywhere and no one around or any maester nearby for hundreds of miles.   Of course he's dead.... at this moment in the show. So saying ""Jon is dead"" means absolutely nothing, whether you tell that to the POTUS or the Pope. That reveals nothing that most fans don't already understand."

gameofthrones,3dnb3y,Benassiesto,3,Sat Jul 18 12:59:10 2015 UTC,And Jon Targaryen will be born! Don't pretend like it wouldn't be cool if his hair and eyes changed to the typical Valyrian look when he's resurrected.
gameofthrones,3dnb3y,Lord_NiteShade,2,Sat Jul 18 15:31:33 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. Not every Targaryen has the Valyrian look, thats specifically why they inbred.   Rhaeyns looked like Elia, while Aegon looked like Rhaegar. Baelor Breakspear looked like his mother with black hair.   Jon also wouldnt be a ""Targaryen.""  That would imply one of two impossible scenarios.  1: Rhaegar ""married"" Lyanna, with a Septon and everything. This would be Polygamy, which is illegal in Westeros. The Targaryens abandoned this practice when they took the Seven, and the few that broke it were despised.  2: Jon is a bastard (duh), and is legitimized by the King as a Targaryen. Seeing as he is a black brother he can't be legitimized, part of their ""take no vows, hold no lands"", and even if he could King Tommen First of his Name isnt going to legitimize a rival claimant."
gameofthrones,3dnb3y,Benassiesto,3,Sat Jul 18 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"It's true about the look, but we don't fully understand the nature of resurrections either. I'm simply saying it would be neat if his appearance changed to reflect the blood of the dragon in him.   As far as being legitimized, I was also just kidding with wild speculation. R+L=J would have to be proven to a king or queen that would believe it and want Jon to be legitimized as a Targ (aka Dany)."

gameofthrones,3dnb3y,SnowWight,7,Fri Jul 17 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree that he's not going to stay dead (although he is dead right now). But I don't think that logic holds up when you consider that Charles Dance (Tywin) came back after season 4 to film Tywins funeral scene for season 5. And the girl who plays Mycella is also back in Belfast for filming, and most assume Myrcella is really dead, but they'll still need to film her funeral and stuff."

You don't know what the other characters will be wearing, other context, etc. Also, it's a jerk move - an attempt to avoid paying the actor for showing up in another episode."
gameofthrones,3dnb3y,Rosebunse,2,Sat Jul 18 01:38:57 2015 UTC,"Actors aren't paid per episode they shoot, they are paid per episode they appear. That's why some actors can still make bank by just appearing in flashbacks or the opening title."
gameofthrones,3dnb3y,SnowWight,3,Sat Jul 18 03:24:45 2015 UTC,I do believe the corpse shots of Tywin and Joffrey were done as much as a little tribute to their actors as anything. They were very well-respected and liked by their co-stars and crew members.

gameofthrones,3dkarn,GRVrush2112,60,Thu Jul 16 23:23:16 2015 UTC,"Splinter/Related theories to R+L=J   The Identity of the Knight of the Laughing Tree   In the post I did on the Tourney at Harrenhall this past season...Link... I covered what happened when a mystery knight turned up at Harrenhall and entered the lists.. I won't repeat too much of what I covered in that post, other than pointing out the description of the mystery knight.. The Knight of the Laughing Tree  (KotLT) is said to be small of stature, wore mismatched and unfitting armor, and spoke in a loud booming... some say disguised voice.  The Mystery Knight also wore the sigil of a laughing wierwood tree (earning him his nickname).  The Mystery knight was successful in defeating the knights who's squires had teased Howland Reed the previous day, and which Lyanna Stark had broken up.. And from this come our two leading candidates as to who this mystery knight was... Howland Reed and Lyanna Stark..  Now I do not have any evidence that suggests that Howland Reed was not the KotLT.. but I hope to present the evidence or reasons why many readers believe this to be Lyanna Stark.  First of all we know quite a bit about Lyanna's character.. What we know from Arya (who reminds all who knew Lyanna, of Lyanna), it is said the characters are very similar.. Lyanna was said to be very tomboyish, somewhat skilled at arms, and adept at horseriding.  It is not out of the realm of possibility that Lyanna could have donned the armor of the KotLT and entered the lists to challenge the knights who's squires had bullied Howland Reed.  The small stature, the mistmatched armor, the sigil of a wierwood (Wierwoods being associated with the North) disguising her voice to sound masculine all potentially fits with the KotLT.. But this I admit is all circumstantial... But if Lyanna is the KotLT it makes a few following events make much more sense.. After the KotLT disappears we know that many sought to unmask the mystery knight, and King Aerys himself sent Rhaegar Targaryen to track the KotLT down.. The official story goes that Rhaegar could not track down the knight and found only his shield, with the sigil of the laughing wierwood hanging in a heart tree outside of Harrenhall..  But what if that was a lie, what if Rhaegar did track down the Knight, and discovered it was Lyanna?  That would have been their first meeting, and suddenly Rhaegar placing that crown of winter roses on Lyanna's lap, seemingly out of no where, has a bit of logic to it.  It explains how and where they first met, and how they became so enamored with each other.    Well that's the KoTLT, let's move on..   The Harp in the Crypts.   First of all this section will basically consist of a TL;DR of an amazing post posted to the asoiaf subreddit about 2 years ago.  I suggest everyone check out the theory out Here But for this post I will summarize the general outline here.   Throughout the books it is hinted at that something awaits Jon in the Winterfell crypts, he often dreams of something waiting for him there.. Many readers have long since speculated that something related to R+L=J is being kept there, in or near Lyanna's tomb something that will confirm to Jon his heritage.. For years the prevailing idea was that it was a bridal cloak, but it wasn't until this theory was posted that it seems all along a more likely contender was probable.  That being that Rhaegar's Harp was being kept in the Winterfell crypts, in the tomb of Lyanna Stark. Why is it there, the theory hypothesizes that it could have been a part of the promise Ned made to Lyanna, not only to protect Jon, but to protect his legacy as well.    This theory serves not only the purpose of an additional piece of evidence for R+L=J, but also answers the question of “Even if Jon finds out his heritage, how will he prove it”. First of all let's discuss the harp itself.  When people talk of Rhaegar, his kind nature and chivalrous attitude are not all that are mentioned.  When people speak of Rhaegar, mention of his musical ability, and his unique harp are just as often brought up.  The harp is said to have a unique look, and a unique sound.. But most importantly many people, currently alive in the series, remember seeing the harp, and remember hearing the harp being played by Rhaegar.. and that is the key.. It is a relic that if found by Jon, could be used as a piece of evidence for his legitimacy to the entire realm..   There is a lot more to Rhaegar's harp that I cannot fit into this post, please, please click the link I provided and read the full theory.. it's a delight.   Benjen Stark and the Night's Watch.    One of the minor mysteries surrounding ASOIAF is the exact reason Benjen Stark joined the Night's Watch.  Now on surface level his joining makes absolute sense.. He was the 3rd son of of Lord Rickard Stark, not liable to inherit anything.. And for thousands of years the ranks of the Night's Watch has been manned by third and fourth sons of House Stark, Benjen joining is certainty not out of the ordinary.  So where am I going with this?  Why would Benjen joining the Night's Watch have anything to do with Lyanna, Rhaegar, or Jon?    Admittedly there is no real evidence for the theory I am about to present, nothing beyond speculation.. but It's fun to speculate, and I think it fits the overall narrative of the story if this to be the case.. So what is the theory?  The theory goes that the reason Benjen Stark joins the Night's Watch is because he knew of, or possibly participated (by way of giving Lyanna away in marriage) in Lyanna running away with Rhaegar before Robert's Rebellion, and that since his silence (or actions) inadvertently led to the deaths of his father, brother, sister, the royal family, and the countless deaths that occurred in the rebellion filled him with such guilt that he joined the Night's Watch as an act of atonement.  Now, as I said there is very little evidence to support this, but there are a few other reasons why I think this fits.  First of all after the war Benjen was no longer the third son behind a growing line of additional heirs.. His brother Ned was Lord now, and he was behind his newly born nephew Robb as heir to Winterfell.. Even if he expected his brother to have more children (which he did), we are in a post war Winterfell, certainly Benjen would have guessed his brother would need him by his side after the chaos that was Robert's Rebellion, especially considering Ned himself never expected to be a Lord.  Benjen's joining of the Night's Watch could almost be seen as an abandonment of Ned in a time of need.. But if we follow the line of him joining out of guilt.. it makes that decision a bit more sensible.  Lastly, Why would Benjen have known (or Participated) in Lyanna running away with Rhaegar, and why would he have kept it a secret?  From what little the readers have on Benjen's and Lyanna's relationship we know that they were close.  With Ned away in the Vale, and Brandon a Lord in training the two were each others closest companions the only real sibling relationship that existed amongst that generation of Stark children.   The two sparred with each other (part of what leads to Lyannas skill at arms), during the feast at the tourney at Harrenhall Benjen teases Lyanna for weaping at Rhaegar's harp playing causing Lyanna to turn wine over her young brother's head.. All in all it seems to the reader that we are to gather that they had a very strong older sister/younger brother relationship.. and that Benjen would keep a secret of Lyanna's, or do anything for his big sister, no matter what it was... One of which had the biggest impact on Benjen's life.      Character Limit again... concluded in reply"
gameofthrones,3dkarn,rebelkids,42,Thu Jul 16 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"Splinter/Related Theories continued   How does Jon find out?   This last bit will act as a closing and a bit of a summation of all that has been stated so far, and answers for us that if all of this is true, how will Jon find out in the books and possibly the show.. (Small note, this assumes that he survives or comes back from his stabbing at the end of ADWD/S5...but that goes without saying).. Well as we have established that there are several people that could have potential knowledge of Jon's parentage.  The most obvious being Howland Reed.. as the only living survivor of the Tower of Joy, and only living witness to the events of what happened there he is the obvious answer.. He is currently at home at Greywater Watch in the Neck.. how, if, and when he emerges in the story will remain to be seen.. But he is defiantly an avenue of how Jon could uncover the truth.   As I talked about in the last section It is possible that Benjen knows about Jon, or at the very least about Lyanna and Rhaegar, and could either tell him outright or help set him on the right path.. Fortunately for the plot he has conveniently disappeared for 4 novels and seasons.. but not confirmed dead.. Now would be a great time for him to reemerge.    While they may not be fully aware of the full story I hope I have demonstrated that it's obvious that House Dayne knows more than they let on in regards to the origin of Ned's Bastard.. Wylla acting as a red herring, and the Daynes helping propagate that false rumor is suggestive of that alone. How much do they truly know?  Like I said earlier, House Dayne is going to be one to pay much attention to going forward.   It is possible for Jon to find out for himself.. If Rhaegar's harp is in the Winterfell crypts and Jon discovers it, it seems plausible that he could put two and tow together himself and realize his true heritage, more likely in combination with any of the other options mentioned above.   However there is one more intriguing option, a way that R+L=J could be confirmed to us the readers/viewers, and to Jon potentially, and it involves his half brother Bran... But here's where I have to drop a small spoiler warning.. This next bit will involve probable spoilers going forward into Season 6, based off a Bran chapter in ADWD.. I will hide it behind a tag, and It is still speculation in regards to R+L=J, but involves Bran's plot likely to be shown in some form in Season 6.... If you wish to stop here, I will catch you in the outro.. if not here we go..  Spoilers ADWD/Speculation TWOW  ..continued  ..continued    Well, that's it for anything and everything related to R+L=J that I could muster.. I hope you have enjoyed reading this..

gameofthrones,3dkarn,b_sinning,65,Sat Jul 18 01:16:55 2015 UTC,"One of the strongest pieces of evidence is present in both the books and the HBO series. Before Jon heads North, Ned says to Jon, ""Your of my blood."" and promises to talk about Jon's mother the next time they see each other. Not, ""your my son,"" but, ""my blood,"" indicating some indirect relation.  Also, since Jon is heading off North to the Wall, the next time Ned and Jon would meet would logically be after Jon has taken the Black. Once Jon has taken the Black, any claim he had over the Iron Throne disappears (""Night Gather's, and now my Watch Begins. It Shall not End Until My Death. I Shall Take No Wife, Hold No Lands, Father No Children. I Shall Wear No Crown, And Win No Glory).    For Jon to possibly have any claim to the throne, he would have to die, and there is no way a deadman could possible come back to take the throne.  cough  Anyway, Aemon Targaryen had taken the Black, and Robert had never marched North to the Wall for Aemon's head. So, once Jon was a Crow, it would be safe for Ned to reveal Jon's true parentage."
gameofthrones,3dkarn,Atheose_Writing,6,Fri Jul 17 01:02:17 2015 UTC,What if Jon dies from the stabbing and is brought back to life?

I'm sure after his death at Night Watch hands he'll see that they aren't the best option for him anymore. I could see him somehow ending up with Daenerys. Both have legit claims to thrones and aren't brother and sister but cousins. Marrying cousins was acceptable back then. The marriage would unify both kingdoms against a common outside enemy.

Tommen is basically a sitting duck, he doesn't have the strength to be king and stand up to Cersei and Tywin. And a lot of people in the realm already don't like the Lannisters and believe that Tommen is the illegitimate son of Cersei and Jamie, nullifying his claim to the throne. Additionally, if the people of the North have proof that Jon is a legitimate Stark via Lyanna, I can see them rallying behind him to overthrown the Boltons in Winterfell."

I found out about the R+L=J theory before the last season aired, and it seemed to make so much sense (and certain scenes this series appear to confirm it).   However, I'd learned/heard the theory that Rhaegar had raped Lyanna, but then read more mid-season (when I subscribed to this subreddit..) that in fact they were in love.   The information about Benjen is fantastic, love it. I didn't really get a sense of Ned's extended family from the show. You know Benjen is his younger brother, but I've learned more about Brandon, Rickard and Lyanna's death from reading posts like these than just from the show.   Personally, I hope that Benjen comes back to reveal to Jon his heritage and tell him to look in the crypt at Winterfell. I also think Benjen coming back to the Wall would allow him to take over as Lord Commander and free Jon of his duties (and hopefully lopping of Thorne and Olly's heads while he's at it!) if/when he's resurrected.   Although Benjen suddenly rocking up is a little bit Stark Ex Machina."

Which just means that my entire interpretation of whole chunks of the story was completely off.  That being that the reign of the Targaryans was completely dead and ended. That was what I had hoped for. That they represented the last stubborn remnants of the old ways... the old ""magics"" in the world... or at least the ""Fire"" side of the story. And that they were dying out to pave the way for cultural and technological advancement instead.  The way I figured it, the ""Fire"" of the story was already dead, and it just remained for the ""Ice"" (i.e. the Others) to get killed off too. But no.  The further through the story I've got, the more it has seemed like the Targaryans cling on and try to crawl back. The more it seems like superstition, ""magic"" and such old-fashioned nonsense is coming back stronger than ever.  That it seems more like a resurrection of all the magical stuff than of its death.  And frankly it just makes it all so much more depressing.  It is like a world that stubbornly refuses to progress, and bitterly clings to its own stagnant rot until there is no hope of redemption. That the war between the pyromaniac nutcases and the winter forces will go on forever, with everyone else suffering inbetween.  So yeah.  Jon Snow = Jon Targaryan? Then let us hope he stays dead."

It's about putting the last of the pieces in play for the climax. If you look at any trilogy in fiction, what is generally the weakest part? The middle chapter, because it doesn't have a definite beginning or a real satisfactory end. It just kinda... happens.  I fully expect Season 6 and onward to hit the ground running."

I think that if anything Season 5 will be considered the weakest because it's like the Two Towers; nothing of any real consequence happens. Dany is still spinning her wheels and most of the big, epic, sweeping confrontations we were salivating over (like The Mannis vs The Boltons) didn't have nearly the impact or the far reaching consequences we (or maybe just I) were hoping for. Hardhome was incredible as a standalone piece of television, what happened in the last few minutes of season 5 was a nut punch from a Kryptonian, but in comparison to the previous four seasons, can you really think of anything else that happened that, well, matters in the overall narrative?  That's really what I mean. When we have all the pieces for the climax we'll be able to look back and see that Season 5 was necessary, but it was kind of clumsy in how it got to where it needed to go.  I'll grant Empire as the exception though. Empire Strikes Back is the rare exception to the rule."

For example: People don't like superman because he's a ""Mary Sue"" or someone that can virtually be unstoppable and kill off any enemy but he usually has to go to great lengths to do it.  Now put Ramsey up there, he kills many Iron Born warriors whom are most likely more experienced than he, and he does it shirtless.  You can't plot against him because he knows everything and has everyone flayed.  AND he somehow is part of a super battle against the Baratheons and i think he kills like 36 guys judging from the bodies around him, and the lack of alive Boltons by him.  Is it good to have a bad guy like this? yeah in a slasher film, is it good to have a bad guy like this in Game of Thrones where we throw aside the usual plot armor for main characters? no, it hurts the rest of the story.  Honestly what is the point of him? I thought GRRM's point was that there is no good or bad, just shades of gray?  Ramsay basically proves that wrong because what has he done that is good? serve his terrible father? What is a redeeming quality about him? Loyalty? that's virtually all I can think of."
gameofthrones,3diolk,Duh_And_Or_Hello_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:14:35 2015 UTC,"Because the Good guys die off like flies, while he virtually is a bad guy super villain with no real threat ever facing him, save for trying to impress his father who also has thick plot armor.   Would you like me to name the amount of characters who have appeared in more than two seasons of Game of Thrones? This is just straight up exaggeration. Maybe he hasn't died because he's literally only been in two battles as far as we know? I'm sure plenty of people can survive two battles. I don't get why he has plot armor, yet people like Tyrion, Jon Snow, Bran Stark, Davos, Bronn, The Hound, The Mountain (who literally came back to life), Melissandra, Littlefinger, Grey Worm, Varys, and Dany don't. Most of them have been in way more situations in which they were likely to die, but no, it's Ramsay who has the plot armor.    Now put Ramsey up there, he kills many Iron Born warriors whom are most likely more experienced than he, and he does it shirtless. You can't plot against him because he knows everything and has everyone flayed. AND he somehow is part of a super battle against the Baratheons and i think he kills like 36 guys judging from the bodies around him, and the lack of alive Boltons by him.   So, your points are he got lucky in one fight, knows what's going on in the city that he is in charge of, and didn't die in a fight where his forces were up by at least 2:1 in terms of manpower? First of all, of course he's going to employ spies and the like to try to squash any rebellions before they start up. The Boltons know how hated they are. I'm sure plots like that are snuffed out in King's Landing literally every other day. Second of all, the idea that he killed 36 Baratheon soldiers is pure speculation with nothing to back it up. Ramsay is a complete sadist. What's way more likely is that the battle is over, and he told all of his soldiers he wanted to be the one to finish off all the severely injured Baratheon soldiers because that's basically what gets this guy off. Hence, no soldiers around him and a pile of dead bodies.   Honestly what is the point of him? I thought GRRM's point was that there is no good or bad, just shades of gray? Ramsay basically proves that wrong because what has he done that is good? serve his terrible father? What is a redeeming quality about him? Loyalty? that's virtually all I can think of.   What is the redeeming quality of Joffrey? Meryn Trant? Roose? Walder Frey? Any random rapist soldier we run across? The biggest myth about Game of Thrones is that it's not supposed to have pure evil characters. GRRM literally said Breaking Bad motivated him to create a character more evil than Walter White. He didn't say it motivated him to make a morally ambiguous character. GoT and the book series are about telling a good story, and that's about it. There's a lot about human nature in there, too, but nothing to indicate that human nature can't be just the worst thing ever with no redeeming qualities. It's mostly just trying to make a good story, and of course that requires having good guys with bad qualities and bad guys with good qualities, but it doesn't mean you can't have just good guys (Jon Snow) or just bad guys (Ramsay Bolton). Also, the fact that you managed to find one redeeming quality for Ramsay is pretty remarkable, considering I couldn't think of a single one for Joffrey. Meryn Trant, Walder Frey, or his father. So that makes him less one-dimensional than all those characters."

gameofthrones,3dlzdp,Paanorama,20,Fri Jul 17 10:15:55 2015 UTC,"I think you're mixing two things together.  GRRM doesn't shy away from graphic violence and sex, because they are very much components of the real world. Whatever you find in his books, you'll find real world examples that are even more extreme.   Back then he had to describe violence but without blood or anything too provocative. He got tired of that. Is this true?   What he always says is that in his time as a TV writer, he always started out with these ambitious scripts, but then he had to make them smaller for budget reasons. Not 10 men on horses, maybe just one man on a horse, stuff like that.   This was his main motivation for writing ASOIAF, a series he could make as big and epic as he wanted to without worrying about budget constraints."

gameofthrones,3dlzdp,gbinasia,7,Fri Jul 17 13:32:41 2015 UTC,"Found the article! It’s in Swedish though but it says…   The bosses always asked him to write more ”action scenes”. – And what is action? It’s bloodless violence. They wanted the car chase, but to actually see people being burned alive after the crash, was too repulsive. They wanted gunshots, but not se heads explode. The more I did it, the more I hated it. It’s ok if you don’t want violence, then you can write ’Mad Men’! But if it’s about war and sword fights, I want to see the consequences. Not the cleaned up version where you don’t show what violence really means.  He also says regarding the sex…  – Sex is an important human emotion. And, doing the classic ’…and then they went to bed’ and start a new paragraph…I want to know what happened! Was it good, was it uncomfortable? It develops the characters, sheds light on them. ’Unmotivated’ is a bullshit word. When critics use it, it really means ’more than I personally was interested in’.  Although, the budget issue is probably as true."

I know this may sound like a circlejerky the books are better than the show hurr durr rant, but face it, the show-snakes sucked. Even unsullied probably don't disagree with that.   Obara would be the warrior, who fights with a spear & whip. Stocky, bulky, and always grim & angry. Her anger often gets in the way of her critical thinking. Lady Nym would be graceful, elegant, sophisticated yet dangerous. The most intelligent of the lot & a scheming player of the game. She would also be the leader of the tribe, and the decision-maker. Tyene would be the wildcard. A Harley Quinn-esque, cute, innocent looking psychopath. Master of poisons. An almost creepy, unsettling demeanor, masked by her 'pure' septa robes.    Looking at the casting, there's nothing wrong with the actors. Each of them could have played these characters perfectly, especially Rosabelli, who's cute yet borderline psychotic performance in the jail scene was actually perfect. As long as Obara didnt have stupid monologues and Nym didnt keep uselessly whipping the air, we could have had a good season with them."

gameofthrones,3dhslc,TheRobbyStark,14,Fri Jul 17 00:10:03 2015 UTC,"Everything.   They follow cliche action girl specialized team trope. Obara and her tired monologue used constantly to remind us who they are. Terrible fight choreography, particularly from whippy and daggery  A weak plot built on convenient timing and questionable motives. A very poor script that totally wastes the potential of the actresses involved, one an Oscar nominee. Time spend on Dorne meant cutting other areas, meaning no Jaime Riverlands arc. An overall oversimplified plot and the exclusion of too many book characters and arcs (the mummers dragon) makes Dorne overall the weakest aspect of the show."
gameofthrones,3dhslc,Quiddity99,3,Fri Jul 17 17:23:48 2015 UTC,well people felt the obara speeches and tyenes lines didn't really fit in the situation. they were just put in. and the fight scenes were pretty bad. I guess it didn't live up to the expectations of how they are portrayed in the books. I haven't read them but it's possible there was a lot left out. i do know tyene is supposed to be a blonde in the book

gameofthrones,3dilnm,kingstoken,55,Thu Jul 16 23:02:22 2015 UTC,Showing that those award shows are a popularity contest more than anything else.
gameofthrones,3dilnm,Phantomshiva,36,Thu Jul 16 23:37:46 2015 UTC,HBO is also the best Emmy-politician in the business. They tailor their submissions to blanket every category. The fact that there is an Emmy for which Diana Rigg could even be nominated is comical. She appears for 5 maybe 10 minutes of total screen time.
gameofthrones,3dilnm,qp0n,12,Thu Jul 16 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Emmy's are bizarre. They nominate on episodic basis, so a ten minute appearance nomination is nothing new."
gameofthrones,3dilnm,finerd,11,Thu Jul 16 16:51:53 2015 UTC,She has been nominated for this role twice already. And I think it is good that there is a Guest category since the famous guest actors could take nominations from from less know actors who have real supporting roles in shows.
gameofthrones,3dilnm,Chinoiserie91,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:35 2015 UTC,its guest star. You can be in one episode for 1 minute and get that award.
gameofthrones,3dilnm,T0astofWar,7,Thu Jul 16 18:10:57 2015 UTC,Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead are by far the most popular shows of the past few years.

gameofthrones,3dilnm,MessOfADreamer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:39:51 2015 UTC,Empire is garbage. The popularity is not always about the amount of people watching. Spacey is the darling of the people who decide............hence another circle jerk. The Wire was arguably the best series that HBO made (excluding The Sopranos). How many Emmys? They might as well just hand them out to House of Cards and Mad Men now.

gameofthrones,3dilnm,The_Golden_Rose,2,Thu Jul 16 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"He basically couldn't submit. The guest star rule is that you have to appear in less than 50% of that season's episodes, and the High Sparrow was in exactly 5/10 episodes, but Pryce didn't have enough screentime to be a supporting nominee either, so yeah... retardedness."
gameofthrones,3dilnm,superpowersam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:33:47 2015 UTC,"He actually supposedly submitted for another program, for which he wasn't nominated.  Maybe he didn't want to put in two nominations."
gameofthrones,3dilnm,kingstoken,10,Fri Jul 17 11:47:13 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Dinklage, I certainly don't think that he was outstanding this season; especially in comparison with some other actors, who shined this year, like Dillane, Alfie or Harington. The Emmys hardly choose for the acting chops of the year; Dinklage proved that he's a great actor in previous years and he's popular, so he's gonna get nominated, even if this season wasn't that good for him.   Lena deserves an award, but Emilia? I love her, but come on. Where's Maisie or Sophie Turner? The Emmys are a joke in my opinion, especially considering this year's nominations for writing and directing."

I felt that she did fine this season, but maybe not good enough for a nom.  Diana Rigg is awesome and definitely deserves to win.  Peter Dinklage is awesome as always, but there were several performances from other actors that I feel were deserving of a nomination, specifically Stephen Dillane, Alfie Allen, and Iain Glen.  Heck, if Emilia Clarke was nominated, then why wasn't Kit Harington?  I felt his performance this season has been his best overall over the show's run, and was certainly better than Clarke this season."

I hope Diana and Lena win, they both did a great job this season. Also I think Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) should have taken Emilia's spot, she was fantastic this season."
gameofthrones,3dilnm,LDreams,7,Sat Jul 18 05:15:46 2015 UTC,I feel like Melisandre as a character is too cheesy and flat for the Emmy's. Van Houten does a great job but it's not a typical award winning role.
gameofthrones,3dilnm,g0kartmozart,5,Thu Jul 16 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"I think that's part of the problem. Van Houten was great as Melisandre, but the Emmys have a very narrow view of roles, that deserve a nomination. I think, it's also why Hardhome wasn't nominated, despite being the best directed and written episode of the season; too much fantasy and magic."
gameofthrones,3dilnm,candypuppet,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Cheesy? Flat? That's not how I would describe Melisandre. You can say a lot of things about her, and cheesy and flat are not one of them, but each to his own. I think she won't win because she doesn't get enough screen time to compete against the other female leades in the show (like Dany). Also, everyone hate her, especially after episode 9. Cersei is no less of a bitch but she got the Shame scene as a sort of redemption."

And Peter, although normally amazing, was quite low key this season, didn't have great material to work with though. I guess his nomination now is a given just because. No merit needed.

gameofthrones,3dilnm,Phantomshiva,22,Fri Jul 17 00:03:39 2015 UTC,Maisie Williams or Sophie Turner should have been nominated over Emilia.
gameofthrones,3dilnm,prodigalfan,14,Fri Jul 17 06:11:25 2015 UTC,Maisie definitely. And Alfie or Stephen Dillane should have got a nomination over Peter.  Also Kit did a far better job this season than Emilia has ever done with her character.

I was surprised that Clarke was nominated because I didn't think other than Dany's conversation with Tyrion that she had much to submit.    I hope Headey wins in supporting actress.  Dinklage had a better submission last year.    The Emmys do have their biases.  It's very rare for teen or child actors to get nominated, despite some excellent performances in recent years.  GoT had Jack Gleason, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, to name a few.  I would also argue that Kiernan Shipka of Mad Men was as worthy of a nomination as her adult costars.  Holly Taylor from the Americans does fine work in a very difficult role that in the hands of a lesser actress could come across as grating, bratty, and whiny.  She makes you feel for Paige Jennings despite her being a brat who doesn't appreciate the measures her parents have taken to protect her from their Russian comrades."

Some of the episodes in the second half were genuinely heartbreaking, and I completely disagree about the Chuck Material. It starts a bit slow, but as the story gains momentum and the pieces that were set up fall into place, they instantly become the crux of Jimmy's story and become legitimately gripping. But I understand that it isn't for everyone. It is a cross between Breaking Bad and Mad Men, but there are few cheap thrills (which scares away a lot of the audience) and the plot focuses almost exclusively on thematic repercussions and character development. And it does it masterfully in my opinion."

No one in any position of power has seen Arya in a long time, so only Theon recognizes the deceit when she gets there.  Most of the Sansa scenes in Winterfell in the show are based off of Jeyne Poole in the books, because reintroducing a character who had all of 15 seconds screen time in season one didn't make as much sense as putting a character we all recognized in her place."

gameofthrones,3dkyho,it-was-taken,6,Fri Jul 17 04:05:02 2015 UTC,No...I saw that. It just seems like a stretch for the beginning of the story let alone the current situation. That number isn't backed up in the wiki anymore than my vague recollections.  Show wise I think 150 being left before the battle of the wall is a rather generous estimate. I don't have any recourse to sort that out. No access to the older shows in the series and a pile of books where I wouldn't begin to know where I could ferret out that info.   Just my takeaway. Could very well be wrong. At most that sounds like a pre AGOT number though that seems larger than I recall.
gameofthrones,3dkyho,TangentManDan,2,Fri Jul 17 04:17:05 2015 UTC,I don't know the wiki cited chapters from the book...if you really care and don't believe the wiki you can check those chapters

Around year 298 AC, the Watch has dwindled to less than a thousand men, and the quality of recruits has declined as well. During the beginning of year 300 AC, when the Watch chooses a new Lord Commander, a total of 588 votes are cast, indicating that after the losses during the great ranging and the defense of the Wall, the Watch numbers less than six hundred men.""  Another wiki entry. That's not Castle Black...that's the entirety of the Watch overall.  Those numbers at the end would likely include all three of the remaining nights watch forts including the other two operational castles, not just Castle Black. The entire Watch needs to vote on it.  Much like everything else it's rather fuzzy."

Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a scant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that.

gameofthrones,3dkyho,TangentManDan,2,Fri Jul 17 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would indicate there's a lot less than six hundred at castle black, although maybe the vast majority of them are at castle black. Still wouldn't make six hundred, but it could come close to five hundred."
gameofthrones,3dkyho,it-was-taken,2,Fri Jul 17 05:16:44 2015 UTC,It's just hard to tell. Eastwatch is the only port. Seems reasonable they have a decent number of folks there. Shadowtower is the western approach. Also seems likely they'd have a good number of people there.  Can't really give good info on the ratios but Castle Black does seem the place where the vast majority of the losses have occured in the story have happened so far given its our main focus.
gameofthrones,3dkyho,TangentManDan,2,Fri Jul 17 05:25:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah. All of are main characters are at castle black. I do agree with you though, that in the show, it seems like a lot less people, and a lot less room."

It's basically right next to King's Landing, so going back there would end with a naval blockade and his castle under siege.  And this time there wouldn't be someone like Ned to come lift it for him.  Castle Black has a significant tunnel system underneath it in the books, and the castle also seems to be bigger in them.  I do think that the set undersells how big it really is in the show, though.  He could also have housed men in the nearby castles after fixing them up a bit."

gameofthrones,3dkyho,ValarMorHodor,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:48 2015 UTC,That's just because there is no more money in the budget to make it bigger than a few mess halls against the wall.

gameofthrones,3di92m,ColonelBunkyMustard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:59:03 2015 UTC,"The Polish Hussars are from the premodern era, not the late middle ages. Polish Hussars carried wings, lances, and also flintlock pistols. They were rarely involved in the sort of combat that dismounted men-at-arms (on which Robert Baratheon is based) took part in."
gameofthrones,3di92m,iamthemoistness,0,Fri Jul 17 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I would like to say I am aware that the helmet is a towarzysz husaria szyszak and am aware that they were worn by the Polish husaria from 1570s-1770s following Stephen Bathory's military reforms. The point of displaying the helmet in the post was to demonstrate a more battlefield appropriate size that would be more suitable for Rhaegar's helmet. Clearly they aren't dragon wings. I would also remind you that a significant portion of helmets used in the TV show are not medieval helmets and are in fact from the early modern era. The ""Bolton"" helmet is an Italian style morion, the Gold Cloaks wear szyszaks very similar to those used by Ottoman sipahi, the Baratheons of both Renly and Stannis wear burgonets, and even Loras Tyrell's hemet, an armet, was most popular during the 16th century. I would also point out szyszaks were used for hundreds of years by the Ottoman Turks and many Eastern European armies during the Middle Ages, before being adopted by cuirassiers, harquebusiers, and husaria in the post-medieval age.   I will also remind you that Robert Baratheon delivers the coup de grace with his warhammer to Rhaegar Tarygaryen while both of them are on horseback(this is clearly descibed in the books despite many examples of artwork showing them on foot). Interestingly enough, Polish Husaria were expected to be equipped with, in addition to their hollow lances, pistols, szablas(saber), palasz(backsword), and koncerz(mounted estoc), either a battle-axe or nadziak(horseman's pick) which is a type of spiked warhammer designed to be used by a mounted soldier. After their charge into enemy ranks, the the husaria were expected to discard their now-broken lances and extricate themselves from the melee wielding warhammers in the same fashion that Robert used at the battle of the Trident."
gameofthrones,3di92m,ColonelBunkyMustard,2,Fri Jul 17 18:32:10 2015 UTC,"No, that would have been common in tournaments, sure, but not in battle. It's too unwieldy.   Source: History student"
gameofthrones,3di92m,iamthemoistness,3,Fri Jul 17 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"we know that that isn't true. Aside from medieval knights, there are dozen of even more recent examples of crested helmets being used in combat. Samurai wore elaborate crested or horned kabuto on the battlefield, dragoons and cuirassiers often had plumes and horsehair crests on their helmets. Husaria from Poland often had wings on their szyszak helms. That isn't even mentioning Ancient Greeks and Macedonians who are shown on many pieces of artwork sporting elaborate crests and plumes while in battle. We also know that they aren't too unwieldy because people do reenactments using these helmets."
gameofthrones,3di92m,ColonelBunkyMustard,2,Fri Jul 17 11:56:06 2015 UTC,You didn't mention a single medieval example.
gameofthrones,3di92m,iamthemoistness,2,Fri Jul 17 12:42:45 2015 UTC,"Firstly, there isn't  any need to since that was what my previous comment stated. Secondly, do you really think that people wore crests, plumes and symbols on their helmets for hundreds of years and then stopped, right at the point where armor was wore most frequently and heavily, and then after a few hundred years started again just out of the blue? There are plenty of helmets from the medical times that have points on the tops of the helms to fasten heraldry and plumes. Your previous comment claimed that they weren't used in battle. I gave you examples of helmets that couldn't be confused with tournament helms to prove my point."
gameofthrones,3di92m,ColonelBunkyMustard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:02:53 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Give me some examples of medieval helmets with plumes or crests that were used in battle. I'm undergrad historian who has studied medieval European arms and armor. I'm telling you that it didn't happen. If you will show me an example of a medieval helmet with plumage or a way to fasten plumage then I will admit that you are right. But no, Ancient Greeks or Samurai have nothing to do with Medieval warfare in Europe.  Here's a link to the Wallace Collection's catalogue, it has several examples of helmets with attachments for plumage or cresting. All of them are from after 1500 and all of them are for tilting (jousting) or parades. https://archive.org/details/catalogueeurope00lakigoog"
gameofthrones,3di92m,iamthemoistness,2,Fri Jul 17 13:24:48 2015 UTC,"First, I feel the need to point out some contradictions to your argument.   My first statement said that medieval helmets were often decorated but not to the extent show in the picture.  Your first comment to the thread was:   No, that would have been common in tournaments, sure, but not in battle. It's too unwieldy.   I feel like I adequately disproved this by giving you examples of helmets that can't be confused with tilting helms to demonstrate that having reasonably sized decoration wouldn't impede combat.   you claimed that these examples were not important because they weren't from the same time period, but that doesn't makes sense. If a man from 300BC can fight while using a plumed helmet, and a man from the 1600AD can fight while wearing a plumed helmet then a man from 1300 should be capable of fighting with a hemet of the same fashion, regardless of whether he actually did or not. That should have addressed your original comment about them being too unwieldy.   That being said, the there is a distinctive helm in the Prague Castle with an ornate eagle head visor with a pair of sunbursts that are fastened by the same rivets used to hold the visor on. http://traveladdictsnet.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Czech-Republic-Prague-Castle-arrow.jpg  Also there are a number of armets made during the mid 15th century that have slots in the central comb for plumes. example: http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/20.150.1  Morions of the late middle ages and early modern period also have plumes http://www.cowanauctions.com/itemImages/g9734.jpg  Lastly, I will include a piece of artwork from somewhere around 1385, showing a that a few of the bascinets in the painting are sporting golden plumes of some sort. http://deremilitari.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cf650ac3f1d2fc01e94ad438b68986c2.jpg"

He seems too brutish and inelegant to be stag-like. A boar on the other hand is a monstrously strong and stout hairy beast of a creature that is really burly with a little bit of fat just like Robert.

Fathers of those captured went down to retrieve them; thus leading to the Mad King capturing and subsequently killing them (and calling for the heads of R. Baratheon and Ned Stark who were at The Vale of Arryn). The three families and Tullys all rose up in what was called Robert's Rebellion.  (Insert random war events happening here)  The War/rebellion ends at the Battle of the Trident with Robert killing Rhaegar then eventually marching towards Kings Landing (already conquered by the Lannisters). Ned Stark and friends then travel to the Tower of Joy (on the border of Dorne) and find Lyanna and several Targaryean Kingsguard. fight ensues with Ned and Howland Reed being the only survivors and find Lyanna dying from childbirth (supposedly when Jon was born) and thus leading to the beginning of the show where Jon is being raised in Winterfell. (some people have found that the time of the battle of the Tower of Joy and the age of Jon in the show match up and that Jon could be the child of Lyanna Stark.   Went on a bit of a rant but the Rebellion was between 282-283 AD so Rhaegar and Lyanna running off would have happened at the beginning so there should have been enough time for Lyanna to becoming pregnant with Jon."

gameofthrones,3djhbm,athornton436,3,Fri Jul 17 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"I have always loved how Tywin and Eddard are foils to each other. Your points were great. And it is very interesting how Jon is a bastard but a trueborn and is truly treated by Ned like a trueborn rather than the way you would treat a bastard and Tyrion who is supposedly a heir is treated like a bastard. Jon and Tyrion have both the most meaningful relationships with their fathers in the series (despite Jon not interacting with Ned much, Jon is deeply influenced by what kind of person Ned was).  Also Lyanna and Joanna being sillier names are interesting, I noticed that when there is this war ship of Robert's called Lady Lyanna and I wondered why Cersei would not rename it and thought of possible names (she later names another ship Lady Joanna).   But I do not think that Targaryen's not being born of incept will be harmful for babies. If you read World if Ice and Fire you notice that Targaryen marrying outside of family was not that rare. And Dany's parent's were full brother and sister (and their parents full brother and sister, before that 3 generations of Targaryens marrying outside of family) and they had numerous misscarriages, stillborns and a couple of children dying in infancy. And Dany's mother Rhaella finally died giving birth to her (by the way, Jonna died giving birth to Tyrion and Lyanna probably giving birth to Jon so this might be significant some other way). Targaryens probably practiced incest because the likelihood to ride a dragon increases with more pure the blood. They lessened the incest when their dragons died."

gameofthrones,3dphhj,therapy,3,Sat Jul 18 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"I do think a French accent would be too distracting. Far too many mockeries of French accents in British comedy, in particular medieval comedy, for example Monty Python, Black Adder, etc.  Unfair to the French, but there you have it."
gameofthrones,3dphhj,av4rice,6,Sat Jul 18 18:09:37 2015 UTC,What would you prefer?  Much of the show is shot in Northern Ireland and a lot of the actors are British. The plot is partially inspired by the Wars of the Roses in England.

I think these actors could alter their accent a little better.   They do, actually. Many of them use an accent from a different part of Britain for the show, compared to their normal speaking accent outside of the show. There isn't just one British accent.  And just because they could doesn't mean they should. You still haven't given any reason why they should do anything differently."
gameofthrones,3dphhj,MrTurleWrangler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:33:30 2015 UTC,"It's a neutral accent to american audiences so they don't think ""Why are people in a medieval fantasy show speaking in a New Jersey accent?"" Same reason British actors play bad guys in American movies the accent is neutral to avoid slagging off a part of the domestic market.  On top of that Westeros is loosely the UK with King's Landing as london the Wall is Hadrian's Wall, and Winterfell as Sheffield etc. Who play Ed Stark Lord of Winterfell, why Sean Bean from Sheffield.   The Boltons are named after a town in Lancashire and all the northerners speak with Northern accents with southern commoners sounding a bit more cockney. The exception is Davos who has a Geordie accent for literally no reason despite being from King's Landing (aka London)."
gameofthrones,3djvg4,Bronco30,14,Thu Jul 16 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"Well, Lysa DID get pregnant with Petyr's child after he got beat up by Brandon. After Petyr was sent back to his home in the Vale, Hoster made Lysa abort the baby before it was born. I don't think they really had much time together at any point after that and, as far as we know, Petyr never really cared much for her, only ever using her for power and, once long ago, as a substitute for Cat.  As for Robin being weak and sickly, that could just be a result of whatever abortion medicine Lysa took during her first pregnancy, we don't know how any of that stuff works. When he brings him gifts, I think it's just because Petyr knows that Robin is a pretty simple and bratty kid, who still has the power to have them all killed under the right circumstance. It's just a way to keep him happy and docile, so he doesn't cause too much trouble."

gameofthrones,3djvg4,Rosebunse,5,Fri Jul 17 00:16:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're overplayed too much on the show, he's just more of a weakling personality-wise. Robin in the books isn't even really that much of a weak kid, he's just coddled and ignorant of the real world, so he treats everything very strangely. That said, it's hard to say whether he is actually genetically faulty, or if being breastfed till age 8 just totally messed him up."

gameofthrones,3dl5re,Blocky67,13,Fri Jul 17 04:07:08 2015 UTC,I don't think any one person is responsible for ALL of it.. If so we could blame way more on Rhaegar or The Mad king... they were the ones who basically spat at half of the kingdoms.. and than there's lil finger and his scheming.  In the end Robert couldve prevented a lot of things if he were a better king but he was in no way responsible for them.   that's my take on it anyway
gameofthrones,3dl5re,LongShotTheory,6,Fri Jul 17 04:14:47 2015 UTC,Royal incest is the root.  There would've been no Mad King if the guy had healthier genes.
gameofthrones,3dl5re,nailgardener,2,Fri Jul 17 04:16:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I think Joffrey would have been a bit more controlled had he not been so coddled. In fact, if I remember correctly, everyone but Cersei wanted him to be sent to Casterly Rock for a more proper education."
gameofthrones,3dl5re,Rosebunse,3,Fri Jul 17 15:10:32 2015 UTC,In a medieval cultures - they choose leaders by blood - either because they were fathered by leaders or who have taken more and lost less blood in war than their opponents.  The Mad King is a result of the first - an incestuous and small gene pool that results in genetic instability.  Robert is the result of the latter - the warrior who can win a throne but can't govern.  Today we are much more advanced and choose leaders who can become famous and beg for lots of money.   Somehow we seem to still get dynastic families and folks that may not be that ideal to govern their own lives and families - much less the nation.

He was stuck with Cersei who never wanted him and couldn't love him to cement an alliance he didn't care for.  He was never well suited for the Throne, and went to war for Lyanna not the Crown, but he won it and had to take it.  Robert didn't ""cause"" anything, he just reacted to the bad situations he landed in.  Sure, he sometimes made poor decisions that didn't help, but there's a point where you can see the character just didn't care anymore.    Cersei who was apparently crazy about him in the beginning of their marriage.    That's questionable.  I'm pretty sure the ""crazy about him"" all comes from Cersei's POV, and she's capable of lying to herself as well as she does everyone else.  Pre-story background from the books She went into the marriage expecting it to fail, and stuck with it to keep the Crown she wanted and as a cover for her children with Jaime.  It could have been someone else on that Throne, and Cersei would have likely done the exact same thing."

All the bertayals I can think of on top of my head:   Lyanna who was betrothed to him goes off with Rhaegar. Cersei cheats on him with her own brother. Cersei(or was it Joffrey?) kills his bastard children. His hand Jon Arryn(who was nearly like a father to him) gets killed Lysa. His brother Stannis does nothing but talk crap about him because he dared to give him Dragonstone, which was the home of the Targaryans so no small prize. His other brother Renly ignores Stannis' stronger(on paper) right of claim. Stannis kills his own and Robert's baby brother with nasty magic.

I consider that the beginning of 'bad' for the Starks. Add to that Robert's account of Lynna who was Kidnapped by the Mad king's son prior to that, and things didn't end well for her.   So I would say Plenty of bad was happening to the Starks long before we enter the show, and before Robert was King.  I would go so far to say.

gameofthrones,3dibbj,emperor000,37,Fri Jul 17 13:39:58 2015 UTC,We know Lady Stoneheart is Catelyn Stark (at least mostly...)... That's not a theory.
gameofthrones,3dibbj,grilsrgood,2,Thu Jul 16 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"Yea but for people who are only show watchers, they have no idea who lsh is and it's still a theory because it hasn't happened"
gameofthrones,3dibbj,Boyeatsworld,24,Thu Jul 16 15:40:55 2015 UTC,How can it be a theory if there are no signs pointing towards it? Show watcher only people would have never known the name Lady Stoneheart or that her coming back to life was possible.
gameofthrones,3dibbj,Jdog2010,6,Thu Jul 16 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, neither would a book reader before that chapter."
gameofthrones,3dibbj,RaptorDelta,9,Thu Jul 16 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"Well, there was a decent amount of foreshadowing with Nymeria finding Cat in the river. IIRC, it was mentioned that she was thrown in the river. With the BWoB approaching and having Thoros with them, a lot of readers may have thought about what they were going to do with Cat."
gameofthrones,3dibbj,emperor000,4,Thu Jul 16 20:58:50 2015 UTC,How so? That's like if you looked up Drogon when season 1 was being aired and got some Google results about who Drogon is that it would be one of Google's theories...
gameofthrones,3dibbj,grilsrgood,-1,Thu Jul 16 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"When I refer to it as a theory, I mean IF it's going to happen.  I'm not denying that cat is lsh"
gameofthrones,3dibbj,GarethGore,5,Thu Jul 16 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"Its too late for LSH in the show I think, though if the show has a big focus on Riverlands then maybe its possible? I can't see it though, it doesn't add too much in the grand scheme of things"
gameofthrones,3dibbj,bocboda,2,Thu Jul 16 21:12:40 2015 UTC,"How do you know?  It seems like something big could happen with her, Jaime, and Brienne in TWOW."
gameofthrones,3dibbj,JennyPretzel,6,Fri Jul 17 03:58:20 2015 UTC,"For some reason I believe they are going to give Catelyn's story to Jon via Melissandre. It is a huge longshot, but pretty often in TV they give a story of one character to another. Of course I suppose it would differ from the books a lot, but it's just a hunch. Anyways I would love some Lady Stoneheart, obviously."
gameofthrones,3dibbj,murukuta,3,Thu Jul 16 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, if we had LSH in season 4 and they do the same with Jon Snow, it would have lost the wow effect of the second."
gameofthrones,3dibbj,JennyPretzel,2,Fri Jul 17 09:18:04 2015 UTC,Exactly! And this would be a surprise for book readers as well.

gameofthrones,3dflmd,UnknownQTY,4,Thu Jul 16 03:42:40 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly why a lengthy stay would be odd. If he's there for a few months, that's going to be well beyond the usual amount of time that it'd take to film a scene like that."
gameofthrones,3dflmd,Quiddity99,33,Thu Jul 16 03:44:22 2015 UTC,"Who says they didn't just film his ""resurrection"" and a few choice scenes (his parts only) while they were filming on closed set last season?

gameofthrones,3dflmd,xshare,6,Thu Jul 16 03:30:34 2015 UTC,"wouldn't that just increase the probability of his resurrection leaking? if the same amount of people knew the information but had to keep it a secret for an even longer time?  and if they did do that, wouldn't that still mean that he's in limited scenes for season 6 just cause of the time constraints of having to film two seasons worth of material? less scenes = reveal later in the season."

gameofthrones,3dflmd,theboychinwonder,15,Thu Jul 16 09:00:06 2015 UTC,"I do not think that they can keep him off screen until very late in the season because there is a certain issue of... decomposition.  It varies but on average a decent length of time takes place between the start of a season and its end. I mean we had a good few months at least covered in season 5 since Brienne showed up outside Winterfell and iirc she spent 4 months watching for the signal from Sansa. Also in that time Jamie and Bronn went to Dorne, Jon dealt with the aftermath of the Wildling attack on the wall, then went to Hardhome then came back etc.  The books have shown that while you can bring someone back from the dead, if you leave it too long then they come back with whatever damage their body has taken in the mean time. Case in point LSH comes back looking less than great because the Frey's dumped her body in a river and she never got rezzed for something like a week and as a result her body took a fair bit of damage beyond the wounds she got at the wedding  Sure the Wall is pretty cold and that would help keep Jon ""fresh"" but the NW have a habit of burning peoples bodies these days so at the very least they need to pretty early on show maybe Davos, Edd, Mel etc. smuggling Jons body away from Castle Black at the very least if they intend to draw it out.  But by showing them smuggling his body away its going to basically confirm that hes coming back because why else would anybody bother doing that?  Personally i would just expect them to not try and hide it all that much, they have already let a decent number of major indications out into the wild without trying hard to cover them up...   Kit looks exactly like he should if he was still in the cast. re. hair and facial hair. The casting call for what everybody suspects to be Arthur Dayne ""an actor in his 30's/40's who is an unrivaled expert in wielding a sword for 1-2 weeks of combat shooting and who carries a famous sword"" The suspected Tower of Joy filming location leaked a few days ago, while some suspect it might be Casterly Rock it seems a little... solitary and almost completely fits the description of the Tower of Joy while Casterly would need major CGI work on a larger scale than what they already do with Kings Landing or Winterfell. (the only reason you would include Dayne and the Tower of Joy is if you were doing a flashback to Lyana Stark's death and Ned's promise, which everybody thinks is the whole R+L=J theory, which would be odd to do if Jon was dead and never coming back). Mel's actress basically blurted out in an interview at the end of season 5 that something big is going to happen between Mel and Jon Snow and that is why she suddenly showed up at Castle Black at the end of the season."
gameofthrones,3dflmd,DougyAM,12,Thu Jul 16 03:38:28 2015 UTC,Not to mention they included a show-only scene where Melisandre meets the BWB and specifically learns about resurrection in S3.

gameofthrones,3dflmd,rusty_blumpkin,16,Thu Jul 16 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they could easily film the funeral during the filming of season 5 and use the footage for season 6, right? If an actor or actress is killed off why would you bring them back a year later, to the filming location and spend all the money that entails when you could just film the funeral portion and save it for next year."
gameofthrones,3dflmd,saranowitz,6,Thu Jul 16 01:37:03 2015 UTC,Union rules make this kind of approach prohibitive.  Edit: wording

Case in point Michael Biehn got paid the same for Alien 3 as he did for Aliens because they used a still image of his face on a computer screen during a very small segment of Alien 3, he never had to show up and do filming or anything like that."
gameofthrones,3dflmd,toxicbrew,3,Thu Jul 16 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"Really--so say an episode or season that picks off right where the last one ended can't film any part of the new episode under the old director, same shooting days etc?

If he is literally not around for filming, that might indicate he is not present in this season... or that they can keep a secret. But even if he isn't around, it doesn't mean he won't return in the one after. In fact, one of the theories is that he'll skip a season."

gameofthrones,3dl5t2,Sethg119,2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:35 2015 UTC,They left out a key part that could have made it perfectly viable for him not to be around for awhile. So much so that it's barely a theory anymore. It's practically canon for many people rather than a hint of theory by this point.  His last book word wasn't included so gods know what the show plans to do.
gameofthrones,3dl5t2,TangentManDan,3,Fri Jul 17 06:45:35 2015 UTC,"The show is just going to cut out the middle man (Warging to Ghost and back again) as it saves time and it would be odd to suddenly spring on the viewers since they have only established that Brann can Warg out of the Starks on the TV show.  The books not being restrained to 10 hours in length have spent a lot more time establishing that Jon is a Warg and that he is more than likely going to fulfill Mel's vision of him ""becoming a wolf, and then a man again"".  So the show is just going to have Mel bring him back and save itself some time."

There's no way they could ever hope to maintain a secret that big, and that obvious, for long enough to be worthwhile (i.e. long enough to pull a 'gotcha' in the next season)."

gameofthrones,3dl5t2,jelliknight,-3,Fri Jul 17 07:19:26 2015 UTC,"They'd say ""maybe, wait til next season and find out!"" or they'd make some excuse for him being on set next season like being in flashbacks.   It'd be silly for them to say ""He's totally dead. Dead as dead can be. He's not coming back. His contract hasn't been renewed."" and then have him on the set a month later filming the next season. It's going to get out immediately and make them look stupid.  Style-wise Game of Thrones doesn't seem to use the cheesy old ""oh no he's dead! Just kidding, he's a main character."" trope that other shows do (that I can remember anyway, correct me if I'm wrong). I don't see what the point of it would be now. If you wanted to fake him dying you'd do it mid season and have the hint of him coming back in the season finale."

No they would not because that line is PR speak for ""absolutely he is alive, we just cant actually come out and say it"".  GoT and hundreds of other shows/books/movies have lied about characters and story arcs before and will lie about them again in the future.  Just because the cast or crew say one thing is does not in any stretch of the imagination mean anything concrete.   Style-wise Game of Thrones doesn't seem to use the cheesy old ""oh no he's dead! Just kidding, he's a main character."" trope that other shows do   Because GoT instead uses the trope of ""anybody who ever tries to do anything good in this world dies horribly"".  Jon coming back would break that Trope instead of just being example number 1245125 of a character trying to do something morally good in GoT and getting wrecked because of it.  You do not set him up as the direct counter part of the Night King (see Hardhome stare down) if you intend to kill him off.  You do not have one of only two living characters who can bring someone back from the dead abandon their previous ""champion"" only to conveniently show up exactly where Jon is the day he gets stabbed if you intend to do nothing with that.  You do not set up an entire back story teased over decades regarding Neds promise to Lyana and have characters comment on Neds story about Jon being full of shit (see Stannis saying Ned did not bed tavern whores) if you are not hinting at something.  You do not base your approval for the show even being made in the first place on them answering the question of ""who is Jon Snows mother?"" if its not an integral piece of the overall story.  You do not have other teases like Little Finger telling Sansa about her aunt this season, or Maester Aemon talking about ""there is nothing sadder than a lone Targaryen"" right as Jon Snow walks into the room on his own if you are not dropping sly hints about his parentage.  Lastly you do not have an actor who is under contract to keep his hair ""in character""... actually keep said hair in character 7+ months after he is supposedly finished with the show, hair that i might add the actor has said he hates and wishes he could cut. Photos from as little as last week show him to have the exact head and facial hair needed to play the part of Jon Snow still.  Not to mention GRRM laughing when someone asked him why he killed off Jon and then replying with ""so you think he is dead do you?"" followed by more laughing. Or setting up the first part of the latest book to explain how Wargs can live after death and then end that book on your main character warging. Or Mel's actress blurting out that ""something is going to happen"" between her and Jon Snow and that is why she showed up at Castle Black before season 5 ended.  Etc. etc. etc.  The show does not care about ""being made to look silly"" by saying one thing and then doing another, they have done it in the past and nobody has cared about it then."

gameofthrones,3dikcq,LtColStaghorn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:36:25 2015 UTC,"You are aware how much development work goes into having an actual choice, yes?  Say you have a story that's, oh, let's go with 50,000 words - standard NaNoWriMo length. This, of course, doesn't quite translate into a movie or game but those also have stories and words spoken and things that happen so it's close enough of an example for our purposes, and I'm more familiar with how this works with written stories regardless.  Now, let's say that you have a single choice to be made, right at the halfway point - a simple, A or B choice, but one that doesn't weave directly back into the opposite choice. So, you have 25,000 words before the choice, but afterwards you have 25,000 words for choice A and 25,000 for choice B - you've just multiplied the amount of words that you need to write by a factor of 1.5, and you still need to make sure that both paths have good pacing, a satisfying climax, et cetera. Add another, say at 10,000 words, and - assuming you retain the latter choice in both paths - you're up to 140,000 words - with only two choices to make of two options each. So as you can see, the workload for the writer increases dramatically with each choice made.  Now, this applies differently to a game like this, of course. Dialogue certainly gets doubled - and keep in mind that each dialogue in this game is essentially multiplied by four due to the way options work, not to mention that it's all voice acted, sometimes by big names with equally-large (presumably) expenses. If a character, say, gets a major scar in one path and not in the other, the graphic designers are going to need to create two textures for a character - hell, this applies even if they wear different clothes. And if you end up in a different location at all, that's more characters to design, model, texture, and voice. Each scene is going to need to be ""directed"", and you'll probably want a different score if the tone of a scene is significantly different then the corresponding scene in the other path. So really, a lot more time and money is going into having large-scale decisions in a game like this than in an ordinary story.  I hope you can see at this point why having choices that eventually lead to the same path is a more realistic option than having choices that are completely diversionary."
gameofthrones,3dikcq,Kalde22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is more complicated, it takes much more time and money. More realistic to make a simpler game ? Of course. More satisfying for players ? Not much sadly."

They simply had one story, no optional paths, and they were good at it. Giving the illusion of choices and consequences when there is hardly any of it (it's all already written), disappoints me on the other hand. Or at least they give you a sense consequences about small choices, your choices, from time to time, I feel like Life is Strange is a much better game on that matter for instance, my choices there felt more ""meaningful""."

In order to write something ten years ago that foretells something in the conclusion - you have to have a plan about how the story ends.  GRRM is not making this up as he goes.  He is part of the creative team of the show and has written episodes in the past (now he is trying to finish the books).  When the show began he gave an outline of books six and seven to the creative team at HBO - they know where the story is going.  GRRM has said consistently that he is not changing the story to respond to fan theories like those on Reddit.  The show runners are saying they will tell the story they have to tell in seven seasons.  The show and the books have diverged.  Some of the divergence is related trying to capture many of the plot lines from the books that happen to the many, many characters that they don't have time for in the show.  So some of these plot lines are given to characters that the audience is already familiar with.   Both the TV show and the novels are GRRM's work."

gameofthrones,3dlc1l,Sethg119,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:27:58 2015 UTC,"Even if the Book and the Series deviate from one another, they will end up at the same place. There will definitely be more plot twists and turns in the books than there will be on screen because books don't have limited budgets. Certain story aspects from the books will be diverted from their intended characters and re-purposed in existing ones. Lady Stone Heart is a prime example of this. She seems to have a integral role to play within the books for TWOW, however, on the show she has not been revealed. This could be a strategic move by D&D as to not over saturate resurrection so that it has more impact when it occurs."

I get this gnawing feeling that GRRM is going to make the end of his books different. That he is going to save the ""good"" ending for himself, leaving the show with a lesser ending.   D&D have full creative control. GRRM can't force them to take anything lesser. Also, read this:   There have been differences between the novels and the television show since the first episode of season one. And for just as long, I have been talking about the butterfly effect. Small changes lead to larger changes lead to huge changes. HBO is more than forty hours into the impossible and demanding task of adapting my lengthy (extremely) and complex (exceedingly) novels, with their layers of plots and subplots, their twists and contradictions and unreliable narrators, viewpoint shifts and ambiguities, and a cast of characters in the hundreds.   There has seldom been any TV series as faithful to its source material, by and large (if you doubt that, talk to the Harry Dresden fans, or readers of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, or the fans of the original WALKING DEAD comic books)... but the longer the show goes on, the bigger the butterflies become. And now we have reached the point where the beat of butterfly wings is stirring up storms, like the one presently engulfing my email.   Prose and television have different strengths, different weaknesses, different requirements.   David and Dan and Bryan and HBO are trying to make the best television series that they can.  And over here I am trying to write the best novels that I can.   http://grrm.livejournal.com/427713.html"

gameofthrones,3djhkw,Incursus,45,Fri Jul 17 01:17:24 2015 UTC,Kit Harrington. Hardhome was his best episode.
gameofthrones,3djhkw,Cinephile_Chris,15,Fri Jul 17 17:50:12 2015 UTC,Can't agree with this more.  This episode was easily the best of the season IMHO.

gameofthrones,3djhkw,ProCarbonz,11,Fri Jul 17 00:35:43 2015 UTC,"Big fan of Lena Headey this season, her acting really portrays how much of a nutter Cersei is."
gameofthrones,3djhkw,HahUCLA,11,Thu Jul 16 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"My top 5 choices :  1) Lena Heady as Cersei: This was her season to shine, and boy did she nail it. She portrayed the bitchy, vain, selfish, crazy side as well as the emotional, maternal side as well with a subtlety few actors have. Standout scenes were, when she's conversing with Tommen, her change in expression at being accosted by the Sparrows, and of course the Walk of Penance which was a masterclass, showing her defiance slowly break, making even her biggest haters feel sympathy for her.  2) Kit Harrington as Jon Snow: This guy has improved by leaps and bounds since season 3 and he was perfect in his role. Whether its portraying his constant internal struggle, or fantastic fighting skills, he was fucking mint throughout!  3) Alfie Allen as Reek/Theon: Although I feel Alfie's best performance was in S02 he really imbibed the character & personality of Reek like a boss. His twitchy body language, and expressive eyes really conveyed the pain and helplessness of Reek and the final break towards the end where he decides to save Sansa was a great fuck-yeah moment.  4) Ian Glen as Jorah Mormont: Iain as Jorah has been fantastic in every single scene. His eyes & facial expressions are perfect and his portrayal as the flawed, stubborn, love-struck, unimaginably loyal and faithful counterpart was on-point. Also his chemistry with the Dinkles was the icing on the cake.  5) Bridgett Sorensen as Karsi, the wildling chieftainess: It really speaks volumes about the writing, acting and direction of an episode when a character becomes a fan-favourite in just 20 minutes of screentime. She was the Asha Greyjoy the show never had. (Screw you Yara you imposter). She was brave, funny, level-headed, empathetic, smart enough to look past prejudices and a kickass fighter. Her death by the wight kids was harrowing yet poetic, since these were kids she probably knew and realised she had failed to save. Also, that little neck twist and blink she does after becoming a wight was so fucking creepy. Props to her."
gameofthrones,3djhkw,Cryptorchild92,0,Thu Jul 16 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"While I guess I liked Karsi as a character and the acting was done well, I find her character to be unrealistic. Like you said, she came off as tolerant and seemed almost educated, which are not qualities I would associate with the wildings. Just think about our case studies: The Thenns, who we saw to be bloodthirsty dickheads. The Lord of Bones, unsophisticated, again a dickhead and not the most intelligent character. Moving on to more likeable wildlings, we have Tormund, who, while a kinder character, was not well spoken or seemingly educated like Karsi. Ygritte was like Tormund in those regards. But yeah, essentially I just found the character to be a bit weird and unfitting."
gameofthrones,3djhkw,Cryinghyena,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:18:47 2015 UTC,"It's a little more true to the books that way, actually. The Free Folk are a lot more diverse than a band of savages. There's a guy who boasts about being descended from a great King Beyond the Wall and likes to talk about how civilized and reasonable he is, there are some who join the Night's Watch, and Mance himself blends into Westerosi society perfectly. The show generally portrays them as two groups: the savages, and the cannibal savages, where in the books they are a huge society with many different clans and all sorts of people, from quality leaders like Karsi down to those very cannibal savages who refuse to work with anyone. I only wish this portrayal of the wildlings was around since season 2, at least."

gameofthrones,3douhg,Banana11crazy,11,Sun Jul 19 13:45:30 2015 UTC,Actually he would. I'd like to point you to Maester Aemon's funeral where he was burned with ease. Targs are NOT immune to fire. They are merely a bit more resistant to heat than the average person (Danys hands weren't scalded when she took the dragon eggs from fire but the girl saving her had her hands burned easily). The thing with the pyre and Dany walking into it was a one time magical event fueled by blood magic (the witch's doing) which is why she wasn't killed.

Home video and TV channels that reran movies weren't much of a thing back then. If you didn't see it in the theater you just didn't see it period.

Of course there were plenty of dicks, Jon Snow spoilers, Jurassic World spoilers and pretty much spoilers for anything.   It's too easy for information to reach us, and too many assholes who can give it to us. You are fucked for spoilers unless you are up to date on a show.

gameofthrones,3dkhyv,it-was-taken,5,Fri Jul 17 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. For the most part, I think it is to show the person's POV the story is following. Dany, the POV character, doesn't understand Dothraki, but Jorah, who isn't a POV, does and provides the translation for her. When Dany is in Yunkai getting the Unsullied, we see the subtitles even though Missandei provides a translation, because Dany knows and understands Valyrian.  There are some examples that don't follow this though. One time I can think of is in Hardhome when the Giant says, ""the fuck you looking at?"" to Edd."

gameofthrones,3dil6s,vbm923,4,Thu Jul 16 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"I've seen some interesting and compelling stuff on youtube about Jon Snow's parentage, that Eddard Stark is most likely not the father and that he is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. The one huge and obvious problem I have with this is the color of his hair which looks more like Baratheon hair than Targaryen hair. When Ned Stark was investigating Cersei's infidelity the fact that Baratheon hair is always dark is a major plot point."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,Goldcobra,3,Thu Jul 16 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"The Targaryen traits are very very recessive, that's the reason they usually marry their siblings, to keep their Dragonblood pure. In history there have been a few Targs with brown hair or non-purple eyes, mostly bastards with non-Targs or in later Generations when they intermarried with the Martells to include Dorne into the Seven Kingdoms.   Roberts's father also had black hair and he had a Targaryen mother. It's not real world genetics but generally the brighter hair colours lose to the darker ones more often than not and Baratheon black apparently always wins.    Concerning show divergencies with hair colour: if you compare Season 1 Tyrion and Jaime with their later Seasons counterparts, they just don't bother with bleaching their hairs so pronounced anymore as it looked kinda weird and was only a plot point in the first season. People with wigs like Cersei or Dany still have the proper hair colour. Also look at show Shireen's hair, that's completely against the point of Baratheon black always winning."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,bentom08,4,Thu Jul 16 20:40:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with my own theory here, that Jon Snow is actually Dornish and that his real parents are Rhaegar and Elia Martell. That the Mountain killed another baby that was substituted and that Jon Snow would actually have more of a claim as heir to House Targaryen than Danaerys would. The manner in which Lyanna died does seem to imply that she is the mother, but that could always be explained away as something else. It will be interesting to see how he reveals this in the story.  edit: of course I'm not sure the timeline is right for this, Jon Snow is fourteen at the beginning of the story and Robert's rebellion happened fifteen years before."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,Shutupredneckman2,2,Thu Jul 16 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"While the timing might work it wouldn't make sense for Lyanna to care so much about Rhaegar child, or for Ned to go to such lengths to protect him?  But more importantly, Jon obviously has some Stark blood. That's how he's a warg, and how just about everyone he meets can recognize that he is related to Ned. In the books Arya and Jon are the only Stark children to look like Starks, so obviously one of his parents were a Stark."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,Sotajarocho,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm going to have to take back my theory, I'm re-reading the first book and there was a lot in there about how much he looked like Ned Stark. Interesting that when Tyrion first met him his comment was that he had more of the North in him than his brothers."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,runmelos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:44:41 2015 UTC,"of course I'm not sure the timeline is right for this, Jon Snow is fourteen at the beginning of the story and Robert's rebellion happened fifteen years before.   Timewise it would work if she had him right after Aegon. It's also in line with Jon's lack of Targaryen traits but he'd then probably have more Dornish features like Rhaenys (black hair instead of brown and olive skin).  Most people I know that wanna see Jon on the Iron Throne usually just say that Rhaegar married Lyanna as well (Targaryen style), that would also put Jon before Dany in terms of succession.    Other possibility would obviously be that Dany well.. dies. Somewhere in the books it's implied that bastards can inherit if there's no other legitimate heir left. I like that, wouldn't be a song of ice and fire without Jon and Dany fighting to the death, haha.   But my favorite contender for the throne would be Tyrion, simply because he was hated all his life and I've never seen a dwarf become king before."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,MrPeltz,2,Fri Jul 17 00:06:22 2015 UTC,I'm re-reading the first book and I forgot how much was in there about how much he looked like Ned. And the warg thing implies he has Stark blood. Tyrion's comment when he first met him was that he had more of the North in him than his brothers. All this would imply that Lyanna is the mother although there was something in the book about Ser Arthur Dayne's sister Ashara being a likely candidate.
gameofthrones,3dil6s,StraightToThePoint1,2,Fri Jul 17 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a casting thing.  In the books, Jon is described as having brown hair and grey eyes which are very Stark features."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,MrPeltz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:30 2015 UTC,"That makes more sense, but still Targaryen hair is very obvious, almost a bleached blond look. It's just surprising to me that the color of hair is a plot point for ID'ing Robert Baratheon's bastard's but isn't considered anywhere else."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,Rawr_Love_1824,5,Thu Jul 16 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to these comments, Targaryen hair is only white when they have babies with other Targaryens. When they have a baby with someone else it can be whatever color, usually the color of the other parent."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,StraightToThePoint1,3,Thu Jul 16 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"In most cases, the dark haircolor takes over.  I would think this is especially the case with almost white hair.  In your example about Baratheons, Joff's light hair was odd because of Roberts dark hair always takes over.  Similarly, it would be shocking for Jon's hair to be light when Starks have dark hair."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,Goldcobra,4,Thu Jul 16 19:55:47 2015 UTC,To back this up: the whole reason why the Targaryens married brother to sister is to preserve those recessive Targaryen features.
gameofthrones,3dil6s,Cryinghyena,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:10 2015 UTC,"Well in the books, Ned doesn't just look at the hair colour of baratheons, he looks at every marriage between lannister and baratheon recorded and finds out baratheon black has won out over lannister gold every time. Hence ""the seed is strong"". So it's more to do with the baratheon hair colour genes being stronger than the lannister ones. The targaryen hair colour genes are fairly weak, the only reason silver haired targs still exist is because they interbreed so much."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,tmhawk83,2,Thu Jul 16 21:46:28 2015 UTC,It's basically the same way with Starks. Lyanna's dark hair gene would be more dominant than Rhaegar's silver hair gene.

gameofthrones,3dil6s,corgistump,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"Officialy it would be Tommen but if it's found out that he's a bastard it would default to some (Lomas?) Estermont, Stannis's uncle, who's (in the books at least) currently defending the castle against the Tyrell's. Stannis & co's mother was an Estermont and since the Baratheons are officially extinct (unless some bastard gets legitimized) it would fall to the Estermonts.   But in the end I guess the king has the final word and can give it to whoever he wants (there's no Baratheons left to revolt and the Estermonts are too weak)"
gameofthrones,3dil6s,vbm923,0,Thu Jul 16 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"Tommen is the lord of Storm's End at the moment. If Tommen died, the Hand would take over and they would have a council to decide the closest heir. It's happened once before in the history of Westeros."

He found the knight, saw that it was Lyanna, and then lied to Aerys by saying that he didn't catch the knight and only found their shield or something.  I'm leaving out a lot of details, but that's the general idea."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,emperor000,-7,Thu Jul 16 19:21:55 2015 UTC,"Rhaegar Targeryen... He secretly funded the tourney to get Lyanna Stark there. This is because he was obessed with the ""prince who was promised"" prophecy and thought he needed to carry it out."

gameofthrones,3dil6s,Rawr_Love_1824,-2,Thu Jul 16 18:52:07 2015 UTC,I got confused with that part of the story. I had thought Rhaegar was the Knight of the Laughing Tree and then unveiled himself at the end to give Lyanna the flowers. Apologies.
gameofthrones,3dil6s,jelliknight,2,Thu Jul 16 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"If the theories regarding Jon Snow's parentage are true and if he does get resurrected, why would anyone believe and support Jon Snow if he tries to take back the North or even put a claim on the iron throne?  Does it rest entirely on Howland Reed since he is the only one alive who knows what happened in the Tower of Joy?"
gameofthrones,3dil6s,vbm923,3,Fri Jul 17 00:53:04 2015 UTC,"Howleed Reed, yes.  There are lots of other theories that there is some kind of proof hidden in the crypts of winterfell (rheagars harp perhaps).  ALSO, Rob legitimatized Jon before dying so if that decree is being kept safe somewhere, he could easily take winterfell.  Plus, his parentage might not lead to his taking any kind of crown or throne.  It could simply help him lead the fight against the white walkers either as a dragon rider due to his targ blood or warging due to stark blood or a combination."
gameofthrones,3dil6s,vbm923,2,Fri Jul 17 14:50:42 2015 UTC,The North remembers. For the entirety of the Norther existence the Starks have been the Wardens. If Jon Snow desired he could try and lay claim to Winterfell because he would basically be the last Stark male that is known of (unless Rickon appears.) I don't think he will necessarily do this if he comes back. The White Walkers are a huge threat to him so he would focus on that.
gameofthrones,3dil6s,MrPeltz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:07:39 2015 UTC,So he would be a Stark instead of just a bastard and possibly gain support of the North.  But why would people believe he is part Targaryen if Jon Snow finds out about this (if the theory is true)?
gameofthrones,3dil6s,MrPeltz,0,Fri Jul 17 01:25:53 2015 UTC,There's really no way for him to have everyone believe that he would be Targeryn if he is. He could find conclusive evidence that he is and people could still deny it.

Those are the only two that I believe are real and actually are playing MAJOR roles in what is happening in Westeros and Essos. The War of the Dawn is based around these two forces fighting. The warlocks of Qarth are the Great Other's minions and the Red Priests are R'hllor's minions

But I agree with emperor000 - blood magic doesn't mean there's a god.  Skinchanging and warging are pretty powerful and magical things that have nothing to do with Rhllor.  Qyburn also has nothing to do with rhllor.  Greenseers can also see the future without Rhllor.

Rigidly. When he wants to sacrifice Edric Storm (his nephew that he has never met and has zero love for) he is certain his death will literally save tens of thousands and that's obviously an easy trade. <what is the life of one bastard boy?...against a kingdom.  Now it comes to his own daughter. In Staniss' mind it's the same trade off. 1 girl for a whole kingdom. If he changes his code just because it's HIS daughter, and it would be a genuine sacrifice then he's a total hypocrite.  He's a fully fledged believer and he is certain he absolutely has to act like he does but because it has been prophesied. No ifs and buts or half measures.

Even though Melisandre repeatedly told him that he was the Lord's chosen he never really seemed to truly believe it, just that he was the rightful king.   Also Stannis took too long to leave Castle Black. After saving Castle Black he shouldn't have stayed more than a couple of days before leaving to attack Winterfell. And once he decided to leave it was too late, and yet he continued to march forward even when it was obvious that he was going to fail. Stannis was supposed to be a great military commander and yet he wasn't acting like it. He risked everything when it wasn't wise to."

I feel like it does poor justice to the Stannis in the books, who I still firmly like and stand behind, cause I don't think Shireen dies the way the show decided to kill her. I see the whole affair with him in the last two episodes as a blunder, and just kinda resent what it's done. Heck, even if they were changing the book story, it could've been a genuinely good tragedy, but I just think the turn from loving father to unmoved pyromaniac came too quick and without enough time for us to at least kind of get on board and see both sides, rather than getting so polarized."

His reasons and justifications and the comparisons to acts that other characters have committed are just semantics when you get right down to it, because even if you can sympathize that he was trying to save the world and he sacrificed his daughter so he could fulfill prophecies or whatnot, you can't really get around 'the dude kills his children'.   And then, we aren't ""supposed"" to root for one character to triumph from beginning to end. This isn't that kind of story, and these aren't that kind of characters.

Stannis himself seems skeptical in the beginning. And Melisandre having powers is no proof that...   ...her powers really come from R'hllor, and aren't just some kind of blood magic that works in an impersonal way (She's described in the books as a Shadowbinder trained in Asshai, her smoke baby powers seems related to that, and possibly other powers as well, and I don't think all Shadowbinders are Red Priests. Quaithe is also a Shadowbinder, but doesn't seem to be a Red Priestess or have anything to do with them, that we know of.) ...that R'hllor even exists, or exists as a deity with a personality and intentions, (I think R'hllor is just an aspect of the Many-Faced God, Death, which is an impersonal force that people can gain magic power from through sacrifice, that is blood magic. There's a moral side to it only in that the form of sacrifice - sacrificial murder or self-sacrifice - might determine the effects. At least that's my theory about it.) ...that R'hllor is a force for good if he/she/it does exist.   It would be like if someone in real life demonstrated telekinetic powers. It would certainly be proof that there are phenomena our current understanding of nature can't account for, but it would be a mistake to then take that as proof that religion X is true. Uneducated and credulous people might take it that way, but an intelligent educated person who hoped to be a leader shouldn't."

Again, he has no real evidence for any of this. And what we do have is good evidence that kinslaying is considered a huge crime and a huge stain, which pretty much guarantees many of his men would abandon him (as they did) and much of the realm would probably never kneel to him no matter what. Stannis was just a poor leader. He was a soldier, not a political leader. He didn't understand people, and tried to compensate for his poor political skills by being ruthless and making human sacrifices to a god that may or may not even exist, and may not even be a force for good (I don't think a god who demands human sacrifices could ever be a force for good), ultimately sacrificing his own innocent daughter (and only real heir for his whole dynasty). He was never heroic or fit to be king."

As it turned out it backfired, since half his men with the horses deserted because they didn't want to fight for a kinslayer. If he was a good leader he should have anticipated that. But he didn't. He made a utilitarian calculation, but like most ""strong"" leaders who make such calculations, he overestimated his knowledge and the predictability of the consequences (he missed what Donald Rumsfeld infamously called ""unknown unknowns"" - his excuse for the consequences of a similarly mistaken utilitarian calculation that turned out horribly), and was biased towards the option he wanted to take. He wasn't biased because he was cruel or hated his daughter, but because he wanted to believe he was Azor Ahai and his pride and ambition wouldn't let him doubt it or doubt Melisandre's predictions."

And Melisandre believed everything she said. She was truly horrified by how things turned out, as we saw. You might argue that perhaps R'hllor is manipulating everyone, but that seems like a cop-out. Stannis has to mannis up about his mistakes (and so does Melisandre)."

gameofthrones,3ditam,hlainelarkinmk2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:02:43 2015 UTC,"No. They said George told them to do that. Which firstly could be that they're lying, secondly could be that he only told them to do it in the show.  Thirdly, it does happen in the book, but under a completely different context. And the context is extremely important.   Plus since we have all the evidence of D&Ds misunderstanding/butchery of Stannis in seasons before, it's pretty safe to assume they manipulated events once again."
gameofthrones,3ditam,hlainelarkinmk2,3,Fri Jul 17 07:26:14 2015 UTC,"they're just weak minded peasants, long live the mannis, what is dead may never die!!"
gameofthrones,3ditam,hlainelarkinmk2,2,Thu Jul 16 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"If he had showed any sign of regret for Shireen, he would still (probably) be adored"
gameofthrones,3ditam,hlainelarkinmk2,11,Thu Jul 16 16:53:33 2015 UTC,"I thought the regret was extremely clear. He was a broken man, and Stephen Dillane perfectly captured that. The morning after, once the adrenalin had worn off, he instantly realised he had done the worst thing he could ever do. And as everything else stated to go wrong, it was quite clear that he just didn't care anymore. He'd lost all feeling and even during the 'siege', he didn't even bother commanding his men into formation, he just gave in to the bloodbath and hoped he would die fast. He clearly felt more regret than any man could bear."
gameofthrones,3ditam,hlainelarkinmk2,2,Thu Jul 16 16:59:37 2015 UTC,It is his fault. He didn't have to ever burn his daughter but he valued his pride more than Shireen and wouldn't retreat to Castle Black even though that was the more prudent manoeuver
gameofthrones,3ditam,psychic01,0,Thu Jul 16 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"He valued his pride because he was told he was the hero of the story. He was brainwashed into thinking he genuinely could do no wrong. He didn't want to be forgotten again (trapped at Castle Black) like after Robert's Rebellion. He made one colossal error, but I blame Melisandre and blame Stannis only enough for his end to not be utterly tragic (instead just upsetting)."
gameofthrones,3ditam,fadhero,8,Thu Jul 16 16:52:22 2015 UTC,Everybody thinks they are the hero of their own story. He is supposed to be a military genius yet everything he did since defeating Mance has been incompetent (lots of errors not just the one). And how would you say he was forgotten after the rebellion exactly?
gameofthrones,3ditam,ANukeGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 16:57:25 2015 UTC,"He was sent off to Dragonstone and was shunned as the heir to the Throne because he wasn't around. He was forgotten by almost everyone after the Rebellion, and didn't even get a role in the books until he tried to start a war. He was a lonely man, and was clearly determined never to be forgotten again. Yes he messed up, but I think his clearly broken soul shows quite clearly that he has suffered enough for it. I felt sorry for him at the end, and was not cheering.  Also he was a military genius yes. But he lost the Battle of Winterfell because he no longer cared. He wasn't trying anymore, and that's why he lost. He was welcoming death. What other errors did he make? It was his men who failed to stop Ramsay (in deep snow, a territory they are not used to, while Ramsay's 20 Good Men were)."
gameofthrones,3ditam,fluintApp,5,Thu Jul 16 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"He wasn't shunned as heir because he was in dragonstone, he wasn't technically in line because without proof of Cercei's children being bastards Tommen &Joffrey are ahead of him in succession. Other errors include ignoring Ser Davos, wildly misunderstanding Wildling culture, burning Mance as well as not retreating in the face of overwhelming odds"
gameofthrones,3ditam,laughland,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"How the hell was he supposed to know about Wildlings culture? He's a southern lord who wandered North, and what a lot of people forget is that knowledge is not omnipotent in the Game of Thrones universe.   He executed Mance because he was a stubborn king who wouldn't go back on his word. Also he had faith in The Lord of Light, because R'hllor had not yet failed him.  He didn't retreat because he was broken and he no longer cared. He was going to keep fighting, just in case R'hllor's betrayal of him wasn't set in stone, but at that point he had realised he had gone too far and was ready to give in and let death take him."
gameofthrones,3ditam,FreakyCheeseMan,6,Thu Jul 16 17:22:30 2015 UTC,He had Jon Snow telling him the whole time if you do this the wildlings will hate you & never bend the knee. If he was truely broken as you keep claiming he would have never kept pressing on to Winterfell and would actually given up not kept pressing the issue. His stubborness is pretty stupid and he really wasn't faithful at all in R'Hollr (I've said the words damn you: he doesn't understand there's more to faith than just saying the right things in prayer)
gameofthrones,3ditam,YoYoSun,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:29:14 2015 UTC,"He thought he was destined to win. At that point he had lost everything, and decided that if he was going to die, he would do it trying to prevent his mistakes from being in vain.   Also he was an idiot for believing that much in The Lord of Light, but if we hated every idiot on this show there would be scarce few heroes left.  SIDENOTE: Could you please stop downvoting everything I say? It's not exactly an ego-boost. Disagreeing with someone is not a fair constitution for downvoting."
gameofthrones,3ditam,runmelos,3,Thu Jul 16 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"If he wanted his actions to not be in vain he would have retreated, his entire schtick is he wants to be King & having just killed his only heir commiting suicide by hopeless battle is only going to be in vain. And part of GoT's thing is there are no heroes, only shades of grey"
gameofthrones,3ditam,FreakyCheeseMan,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"Stannis is a dark grey character. That is undeniable. But he is not a villain.   As for not retreating, you keep ignoring the fact that he didn't care anymore. He had no ambition and just wanted to finish what he had started. He thought there might have been a chance that the sacrifice may have paid off, until he saw Roose's army approaching. At that point there was no escape and he decided to just go out fighting."
gameofthrones,3ditam,Skunkmulder,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:12:28 2015 UTC,I gotta say no on that. Stannis is stern and although Shireen died him letting 1000+ men die isn't him. He also had other commanders in his army that did nothing to put the soldiers in strategic positioning.
gameofthrones,3ditam,TheThingMaker,2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:44 2015 UTC,"No man is so accursed as the kinslayer.   In the show, he killed his daughter in a last ditch effort to make himself king. It wasn't about honor or duty. It was about pride and glory and desire. It wasn't even necessarily out of a bonafide religious belief; even his true believer wife wanted to stop it. He loved his daughter, but threw her away for his own benefit. Not exactly what you want to see in a parent or a king."
gameofthrones,3ditam,DerrickIsCool,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"That is exactly why it was so evil, he succumbed to ""the ends justify the means"". Nobody can predict the future. And when you start pretending you can, atrocities occur. The greatest atrocities in human history all came about because evil men (who never thought they were evil) believed in ""the ends justify the means"". Stannis was the same. It is hard to see much of a difference in his evil than that of Mao, Spanish conquistadors, Southern slaveholders, etc. He gets a pass from some because his talk of 'duty' is inspiring. But his massive crimes had nothing to do with duty. And murdering his daughter ""for the greater good"" is just different in magnitude from Pol Pot murdering intellectuals ""for the greater good""."
gameofthrones,3ditam,Shireenisaphoenix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone ever saw Stannis for a villain. Perhaps he was blinded by greed and ""justice"" but really if you look at it he just wanted to keep his legacy alive. As far burning his daughter at the stake, I don't know why he thought sacrificing his own blood for glory made sense, but he made a mistake.   He was still a brilliant commander and leader nonetheless. It's a shame that he made such a drastic decision but we see that a lot in Game of Thrones, so we can't be too surprised I guess"
gameofthrones,3ditam,DerrickIsCool,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest there's very few characters in the show I can bring myself to hate. Most of them have back stories that don't justify what they've done, but does explain it. I feel most of them are tragic figures, not villains. Stannis included."
gameofthrones,3dkcwo,Banana11crazy,13,Thu Jul 16 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine since every time we have seen a WW death so far they have exploded into ice dust, probably not."
gameofthrones,3dkcwo,deadnugent,5,Thu Jul 16 23:44:05 2015 UTC,Please remember that White Walkers and wights are different things.  White Walkers are the ice-demony things that Sam and Jon killed.  Wights are the reanimated dead that they control.  White Walkers are not dead and have not come back to life.
gameofthrones,3dkcwo,komacki,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"Didn't know there was a difference between them either, sorry for that. I meant the wights then."
gameofthrones,3dkcwo,komacki,8,Thu Jul 16 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"No problem.  Wights (whether the freshly-reanimated zombie-looking ones or the more decayed skeletal-looking ones) can only be permanently killed by fire, though if they are smashed to pieces (say by a giant stepping on them) that seems to work well enough.  They CAN be incapacitated for a short while by damage from normal weapons but then they get right back up.  An example of that is the one that Jon saved Commander Mormont from in season 1.  So it seems that the best strategy for fighting them is to light them on fire as fast as possible, but if that's not an option then do enough damage to them to temporarily KO them and either smash them up or quickly light them on fire while they're down.  edit, tl;dr - Forgot to actually answer your original question.  No, the White Walkers don't resurrect wights multiple times because the wights don't actually ""die"" from normal damage.  They get up on their own until fire is used to permanently destroy them."
gameofthrones,3dkcwo,therapy,3,Fri Jul 17 00:04:24 2015 UTC,Ok thanks for the answer. They also 'stay alive' when they jump down from that cliff when Jon is looking at them.
gameofthrones,3dkcwo,Kresslia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"If you mean the wights, then I'm not sure what ""resurrected"" means. To keep fighting after they are broken into pieces? They seem to not do that, once shattered or burned, they just ""stop"". We have not seen a Walker make a shattered or burned wight return into fighting mode, that seems like the end of the road for them.  But, that is all we know for now. It might be incomplete."
gameofthrones,3dkcwo,slayerofkin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:02:35 2015 UTC,Resurrected is bringing back to life. Also I mistook the Wights for White Walkers. The White Walkers are the ice-looking guys that get shattered. The Wights are just the skeletons.

gameofthrones,3dkaut,theboychinwonder,6,Thu Jul 16 23:24:01 2015 UTC,"I think Jaime is the valonqar.  They're twins but Jaime was born after. He's the only man in all Westeros who could get close enough to her to strangle her. When her kids -- his kids -- will all die, he's gonna lose it. He has one hand technically, but that should suffice to asphyxiate a confused drama queen. Or they might just for the full David Carradine treatment with him manning the ropes, since last time their son died it got steamy."
gameofthrones,3dkaut,jo_maka,12,Thu Jul 16 23:55:09 2015 UTC,"That makes the most sense to me as well. I made a thread about who's valonqar not so long ago, and one person said something that made a lot of sense to me. You see, Cersei was born first and then Jaime, moments later, clutching her heel. Now recently he lost a hand, and she might lose a foot to infection from the walk of shame she had, and that would technically sever the tie they have had from birth. Really poetic if you ask me."
gameofthrones,3dkaut,CrvenaPanda,2,Fri Jul 17 00:06:23 2015 UTC,Would explain why Jaime will always throw himself at her feet to accomplish her every whims. She also got upset somewhat at Jaime for coming back without his hand.

You kind of have to assume Maggy was telling the truth and not trying to be slippery with weasel words and saying events out of order, because if you assume she was lying to make things sound worse than they are then there's no reason to believe the prophesy at all.   Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you.    We know this one, Bobby's a playa   Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, she said.    All blonde and all going to die.   And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.   It's sort of implied that this is after the kids are all dead. It's the 'pale white throat' that gets me. Cersie is fair but not notably so, why would her skin be white and pale? Unless she's very sick. 'When your tears have drowned you' could almost be literal - i.e. when your sadness lead to kill yourself. It's possible that she loses the will to live after her last child dies and Jamie/Tryion finishes her off with a mercy killing."

Pay close attention to prophecies and religious fanatics - try and figure out if they're right or wrong, are the Gods real or not. Also it's POV chapters, what people are seeing and saying is from their perspective which can skew things - Sansa is the most obvious. Don't always take things at face value, if something seems off in their description of events see if you can figure out what is actually going on.   Last of all, enjoy!"

gameofthrones,3die32,localhost87,18,Thu Jul 16 14:54:59 2015 UTC,I don't believe so. He technically would have no claim to the throne and obviously that's a big deal to people in Westeros so by their laws he would not he King even for that little amount of time. And Jaime's Kingsguard vows make it so that he can not be a lord.
gameofthrones,3die32,Knowing_Nothing,3,Thu Jul 16 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"Does it matter what the people believe makes a powerful king? Versus what the Lord of light considers to be powerful.  I mean, a Bastard with Kings blood was still pretty powerful."

gameofthrones,3die32,EvilCatGod,8,Sat Jul 18 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"He was a member of the Kingsguard and thus wouldn't be able to take the throne even if he wanted to.   Also with regards to the whole King's blood debate going on, I personally believe that this King's Blood is actually just Targaryean blood. The Targaryean's have ruled the Seven Kingdoms for hundreds of years  (From 1 AD up until Robert's Rebellion in 281 BC). As Robert's family tied into the Targaryean family line due to a marriages a few generations before, many of the living Baratheons are part Targaryean (Robert's claim for his rebellion) and the reason why Melisandre is able to use the blood of Robert's bastards (Gendry) for her blood magic shenanigans.   TLDR: Kingsguard can't be kings. Kings blood may be Targaryean blood"
gameofthrones,3die32,LongShotTheory,5,Thu Jul 16 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"Well half of westeros probably has targaryen blood in that case. Marriage pacts for almost 300 years is bound to spread the targaryen blood. they only wed one sister to brother, the other younger children who wouldn't succeed their father on the throne would be married off to other houses."

gameofthrones,3die32,DeathFeind,3,Thu Jul 16 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"The throne is not musical chairs, if you want a specific moment it's when the High Septon crowns the king. Agon the conqueror and Robert were both crowned this way. That's when they offically become king."
gameofthrones,3die32,merhandus,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:11 2015 UTC,I don't even think Joffrey or Tommen even qualify as having kings blood. It's all about rightful heirs.
gameofthrones,3die32,gbondura,3,Thu Jul 16 19:45:02 2015 UTC,Jaime couldve been king by conquest or Nedd but Robert claimed it by birth right since his grandmother was targeryn.

gameofthrones,3dfqkl,scoutmastersteve,96,Wed Jul 15 22:33:29 2015 UTC,The show is incredibly vague and inconsistent on Kingsguard who aren't main characters. They're basically used as props or background ornamentation.
gameofthrones,3dfqkl,dongazine_supplies,26,Wed Jul 15 23:02:55 2015 UTC,Indeed. Have the others besides Trant and Jaime even been referred to by name on the show? Without Trant and zombie Gregor they are all generic now.
gameofthrones,3dfqkl,Ninja_Bum,41,Thu Jul 16 01:42:25 2015 UTC,"They have actually. Every once in a while you'll hear a ""Ser Boros"" or ""Ser Mandon"", but it usually happens quickly. They're also usually wearing helmets which cover most of their face and make it hard to tell them apart.

gameofthrones,3dfqkl,Incruentus,7,Thu Jul 16 09:25:34 2015 UTC,Yeah Ser Mandon is gone though. Just Jaime and the Mountain now that Trant is dead. They pretty much gave all of Boros' lines to Meryn so he has no speaking role and is just basically an extra.

Since the Mountain won't be speaking and Ser Meryn is dead Jaime is probably going to be the only kingsguard who has any speaking role now.
gameofthrones,3dfqkl,BostonsLeprechaun,5,Thu Jul 16 03:23:44 2015 UTC,Barristan Selmy was on the kings guard and The Hound was named to the kingsguard so that makes 4

gameofthrones,3dfqkl,Ninja_Bum,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:34:42 2015 UTC,I am talking about current members of the kingsguard and how after Ser Meryn the only one of the present members who has ever had a speaking role to date is Jaime (the mountain spoke before but he can't now so that doesn't matter).  I am saying they are all generic save 2 currently. That is the point. There were more colorful characters and they are gone now save a guy who basically doesn't do kingsguard stuff on film anymore and a zombie brick house who can't speak.

In a nutshell, it lasted from the 1960s to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which is when most people say it ended. It consisted of years of sectarian violence between nationalist and unionist paramilitary groups. At the worst of it, there were bombings in residential areas and such, and it wasn't unheard of to be stopped on the street and asked which religion you are (catholic or protestant), as your religion tends to correspond to whether you are a nationalist or a unionist. If you answered incorrectly, then you would be stabbed, etc.  Today, it's a lot more rare to hear about things like that happening, though the wounds haven't quite healed and their are still incidents from time to time, particularly in specific areas of Belfast.   If your friend lives in a decent part of Belfast I can completely believe that she'd enjoy it there, and I'm happy to hear it :)  The worst part is the weather though! It's cold as nobs."

gameofthrones,3dd31u,questionernow,36,Wed Jul 15 10:04:45 2015 UTC,"A few understandable reasons. First off, I don't think they wanted to pass where he is in the books, they wanted to hopefully wait for Winds of Winter to be released before continuing with his storyline so they wouldn't spoil anything. Also they said there was a lot going on this season in general and didn't have time fit his storyline in anywhere. Also they said there isn't a lot going on in his storyline during the events of season 5, it's mostly just a giant off-screen Luke Skywalker-esque training session for Bran, no need to show that on screen I guess."
gameofthrones,3dd31u,dillardPA,12,Wed Jul 15 10:18:58 2015 UTC,"Also, Bran, his actor and his storyline aren't that popular with the audience (sad, but true), so the showrunners felt they could cease his storyline for a year, whereas Sansa was the direct opposite."

Sure, it isn't the most exciting but his journey has always seemed to have some of the largest implications for the whole story.

gameofthrones,3dd31u,RedditOakley,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"They will be continuing it, but they sped up his story to a point where it had caught up to the books. Now for a few character, they could add extra scenes after the books were caught up, but for Bran they'd have to create a whole new season long story line, so it was deemed better to just skip him for a season. Probably for the best, maybe we'll next see him after he has already learned a lot."
gameofthrones,3dd31u,IHaveLikeNoSpoons,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:05:44 2015 UTC,"It's because of the timing. If Bran's story continued in season 5 then it would have been a bit mismatched compared to the other storylines. If the speculations are correct, the next Bran scenes will be more flashbacks a la the Cersei flashback which we've already been warmed up with, that will provide context for events and characters in season 6."

gameofthrones,3dkdx7,a4187021,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"The audiobooks are nice for rereads, but the first time around I recommend that you actually read the books.  It's just much more difficult to really focus on the words when you don't actually have to do anything to consume the content. There will be instances where your mind starts to wander and you'll miss things. Probably without you even realizing it.  Also, if you're like me, then remembering names and making connections is way easier if you have a visual connection (i.e. seeing written words) instead of just hearing stuff."
gameofthrones,3dkdx7,LeBronnJamie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"I did a little of both when reading the series. I owned the books, however I did start reading them after watching the first few seasons into the show. Already knowing what happens in the first 2 books got really frustrating because they're so similar to the books, so on long drives I'd work through them on audio book.   I actually used the Audible app (if you sign up you get a free book and first month free right away) which was nice because you can speed up the speaking pace (I found 1.5x was a pretty natural pace) and the reader is Roy Dotrice who does a great job.   TL;DR I'd recommend having the physical copy of the book to actually read when you want, but the audio books are a great way to absorb the content."

gameofthrones,3dhugy,Rosebunse,4,Thu Jul 16 15:36:57 2015 UTC,I always found this theory a little suspect.   I think Tyrion being a dwarf is reason enough for Tywin to hate him.
gameofthrones,3dhugy,themaf,5,Thu Jul 16 15:36:58 2015 UTC,Wow. Did not even think that Jamie could be the secret targaryan. Mind blown
gameofthrones,3dhugy,EvilCatGod,2,Thu Jul 16 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"I think the Tyrion being illegitimate theory wouldn't be true just because it would reduce the dramatic impact of him killing his father if it was. Tyrion being Tywin's truest son, but still rejected, is so crucial to his character, and to Tywin's. (Plus, I think Tyrion's dwarfism being related to being illegitimate or some crazy supernatural theory (like the tinfoil D+D=T theory someone mentioned), instead of being just chance of nature, might be taken as offensive by people with dwarfism in real life, maybe including Dinklage. Though maybe that wouldn't stop GRRM and/or D&D.)"
gameofthrones,3dhugy,jelliknight,2,Thu Jul 16 12:10:35 2015 UTC,"Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year.   I'm not a book reader and i don't know if this theory is already going around, but doesn't that make it sound like Jamie is the bastard? And that Tywin being Tywin he had seen the possibility but refused to believe it, and that's why he took it so hard when his sister said that. She meant it figuratively, he took it literally and got pissed at her for shaking his denial. It makes sense on a number of levels. If jamie is a bastard then cersie is too, leaving Tyrion as Tywin's only legitimate child (ironically the only one he didn't want). It makes his hatred of Tyrion even more logical - he knows deep down that his only legitimate heir is 'deformed', and hates what that says about him and his lineage. It explains Joffrey being a crazy sadist (he's half mad-king), and possibly partly explains the Jamie/Cersie twincest (it's possible that a genetic drive toward incest exists in the targarians).  Is anyone NOT a bastard in king's landing?"
gameofthrones,3dhugy,gspence001,2,Thu Jul 16 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"Personality wise, sure he takes after tywin. He was raised by the man after all. However, couldn't the fact that tywin ignore her for so long be due to the fact that deep down he knows that despite the resounding resemblance in personality, tyrion's is not actually his son by blood.  Idk, I would hesitate to say that this part of the book ""completely shuts down any possibility"" of tyrion being gathered by the mad king."
gameofthrones,3dhugy,thewinneroflife,2,Fri Jul 17 06:56:33 2015 UTC,"I assumed Tywin didn't speak to her because she told him a hard truth. Tywin knows that Tyrion is most like him but doesn't like to admit it because it would mean giving Tyrion credit, so he was mad at her for pointing it out."
gameofthrones,3dhugy,runmelos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:49:09 2015 UTC,"She says Tyrion is the one who takes after their father Tywin, not Jaime .... it also shuts down any chance of him being fathered by the Mad King.   Well he was raised by Tywin after all, I wouldn't say that shuts down anything. It would even be ironic if the kid that isn't his turns out to be the most like him while his real kids are an utter disappointment.   From a conversation between Tywin and Tyrion:   You are an ill-made, devious, disobedient, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.   Low cunning? Tyrion? Sounds more like he's describing Aerys.   Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors, since I cannot prove that you are not mine. To teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that  proud lion that was my father’s sigil and his father’s before him.    That suggests that he has a suspicion about how Tyrion was conceived but can't prove anything. There's no way he could have killed him without being called a kinslayer if he has no proof.  Not saying that I 100% buy the Tyrion Targaryen theory but there's quite a bit implying it, I think GRRM at least wanted to make it look like a possibility."

gameofthrones,3diaal,ANukeGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:39 2015 UTC,I don't think Jaime's future is go back to King's Landing and hang with Cersei and the gang - I think he's not finished with Dorne.

gameofthrones,3dgbke,Aldebaran135,5,Thu Jul 16 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"The entire realm wasn't embroiled in war. Several places she might know of in the Stormlands, Tarth, possibly Highgarden -- Brienne spoke with Olenna and Margaery in S4 before departing, and while the Tyrells aren't exactly friends, they would be inclined to hide and protect the Stark heirs even if only to marry them to their reasonably nice and civilized family. Bookwise plenty of other ""safe"" places existed she might know about, including people famously fond of the Starks like the Reeds (in the Neck) or famously honorable (the Daynes in Starfall).  Brienne wasn't really ever too keen on thinking these things through, however."

""I will take the Kingslayer to King's landing and use him to trade for Sansa and Ayra by my honor for the oath I swore to their mother."" Alright, how? This hostage trade and negotiation will not be on any kind of neutral ground, but in/near King's landing, with crown's armies ready. As soon as Jamie is out of the reach of her blade, the Lannisters could just blast Brienne with arrows. She hadn't completely formulated a plan on how to do with even basic situations like ""I run into some people that recognize the Kingslayer, the most famous knight in Westeros.""

gameofthrones,3dgbke,emperor000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"I think it makes sense for Varys to marry Aegon to Dany because Dany would give Aegon legitimacy.

gameofthrones,3dhqx6,A_Hopeful_Pessimist,6,Thu Jul 16 11:08:10 2015 UTC,Getting it ready to be a less cgi version of Dany's vision?
gameofthrones,3dhqx6,CoffeeAddict76,4,Thu Jul 16 12:13:50 2015 UTC,"It's emblematic of where the power is/was over the course of Season 5. Cersei was really wielding the power, saying that Tommen had ordered things, but if he really did, it was because Cersei manipulated him into doing so. If he were to hold court on the Iron Throne, it would be very apparent who was in control/how weak the King really was and could encourage the enemies of the Throne/House Lannister.  Once Cersei was thrown in jail, the question for her and the viewer became ""Who's in charge now?"" Qyburn relays that Kevan and Pycelle have taken over the small council (or what's left of it), and Tommen ""won't leave his room."" So control of the Iron Throne is in disarray. I figure that the first side to get Tommen ruling from the Throne would be firmly in control of the Iron Throne."
gameofthrones,3dhqx6,fadhero,4,Thu Jul 16 11:35:12 2015 UTC,"In season 5 the Iron Throne was downplayed while the Great Sept was featured much more than previous seasons.  Intentional or not (I'm on the intentional side) it's symbolic of the weakening power of the King and the growing power of the Faith.  It's also not an accident that the season starts with Cersei arriving to the Great Sept as the most powerful person in King's Landing, if not Westeros, and ends with her leaving it with all her power and pride stripped from her.  If power resides where men believe it resides, then season 5 was about power shifting from the Throne to the Sept, and the lack of the most iconic prop in the show reinforced that."
gameofthrones,3dhqx6,komacki,2,Thu Jul 16 14:52:14 2015 UTC,Iconic...
gameofthrones,3dhqx6,dagobahh,5,Thu Jul 16 19:45:36 2015 UTC,The Icon Throne doesn't have the same appeal though.
gameofthrones,3dhqx6,PenisShapedFruit,2,Thu Jul 16 11:32:47 2015 UTC,Another random throne room question: Why was the stained glass design behind the throne replaced with the seven pointed star after season one? Was that just an artistic choice or did the set get damaged?
gameofthrones,3dhqx6,Megadelphia,4,Thu Jul 16 11:54:52 2015 UTC,I believe it was an artistic choice on Joffrey's part. In the books it is described how Joffrey takes down Robert's hunting carpets (that aren't in the show) and replaces them with torch thingies.
gameofthrones,3dhqx6,superpowersam,5,Thu Jul 16 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"Although there is still a redecorating scene in the show, the one where Cersei finally slaps him"

gameofthrones,3dmqbo,TheyKeepOnRising,23,Fri Jul 17 15:03:48 2015 UTC,"Prior to this, Cersei is very similar to the Sansa Stark we meet in the show. A little bit of teen drama, but mostly a good girl with fantasy of happily ever after.   I'm wondering where you got this impression. I know from the show, at least, the little insight we have into Cersei as a child was Oberyn's description of her cruelty to Tyrion. That didn't give me the impression she was all ponies and buttercups until she met Robert."

I can't see any parallels to Sansa besides maybe dreaming of marrying a gallant prince...but even that, the end game goal was the be queen."
gameofthrones,3dmqbo,LDreams,3,Fri Jul 17 16:21:45 2015 UTC,"That far fetched. Very far fetched.  Sansa is spoiled and annoying and only thinks of herself (at the beginning of the show), that's true.

There is clear contrast between the starks and the lannisters.  Ned Stark   ""He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. Farmers plowing fields are yours to protect. Servants scrubbing the floors are yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he wakes with fear in the mourning and goes to bed with fear in the night."" - robb stark   Robb Stark  Refused to execute prisoners despite running low on food, refused to torture prisoners. Contrast that to the lannisters who are seen killing every survivor at the battle of the green fork.  Sansa Stark  Made effort to save a knight from joffery, a man she didn't even know."

I might agree with you on Jaime though Jaime did nothing when Rickard and Brandon got executed by the Mad King, so why didn't him then? Robert is no Stark, so actually no need to argue about it here I think. Robert could obviously have done better, but you made this post to look at Starks and Lannisters. Jaime, Cersei and their children wouldn't have been executed for the crimes. You are right about Cat, no need to argue. ""Oh the Starks, quick tempers, slow minds"" Again, they wouldn't have been executed.   My conclusion: The Starks may have done mistakes, but in GoT there is no good or evil, in my opinion."

Before he goes to Robert to tell him what he found out about his ""children"" he goes to Cersei and tells her to take her children, and some men to defend them, and get as far away as they can. And you act like it is honorable for Jamie to push Bran off a ledge, crippling him, because he is having an affair with the Queen who is also his sister. And yes Jamie does deserve some dishonnor for killing the Mad King. The men of Kingsgaurd are sworn to lay down their life and protect their king no matter what. They forsake any claims to ancestral lands, vow to father no children, and serve only the king. Jamie not only kills the King he swore to protect, but he father's children as well. He is an oathbreaker. And you can't blame the Starks because Robert was in love with Lyanna. . I wouldn't say the Starks are morons. The Starks are honorable to a fault, and that is their downfall. The Lannisters, especially Tywin and Cersei, are manipulative people who would do anything and everything to stay in power. Let's also not forget what happened during Robert's rebellion. Tywin kept his army out of the war until Robert killed Rhaegar. Once that happened, Tywin marched his army on King's Landing. What they did there was terrible, killing innocent civilians, killing the Targaryen children, and as I mentioned Jamie breaking his oaths to kill Aryes. I'll give you that Tyrion is awesome and Jamie came around as the series went on, but there Cersei and Tywin are pretty terrible people"

gameofthrones,3di5fk,SentientDust,8,Thu Jul 16 13:43:28 2015 UTC,George R. R. Martin has shared his basic plans for the end of the series with the creative team at HBO - he is essentially on the team and has written scripts for the shows before (he is now focusing on finsihing the books).  This isn't being made up as it goes along - they've had a plan for the show and the books essentially from the beginning and they will end up in the same place and have many similar dynamics.  In many cases when the books and show have separated ways - it was to allow existing characters to bring interesting plot elements from the books into the series without introducing new characters.  In the books Sansa never goes to Winterfell and marries Ramsey - that's another character - the show runners wisely decided to get more screen time for a fan favorite and still be able to use that plot line.
gameofthrones,3di5fk,Skunkmulder,2,Thu Jul 16 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"Season 6 will be a skeleton version of TWOW.  Some parts wont change, like Jon being resurrected or Clegane-bowl.  Some parts have been cut entirely like the battle of Meereen, Young griff & his invasion of storms end and Arianne's role.  Other parts will be heavily condensed, for example:  Rather than Dany going to Volantis, Pentos & then Westeros, she'll go there directly.  Rather than Euron having a kingsmoot, attacking the shield isles, and then going for oldtown, he'll be crowned king right off the bat, and attack Oldtown.  The only storylines I don't have a clue for are Brienne, Sansa & The Dornish. I'm almost entirely sure the riverlands have been cut, but we may get the GNC.  Take your bets. There's no knowing where we're going."

Also, as a side note -- the oath that Sam took doesn't strictly say ""no sex.""  It says, ""I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.""  He can have as much sex as he wants.  He just can't marry her or get her pregnant.  As for Tyrion -- IIRC, Grey Worm is technically in charge, is he not?  I can see loads of conflict between GW and Tyrion as Tryion attempts to educate GW on the subtleties of ruling a city where half think you work for a living god and the other half want to slit your throat.  GW is smart, but he's not what I would call cunning or subtle, and I can see him disliking a lot of what Tyrion has to say.  Should provide for some interesting TV there."

gameofthrones,3df5vn,TangentManDan,7,Wed Jul 15 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"I honestly think jaqen is the faceless God. I think what he meant when saying Arya was ""not ready"" was that she wasn't ready to contribute her body to be used as a tool of the faceless God, because in order to do that she would have to completely forget about her life and become no one, which she can't.   Another theory is that Jaqen is just the faceless god's right hand man, an assasin who was unable to truly dedicate himself to his master by becoming no one, which is what he trained arya to be. This is evident when he mentioned that although arya isn't ready, she can serve a different purpose. The girl that arya talked to on the other hand was a girl who completely devoted herself to the cause and became a vessel for the faceless God by the end of the season. When jaqen swallowed the poison he effectively killed himself, and the faceless God added his face to the collection."

gameofthrones,3df5vn,TheKing_is_Dead,8,Thu Jul 16 14:38:52 2015 UTC,Dorne gets a bit complicated as they've written out Doran's two older children that actually play a part in the story. The idea you've discounted is the only one I've heard so far that seems to fit (with some caveats).  The idea isn't so much that he worked with Ellaria from the start. That the Sand Snakes almost botched his plans very much fits in from a book perspective. he just brought Ellaria in after that and gave her a key book speech offscreen (granted it was another person that received that speech) and then recruited her.  Doran has wanted to end the Lannisters since Robert's Rebellion. Question is whether they want the show version to have any hint of the long term plotting that the book version has. Book version naturally takes awhile before you learn his true motives.  Those motives? Vengeance. Justice. Fire and Blood.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,LeahxLove917,10,Wed Jul 15 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"Just remember that the wall protection against the white walkers has a lot o magic on it.  Its not just a kilometer tall ice wall, there is great magic forces within that prevents em from crossing it or destroying it ( unless using a certain horn that was omitted from the show ).  From the books we know very well that Dorne is playing the long game and has always been preparing for supporting a Targaryen king.  I will be curious to see if the show will skip completely the invasion of the golden company and appearance of 'aegon' or fit them into Daenerys storyline ( personally i think it will only confuse the viewers, having another targaryen or blackfyre or simply peasant boy, into the picture )"

gameofthrones,3df5vn,nixiedust,3,Fri Jul 17 16:17:23 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that they will possess the horn at some point. I don't expect the White Walkers to possibly take down the Wall untill (maybe) the last two episodes of season 6.  Yea... I'm not sure what's up with the whole Aegon part of the story.

gameofthrones,3df5vn,Sharkybell,2,Wed Jul 15 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think introducing him during Dany's conquering of Westeros would create a predicament for her which could be an interesting plot point, but I could also understand why they would omit him at this point."
gameofthrones,3df5vn,Phalanx300,2,Wed Jul 15 23:38:01 2015 UTC,The cover for Winds of Winter shows the horn so I'm almost certain that the wall will come crashing down!
gameofthrones,3df5vn,GoinLong,3,Thu Jul 16 00:01:02 2015 UTC,From what I've heard that was fan art and not a final cover. But I agree the horn of Joramun will come into play.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I just feel that it would be great if the collapse of the wall would be the point that makes everyone in Westeros realise that they're fucked!"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,GoinLong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:26:19 2015 UTC,Which would be completely badass. Can't wait to see that.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,iliketarik,2,Thu Jul 16 13:57:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the Wall was constructed by the White Walkers. Its a giant piece of ice magic, which they seem to be all about. Wights did manage to pass the wall before, so the magic that protects Bran and that Greenseer isn't protecting the Wall."
gameofthrones,3df5vn,ZeToast,2,Thu Jul 16 09:38:02 2015 UTC,"Wall is 700 feet not 1 kilometer tall. Also, it does not reach the sea on the west coast of Westeros. White Walkers could just go around like many wildlings have in the past."

gameofthrones,3df5vn,ZeToast,4,Thu Jul 16 01:02:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The one thing I would point out is that I don't think Loras' and Margaery's crimes are a matter of life or death. Therefore, a trial by combat would be a silly risk for them."
gameofthrones,3df5vn,ImmaSquidling,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:06:15 2015 UTC,Possibly... I feel like either way they'll make it out. At least Margery.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,WaffleWarrior89,4,Thu Jul 16 14:00:12 2015 UTC,Could someone explain to me the significance of the ring that danny drops please?
gameofthrones,3df5vn,harcile,4,Thu Jul 16 02:21:43 2015 UTC,She left it sort of as a trail so jorah and co. can know where she was and find her.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,GoinLong,3,Thu Jul 16 03:33:32 2015 UTC,I thought she dropped the ring so that the dothraki don't find out that she remarried. I do think it will be used as a plot device for Jorah and Daario to find her though.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,FlipaFlapa,2,Thu Jul 16 13:10:31 2015 UTC,That's what I thought originally but they said in one of the behind the scenes/commentaries that it was a trail thing.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,raudri,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think she wants Jorah and Daario to find it. I first thought it was the ring given to her by Drogo or something, but I'm not so sure."
gameofthrones,3df5vn,sloppy33,3,Thu Jul 16 14:26:34 2015 UTC,How many wights do the white walkers have? I hope in season six we get a shot of every single wight charging the wall while it all comes shattering down.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,Partylikechris,3,Wed Jul 15 23:20:14 2015 UTC,"What angers me about season 5 is that they rushed Stannis  storyline  and left out him uniting the north agianst the Boltons, but I think Littlefinger will take the north which gives him a good shot at taking the throne"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,African_AIDS,9,Thu Jul 16 02:46:34 2015 UTC,No Jon Snow and Stannis the Mannis TL;DR:s? No CLEGANBOWL! SACRILEGIOUS!
gameofthrones,3df5vn,Bastille12,8,Wed Jul 15 21:50:12 2015 UTC,I left them out because we've definitely covered that on this reddit enough.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,MagicallyDyketastic,7,Wed Jul 15 23:35:53 2015 UTC,You deserve a knighthood for that.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,arrheniusopeth,3,Thu Jul 16 01:02:52 2015 UTC,"Is that what we are calling gildings now? Because we should totally do that, make gold gifted on this subreddit show up as knighthoods.  Get the mods on this"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,LeahxLove917,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:19:27 2015 UTC,"Well that you, Ser!"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,MagicallyDyketastic,6,Thu Jul 16 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"Can't remember the exact quote but Varys says at one point that Littlefinger would burn the Seven Kingdoms to the ground if he could be king of the ashes, later Dany sees the throne room in Kings Landing essentially snowing ashes.  I don't care how tinfoil it is. Littlefinger for king!"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,CBAFCMV,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"See I've always thought that vision is telling the future of the throne room. Some people think it refers to Jon sitting the throne, but the entire roof is gone. That's definitely not a throne worth sitting on in that state.  Agreed! Littlefinger for King!"

gameofthrones,3df5vn,PastorWhiskey,2,Thu Jul 16 14:00:45 2015 UTC,What about Davos?
gameofthrones,3df5vn,Seraknis,2,Thu Jul 16 02:23:05 2015 UTC,Honestly... I have no clue. Without Stannis he's open to anything.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,sobric,2,Thu Jul 16 14:27:00 2015 UTC,This is very optimistic. I wouldn't expect D&D to not kill anyone.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,mal99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:47:54 2015 UTC,"Of course they can kill anyone at any time, but I can't predict that. None of this is 100%"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,Torgheron,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"I believe theon didn't survive the wall, but Sansa did, that seems like an interesting idea of Sansa having to survive on her own"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,dawgfan24348,5,Wed Jul 15 21:41:32 2015 UTC,I agree... I mean.. how much more can Theon take?  LOL  Poor dude.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,NachosPR,5,Wed Jul 15 23:38:40 2015 UTC,Book Theon survives the fall and meets Stannis afterwards. Theon's redemption arc is about to begin in the books so doubtful he'll be killed.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,LeahxLove917,2,Thu Jul 16 06:35:41 2015 UTC,"I think the first chapter in TWOW is a Theon chapter, and he has a few more, so I think it's safe to say that they both survived that fall."
gameofthrones,3df5vn,Cataclyst,2,Thu Jul 16 16:35:15 2015 UTC,That's cool. It will be nice to see Theon come back and kick some ass. He deserves to get revenge.
gameofthrones,3df5vn,GrampasGuitars777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"Added to OP's theories I reckon we can expect to see Theon, Tommen, Loras and Gilly die in season 6.   I also expect a 3 sided battle for Sansa between Ramsay, Littlefinger and Tyrion   And that Bran can warg a dragon (fly!)"
gameofthrones,3df5vn,GrampasGuitars777,2,Thu Jul 16 10:28:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think Theon will die, but it's possible. I could see a battle between Ransay and Littlefinger over Sansa, but not Tyrion at this point or anytime soon."
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,Jamesshrugged,30,Thu Jul 16 01:33:20 2015 UTC,"Olbligatory ""... gods he was strong then...""  General consensus on the hammer's location seems to be AGOT/S1"

gameofthrones,3dgcs9,hashinshin,23,Thu Jul 16 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"No he just rolled natural 20s. GM intended Rhaegar Targaryen to defeat the rebellion disaster, but he rolled two natural 20s in a row, and he isn't the sort of GM to cheat the game. PC is dead and the players rerolled. Of course the GM had to suddenly start rewriting the story as he went along."
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,muchacho78,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:51:56 2015 UTC,lmao daddy needs a new cloak
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,notbobby125,4,Thu Jul 16 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"When Robert died, besides Ned (who had other things on his mind at the time), who actually really gave a rat's ass about what they did with Robert's body or his prized weapon? Cersei would just see it as a constant reminder to the husband she hated, Jamie would see it as a reminder of the man who slept with his sister, Joffrey wouldn't be interested as it is to heavy to lift (thus useless to him as an object for inflicting pain), Littlefinger and the Spider would see it as something that would pointlessly annoy the new rulers.  Littlefinger might have some reason to swipe it and keep it, just in case using it to remind Cersei of Robert, or give it to another heir as a ""true"" sigh of their kingship to spread more chaos in the realm, but I would bet that his hammer is either forgotten in an armory, at Storm's End, or at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,mrdoucet,8,Thu Jul 16 07:01:21 2015 UTC,Well there's this   But the only time it might appear in the show is here. Unfortunately his helm is hiding the head.
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,antsugi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:25:09 2015 UTC,Thanks! I hadn't noticed the helm before
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,Andre_the_Pliant,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:43:06 2015 UTC,That's a sword...
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,hamza951,4,Thu Jul 16 13:18:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure we see it in Season 1, when Robert and Ned are in the tent preparing for the Hand's Tourney. Lancel runs off to fetch the 'breastplate stretcher' and we see the antlered Baratheon helm in the background, I'm almost certain the hammer was there as well."
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,CSNX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:23 2015 UTC,I dont think its important nor will it serve any purpose unless it has some magic I dont know of
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,phil725,13,Tue Jul 21 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"Well, he did use it to kill Rhaegar Targaryan, and conquer the seven kingdoms, so I thought it would be a big deal to the family."
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,CDoll23,3,Thu Jul 16 08:47:59 2015 UTC,"It was said to be so heavy that Ned could barely even lift it, let alone wield it. It is likely that it was place on display somewhere, as realistically no one else is really capable of using it. The family may revere it but, it really serves no purpose towards the shows mission at this point."
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,CSNX,3,Thu Jul 16 04:50:28 2015 UTC,Thats crazy if Ned couldn't even lift it bc Ned is able to wield Ice with no problem and thats a 2 hand great sword
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,Palfi,4,Thu Jul 16 05:00:56 2015 UTC,I think I read somewhere that valyrian steel swords are much lighter than normal swords
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,unluckyshot11,2,Thu Jul 16 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"It just illustrates how massive the hammer is , and how strong Robert really was."
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,slyder21lv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:11 2015 UTC,I think there is a difference between couldn't wield it and can't lift it.
gameofthrones,3dgcs9,-Kun-,2,Thu Jul 16 16:59:15 2015 UTC,If it's that heavy then mabe it will be given to Ser Robert Strong
