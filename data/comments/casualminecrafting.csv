I got it done before the crash, but when I logged in after it, it was missing. I used /co i and it said that I placed down the block but there was nothing in it's place, so I would be happy if you could help me out. If I remember correctly, I'm missing 1 beacon, 18 gold blocks and 146 iron blocks.  Thanks!"
casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,u1tr4me0w,2,Tue Jul 21 12:38:15 2015 UTC,So you lost all of those items from your inventory and from the world?
casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,MeatAndBandage,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"I dunno about Pancake's situation, but the same happened to me with much smaller items. I had been decorating my fishing shop in Meowtown, only to come back and find that the item frames & signs I had placed were gone, and the items I had placed in them were gone, too, like everything went back in time and erased the items I had made."
casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,kboy101222,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think anything went missing from my inventory, but I placed down a whole beacon set which got removed, but not by me, it just disappeared.

casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,pm_me_your_cellar,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:40 2015 UTC,5 is what we have now
casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,kboy101222,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:43 2015 UTC,"We've got 5 gb of ram currently and usually run at 66-90% ram usage, so 5 gigs should probably be considered the minimum the pack can run on.  Doing things like Twilight Forest raids tend to max out our ram usage, so we might have to reserve the TF for things like group raids or something."
casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,pm_me_your_cellar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:39 2015 UTC,"The box itself has 16GB of RAM, but I have 4 GB allocated to a RAMdisk since we currently have a mechanical drive and I don't want to be reading from that for world loading.  CMC then gets 5GB of RAM (since I upped it to 30 players), but I can lower that to ~3GB since we're not really going to use that I guess.  With that change you'll have more than enough. I could give you 6-7GB and your own IP + subdomain."
casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,viewless25,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:38:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 6-7 should be enough.  The only other issue we've had is with permgen space, which is mostly on our hosts side.    Out of curiosity, would kboy and myself have the ability to update the modpack on the server ourselves, or would we need to go through you to put the update on the server?"
casualminecrafting,3dzsa7,TheDoctor-,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:09 2015 UTC,I suppose I can run the forge server under a separate non-root capable account. Then you guys could control the server as you wish (via SSH/FTP).

I use version 1.06 Medium for gameplay (AMD laptop gets hot) but for screenshots and the like I use the High version. However, I am quite keen on trying out the 1.08 version, haven't given it a shot yet but hopefully it'll be nice (: I'd skip 1.07 altogether though, they make the lighting a bit too vibrant, reds and oranges especially just pop a bit too much."

casualminecrafting,3bdd1q,Chexytime,6,Sun Jun 28 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"I spawned in a desert with only a savannah and more desert in sight so I went to the savannah.  I gathered some wood and then quite soon saw a name tag.  I quickly made a wooden sword and went in for the kill.  It turned out to be Attraction and I killed her before she could do anything.  I dug down a bit looking for caves and quite quickly found one.  It had some lava flowing through it so as soon as I secured and lit up the cavern room, I went to stop up the lava.  As I was doing that, two witches came out of a tunnel I hadn't seen.  One got weakness on me and the other immediately after got poison on me.  After I killed them, two more came out of the cave.  After dealing with them, and going down to 1/2 heart from the poison, I made more torches and went into the tunnel.  I quickly found another witch and disposed of it before it 'saw' me.  I found some iron, i think like 8 or so ore and went back to my 'base camp' (formerly Attraction's).  I smelted it down and made a sword and pick.  I would have made iron but I didn't have enough left.  I went back down and followed the witch tunnel and came across a 'T' intersection with a creeper.  The creeper decided to go down one tunnel so I blocked off the other and went to make a cry-box to kill the creeper in.  Sadly, the creeper noticed me and I couldn't finish the cry-box.  I tried to attack it, but a lag spike hit me at just the perfect time and my hit didn't register.  The creeper killed me immediately (1/2 heart, no armor, nothing I could do).    I promptly rage quit.  Overall, I really enjoyed the UHC and can't wait for the next one.  I went into to this with the goals of killing at least one person, and not coming in last place.  I accomplished both of those and had fun."

casualminecrafting,3bdd1q,HiImRichieRich,4,Sun Jul 5 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"Notice: I'm awful at telling stories and this is probably going to be long. I'm sorry. I wanted to write about my stupidity for some strange reason.  I spawned in a forest near a desert and plains biome. After making sure no one was in sight, I began gathering wood and making tools. I quickly dug into a hillside and started mining.   After a bit I found some iron and coal, and then dug into a ravine. I mined the iron near the top and then jumped into the water at the bottom. There was a bunch of gold there, and I also mined all this. I had a few scares when several skeletons jumped me (they literally fell on top of me) so I tried to leave the ravine as quick as possible.  I decided to mine straight up (Bad idea, but it was the quickest option) I ran into several caves on the way up and had a creeper greet me in one, but I boxed myself in my little tunnel before it could explode.   When I got to the surface, it was day and I had ended up in the plains biome near a desert. I poked around the desert a bit and found a desert village with a blacksmith! I had a feeling the blacksmith was already looted, but I decided to still check it out. I was right, and left the village quickly in fear that whoever had looted it was still close.   By this point, night was falling, so I decided to hole up under a tree and smelt my iron. I made and iron pickaxe, sword, and armor. I stupidly forgot to smelt my gold. At this point it was day, but raining. I decided to tunnel towards spawn and dug a rather long tunnel before realizing it was in the wrong direction. (I was nervous...) I think by this point, the world border had started closing in. I thought it might be a better idea to run above round in the direction of spawn. After I ran for a bit, I realized I hadn't smelted my gold and holed up again in the side of a desert mountain.  I began smelting the gold as night fell again. After a bit, Wolf decided to warn people (me) that the world border was closing in. I look outside my little hobble and saw the border in all its red, gleaming evilness no less than five blocks away from me and my furnaces! I mined the furnaces, not caring to take all the gold out of them, and ran.   I made it to a savanna biome and decided to hole up again and finish smelting my gold now that I was safe from the world border. While it was smelting I thought I should go look for apples and ran over to some lone oak trees and started destroying leaves. I found a couple of apples and ran back to grab my gold. It was starting to get close to night, so I dug underneath a tree in a small forest and waited. Soon after I holed up again, adc picked off drachir, and I started to panic. I mean, this was my first ever UHC, and I was going to place in second. (I knew I wouldn't have enough luck to kill adc. He had full health and enchanted golden apples!) I surrounded my hole in cobblestone and started crouching, because that was totally the best way to defeat/hide myself from adc (not).    After about a minute of this, I saw adc's name tag and started getting really terrified. Outside of my hole,  I had done some digging which ended up leading directly to my hiding place. I only just realized this as he jumped into my little trail. Fantastic. adc had found me. He started digging through my cobblestone wall, and the second he broke through the wall, I placed back a block. adc couldn't even hit me. This carried on for a bit, from a bunch of different angles, until he found a way to hit me between placing the block of cobblestone. adc repeated this until I died.   It was the stupidest death I had ever had.   I didn't even get a hit on adc, or anyone for that matter. Overall, the UHC was fun and very, very, nerve-racking. I could barely stop shaking during the entire thing. :P"

I totally got up on the wrong side of the bed: made wrong tools, waited too long to get cobble. I even almost starved when i thankfully found some cows. After like five minutes my only tool was a wooden axe. I then saw a person in the distance, who was adc! I ran as fast as i could as I would not have had a chance against him. He did not follow me though as he did not want to loose health so early.  I then started to cave and got myself armored up (made two pair of boots :P). I did not find gold or diamonds yet though. A lot of time passed. This was a pretty long UHC. I spend time by staircasing up and down, only to see the sun just going down and then waiting for the night to pass.  I came up in a desert again and then i found a player. I was scared because I only had an iron sword and it looked like he had a diamond sword. Nonetheless I ran towards him. It was durschel! The poor guy only had .5 hearts left :/ so i went for the kill after running after him and avoiding the lava he put down. From him I got enough gold to make a golden apple.  I then continued to go to 0,0. There I encountered on Murdoc! After some intense approaching and him landing some very good bow shots I killed him with my diamond sword! I got a bow from Murdoc and started to farm flint from gravel only to get nearer to my own death. Adc, aka The Mass Murderer, surprised me while I was farming peacefully. I did not see him after he shot me a lot of times. I ran away and tried to hit him with my bow but he eventually got me :(  The unbeatable adc then fought against Ava and won the UHC! Overall I am really happy that I made the third place and got two kills (my first kills in all three UHCs).  Edit: And i intended to make it shorter than jeb's :P"
casualminecrafting,3bdd1q,HiImRichieRich,3,Sun Jun 28 09:35:17 2015 UTC,I love all the details!  That sounds so exciting! :D  GREAT JOB on third place! adc just told me today that he won and showed me what his wish was.

Teasus said let there be day and night! He created two squares that were stitched into the dome of the sky. The sun and the moon. Teasus saw how good this was. Evening came and morning followed, the third day.   Teasus said let there be plants and birds and rocks and things! And so it was! Except the birds part, Teasus was pretty bummed. Evening came, morning followed the fourth day.   Teasus said, let there cows, pigs, rabbits, sheep, and other harmless animals. Teasus messed up on the sheep and accidentally created Adc. Teasus made a mental note to eliminate the abomination later, but has yet to do so. Teasus was adequately pleased with the day. Evening came morning followed, the fifth day.   Teasus said, let there be ores of differing value and uses! And so it was! He also created sheep fo' realz this time. Evening came morning followed, the sixth day.   Teasus said, let there be players made in my image. Alex and Steve were created. Teasus said to them, ""Make more Alexes and Steves and fill this server!"" And so it was. Teasus saw how good it was.

Jenshaal and I have been working on railroads from Spawn to other points of interest (mesa and several cities) on the sever and moving spawn would kinda suck for our efforts. Rebuilding spawn would be a lot of fun and could be an interesting community experiment.   Also, having a vote on the theme or atmosphere of the new spawn would probably be positive. I like a more earthy feel, and having a spawn that's not super grand and majestic is a little more fun and a little less daunting to new players. Each to their own, though, and if the consensus is that a large biodome should be our new spawn, then by all means majority should rule.  Just my $3.50"

But I mean if it's something like a space station, sure, but perhaps that could be an initial spawn and you could drop into a village or something that the people vote on.  However, I really don't get the use of rails, if you are going to use rails then I think you should at least do it underground, but I think that you make a central hub away from the normal spawn that people can teleport to.  Personally I think that using rails or non contained spawns. (Non contained being something like a village that doesn't end and have obvious barriers) is counter productive, since its just more work that could be better spent on other projects, where a simple dropship (for more style) or teleport system could be managed.  Look, I'm also for building it live after a vote. Like /u/shawnaroo said. We could always make a smaller spawn temporarly and have people teleport to the normal spawn to watch. However, my building team and I would need permissions like WE and EssPro. Not sure if you would be willing to give them out temporarily as they make things so much easier. But the thing with building it separate from the main server would be that the mods wouldn't have to worry about that.   Anyway, just my $4.38 AUD."

casualminecrafting,35p9jy,randomredditguy13,2,Tue May 12 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with spawn being reworked or moved, but building it somewhere else and then world editing it in is lame. Build it live or get out."
casualminecrafting,35p9jy,AmillyCalais,1 point,Tue May 12 12:06:41 2015 UTC,I am simply suggesting to build it in a separate server to allow for infinite resources without it interfering with the current spawn for the moment.
casualminecrafting,35p9jy,theKunz1,2,Tue May 12 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"I understand, and I am entirely against that idea.   The current spawn is pretty weak, and I don't think that interfering with it is a problem.   If you need resources, then ask the community to contribute."
casualminecrafting,35p9jy,teaearlgraycold,2,Tue May 12 15:28:32 2015 UTC,I just wanted to say that I really like the simple village theme of the spawn and the nearby vault. It was a nice place to start out and to visit as I play.
casualminecrafting,35p9jy,Deathcommand,1 point,Tue May 12 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree. I like to think of Spawn being a hommage to the original minecraft villages, since all our cities are so very very very different."
casualminecrafting,35p9jy,KM1604,1 point,Tue May 12 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"Due to the world border and the location of the vault, I would have to be against moving its location. However, I would not be against a new spawn as long as the style is also kept casual (to fit the server name).   Also, I like the idea of new spawn being created in survival rather than creative, which would help give it that more casual and organic feel. We could build it somewhere isolated on the server then have an admin copy it over.   All that being said, I am fine with both the old spawn and the creation of a new, still casual feeling one."

casualminecrafting,330q00,HiImRichieRich,2,Sat Apr 18 13:39:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe the fact that I spawned 300 spiders could have helped? Also, I was 2 blocks away from the iron bar when I got poisoned. Weird"
casualminecrafting,330q00,HiImRichieRich,2,Sat Apr 18 13:41:36 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe :) it only happened once or repeatedly?

casualminecrafting,32vd89,nashife,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:25:46 2015 UTC,I added another piston with block now. So the following spiders are kept at a higher distance and maybe this does not happen again :)
casualminecrafting,32vd89,HiImRichieRich,2,Fri Apr 17 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"Uhm haha well.. xD   So, normally the spiders would not attack you after they were damaged (so when the door opened) and they would be attacking when the door was closed. That is the reason for the door. At least this was the case when i tested it (and that was a lot :P).  Apparently they do seem to attack "":) Can you tell me how exactly it happened? Was it repeatedly or just one time? Where did you stand? Could you approach them?  I'll remove the sign though ;) :P"
casualminecrafting,32vd89,HiImRichieRich,2,Fri Apr 17 10:30:57 2015 UTC,"Well, when you trap the big bunch of spiders into suffocation, then ""release"" them to punch them to death, there is no problem. Those spiders are totally harmless, even though they're closer to you.  The problem occurs after you did your little spiders genocide, in a situation as shown on the screenshot. There are only the spiders waiting for you downwards, still not trapped. Surprisingly, those spiders may be able to attack you, and you may be able to attack them.  It's not systematic and the attack window is tiny, you must be quite close anyway. If you take my screenshot as reference, you should probably move one block closer to be attackable.  So there is no real treat, and I noticed you were auto-healing. I found it just funny to happen with this sign very next to me. :^)"
casualminecrafting,32vd89,HiImRichieRich,2,Fri Apr 17 11:42:07 2015 UTC,"Interesting, even though the distance is rather high. I only noticed when you stand next to one of the canals and then punch a spider it might punch back. I guess it's pretty similar here. But your right it's funny! The sign is kind of ironic in that situation xD  Thank you very much for your feedback! Maybe i'm going to add another piston with block to increase the distance to the waiting spiders."

Donator benefits don't really affect gameplay, we only have a few plugins (dynmap, essentials, residences) and don't have many rules (check the sidebar)  It's not perfectly vanilla. Because of our casual nature everyone has the ability to request teleports to each other, and there are warp locations set up across the map.  You can claim a few areas (up to 80x80 blocks) that will be protected, although griefers are very rare here."

The only way you'd be able to let other people join you is if you are running a server, or doing minecraft realms or something. You can let people who are on your network join your local game if you know people IRL who want to help, but afaik, the only way for random people on the internet to join you is to be on a remote server, or do realms."

If you really want to get a cat, you can replant a jungle biome, if it kinda looks like a jungle, cats /should/ spawn. You can test this in creative if you want.

casualminecrafting,30ot09,nashife,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"no, but the biome is still jungle, you cannot affect biomes, you can, however, affect the landscape, and make a jungle look like plains etc. I'm guessing that the game looks for jungle landscapes in jungle biomes to spawn cats. so by restoring the jungle landscape(by planting jungle trees) in jungle biomes you might be able to reenable cat spawns. Tell me if you're really interested in trying  that and we can work something out."
casualminecrafting,30ot09,cyprex_,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:21:38 2015 UTC,according to the minecraftwiki:   Ocelots try to spawn on grass blocks or leaves at sea level or higher in jungle biomes.
casualminecrafting,30ot09,cyprex_,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what you mean. You're suggesting replanting jungle trees IN the jungle biome.   Understood.   In my experience (a few patches ago, granted), cats spawn just fine in jungle biomes that have been flattened, so I'm not sure if the landscape issue is why we haven't seen any cats.  I've also experienced the issue where cats stop spawning in jungles where there is frequently a player presence due to what some people thought was a bug in the cat's ""shyness"" mechanism. In some of my SP worlds, I had to travel to a different jungle far from the one I'd built my base before I saw cats spawn.  I don't know if that could be an issue affecting our server, but it's possible (and something we can't fix because we only have the one jungle)."
casualminecrafting,30ot09,nashife,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"we have more than one jungle biome i believe, as far as i know a greifer burnt them down. also, mob spawning only happens 32 blocks away from the player  edit: nevermind i seem to be wrong, we only have 1 crappy jungle."

casualminecrafting,2xmijy,teaearlgraycold,2,Fri Mar 13 01:01:44 2015 UTC,From wikipedia;   Fall guy is a colloquial phrase that refers to a person to whom blame is deliberately and erroneously attributed in order to deflect responsibility or blame from another party.   In my case more used as an account I don't keep any valuable items on for doing dangerous building tasks/other things that could go badly wrong.

casualminecrafting,2x4qa0,forrcaho,4,Wed Feb 25 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"Fire Resist Potions, an essential for any trip to the nether, unless its a short one.  Unless you are specifically working in an area and need it not on fire, it's usually not worth it to put out fires.  Never attack pigmen Always have a stack of blocks on you, whether to pillar up, block yourself in, or create a bridge. The netherrack surrounding you works, but for added protection you can use cobble or some other block that can't be destroyed by ghasts. Create a res with a simple name so that you can tp away from danger in an instant. It must be a res tp so that you don't have to wait 8 seconds. Plain protection is the best kind of protection on armor, as it protects you from everything well. Type-specific protections might be better at their thing, but are weaker than normal protection in all other types of damage.  Always have a bow. This'll help you deal with ghasts and blazes very easily."

casualminecrafting,2utfqu,GuyNamedWhatever,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:47:01 2015 UTC,"I think it will get flooded after lots of people start posting for trade, and other people who dont want to trade anything might not like the constant stream of trade posts. making a sub gives us a choice whether or not to see trade posts at all"
casualminecrafting,2utfqu,GuyNamedWhatever,1 point,Thu Feb 5 02:36:57 2015 UTC,"I think the key words here are ""you think"". Honestly we could just make a weekly thread and direct all trades there, because honestly I can't imagine trade posts becoming such an annoyance that we'd have to make a completely new subreddit just to keep organized. Yafeelme?"
casualminecrafting,2utfqu,teaearlgraycold,1 point,Thu Feb 5 02:59:21 2015 UTC,yeah im just speculating

Rules are provided nearby, and all gear is supplied for you, unless you agree with your opponent that you can use gear you have made yourself (but it may burn up in lava, so be careful).  This is iteration 1 of the arena and is still unfinished. It is asymmetrical though I don't feel one side has a particular advantage over the other. It is most likely subject to change at some point."

So far, two houses are done, a watchtower is in the works, and I've made a canal connecting the sea to the western ocean. I have the plans made for another house and a dock, and have several more watchtower locations ready.   Next on the list is to design a bridge to cross the sea (east-west) at its narrowest point.

casualminecrafting,2uceht,fml-6626,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Make wooden hoe and use the left-click to select the primary coordinate, and right-click somewhere else to select the secondary, and that'll select a volume with the two coordinates as opposite corners.  Once you've done that you can then look straight up and down and use  /res expand X   where X = how many blocks up or down you want to expand the selected volume.  You can also do this to expand in the X or Y planes by looking in a given direction."
