iamverysmart,3dzmxx,Melkath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:57:37 2015 UTC,High schools will often use a 5 point system for the AP classes--which is kind of silly because it just ends up inflating the grade (at least for the kids who do all honors everything). My high school was like that--very competitive and you couldn't even crack the top 10% unless your GPA was well over a 4.0.   My guess is his middle school has some kind of 5 point system for honors kids to prep them for high school?
iamverysmart,3dzmxx,ingleback,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:24 2015 UTC,"Honors/AP students get a GPA bonus. It's cheating. Any time I see a GPA above 4 I go ""Oh, so you had an administration cheating for you"".  I graduated roughly ranked 1200 out of 2000. 1-1100 all had 5.0 GPAs. In other words, in a mormon town, if your daddy has a favor to call in, you get a 5.0."
iamverysmart,3dzmxx,Melkath,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:31 2015 UTC,How is it cheating to get more credit for taking harder classes?
iamverysmart,3dzmxx,ingleback,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"Because you are being measured on a different scale from other students that affords you more points.  If you are doing track, you cant compare the 20 yard dash kids to the 200 yard dash kids, and just score the 200 yard dash kids with a -20 second bonus.  If i enroll in an ap class and suck ass, im still being rewarded more than a kid in a normal class who is kicking ass.  It is cheating."
iamverysmart,3dzmxx,Melkath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"20 yard dash is not necessarily easier than the 200 yard dash, just different. The non-AP classes at my public school were much, much easier than the AP classes. Kids in AP classes are being rewarded for challenging themselves and taking harder classes they don't have to take.  A kid that is making Bs in an AP class is awarded the same GPA as someone who is making As in a regular class. The purpose is to encourage kids to take the harder classes. If they were rewarded equally, why would anyone except the most motivated kids take the AP classes? It's not only fair, but is beneficial for the school as a whole."

For example, if your friend took five APs and you took five APs and something like band, the maximum GPA you could get is less than what your friend can get even though his schedule is less intensive."
iamverysmart,3dzmxx,c3h8pro,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this happened to me. My school offered GPA exemptions for one class per year after sophomore year though, which I just applied to band for the last two years."

However, that's not to say that everyone's vision of a ""benefit"" is the same. We can divide this idea into two categories: we can believe that the greatest benefit comes from focusing on the individual, or focusing on society or any societal group as a whole.  In the case of communism, within the terms of corporatism, everyone reaps the greatest benefits if the state treats everyone equally, using Karl Marx's conflict theory as its basis: the society that does not recognize social class does not suffer from inequal treatment by the government, and this is the greatest benefit.  With capitalism, everyone reaps the greatest benefit if the individuals of society are given the opportunity to be self-supporting economically, and that by meeting economic success, you enable other people to become self-supporting, based on the idea of trickle-down economics.  So I'm not saying you're wrong, but you're taking one big step when there are two smaller ones, so to speak."

Profit is necessarily theft because because to get it, you must pay less than the value of the item or service provided.   You're right that the growth of corporate powers and stuff aren't necessary in capitalism, but they do make frequent and common bedfellows. Protection of investment and growth of investment powers such that you can isolate pockets of wealth and deny more of the value of their work seems like a lofty goal by capital virtue.

iamverysmart,3dzgn0,riggorous,16,Mon Jul 20 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"She has an IMDB write-up, written by ""Friend.""   At the age of 10, a standard ear training test was given to those interested in joining the school band, and the odds of making a perfect score were 1 in 6,000 - Carla René made a perfect score.   She studied voice, piano and trumpet at Davis & Elkins College, a Liberal Arts College in a small town in West Virginia, with a minor in percussion, after a brief foray as a mathematics/physics major.  Along with her vocal performing, she played trumpet in the Elkins Community Brass Quartet where she also arranged music for 4 and 5 horns. She sat fourth and solo chair in ""The 1940's Radio Hour"" and was chosen as the assistant musical director, rehearsal pianist, vocal coach for soloists and auxiliary percussionist for the college production of ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"". She dropped the percussion minor, and took Theatre Arts as her minor. Her original intent was to take a beginning acting class to become a better performer. That class was where the acting bug bit her.  In July of 1990, she was notified that she had been chosen from a national audition as a vocalist for the camp and tour, ""On the Road"". 8 were chosen. It was here that she met critically acclaimed songwriters Geoff and Becky Thurman, and they expressed interest in her as a writer. Geoff wrote and co-produced Glenn Campbell's recent gospel album, but his claim to fame came when he wrote the Grammy-winning song ""Jehovah"" which put Amy Grant on the charts.  In 1991, she was given a music scholarship to Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, where she concentrated on a Commercial Trumpet Performance degree. While there, she sat first chair in the Belmont Concert Band, Belmont Jazz band (Under the direction of jazz great, Jeff Kirk) and the Belmont Student Brass Quartets and Quintets, where she once again did music arranging. Through a cooperative agreement with Vanderbilt University, she fulfilled her dream of marching with a University band by sitting first chair trumpet in the Vandy Marching Band where she was also a soloist.  While in Nashville, an audition with the Avant Garage Dinner Theatre introduced her to the art of improvisation. They specialised in original comedies, and her first leading role garnered her a nomination as ""Best Lead Actress in a Comedy"" for the ""Nashville First Night Awards"".  Since then she has done many productions in Professional and Community Theatres in her home base of Nashville, including ACT 1, Lakewood (where she was nominated ""Best Character Actress in a Play"" her first performance there), Performance Factory, Actor's Playhouse, Dennis Ewing's Theatre Horizons, and Backstage Studio, Razor's Edge, and Actors' Bridge Ensemble Theatre.  In 1994 she began studying stand-up comedy, and has since performed it regularly, opening for top names at Zanies and other Nashville-based comedy clubs.  In the summer of 2001, she was awarded the ""Musical! The Musical!"" scholarship by founding member and Second City alum, Nancy Howland Walker, for the 2001 Funny Women Fest. In the spring session of 2006, she returns to study for another session with Second City.  In the summer of 2002, while completing a three-year acting program in DC, she opened in a comedy at The Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts.  In October, 2004, she published her second short story in horror fiction and began work on two novels: one, a dark comedy about her relationship with her mother, post-stroke, and another a collection of dark comedic essays; both have generated interest from agents.  She has several hours under her belt for her single-engine certification as a private pilot, she's moderate in German, is a faithful practitioner of T'ai Chi Ch'uan, and is an award-winning artist in several mediums, with oils being her favorite.  She currently lives with her two cats Playdoh, and Isabella, and does a steady diet of web-design to help her sate her desire for all things artistic.  She has won several awards for her graphic designs. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Friend"

However, I travel through a lot of the city first.   I was coming back from the East Coast and my flight kept getting delayed. Instead of getting back at noon, I got back at like 10 or 11 at night. Anyways, it's later and there are less people outside. I wait out by the bus stop, get on the bus, and sit on the next bench over from some drunk black guy. Now, I didn't know he was drunk when I got on. I just sat down. I soon regretted my decision.  The entire bus route he sat there, drinking and talking to himself. He was saying some pretty far out there shit. Talking about crips and bloods, and himself as Jesus. Talking about killing people, people attacking him, all sorts of crazy shit. I was on edge the entire ride, hoping that he wouldn't take a swing at me in a drunken frenzy. He didn't, fortunately, and I made it back fine. Still, never a good idea to sit next to a crazy drunk."

Things quickly took a turn for the weird however when I asked if he was a friend or family member. He explained his lineage could only be found in the bible. He then began to recite a long list of Hebrew names, ending with his distant relatives John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. Not wanting to be rude to him in front of the rest of his family, I listened to this guy as he went into great detail why he was direct descendants from all of these people. I was later apologized to, and told that he was completely peanuts."

iamverysmart,3dvw0a,Elaine_Benes_,30,Mon Jul 20 14:13:05 2015 UTC,"Telekinesis, like many other super-powers, consists of twisting one's interpretation of reality until it fits one's desire.  I've once used my super-power of telekinesis to prevent a bunch of other kids at camp from successfully lighting a match long enough to start the camp fire. Incidentally, it was a windy day.    Also, that one time, I totally communicated with the spirits by using a deck of cards. The basic brain pattern is the same. Ignore everything that doesn't fit, focus on the bits that do, interpret liberally and you too can acquire occult and mysterious powers.  And yes, somehow, this can be easier to do when you're too young to know any better."

But, as someone with a mood disorder, I will say that it feels like never having any control over how you feel or what you do and say. And being that way for so long you're not sure anymore what's actually you and what's the disease. Oh and then the added fun of trying medication after medication to try and find something that normalizes you and trying to figure out what ""normal"" feels like and what feelings are coming from the medications..."
iamverysmart,3dvw0a,richie-the-third,2,Mon Jul 20 06:17:14 2015 UTC,I have Bipolar Type 1 and you pretty much nailed it with your description. I often have cycles where I say and do awful things while manic then a few weeks later sink into depression and anxiety triggered by the things I did.

And unless you know what to recognize, you don't even know you're on it. You feel out of control, and you don't know why. You feel depressed, and you don't know why. You feel on top of the world, you can do anything--where did these wonderful feelings come from? Oh, they're gone...  Are these really your feelings or are they the disorder? Is there even a distinction between the two?  That's my experience with Type II, which is the ""light"" version.   edit: by light I mean I've never been manic"

Not because I secretly know these things not to be true, because deep down I believe my delusions, but because I'm also paranoid and I don't want to be assassinated by certain people (you know who you are, you fuckers).
