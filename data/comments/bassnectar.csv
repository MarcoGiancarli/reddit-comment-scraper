I was really beginning to worry once it was clear Beyond Wonderland's lineup was done and he wasn't there. I guess this means he's Friday at Tomorrowworld?  Not sure what to think of this new festival they're putting up, but I bet they paid a shitload to get him there. Hoping some other good acts get announced in wave 2 for Sunday."

My question is.... they say multi stage, but that park is not that big and that waterfront is surrounded by industry, I'd expect a lot of noise bleed. Do you think Nas will be on same stage, preceding Bassnectar?"

bassnectar,3e4hba,EONS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:17 2015 UTC,It's basically the port. You're getting off interstate and going through the port to a park. Nothing there to be scared of.  It's right next to the Bay Bridge on Oakland's side and is going to have a surreal view of the bridge and san francisco across the most narrow point.

First 30 minutes was all random old dubstep by random artists that BLEW ME AWAY.  Loco Ono remix before it came out, alongside a consistently filthy set that left me smiling ear to ear.  Oh and Pink Elephants, 808 track, Infinite to close it out."
bassnectar,3e2fx1,Strapled,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:32:34 2015 UTC,yeah first 30 of moonrise was basically completely random shit. liked that part of the set the most

Last year's set was awesome, and those last 15 mins are my favorite section of any set ive seen. Family Photo > Pink Elephants > 808 track > Expanded with Sabotage over it > Infinite to close.  Somewhere else in this thread someone said he wont go as hard cuz of the crowd, but sometimes i feel like he goes extra hard for people who might not know him as well. Example being Ultra this year. Who knows with him tho its always a toss up and thats why we go ya know?"

bassnectar,3e2fx1,StanlyBaratheon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:45:09 2015 UTC,In 2014 it was said it was his last year then he came back swinging with 3 Nights and a new sound system that allows for him to play loud but direct it away from Morrison. I could totally see him coming next year but even if he doesn't im sure there will be other special events or HOPEFULLY a tourrr
bassnectar,3e2fx1,assfacefobbs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"Moonrise set last year was very beginner-accessible, I expect it to be similar to that and not as dirty/original/basshead-pandering as the Bisco revenge set.  Honestly it's not a big surprise, the Moonrise atmosphere is a lot more 'candy-eating thong-wearing rave baby' than most and there will be a good bit of first-timers.  A lot of my friends decided after Bisco that they wouldn't do Moonrise or MIA after all, because it's a silly crowd and they don't think it'll compare (or just be too similar) to Bisco/Red Rocks (plus we did Roo and Forest also).  Hopefully that's wrong and our boy will throw down another unexpectedly ridiculous set, but I'm not crossing my fingers; my expectation is a lot of the same stuff we've already got.  That being said, if you haven't been to see him this summer, you're in for such a treat.  The new stuff sounds killer and the main stage at Pimlico is a pretty good set up.  You can get a nice view/sound just about anywhere, which is precious to me after the difficulty of the Forest crowd.    The 2015 sets I've been to have been some of my favorite, I think you will agree."
bassnectar,3e2fx1,StanlyBaratheon,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"It is on 808 Day though so i'm hoping for something somewhat special. I know Moonrise may not be a fest you expect him to throw down at like Bisco, but given the day i'm sure he will have some tricks up his sleeve as he always does. The lack of a fall tour as well has caused every set he's done this summer regardless of location to be something special."
bassnectar,3e2fx1,assfacefobbs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:06 2015 UTC,aye I didn't realize that date
bassnectar,3e2fx1,StanlyBaratheon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:07 2015 UTC,I think its pretty silly to base what he's gona play on the crowd/type of festival. He threw the fuck down at EDCLV and Ultra this year.
bassnectar,3e2fx1,ben10103,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that people who have been to a lot of sets this summer may not get a lot of new stuff at Moonrise, judging from his set there last year.   I'm saying I have friends who are not going for those reasons, and I'm still going in hopes that they're wrong."
bassnectar,3e2fx1,ben10103,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:06 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with that, it was just your first statement in the original comment I disagree with: predicting what type of set he'd play this year at moonrise based on last year's as well as the type of festival/type of crowd it'll have. Anyways last year moonrise was the fucking tits of a set, I can't remember everything but that was the last time I had heard 100 and he also did Pink Elephants (which isn't all that rare but is still awesome)  eidt: also what do you mean by may not get a lot of new stuff? He has been playing like 6 or 7 songs off ITS at every fest set this summer"

bassnectar,3e0unj,EyyoEddie,6,Tue Jul 21 06:04:38 2015 UTC,I was at bisco this weekend and while I wasn't one of the people sitting at the rail all day I was in the pit like 3-4 hours before nectar came on. And 200 people sittin/camping the rail is an EXTREME exaggeration. When I got in the pit there was MAYBE 100 people in there.  And of that there was only a hand full of people who were at sitting at the rail. That picture must have been at the worst because I never saw more than 5 or so people sitting.
bassnectar,3e0unj,EONS,3,Tue Jul 21 09:44:06 2015 UTC,"No man. Look at Bassnectar's twitter. He retweeted some bassheads who have pics of them sleeping against the rail, and someone else linked one of at least 80 peopel in a huge cluster preventing anyone from getting within 15 feet of the rail in a ~40 foot long span.  Donno what you think you saw, but you didnt see everything apparently."
bassnectar,3e0unj,EyyoEddie,3,Tue Jul 21 10:22:30 2015 UTC,"Not saying I don't believe you, but could you find that picture of 80 people, I haven't seen and would like too."
bassnectar,3e0unj,EONS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"It was tweeted out by a fan of The Werks during their set. IT was a very pathetic looking picture, band up on a stage, rail, 40-80 people all sleeping or turned away from the stage."
bassnectar,3e0unj,EyyoEddie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:24 2015 UTC,It's not the picture in the actual article right....
bassnectar,3e0unj,EONS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:09:42 2015 UTC,"Correct. Different picture. Straight on shot, wide angle, from farther back (showing how dense the pack of rail-campers was).  Idk why it's in so much debate. Even The Disco Biscuits, who were a mere 10 feet in front of the rail campers (and I think did 2 sets there with them camping), said it was over 200 people."
bassnectar,3e0unj,laggy2da,6,Tue Jul 21 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"I always try and look at things from both perspectives, and I can empathize with both sides on this.  For the bassheads, I can imagine they were super excited to see bassnectar, and if there's no one else they're particularly excited to see that day, why not camp out for your favorite artist? These types of deals are first come, first serve. And then when others get mad that you're up there? Well they really want front row for bassnectar, and had the dedication to wait there for hours on end, why should they move?  But then I can really empathize for the other bands. Imagine you're REALLY stoked to see a band, but another bands fans overtake the entire crowd in front of you. The band you wanted to see is KILLING it, and the fans of the other band are all standing around uninterested, sitting down, playing on their phones, etc. That would completely kill the vibe of the show. I'd be pissed too. It's not just rude to the fans of the band, it's rude to the band themselves who are pouring their energy into a set to a bunch of uninterested people up front  The answer, as Brownie pointed out, comes from better festival organization. Clear the pit between shows. Bonnaroo has a great system for this at the main stage. You can wait in line all day for any show, but you wait at the side, and the pit is cleared between every act to allow in the fans of that show."
bassnectar,3e0unj,w0oster,7,Tue Jul 21 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, this needs to find its way to The Disco Biscuits and the bands/fans affected by this whole ordeal. Thank you to whoever wrote this. It's people and thoughtful sentiments like these that really make me proud of this community. Not the immature and inconsiderate ones that we are slowly becoming represented by. So glad that these kind of problems are being addressed."
bassnectar,3e0unj,Umphreeze,11,Tue Jul 21 03:43:18 2015 UTC,"It pretty quickly has spread throughout tDB facebook groups.   It's a shame for you guys. As a long, long-time Biscuits fan, I know all too well what it's like for a subfaction of your fanbase to ruin your scene/image for everyone else.  Those kids really are out of hand though. I'm not a big BN fan by any means, but I've had a good time at some of his shows, and have probably seen him around 20x (the first time being before tDB on NYE 06) and the scene has gotten progressively insane every time I've seen him. Camp was most definitely not an isolated occurrence. I have way too many stories from festival sets over the last few years of shit I've witnessed that's just been like...a really mindblowing level of inconsiderateness.   I don't really get it."

bassnectar,3e0unj,ballsdeepfun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"It's kind of selfish isn't it, calling them inconsiderate, when the hate is surrounded by wanting to be up front. If enjoying your favorite artist(s) live is what you came to do, like a majority of people, then it shouldn't matter that you didn't get front row. You experienced something that other fans DIDN'T GET TO. These nectar fans got there early and secured a spot, to see their favorite artist hours and hours before he even got on. You don't just stroll up to the front because 'I wanted to see them up front' and that's the end of it. Have you ever been the first flock of people into the festival for the day? Ever seen people running? It's because it's a competition to get the best spot. You want special 'treatment' - buy VIP, spend more money. Don't think you're more important than another human because you listen to an artist more. It's not difficult. You find an open spot, that will accommodate you and your crew, enjoy the show and stop complaining that someone stood closer to the artist than you did."

Sure, there's a lot of Bassnectar attire in this photo just sitting around, but it's not 80 people... and it's not reflective of an entire fanbase. It's just a group of young assholes. Whether they realize it or not.  It's not just a Bassnectar problem."
bassnectar,3e0unj,percyllama,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:04 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a problem with assholes. Bassnectar has received so much success lately his fan base is growing and sooner or later a bunch of assholes come in and ruin everyone's time. Hopefully they learn to be respectful of other artists and people at festivals because new fans are gonna come in and be assholes too. Either learn festival etiquette or keep that shit on tour and I'll deal with it there.
bassnectar,3e0unj,Strapled,-6,Tue Jul 21 16:18:18 2015 UTC,"honestly its sad people even responded to that retarded live for live music article. it was writted by butthurt boscuit fans and all the quotes were straight from PT, aka the shittiest online community ever  who cares? front is for children. real heads rage out back"
bassnectar,3e0unj,backfromsolaris,4,Tue Jul 21 11:08:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, I would care if a large group of people were camped out in the closest area to the stage during multiple shows just for a completely different show later on, all while not even paying attention to the shows going on.  I mean, I was at ranch at forest pretty early this year on saturday but I got down to some Cheese so it was cool.  These guys just took up space and didn't create any fun vibes.  Your point about hanging in the back is fine, cause the back is definitely loads of fun, but what they did was still inconsiderate to others."
bassnectar,3e0unj,Strapled,0,Tue Jul 21 11:45:44 2015 UTC,i just think people are making WAY too big of a deal outta this. who fucking cares?  front is like trix. its for kids!

bassnectar,3e0unj,demb3k,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe bands will learn not to schedule nectar like 30 mins after they end. Biscuits and cheese did the same thing. You're just asking for flocks of idiots to camp in front of the stage for hours. Put Lorin on a different stage or put a couple hour break before nectar if a band is playing or something. This all depends on the location and the circumstance, but I've watched this all happen at cheese over the years at forest and it is always bothersome. I just get over it and am generally having too good of a time to let some scrubs get to me."

bassnectar,3e05sp,johnfb73,17,Mon Jul 20 23:01:12 2015 UTC,The BN crowd has definitely developed a reputation as a shitty fan-base over the past few years.   Situations like Camp Bisco and EFF '12 make people hate seeing bassnectar on a festival lineup.  Be respectful to others in the crowd and don't blow up anyone's spot.  It's not that hard to do
bassnectar,3e05sp,dowerks513,3,Mon Jul 20 23:16:39 2015 UTC,Was there something in particular that happened EFF 2012? Just curious. I hate that the BN crowd is developing such a shitty reputation.
bassnectar,3e05sp,bluefire1717,10,Mon Jul 20 23:28:12 2015 UTC,While string cheese was still playing bassheads started shoving there way to the front. Then started chanting bassnectar while string cheese still jamming on stage.   I was there and even after some fans were very disrespectful. I remember a group of 3 guys knocking over garbage cans and getting up in people's face when someone tried to stop them.
bassnectar,3e05sp,laggy2da,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:03 2015 UTC,ouch... that is quite shitty
bassnectar,3e05sp,dowerks513,5,Tue Jul 21 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"Same deal as at Camp Bisco. People are trying to enjoy the SCI show, but the crowd was swarmed with BN fans that decided to camp out for his set and disregard the fact that there was even a show going on. The BN fans were rude, blowing up people's spot, and totally oblivious to the fact that SCI was even on stage. The band members even shared a few remarks during and after the show  EDIT: Obviously not all BN fans are like this, but situations like this leave a bad impression for those who experienced the wrath of the more shitty fans."

bassnectar,3e05sp,CopedeGrace,14,Mon Jul 20 23:40:05 2015 UTC,"I think that a lot of his younger fans(21 or 20 and below) are probably making up the majority of this ""percentage""  I'm only 23 but I have changed a lot in 2 or 3 years, looking back i was a piece of shit and an idiot.  Give em time to grow into themselves and realize who they really are and who they dont want to be. This obviously doesnt excuse the behavior but all the info in that article did seem pretty run of mill for a fest/concert.

Some of these kids are so aimless and have no concept of ""reality"" outside of the festival/rave scene; they kind of just act like drugged up animals, with a sever lack of morals. Hopefully, with time, they learn from their mistakes."

bassnectar,3e05sp,sourgangbang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:11:49 2015 UTC,As a Basshead in that age range (19) I'm disgusted with how these people are acting. Have they not paid any attention to anything Lorin has ever said ever? Come on people....
bassnectar,3e05sp,ehsteve69,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:31 2015 UTC,I think you make a good point.  Many of these kids fall in the age range where they can afford to be blissfully ignorant in life.  Ages 22-24 is usually when you go out on your own and get punched in the mouth by life for the first time (for some).  It is liberating and is what it took for me to truly realize how much I have yet to learn as a person.
bassnectar,3e05sp,beepbeepgreenjeep420,10,Wed Jul 22 06:49:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly though this article is right, I sat in my seat all day watching the werks/jamming to manic focus/ and lovin the biscuits I had no problems. made alot of friends from other genres of music and hell my best friend is a HUGE biscuit fan. I enjoy jam bands more than nectar to be honest soley because of the crowd is much better and less stress. I love my tribe guys not only because thier music is on another level just everyone is so fucking happy and inviting at thier sets and shows. So im sitting in my seat during the rain delay and this kid (20-24) comes up behind me sits down. We start talking about the PL set and shit with my friend next to me and all of a sudden he goes biscuits should just cancel their set and have nectar play longer. My friend hears this and turns around is like comon man and goes on to say hes only here for the biscuits (he bought a saturday pass to see them) but he also enjoys nectar maybe not as much as some of us but he will still rage with me. This kid just blatently stops talking to us with the most annoyed look on his face, tDB end and he gets up pushes past us and just stands on the chair directly infront of us. This is the guy that made the varsity jackets with the bassdrop on the back, acted as if he was entitled because of that. It's just ""small"" stuff like this that makes the fanbase look so bad. SHOW RESPECT TO OTHER FANBASES AND RESPECT WILL BE SHOWN TOWARDS YOURS. WHEN THEY ARE ASSHOLES, KILL EM WITH KINDNESS...."
bassnectar,3e05sp,Umphreeze,7,Tue Jul 21 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"I couldn't tell you how many times I was told at Camp 12 that ""The Biscuits should just cancel their fucking sets and let Nectar play more.""  Like. I'm not a BN fan by any means but I've seen him a bunch and can always have some fun (in fact, his Summer Camp set in 2011 was one of my weekend highlights. Definitely a blast), but man so many of these kids are so disrespectful. The comments on his FB make me want to puke.  It's fucking Camp Bisco. Bassnectar would not even have a career in the greater festival scene if not for the Disco Biscuits. Show some respect. 90% of our fanbase hates Bassnectar. We show this by simply not showing up to his sets. We don't start shit.  You better believe that if Bassnectar threw a festival and the Biscuits played, our people wouldn't be starting shit the whole weekend. The Biscuits have spent a 20 year long career building a world where a festival like Camp Bisco can even exist, let alone curating and maintaining it for this long. Show some goddamn respect."

I toured with the dead in high school, phish, biscuits, ~30 sts9 shows and seen countless small bands/djs and I've never experienced a group of people, let alone fans, as obnoxious as nectar's.  there's no arguing this and the feeling is shared by everyone else except you guys.  it's not just pt, ""butthurt wooks"", or tDB fans... it's everybody.

bassnectar,3e05sp,EONS,2,Tue Jul 21 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on this? My first Bassnectar show was in 2008, and I've watched his fan base grow larger and larger over the years (and more passionate). I've always felt his fans are pretty chill, respectful people but maybe that's changed? I don't remember the last time I got close to the front at one of his shows so I'm not sure what goes down all the way up there. I guess it also depends on the venue and location.  Maybe it's time for the Bassnectar fan community to reflect on how we conduct ourselves at his shows."
bassnectar,3e05sp,RootBeerFaygo,7,Tue Jul 21 20:57:10 2015 UTC,"My experience at Red Rocks Saturday night says it best.  My friends and I (about 10 of us) have secured a nice block area (some in row below us, so basically like 4x4 with people doubled up on the ground and risers, standard.)  We got in very early and camped out our spot behind the soundboard. The closer Nectar's set came, the more people would try to force their way into our area. We did not get aggressive (I don't think we ever said a thing) but you're damn sure we muttered to ourselves and kept our eyes out and shoulders firm.  Eventually, the people next to us suddenly had multiplied. It was a few Bro looking dudes, and suddenly it was now 8 or so. We dealt with it, nobody was being shoved and everyone had enough space and decent views still (though it was still a bit frustrating at the time).  Flash forward. Lorin comes out, the set goes on, and we're all just vibrating and bouncing together. Eventually I get a tap on the shoulder from the most bro looking of the group that had encroached. He's holding out his hand, trying to give me molly.   Suffice it to say, we had a great fucking time and he was an awesomely chill and friendly dude.   Everyone wants their view. Their pure experience. Nobody wants interlopers. We just have to all accept that we are not unique in our goals at a Bassnectar show."
bassnectar,3e05sp,Mad_Hatter_Bot,2,Mon Jul 20 23:03:47 2015 UTC,You and I had very similar experiences (my first time seeing him live was at EF 15 though I've listened to him since a few months before divergent spec).  I was making plans in my head in case everyone pushed and it went all crazy. I was just trippin out at how many people were all around me and how the anxiousness was overwhelming. Then he starts the show and amazingly the whole place froze and gathered as much rage room as possible.   Ended up getting backed up as the set went on and danced my ass off. 10/10 would go again.
bassnectar,3e05sp,Strapled,6,Tue Jul 21 03:46:21 2015 UTC,"Was a few rows in front of the sound stage this year for his EF set (closest I've ever been). 15 min till the set is suppose to go on a group of about 9 people shove there way in between our group trying to get to their friends totem way up front. I'm sure you're also thinking that it's a giant surprise that there would be too many people to get up front 15 min before a show /s. They just decided to post up separating our group and taking the last amount of space that everyone in the area had to actually move and then I heard from the guy leading them ""just make people feel uncomfortable so they move"" what an unfortunate example of some of the fan base. Since then, so far only bisco, I'll stay far enough back where I can see but still move around since the EF set was the only time I've had to deal with shitty fans."

It isn't right to interrupt people enjoying music and it's unfortunate that some people got in the way of others. But i thought it was an awesome performance by bassnectar that was long awaited by many fans there. The DB played 4 or 5 times already and for those there to see bassnectar we only had that hour and fifteen minutes. It would have be enjoyable to have him play longer like PL got to. I had no problem finding a seat in the back waiting and watching the DB before bassnectar came on. And yes to everyone there, standing on the seats isn't necessary because if everyone just stands on the floor we can all see . ( amphitheater) Had a great time and for those who got into conflict, hopefully something was learned by that experience . Bisco was a great time , minor improvements could be made but the good people that attend make it amazing"

Those few that were like that were a very very small percentage. And for your fanbase to make us look like disrespectful kids is wrong. We have a great community that intertwines with other great. Some people there haven't been able to see him since he got canceled and hudson last year. So after 5 DB sets do you think people would be excited and ready to see bassnectar after that brief rain delay? It's not just about one artist and one fan group . It's about us all enjoying the moment.

bassnectar,3e05sp,EONS,6,Wed Jul 22 13:40:23 2015 UTC,no one is hating on the guy... in fact the article and most people have good things to say about him.  the problem is the children who think bc they've seen a dj 10 times they are king of the crowd and the mahl makes them finally feel special.  BN scene will get better as his audience matures and learn to handle their chems.  edit: autocorrect
bassnectar,3e05sp,WaitTilUSeeMyDick,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:49 2015 UTC,treat others the way you want to be treated.   That was from the tweet.  You want to be at the front for Bassnectar because you like that spot and like the experience there? That's totally fine. But there are plenty of people there who want to experience other artists the same way.
bassnectar,3e05sp,grandcrunkrailroad,3,Tue Jul 21 01:05:42 2015 UTC,Blame the festival imo.   It's so obvious that this is going to happen for popular sets. They need to make a pit and clear it for each act.   It's common sense. Something the people running Camp Bisco this year had none of.  The Bassheads taking up that row might have been polite for 6 hours and then gotten aggressive after dealing with the same shit for another 4. Idk. They're being dicks but..... the festival gave them the option to be.
bassnectar,3e05sp,YoungChuck,3,Tue Jul 21 01:20:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure someone from the Biscuits tweeted that they are considering clearing the pit between sets for next year.

They line up is awesome. And they are promising a much bigger and louder stage than last year. Plus, leaving and coming back is really easy. So if there's morning you want to spend exploring Kansas city or getting some amazing BBQ than you can do that. Tickets aren't to expensive. Unfortunately, there aren't one day passes. For me it's only a 4 hour drive so I definitely see it as worth it."
bassnectar,3e12yh,channel4newsman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you call home but I'm 12 hours from it and I'm driving up. On top of all the other bangers (snails, slander, party favor, datsik) Porter is playing and I have heard SOOO many good things about his worlds live show. The best part is that Lorin is playing an hour and 45 minutes, and he'll more than likely be unopposed on the smaller stage. It's a small upcoming festival so I don't expect the atmosphere to be crazy immersive like TW or Bisco or anything like that. But it is a camping fest which is a plus. The location by the river seems hella cool, and all the stuff I read about last year said that entry and exit was easy. You can come and go as you please, and it's right in the city. So if you're craving Taco Bell like a muhhfucka then you can go snag some!   Sorry for the wall of text but I hope I helped with your decision! If you decide to go, PM me and we will hook up for the nectar set."
bassnectar,3e12yh,BAEsshead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:02 2015 UTC,He's on the mainstage after borgeous and before snails. He will probably only play for an hour and a half. It usually takes 15 mins to get nectar set up.

I suggested taking out the foreground completley by cutting the guy out and the words and instead of having just a picture of lazer eyes he adds actual LED lights to his eyes, it would be a smaller totem and actually pretty thoughtful.

bassnectar,3dvj0w,ecro1992,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"Cheese fans complained about the same thing at the forest. Maybe we shouldn't assume that bassheads can do no wrong. Try putting yourself in their shoes. I'm sorry, but if I'm seeing my favorite artist I want to get down with everyone around me. It really kills the vibe if most of the people are just sitting and waiting for the next set instead of getting down to the music, especially when your up front where it's supposed to be wilder. It's not hard to understand where they are coming from, and it's annoying when all I see is people saying that the other group of fans are the ones that need to check themselves."
bassnectar,3dvj0w,Mad_Hatter_Bot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"Dude, thats not what im saying at all. Lorin is right when he says its a circlejerk of people spewing misinterpreted hate. People like to stir the pot because people like drama. We are all human, obviously we can and do, do wrong.  I completely understand where they are coming from, but that is a minuscule amount of people out of the actual entity that makes up the real bassheads. tDB fans and bassheads have been feuding for years!! This is nothing new!! Id like to think the people in this subreddit are mature enough to realize what is important, and would also like to think that we treat others with respect and care. I think its a waste of fucking breath to talk about this shit, because everywhere else is polluted with this completely negative shit. If you want to partake in the shit talking between fan bases go to facebook or the bisco sub. Id like to keep it real over here. Thats all im saying... No disrespect at all.  Its beating a dead fucking horse over it. There are shit heads in every fan base, and always have been and always will be. Its a big generalization and finger pointing at a whole group of tens of thousands, over a few people being rude and inexperienced. As the scene grows its going to bring in idiots that arent there for the right reason, and thats that. Whether its tDB  or Bassheads, we can generalize the other group all we want, but that is hyporitical. Same way that being racist over a small percentage of individuals is wrong! Acknowledging it only gives it more power!  Take a step back and do what you can do! Complaining about a few bad apples on social media accomplishes nothing, and frankly a waste of energy. We all need to play our part, and calling out fan bases on social media is NOT the way....  Once again no disrespect, and I dont understand why I was downvoted above. You can control what you let into your life and what you let affect your psyche. Dont let some disrespectful people alter your ideals at all of other people. You can control what you can control, so putting any energy towards dumb shit is just a waste imo. Much love..."

He definitely not the most respectful or deep guy in the game but he has had a ridiculous impact of the music industry (business and musically). He doesn't take himself or the shit he does too seriously and I think that's pretty uncommon in EDM.

bassnectar,3dv2pp,ubbitz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:09:31 2015 UTC,"Diplo is not anti-drugs. His business model depends on them.   Alcohol is a drug and he's admitted to drinking it. So please don't put him on a pedestal like he's anti drug. He just has to say that for media purposes.  If you're going to refer to his ""techno"" video it's such a fucked and twisted message.   Drugs didn't kill (and don't kill) the girl in that video. Unregulated drug markets do. Legitimate clean drugs don't kill nearly as much as tainted dirty ones."

bassnectar,3dv2pp,gonzobon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:05:46 2015 UTC,I'm interested in this ghost writer thing. I've heard about it a bit. How do you know when someone has a ghost producer/writer and who are they?
bassnectar,3dv2pp,CopedeGrace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:14:34 2015 UTC,I'd go look at the questions in his Reddit AMA that he didn't answer.  https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=diplo%20ghost%20writer  Unfortunately there is no way to confirm without most artists admitting it since there's lots of offline and person to person discussion that doesn't make it online.

bassnectar,3dv2pp,gonzobon,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"Diplo is definitely not anti-drugs.  He breathes oxygen. Oxygen is indeed a drug. I'm sure he's also ingested the marijuanas, drank some coffee, and maybe even had a sip of Coors Light at a cookout before. He is an awful person that endorses drugs and terrible twerking musics.  I hope you die, Diplo."
bassnectar,3dv2pp,BassLorin,0,Sun Jul 19 23:48:32 2015 UTC,I don't wish death upon him. But I think he's left a gnarly stain on Electronic music.

bassnectar,3dyd6m,Linguini_Fettuccine,3,Mon Jul 20 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"While I agree that he is a huge part of Camp Bisco, I think its wrong to say that its basically his own festival. Regardless of whether there are more people there to see him than the Biscuits, the Biscuits started the festival, and invite him to play every year, yet tons of bassheads continue to disrespect them and their fanbase.   I'm not calling you out for doing that. But I do think its important that we realize that it is not Lorins festival, its the Biscuits festival, and we owe them a lot of respect for bringing Lorin out every year for us to see"
bassnectar,3dyd6m,NoWorries13,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:37:08 2015 UTC,they bring lorin bc they NEED him and probly get him at a discounted homie price too. thats how you sell tickets and make a profit
bassnectar,3dyd6m,NoWorries13,3,Mon Jul 20 23:47:51 2015 UTC,"and that means that you don't pay respect to the guys who started the festival in the first place? They don't need him, they want him there, Lorin and Brownstein are homies. It's honestly not that hard to sell out a festival with EDM acts nowadays. If they really wanted to, they could book acts like Dillon Francis, 12th planet, Excision, Kaskade, Skrillex, Zedd etc. That kinda lineup honestly sells out. But they don't, especially this year, they booked a lot of small names.   I keep hearing about how the Biscuit fans just shit on bassheads, and I'm not saying thats not true, but people act as if that justifies their rude behavior. Why don't we actually try and spread the message Lorin promotes, be the bigger person, and respect all types of music even if its not your thing"
bassnectar,3dyd6m,KindCreations,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"no they need lorin. without lorin they do not sell half the tickets they ended up selling. tDB has a small fanbase. this is why Lorin plays their setbreak each and every single year on day 3, so more people get exposed to tDB  sorry but they quite literally need lorin  and yeah, i have zero respect for the greediest band in music"
bassnectar,3dyd6m,berodge,2,Tue Jul 21 11:05:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Biscuits fan but I feel the need to defend them here. So you're going to disrespect and talk shit on a band that throws a music festival and brings talent in since what '99? And they've toured for 20 years. You call them greedy when they host a food drive at Bisco? Plus, Marc founded HeadCount which if you aren't aware gets citizens registered to vote by going to concerts and festivals across the country  among other things.  Lorin is a partner in that along with some of the most respectable artists/bands of our generation.  You sound like a troll."

bassnectar,3dvcl9,Strapled,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:59:33 2015 UTC,Yea its 99% a Yookie - EEK Remix. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBqWhlq4nKQ . Same visuals and lyrics and same parts for some but overall def a remix of that track.

bassnectar,3doa94,EONS,5,Fri Jul 17 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"That would be incredible! It's a little hard to imagine since this isn't a particularly special event for Bassnectar, and he'd be bringing back a song he hasn't dropped in ages, but if it were to happen at all this would be the time.   Ellie Goulding has played the Bassnectar Remix at her lives show many times before (see here) , so I don't think it would take a whole lot of preparation aside from her simply being on stage. Fingers crossed!  I just moved to Seattle so I'll be there regardless! Let me know if anyone wants to meet up!  Also, when's the last time Lorin dropped Lights? Ultra 2013 I think?"
bassnectar,3doa94,campaigns,3,Sat Jul 18 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"Last time I remember was NYE 12/13  Hide&Seek > Lights > Butterfly > Delamure  But yes I believe it was played at Ultra '13, and I do not think since.   I don't think they've ever been at the same festival before, or same city at same time. Doesn't he try to use guests that are already there? I don't think it has ever been done live with Bassnectar there, so I feel like Monday's the night.  Would be too big a shame for so much fortune to go to waste."
bassnectar,3doa94,thereisdwarf,2,Sat Jul 18 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"If it happens, it would be her doing it live durning Nectars set.   That being said, I doubt it will happen. He usually only does live songs like that at special events (NYE, Red Rocks). But he did just so a song live at EF so who knows. Just don't get your hopes up!"
bassnectar,3doa94,DaRedBasshead,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:51:39 2015 UTC,"He usually only flies in guests for special events.

bassnectar,3dkp11,Fbulol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:34:22 2015 UTC,I think he's toned down on it lately because it was for so long

bassnectar,3dkp11,ben10103,5,Sun Jul 19 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"He doesn't drop it to often so it doesn't wear out. But FROGS has to be one of the most epic tracks he drops for him and the crowd, partly because its unreleased only to be heard at Live shows and videos. RIBBIT."

bassnectar,3dkp11,blelli,2,Fri Jul 17 03:45:49 2015 UTC,He's played Take You Down almost every time I've seen him
bassnectar,3diyjv,Coach_Louis,9,Thu Jul 16 17:26:17 2015 UTC,Sounds like Mudson V2. Just hope there is no torrential downpour causing rivers and lakes of mud. As long as Nectar plays its worth it hopefully?
bassnectar,3diyjv,ben10103,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:24 2015 UTC,Those mud rivers were so fucking fun. Only wish they were a bit more... conveniently timed. And that they didn't fuck over people's cars
bassnectar,3diyjv,Cowsap,3,Thu Jul 16 21:50:50 2015 UTC,I had friends that came up for Florida for Nectar and when it was announced he wasnt playing we were just to heart broken to stay. We left right as it was canceled and he tweeted the popo wouldnt let him play. We were stuck sitting in our car in the mud for 12 hours before we finally got pulled out :/
bassnectar,3diyjv,ben10103,3,Thu Jul 16 21:51:59 2015 UTC,I only got stuck for 6 :)

Waited in line forever for a shuttle bus, just to wait in another line out in the blistering sun for a tractor to pull me down a hill so I can pull all my gear up the hill to find a camping spot. Fucking rediculous."
bassnectar,3diyjv,phazyluck,3,Fri Jul 17 00:58:09 2015 UTC,"The being dropped off at the bottom of the mountain was probably the worst of it all, although it's hard to say what exactly is the worst thing about all this."
bassnectar,3diyjv,oosmeven,5,Fri Jul 17 12:26:48 2015 UTC,"Idk what youre making complaints in multiple posts for man, get over it. If you had bothered to look at the venue info at all or looked for feedback from peachfest goers on what to expect you might have been prepared. Dont complain because you didnt do your research. Bisco was fantstic, and given the insane zoo they had to manage I'd say the team pulled the event off pretty well."
bassnectar,3diyjv,Strapled,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:14:10 2015 UTC,haha i did my research and decided that no doubt hotel was the way to go  it amazes me that people dont look this shit up. i had a great bisco experience this year for the most part

bassnectar,3diyjv,biggP,2,Thu Jul 16 20:13:04 2015 UTC,Been having a great time besides the wait to get in all that. But it's all worth it in the end! Having wonderful time with friends! Can't wait for bassnectar! Wooooo
bassnectar,3diyjv,Benemy,3,Fri Jul 17 17:04:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I've heard it's been a train wreck thus far. Honestly any festival that has to cart or shuttle people from parking to camping sounds like a bad idea. There's just way too much that can go wrong and make the experience of just setting up camp a pain in the ass.   I hope that the weather fairs well and that the music makes it worth it.
bassnectar,3diyjv,rc_hammer17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"Hey Coach -- I'm not coming in until tomorrow (friends are there now setting up camp, lucky me?) but they just told me they were having a similar experience until they flagged down a guy on a quad and offered him 25 bucks to load up their stuff and drive them up the mtn. Give it a shot?"
bassnectar,3diyjv,rc_hammer17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Thought about it, I've spent enough time and money here, I just found a spot in the woods and set up, it's pretty rocky and slanty no matter where you are."

Unless he does something in the Bay Area (where he 2%#@%#@&6 LIVES) I will have to wait until Basslights/NYE and then fly probably cross country to do that run.  Always worth the special engagements, even if  I have to sell something to buy the plane ticket."
bassnectar,3di64z,ozark_candyman,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:54 2015 UTC,Man trust me....recently moved to Colorado i gave up almost 75% of all nectar festivals and Forest and Waka i was pretty butthurt. BUT seeing myself were i am at i lucked out on 3 day RR beyond that i am looking at Halloween and NYE. S/O college bassheads
bassnectar,3di64z,ehsteve69,6,Thu Jul 16 14:44:57 2015 UTC,I moved to europe for work and gave up 98% of all nectar ever. It was worth it :/

Some day I'll turn up for a NA show, but until then, I patiently await the next european vacation. Just a shame how so many people here complain about BN never being near them when they're at least on the correct side of the ocean.  Luckily, I took the inspiration from the music and message with me in transplanting myself."
bassnectar,3di64z,EONS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"I know Feed Me had a lot of touring in EU a couple years back, but what about other British Bass artists? Joker? Son of Kick? Tipper? Any of them do major EU touring?   They all do major American touring.AFAIK, they all either stay in their home turf, or tour in America. Not sure how often any of them do major EU tours, if ever really."
bassnectar,3di64z,thestrangestick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:27 2015 UTC,It's all about genre popularity. EDM/electronic is huge in the USA and the UK recently.   Source: English guy living in America.
bassnectar,3di64z,EONS,0,Thu Jul 16 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"That doesn't hold.   Trance and House are European powerhouses. The list of ""top DJ Mag DJs"" is almost exclusively European DJs who only come to the US for festivals (when's the last time Armin Van Buuren did touring here? at least 7 years).   I think it's just Bass music. EDM is popular everywhere, but Bass music doesn't seem to tour outside the US and UK."
bassnectar,3di64z,ehsteve69,2,Thu Jul 16 19:07:48 2015 UTC,"The popularity differences are striking and it certainly depends on the region and often just booking practices of certain venues.  I did see PL and BN last summer and have seen handfulls of other artists like Gramatik, Noisia, Odesza, etc. and know people like Downlink and Liquid Stranger semi-regularly tour the EU.  So, sure, there are still many opportunities, but you often have to seek them out and it is way more low key than the US. You're right about the steady beat varieties, which kind of makes bass music it's own niche crowd, which I think can be particularly cool. Of course, it means the opportunities are few and far between and often absent of familiar elements, like light rigs and sound systems."
bassnectar,3di64z,EONS,2,Thu Jul 16 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I forgot that Bassnectar has done European Vacations more than I thought.   7 shows last year, half festivals and the other half look like venues."
bassnectar,3di64z,thestrangestick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I meant bass music. Thanks for being pedantic though, lol. I think we are on the same wavelength really."

bassnectar,3dekim,Benemy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:32 2015 UTC,I know which one you're talking about. I think that was a fan-made poster. Here is the 2012 NYE poster that's on bassnectar.net

bassnectar,3dekim,JustB_ill,2,Thu Jul 16 16:00:23 2015 UTC,Yeah the NYE  posters aren't very consistent. Like that beehive poster was for the 2011 show but it says NYE 2012 on it. If it didn't say 2011 on there I would have assumed it was for the 2012 show. There's a couple other posters/prints like that and I don't understand why they don't just put the dates of the shows on every single one.
bassnectar,3dekim,ShipThaRipperIVXX,2,Thu Jul 16 16:17:42 2015 UTC,I think people make NYE dates really confusing for no reason. The year you put on the poster shouldn't be the following year. its New Years EVE. Not new years DAY.  You and I see eye to eye on that one...

bassnectar,3d9e2w,bassubaru808,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just used a website that would produce it quickly. I started looking into setting it up myself, but the instructions were a little over my head and I knew it would turn in to a frustrating day long process to get it to work.  I plugged a couple in to another site, but it says they can take up to a week to ""wake up"", so I'm still waiting on those."
bassnectar,3da6px,dgio0426,5,Tue Jul 14 18:23:42 2015 UTC,exactly where in his website? do you have the link? EDIT: OMYGODD HE REPLIED TO MY QUESTION!!!! A THREE PARAGRAPH REPLY!!!!!! brb ventilating

As a resident of philadelphia, I've seen the people who go to MIA. One of my favorite parts of a nectar show is sharing it with fellow bassheads! I've considered buying a ticket, but I think I'll wait until last minute to see who else is playing that day. Also Maybe there will be people trying to get rid of their tickets cheap last minute."
bassnectar,3d76yz,charg0n,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:29:41 2015 UTC,"I've been to MIA, and live about 5 minutes from the Art Museum here. I'm really worried about this honestly. Obviously, I can't miss Lorin making a stop 5 minutes from home. However, last time I was there, they put deadmau5 on this shitty side stage, and the audio quality sucked throughout his set. Plagued with technical difficulties.   If they do this to Bassnectar, which they will, I'm going to be livid. Fingers crossed the set works out well for MIA, because I don't think they know how to handle what he's bringing."

bassnectar,3d5f6v,iamoz,5,Mon Jul 13 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"I was just listening to this, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1SGhKY-I9U  Never seen that shit before, but if fucking amazing. Honestly, 2011 was fucking insane that year. Snowball, Hangout (late night 2.5 hour set, only year they did that), Bonnaroo, Basslights(?) ATL, and first year of Smashville NYE. Divergent Spectrum came out, and everything was just so raw and on point.  2011 was such a great year..."
bassnectar,3d5f6v,taelor,6,Mon Jul 13 22:30:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, I wholeheartedly agree. 2011 was a legendary music for bassnectar and bass music as a whole. The scene wasn't crazy big and saturated with a bunch of people there for the scene, bassnectar was touring like NONSTOP and that glorious album we all know and love dropped...I miss 2010-2011"

bassnectar,3d5f6v,SpectacularRainbows,3,Mon Jul 13 22:39:39 2015 UTC,"Damn, I think I'm the only one who doesn't get this song.  The drop to me sounds like farts and I love dubstep."
bassnectar,3d5f6v,Smokey_Bera,3,Tue Jul 14 00:03:43 2015 UTC,I respect your opinion and got nothing but love. But daaamn man. I love this song. The drop after the long build up is so energetic it always gets me going.
bassnectar,3d5f6v,taelor,2,Tue Jul 14 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"I mean this is totally it. when the crowd heard this, everyone knew it was time to get down, get weird show off your moves. It was the marching call, the battle hymn."
bassnectar,3d5f6v,too_old_still_party,2,Tue Jul 14 04:25:27 2015 UTC,"lol, I'm not a fan of Basshead either, it's one I always skip when it pops up on my Pandora or something."

bassnectar,3d5f6v,Bustin_Chiffarobe,2,Tue Jul 14 02:20:19 2015 UTC,"I can  totally understand that. But also some songs such as this are just so different when you hear them in a live setting. Then when you to them anytime after seeing it live, the feelings of that time you heard it live are always there. Just a thought to why some people like it so much"
bassnectar,3d5f6v,dinglemelonski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:15:01 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree, there is nothing like him mixing Basshead into his set. You'd know its about to go down when you hear the intro and for the next drop everyone goes nuts. Especially when Timestretch first came out, the chills man. His bangers have obviously evolved into what we now know as The Matrix, What, Generate, etc.. Which is why I feel some people find Basshead a bit stale as a single track but nothing will ever beat that first time hearing Basshead at one of his shows. Blows minds."

bassnectar,3d4ssr,djdonknotts,5,Mon Jul 13 15:20:19 2015 UTC,He doesn't have his computers in every shot. And he doesn't do it every time. But I think one he had the Guetta meme in it. Killed me.

bassnectar,3d4ssr,Smokey_Bera,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:07 2015 UTC,Not sure where it is but he had Will Ferrel from Blades of Glory in a funny pose once.
bassnectar,3d4ssr,bvsshevd,2,Mon Jul 13 15:20:31 2015 UTC,Lmao correct me if I'm wrong but he had the David Guetta K hole pic one time

bassnectar,3d4ssr,downwiththerobotbass,2,Mon Jul 13 19:08:06 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they photoshop it in after the pic is taken. I could be wrong though. That'd be hilarious if he was throwing those up.

It will be worth the journey I promise, my only complaint was that the stages are tooo far away from each other. The stage where nectar was playing last year was a solid 20 minutes walk from the main stage. If walking isnt a problem for you then you should totally go for it!"
bassnectar,3d58su,EONS,2,Mon Jul 13 17:39:54 2015 UTC,"This is everyone's complaint. The festival is notoriously spread out.   So much so, someone got famously lost in the woods there.   Did I mention he wasn't found for four days? And he was still naked?"
bassnectar,3d58su,matirz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:16:13 2015 UTC,Cool thank you for your input! Walking isn't a big deal to me as much as who else is playing that day. Hopefully it works out!

bassnectar,3d58su,theflirtystoner,3,Tue Jul 14 19:57:07 2015 UTC,I don't trust bands in town for festivals because it's also saying he plays Friday of Lolla. I think they just always put the first day of the festival for artists that are playing that festival.
bassnectar,3d58su,shreknow91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:39:17 2015 UTC,I saw this same info and Im wondering if I should rely on it to buy a Fri Single day. Last year the single day tickets sold out before they even released the schedule. Right now they seem to only be selling Friday single day tickets. I dunno if that means Sat and Sun are already sold out or what.

bassnectar,3cygd4,iFUBAR,10,Sat Jul 11 22:57:03 2015 UTC,Did anyone see Amon Tobin's ISAM production a couple years ago? Incredible stuff!

bassnectar,3ctq9j,mau5head87,2,Sat Jul 11 05:48:53 2015 UTC,"yeah carmack is trap and future bass. Lorin has been dropping A LOT of trap lately. and he really kills it every time.   Speakerbox, Sideways, Now, Vava Voom, Freestyle, Feeling Good are all trap. that unreleased track everyone has been talking about that's he's been dropping show after show recently is also trap"
bassnectar,3ctq9j,EONS,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"That's funny. I have a friend who would say some of those are his favorite songs and he also says he hates trap.   It still feels like a very liquid, borred term, and almost a misnomer by now. All I can really infer is that the definition for ""trap"" just requires they used 808s. I mean.... someone needs to clarify it. Things that people say are trap, to me, all also tend to have pauses, throbbing 808s, and drops. BPM varies (some of the songs you listed go as high as like 178 bpm), sometimes vocals, sometimes rap, sometimes none.   Donno. I hate the term and want something better or more defined I guess. Although, hey, maybe drug traps these days really do listen to Zed's Dead and UZ. I mean, they plaed 808 Track in Jesse's meth den on Breaking Bad....."
bassnectar,3ctq9j,mau5head87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:18:08 2015 UTC,"""Trap music incorporates an extensive use of multi-layered hard-lined and melodic synthesizers; crisp, grimy and rhythmic snares; deep 808 sub-bass kick drums or heavy sub-bass lines; double-time, triple-time and similarly divided hi-hats; and a cinematic and symphonic utilization of string, brass and keyboard instruments creating an overall dark, harsh, grim and bleak atmosphere for the listener. The speed of a typical trap beat has a BPM of 140.""  The sound really originated in the early 90s with primarly southern rappers such as T.I., Young Jeezy, UGK, 8Ball & MJG, & Three 6 Mafia. I think trap in an EDM sense is incorporating the style of instrumental and adding a EDM twist to it, but the signature 808s and rapid hi-hat and snare hits are always there.   Of the Bassnectar tracks I listed, not 100% of the track is trap because Lorin slows it down in between or adds dubstep, dub, downtempo etc in as well, incorporating multiple different styles. I guess it's better to say those tracks contain elements of Trap.  To give you a great example, Lorin re-edited Vava Voom to completely turn it into trap with the ""Bassnectar Remix"":  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INdwkWtFPZ4"

bassnectar,3ctq9j,seviek,4,Fri Jul 10 23:23:56 2015 UTC,Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath.
bassnectar,3ctq9j,sou-ght,4,Fri Jul 10 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"Its kinda weird, Bassnectar is the heaviest artist I listen to while everything else is less heavy. Although, since I fell in love with Bassnectar I almost exclusively listen to broken beat music.  I recently put a ton of Blue Sky Black Death (and associated compilations) on my phone and been bumping to that. Here are couple of my faves:  Blue Sky Black Death - Valley Of Kings (Instrumental)  Blue Sky Black Death - Medusa"
bassnectar,3ctq9j,seviek,2,Fri Jul 10 19:00:22 2015 UTC,This is good stuff.
bassnectar,3ctq9j,w0oster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:23:28 2015 UTC,Glad you enjoyed it!   Ps. I really liked this thread. Great way to connect with bassheads and hear what you all are listening too!
bassnectar,3ctq9j,DaRedBasshead,5,Sat Jul 11 23:39:16 2015 UTC,Bleep Bloop &amp; Zeke Beats - Mars Attacks Mr. Carmack - Reference (II) / lovetakestwo Action Bronson - A light in the Addict  Emanciptor - Jet Stream Bluetech - Waiting for Initiation  Just a few off the top of my head. Tried to keep it diverse lol
bassnectar,3ctq9j,w0oster,3,Fri Jul 10 19:14:09 2015 UTC,Bleep Bloop is that alien music
bassnectar,3ctq9j,wa_fuls,2,Fri Jul 10 23:00:17 2015 UTC,I just heard Baby Blue by Action Bronson and Chance and I fucking loved it. He's got a unique flow in the few songs I've heard. Do you have any other songs by him that you'd suggest?
bassnectar,3ctq9j,Benemy,3,Sat Jul 11 07:50:33 2015 UTC,"Nice! Mr Wonderful is a proper album. I'd also check out Falconry on that CD...even though Mayhem Lauren steals that song lol  I'd also check out anything on Blue Chips 1/2, Pepe Lopez, Barry Horowitz, Shiraz. His mixtapes have some gold if you dig through em :)"
bassnectar,3ctq9j,EONS,5,Sat Jul 11 18:10:10 2015 UTC,Turnstile - Nonstop Feeling. the whole album is godlike if your into some funk/hardcore
bassnectar,3ctq9j,EONS,3,Fri Jul 10 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"Bonobo-1009  Bonobo isn't very bass heavy, but he produces incredible dance-y downtempo songs. Easily one of my favorite producers, aside from Lorin obviously. I'd say his music is similar to that of Tycho.   Gladkill makes some really pretty music. That's the best way I can describe it. Pretty dubstep/trap.  Gladkill-Return to Form Gladkill-Just A Thought Gladkill-Good Ones Go"
bassnectar,3ctq9j,seviek,7,Fri Jul 10 19:23:05 2015 UTC,"If you don't know about it, there's a thing called Boiler Room, where DJs do intimate small setting live sets that get broadcast out.  Bonobo has done a few of them, here's one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUzY3zc9vs8"
bassnectar,3ctq9j,Benemy,2,Sat Jul 11 01:29:59 2015 UTC,RL Grime's Boiler Room set is amazing if you haven't heard it. I really like how he mixes.

bassnectar,3ctq9j,Manhattan_24,5,Fri Jul 10 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"No problem, Bonobo is the shit. If you ever get the chance to see his live band DO IT, one of the best shows I've ever seen. Very chill but so god damned groovy.   Here's a couple other Bonobo tracks I love Antenna Recurring"
bassnectar,3ctq9j,PVRKY,2,Fri Jul 10 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"If you like Bonobo you might also like Tycho. My favorite track is called ""Dictaphone's Lament"". Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nCtPJUyolE  I've been thinking lately that this track would be SO DOPE if it was like, bassnectar-ified."

bassnectar,3ctq9j,EONS,5,Fri Jul 10 21:15:08 2015 UTC,"Woah, an Eskmo song I like.   Man, maybe it was the acid and the coincidence of rain, but his set at Red Rocks was just.... fucking weird as shit to me. It felt like a raindance."
bassnectar,3ctq9j,Lostmypants69,5,Sat Jul 11 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"I was tripping with some friends at the park few weeks back. We were about a mile and a half into a trail when it started raining. It was really really intense to me, borderline terrifying. Albeit this was the most L I had done before, it just really bugged me out.. All that being said, rain is intense while tripping, and shows are hella intense while tripping. I don't think I could trip at a show in the rain. That's just a bit too much lol."
bassnectar,3ctq9j,ubbitz,3,Sat Jul 11 08:21:36 2015 UTC,"I have limited experience with acid. I've only ever tripped at shows, actually. Almost exclusively Bassnectar, too.   That being said, on Sunday during ESKMO while the rain began and my friends all scrambled to get their ponchos, jackets, or other on, I just chilled the fuck out, I was about 15 min past peaking, and I was super entranced by the moss on the rocks behind stage. Had really serious color shifting going on. I was already standing, and I was so at peace with the rain. That being said, it just felt like the dude was doing a raindance. It didn't seem like music to me, at the time at least."
bassnectar,3ctq9j,evsDEAD,3,Sat Jul 11 10:57:53 2015 UTC,"Nice, I loved this track at EF. I think he might have played it at RR as well. Great find!"
bassnectar,3ctq9j,dcu5001,3,Fri Jul 10 21:34:24 2015 UTC,The best thing I heard from EF (wasn't there and haven't been able to listen to the whole set) was his remix of Street by NGHTMRE. By far my favorite track by NGHTMRE and it was such a shock to me when he dropped it.
bassnectar,3ctq9j,bpo21,4,Fri Jul 10 21:57:54 2015 UTC,Pretty Lights - I Can See it in Your Face
bassnectar,3ctq9j,Discount_Dracula,2,Fri Jul 10 23:05:02 2015 UTC,"This is my rock-solid, all-time, never-changing favorite song from PL. He has so much fucking music, but no matter how much I listen to, it just doesn't get better than this for me. That roaring-twenties sounding trumpet sample he does right before bringing the wubz back in always gets me moving."
bassnectar,3ctq9j,lfergy,3,Sat Jul 11 07:55:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. If I'm listening to PL there's a good chance this song is getting played.

bassnectar,3cojgq,thereisdwarf,6,Thu Jul 16 17:11:13 2015 UTC,It's just a rumor. I'd imagine that radius clause and Lollapalooza will get in the way.
bassnectar,3cojgq,posermobile1991,4,Thu Jul 9 16:34:36 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Skrillex played Lolla last year as a headliner, and then played a show at Navy Pier half way thru October, so it is a possibility still. I know there is the radius clause and such, but Skrillex found a work around for it, so it may be possible."
bassnectar,3cojgq,ecro1992,3,Thu Jul 9 21:21:23 2015 UTC,Radius clause just means he cant ANNOUNCE any shows in the area until after lolla. Thats why he didn't announce halloween last year until after he played north coast.
bassnectar,3cojgq,kayschwa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Yea, but Lollapalooza is really strict where they usually dont let headliners play within a certain distance for something like 3 months after the festival. Not exactly sure how it works, but Lolla is very very strict about their headliners and radius clauses and not allowing other shows within a certain time frame and distance. We shall see tho."
bassnectar,3cojgq,ecro1992,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:36:23 2015 UTC,Yeah but its almost 3 months after lolla....skrillex played navy pier like a little over 2 months after lolla. I don't think it'll be that big of a deal besides not being able to announce it until afterward. This is still all rumors and speculation though so it might  just not happen because it was never gonna happen. We'll never really know I guess. Fingers crossed
bassnectar,3cojgq,kayschwa,3,Sun Jul 12 21:44:28 2015 UTC,Dude - that... would...be... cold... maybe.  Outdoor concerts in Chicago in October - let alone the end of October.  I guess it would allow for us all to wear heavier costumes for once without dying.

bassnectar,3cmeo9,TheRolandDeschain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:03:01 2015 UTC,I've been hearing from people who have seen some of his more recent shows that he is starting to trend towards this kind of style?
bassnectar,3cmeo9,brandinni,4,Thu Jul 9 14:29:42 2015 UTC,This mixtape reminded me a lot of the style of his set at Electric Forest.
bassnectar,3cmeo9,lfergy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:16 2015 UTC,I thought the exact same thing
bassnectar,3cmeo9,insatiablesloth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"Let's not let confirmation bias interfere here when a very simple explanation is available:   He is playing sets based off of his red rocks music, which he said is what he wanted to use to base his festival season on. His red rocks music was composed as Into the Sun, and we know the rest. It was a choice. The music stands on its own fine imo.   And let's also not forget, he is mixing songs into his Into the Sun stuff heavily. Very heavily. Even the Forest set. Into the Sun was mixed very heavily and differently than we've heard before, and then vocals mixed in (speaking of, I've never heard those either, does anyone know what they were?)."

bassnectar,3cmeo9,thereisdwarf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:33 2015 UTC,I hope not. I did notice at forest that I felt he played a few songs out too long without transitioning but not like the mixtape which pretty much goes from one song to another with very little transitioning

bassnectar,3cmeo9,Bustin_Chiffarobe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:39:39 2015 UTC,Seems like that happened a lot in the last mixtape too. Plenty of abrupt stops. makes me think that the trend is more about giving each song its due and not trying to make the music flow together in some cohesive way when some of the tracks just don't lend themselves to that.
bassnectar,3cmeo9,Smoke_Stack707,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:08:45 2015 UTC,I agree. I guess since the mixtape was made to play every song out in its entirety so it's different but that's not what I want to hear live. His transitions and mixing ability is too good not to use in his mixes

bassnectar,3cmeo9,EONS,3,Thu Jul 9 15:32:23 2015 UTC,I love the new album. His new tracks are stellar and his reimagining of the classics are dope too. However the mixtape isn't up to his standards. If you listen to immersive one or two or freestyle he mixes everything really really well. You just don't have that on mixtape 13. That isn't to say I don't like it. I think it's good just not up to his usual standards.
bassnectar,3cmeo9,MajicMarker13,3,Thu Jul 9 12:16:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with the general vibe of the comments - fuckin good-ass music, sweet fucking moments in songs, but yeah, the transitions coulda been cooler. I've been listening to Immersive Mixtapes and I love them so much! They flow soooo well and each song just pours into the next one beautifully. Not to mention that really soft and beautiful segment near the end(ish) of IM1 where that chick is like ""I don't wanna go back"". Holy shitttttt"
bassnectar,3cmeo9,EONS,4,Fri Jul 10 19:21:27 2015 UTC,Everyone should've heeded his advice and waited for the listening party. I hope you have learned your lessons for the next one (due later this year).

bassnectar,3cmeo9,biotwist,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"It certainly wasn't the kind of mix that makes you run to your computer and try to deduce what tracks are being played. I think the mixtape would have had a bigger impact if it came out prior to the album and the fact that the Double Oreo remix can be found online means there's nothing unique about the mixtape; no gem you keep rewinding to listen to over and over. The album is so good that I'm not really complaining though. Rather than being its own unique thing, M13 is just icing on the cake."
bassnectar,3cmeo9,Smoke_Stack707,4,Fri Jul 10 00:06:16 2015 UTC,"<3 I think more people need to read that interview and hear this message. I loved Into The Sun honestly, but honestly I find it hard to view any one song of Lorin's as a singular happening because his bread and butter is his live performances, in which the immersive music truly takes form."
bassnectar,3cmeo9,biotwist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:42:02 2015 UTC,but there was soo much new shit on there that he just decided to make it an album so we could have each individual songs and remixes (Lo is the shit).    this.

bassnectar,3clzx9,DaRedBasshead,2,Fri Jul 10 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"Very well then, don't see why not! :D  Hey man, before I start dishing out on the tips etc, just wanted to touch base. I'm an Ableton user and I made the mix in Ableton, I think it gives a lot more freedom than say Serato or Traktor, but that's just my 2 cents.  The way I mix songs is by looking at intros, outros, and breakdowns. This is what you'll be using most of the time to transition from song to song. I try and use songs with identical BPMs, but if they one song is like 150 and one is 140, I try and play them both at 145 instead of playing one at 140 and then ramping it up to 150. I feel like a 5 bpm shift is much less noticeable.  But back to song selection, I just look at the parts of the songs that aren't so busy; just like one or two instruments. So for like my Into the Sun into the Future transition, I picked Into the Sun's intro melody to transition, that little beautiful piano falling melody thing. It easily loops and is not busy at all so it'd be easy to mix into something. So the next step is to find a piece of a song that I can loop while mixing/cross fading the two. To mix the songs, it's like MacGyvering it. You have some key tools though; the crossfader helps control volume of the songs crudely and it's an easy transition. But sometimes pieces of songs will clash, so that's when you start EQing things. For a lot of my transitions, I will slowly take the bass out of the first song and then start slowly introducing the bass of the second song. Another thing I often do is take the bassline of the second song and use it IN the breakdown of the first song (so I've EQed the bass out of the first song, and then EQed the highs out of the second). Then I continue lowering the volume of the first song and then bringing in the highs of the second. I hope that wasn't too confusing, man.  As for finding songs that go well together, it's a mix of getting lucky and having a good memory. Sometimes I have ideas instantly and those moments are awesome. Other times I'm left playing the loop I want to mix out of over and over while looking over a catalog of songs. I usually have an idea of what KIND of song I want to mix into though, like do I want a heavy dubstep drop or do I need a slowly evolving intro? Then I will use BPMs and song keys to help narrow things down. The BPMs and keys don't always have to match, though. Sometimes I will have a less rhythmic loop or clip playing (like the Chasing Heaven into Into the Sun transition) where I can ramp up the bpm from 130 to 160 and it not be too jarring. I hate doing that though.  Beatport is awesome for finding BPMs and keys, they have it for all the songs listed. I usually have it open when I'm working on my mixes.  I don't really know what else to say, but I hope you can find something valuable in this wall of text. If you want to clarify anything or if you have any other questions, feel free to shoot em my way in a response."

bassnectar,3clzx9,spiffyweb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:04:38 2015 UTC,"hey man, thanks for the feedback. about the 808s and bass, is it every single one? If so, then it's definitely an EQ thing when I exported it :'( There are 2 songs in the mix that I had to settle for a 128kbps rip, and I myself thought the bass sounded a little distorted with those songs, but if it's every one then it's something I didn't notice. Thanks for the heads up!  As for your first question, for this mix specifically, I didn't use my MIDI controllers, just plain old mouse and keyboard + a lot of automation. I do have a MIDI setup that I would use for a live performance and I could very easily recreate the mix live, but for a mixtape I wanted the parameters and transitions to be perfect down to a T.  Ableton is pretty confusing but once you get the hang of it, the possibilities are endless! For my mixes, I start with 4 audio tracks. Ableton gives you a crossfader that you can assign your tracks to, so I assign 2 tracks to ""A"" and 2 tracks to ""B."" So I could have a song, plus some vocals on A an then a song and some vocals on B etc. etc. Since my live setup includes an APC Mini to launch clips and it has a 8x8 grid, I also add 4 other audio tracks so I can launch one shots or ghost clips etc.   For EQing and what not, I use an M Audio X Session which is a totally randomly controller I stumbled upon one day but is perfect for what I needed. It has 12 knobs, 4 faders, and a crossfader. So 3 of each knob is used to EQ each of those 4 audio tracks assigned to A and B.   For effects, until I get save up to a Novation LaunchControl, I currently am using a Korg NanoKontrol for its 8 knobs.   Hope that gives you an idea of how you can use Ableton for mixes/live performances. When I produce in it, I just use a MIDI keyboard and that's about it haha."
bassnectar,3clzx9,DaRedBasshead,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"hell yeah that's bad ass man. i'll definitely look into ableton again once i get some free time. i have a midi keyboard and also have a Maschine MK2, which I have seen people map to midi on ableton to launch clips, so I will need to do some customizing. i've seen people do some really cool things on youtube with the novation launchpad as well. seems like you would probably dig /r/edmproduction , if you haven't already checked it out  also you did a great job with the vocal samples over the tracks, very similar vibe to what Lorin does live. props!  going back to the bass feedback thing, i really hear it throughout the entire mix. definitely more noticeable in some parts over others (just going back to listen, can definitely hear it throughout ""into the sun""---and compared to the original version to make sure it wasn't my headphones). but honestly I only hear it when I'm listening on my Bose noise canceling headphones. when i listen over my logitech speakers, can't pick it up. so pretty small EQ issue overall I think"

I suppose, in the end, as long as Bassnectar can bring in what he wants, the venue is nearly irrelevant. I'll be damned if we can go backwards from 360 though.

Bridgestone is one of the 4 most technologically advanced arenas in America, and only one other arena is better and bigger (Amalie in Tampa). The Legacy Arena in Birmingham is almost 60 years old with little to no serious renovations.   Not to mention Alabama is even farther from any possible average point, and in yet another incredibly socially conservative state with even more vicious police.  I'd like to see even one reason why they chose this, if it comes to pass.   That being said, I heard Glitch Mob would be there for NYE almost 2 months ago, so...."

He plays everywhere.   He tweeted ""a space ship big enough to fit everyone in"". The BJCC is big. I've been and I've never been viciously attacked by a cop.   Speaking of cops. Where is that even coming from homie? Are you from Alabama? Do you frequently have run-ins with police in the state? If not, how would you even know what you're basing this stuff on? I live in Alabama and the cops in my area, as well as any I've interacted with in Birmingham, are fine. They probably won't take kindly to drugs but guess what... Lorin doesn't even take kindly to drug use.   Yeah there's a bunch of racist, ignorant, fucks in the south. But the most racist person I've ever met in my life was in Columbus, Ohio. Racism and ignorance is country-wide. It's ridiculous to act so holier than thou about a concert happening in a state that you don't wanna travel to.  He plays everywhere, and he's got love for every region he visits. If he has a thing for getting down with the dirty south on NYE then it's his show and his call.

The reality is, despite his public statements against the use, he is FULLY aware of how indelible drug use is to his fanbase and culture. He's not stupid. Holding a huge, once a year extravaganza in the middle of a deep red, right wing conservative state with higher than average arrest rates and LIFE IN PRISON for an ounce of marijuana?  There's a difference between making a tour stop there (once, ever?) and holding a cherished, traditional once a year event there. A huge difference. It's the difference between people traveling all across the country (usually with drugs), and travelling across a state or county line or two.    I appreciate your concern for sensitivity and political correctness, but it is flat out irresponsible to take 15,000 bassheads who are guaranteed to be bringing and using mass quantities of drugs into one of the most vicious and reprehensible justice systems in America.

Keep in mind some big names will only cut deals if their high standards are met, and that other BIGGER names will literally play for free for the right event or cause and its just a mess no matter how you slice it.

Anyways it makes for a pretty cool live show experience and since it seems like they will be opening for 360 and they also confirmed earlier this year that they were going to be bringing the blade to all shows this year, I'm curious and excited to see how they would set it up for the 360 stage."

But for me, when I first saw it at that forest set while dancing my ass off to some crazy good live beats with my crew, it created a real connection between the crowd and them.  Lots of people want to see the DJ spin their knobs and shit (nectar at the Pageant was intimate as fuck and I loved it for that), so they sort of addressed that desire by sprucing it up a bit to bridge the gap between audience and artist(s), creating a more substantial live experience.  Definitely helps if you dig their style, too, so to each their own!"
bassnectar,3cla6j,yakkinhippies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:54:31 2015 UTC,Right on I can see that too. And yes Nectar at the Pageant was sick af.... except I got kicked out halfway through ;-;
bassnectar,3cla6j,Pantsguy92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:12:08 2015 UTC,Whaaaaat?  Were you recording with a device?  Had a guy next to me almost get booted for this reason.
bassnectar,3cla6j,2ndOFakind,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:22:17 2015 UTC,I was front row on the balcony and I kept pulling my phone out to try to get my friend up there with me and the security guard thought I was going to drop it over the railing onto the people below. He asked me not to hold it over the railing which was fair enough then when Nectar came out I pulled it out to record the intro and he caught me and made me move a row back. My whole crew and flag were in the front so I moved back up later and he came back through an hr or so later and grabbed me and kicked me out no questions asked... I was so pissed because I drove from Iowa.
bassnectar,3cla6j,Smalltownlegend,5,Fri Jul 10 04:43:20 2015 UTC,I would really do anything to see OTT open up for Bassnectar...

Their music is good listening music, but it just doesn't make me lose touch. You know? Destoid, although lacking in material, would be an excellent opener.  (Also excision as a solo act has def lost its p-zazz)"
bassnectar,3cla6j,ben10103,2,Thu Jul 9 22:08:01 2015 UTC,"I saw them at forest and really loved the show, tons of energy in that pit.

bassnectar,3cla6j,ben10103,2,Wed Jul 8 20:20:18 2015 UTC,"With you on that, especially G Jones and Joker night 1 of RR that was awesomeee. Only exception IMO is chromeo from Basslights"
bassnectar,3cla6j,EONS,6,Thu Jul 9 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"dude that chromeo set, no joke was the worst set ive ever seen in my life. and ive seen a LOT of music. chromeo had NO IDEA who they were playing a show for. then when they realized nobody was dancing they just started playing the shittiest trap music. i love trap, but the shit they were playing was crap"
bassnectar,3cla6j,EONS,2,Thu Jul 9 11:28:07 2015 UTC,"so true chromeo was wack and just didn't fit. but don't forget benga and rusko openers! especially rusko, by far the best opener i've seen for lorin"

bassnectar,3cla6j,EONS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:05:53 2015 UTC,Gladkill->GrizMatik (griz then grizmatik together then gramatik) was my favorite openers to date for Nectar. That was at my first Nectar show 11/15/12 Umass Amherst Mullins Center :). Still top 3 nectar set for me also
bassnectar,3cla6j,Jisher,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:39:27 2015 UTC,I feel like Son of Kick was the best I've seen in the last few years.
bassnectar,3cla6j,backfromsolaris,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:18:19 2015 UTC,"Really? I saw him three times during the Nvsb tour and he never really impressed me. Played VERY similar sets all three times. I will say he was a lot better at Red Rocks though. I'm not into hip hop or rap so that might be why, but Benga was my favorite opener. Talking aside, that dude went hard"
bassnectar,3cla6j,dankgeebs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"His tour openers always play basically the same set.   Son of Kick? Rap? I mean, he's associated with a Dubstep/Hiphop group from London called Foreign Beggars, but he's just Electro-step afaik.   The Red rocks openers were pretty disappointing overall. G-Jones went on so early for night one that most people probably didn't even see him. Joker's computer broke and he had to livemix everything with mp3s (impressive, but not a good set). Benga was ok, but felt like he was trying to play a prom or something.   Son of Kick was the best, followed by Nightmares on Wax. imo"
bassnectar,3cla6j,backfromsolaris,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:55:21 2015 UTC,During hiws NvsB sets he played Drake and a ton of other really lame shit... guess I just got a bad first impression.
bassnectar,3cla6j,dankgeebs,4,Fri Jul 10 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"Id rather have lot of people rather than Glitch Mob, but thats just me : /  G Jones and tipper were more than incredible openers imo. But then again i've never really gotten into Glitch Mob too much, nor have I seen them live, so I could be wrong."
bassnectar,3cla6j,backfromsolaris,4,Wed Jul 8 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"The only complaints I've ever heard regarding Glitch Mob were a lack of diversity in long sets. As an opener, that should be irrelevant.  They have some excellent songs, unique sounds. If you haven't listened to their Love Death Immortality album, check it out. I personally think Drink the Sea was even better.  Tipper was amazing, but it's hard to believe that his sound is for everyone."
bassnectar,3cla6j,Pantsguy92,3,Wed Jul 8 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"Saw them at electric forest last year. It was alright. They overuse a lot of the same sounds and after 3-4 songs I though ""ok, we get it, your music is ""epic"", but switch up in pacing would have done them wonders"""
bassnectar,3cla6j,TweetPoster,2,Wed Jul 8 21:33:45 2015 UTC,if they would play their remixes more often they could have a much more diverse and unpredictable set.  their Heads Up remix would be perfect!

bassnectar,3cktbo,Pantsguy92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:39:55 2015 UTC,I have come across paler diamond 4 didfere the times 2 were the same exact set which was not bad the first time but then dissapointing...only decent time was Msytik Sanctuary! Mimosa is just trying to play a style that isnt him. He wasnt bad when he was original but trying to fit into mainstream trap doesn't work for his ego.
bassnectar,3cktbo,madonna220,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:28:06 2015 UTC,"Idk how I feel when people say he played the same set. Do you remember each song he played? Do you have recordings of both? Maybe they were similar, but I find it hard to believe they were the same. I always hear this ""djs playing the same set"" but I never see any basis behind it."
bassnectar,3cktbo,plur9,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"the first time i saw Paper diamon i honestly thought he killed it. just played bangers all night and i just love trap. but the 2nd,3rd,4th,5th,6th time i saw him it was literally the same exact set (he toured with nectar, hence why i saw him so many times)  i honestly respect the fact that he lets everyone know hes playing on an ipad. at least hes not faking and hes being real about it. ik people talk shit about him for that but in a way i respect it"
bassnectar,3cktbo,galvinb1,5,Thu Jul 9 11:24:07 2015 UTC,Love paperdiamonds live performances!!!
bassnectar,3cktbo,voodooxlady,2,Thu Jul 9 02:03:24 2015 UTC,I see PD everytime he comes to Bham in a tiny venue and its always awesome! Mimosa saw once at Hangout and threw down a really good trap set.. but could see how he could be iffy

bassnectar,3cktbo,Pantsguy92,6,Wed Jul 8 21:57:20 2015 UTC,Big Gigantic. I enjoy alot of their recorded music but fuck they are weak live.
bassnectar,3cktbo,Izahead,3,Wed Jul 8 23:38:44 2015 UTC,"Seen them 3 times and it's the same set. Counterpoint, block party, and a headline show. It was the same transitions and everything. Very disappointing. It's almost the exact same mix they did for Diplo and Friends. Love the music but they're hella mediocre live."
bassnectar,3cktbo,professionallurker93,5,Thu Jul 9 07:58:38 2015 UTC,"this is the thing about Big G, the last 2 years its basically been the same recycled set. idk how they can sit there and act like what theyre doing is legit. either theyre cokeheads and just dont give a fuck or they think their fans are too dumb to notice the same old sets. either way, its not good"
bassnectar,3cktbo,Pantsguy92,3,Thu Jul 9 11:05:05 2015 UTC,"They are the entry-level/starter-kit electronicjam band.  They stay ""current"" by continually raking in the newbies of the scene. Then, once those newbies cut their teeth on some fests, they realize Big G plays the same exact shit and move onto griz/gramatik/PL/insert future funk."
bassnectar,3cktbo,professionallurker93,2,Thu Jul 9 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"I saw them when they opened at basslights, then my girlfriend went to one of their shows when they went on tour the following spring. She said it was pretty much the same set. If I want to see some sax I'll go to griz he's killed it every time I've seen him."
bassnectar,3cktbo,Pantsguy92,2,Thu Jul 9 11:21:47 2015 UTC,yeah griz is soooooo much better
bassnectar,3cktbo,johnr9412,3,Thu Jul 9 11:32:16 2015 UTC,"Griz builds in those mini sax solos on a lot of his songs. Not hating on big g I like some of there songs but it just seems to be the same repetitive sax line throughout each song. And both times I've seen griz he throws in some old school funk or disco song, he played staying alive by the bee gees the last show I went to. He knows how to switch up his set from one tour stop to the next."
bassnectar,3cktbo,agkohlman,2,Thu Jul 9 12:21:26 2015 UTC,"yeah ik exactly what you mean with the same old sax sound. for sure  i love when Griz drops that ""we want the funk"" remix. that track is so much fun  i havent seen griz in a whiiiile now too"

bassnectar,3cktbo,EONS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:08:13 2015 UTC,I saw them back in 2012 in CO they were pretty dope back then. Saw them at RR this year. Good set but still left something to be desired. I'm just more of a fan of their older stuff.
bassnectar,3cktbo,plur9,3,Fri Jul 10 00:42:01 2015 UTC,"Bassnectar.....LOL jk 😉  Well not EXACTLY the same but I've always loved griz, and I saw him at counterpoint 14 and he blew my mind off. And then I saw him 5 months later at TomorrowWorld and he played almost the exact same set.   I still get down to Griz was just a little disappointing."
bassnectar,3cktbo,2ndOFakind,2,Wed Jul 8 22:40:57 2015 UTC,He's headlining now.... and still playing the same sets? Dang.  Love me some Griz but haven't seen live in awhile.

Hes a DJ and got famous for playing ULTRA and Tomorrowland and such, but he doesn't want his fans to ""rave."" I get that he thinks his music is ""pretty"" but I just wanted him to let his fans be whatever they wanted to be, like Lorin does. But he wouldn't let anyone bring in ANYTHING rave related, from light toys, to moon boots. He's also stopped his show because he saw two fans talking to each other in the crowd, as well as others for moshing... I just don't like that much control over the audience. We're there for the music... :("

bassnectar,3cktbo,plur9,4,Sun Jul 12 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but Excision. This is a bit of different situation though  Saw him at a super small venue back in like, feb 2011. Maybe 300-400 people. It was my first dubstep show. I say that because the whole ""EDM"" bonanza hadn't really blown up  yet, and that's what his music was. I caught the fever...fast forward a couple years to the Hudson Project, I didn't even last but 15 minutes at his set. Production was actually pretty good, but the music I just couldn't take it. Not really too crazy about the direction he's gone. Sad to say, I guess im just a little jaded"
bassnectar,3cktbo,ubbitz,5,Wed Jul 8 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"Maaan, I started listening to Excision like 7 or 8 years ago and just saw him for the first time at CounterPoint this year, he fucking shredded. Had me moving all night! Sorry he fell off for ya :("
bassnectar,3cktbo,Pantsguy92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:37 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah man, that's sick! I mean, I wouldn't go so far to say he ""fell off"" per se, he's doing big things for sure and I'm stoked about that. maybe I just pulled up to the set at the wrong time. I hate to sound like a hipster, I mean any artist stagnant in their sound would become pretty dull. It was just a shock to me and I didn't recieve it properly I guess!"
bassnectar,3cktbo,Pantsguy92,3,Wed Jul 8 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"That is literally my EXACT same story with exicision, he was my first show ever, back when swagger back was a new song. Tiny venue no visuals. Then fast foward saw him on his executioner tour and left early."

bassnectar,3cktbo,w0oster,3,Thu Jul 9 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about excisions sets... He was my first dubstep show back in '11. For me when I listen to shambhala 09-10, there was such an original style with all the tracks he was making and playing, and now it all seems over saturated with how filthy and noisy can we get... I still have mad respect for excision though."

bassnectar,3cktbo,oatmealfoot,2,Sat Jul 11 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"I still like his music, but Gladkill was a huge disappointment. I was incredibly excited to see him and he only played one track I knew, which I would have been fine with if the rest of the set was good, but it wasn't. G Jones actually opened up for him and he put on a far better show."
bassnectar,3cktbo,EONS,15,Wed Jul 8 19:29:31 2015 UTC,G Jones is an animal live. He's gonna be headlining shit in the next few years.
bassnectar,3cktbo,Benemy,2,Wed Jul 8 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"G-Jones' sound is pretty unique. He does different ""bleep bloops"" than other people's, I guess.   To me, his music sounds like the equivalent of music from a video game universe. One of my friends said she hated him at Red Rocks, but I loved the shit out of him at NYE and Red Rocks both.   The only problem is.... again with most openers for Nectar, there's a lack of diversity. I heard some of the same songs from NYE as I did at Red Rocks. They're good, but if he is going to headline some day, he will need to get way more content produced. I do think he will though. Especially if Lorin begins grooming him as rumored."
bassnectar,3cktbo,Pantsguy92,3,Wed Jul 8 22:57:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely agreed. I think based on the recent UKF interview with Lorin, its pretty clear he and G Jones are pals. He said something along the lines of seeing a young Bassnectar in G Jones, especially since they're from the same town. I can't wait to hear G Jones change and grow under Lorin's guidance"
bassnectar,3cktbo,Nfc24,3,Wed Jul 8 23:15:09 2015 UTC,"You think it's a 'problem' that you saw the -same- artist open up for the -SAME- headliner only 5 months apart ... and he played ""some of the same songs"" ?  idk what your expectations are, but most producer/DJs in that situation would end up dropping 85-90% of the same songs in that short of a timespan. But for G Jones, there was only like 25-30% overlap between the two sets, and that was just some of his more popular songs (which should absolutely be expected)  The dude cranks out music like a machine! He's put out just over a hundred songs and 6 bangin mixtapes in the last 3 years. IDK if you just weren't aware of that ... but his rate of production is pretty insane.  He's pretty likely to headline a show at Red Rocks next summer, or two years from now at the latest."
bassnectar,3cktbo,pdubs94,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't.   The last mixtape I saw him put out was after New Years, and it was more or less his New Years set.   Thanks for the info."
bassnectar,3cktbo,ticklemythigh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:47:55 2015 UTC,G Jones is legit. He has a great stage presence which I appreciate. Not a huge fan of his but yeah he's going places.

bassnectar,3cktbo,voodooxlady,2,Thu Jul 9 11:21:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, The M Machine. I saw them open for Madeon a few months back and thought their set was really basic sounding. Very little variation in tempo. They seemed to be enjoying themselves on stage, but the music they were hitting me with was really subpar. Then Madeon came on and blew the place up.   For the M Machine fans out there - my buddy and I actually met them in the 21+ section of the venue during madeon's set. They came out to watch the set, and my buddy's a huge fan and recognized them immediately. They were extremely nice dudes, very friendly to a couple of drunk college kids. Wouldn't buy another ticket for them, but I respect how nice they are."

bassnectar,3cktbo,bweezy26,2,Wed Jul 8 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Kygo for sure. I dug his Diplo&Friends mix from last year but we saw him live and he pretty much played the exact same set! He just kinda stood up there and did little hand dances and hardly mixed. It was really awful, Anna Lunoe (the opener) upstaged him 1000%"
bassnectar,3cktbo,EONS,2,Thu Jul 9 19:53:57 2015 UTC,I really liked Odesza live but to each their own I suppose. My biggest letdown was probably MiMOSA but I'm probably jaded by that vodka pouring/douche canoe incident

bassnectar,3cktbo,just-boof-it,4,Wed Jul 8 21:57:22 2015 UTC,I used to love Eliot Lipp. Saw him about a year ago. Straight trap set. Sat down the majority of the show. Also saw Alex b back in 2010 before paper diamond. Great show. Every paper diamond show I've seen has been awful.

bassnectar,3cktbo,toastercookie,-1,Thu Jul 9 01:45:21 2015 UTC,"I've seen STS9 twice. Once, well, I morelike heard them, as I was in the back of a bar in Florida and behind the bar is a weird kind of alley courtyard, and literally every outer part of this square block is bars, and so inside the block is a concert venue in like a courtyard, with an alley.   Anyway, some of the bars exit directly into the venue, some exit into the alley and have nothing to do with the venue (other side of the block). I was in one of those. I was jamming the fuck out and had no idea what I was listening to, eventually some chick came and sat down at my buddy and I's table and said ""STS9!""  We're like, ""who?!""   ""Sound Tribe Sector Nine!""  ...""oh. Well, they're awesome.""  I saw them a couple years later at a festival, they were still good but I definitely had heard some of the songs from that alley. Lack of diversity I guess. I feel like most jam bands blend together i the end."
bassnectar,3cktbo,RonBurgundy449,2,Wed Jul 8 19:18:38 2015 UTC,Lol. So you are telling me that you heard and remembered the same songs from when you were hanging in an alley way to seeing them 2+ years later? Don't judge them on that man. They are unreal.

bassnectar,3cktbo,csharp1990,2,Thu Jul 9 12:58:47 2015 UTC,i dont understand the odesza hype AT ALL  just sounds super hipstery to me. sometimes people like acts bc other people say theyre good. thats honestly how i feel about it
bassnectar,3cktbo,Smoke_Stack707,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:17:20 2015 UTC,"Were they playing a DJ set? How could it be ""push play"" with live drum pads and controllers?"
bassnectar,3cktbo,chops228,3,Wed Jul 8 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"Just because they are triggering some samples with controllers live doesn't mean that you get a unique experience. It just sounds like you're listening to their album, the tracks are exactly the same as the recorded versions it just sounds like they have a set lined up in ableton, press play on it, and then play back a few samples here and there. It's nothing exciting or worth it vs just chillin to their album at home."
bassnectar,3cktbo,ClarkGriswald123,2,Thu Jul 9 11:25:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what it seemed like at forest. It was cool seeing them drum along to the songs live, but I feel like they spent more than half the time doing that and the rest of the time going back to their controls to make the crowd believe they were mixing more of it live than they actually were. It was still an awesome set to be at though."
bassnectar,3cktbo,ozark_candyman,2,Wed Jul 8 20:40:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah it wasn't bad or anything, the visuals especially I thought were pretty dope, but when I saw them at CRSSD back in March they were on at the peak hour of the festival and I just wanted something with a bit more energy and uniqueness. Checked out Justin Martin instead, was the right choice for my mood at the time :D"
bassnectar,3cktbo,Stevo3193,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're  definitely one of the most mellow sets I've seen. Not in a bad way, but you gotta be in the right mood for that, otherwise I could see it getting very boring lol"

I definitely think the live drumming adds something to the set that a ""press play"" set can't touch and the visuals were on point. I agree with other people though that it wasn't like they ""made the track live in front of your eyes"". I like Odesza because the music isn't abrasive and sometimes that's what I'm in the mood for. I definitely think they will get better with time."

bassnectar,3ci9pf,A_Southern,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"As a Phish guy people are often surprised by my love for Nectar.  but that's because they just don't understand... I don't listen to much other electronic music, I just love shit that is good live, and Lorin's just the best.  To me, Phish and Primus are the only acts I've seen thus far that have compared to the live experience that Bassnectar provides, and GODDAMN are they fun.  So, if you love live music, give Phish a try.  Listen to some of the best sets in phishtory (I'd suggest 11/22/97, 12/11/97, 12/31/95, 12/31/99, 6/14/00, or even 10/31/2014 if you want the more current sound).  As a basshead you might not like it at all... or you might just fall in love.  Primus is really fun too but they're even weirder and harder to like.  But if you like Lorin's live sets, Primus is pretty similar with their visual style.  He even remixed their song ""Here Come the Bastards.""  Just thought this was an appropriate place to say this because this is some stuff many bassheads probably wouldn't be inclined to listen to much but many would actually appreciate."
bassnectar,3ci9pf,alphalights,2,Wed Jul 8 16:39:19 2015 UTC,I've never gotten into Phish or The Dead. They just never tickled my fancy. I really like DMB and Widespread Panic though. Especially Live. I'll have to listen to some of these sets!

I'd highly recommend you come out for Basslights if it's in Hampton this year.  Great venue, great atmosphere. Worth every penny in my opinion. But then again I've never had to worry about travel expenses, maybe someone else could touch on that. By the same token every dollar I spent on my NYE trip was worth it.

I remember chillin at my frat house, and one of my homies found out I had tickets to BN at RR, so he's like, get in my car, and we blasted   Bassnectar for like 30 minutes haha. The first song that really hit me was Infinite, but I also remember him showing me Laughter Crescendo and I fucking loved it.   The first song from Bassnectar I hear live was the Frog Song, but after that sick fucking harmonic space ship intro on night 2 of Red Rocks 2014. And since then I've been listening to Lo almost non-stop!"

bassnectar,3cgvwz,bluefire1717,5,Tue Jul 7 21:59:17 2015 UTC,Color storm. Was in the electric forest 2012 trailer. Saw him there that year. Now seen him 10 times since.

bassnectar,3cgvwz,TheGanjanator,2,Wed Jul 8 00:25:23 2015 UTC,"First Bassnectar song I heard has to be Enter the Chamber.   I remember that damn Buick ad.   Then, probably it was the Lights remix. I thought it was good, heavy sounding. I think I was constantly hearing it in League of Legends streams at the time.   Not long after one of my friends went to a Bassnectar show and reported the madness back to me. I looked up more songs of his.   Timestretch is the first to hook me, I guess."

I looked him up tho and first track was Underwater, I knew it was the best track I had ever heard as soon as I heard it! First LIVE track was Hot right NAO -> Infinite ;)"
bassnectar,3cgvwz,PagingStereophonic,2,Tue Jul 7 20:45:41 2015 UTC,"Love when this question comes up. ""Intro"" off MtU, when a friend recommended I check out Bassnectar. Downloaded a torrent of the album and was immediately hooked. I remember wishing the album was ""harder"". If only I knew what was to come. ;)"
bassnectar,3cgvwz,PagingStereophonic,2,Tue Jul 7 20:53:43 2015 UTC,"It would be the entire ""Mesmerizing the Ultra"" album for me. A friend who had just seen him live in probably 2009 at Summercamp, I believe, told me to check him out out of the blue. I looked for an album to download, stumbled upon MtU and thought it was okay. It was good, but I wasn't blown away by it at the time. Eventually, I looked up and downloaded ""Underground Communication."" I liked it even more, but I still wasn't blown away. Sometime in early 2011, I got $5 of free Amazon mp3 credit for buying a textbook and decided to get Cozza Frenzy with it. With that album, I was HOOKED. Only a a short time later, I was looking for a show to go to and ended up driving five hours to the Columbus, OH show at LC Pavilion because the show in Kalamazoo, MI sold out. After that, the rest is history.  I still haven't traveled to Red Rocks, though. I don't have a huge travel fund, and my vacation time from work is limited (I'd rather put them both toward festivals)."
bassnectar,3cgvwz,TheRolandDeschain,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:09 2015 UTC,"Technically the first song I ever heard from Bassnectar was ""Here we go"" then followed by the whole Timestrech EP! One of my college friends took this burned CD out of her backpack while we were all studying for a Bio exam and we just heard out loud from her laptop. During the time I remember being blown away but during that time I didn't look more in to it. I would only hear this CD during our studying sessions. This was in the fall of 2010. Fast forward to December 2014 when I decide to go to Basslights to see Pretty Lights. Then after that killer Pretty lights set, I got my mind blown by Bassnectar and I have been a die hard fan since them! I saw him both nights at basslights, 3 nights at red rocks 2015 and EF!"
bassnectar,3cgvwz,Fuck_Cabbage,2,Tue Jul 7 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"The first song that really caught my attention was ""Magical World"" with Nelly Furtado. That song just really spoke to me and I was hooked from that point on. :)"
bassnectar,3cgvwz,EtheterrorR,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:57:28 2015 UTC,It's a beautiful song. I wish he played it more. I've only heard it live one time.

bassnectar,3cgvwz,assfacefobbs,2,Wed Jul 8 01:08:03 2015 UTC,"I saw Rusko live in 2009 knowing nothing much about electronic music. He truly popped my cherry into bass music. I told my friend about it and he said I have to go with him and see this guy called Bassnectar. I watched this video and then saw him live soon after and never looked back. So I guess you could say that remix popped my cherry, but I was also so intrigued by those visuals because I had never seen anybody before with such cool lights and visuals to their songs before."

But then I just kept listening to that album and when I heard Above & Beyond I completely fell in love. I had no idea music could someone feel the way that song made me feel. Basshead for life."

bassnectar,3cgvwz,beepbeepgreenjeep420,2,Wed Jul 8 04:49:56 2015 UTC,"The first song that got me hooked as fuck with no turning back was at my third show at Ultra 2013 weekend 1, The Matrix. He was playing the insanely massive mainstage at the same time that Tiesto played the Megastructure, so it was easy as fuck to just waltz up to the front row where it was purely bassheads getting down. I'll never forget seeing the visuals for that song scrolling down the screen and then the entire stage lighting turned into cascading greens with black spots. Fuck me"

bassnectar,3ccfja,Manhattan_24,2,Mon Jul 6 23:04:04 2015 UTC,Favorite Bassnectar moment to date and why?
bassnectar,3ccfja,Zenmaster7,5,Tue Jul 7 00:57:27 2015 UTC,"Well, how can one truly choose a single moment during Lorin's long and eventful career? They don't. Anytime i'm listening to Bassnectar whether it be a concert or on headphones, it's euphoria. But the moments where its almost been orgasmic has to be either the Genesis Remix at Lincoln, NE on 9/27/2013. This moment because at the time that song was the one everybody knew and listened to from Immersive Pt.1 but also one i'd never seen live. The second moment was Night 2 RR 2013, this moment qualifies for a number of reasons. Sub Focus' album had been released and was hoping to hear Turn It Around. (It wasn't played but i still seen Sub Focus live) The 2nd and obviously most important reason was Frog Song, this song is the one i'd be willing give up a limb to have a lossless DL of. With also the Close Encounters Opening and the bass if anyone was there can agree was overwhelming. Thank You. BNF"

bassnectar,3ccfja,masterBAJA,2,Mon Jul 6 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"Well, fuck. I doubt he would abandon said plans entirely. I'm guessing either the date is in flux now, or the IAMA people are still catching up from their blackout shit."
bassnectar,3ccfja,EONS,2,Mon Jul 6 22:41:42 2015 UTC,The AMA is being rescheduled. Stay tuned for more info :)

bassnectar,3cdcg8,Benemy,2,Tue Jul 7 14:41:32 2015 UTC,Is it even a remix? Sounds pretty much the same except maybe some percussion
bassnectar,3cdcg8,Molly_Model_Man,2,Tue Jul 7 12:07:15 2015 UTC,Ditto. He did the same thing for Meow. It's not really a remix. He seems to add drum samples to every track that isn't his for live performances so they sound better and hit harder. I personally asked Seth Drake and he said every track has been remastered for live performances.
bassnectar,3cdcg8,Benemy,2,Tue Jul 7 19:50:40 2015 UTC,Yeah this is kinda what I figured. Seems like he edits every track he plays that's not made by him so that they fit better into his sets.

bassnectar,3cdcg8,ubbitz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:26:09 2015 UTC,Idk because he's been playing it at shows and he's released some big remixes already (No Way/One Thing). If it was gonna be released wouldn't it have been already?
bassnectar,3cdcg8,EONS,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"He's got another release coming later this year and he retweeted someone that asked about this remix and told them to tell purity ring that we want it, which sort of tells me he plans on unleashing it sometime"

bassnectar,3calla,Smalltownlegend,4,Mon Jul 6 15:50:23 2015 UTC,I'm a bit out of the loop... is it a competition to be a Bassnectar fan now? I don't get this colorado pride thing either.
bassnectar,3calla,drilldozerbaggins,4,Mon Jul 6 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"No one gets it really.. But if you say that to one of those kids, they'll tell you its a CO thing and you just don't understand it (LOL!). I get a kick out of them, because there isn't much you can do."
bassnectar,3calla,ecro1992,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:48:43 2015 UTC,"well, i can get it in a sense -- ""in a sense"" meaning: I see it as a land of many possibilities with the vast, diverse landscape, the legal herbs, dope venues, and the immense possibilities to immerse in bass. However, my perspective has been that 'pride' is a result of earning something or contributing to something.  Being proud of where you're from is understandable, but I've tried to remain modest about it as I never earned the right to be born in my home place nor was I given choice to be. No one was.  I perceive modesty as a respectable trait and I simply don't understand this tribal mentality concerning where you come from.  We're all a tribe, in a sense, and regardless of where we come from, we embody similar tastes and ideals.  Colorado is cool, I am sure, but the US is fucking massive, which means there are many, many cool places, too.  I guess I find it imposing on what I've come to learn about the fanbase of bassnectar.  Even in 2011 you didn't see CO flags blowing up the spot... we just blew shit up with energy, dancing our asses off together, whacky totems, and glowstick fireworks."

bassnectar,3calla,Smalltownlegend,3,Mon Jul 6 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"Nah, people from Chicago don't post on every family photo circle jerking how they live in CO, like the world revolves around them. Also, how they need a basslights, and a halloween, and a 360, and a 3 night run at RR."
bassnectar,3calla,ecro1992,2,Tue Jul 7 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"my favorite thing is everyone from colorado thinks that this imaginary festival that bassnectar is now going to throw because of this petition should be there. because 3 nights red rocks, decadence and belly up aren't enough. they deserve it the most for sure"
bassnectar,3calla,Smalltownlegend,2,Tue Jul 7 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"I hate to generalize, but damn, some people should be grateful for what they have (like not petitioning for a festival..), its just not good for the scene flatout. CO gets more nectar in 3 nights than a lot of states get in years.."

bassnectar,3cb53n,Smalltownlegend,6,Mon Jul 6 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"Yea I wish this was less demanding, and more of a ""these are all the ppl willing to spend $x to make that happen"""
bassnectar,3cb53n,dapi331,3,Mon Jul 6 18:42:25 2015 UTC,the only reason it was created was to stroke the kid who created it's online ego. sucks because he's a cool dude in real life. just makes himself look like a jackass via the Internet.
bassnectar,3cb53n,Smalltownlegend,19,Mon Jul 6 19:04:53 2015 UTC,These petitions suck. Lets all tell Lorin what to do and how to perform as Bassnectar.

bassnectar,3cb53n,Smalltownlegend,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:24:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think Lorin knows the in's and out's, and every nook and cranny of the festival circuit, and whats possible and what it would actually take than anyone. If he does do it, it will need to be perfect, because it would be his name on the line. I trust if its meant to happen, then it will, but thats something that Lorin has a better grasp than anyone of us has."
bassnectar,3cb53n,ecro1992,2,Mon Jul 6 20:29:22 2015 UTC,I honestly think that this is what he will be working on since he isn't doing a tour.

Cmon dude its a petition, no matter how many frills you put on it, everyone, especially the man himself, is gonna see right through you.  I said it in the last post and I'll say it in this one, This is one of the most toxic and poisonous things to happen to this Community since BNF!!!!!!!!!!! We aren't against Bassnectar, we're all on the same side. how can we justify a petition. Petition against his petition!"
bassnectar,3cb53n,CopedeGrace,3,Mon Jul 6 15:52:55 2015 UTC,the OG poster was the guy who created it and he deleted his post after he got ripped on by everyone on this sub. it's funny that he edited it because he was literally bitching people out on facebook and Twitter yesterday for not agreeing with the petition.
bassnectar,3cb53n,Smalltownlegend,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"It's funny how night and day the different social media platforms are.

Then it gets posted on Reddit and the response is the polar opposite."
bassnectar,3cb53n,F1GUR3,2,Mon Jul 6 19:06:40 2015 UTC,oh he definitely got shit for it on FB too.
bassnectar,3cb53n,Spacetimejumpa,0,Mon Jul 6 21:20:49 2015 UTC,I've noticed most on reddit are more reserved and logical than the ones who circle jerk facebook groups.   edit: also there are a vast majority of bassnectar fans on Twitter who think this is the dumbest thing ever and are pissed it's going around.

bassnectar,3cb53n,GTJackD,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:19:37 2015 UTC,Congratulations. This is the stupidest thing I've read or heard all day.  The guy who starts a petition for a Bassnectar festival isn't a Basshead. lol.

bassnectar,3cb53n,Smalltownlegend,-1,Tue Jul 7 05:54:11 2015 UTC,yeah it actually makes sense. bassheads should respect bassnectar and crating a petition to make him do something isn't very respectful.
bassnectar,3cb53n,CopedeGrace,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"thank you , thats all i mean by it. Just because you listen to his music doesnt mean anything.

bassnectar,3cb53n,Smalltownlegend,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:10:21 2015 UTC,"a petition isn't forcing him to do anything. do you not understand that? it was simply created to show support for the idea. you are taking something that is supposed to be positive and turning it into something negative. i realize there are two sides to everything and i respect your opinion but could you please open your eyes and realize that nobody is ""disrespecting"" Lo. did you see the amount of support and good comments that the petition received? if you think that's disrespect, we have two totally different interpretations of the word, my friend."
bassnectar,3cb53n,Smalltownlegend,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"that petition says ""Hey bassnectar you don't do enough for us. this is what we want now, actually we require it. so get to to it because I have a bunch of people that think the same way""   fucking disrespect. to the T. sorry if we don't agree. but that's how I and a lot of the bassnectar fans feel."
bassnectar,3cb53n,Pantsguy92,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"That isn't at all what it says. It was a good idea. Here is the English definition of ""petition"" :  Petition - a formal written request, typically one signed by many people, appealing to authority with respect to a particular cause.  When I signed that petition and posted it, I wasn't being ungrateful. I was simply passing along a really cool idea. Yes, Lo does a lot for us and I very much appreciate everything he does but this was a cool idea that a lot of people are behind. Whether he decides to do it, that's up to him but you can't say that we are showing disrespect. Stop being so sensitive and accept the fact that this petition wasn't made to hurt or offend anyone."
bassnectar,3cb53n,Mad_Hatter_Bot,0,Tue Jul 7 20:12:57 2015 UTC,sorry I don't agree. get over it. it is disrespectful and the wording is whiney and entitled. to each his own.

I don't think there was any legit ill-will in the creator's petition, but at the very least it's just communicated wrongly. We should just let Lo pursue his creative vision, because he's obviously a badass at what he does. If I was the dude who made the petish I'd just take it down. Not in a cunty way, I'd just take it down lol"

bassnectar,3cb53n,Benemy,2,Mon Jul 6 22:12:42 2015 UTC,Does anyone here sincerely believe this petition was made with the mindset that Lorin would have to listen to us and make this festival happen?   I think it's pretty obvious that the tone of this isn't demanding anything.
bassnectar,3cb53n,CopedeGrace,3,Mon Jul 6 22:48:11 2015 UTC,"Thats kinda what a petition is? No ones asking nicely. ""we the people require""? he even edited it cuz it did sound too demanding, but it still does, go reread it a few more times lol"
bassnectar,3cb53n,too_old_still_party,2,Mon Jul 6 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"Well if the intention is to show Lorin the support is there for a festival like the one proposed in the petition then I can see why this guy decided to go the petition route. It's an easy way to show how many people would support something since change.org has a generator for these things.   I read this as ""Hey Lorin look how many people would love this, it would be incredible!"", not ""Lorin you gotta do this or we'll be pissed""."
bassnectar,3cb53n,Dpjelley,2,Mon Jul 6 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"I can dig it, i looked up the definition of petition and it was connotationless(not a word haha) and i think that most people including myself see petition lorin ashton and put a negative spin on it, almost like we're banding against him.  Also though, the guy did edit it today, the first draft was slightly demanding, which is partly why people have been freaking out"
bassnectar,3cb53n,bass-hector,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:02:49 2015 UTC,this is how i feel about it. nobody is demanding anything. it's a petition but it wasn't supposed to be taken in a way that would offend anyone. i think it's awesome that so many people are down for the cause and would love to see it happen. i appreciate everything that Lo does and i didn't post this with the intention of starting an argument.

bassnectar,3cb53n,GTJackD,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"As much as I wish there would be a Bassnectar festival...  You have to think about injuries, and death. Think about all the drug related deaths that happen at EDC and other festivals. Those that run the festival are being shit on all the time.    Imagine if he had a festival and 5 people died from drug related problems. Questions would come up... Was there enough water stations? Was security not good enough? Could this have been prevented?      All of these questions and concerns are now blamed on Bassnectar and his team. I highly doubt he wants any of that, as he has enough to deal with already.     No one wants a headline on the Internet that states ""3 kids hospitalized from drug overdose at Bassnectar Festival"" (or whatever he would call it)"
bassnectar,3cd8nv,bvsshevd,3,Tue Jul 7 00:26:48 2015 UTC,"he literally tweets yearly ""don't vote for me""   he just did it today. if he does start getting listed anywhere in the top 100, that's when we will have a problem."

Excision actually just posted a tweet about this not even an hour ago that I thought was really on point. Trust me I agree 100%. I just would've assumed an artist as big as he would've been able to at least crack top 100. He deserves number one realistically.

bassnectar,3cd3xi,Coach_Louis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like ticket threads should only be up for a month or until a major show happens. That or we can just go through the post after shows and delete comments that are asking/selling tickets for shows that already happened. I agree it keeps the clutter down, but it's pretty cluttered in there too."

bassnectar,3cbj7a,madrigalaxy,2,Mon Jul 6 17:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, still in the same boat over here. I've been in contact with customer service and they were able to make sure my package got out last Thursday (7/2), however I had to contact them again to get a tracking number. Try going to bassnectar.net, then choose the store and there should be a chat now box on the bottom right of the screen. Hopefully they can do the same for you!   Side note: Little ridiculous it's taking this long, I really expected them to ship it out on time so we would get the album the day it came out or even the day after."

Maybe you will look back on it 10 years from now and have a different outlook on the image and whatnot (unlikely ;P). But as long as it has some profound meaning to you, it really doesn't matter. That's my philosophy behind it I guess. For me, it was so much more than just branding myself as a ""bass head"" and my love for the music. Of course, that is very near and dear to my heart, but it was the impact that it has had on my life, musically and spiritually. Nothing will ever change that, even if the music and images do (bassdrops v1,2,3 w/e). And I want to remind myself of those memories forever, regardless of how I feel about Bassnectar later in life."
bassnectar,3c7w4r,stickyicky61,3,Mon Jul 6 03:45:49 2015 UTC,"My interpretation of the bassdrop is that 1: it means whatever we want it to mean and 2: Lorin's meaning behind it is some kind of beautiful musical collage of people that all love each other and of course the music.  The first meaning is the reason i would get it, that and its the symbol of my favorite artist haha"

I saw an interview with him where he said when he started he was the one of the only bass music artist in the US he knew of. I know Dieselboy started not to long after him, couldnt even say any other DJ artists I know that started before him"
bassnectar,3c8nm1,ben10103,4,Tue Jul 7 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"Geez this is gunna be hard. I would have to say it really comes down to the community vibe he creates and the beauty he can add to music. Lights is a perfect example. The original was ok but even my parents liked the Bassnectar remix and if you knew them and their taste in music you would understand how that's a big deal. He can add in beauty to his songs while still keeping the noise and punch of his music very real.   Also the man has been doing this for soooo long. I was just re listening to mesmerizing the ultra yesterday and couldn't help think to myself damn he was still killing all his beats way back then. It's awesome that someone like Lorin can keep the energy going for so many years.   Last but certainly not least let's talk the visuals at his shows. Lorin puts millions into his visuals and to keep them amazing. Some points during seeing him live I would just stop in place, in time and just reflect on the beauty of life and the beauty of sound. It's a mesmerizing effect that is hard to explain but I have never felt that at any other live event. The combination of his beautiful music and his beautiful visuals is just an explosion of euphoria that contributes to that experience of seeing Bassnectar live. Hopefully that can help explain why Lorin is on a complete different level.   EDIT: forgot to mention Lorins possibly unhealthy obsession to make sounds better, louder, nastier :)"
bassnectar,3c8nm1,whiteout7942,3,Mon Jul 6 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"Lorin puts more effort, commitment, and love into Bassnectar then the majority of his peers put into their career."
bassnectar,3c8nm1,ashtonectar,2,Sun Jul 5 23:30:57 2015 UTC,"He just hears the way songs can be mixed and mashed better than anyone else. He is more technically skilled than the majority of other DJs/Producers (maybe Tipper beats him, but they're almost incomparable, as Tipper still spins vinyl etc. at times).  The things he does.... sometimes he might have 5 or more songs playing at the same time at a show, all of which have their own visuals, and he is livemixing them.   King of the Sound."

bassnectar,3c8nm1,posermobile1991,2,Mon Jul 6 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"His sets tell stories, even more impressive the story changes from set to set. Bassnectar creates and remasters/edits/levels tracks to sound perfect, to the point where you can HEAR and FEEL everything that's needed in the song being presented. All the while his crew is presenting this set or ""story"" with the apex of visual art that is synced simultaniously with his music.   That's the most sussinct and full answer I can give you as to why this man ROCKS! (By the way, that description completely leaves out the community factor... Which I did not mean to leave out, but the question seemed to only hit on why Bassnectar is SO GOOD! If we had to get into the community... I'd be writing a 40 Page essay on how incredible, kind, beautiful and supportive the majority of his sincere following are.)"
bassnectar,3c8nm1,Zenmaster7,2,Mon Jul 6 16:09:59 2015 UTC,"His passion. He, more than any other artist I have ever come across, truly loves what he does with all his heart. Music and community are two integral parts of humanity that he loves and meshes together in beautiful ways. It is easy to be good at something you love doing ;) a life lesson for all of us."
bassnectar,3c8nm1,OnZu,2,Tue Jul 7 01:06:18 2015 UTC,"As a musician who was re inspired the moment I heard my first nectar song in 2009, I think it's plain and simple: He does it for the music. He doesn't try to sound like what's ""in"". He is a true artist that creates from his heart and mind."
bassnectar,3c8nm1,yo_dj,2,Tue Jul 7 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"It's a mixture of artistic creativity and technical ability, both which he has honed over tens of thousands of hours in the studio. Producing, mixing, and mastering are skills that most any dedicated person can learn. The key differentiator is the sheer time he's spent on a computer learning the in's and out's of Ableton and other software. Knowing all of the most effective ways to create certain sounds takes years. In the end, the best technicians are usually the people who have spent the most time in front of a computer. For Lorin, he also benefits from his immense network of collaborators. He thanks them constantly. Because each brings new tricks and technical knowledge to the project. Really, he benefits from being a likable, popular guy that other people want to work with and share their skills with. As for the creative side...that's what makes him a true space-unicorn. I will never comprehend what goes on in his brain that allows him to create sounds that make my heart jump through my eyeballs. I only imagine that he's unlocked the portion of his brain that 99.99% of humans have yet to access."

I read somewhere that when they collabed on Above & Beyond, Lorin wanted to shoot for a symphony type song and flow, and I guess Seth has quite a bit of experience with those types of sounds being a mastering genius, and came out with the masterpiece that is Above & Beyond. To this day one of my all time favorites."

Everything always seems like it's something special rather than just another show or song. He's the only artist that makes going to a show feel like a holiday.
bassnectar,3c8nm1,Pantsguy92,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:39:46 2015 UTC,to me it all comes down to one word: integrity  he has more of it than ANYONE in this scene

What ends up happening is the stream of water shooting out turns flat and wide so it gets everyone wet but not soaked. If only I was allowed to bring it in.

As far as getting to the front, I'm honestly either happy in the middle or for some of the heavier acts, I love the mosh pit.  But yeah after his new album, I'm beyond stoked to see nectar."

bassnectar,3c4izb,Ibfac,3,Sat Jul 4 18:36:18 2015 UTC,We did it at tomorrow world. Stayed at the same stage for 4 hours..missed a couple acts.  In the end it wasn't worth it. In the middle of the crowd is where I belong .

bassnectar,3c4izb,EyyoEddie,2,Sun Jul 5 03:56:27 2015 UTC,I want to do that too. How early do you think I should get there to get a spot?
bassnectar,3c4izb,Crackadelic,2,Sat Jul 4 18:52:58 2015 UTC,Last year the acts on prior to nectar were chill so when nectar came up me and my friends just got up and walked into the middle. good spots. This year it'll be bigger and Idk what acts are on prior. That's really a deciding factor I'd say. Probably little to no need to camp all day at a small fest like this

bassnectar,3c1tur,sourgangbang,4,Sat Jul 4 05:13:53 2015 UTC,View was completely blocked by totems from where I was at. Didn't see Lorin once then I heard after the show that he had a SCI member up there playing violin? I agree fuck totems
bassnectar,3c1tur,psychonuto,8,Sat Jul 4 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"I'm all for the idea of totems, in that you can put something expressive on it and it makes it into the family photo. Also it's helpful for finding friends, or recording a set via go-pro.   However, building totems that are so ridiculously long that they have to stay vertical constantly is just dumb as shit.   I think we need to push for a trend of collapsable poles for totems. That way you can extend it during the family photo, or to find your friends, but also put it down and forget about it. I can't imagine being the idiot that feels the need to wave a huge flag on a ten foot pole throughout the entire set.   Just listen to the music and enjoy yourself. Stop worrying about self-promoting for a second. Build a reasonably sized totem that won't be obnoxious during a set, and everyone's happy."
bassnectar,3c1tur,Nfc24,2,Sat Jul 4 07:20:36 2015 UTC,"""Self-promoting.""  Perfectly put.  I get you are having the time of your life, but please don't make the show about yourself because there are thousands of others trying to embrace the same beautiful experience.  We don't need to read or think about Poop Dick while watching something so magical and beautiful.  Save the totems/signs for the family picture.    Respect your brothers and sisters, and be mindful of your neighbors :)"
bassnectar,3c1tur,expandedtime,2,Sat Jul 4 15:10:58 2015 UTC,"The collapsible totem idea is genius, because you don't really need your totem in the air during the whole set"
bassnectar,3c1tur,downwiththerobotbass,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:04:39 2015 UTC,Exactly. A telescoping rod would be ideal for totems.
bassnectar,3c1tur,Nfc24,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:55:49 2015 UTC,Totem sticks usually have to be cardboard to get in the door... or you don't get to bring it in.

bassnectar,3c1tur,elk_rider,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:10:06 2015 UTC,Interesting. I've seen plenty of retractable metal poles/pvc pipes/broom sticks at festivals in the Pacific Northwest.
bassnectar,3c1tur,downwiththerobotbass,6,Mon Jul 6 22:16:38 2015 UTC,I agree with you.  Some totems are funny and get a laugh or two out of me but for the most part I think they are obnoxious and need to go away.  I for one am thankful when a venue bans totems.  Like Red Rocks this year banned totems and I was so glad.  I did not want to travel halfway across the country to see my favorite artist in a legendary venue only to have my view of the stage blocked by some flag waving asshole or some douche with a big cardboard Patrick face or something.
bassnectar,3c1tur,Smokey_Bera,2,Sat Jul 4 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"Bassnectar as Red Rocks this year was my first CO and RR experience. I am so glad to hear that this is the year they banned totems, because his visuals were fucking amazing <3"
bassnectar,3c1tur,Zenmaster7,3,Sun Jul 5 05:20:40 2015 UTC,"I love totems. I think they add to the creativity and beauty of a festival if done properly. Like you said though, some are poorly mad, hardly thought out, and made in 2 minutes. But overall I tend to enjoy them and see their use. However, at a Bassnectar show, that shit needs to be laid down, left at the campsite, or otherwise discarded for the need. The point is to get Lost in the Crowd. Totems kind of sicken me at Nectar shows because his music gives me such a sense of unity that I find the numerous totems to be harsh reminders of the various egos in the room, fighting to live and to be noticed. It's a love/hate. But I am on board with you, totems should not be taken to Nectar shows."
bassnectar,3c1tur,Zenmaster7,3,Sun Jul 5 05:18:59 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, but seems like it's more of an all or nothing scenario. Otherwise, impossible to enforce."
bassnectar,3c1tur,posermobile1991,2,Mon Jul 6 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"^ This!!! you're completely right, all the hope that something like collapsable totems or totem size regulation will stop the problem is just wishful thinking. This problem will not be solved unless there is an outright ban of totems… and knowing the types of kids in the scene, totems will STILL be snuck in and used, but if there is an active ban in place there would undoubtedly be less making it through security…which i'm fine with. The amount of totems and their placement in 2011 at ALL fests were executed tastefully and respectfully as to not interfere with others experience, now it's just a ton of naive people fighting for the rail so their totem can get into the family picture and fuck-all to the people behind them. It's making the price of admission harder to justify with each passing year"
bassnectar,3c1tur,Fatphillmargera,3,Tue Jul 21 14:46:16 2015 UTC,"The totems that I really can't handle are the ones that are faces of the people holding them or just stupid inside jokes that no one else thinks is funny. It's a super selfish thing to do, IMO"
bassnectar,3c1tur,downwiththerobotbass,2,Sun Jul 5 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"Shambhala2014  But in all honesty, I did laugh at those obnoxious face totems."
bassnectar,3c1tur,posermobile1991,2,Mon Jul 6 16:48:13 2015 UTC,I always make totems that are cut out with the design so you can see through them. Some of y'all saw my blast off space ship as well as my 808 at basslights. They didn't block the view like a big rectangle of cardboard.   Many people have come up and thanked me for making them because it made it easy for them to find their friends in the area.

bassnectar,3c1tur,axilidade,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment, but wanted to point out that your picture isn't of the stage that nectar played on. (you have sherwood court; he was at ranch arena)  also, unless I'm mistaken, he didn't bring his NVSB stage or anything. I remember cool visuals on the preprovided screens and great lights, but nothing special he brought in or anything like that."
bassnectar,3c1tur,brianendres,2,Sat Jul 4 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"Quite being so specific lol its the principle of the fact that totems are out of control and he usually rolls around with his visuals, granted probably not this year that much since he isnt doing a tour, hes doing all festivals so he has to use what is provided, and if you bothered to watch the video i posted, that video obviously was the right stage.... flooded with totems, the picture just shows how many totems there were at Forest, regardless what stage it was."

bassnectar,3byryc,Coach_Louis,2,Fri Jul 3 16:30:07 2015 UTC,I never really understood the hate for you and me. I think its a really heavy emotion track that fits Nectar
bassnectar,3byryc,Bustin_Chiffarobe,3,Fri Jul 3 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"If you went to a lot of stops on the NVSB tour then you heard the song way too much, kind of burnt out on it because basically every show of that tour closed with that song just before or after the family photo. I still love it but thats probably the reason for the discontent. Right before he released that track he talked about it being his favorite and really encapsulating his feelings of friendship and togetherness, which is why its still such a great and touching track."

Doesn't make much sense especially since he's only doing special events, so that would call for him to spread out his shows that much more. Who knows tho, maybe he's moving NYE or something along those lines. But personally, I don't see him putting all his special events within 3 months in the same region, let alone same time zone.

bassnectar,3bwgn8,ecro1992,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:56:25 2015 UTC,As far as his roo set goes he had two less towers on each side of him compared to red rocks. But the visuals on the screen was definitely stepped up from when I see him in the fall/BL. You can tell that Lorin wasn't the only one at work on the material. His visual team came out with a lot great new stuff. Had a great time in the pit for that set.
bassnectar,3bwgn8,galvinb1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"If bisco  puts the same amount of production into the stages as previous years, I feel like the stage is big enought to fit his entire red rocks set up (4 pillars on each side plus another horizontal pillaon top of the main screen behind him). I'm curious to see how the stages are going to be set up at montage. My guess is two main stages next to each other, one smaller stage in addition to the Toyota pavilion, and tent for the silent disco"
bassnectar,3bwgn8,Pantsguy92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:22:34 2015 UTC,i wouldnt expect any of those things for bisco tbh. if we get a dance tent ill be soooooo happy but i really dont think we'll get one

bassnectar,3bwf08,QCCLT,9,Thu Jul 2 18:30:38 2015 UTC,its important because I wear a pink elephant suit to every show and everyone loves me and thats why its important that is the only reason

bassnectar,3bwf08,thereisdwarf,2,Fri Jul 3 15:33:28 2015 UTC,"My first Nectar show was 11/15/12 at Umass Mullins Center, I just hit my 16th at EF, not an OG Basshead but hopefully I can try to shed some light here. For me, its weird, its heavy, its fucking PINK ELEPHANTS. Even though its not a Bassnectar track, the only place you will hear it is at a Bassnectar show. I just love the weirdness of the track and the heaviness of the drop. It is my favorite non-nectar track for him to play and I will always hope for it :). OH YES. PINK ELEPHANTS"
bassnectar,3bwf08,ben10103,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:51:43 2015 UTC,Yeah the big visual is something to have probably brought the hype up as it was played more. Very very nice visuals0:

bassnectar,3bwf08,ben10103,2,Fri Jul 3 00:28:32 2015 UTC,That opening was mind blowing! Loved the 3 nights at Red Rocks!
bassnectar,3bwf08,CopedeGrace,2,Mon Jul 6 16:58:41 2015 UTC,Now that is a song i wanna here live. Can't remember if he played it in Columbus 2012 or not considering that was the day he released the FREESTYLE MIXTAPE!!!! He played almost the whole mixtape live so i probably heard it and just don't remember. That was my first show.
bassnectar,3bwf08,EONS,2,Fri Jul 3 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, he actually plays Human at shows?  Fuck. I need this."
bassnectar,3bwf08,thestrangestick,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"My first Bassnectar show was in Indianapolis in 2012. My friends and I stupidly spent too long drinking in our car, because we had been to too many EDM shows where there is an excruciating 4 hours of warm up acts you probably don't care about, and were yet to realise how special and different Bassnectar shows are. We missed the first 20 minutes or so, which means we made up for it by being super into what we did see. Right at the end, just when I didn't think it could get any more awesome, he starts up Pink Elephants. I had randomly found this track on YouTube over a year before, and never in a million years expected him to drop this obscure track. The hype, especially when the visuals got going, was real. Cue me screaming 'OOOH YES, PINK ELEPHANTS' into the ears of my bemused friends.   And that is why Pink Elephants is so awesome."
bassnectar,3bwf08,Zenmaster7,2,Fri Jul 3 04:29:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I might be one of the few who don't really enjoy the hype for the song. A lot of the crowd at EF was so itching to hear Pink Elephants that I heard some after the show complaining he didn't play it...like what? Other than that though, I got my Pink Elephants last year at Moonrise and it was fucking glorious."
bassnectar,3bwf08,bvsshevd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:08:53 2015 UTC,It's just special because he incorporates massive visuals with it and it's a fun and dirty song in itself. And like someone said earlier it's pretty much exclusive to bassnectar

bassnectar,3bt2qp,beepbeepgreenjeep420,2,Thu Jul 2 14:14:06 2015 UTC,"http://www.bassnectar.net/2015/05/think-for-yourself/  I feel a lot of people that were hating on the set don't realize whats going on within his music. He's gathered this huge following were a large amount of people will pack like sardines into main stages, and has taken this oppurtunity to create a project of music that makes people question what's going on around them i.e the government, socially, within music, and just like the title of the article says to THINK FOR YOURSELF. Hence him putting THINK FOR YOURSELF on the screen at the end, I know this isn't for every single person but the majority of youth and some of the older generation have heard a track by Bassnectar. Music festivals are getting popular and even if you aren't the biggest fan of his music, you see those messages. Thats all I gotta say its just my opinion, if you think he didn't play enough ""bangers"" you were either too fucked up or you don't realize that yes, in the end its music but, who we are is very intertwined within music and what we listen to has a fuckton (not for everyone) to do with who we are.  """"When I say you I don't mean you guys specifically but like people complaining about the set and saying it was all over the place, and how red rocks had way more flow or something. It's because he's trying to get it out to a broader audience and if you are already for the cause that something has to change in the way things are around us, then you got what was going on with the set. Again all my opinion :)"

bassnectar,3bua9l,mollifier,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"I found a couple on ebay and combined them into a super sticker. Both vinyl and on the outside of the glass, they dont get very dirty and have no peeling issues if you apply them right. The bass drop on the bottom is the second sticker, got lucky with the size. http://i.imgur.com/pUANiew.jpg"
bassnectar,3bua9l,backfromsolaris,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"etsy, but why do you want it on the inside?  better visibility outside, and they are always removable.  just buy some goo gone for the residue it leaves behind when you remove/replace it."
bassnectar,3brn6z,channel4newsman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"I'm considering it. Being in Denver, it's not a far drive, but im also doing a bunch of red rocks shows, ACL, and Tomorroworld, so it depends on if I can handle it financially."

bassnectar,3brn6z,RandomTechKid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, I expect this will be a close as he comes to Oklahoma. That's what is motivating me to go. I made the drive to red rocks. I can't miss this opportunity to see him again this year."

bassnectar,3brn6z,buds4hugs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"I went in 2013, first year they had camping, but as I live 10 minutes away I decided I'd rather have my bed at night. I hear it was fine, security left people alone, police presence wasn't overwhelming for the festival being right outside downtown KCMO. Get that ticket and I'll see you there. Maybe we can throw together a Reddit BBQ meetup, I know the good spots."
bassnectar,3brn6z,iFUBAR,2,Wed Jul 1 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going this year alone - first festival and first time seeing Bassnectar! Hit me up on that BBQ, I'll trade you my shirt for some ribs"
bassnectar,3brn6z,ecro1992,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:05 2015 UTC,I was thinking of doing the hotel route myself. I love camping festivals but you can never overestimate the value of a bed and air conditioning. I've pretty much decided I'm going though. I've gotta ask how high are your expectations for the new stage? Was it really good in the past?
bassnectar,3brn6z,Mad_Hatter_Bot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:11:14 2015 UTC,Tough call... I wouldn't expect anything mind blowing but any stage looks cool with a downtown skyline backdrop. Plus you're a couple hundred feed away from the river so there's usually a nice breeze
bassnectar,3brn6z,ecro1992,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about going to the nectar day if they have single day tickets. Was prolly going to drive down from Chicago, hit one day of the fest, chill in KC for a day, then head back home. Might still do 3 days but more leaning towards just one."
bassnectar,3brn6z,BAEsshead,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:16:58 2015 UTC,I'm from the burbs and that 1 day plan sounds pretty exciting if you're looking for more. Just throwing the idea out there since I'm focused on Bisco atm

Will prolly be like 3 of us tops driving down there in the end, so there should be room if you want to roll with. Meeting up with another crew down there so we'll be sitting pretty once we get down there."
bassnectar,3brn6z,wubwubs7,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:49:43 2015 UTC,"I'll be there! Haven't been before but I like the little baby festival vibe. You end up knowing everyone by Monday morning! Also the lineup is just.... Wow. I've been dying to see Porter. Then there's Party Favor, Slander, Datsik, Snails, etc. Whole lotta bangers in that lineup. Not to mention the king of the sound himself."

bassnectar,3bpgnf,tobygates,4,Wed Jul 1 04:52:48 2015 UTC,Not my favorite but still good stuff
bassnectar,3bpgnf,mingling4502,6,Wed Jul 1 04:17:25 2015 UTC,"you really did not deserve to be downvoted for that. unpopular opinions on here tend to get buried, but it's not my favorite either, in fact it's my least favorite mixtape by far simply because of the lack of mixing, more of a blendtape, i can setup 30sec transitions in iTunes between all the tracks if i wanted to. Still absolutely LOVE the MUSIC, but the ""mix"" leaves sooo much to be desired"
bassnectar,3bpgnf,Fatphillmargera,2,Wed Jul 1 15:29:18 2015 UTC,I made a thread about it last night but I deleted it because I didn't want to bring any negative vibes to the release day because I do love the album but the mixtape just makes me angry. I was expecting an immersive style mixtape and we just got the album press play with like 2 added songs. Along with mixing like 2 together. I feel so let down considering the reason I'm a bass head is because of his mixtapes. Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way because I feel so ungrateful I just know Lorin can do so much better.
bassnectar,3bpgnf,randomnoob1,2,Thu Jul 2 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed x10000. I don't get this mixtape at all. It sounds like it just kind of popped into his head a few days before releasing the album, and he just threw together the whole album as a continuous mix, then started playing with it but ran out of time. Sometimes there are real transitions, sometimes its an Itunes-crossfade, sometimes there's just gaps. It's certainly not a standard Nectar mix, just a continuous."
bassnectar,3bpgnf,Nfc24,2,Thu Jul 2 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"One of the things that got me so into Bassnectar was how effortlessly he mixed songs together in his other mixtapes. The genre could change entirely and you would hardly know it unless you were paying attention to it. On this mixtape I don't really feel this at all. It's not a bad album overall, but the mixtape was disappointing."

bassnectar,3bnn2l,Zenmaster7,4,Tue Jun 30 18:29:08 2015 UTC,"You know, being an avid fan, I tend to take out my phone at least a few times during a nectar show to either a) attempt to capture something on video or b) to see how much sweet nectar I have left.   For that Forest set I didn't pull out my phone once, not once. That was utterly beautiful and immersive music. What an amazing set. To anyone who experienced that <3"
bassnectar,3bnn2l,Pantsguy92,3,Wed Jul 1 02:28:17 2015 UTC,"thats the best way to experience bassnectar  ive never understood why people take videos during his shows. you were meant to experience that first hand at its fullest potential, not thru a 4 inch screen. like just for once people, LIVE IN THE MOMENT  who cares about taking the video. why do you need it? to remember? YOU WERE THERE. experience it the way it was meant to be experienced  btw none of this goes for people who record the whole sets, those people are awesome and takes real dedication. its good for the scene imo"
bassnectar,3bnn2l,Zenmaster7,2,Wed Jul 1 11:17:14 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. I was virtually sober for that set apart from a few beers and a bump of coke earlier in the day before I entered the venue. Though I did smoke a bleezy with Dimitri in it so that definitely doesn't qualify as sober, but I wasn't tripping or rolling I should've said. That DMT blunt and Nectar were the perfect combination of living in the moment. Nothing brings me in to the here & now as much as Dimitri (as odd as that may be)."
bassnectar,3bnn2l,Zenmaster7,2,Wed Jul 1 21:42:12 2015 UTC,"You know, being an avid fan, I tend to take out my phone at least a few times during a nectar show to either a) attempt to capture something on video or b) to see how much sweet nectar I have left.   For that Forest set I didn't pull out my phone once, not once. That was utterly beautiful and immersive music. What an amazing set. To anyone who experienced that <3"
bassnectar,3bnn2l,Pantsguy92,2,Wed Jul 1 02:29:38 2015 UTC,"OMG  first time i ever saw lorin play the bongo bong intro > kick snare in like 2012, that shit fucking ripped my face off. such a fucking heater. he was ending his encores with that track for a bit  i actually emailed Lorin on that one for track ID lol"
bassnectar,3bnn2l,Wootstapler,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:05:47 2015 UTC,Yup. First time I heard that combo was at the rave in Milwaukee
bassnectar,3bnn2l,Pantsguy92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:48:20 2015 UTC,the way he did it back then was way better. at eforest like you knew after the intro it was gonna be something other than bongo bong. on tour in like 2011 or 2012 he did the intro then boom it gave you no time to react and kick snare dropped. shit was wild
bassnectar,3bnn2l,bvsshevd,2,Mon Jul 6 11:02:52 2015 UTC,Who else lost their shit when he played that tiesto-knock you out remix AHHH sooooo good
bassnectar,3bnn2l,Jesse808,2,Wed Jul 1 14:00:19 2015 UTC,Did anyone checkout Minnesota ? cause his set was great and i wish his ser was recorded if anyone has it recorded
bassnectar,3bnn2l,ubbitz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's Deckscar's Face Off under the Freak acapella, it sounds kind of like it, but I think that's a whole different thing Lorin made for his own remix of Freak."
bassnectar,3bnn2l,ubbitz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:55:21 2015 UTC,Were people really bitching about this set?? That's crazy. Here's a little something to celebrate how badass of a set this was.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/uqlrt26xftbnfot/bassnectar%20-%20dead%20prez%20-%20it%27s%20bigger%20than%20hip%20hop%20mashup.mp3?dl=0

bassnectar,3bpss3,bigjim212,9,Wed Jul 1 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"Really doubt Lorin is just going to give up making music one day. He has devoted his life to it.   Worst comes to worst (for us) bassnectar may finish running its course and he'll end it but I think the man himself will be creating music until the day he dies.   At the end of the day all we can do is speculate, so it's best to not worry about it. Just enjoy the ride."
bassnectar,3bpss3,AnusDoobies,8,Wed Jul 1 05:30:38 2015 UTC,"he tweeted during the listening party last night that its our passion love personality and interactivity that drive him to continue, so I don't think he'll stop making music for awhile :). As for tours, someone posted on here awhile ago that his friend was pen pals with Lo and he said something along the lines of ""for the past few years I've been always doing whats best for Bassnectar, now I gotta start doing whats best for Lorin"", I support the fuck out of that. The man's given us so much, he deserves to chill back a little and enjoy all the hard work he's put into this! But he's definitely gonna tour less, I believe, and the shows that he DOES play will be way more immersive (think NYE, RR,etc.), or at least thats what you can infer from his post announcing the pre-orders for into the sun :)"
bassnectar,3bpss3,gufftupper,6,Wed Jul 1 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"i doubt he'll stop completely. but playing a different show every night on tour has gotta be fucking exhausting. not many DJs can do that ya know?  i dont think hes gonna stop playing shows or producing within in the next couple years, but i do think hes gonna slow it down and keep shows just to special events and 2-3 day runs at legendary venues and only play select festivals  that way each show is really really special"
bassnectar,3bpss3,Pantsguy92,5,Wed Jul 1 10:06:10 2015 UTC,I doubt it. This year will be his biggest year yet. He's got another album in the works and  expects to release it by year's end. He's got a fall/winter full of special events. He's collaborating with more artists than ever. He's got many more years left in him.
bassnectar,3bpss3,ermacforcekin,4,Wed Jul 1 10:53:49 2015 UTC,I can see him retiring and finally releasing his treasure cove of unreleased music as a bid farewell to the Bassnectar in him. One hopes he then puts on a new mask for us and dives into another culture of music much like Skrillex has done with his Dog Blood and Jack U projects.. After all we all know how much Lo loves collabing.. One can only hope for the best.
bassnectar,3bpss3,MrBoss93,5,Wed Jul 1 04:33:51 2015 UTC,I'll be damned if I'm not at the last show he ever plays. Imagine the insanity and the feels...
bassnectar,3bpss3,DropDoc,3,Wed Jul 1 05:49:46 2015 UTC,Part of me hopes that day never comes but the other part cannot wait to experience that epic post-set cry and group hug that I will create. We will fucking sob together.
bassnectar,3bpss3,Zenmaster7,5,Thu Jul 2 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"Other than there being no fall tour, I honestly don't really see why people think he's gonna retire soon. I know in a post he did say he was going to retire at some point, but he basically just announced a side project with jantsen, and ill.gates himself has posted on here saying that they have a number of unreleased collaborations for an EP. He's clearly still working hard at producing new music. Personally, I think he simply realized he needed more time for himself, and so instead of doing an entire tour, he's only doing festivals and special events"
bassnectar,3bpss3,NoWorries13,2,Wed Jul 1 16:42:23 2015 UTC,The day we know he'll be retiring soon is when he finally does a collaboration with DVS AKA PL
bassnectar,3bpss3,jawngoodman,7,Wed Jul 1 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone is still hyped up on this. PL is irrelevant in my eyes and has been for the past 2 years. I'd love to see those Tipper collabs, ZD collabs or some Ill-Gates/Nectar hidden gems"
bassnectar,3bpss3,BassLorin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:29:01 2015 UTC,For some reason I'd love to see Lorin and Polish Ambassador collab.
bassnectar,3bpss3,Zenmaster7,2,Thu Jul 2 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"The two have a very similar mindset, with the whole purpose of giving back, and I respect them both for it. I believe David is more forward thinking with his whole sustainability thing, but Lorin's approach is more logical and, therefore, more successful.  As for their music, I can see them doing something very cool."
bassnectar,3bpss3,BassLorin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:03:58 2015 UTC,The changes they could make would be unreal. Bassnectar spreading Polish's message along with his own to the cult following that is Bassheads. That shit would change the world.
bassnectar,3bpss3,Zenmaster7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:01:15 2015 UTC,THANK YOU
bassnectar,3bpss3,ponyofish,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"When you say 'irrelevant', I don't exactly know what you mean.  In what way is PL irrelevant? Whatever it is, it seems to have stemmed from your subjective view on music.  Of course this is just some fun surrounding the Basslights concept and the last AMA where he mentioned he needed to book studio time with Derek.  I can understand your view with the mentioned artists, however their production styles are on a very select dimensions somewhat similar (heavy bass, alien sounds, etc.).  I think BN and PL could make a smashing bass-infused hip hop track.  It would simply be interesting to see how their production styles integrate."
bassnectar,3bpss3,jawngoodman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:43:12 2015 UTC,"Seeing how he put out what was supposed to be a ""revolutionary album"" that didn't really change the game that much (ACMOTS) and doing nothing ever since besides making those hot shit mixes,  appearing sporadically yet randomly at festivals and congratulating himself on ACMOTS, I'd say that DVS is falling pretty quickly.  I think he said that because of their fan bases being similar and because they host a festival together (not to mention I doubt Lorin would explicitly say ""no way I'm working with PL"") but I feel like one of them would've at least hinted at it in some way by now. I dug PL for a long time but admittedly he really isn't doing much anymore.  If it happened I don't doubt it'll be dope, but I'd rather hear tracks of producers that are known to have hidden tracks with Lorin, not to mention ones that have been on their grind heavy for the past few years.  Idk. I'm hungover and this is just My $0.02"
bassnectar,3bpss3,BassLorin,4,Thu Jul 2 11:19:10 2015 UTC,"Gotta disagree. ACMOTS was a game changing album. The way that DVS created all of those samples organically, pressed them all to vinyl, and then recorded the samples from the vinyl tracks had never been done before to that extent. Within two years a good number of artists had put out albums that were created through collaboration and creating unique samples (BN w/ NVB, Griz w/ Say It Loud, Gramitik w/ TAOR). DVS really pushed the envelope with ACMOTS and I think electronic music as a whole benefitted from it.  I'm sure PL has something up his sleeve. I understand from interviews of his I've read that he's a lot like Lorin in the sense that he has a huge desire and passion for creating music. I'd be shocked if he were just touring for two years and not creating at all. He usually keeps his shit pretty close lipped though, so we won't know about it until it's ready, like a week before he releases it (fo free might I add).  Fuck I love both of these guys, super stoked to see them at Bisco in a couple weeks."
bassnectar,3bpss3,wubalubadubdub24,2,Thu Jul 2 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from concerning DVS's current positioning as an artist and performer.  Even some debate has been risen in /r/prettylights about DVS's drug use and stage presence.  That aside, I think it was innovative for him to build his own sample library for an entire album.  Luckily, he defined his fanbase early on who become extreme advocates, so no matter what he does (or doesn't) release, the fans would at least be about it. Lorin has unintentionally mastered this advocate marketing technique and so the fanbases are almost cult-like and have a bit of an overlap, but still remain different in ideals, style, and tastes.  I love both, honestly, because of my upbringing as a metalhead who also liked hiphop among other variables.   I guess the sounds they deliver are so clean that it would be cool to see that happens when they combine their minds.  You make a good point about Lorin passively addressing collaboration with DVS. Perhaps their relationship just exists in sharing the stage and not any tracks... who knows.  Lorin seems to be collaborating with active and ambitious producers and artists (even helping to start careers for some. see: Craz, Gnar Gnar, Jenna Sousa (15 fucking years old)) as well as proven artists from labels like VISION and OWSLA. I respect him for identifying those hot talents and leveraging it to deliver dope music.  I guess DVS chooses to innovate/conduct himself in a different fashion.  Idk. I'm wired on coffee and this is just My $0.02"
bassnectar,3bpss3,jawngoodman,2,Thu Jul 2 13:40:52 2015 UTC,"Even if one day it's not called Bassnectar, if it's Lorin, I'll be listening. The man has been on tour almost nonstop since I was in elementary school. I can't say I blame him for wanting to chill out a little. I don't think that means he'll just stop."
bassnectar,3bpss3,sourgangbang,2,Thu Jul 2 07:07:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too worried about it. Think of his new touring style as something similar to String Cheese Incident or Tipper. Less frequent stops, more genuine and excellent gathering experiences bringing the whole fam together.  Ever since he took a step back and announced there would be no fall tour, every set has been more unique and heartfelt than the past 2 years of touring IMHO."

bassnectar,3bpss3,gholladay,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:35:00 2015 UTC,He's already confirmed he is working on another album that he wants to release this year. The man tours almost none stop. Eventually he will slow down. But I don't see him stopping anytime soon.

bassnectar,3bnt15,EONS,3,Wed Jul 1 03:25:29 2015 UTC,Lorin called and wanted to play a song with them. They made a little skit talking to Lorin on the phone and brought out his puppet to rock along side Kyrian while they played Blow.
bassnectar,3bnt15,EONS,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:29:52 2015 UTC,"Also, Kyrian and the other dude were dancing around ass naked with a pizza box around their wastes and eventually take it off to reveal a sock on their dick like RHCP. Ironically they started singing ""it's bigger than dick socks, dick socks."" (Instead of hip hop). The night after Lorin played the original the night before xD"
