Borderlands2,3e3qkj,Muffinofrage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:11 2015 UTC,I was bloodlust krieg up until I got to the capstones. I respeced to try out melee krieg and after that I've pretty much became unkillable. I still miss my full on bloodlust playstyle though because it taught me how kickass vladof grenades are.
Borderlands2,3e20bg,iamnumberThor,16,Tue Jul 21 10:04:51 2015 UTC,Are you really fighting the level 53 dragons at level 40?  Let me know how that worked out for you.  Spoiler alert:  It's impossible
Borderlands2,3e20bg,Toph_a_loaf,4,Tue Jul 21 13:07:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah we didn't realise they would be so high. Only once we had paid the eridium and jumped into the pit did we see their level. We kind of ran around trying to dodge attacks. It was fruitless, obviously. We were just like ""this is our life now"" and then we knew that pit was the place we don't go anymore."
Borderlands2,3e20bg,too_oh_ate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this. Good lord that is just an exercise in frustration.  I think there is a cap on how much they can be leveled up, so you couldn't have started this at the right level, right?"
Borderlands2,3e20bg,Toph_a_loaf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:41 2015 UTC,"I think the Dragons always spawn at level 53 on TVHM no matter your level.  The way that enemy damage scales though is this.  If you are 3 or more levels below an enemy, your damage scales to 0.88 raised to the level difference.  So in this case, there is 13 levels of difference so 0.88 raised to the 13th power is 0.19 so you are only doing 19% of your normal damage to an enemy that has probably 100 or more times the health pool of a typical level 40 bad guy.  Basically you just wasted your time cause you can't kill the level 53 dragons at level 40."

All of those zillion loot chests you can open afterwards were full of GARBAGE. Also, they only dropped ONE legendary, and I forget what it was. Never doing that again.  Kill the damn shock one (blue) first. WHICHEVER DRAGON YOU SHOOT will land. So make sure you've got something uber accurate (I use a bitch) to get at them. Then I think we killed the fire or corrosive ones next.  The stupid last dragon levels everyone up, so DON'T SHOOT HIM or he'll land."

Borderlands2,3e4of8,ThibiiX,0,Tue Jul 21 22:50:10 2015 UTC,You won't get higher than 37-38 while you're in TVHM. Once you get in UVHM that will scale everytime you visite him.
Borderlands2,3e4of8,HanzsKlopek,2,Tue Jul 21 22:55:23 2015 UTC,You can get a level 50 one after finishing the main story missions.
Borderlands2,3e4of8,Slyzavh,2,Wed Jul 22 00:05:15 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer. You can still be in TVHM and get one at level 50.

Borderlands2,3e08p3,ScootaLewis,12,Mon Jul 20 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"Good to know. I would be lying if I didn't say I got lucky on this instance, but in the heat of the moment I just did what I could! Quick question though... Can you zoom in/change guns during the death timer? How about grenades?   Also, later on I died and I saw that it cost me some money to revive. What happens if I don't have any money when I die?  Sorry if these are dumb questions, figured there was no need to make a separate post to ask them and I didn't see anything about these in the FAQ."
Borderlands2,3e08p3,ScootaLewis,16,Mon Jul 20 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"You can change guns, but you can't zoom in, and you can't throw grenades outside of special circumstances (play axton and have the skill that allows it). I've never had it happen where I had zero money when respawning. It takes something like 7% of your current total when you respawn, I'd guess that 7% of 0 is 0."

Borderlands2,3e08p3,NoDogNo,6,Tue Jul 21 14:11:17 2015 UTC,Tediore guns make a good replacement for grenades.
Borderlands2,3e08p3,SnarkMasterRay,2,Tue Jul 21 00:48:26 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, I generally keep a fast-reloading tediore pistol or SMG for just such an occasion. Second wind?

I think I might be a bit above average when it comes to aptitude with these sorts of things, but I never really have the discipline to get myself formally educated or anything, with how much it costs and all, so I usually learn most of what I know through finding problems like these in video games that just bother the hell out of me and looking up everything I can about them.  This doesn't happen that often, so I have a very limited education on math. x) Most of the time I'm doing my research to solve a video game problem, a lot of the stuff being said is in a language I have little to no reference to understand. Although, it sounds a lot like Bernie Sanders really wants to make tuition for colleges free, so free college tuition in America seems feasible in the near future, so who knows? Maybe I'll achieve my dreams of getting a decent education on mathematics without ungodly costs.  I'm really glad that this was received so well.

I just randomly pressed each button once and a couple of again after trying to figure out what they did... and he popped out.  It was only after I killed him that I saw the lights on the wall. Guess I got really lucky.
Borderlands2,3e0wz7,dunks6666,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:14 2015 UTC,"Oooh, let's turn this into a math problem too! Keep this train going!   Well, since you didn't see the lights, I would presume you weren't eliminating choices or anything because you wouldn't even know that there were choices to eliminate.   So there's a 3.125 chance that any random combination will work. Since you weren't eliminating any choices, I guess you could find out how lucky you were with 1-(.96875t/3), .96875 because that's the likelihood of you failing, t/3 because I'm guessing it took you three seconds per light change, but I didn't test this or anything, I just imagined this in my head and I could be way, way off, probably entire seconds off. This is just a half assed estimation. 1- because I wanted to turn it into the likelihood you would succeed.   So just put however many seconds you think you were doing it in t and you shall know how lucky you were! Or, if you know how many times you changed the lights, put that number in place of t/3 and you'll have an even more accurate answer! Unless I did something wrong! (Does b2 sanity check)"

Borderlands2,3dzsr3,buttsalt14,-13,Tue Jul 21 04:18:44 2015 UTC,"AH yes, pretty famous glitch. My advice is to toss the PS4 and buy build (cheaper) a PC so that you can experience those awesome liquid graphics courtesy of NVidia.   ITT: butthurt"
Borderlands2,3dzsr3,James_Locke,8,Mon Jul 20 23:29:41 2015 UTC,"I never tried that method. So to fix this glitch, I just have to sell my PS4, spend a bit more on a good gaming PC, then restart the game up until I reach the lootsplosion again? I have never thought of that."
Borderlands2,3dzsr3,buttsalt14,-13,Mon Jul 20 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be much more, but you can take solace in the fact that the games will be cheaper, run better, wont have discs to scratch, wont have to pay for the internet connection, and will still be able to play with any USB controller!"

Borderlands2,3dzsr3,buttsalt14,-7,Tue Jul 21 00:45:00 2015 UTC,Of course! But it is still a legitimate solution to a problem
Borderlands2,3dzsr3,James_Locke,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"In what way is that a legitimate solution? If you take your car to the mechanic and he says ""whelp, better buy a new car, yours sucks"" would you consider that a solution?"
Borderlands2,3dzsr3,savagewinds,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:11:46 2015 UTC,It was tongue in cheek. DOnt take gaming so seriously.
Borderlands2,3dzsr3,James_Locke,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly everyone says that the games are cheaper but that's not always the case. I see a ton of PC people get hyped over new releases and but them for $60 just like console players, except console players can also sell the game for $30-40 in a few months after they're done playing it.  I got battlefield4 and AC black flag for $35 each a little before holiday season 2013 (when they were still $60 each reg price). I still play BF4 and after 30 hours of black flag I sold it for $42 to Target during a triple trade in promotion or something like that.  Yeah console players can get screwed over spending $60 on a 1.5 year old game at a walmart that is way cheaper on PC but if you know where to look for sales and deals and find good trade in bonuses to return them for you'll probably spend less overall on games for PC (I don't really want to discuss the option of piracy that PC has because that's not the argument)."
Borderlands2,3dzsr3,RidiculousNicholas55,2,Tue Jul 21 05:39:40 2015 UTC,They're not always cheaper on PC. Especially as the game gets older. I'm pretty sure you could get a disk copy of COD black ops for like $20 but I still see it on Steam as $60. Also a disk copy of Borderlands 1 is like $10 but on Steam it's $20.
Borderlands2,3dzsr3,buttsalt14,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"Do games really run better? Steam constantly crashes for me. Windows is a shit OS that is not stable or user friendly.

Borderlands2,3e14h9,zerocasper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:12:57 2015 UTC,Should I use a Hawkeye then? And I eagerly await these improvements.
Borderlands2,3e14h9,zerocasper,0,Tue Jul 21 11:24:25 2015 UTC,"No the Hawkeye is not that good on zer0. There are better sniper riffles. Also since you have speced in critical ascension i am going to assume that you are playing as sniper zer0. For sniper zer0 you need to remove all the points you have in precision, since sniper riffles do not need  extra accuracy. Instead of precision spec 5 points into At 0ne with the Gun. Remove the 2 points you have at C0unter Strike and the 1 point at Unf0rseen. Instead put one more point in Rising Sh0t, Fearless and Innervate. If you are going to rely mostly on pimpernels as sniper zero then two-fang is a good skill. Otherwise if you are going to use high fire rate snipers then it is not as good. Now for the Bloodshed tree it is up to anyone's preference. I prefer to put 5 points into killing blow and 0 points at Ir0n hand. However if you are more comfortable with the extra health then stay with Iron Hand."
Borderlands2,3e14h9,OrigamiSalami777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:06 2015 UTC,It looks solid but no one can really judge it everyone has there own play style and if that build fits yours it's fine

Borderlands2,3e14h9,iammyusername,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:05:15 2015 UTC,do you play solo or with a group? that makes a significant difference on your spec.   can you tell me more about your overall build? what guns are you using other than the pimp and bekah. do you use different elemental pimps and use them the majority of time? what shield are you using. relics?  I have about 250 hours of playtime on zero and can give input. i already have thoughts but am looking for more info to give a good response.

Borderlands2,3dxvdt,zerocasper,3,Mon Jul 20 12:52:19 2015 UTC,"Seems like 90% of these would be 30 minutes of people dying to Ultimate Badasses and the Assassins. It's extremely hard to kill OP8 enemies with crap gear. And I don't think most people would want to go through that, let alone watch it happen to someone else. Gonna have to pass on this."
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,CokeFryChezbrgr,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:22 2015 UTC,I changed the banned gear. Should be better now. Also it does not have to be a 30 minute run. You can do it in 12 minutes with only whites too. Anyways i may have been a bit too strict. I hope things are better now ;)

Borderlands2,3dxvdt,SuperJazzHands,3,Mon Jul 20 13:16:40 2015 UTC,I'm gonna do the same. A ban list seems counter productive as everyone can get the same gear within the game. This no longer appeals to me.
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,ThePostm4n,2,Mon Jul 20 15:30:41 2015 UTC,Damn. I noticed that there are other people who feel the same way and i just wanted to ask for your opinion on sth. Do you think that there should be no bans at all? I mean only 19 weapons are banned for each class. There are thousands in the game. Or should there be some but not that many?
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,831pm,0,Mon Jul 20 16:28:03 2015 UTC,theres no problem but you could give it at least a try. I dont think i will do great either but it is gonna be fun ;).
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,sadllamas,2,Mon Jul 20 13:50:11 2015 UTC,You might want to put something like no glitches into the rules since it's not technically forbidden while defeating the purpose of the challenge.
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,ChaoticSmiley,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:32:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice :)
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,ChaoticSmiley,2,Mon Jul 20 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"I think the bans will guarantee a CA stacking zer0 will easily win this.  You've also eliminated melee zer0, which is probably the most advanced and dynamic play style in the game.  I can do an Axton run but I imagine all of the runs will look similar."
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,ChaoticSmiley,0,Mon Jul 20 18:18:53 2015 UTC,CA zer0 will be strong thats true but there are other playstyles that can win it. I havent eliminated melee zer0. In fact not a single item a melee zer0 needs is banned.
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,ShinkuTear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:17 2015 UTC,"You could consider changing the ""Banned Gear"" list to a handicap list. Anyone who uses any piece of gear on the list gets an automatic score reduction.  Though if you go that route, it might make more sense to change the scoring system to a ""low score"" system - where the goal is to get the lowest score possible. In this case, any handicaps or rarity penalties would add to the score, rather than subtract. Something like a minimum score of 10, with it going up based on the scoring factors."
Borderlands2,3dxvdt,ChaoticSmiley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:31 2015 UTC,"I like this, I think this is the better way of doing it."

Borderlands2,3dxvdt,vzDesirezv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"I'm still interested! But as sadllamas said, i think instead of banned, the gear should be handicapped.

You can unlock OP levels after you reach level 72 by completing Digistruct Peak.

What I've figured out so far, from this Reddit and 2 marathon days over the weekend:   Shift codes are annoying to enter. Golden Keys sound like they aren't useful after level 50, so you should redeem 100+ of them and average 2 every level. The Loot the World app is a really cool idea. Stamps seem to be rare though, so use it sparingly until 50+ so you can get some good items for 50-63. Weapon manufacturers seem to matter, but are really complicated. Some weapons may be way better than nearly identical weapons. Talent builds don't seem to be very complicated. There seem to be very few 'bad' talents. I've only paid attention to assassins though. Eridium bars are very important. If you get enough money, you can farm them from slot machines at about a 5% rate to max your inventory space relatively early. Money is pretty easy to get and doesn't have too many uses. Was really stressed about looting every chest at the beginning, but am losing caring since there are rarely any items worth buying and the only thing I spend it on is ammo. Dying seems to be a % of money, so no big deal.   I got to level 23 this weekend, just through the nature preserve on the story. Heard someone finished recently at 33?

Borderlands2,3dxdyb,_sLAUGHTER234,2,Mon Jul 20 09:15:41 2015 UTC,"I have an explosive build that can vary between 2 or 3 different COMs and Reaper is probably the ""Utility"" COM - Less raw damage, but easier play style.  Skill build with Slag Rapier, + 3 out of the following: Kerblaster, Ogre, SwordSPLOSION, Carnage. Love Thumper, Explosive Relic, Explosive Fastball to round it all out. The alternative COM's for this would be either a Blood Blister, or a Flesh Crunch. You can change the points in StV to FtM if you want to ensure more consistency with your Melee hits.  The main goal is just to cycle through your Bloodlust. Use RtB as your safety net after getting Health Gated, but you should get decent health back on kill. Use grenades a ton. The 6/5 FtF will basically turn your Rapier into a Slagga while the skill is up. 10/5 BO + 5/5 StV makes your melee cycle pretty vicious. Use those fastballs.   Was a really fun build and makes for a change of pace from the typical Mania/Bloodlust or AFK-Hellborn builds."
Borderlands2,3dxdyb,likwidstylez,2,Mon Jul 20 11:52:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, this looks neat. I've tried this type of build before, but not with this particular skill tree setup. I definitely had less points in Bloodlust and more in Hellborn, is this looks like it'll play slightly differently. I'll try this spec out and see how it performs.

Borderlands2,3dvlth,Noirgheos,6,Sun Jul 19 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"I find Zer0 to be the easiest character overall. Very good damage, very good action skill, decent leveling, decent survivability. Not bad."
Borderlands2,3dvlth,8988303682,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"It varies from person to person since everyone has their own playstyle. For me, Axton was the easiest while I actually had quite a bit of trouble with Sal until I got enough points in Incite. People say Zer0 because he generally tends to be the hardest for most.  Also, you were using a Bekah, which is one of the most powerful weapons in the game, as well as one of the best characters for said weapon, so of course things will naturally feel easier than if you were using different guns."
Borderlands2,3dvlth,brandpanz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"How many mags did it take to kill the Warrior for you? I was using an OP8 Bekah on a non-OP Warrior, that was 72. Took me five full 16 round mags. Don't think I scored any crits, this is without Slag as well."
Borderlands2,3dvlth,brandpanz,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:39 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly how many, but I usually use SWORDSPLOSION to kill bosses (Warrior included), which isn't as strong as the Bekah.  Killing time doesn't really matter to me though; I use Axton because his playstyle and weapon choices fit me best out of all the characters.  edit: if you're using OP8 gear against OP0 enemies then of course things are going to be easy, you're basically killing enemies 8 levels below you"
Borderlands2,3dvlth,CDRE_JMButterfield,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:39:52 2015 UTC,I have a Swordsplosion and Harold in my other slots. Use them for close range.
Borderlands2,3dvlth,dunks6666,4,Sun Jul 19 22:50:07 2015 UTC,I don't think that there's any sort of difficulty involved when using OP8 guns on an OP0 enemy
Borderlands2,3dvlth,dunks6666,0,Mon Jul 20 00:24:42 2015 UTC,"Not really, none at all, but it seems underwhelming, the amount of damage being done."
Borderlands2,3dvlth,brandpanz,2,Mon Jul 20 01:14:20 2015 UTC,"It depends on play style, utilisation of weapons and the gear itself. Give a Salvador a grog and Harold and he can destroy everything, but without the right gear he can be very difficult to use effiecently. Personally Maya and Gaige are the easiest for me: Maya can disable almost any foe, has multiple ways to slag with guns or grenades and has numerous damage buffs good for end game. Legendary Cat class mod is scary powerful.  Gaige is very easy- after level 28 or so she has access to all of her most useful skills- anarchy, close enough, buck up, discord etc. and building her like this is very powerful.  I feel like kreig can also be very easy- get him any decent roid shield and his buzzaxe packs a punch.  I personally have never liked Axton, and his turrets have always been to frail and weak for me, however some say he is good, I just don't see it.   Zero has the steepest learning curve, especially since his skill is based around timings, however get him a slag rapier and roid with execute and many must fall and you can face roll OP8"
Borderlands2,3dvlth,dunks6666,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:00 2015 UTC,"Right now, like I said, I have an Antagonist for slagging, and a Florentine for slagging as well, and a Bekah to do damage. If you have Steam, would you be willing to help me make a nice skill set for maximum damage out of the Bekah?"
Borderlands2,3dvlth,brandpanz,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:01 2015 UTC,Sorry I don't have steam
Borderlands2,3dvlth,dunks6666,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"The turret can tank for you at any level once you get Longbow Turret. Once you know how to use it right, you can aggro any enemy in the game and make even OP8 into a cakewalk.  I like Axton the most though because I like single-element builds in games, and Axton's the best character for that in BL2. He also has a ton of defensive capability (including the amazing Grit), but his synergy with things that go boom is what I like the most about him."

As long as you have Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack 1 installed (which you do if you're in UVHM), you should gain experience! So I don't exactly know what would cause you to cap at 50.  Edit: I'm sorry, that last bit might actually be wrong. I should really do my research before answering.  ""Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is unlocked for a character once they have completed the main story missions in True Vault Hunter Mode and reached level 50. Unlike other playthroughs, Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode can be replayed multiple times with players able to reset their overall mission progress at any time from the Main Menu. No more tutorial missions -- characters in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode begin in Southern Shelf with the Cleaning Up the Berg mission. While playing in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, enemies and bosses will scale according to the player's current level or, if playing with others, the highest-level player in that party."" -Gearbox  So I guess Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack 1 isn't actually required. Short answer is: you can play UVHM, but you won't level beyond 50 unless you have the upgrade pack. Also everything will be capped at 50, since enemies and missions scale to the players level."

Borderlands2,3dnh0y,APM001,4,Fri Jul 17 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know the math off hand, but in my experience a 20K corrosive bullet will do more damage (although not much more, this is about the breaking point) to a robot than a 40k normal bullet will."
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,too_oh_ate,3,Fri Jul 17 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't use elementals at all in NVHM, then nothing but elementals in TVHM, and in UVHM I figured it'd be the same story even with slag thrown into the mix, but what do you think about the Lyuda? I mean the bullet splitting into 3 surely would tip the scale in its favor, right?"
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,too_oh_ate,2,Fri Jul 17 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"As you increase in difficulty (TVHM --> UVHM) the damage multiplier for elementals increases, to the point where you really shouldn't use a non-corrosive against a robot (and so on), unless the gun is an absolute beast (e.g. Siren w/Sandhawk + Bee). Not sure if you know this, but you absolutely must be using slag to get even more bonus (x3 damage in UVHM I believe). Without slagging stuff you are making it way more difficult on yourself.  Lyuda is personally not my cup of tea. Yes it splits, but how often do all bullets hit? They certainly won't all hit a crit spot. The Pimpernel is far superior, and a guaranteed drop, so no farming needed. In UVHM I would recommend you try to get the Gentlemen prefix (required), and an electric version.  Good luck!"
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,brandpanz,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"Barking's better than Gentleman's, you get more base damage as opposed to Gentleman's where you sacrifice some base damage for a mediocre crit bonus."
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,too_oh_ate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"While I agree that electric isn't hands down the best element to get, I strongly disagree that Barking is better than Gentlemen prefix.   Gentlemen is a 120% crit damage bonus. Since the Pimpernel's bullets split in the way they do, its possible to get multiple crit hit from one bullet - it far exceeds any additional base damage the Barking prefix has, its not even close."
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,brandpanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:11 2015 UTC,"For your average weapon, the crit bonus is:  base damage * 2 * (1 + (bonus))   For most snipers, the bonus is 100%, resulting in 4x the base damage on a crit. The crit accessory adds 20% to this 100%, resulting in the 120% on the card, and yielding:  base damage * 2 * (1 + 1.2) = base damage * 4.4   Now the damage accessory adds 15% to the base damage, which gives:  base damage * 1.15 * 2 * (1 + 1) = base damage * 4.6   Therefore, a +damage sniper will almost always perform better than a +crit sniper with otherwise matching parts, especially on the Pimpernel since you have to make a bodyshot in order to get all the pellets to crit.  Now, if you were using the Bee, the crit accessory would be better: the amp damage is added to the base damage, which thus makes the damage accessory's effect almost negligible. But this is Pimpernel Zer0 (aka the highest-DPS build in the game) we're talking about, so do we really need the Bee for it?"
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,too_oh_ate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"Thoroughly and clearly explained, thank you. I'll be going after the Barking next time."
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,8988303682,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"Adding on to what /u/brandpanz said, it's probably not best to get a shock version. I would recommend a fire/corrosive version and just get a different weapon of the opposite element."
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,brandpanz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:13:20 2015 UTC,This is very true. Slag turns the vast majority of shields into putty. Shield stripping is still helpful (especially against bosses like W4R-D3N) but for general mobbing it's not needed too often.
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:20:16 2015 UTC,Roger that. I haven't looked into legendary drop rates yet; I'll look into farming once I hit level cap ^
Borderlands2,3dnh0y,nakedapedude,2,Fri Jul 17 21:36:29 2015 UTC,"Elemental damage is great especially in UVHM mainly due to the damage multiplier and how elemental guns interact with slag. Pretty much the only benefit of non-elemental guns is that they typically aren't weak against anything.  That being said, the Lyuda is such a good gun that you may be better off sticking with it for a few levels. The crit modifier is excellent and the pellet splitting will make its DPS much higher than any non-unique elemental sniper of the same level, as long as you can consistently crit and ideally land all 3 pellets."

Borderlands2,3dks2y,kweeleeyuh,4,Fri Jul 17 03:01:11 2015 UTC,Shield seems super awesome. Turtle shields make health gating a lot easier. Health gating means that if your HP is above 50% it is impossible for you to be killed by a single source of damage. Given each classes abilities to restore health and the shields natural regeneration rate turtle shields make Heath Gating a ton easier.

There is no real ""best"" character, but a ""Rocket Man"" Axton build is arguably the best build in the game. Don't look for best, look for what you enjoy, because there isn't a huge competitive edge in a game like this.   People don't max out skill trees because not all of the skills in a tree are effective or necessary for their build. And if you max out skill trees, you can't get as many different kinds of skills from other skill trees.   Playing the game with friends is super fun, but I completed my first 3 full characters by myself, and I loved it. It's fun playing with friends, but it's also good to be able to get engrossed in the game."
Borderlands2,3doghw,CBTJ,3,Sat Jul 18 00:06:49 2015 UTC,I started with Krieg and didn't enjoy playing with him. So I started over again with Axton and completed both NVHM and TVHM  (now level 60 in UVHM). After that I decided to try Maya and I fell in love .. see you just need to find the right character for you. Are you aggressive or more stealthy ? Axton is a good choice to start and complete a first playthrough. I played a bit with a friend but I mostly play solo and it is just as much fun ... UVHM is a real challenge but it's very rewarding.

Personally I started with Gaige the Mechromancer and played her till half TVHM. Then I played Maya and I absolutely loved her and her skills. I've recently started UVHM with her. Right now I'm playing as Salvador and I'm planning to level him up a bit before switching back to Maya.
Borderlands2,3doghw,596Franky,2,Sat Jul 18 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Maya is such a fun character. Do you like Salvador? I loved playing as Maya and then switched to Sal and found it had kind of the same feeling"
Borderlands2,3doghw,CBTJ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I like playing Salvador but I have to admit levelling with Maya was way funnier. It seems like Salvador relies a lot on skills and gear, but then again I'm still level 14, it will most likely feel better when I'll have more skill points and better gear."
Borderlands2,3doghw,596Franky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would say that Salvador has some of the most interesting skills (Sexual Tyrannosaurus, 'nuff said), but Maya has the great feeling of pulling an enemy out of combat and then killing all of his friends while he twitches up in the air. When you get to level 16 and can get the middle skill tree (game changer) skill, things will get interesting, and then when you get to level 31 you can really morph your character. My suggestion is slag in one hand, explosives in the other"
Borderlands2,3doghw,CBTJ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say there is a best character. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. I think the only character I had any grief with was Zer0 and that is because he has poor mobbing skills. He is ridiculously strong for raid bosses but will need help getting there.     If you are just playing normal and true vault mode you don't need friends but it is always fun to have some to play with! Ultimate mode was literally made for party play style. Enemies regenerate, have ridiculous amounts of health and towards the end can kill you in two hits (Never one, the game is designed where the damage hits a threshold and gives you at least one more hit).  That being said feel free to add me (8thLight - SteamID)"
Borderlands2,3doghw,wushupenguin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"It all depends, if you want a broken good character go with a salvador or a fibber gaige, if you want to have fun id recommend zero or krieg."
Borderlands2,3doghw,Subvs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"My first Character was Zero the Assassin, and I played with him all the way to OP 8  He was my favorite.  I love the sniper/stealthy game mode so it was great for me.  I then played the Commando to OP 8.  I am now currently playing as Kreig the Psycho, and I have to say.  He is Awesome.  His comments are hilarious and his Buzz Axe Rampage is so much fun to use.  There really is no best character in the game, it's all about what you enjoy.  I personally never liked Axton, because you  are relying on a turret to save you, and that ain't my style, but if it's yours.  Great! Experiment a little, see what you like.  There are tons of videos on youtube that show you gameplay of the characters.  I wish you good luck on your Borderlands 2 adventure!  Happy Looting!"
Borderlands2,3doghw,Inflamed_Gaming,0,Sat Jul 18 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"Salvador is the best end game for raiding, however he is horrible levelling up. Kreig, maya and gaige are all very good for levelling. Axton is garbage and zero has the toughest learning curve.  If you mean fully max out, then you don't get enough skill points to do so, but if you mean they don't get the capstone then it's because not all the skills are good in every tree. Friends can make the game more fun, but it also makes the game more difficult- as more people join, slag and health multipliers change"
Borderlands2,3doghw,dunks6666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:29:40 2015 UTC,Why is axton so bad and zero so hard?
Borderlands2,3doghw,CBTJ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:47:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think /u/dunks6666 really means Axton is garbage. I personally love playing as Axton, it's just that in OP8 (the max level) his turrets get chewed through super quickly, making them pretty useless. But he has great skills other than his action skill.   I would agree that Zer0 is hard to play, because his two main builds (sniping and melee) involve a lot of knowledge of the skills and take a lot of skill to pull off successfully.  And it's true that the game gets harder, but if you coordinate well, it'll usually be better to have more people (balances out)"
Borderlands2,3doghw,Ceruleanlunacy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"Axton is a fun character, with some great dialogue, but at higher levels, where highly specialised skills and tactics are needed, his advantages are too non-specific to be incredibly useful, and you may find yourself going down a lot. He is however a very good entry-level character and is a lot of fun.  Zero's curve is quite steep, because a lot of his skills are based on situational things, or having enemies set up just right, as well as the fact that at times, maps can vary to be problematic for both his melee and sniping trees independently or occasionally together."
Borderlands2,3doghw,dunks6666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"Axton is just poor late game. His turrets go down too quick and he doesn't have any  reliable damage buffs.  Zero isn't necessarily difficult, but he has the steepest learning curve out of all the characters, due to the others being simple and zero revolves a lot around timing. He gets some incredible buffs late game, but in can be difficult to level him up as well."

If you don't pick any of the four Echo recorders for the quest, you'll get to a room that has a guaranteed spawn of 4 Legendary Loot Midgets. These LLMs drop good loot, and four of them in one place is pretty efficient. Hence, players will take this quest, but never finish it so they can keep farming the four LLMs over and over for Legendary and Pearlescent gear."

If you have the mission to get the robot human stuff, take that. The reward is the Fibber which is absolutely amazing with Gaige. You could try out the first few missions of UVHM to decide if you want to play on that difficulty. If not you could just start new characters."
Borderlands2,3dlf59,buttsalt14,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:17 2015 UTC,You'd still have to reach TVHM on the other characters first. Just because you beat it with Gaige doesn't mean you can choose another character to run through it. Meaning you would still have to go through normal mode first for any character you choose. (Sorry in advance if I am not understanding your question correctly)
Borderlands2,3dlf59,wushupenguin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:24:32 2015 UTC,I've already beat the game on normal mode with the rest of the characters so TVHM is the next step.
Borderlands2,3dlf59,wushupenguin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:05:38 2015 UTC,Oooh my bad. In that case it depends if you have people to co-op with. UVHM is a lot more fun when you got partners to get through with it (Although Gaige is strong enough to do mostly everything on her own until around OP6-8). Try farming a good fibber and bee shield first. Deadly combo if you get the right fibber.

Compared with the how to videos I've seen on the subject though, I don't think it works quite the same way.  It doesn't merge the effect on to a target weapon, rather it seems like a buff my character inherits.  Any of the weapons that I switch to have the -1 ammo on shot, and single ammo use weapons become unlimited, but I can freely switch between any weapon I have equipped at that point until the game sees a vladof launcher again anyways."
Borderlands2,3djm7h,kurvyyn,2,Thu Jul 16 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"witch to have the -1 ammo on shot, and single ammo    How do you do that -1 ammo? cause I might be interested in trying that out"
Borderlands2,3djm7h,kurvyyn,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:29 2015 UTC,"Snag a vladof launcher, switch to that weapon and fire off a shot until the next round would be the free round, once you are in that position in the clip trigger a reload, IMMEDIATELY switch to another weapon, then IMMEDIATELY open your inventory and manually swap the slots for the launcher and the weapon you switched to.  You should have -1 ammo on shot on your character.  It will last until you switch back to a vladof launcher or encounter an enemy that has one.  For a weapon that consumes a single shot, infinite ammo (I like bitch + bee or striker for this), and for all other weapons it still reduces the one shot per so you get a bit more mileage before a reload on the Unkempt Harold and whatnot.    You can switch the vladof out of the your weapons and back to inventory so you don't accidentally switch to the weapon and cancel out your -1 ammo on shot effect.  I can't seem to get that last part to work with Rubi or Grog Nozzle, if I de-equip those I lose the heal.  Could be I'm doing something wrong there or I don't understand the glitch entirely, but sacrificing one or 2 slots for heal + infinite ammo is pretty good."

Borderlands2,3dhhy5,Lusankya,3,Thu Jul 16 10:10:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was pretty tired and overall frustrated when I posted.  Here's a screenshot from when I tried to switch to an online mode: http://i.imgur.com/cWKvftT.jpg  I was able to find my old characters, and select them. But today I actually tried to start a game and this showed up: http://i.imgur.com/kO6UB4X.png  No error messages at all for FIFA. It just looks like it's about to launch, and just doesn't. Starting to think the power outage caused a problem for my hard drive or something."
Borderlands2,3dhhy5,Lusankya,3,Thu Jul 16 15:33:15 2015 UTC,"It's cool.  We've all been there.  I'd start by verifying the game cache in Steam.  A proper, uncorrupted installation should never be vomiting stack traces up in error messages.  Here's Valve's guide on how to do this.  It may also be worthwhile to run chkdsk to be sure you don't have some corruption elsewhere from an ungraceful shutdown (i.e. the power outage).  Here's a guide on how to do this in Windows 7.  Try out both of those, and post back with your results.  Good luck!"
Borderlands2,3dhhy5,Lusankya,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"Tried both, still not working. Out of desperation, uninstalled, then reinstalled. Still nothing. Any other ideas? I'm considering backing up everything important and reinstalling Windows, at this point. Unless the problem is somehow only with these 3 games,but that seems unlikely."
Borderlands2,3dhhy5,Lusankya,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:42 2015 UTC,"Have you tried reinstalling the drivers for your various components?  Start with your video card, and then your motherboard components (specifically for chipset).  If you're really desperate, ""sfc /scannow"" will verify your entire Windows installation to check for problems in there, but it can take a while and may not fix the issue.  If you make it through both of those, you could try reinstalling Windows, but installing all your drivers and running SFC is almost the same thing.  Generally I see reinstalling as an act of last resort, but if you're willing, it's a practically guaranteed fix (after also installing drivers, of course)."
Borderlands2,3dhhy5,Lusankya,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"I tried the sfc scannow, and it returned that it found corrupt files but was unable to fix some.

I realized that I left all my discs back home, so I think I'm stuck with this for now."

Borderlands2,3df35r,mightybonk,3,Wed Jul 15 22:29:18 2015 UTC,You get the rewards again.   Bonus: any quest that you don't accept scales to level 50 once you kill the warrior. This means that you can avoid the quests with the best rewards until after you finish the second playthrough and get them at a higher level than you would have otherwise.

E-tech launchers, though. I always carry a Topneaa with me. Reduced ammo consumption and fast fire rate is so good for clearing mobs and getting second winds."
Borderlands2,3dean6,DekuNut,5,Wed Jul 15 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"I think only accurate and high fire rate Spikers are worthwhile. So, Hyperion with Vladof barrel, if possible.  Darts though? Oh man, darts are my bag!  Get a dart and you can put a dozen into a stalker before it even KNOWS it's supposed to hide/evade. Shield stripped at least. Bee shield? Thing dies before it knew you were there.  Plasmacasters are great.  Splatterguns are horrible, horrible weapons. I can't hit anything with them. Splash damage too small, ammo consumption too high. I sell every splattergun ASAP. So disappointed to spend a golden key and get a freakin' Splattergun."
Borderlands2,3dean6,mightybonk,5,Wed Jul 15 22:14:11 2015 UTC,Love my SMG plasma casters.

Borderlands2,3dean6,Warhawg01,3,Wed Jul 15 18:18:57 2015 UTC,You can crit with them. I fought Mister Tinder snowflake not too long ago and was building  critical ascencion stacks with an incendiary E-Tech Vladof sniper. I do agree though. The damage they cause for the ammo they expend makes them bad for general play. I rarely have one on me and only really use them to dump on one tough enemy every now and again.
Borderlands2,3dean6,FalloutFanatic,6,Wed Jul 15 18:52:16 2015 UTC,I think what he meant to say was they have a much lower critical hit modifier than regular snipers.
Borderlands2,3dean6,CDRE_JMButterfield,5,Wed Jul 15 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"I looked it up and you are correct, so that is probably what he meant."

Plasma casters are really powerful and kill quickly but I tend not to use them because they burn ammo, aren't quite as accurate and the projectiles are slow.  The shotgun/splatguns are strong but I tend not to use them because i like to get close to enemies with shotguns and the splatguns can kill you.  The assault rifles are junk and the pistols even worse."
Borderlands2,3dean6,OGNick,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:48 2015 UTC,"I only regularly use plasma casters, and of those, typically only Hyperion/Maliwan/Tediore, in that order. I'll use splatguns if I find them and it's an element that I need/want, and I've occasionally used the rocket launchers. Darts/spikers/snipers/blasters are trash to me though.

When the quest reward that is favorable pops up, just alt tab then set your save file back to read and write and save and exit normally.

Borderlands2,3de78k,iammyusername,3,Wed Jul 15 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"First little trick; know the spawns. Reeth and Rouf are easy to dodge, so pose the least threat. Oney has the most health, so imo should be focused first.  Go stand near Reeth and phaselock Oney as soon as they spawn. If you focus him with your bees up, he should be down in seconds.  Probably best to go for Wot next (if you're using bees), with basically the same strategy, dodge the attacks of others, focus him while he's phaselocked.  During the time your skills are on cooldown (zer0 and Maya at least), don't worry about doing Damage. All you should be doing then is keeping yourself above healthgate.  Make sure you have Grog Nozzles or Rubis (you can farm for a bladed Rubi, no way to legit get a Bladed Grog Nozzle), and some good grenades. Storm Front is probably the best to go with, since you can just throw one and hold your grog nozzle and you'll always keep above health gate.  I've only ever solo'd the OP levels, but in my experience you definitely want to focus them one at a time, and use your skills to do that. Best of luck."
Borderlands2,3de78k,vSmash__,2,Wed Jul 15 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much a solid plan, but I'd argue they Reeth should be prioritized above all the Assassins, as his fire DOTs can be a huge pain in the ass. Otherwise, this is the way to go OP"
Borderlands2,3de78k,_sLAUGHTER234,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:24:36 2015 UTC,"With a group,  2 people can toss a few singularity grenades in a pattern to draw Them together in the first few seconds, and a solid phaselock will converge them into a pile with b0re and chain reaction going. Even with mediocre gear it isn't hard to drop 2 by the end of the first phaselock. Lay a trail of singularity nades spaced a second or two apart til phaselock 2 is ready and if it went half right there's only one left. If timing is perfect you can do it with like 7-8 nades total and not take a hit."

Borderlands2,3dbc63,transframer,4,Wed Jul 15 19:04:04 2015 UTC,"Bahroo isn't the end all/be all of borderlands mechanics, actually compared to most of the regulars on the GBX forums, his knowlage is pretty limited. As I have never seen him present any math or evedence of testing behind any of his claims, I will go with the guys on the forums, thank you.  Caveat: the Lyuda is significantly easier to use, so if this was a list of the best snipers for new/inexperienced/people who don't want to learn weird weapon mechanics, I would agree."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,wingsday1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:47 2015 UTC,Why do you love the Lyuda so much? Because Bahroo said to.
Borderlands2,3dbc63,buttsalt14,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:26 2015 UTC,I'm assuming that wasn't directed at me lol
Borderlands2,3dbc63,wingsday1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:07:43 2015 UTC,Nope not directed at you. Wasn't sure if it was very clear who it was for.
Borderlands2,3dbc63,buttsalt14,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:52:46 2015 UTC,"Correct, I cited him only to show that I'm not alone claiming this. Personally I tried both and I find Lyuda much better than Pimp. And even  if you do a DPS calculation you'll see it's better. But I agree I use it most of the times with infinite ammo and that makes heavy use if its big fire rate."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,transframer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"Some math: Lyuda: 736974 damage at level 80 Pimp: 608973 damage at level 80  Lyuda: 1473948 Crit damage (unmodified) at level 80 Pimp: 1217946 Crit damage (unmodified) at level 80  Lyuda: 4421844 all pellet Crit damage (unmodified) at level 80 Pimp: 6089730 all pellet Crit damage (unmodified) at level 80  The Pimp does 1.6 million or 37.7% more damage than the Lyuda, Shot for shot.  I am going to say that unless you are fighting Tera, DPS calculations using the full fire rate of the lyuda and assuming crits is wishful thinking.  Also note the character synergys: Zero can get up to 5 CA stacks from one shot of the Pimp (2 more than the lyuda), both Maya and Zero (I guess Gaige could count here too, but not many people use the pimp on her at the point in the game i did the math for), when Chain Reaction and Bore, respectively, proc the orb throw each time, providing essentially free damage. Also, the Pimp is a lot more ammo efficient, which matters when you are playing normally.  Note that I'm not saying the Lyuda is bad, just that the Pimp is significantly better."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,wingsday1,0,Wed Jul 15 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"Yes but when you take into account fire rate (6.4 Lyuda raised to more than 10 with skills and relics vs 1.3 Pimp) things change drastically. Plus the pellet damage for Pimp is questionable, mostly works in closed spaces and/or close enough. At far distances it makes more sense to compare main damage only. As Zero I kill most of the enemies when they are far from me."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,transframer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"Just some corrections: the base fire rate on the pimp is actually 1.4 (without fire rate accessory) and the fire rate for the Lyuda is only 6.4 if you use the fire rate accessory (which, if you're min/maxing, you shouldn't) otherwise it is 5.7.  The pellet damage for the pimp is actually really reliable, all you have to do is aim a bit below the crit location, it takes some practice, but once you get it down the pimp becomes a beast of a weapon. Also of note, the distance between the crit and sweet spot is the same at all ranges, so you can use the pimp how ever you really want to.  So...the thing about fire rate is that the Pimp can oneshot a lot of basic mobs in uvhm if you use it right, most of the rest will die in 2. On the other hand, in what universe would you want that much fire rate on a sniper? ignoring magsize/reload speed, that would drain your entire pool in ~13 seconds. Concidering that most players play without infinite ammunition, that point was more of a red herring than anything else."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,wingsday1,-1,Wed Jul 15 21:59:13 2015 UTC,"You don't have to use the whole magazine in one pull. Lyuda has a 22 bullets magazine vs 6 for Pimp. That means if I shot 3 bullets per trigger I'm ahead of pimp and I can pull 7 times until I have to reload vs 6 times for pimp. But if I have to shoot continuously I just do it.  A full DPS calculation takes this into account too. But, I agree that if ammo is sparse, Pimp is a better choice"
Borderlands2,3dbc63,transframer,2,Wed Jul 15 23:50:51 2015 UTC,"Lyuda is higher overall DPS. Pimpernel is higher damage per shot (and a better slag weapon/better on ammo consumption).  But yeah semantics, still doesn't change the reasoning behind velocity choices."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,_darkwingduck_,2,Wed Jul 15 23:42:37 2015 UTC,I rarely notice the difference this skill has on most weapons unless i have 11/5 on the skill with a class mod.
Borderlands2,3dbc63,orangemofo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Mainly it affecting the pimpernel. I use a legenedary killer class mod mainly, so I put one point into the it gets boosted up to 6. At the that amount the pimpernel is still usable, and after practice you can use it effectively, but at 11/5 it is impossible to use it right. If you aren't using the pimpernel, and are just beehawking, then 10/5 is a good amount, however I mainly use the pimpernel so I only put one point in it."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,dunks6666,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:49:01 2015 UTC,"Velocity also affects the range at which bullets split into more bullets ( Lyuda, Bekah, Godfinger, etc). More points = greater range. This could be good or bad. I'm so used to what the 0 velocity sweet spot is for Pimps, that I never put points in it now."
Borderlands2,3dbc63,Warhawg01,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:24:55 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of other people have said, it's because it makes the pimp harder(or with a lot of points, impossible) to use, it makes the Lyuda split further away, and actually makes the twister do less damage overall.  There are others, but those are the most important"

Borderlands2,3d9f80,Noirgheos,6,Tue Jul 14 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"I'd probably do something like this. You want to avoid Vel0city, as it makes the Bekah less useful up close. B0re is a skill that you should have on almost every build and it works even better with the Bekah's extra projectiles. Most of the right tree doesn't benefit the Bekah at all, so I'd avoid it except for Grim and F0ll0wthr0ugh, which are fantastic for staying alive, and Excecute for utility.  Your gear looks alright. The Florentine is decent for slagging, although I'd prefer a Slagga or Pimpernel. The Swordsplosion and Harold are fantastic support weapons for the Bekah, as they are better at close range. The Hunter Class Mod is good, but a Legendary Killer Class Mod is much better. I'd prefer a Bone of the Ancients relic or a Cooldown relic to the Blood of the Seraphs, but the health regen is nice. I'd really suggest getting a better grenade though. Slag transfusion or slag O-Negative for healing and the Quasar, slag singularity, and stormfront for utility."

Borderlands2,3d5k6q,ABjerre,5,Mon Jul 13 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Iirc, the dude lost some sponsorship(s) because of it.  Edit: See http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/3135oa/someone_posted_this_on_rgifs/cpyfhy4:   Yea the show is called arrow affliction, he got in alot of trouble for this and lost alot of sponsors including his bow sponsor. His show almost cancelled."
Borderlands2,3d5k6q,RetroEvolute,2,Mon Jul 13 22:38:27 2015 UTC,I wonder why. He was doing the humane thing by trying to kill it as quickly as possible. You can see that its already got an arrow in it but it's still running around. He does what he can to put it out of its misery.
Borderlands2,3d5k6q,D14BL0,2,Tue Jul 14 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"That's actually a pretty good point. I don't hunt, but from the archers I've talked to that do, they often carry a handgun in case of situations like this, or for when an animal charges or attacks them. If the guy didn't have anything like that, then I can kind of see the throwing of the bow. However, I can also get why a bow sponsor (who provided the bow) would get upset seeing that...  Also, for anyone who's not into archery wondering why he didn't just put another arrow in it, generally compounds aren't very good for reactionary shooting."

Borderlands2,3d90t4,Stealth_Commando,4,Tue Jul 14 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"Salvador, middle skill tree all the way. Get a cool down relic and a good class mod and you'll be gunzerking 100% of the time.   Axton is drastically different depending on what skill tree you go down. If you're playing solo, far right skill tree gives your turrets shields and eventually let's you deploy two at once. But no matter what tree you choose, you'll have a really good, balanced character.  For Maya, I would suggest going down the far left tree until you get the perk where your phaselock sucks enemies in (I believe its called converge). After that, go down the far right tree. Coupled with a good elemental SMG, it makes for a really fun play style.   As for Krieg, I haven't played him much but Mania (middle tree) was pretty fun.  Have fun :)"
Borderlands2,3d90t4,Neifers,3,Tue Jul 14 16:47:34 2015 UTC,Thanks :) .
Borderlands2,3d90t4,SilentDis,2,Tue Jul 14 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"I play OP8 Sandhawk Siren, fully geared.  Normally, I go with a Bee shield, but when I'm out solo, I go with the Antagonist.  Relic is a +39% to whichever elemental I'm slinging, usually fire or electricity, Sandhawk to match, with a cooldown modifier.  I tend to run the Cat class mod, with the +138% to SMG damage.  My build is designed to cause maximum elemental and collateral damage with the SMG.  I want my bullets, phaselock, and elementals hitting everything all at once.  I'll often toss a Magic Missle out to slag everything, phaselock one enemy, and do body shots till he's dead.  Most everything else that gets sucked into my phaselock is at half or quarter health, so it's easy to pick the rest of them off.  Here's my current buildout.  In the calculator.  Everything is toward higher and higher damage, and healing utility in group.  I'm all around, and one of the higher DPS people most times on bossfights.  My burst is horrible, but I will lay down fire on everything in the area, instantly.  It's rather fun to open up with a phaselock, fire sandhawk, drop the enemy I locked, and notice the other 4 that were pulled in are slagged, on fire, missing their whole shield and are at half health.  Hope that helps!"
Borderlands2,3d90t4,bigfoot191,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"The most fun build for Krieg, in my opinion, is to go down you middle tree. Krieg can be a little tough to play with until you hit the middle Cap. Then you become a rage monster. After that, I would focus on his left skill tree. Bloodsplosion can be tricky to get the hang of, but when you do, holy crap is it amazing.  Krieg is by far my favourite vault hunter. He is a mass of rage, muscle and explosions, and there is never a dull moment with him.  For Maya, she is a very good healer. I haven't played her much, so I can't comment on fun builds.  I have not even touched Salvador. At all. So I have no insight on him at all.  Axton is an interesting one. If you are interested in dealing tons of explosive damage, he has some skills that boost them. If you want the turret to become more dangerous, than there are skills that do that. It really depends on how they play."

Ruby is a decent alternative for slag & life leech (but isn't guaranteed to roll slag). Magic missles from the Tina DLC are amazing for slag (100% slag chance, big AoE, replenishes itself over time), and you can get those in TVHM since level won't matter."

If you change from TVHM to UVHM you won't have the quest and thus no grognozzle. If you change back to TVHM it comes back to your inventory. To get it in UVHM you have to accept the quest in UVHM, but if you do it will stay in your inventory forever (or until you complete the quest, reset the story mode or change difficulty)."

Borderlands2,3d7nrm,45sfCA,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"I just started playing this game again a few days ago and hit UVHM on my gunzerker.  I've been absolutely creaming enemies.  Killing bosses in a few hits.  It's definitely your equipment.  Go to TVHM and get the Rubi from the Mordecai quest to follow the van and loot barrels of alcohol.  Rakkaholics Anonymous.  Mine was a slag pistol so hopefully you get that element.  You can close the game without saving to try for another element if you don't get one.   Next go to normal mode and farm torgue tokens, you'll need just over six hundred.  The best way is the Bar Brawl 3 quest.  Takes about one minute and gets you 25.  Once you have all the tokens, go back to the Torgue DLC in TVHM and head to one of the Torgue vending machines.  Reload the game until the item of the day is a legendary pistol called Unkempt Harold.  You want the Double Penetrating variant.    Once you have both of these, spec your character for the gunlust and rampage trees.  Try 5 Locked and Loaded, 5 I'm Your Huckleberry, 5 Money Shot, 1 Down Not Out, 3 Divergent Likeness, 5 Inconceivable, 5 All in the Reflexes, 4 Yippie Ki Yay, 1 Double Your Fun, 5 Get Some, and 1 Keep Firing.   Gunzerk all the time using those two pistols. Slag first then use the Harold, which will do hundreds of thousands of damage per hit.  I use a two gun relic right now, a purple one that I got using a gold key.  I'm level 54 and still kicking ass."

Great exp and you want those tokens anyway.  Then continue to do petes bar repeatable quest or boss farm (warrior, bunker, DLC bosses). Petes bar is way better for exp but bosses are better for loot. If you only care about leveling  fast, do the pete bar to 613 tokens then play the first mission over and over (start story mode, play first mission that ends with turning on the mission board, reset, repeat), go into TVHM and pop some golden keys if your gear starts to be a problem as you level.

We haven't got all the DLC, we still need to actually get the one that increased the level cap to 72. Does playing at that level increase the difficulty and quality of loot? Is it just one boss fight that does this or is it the whole game gets harder?"
Borderlands2,3d883t,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"Once you have the UVHM 2 (UVHM in itself is much harder than the other playthroughs) upgrade pack the level cap increases to 72 (which will make the game harder naturally) and opens up OP levels, which you can max at 8 by beating digistruct peak.  Essentially what it does is levels your enemies to 80+ while leaving you at 72, though you can get OP levelled weapons. It applies to all enemies in the game and increases the difficulty substantially."
Borderlands2,3d883t,EC-10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"You need to get the level cap increase. First of all, uvhm (which you should have already) is harder and a lot of fun. Once you get to 72 you can start doing digistruct peak for OP levels. This is a gauntlet that changes every time and gets progressively harder and longer. You must complete it on OP0 to unlock OP1 then OP1 to unlock OP2 all the way to OP8. It is a fun challenge and if you die you fail the gauntlet and must restart. OP8 you end up fighting 17 or so bosses by the end."

The damage bonus is ridiculous, but it can be so annoying as I always seem to hit myself at the most inopportune moments.  Edit: I've done some testing with it and while I can definitely tell a difference, it's a little inconsistent. I do think I'm gonna roll with it for the damage and added fun factor. Thanks for the help and the very detailed explanation!"

Borderlands2,3d37ax,hobowithabazooka,2,Mon Jul 13 07:25:08 2015 UTC,"Silence the voices can be a nuisance but I get around it.  I'll post my build in a bit. With 11 points in it,  your melee hits like a truck and after that kill you can 1 or 2 shot super bad***es with a thrown. I haven't played op8 yet but I don't have much trouble with hitting myself at all."
Borderlands2,3d37ax,MajSigmaE,2,Mon Jul 13 19:00:22 2015 UTC,Okay I have a full guide of my ideas here along with what items work best and such. http://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/537402115072480255/   but my current build (only 58) is http://bl2skills.com/psycho.html#50500515040150500105155100000000000 and it is going amazingly. I don't use anything to extend rampage because it has 0 cooldown with release the beast and longer rage means less times I could heal if I get in a tough spot. (this really helps when bosses don't have adds like with the final boss of torgues dlc)    I have a com that puts silence the voices at 550% melee which is amazing. When I kill enemies with melee attacks it mega boosts my thrown bombadier axe so I can kill one with a single melee attack  and then use the thrown axe to dispatch larger and presumably tougher enemies.  This way you dont put yourself at risk of constantly hitting yourself.    I also have one point in thrill of the kill because... free full heal when not in rampage and I get a kill.  Strip the flesh is there to increase both bloodsplosion and throwing axe.   Can't recall the last boss/enemy that brought me trouble.

Borderlands2,3d38wn,ProfessorPorch,3,Mon Jul 13 05:01:36 2015 UTC,"In normal mode, the Scarlett and Torgue DLC start at level 15 and can go up to level 30. Hammerlock's and Tina's start at 30 and go up to 35.  But, since you beat the game on normal already, you can play the DLC's on TVHM mode so they'll be more level appropriate."

Borderlands2,3d1ax6,dunks6666,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:43:51 2015 UTC,"Helios is good when combined with ruin, since you get all the elements when ever you phaselock. Blight Phoenix is pretty useful, and you can only really test them by.. Well using them in combat"
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,likwidstylez,2,Sun Jul 12 21:38:02 2015 UTC,Both those skills are trash to be honest. Helios is only useful in NVHM and BP is practically useless by the time you have the pre-reqs to get it.
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,branden3710,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:08:24 2015 UTC,"Blight Phoenix applies that stagger ministun that you get sometimes when sniping on most enemies with each pulse so it can act as a decent one point wonder.   Helios is a preference thing as it, flicker, and Immolate all compete as ""those skills that you have to take at least 2 to get to capstone while not really effecting the game in any way"". I like it because it's flashy and take it where I know I'll be able to get more use out of it. If Flicker's math wasn't so shitty it wouldn't be so hard to choose though.  CK is 100% useless though. Doing like 20 damage a tick at level 20+ is just gross to be in the game in the first place"
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,dunks6666,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"Helios is very good in all difficultys IMO, I use it well at OP8"
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,vSmash__,4,Sun Jul 12 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"No, you don't. It's not having any noticeable effect, even if you have 11 points in it.  The damage formula is 1.6×R×1.13L, R being the amount of points in Helios and L being your level. At OP8 with 11/5 points, this comes to 116,724 damage.  That's literally useless at OP8, and the DoT is at level 72 and won't do anything either."
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,MrRafikki,2,Sun Jul 12 23:59:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for that break down
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,LeetheLoopyLobster,2,Mon Jul 13 03:15:25 2015 UTC,So coming from the opinions here I've been taking entirely wrong points as well. What are good ones to invest as a first time Siren player?
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,vSmash__,2,Mon Jul 13 03:29:49 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, Helios is good up to about level 50. In UVHM though, Damage over Time becomes basically useless, and at OP8 Helios doesn't keep increasing damage because you're still technically level 72.  Here's my Maya build, it's specced for Legendary Cat, Breakneck Banshee, and Blurred Trickster builds.  As for low level play, you can honestly use any tree successfully. All down to your playstyle."
Borderlands2,3d1ax6,DenouncedLord,2,Mon Jul 13 03:56:21 2015 UTC,why no ruin? I would have thought that would be a necessity.

Borderlands2,3d11tu,Level69Troll,9,Sun Jul 12 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"Taking a guess here since I'm not 100% clear on health gate mechanics either, but that could mean there are enemies with attacks that will do massive damage, no matter your shield/health combo, and so if you're above 50%, the attack will always trigger the health gate. I believe one such enemy is Terramorphous, but correct me if I'm wrong."
Borderlands2,3d11tu,Halfslats,8,Sun Jul 12 17:23:42 2015 UTC,"This.  You are right about how it works.  In fact most enemies do ""health gate"" style dmg.  Its purpose was designed to let the player get out of a tight spot in the presence of a badass or boss.  I think the only dmg yhat does ""true dmg"" is elemental.  So, turrets, novas, barrels, etc.    EDIT: So, the only thing that ignores the health gate is environmental damage and Elemental DoTs instead of all elemental dmg.  I got that a bit wrong initially."
Borderlands2,3d11tu,bman166,3,Sun Jul 12 17:48:10 2015 UTC,So basically health gating means that attacks are capped at a max 50% of your health in damage and can't go above that?
Borderlands2,3d11tu,zegg,8,Sun Jul 12 20:26:01 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Health gating is in the game to help prevent you from being instantly oneshotted when you have a good amount (read percentage) of health. This is done in-game by making any attack that would deal fatal damage while you have more that half your health reduce your health to a critically low amount, instead of killing you. For example, say you have 75/100 health and you are hit by an attack for 1000 damage. Without healthgating this attack would easily kill you, dealing 10 times your maximum health! But, because of health gating, since your health is above 50% of your total health, you would survive with something like 1-5 health (guessing here)."
Borderlands2,3d11tu,FalloutFanatic,2,Sun Jul 12 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, sweet. That's pretty handy."
Borderlands2,3d11tu,Halfslats,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:01:36 2015 UTC,So health gate does not protect against nova or any elemental effects? Is this why people hate Hyperious with he Nova attack?
Borderlands2,3d11tu,Codered218,2,Mon Jul 13 05:01:57 2015 UTC,"No, the only things that ignore healthgate is environmental damage (barrels) and player damage (dueling)"
Borderlands2,3d11tu,bman166,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, All novas dont Ignore the health gate, but Hyperious' nova does.  And Voracidous.  Turrets dont ignore, but they do damage in such rapid incraments with such a high chance to DoT (which, besides environment dmg, is the only other thing that does ignore health gate) that I thought they did."
Borderlands2,3d11tu,Ralonne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:30:24 2015 UTC,"Novas (i.e. enemy damage) follow the same rules for health-gating. Hyperius's novas cannot one-shot you, nor can Vorac's novas one-shot you, if you are above 50% health.  DoTs are different in that they have ticks. DoT from Healianth, Brood, Incinerator, Vorac, Pete and Terra can ""one-shot"" you (quotes, because it's not actually one-shotting you. Just ticking down damage very fast + initial hit).  Hyp's and Vorac's novas are considered non-elemental, and do not have a DoT affect."
Borderlands2,3d11tu,bman166,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:29:21 2015 UTC,"See, I wasnt ever sure about those raid novas.  And the DoTs i was just going off of what the Borderlands Wiki stated."

Borderlands2,3d11tu,bman166,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:33:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip about the wiki.  I usually just use it for loot locations, as it hasnt turned me wrong there."
Borderlands2,3d11tu,branden3710,5,Sat Jul 18 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"If a character has at least two health points more than 50% of maximum health, he/she cannot be crippled by a single enemy attack; instead, the character's health will be reduced to an extremely low value. This mechanic is known as health gating and is intended to give the player a chance to recover or escape in the face of extremely powerful enemies. The health gate does not protect against damage-over-time effects or environmental damage such from exploding barrels.   In UVHM and OP levels you will easily get health gated as enemy damage scales much more steeply than your health. By OP8 you'll pretty much be healthgated by almost anything as the base damage of enemy attacks  is easily much larger than even your maximum health.  This just forces you to play more conservatively in the end game and use cheesy strategie to kill enemies before they get to kill you."
Borderlands2,3d0dyh,Noirgheos,14,Sun Jul 12 13:03:03 2015 UTC,"Innervate is VERY worth it. Although I am using a melee build. The damage is only on the first shot but works well with snipers. The real star of it is the speed and health regen, if your under healthgate and you have 5 points in it you can usually get above it and have speed to dodge things as well. This is coming from a 72 zero with plenty of points though, if your not max rank yet I'd wait unless you want kunai, if you do it's worth it."

Borderlands2,3d0dyh,ImXolum,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"I quite like it. My main Zer0 is built around getting tons of utility out of decepti0n, and innervate is one of my most useful utilities from it.  My class mod gives me an extra 2 in it, so I regen a reasonable bit of health, move very quick, and hit hard. All three are useful, but fr different scenarios. When Decepti0n is acting as an ""oh shit"" button, the mobility and health bump are handy. If I'm on the offensive, that extra damage, coupled with the kunai, death mark, and magic missiles I threw right before, mean that one shot hits HARD."

Borderlands2,3d0hml,Juan_martini,3,Sun Jul 12 19:02:28 2015 UTC,Xbox 360 appreciate the offer thou thank you
Borderlands2,3d247k,SKreapergaming,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:22:06 2015 UTC,Well I usually dont start them until level 28-30 so I could use that gear in TVHM for a while
Borderlands2,3d1t9c,Blight254,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:53:36 2015 UTC,Ive completed all the DLC's except the Mr Torgue DLC and they are definitely worth it but the post in the side bar is much more helpful than anything I could tell you.
Borderlands2,3d1t9c,BasicallySheriff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:22:34 2015 UTC,All the dlc in the game is pretty fun I would recommend picking them up
Borderlands2,3d1t9c,TheGamingHermit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"Tiny Tina's dlc is amazing, Scarlett's dlc gives you good guns."
Borderlands2,3d1i9s,Copykatninja,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:23:53 2015 UTC,What characters do you have?
Borderlands2,3cyzit,kahrido,11,Sun Jul 12 01:41:42 2015 UTC,Go down the Motion and Cataclysm trees if you want to go on the offensive.
Borderlands2,3cyzit,clown613,9,Sun Jul 12 02:37:51 2015 UTC,Mmm that bouncing Cataclysmic bubble of doom has got to be one of the most devasting skills in the game when dealing with groups.
Borderlands2,3cyzit,DragonsAreReal96,2,Sun Jul 12 07:08:55 2015 UTC,Sh... She gets that strong?
Borderlands2,3cyzit,DragonsAreReal96,4,Sun Jul 12 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"Well it depends. Do you have any expansions? With an increased level cap, the bouncing bubble of doom is possible. Still, Motion+Cataclysm is disgusting when it comes to DPS, especially if you focus on elemental damage which is what you should be doing on Maya.  Edit: Basically, go down Cataclysm first and get all the elemental stuff and Ruin. Then, get Converge and Sub-sequence in Motion. The remaining points can be distributed however you want. I like getting the healing in Harmony but you could also get Thoughtlock and have your elemental exploding enemy chase after other foes."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,X_POiiSON_X,3,Sun Jul 12 16:00:17 2015 UTC,The handsome collection comes with all of the dlcs.
Borderlands2,3cyzit,IrisRisen,7,Sun Jul 12 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"focus on your Phaselock tree, then try to get some points into health boosting. Also, Cat Maya (focusing on SMG use) is waaaayyyyy overpowered."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,IrisRisen,2,Sun Jul 12 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"Is it just the weapons I got, or do all SMGS have a huge scope?"
Borderlands2,3cyzit,azothshock,3,Sun Jul 12 03:51:31 2015 UTC,"depends on the manufacturing. Tediore, Bandit, and Torgue scopes generally are more restrictive on the sights since they magnify more, whereas the others don't magnify as much, and as such, gives you bigger fields of view."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,Vulchur,7,Sun Jul 12 04:10:30 2015 UTC,Go for motion first and a few points in the healing tree if playing solo
Borderlands2,3cyzit,Seytai,2,Sun Jul 12 03:31:51 2015 UTC,"I have a group of friends I play with, but I still don't want to be support haha."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,Raxvar,6,Sun Jul 12 03:50:56 2015 UTC,Just a few points in the middle tree not for playing with other people but because even solo it helps a lot with her survivability.
Borderlands2,3cyzit,branden3710,3,Sun Jul 12 04:08:56 2015 UTC,"At the very least get sweet release. When you kill a phaselocked enemy, health orbs will spawn from the enemy seeking and healing you and your friends. It's a fine thing to have and you'll be helping your friends just by using and killing will your ability."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,branden3710,3,Sun Jul 12 14:57:22 2015 UTC,"http://bl2skills.com/siren.html#055001000005050000005550500501  Something along thse lines.. There's points left over to put wherever, and some things can be shuffled. The important core bits are Chain Reaction, Reaper, Ruin, Converge, and Wreck. Even in a totally non-support build Sweet Release is absolutely worth taking, refills a lot of HP for doing something you're going to be doing constantly anyways.  Also, skill resetting/respeccing is cheap so don't be afraid to try stuff out."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,viaminorviator,3,Sun Jul 12 06:49:57 2015 UTC,"One thing that is super super important to note: in the Cataclysm tree, directly damaging skills like Helios or Cloud Kill or Blight Phoenix are cool in the early game or first playthough in NVHM, but later they lose effectiveness very quickly at higher levels. You can take them if you want but you need to re-spec them out as soon as you feel them falling off, as they'll be completely useless soon after that.  I/e this could work in NVHM, but by the time you get to sanctuary in TVHM you'll want something more like this"
Borderlands2,3cyzit,Anenome5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:13:20 2015 UTC,"I know about Cloud Kill, and Blight Phoenix not scaling well, but Helios actually looks strong. Is spending points in Helios worth it?"
Borderlands2,3cyzit,AustereSpoon,2,Sun Jul 12 22:01:10 2015 UTC,"Later its damage isn't very huge at all, but it isn't completely unusable as the others are.   In the long run as it is a preference thing as it, flicker, and Immolate all compete as ""those skills that you have to take at least 2 to get to capstone while not really affecting the game in any major way"". If you don't die then Immolate is effectively useless, and the math behind flicker makes it pretty bad also, so up to you.   I run it over flicker in mobbing runs like the Bloodshot Stronghold or Southpaw, or over Immolate if I know I will not die.   As long as you aren't running Backdraft or Cloud kill or more than 1 point in Blight Phoenix you can't go too horribly wrong with the tree as even the skills you do take aren't very great in order to balance that capstone  I probably should have mentioned this initially but I wasn't sure what to expect from a ""first time playing borderlands"" post"
Borderlands2,3cyzit,eghhge,2,Sun Jul 12 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"I play Maya as my primary character and her support skills are invaluable as you get into more difficult situations. The two that I use for support most of the time are being able to shoot someone to heal them and phase lock to revive them.  Between Motion and Cataclysm, she packs a pretty powerful punch. You'll find yourself re-specing based on the situation though. You wouldn't use the same skills for fighting a raid boss as you would for plowing through mobs.  My favorite thing to do is walk into mobs, phaselock with the skill that sucks everyone towards the orb, then kill the phase locked dude and have the orb move onto lock up the next schmuck.  I have a Gaige and Zero, and they're okay, but Maya and I are tight, yo.  I have problems."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,spases,2,Sun Jul 12 07:07:14 2015 UTC,Get some elemental weapons and rock out.
Borderlands2,3cyzit,eghhge,2,Sun Jul 12 07:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, today I picked up some fire, electric, and explosive weapons. Doing a ton of damage."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,eghhge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"I know I am a bit late to the party, and I am not sure where you are in the story, but you will regret not having a corrosive weapon of some kind by the time you are Rescuing Roland from the Bloodshots."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,nakedapedude,5,Tue Jul 14 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"Bee plus Sandhawk, get one in each element, but shock is best overall; Maya is a beast, first character of mine to get to op8."
Borderlands2,3cyzit,Level69Troll,5,Sun Jul 12 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"As I said, I'm new to the game. What is op8?"
Borderlands2,3czom7,CynicalNord,3,Sun Jul 12 06:15:57 2015 UTC,God damn xbox XD it's great these kind of people exist on this sub.
Borderlands2,3czom7,PenguinsRuleOverUs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:49:30 2015 UTC,TazMast388 thanks for the great loot
Borderlands2,3czom7,Tazmast388,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:39:53 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'll be on around 11AM EST, if that's alright?"
Borderlands2,3czom7,Tazmast388,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"Did you get them when I dropped the stuff for you? I'm not sure if you were saying anything, my tv was on mute."
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,grahamsera,7,Sat Jul 11 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"Nope. Me and a friend actually froze the game doing this while playing on PS3. We got drunk from the Grog Nozzle and shot the Mongol into the sky in the mines of avarice and the game just couldn't handle it. We were both happy and disappointed that it didn't freeze on PS4. Also, to contribute to ideas, the nukem looks badass when drunk.  Remember, drink responsibly when operating firearms on Pandora. Or just get drunk and shoot the coolest gun you can find into the sky."
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,FalloutFanatic,2,Sat Jul 11 20:51:41 2015 UTC,That is because ps3 could not handle it not the game.
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,oi-__-io,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:55:30 2015 UTC,"You're right, that's what I meant. Sorry, I just worded that poorly."
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,FalloutFanatic,3,Sat Jul 11 22:05:18 2015 UTC,Drunken Norfleet. Beautiful and deadly.
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,suprluigibro,2,Sun Jul 12 04:44:47 2015 UTC,"Drunken Hive.  Awesome looking and deadly as fuck.  Makes armored enemies into bitches, no matter the difficulty."
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:19:39 2015 UTC,The unkempt Harold for sure
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,jascha314,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"Try a drunken sawbar sometime, the projectiles already explode like fireworks. When drunk off the grog there's literally a wall of fire in front of you."
Borderlands2,3cy1yz,MyOtherTagsGood,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:20:56 2015 UTC,Sandhawk+grog nozzle+burst fire=birds for days
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,Athanaetos,3,Sat Jul 11 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"You should get the bee shield and a few legendary weapons that are good for your class (try to get a slagged version of it, they're much more useful in uhvm).   Other than that, you shouldn't really stick in tvhm to farm because all of your gear will be obsolete once you're a few levels in."
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,Chicken_McFaggots,2,Sat Jul 11 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"Ok that's a good idea, I'll try to farm The Bee, any tips?  Edit: Got The Bee, anything else?"
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,ProfessorPorch,3,Sat Jul 11 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"In UVHM you're going to need a good way to slag enemies. They recover heal instant after taking damage. Farming isn't really going to help, your gear will be useless after you lever a few time. Def not worth the time you'll be putting into get some gear. Who are you playing as?"
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,ProfessorPorch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"So I should just continue to UVHM and do the side quest there? What about DLC, when should I do that? I am playing as Axton."
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,gooserooster88,2,Sat Jul 11 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, if you don't have a problem killing anything. Spec your sentry gun for that slag affect."
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,gooserooster88,2,Sat Jul 11 21:47:17 2015 UTC,I would try and get yourself a Slagga. I used my level 50 one all the way up until level 72. I also used a bunch of golden keys to help me as I leveled up.
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,Warhawg01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:56:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, I got a Slagga - you're saying it should be good to lvl 72? or do I have to keep getting it? Is there anything else?"
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,FalloutFanatic,2,Sat Jul 11 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"The level 50 version should be fine, all you need it to do is slag an enemy as fast as possible. Put points in the weapon swap speed skill too. When you get to the BNK3R you may want to try and farm a Sham, but be careful you don't over level yourself too much."
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,nakedapedude,2,Sun Jul 12 00:08:49 2015 UTC,"Also note that you can reset UVHM. It keeps all your gear/skills but starts you over at Liar's Berg. So you can do a side quest to get some quest reward and then reset the game and do it again. Be advised this resets the entire game, including DLC."
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,jazzsam,2,Sat Jul 11 23:24:29 2015 UTC,"I would do what a lot of people here said. Get a slagga and maybe a good shield as a bee-backup in case you're in an area that doesn't favor it. I would farm an Unkempt Harold if it doesn't overlevel you too much. Some weapons are truly legendary and are great for a good number of levels into the future. The Harold is one of those weapons. You could try Torgues DLC if you have some progress in, otherwise I would give Savage Lee a go.  Good luck in UVHM!"
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,nakedapedude,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:59:08 2015 UTC,"Edit: It seems I have run into a different problem now and I am unsure if I should create a new thread. When I finished the second play through I was around lvl 48 in TVHM. I then continued to get some legendary as many of you have suggested and eventually got to lvl 50, now I am playing UVHM and for some reason I am not lvling beyond 50. There is not even a little bit of experience bar filled up. Any help on how to fix this?"
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,jazzsam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"You need the Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack  DLCs, the first one increases the level cap to 61, the second one increases it to 72."
Borderlands2,3cxvl1,xGr1m,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:53:24 2015 UTC,"Curious, is that DLC included in the HJC version?"
Borderlands2,3cuary,RuleTheAbyss,25,Fri Jul 10 20:57:13 2015 UTC,I hope somebody got him some good pretzels.

Borderlands2,3cwo6j,Noirgheos,7,Sat Jul 11 12:32:15 2015 UTC,Bekah for massive damage. Excellent in the Peak/Excellent in UVHM.  Kitten for elemental damage. Okay in the Peak/Excellent in UVHM.
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,lftmm,2,Sat Jul 11 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, was farming and I found a Boss Bekah."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,lftmm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:55:50 2015 UTC,Excellent.
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,lftmm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:13:25 2015 UTC,Now that I check it it's also a Dahl stock.... hmmm.
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,lftmm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"Once again, excellent. Nice find."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,lftmm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"I was doing some testing, and it seems as if the Hammer Buster still does more damage. Against Big Bertha the Bekah does 332K to 480K. The Hammer Buster goes all the way to 678K."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,8988303682,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:51:10 2015 UTC,"You can't be using the Bekah correctly. It is the strongest AR in the game.  The 332K - 480K, are they seperate damage numbers?"
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,grahamsera,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:11:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But those are body shots. Along with my double shot perk, and the cirtical hit damage perk I do around 1500K damage per shot."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,StiffCrustySock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  The Bekah shoots MULTIPLE projectiles, each damage number you are seeing from a single shot equals to being more damage when added up than the Hammer Buster."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,HanzsKlopek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"Dahl stock is the best, especially for Jakob's."

Borderlands2,3cwo6j,cellfreezer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:27:59 2015 UTC,The only assault rifle I ever really liked in Borderlands 2 was the Slag Kitten. That weapon is bad ass ... other than that I never use assault rifle.
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,ScootaLewis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:54:32 2015 UTC,You should see a fire Kitten on a Hellborn Krieg.  It's raid-worthy.
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,hobowithabazooka,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:09:01 2015 UTC,You don't need an AR. You never need an AR. ARs suck.  What you want doesn't exist.
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,8988303682,8,Sat Jul 11 12:56:08 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to this guy. Get the Bekah if you want a good assault rifle. I don't think there's one that is two elemental like the Florentine though. Besides, the Florentine isn't really that good."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,Slyzavh,2,Sat Jul 11 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"The florentine is fine for regular play - it's at higher levels like UVHM and OP levels that it falls off.  I will admit that the bekah is good, but it's a major exception."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,8988303682,3,Sat Jul 11 15:13:53 2015 UTC,Florentine is still great in late uvhm and op levels. Amazing shield stripper and deals solid damage. I always have one in my hellborn kriegs inventory
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,Slyzavh,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:34:01 2015 UTC,The Florentine is not a good weapon. You can get more damage out of a normal Plasma Caster or any decent SMG.
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,8988303682,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"OP8 Siren here, Florentine is second most used weapon next to the Sandhawk, it kicks major ass."

Borderlands2,3cwo6j,8988303682,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:33:48 2015 UTC,Easier to get? You buy it with searaph crystals. Doesn't get much easier than that. And what other weapons do you suggest? Other than the obvious Sandhawk.    Edit: Typo
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,brandpanz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"That depends on what youre looking for, the florentine is a utility weapon, which Maya has absolutly no need for, so I can't exactly give you related examples. Also, not all players have easy access to seraph crystals"
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,8988303682,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:47:42 2015 UTC,"It's a good utility weapon. However, in the case of Maya, with whom you're most likely to use SMGs, it's not really needed since you're probably using Ruin and/or Scorn already."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,brandpanz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:07:55 2015 UTC,"If by ""utility weapon"" you mean ""slagging weapon"", then no, it is not a good utility weapon. A slag Pimpernel, a Grog, or even a Slagga would be a much better option."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,brandpanz,5,Sat Jul 11 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Slagga, Pimp and Grog don't strip shields. Conversely, Storm Front, Chain Lightning etc. don't slag. Florentine does both.  Florentine's like a jack of all trades utility gun: it can do a lot, but it's not the best in any of its functions."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,cellfreezer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"You don't need shock weapons at op8 (the only one I would recommend is the Twister). My usual Sniper Zer0 gear setup is   Fire Pimp Slag Pimp Corrosive Pimp Corrosive/Fire Lyuda (depending on if I'm running through a flesh or armor area)   Grenade: Longbow Slag Transfusion (mainly for health regen, not slag)  COM: Legendary Sniper  Shield: Antagonist  Relic: BoTA in fire or corrosive.  I do much better with this than I do on Maya with the Florentine."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,cellfreezer,2,Sat Jul 11 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"Pimp Zero is the highest DPS build in the game, of course you're not going to need shock for it (heck, you don't even need slag for it provided your CA is high enough). On Maya it's redundant as I said earlier since she's always spamming Phaselock and slagging everyone with Ruin. On a character like Krieg however who has no ways to easily slag or shield strip the Florentine becomes more useful. Shield stripping isn't necessary too often but it can still help a lot."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,wingsday1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"Hail, Sawbar, Kitten, most spiniguns (both red text and non-red text), and all legendaries (heck, even Madhous!) are all ARs that do at least fine at OP8. None of them are as good as the Bekah of course, but they're all definitely doable for most of the game. A lot of people like to complain about ""MUH CRITS!!1"" So what? It's only about a 17% decrease, and every character has ways to compensate for that."
Borderlands2,3cwo6j,vSmash__,0,Sat Jul 11 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"The Hammer Buster does more DPS than the Bekah, and I have an Antagonist for my shield. The Florentine is also taking down enemies faster than any other weapon.  Why the Bekah?"

Borderlands2,3ctwl1,dunks6666,5,Fri Jul 10 22:22:30 2015 UTC,I could see how this would benefit a shotgun zer0 build.
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,sailb0ats,2,Sat Jul 11 05:01:56 2015 UTC,"Good, my knowledge was passed on"
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,dunks6666,4,Sun Jul 12 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"I'm really not a fan of any of the builds on that page. If I were to play a level 50 shotgun Zer0, I'd probably do something like this. Followed by this at level 61 and this at 72 if you have the DLCs that increase your level.  Zer0 can make great use of many different types of guns. Purple rarity quad shotguns (the ones with the Torgue barrel that use 4 ammo per shot) work fantastic, as Zer0 can maneuver around the battlefield to get the perfect shot. Most of the legendary shotguns work great as well. The Striker, Conference Call, Deliverance, and Sledge's Shotgun all are viable with Zer0. Most unique quest reward shotguns work great as well.  It's probably best to take a few weapons that aren't shotguns as well. The Maggie is one of my favorites and still fits into the shotgun theme. In UVHM and especially the OP levels, slag is vital, so a method of slagging is needed. I prefer the Pimpernel from the first campaign DLC, but the Slagga is a good choice, too.    Now on to shields. There are a few that work well. Absorb shields, especially the Sham, work great against enemies with guns. A fantastic general use shield is the Antagonist, again from the first campaign DLC. If you don’t have it, get it. A bunch of the unique items that are added are fantastic. Honestly, there isn’t a shield that is vital to the build, so find one that you like.  Relics: Cooldown Relic and Bone of the Ancients. Shorter cooldown= more Deception = more shots out of Deception = much more damage."
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,CDRE_JMButterfield,3,Fri Jul 10 20:31:17 2015 UTC,Ambush is a better choice than Fearless especially with shotguns: its 20% multiplicative damage will add way more than Fearless's 15% additive since Decepti0n is additive itself.
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,brandpanz,2,Mon Jul 13 01:59:36 2015 UTC,That is completely my bad. I was tired when I made those.
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,CDRE_JMButterfield,3,Mon Jul 13 03:49:29 2015 UTC,Take a point from somewhere and put it in death mark
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,Codered218,2,Fri Jul 10 19:27:49 2015 UTC,what does this mean
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,HumbleHominid,9,Fri Jul 10 19:38:07 2015 UTC,Take a point out of one of your other skills and put it in deathmark..
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,seemtee,3,Fri Jul 10 19:42:36 2015 UTC,He means you should respec and invest enough points to obtain the Deathmark skill(1 point cost). It's a solid skill that adds a 20% debuff to defense. A good skill but for a shotgun class I'd rely on a bore build and the twister shotgun. Or interfacer.
Borderlands2,3ctwl1,Juan_martini,2,Fri Jul 10 19:42:51 2015 UTC,My personal favorite shotgun for zer0 is the Orphan maker

Borderlands2,3cux99,nf5,3,Fri Jul 10 23:52:38 2015 UTC,Have you tried restarting Windows? It's surprising/alarming how many times that cures things.
Borderlands2,3cux99,zark,2,Sat Jul 11 16:21:01 2015 UTC,"I though u means the mission ""Critical Failure"""
Borderlands2,3cux99,Azurvajraca,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:26:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a corrupted save file. I had something similar happen a year or so ago. I had to turn off cloud saving on steam, and manually go back through my past cloud saves and load each to see if was corrupted. I ended up finding a 14 day old file that was playable, loading up that save and turning back on cloud saving to back up that save.   PS: this was awhile ago and can't  remember the exact process I googled most of it, you will also lose progress of how ever many days back you have to go as well"
Borderlands2,3cux99,b0b_402,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"You've done what I would try doing, so I'm not sure. zark said to restart windows and sometimes the simplest thing to do is the proper fix. b0b_402 might also be right. If the save was corrupted and the game didn't know how to identify it, the default character is Axton, so his explanation would make sense and I would give what he said to do a go. If that works and you lose progress or if nothing works, you could use gibbed to build characters back to where they were or remake them. In a wosrt case scenario you might have to delete your saves and profile. It would be a bit of a pain in the butt, but you'd be able to build up your characters to right where they were in terms of BA rank, lvl, gear, and quest/play through.  Anyways, I hope you get your characters back. Losing them to circumstances outside of your control sucks :("
Borderlands2,3cux99,FalloutFanatic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:46:28 2015 UTC,I actually had this same exact issue about a month ago. Whenever it would happen I just reinstalled and restarted windows and it fixed it
Borderlands2,3ctwaw,fnfrank820,2,Fri Jul 10 19:08:36 2015 UTC,"Nice, I had to close out the game twice to get a cc. Always do that if you don't get a legendary you want"
Borderlands2,3ctwaw,snipey826,2,Fri Jul 10 21:03:56 2015 UTC,New to borderlands. How and when does this work?
Borderlands2,3ctwaw,kahrido,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"It really only works on the warrior or handsome sorcerer. When you kill them you check the legendary that they dropped. If it's not the one you want/element you want, just dashboard and reload the game. Only downside is you'll have to kill the boss again. The warrior and handsome sorcerer can drop the impaler shield, flakker shotgun, leech grenade, volcano sniper rifle and the conference call. Or if you're lucky you can get a world drop"
Borderlands2,3ctwaw,snipey826,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:02:43 2015 UTC,Why close the game? Why not just take what it drops and then just quit without leaving the area and come back to kill it again?
Borderlands2,3ctwaw,Wild_Wilbus,2,Tue Jul 14 05:31:20 2015 UTC,Cause when you kill them as a part of the story they have a higher drop rate. It's basically guaranteed a drop. If you take it then turn in the quest and go back and kill them you might not get a legendary drop for a while
Borderlands2,3ctwaw,snipey826,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:33:13 2015 UTC,"Oh good to know, thanks for the info!"

Borderlands2,3cszzq,IKill4MySkill,4,Fri Jul 10 15:08:13 2015 UTC,Get a few TORGUE GUNNNNNNS. That's about it.
Borderlands2,3cszzq,FalloutFanatic,2,Fri Jul 10 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"Don't forget tediore. While I usually don't use them on my other characters except maybe Krieg, all the Axton grenade damage skills and the class mod(s) can make them quite good. At level 72 it gets dumb enough that a build I found can kill Hyperius in under 10 or 15 seconds of combat."
Borderlands2,3cszzq,confusedsquirrel,4,Sun Jul 12 01:14:17 2015 UTC,Run and hide. Shoot and Hide. Try to not get shot yourself.
Borderlands2,3cszzq,GeovaneSilva97,3,Fri Jul 10 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Well, TVHM is very basic in my opinion  Before start it, you should farm some blues/purples from BNK-3R and other bosses, so the beginning will be easier. Also, you should invest in Guerilla tree for max DPS with turret or if you are having trouble invest in Survival, for obvious reasons. Remember to always cover and use explosive weapons, axton skills buff those weapons. You should be fine."
Borderlands2,3cszzq,nakedapedude,2,Fri Jul 10 16:03:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the real fun starts in UVHM which is pretty much a different game from normal and true. I would blast trough the story line, spend golden keys to keep gear up to spec and start UVHM at about level 50."
Borderlands2,3cszzq,raoulduke212,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:45:01 2015 UTC,"TVHM is not that challenging, just make sure you keep your weapons as close to your current level as possible and you should be fine.  Gather many golden keys so you can get gear from the chest in sanctuary.  Or do some of the farming runs that are described on this sub.  But I think the keys are the easiest.  I've played through using Axton in TVHM and UVHM.  Some peeps on here advise saving all of the rare item missions for playthrough 2.5 (which if you don't know is after you beat the warrior in TVHM), so you can use them in UVHM. That didn't work out for me because by the time I started playthrough 2.5 , I was close to level 50, so by the time i got through all the rare item missions I saved for 2.5, i was at around level 54, and all the rare items I had capped at level 50, and therefore pretty much useless by the time you start UVHM.    So in short, if you are planning on trying UVHM, my advice is to play straight through TVHM and try to time it so you are at level 50 or 51 max before beginning UVHM."
Borderlands2,3cszzq,BlLLr0y,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:45:27 2015 UTC,to solve this issue you uninstall the first UVHP so you stay locked at 50 until you want to move on to UVHM.

Borderlands2,3cszzq,HanzsKlopek,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:35:21 2015 UTC,Get to level 50 as fast as possible. This is my advice. Don't bother too much with sidequests and don't loose too much time farming. Once you get to 48 go beat the Warrior. Then you can farm a little for a Bee if you like that shield and head straight into UVHM as soon as you hit level 50. In other words .. don't spend too much time in TVHM because the real challenge begins after that ;)
Borderlands2,3cszzq,dunks6666,-1,Sat Jul 11 14:59:59 2015 UTC,Delete Axton and do it with maya or gaige. That's my advice

I mean, I'm sure the empire didn't chince on equipment, so their guns must've been accurate. The stormtroopers just didn't hit anything.  Maybe if they had guns with richochet a bullet would finally hit something. Failing that, maybe homing darts or the seeker rifle. Or just teach them to shoot like gaige. With close enough, so long as they didn't shoot into the sky, they would have to hit something. You know what, scratch that last Gaige idea. I feel like they would wind up shooting eachother somehow."

It only works with a second controller, but basically you just log in two separate profiles. Whatever player you want the Badass Tokens on needs to start the game. Load yours so that you're at the main menu. Back up to the ""press x to start"" screen and press x on controller two. (They don't need an actual character or anything, just need to load it on there.) Then go back again and press x with player one again and it should give you all of the badass tokens without changing your badass rank. You have to spend all of your badass tokens before you can do it again, but it can compound as many times as you want."

Salvador is the only character that can repeatedly kill raid bosses successfully successively, other characters can kill them but not every time- Cept Axton, he rubbish.  Also scaling broke after the first level increase, and also on op8 damage scales but health doesn't- e.g. Let's say a fire dot scales from 40% to 90% (don't know the actual numbers) but you health stays the same, so on op8 you take way more damage. Enemies also have large damage resistance on op8, and unlike the damage resistance you can apply to yourself, it actually works as damage resisitance"

I know that probably sounds dumb considering the game is Borderlands and everything is silly and a joke.

Borderlands2,3cnv6g,zomigod,10,Thu Jul 9 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"Jack knows you can't die because the respawn machines are Hyperion. Just because you can't die, though, doesn't mean you can beat him.

Borderlands2,3cnv6g,too_oh_ate,13,Thu Jul 9 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"In my head the explanation for this is that jack just enjoyed watching you die again and again. He also needed you to live long enough to deliver the core to sanctuary. He had taken the other four hunters off the system once they had played their part, thats why roland stayed dead.   And when you came to face Jack, he would've taken you off the new-u system, but angel somehow preprogrammed it to take jack off the system instead, that's why he died permanently.  But the explanation that the game is just silly works too."
Borderlands2,3cnv6g,Admiral_Cuntfart,3,Thu Jul 9 16:42:33 2015 UTC,That was always what I thought was the implied reason for Jack acknowledging the New-U stations until Gearbox said the stations were non-canon entirely.

Borderlands2,3cr29z,junglethedwarf,7,Fri Jul 10 02:21:13 2015 UTC,"I used to solo run Axton a lot. My build wasn't gear intensive, but there are some basic things you're gonna need if you go this route. Tactically, you are going to want to identify 1) kill zones on the battle field, 2) your turret's best field of view in relation to the zone, 3) and a fighting position with cover from the zone. You need slag implosion grenades. They will pull the enemies toward the area you are about the rain hell on. Depending on the fuse time you need to choose whether you toss the grenade or you turret first, but that is up to you. I generally toss the grenade into the kill zone, deploy the turret, and then get to my fighting position. If there are a few guys that are on the fringe, or just outside of where I want them, then I'll sometimes just chuck a second one. The damage output is secondary to all things. The most important part is the implosion and the slag.   First things first, you want to maximize the rate you deploy your turret, and how bad ass it is on your way to getting Double Up. You can boost that rate through class mods and a late(r) game push to Resourceful in the Survival tree. But going through the first play through max out Sentry, Laser Sight, Grenadier, and get to rocket turrets as fast as you can.  Beef those turrets up! And then feed the beast with grenades. I skip Ready and Crisis Management altogether. I throw three points each in Willing, Able, and Onslaught to make Double Up available.   Use elemental appropriate weapons that let you fight from medium range. SMGs, ARs, and Pistols all do the trick.  Just keep up to date weapons, and don't get too attached. Spend that E on making sure you have enough ammo. Explosive weapons are a nice catch all, especially with the implosion. But it doesn't really matter too much till you get to higher levels, and then you can farm if you really need something specific. But this build will get you to UVHM in a fun way. Don't over extend you turret. When/if it is no longer useful, recall it and get the boost to your recharge.  Fight from a position, and don't be afraid to use your cover when you are reloading! Use a heavy hitter to clear the weak dudes out, so you can focus on any mini bosses with our implosion created kill box.   I had a lot of fun kinda roleplaying the solider, and fighting tactically. You play it almost like Gears of War, except you have a death slinging turret. Once you get all of Guerrilla filled up, start going down Survival, and nab Resourceful first. At 61 you get two turrets and double the death and slag! At that point you can use any implosion grenade you want, and you'll want to switch one of your weapons to a slag.  I don't know if this helps, but I had a lot of fun with it with I first started. Go get'm, slab!    Edit: Double Turrets is at level 57. Thanks /u/Pessau"
Borderlands2,3cr29z,FunWinterSport,2,Fri Jul 10 08:32:51 2015 UTC,You can get two turrets at level 57. 26 points in both left and right skilltree.

Borderlands2,3cr29z,billpika,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:32:25 2015 UTC,I think that the mechro is a lot of fun for first timing the game as its pretty much axton with a better more mobile turret.

Borderlands2,3cr29z,DekuNut,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"I found turrets to be quite weak weapons, especially against raid-bosses. The best use for them was when could be teleported (longbow) and used as slag source but that come pretty up in the skill tree. Also useful is the skill (Battlefront) that increases your (not turrets) damage when turrets are deployed."
Borderlands2,3cr29z,transframer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether you reroll or stick with Axton, playing with more people is 100% the way to go. More mayhem, better loot, nice being able to have someone res you, etc. Its just overall a lot more fun.  The only downside (some say a massive one) is that while ammo and money are shared by the team, guns/shield/etc are not. So if a boss/chest has a gun, only one of you are getting it. This can lead to...unpleasantness. Especially when playing with random people.  Enjoy!"

He's pretty fun and I enjoy playing with him but I have to admit that since I started playing with Maya I have a lot more fun. Depends on your playstyle I'd say .. but I think Maya is way better for solo ...
Borderlands2,3cr29z,HanzsKlopek,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"Axton is the worst character IMO- try Maya or Gaige, they both have easy to learn play styles, Cept anarchy when you have shirty guns, but they are both very good at levelling and playing the story mode in general"

If you are say, level 41 and the mission difficulty is level 47, you're going to have a bad time. Dlcs and side quests will help you catch up to the mission level difficulty. I have never played the commando so I cannot give any tips there. Good luck though, I'm sure you will really enjoy the game even more past tvhm."

Borderlands2,3cq2z8,saberishungry,5,Thu Jul 9 22:05:11 2015 UTC,"It's almost certain at max-level that you'll be farming for gear off bosses that will be much better than what you can get from golden keys anyway.  If you're only sitting on a scarce amount (which really shouldn't be the case with all the codes out there), then maybe I can see saving them for when you first hit the level cap. For the most part though, golden keys are more about making the road to max level easier.  It's not like hoarding keys is a bad thing, but it's honestly unnecessary if you've got a decent amount stashed up. Might as well burn a few when you start seeing mobs take no damage so you can keep up."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,saberishungry,2,Thu Jul 9 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm currently at about 147 Golden Keys, I believe. I have no experience from Max Level, so I thought I'd save a decent amount for the chest once I hit max level.  This is great information for me though, thanks alot!"
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,DownvotesForCliches,3,Thu Jul 9 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, 147 is definitely an amount where you can use some keys to ease your leveling.  My first character ever in BL2 was also Axton, and I hoarded like a crazy mofo while struggling at times with the content... only to discover I hardly ever used the keys once I got to bosses that dropped great loot.  My 2nd character (Maya) actually started using too many of the keys I had to stop or else it became too easy with a constant flow of purples lol.   That being said, they're definitely great for when you're really struggling and just need that extra boost to stay on par with the mobs you're fighting. I found a nice balance for my personal playstyle was to use mostly loot I found, but use keys a few times when I started falling behind, or when my preferred weapon was underleveled and needed an upgrade badly."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,DownvotesForCliches,2,Thu Jul 9 23:48:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll definetly have to use a few then, in order to get a nice shield, or a few good weapons."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,BobeHarvard,3,Fri Jul 10 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to use golden keys, they are useful purple items but do outscale quickly, once you can farm some legendaries you won't bother using the keys anymore. 100% reccomend the DLC, especially Tiny Tina's Attack on Dragon Keep. I also strongly reccomend the two ultimate upgrade packs which increase the level cap to 72 (and adds OP difficulties too). I use a commando a lot and really enjoy it, tho trying to solo Digistruct peak is pretty frustrating. Feel free to ask me about using the Commando."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,BobeHarvard,2,Thu Jul 9 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"Great response, thank you!  I'll have you know I was hesitant about buying the DLC's untill I was level 50, for then to unlock additional level caps. However I'll follow your advice and get the upgrade pack to level 72, and Tiny Tina's Attack on Dragon Keep."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,BobeHarvard,2,Thu Jul 9 23:17:00 2015 UTC,"No problem man, look for a bundle where you can get both packs and they 4 main DLC, it's worth it. Season pass 2 or something like that. It also unlocks the 2 other classes."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,BobeHarvard,3,Fri Jul 10 00:11:57 2015 UTC,What is the exact gear you are using? I never had trouble on the TVHM. Now the UVHM is hard if you aren't prepared. I usually have 1-3 legendary items equipped by the time I'm at where you are.
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,HanzsKlopek,3,Thu Jul 9 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"I used one Golden Key to get a few purple weapons, and currently I'm not using any legendaries, as none have dropped so far in my progress.  I've never properly understood people ""Farming"" bosses. I'm barelly able to get past a few of them."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,Zoltorion,2,Thu Jul 9 21:45:11 2015 UTC,You just fight the same boss a few times until they drop a sweet item. I usually farm 1-3 bosses for some gear before moving to TVHM. Or just swap between characters. What system are you on? PC? If it was PS3 I could load you up on gear. Also on a side not Axton is the weakest to play with in TVHM and on. Eventually your turret doesn't do much. The slag does help in UVHM but it will be destroyed super fast.
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,baseballgrow6,2,Thu Jul 9 21:49:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies, BobeHarvard!  Could you answer me one more thing: If I were to go back in a few chapters now, and farm a few bosses will the items they drop scale to my level? As I'm sure, a legendary that's level 36 won't do much for me at 41 and above."
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,nakedapedude,2,Thu Jul 9 21:55:21 2015 UTC,It depends on the legendary. I used a level 9 Double Penetrating Unkempt Harold up until level 29. I'd farm a few bosses if I were you or join a game and trade. Just remember the level of the gear doesn't matter. It's the stats. What's the damage? How's the reload speed? Accuracy? If I have a level 39 shotgun it does 900 damage and reloads in 2 seconds with a clip that holds ten rounds....I'd use that over a level 44 shotgun that does 1200 damage reloads in 5 seconds and holds 6 rounds. It's all about the stats. Eventually you'll have to farm gear though.
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,BobeHarvard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"You've been a great help, and I'll try to give it a go. I'll start my research on which bosses I can farm as of now, in TVHM and see where I end up after that. :)"
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,nakedapedude,2,Thu Jul 9 22:14:52 2015 UTC,No problem. Feel free to PM me anytime if you have questions.
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,nakedapedude,2,Thu Jul 9 22:18:33 2015 UTC,Easiest and best weapons to farm in my opinion : Hornet (Knuckledragger outside of Claptrap's place) Unkempt Harold (Savage Lee in Three Horns) Other than that I would suggest you to grind a couple of levels before going on with the main quest. Sidequest or just farming will help you get good xp and the rest of the quest will be easier. Hang in there Vault Hunter :)
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,nakedapedude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:26:41 2015 UTC,That's a great tip! I'll note that down!
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,mightybonk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:38:23 2015 UTC,Hornet is a seriously powerful gun.  I used a level 33 hornet that dropped when killing knuckledragger at the beginning of TVHM as my go-to corrosive gun until level 50 (end of TVHM).
Borderlands2,3cq2z8,mightybonk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:52:32 2015 UTC,Is that so? I'll have to give Knuckledragger a few kills to try that one out then.

I think this is caused by downloading the upgrade pack 2(lvls 61-72) before getting the first upgrade pack (lvls 50-61)"
Borderlands2,3cnkn1,Codered218,13,Thu Jul 9 08:09:01 2015 UTC,"IMO BL2 has had one of the best communities any game has ever seen. The game is almost 3 years old. TBH im impressed that it has maintained its relevance as long as it has. It has had a ton of post release support from the development team. Tons of DLC, the loot hunt, loot the world app, headhunter packs, 2 re-releases, and a clatrap fridge giveaway. I really cant think of any other game that has done as much for its community.   As u/lobster_knight stated constant sales have kept new players coming, but there really isn't much left to do for youtubers in a game thats been out this long. Its all been done before. Every character has been played, exploited, and completely figured out. We have found every secret and even some unintended exploits. Every inch of this game has been explored. There simply isnt anything interesting left for youtubers to do with BL2 IMO.  I certainly wouldn't say that the community is ""falling apart"" Its just dying out as any community as old as BL2 would. Its not ""decaying"" its aging. New games come out. Players move on. Its ok. Its a part of a games life cycle. The presequal was a great desert to BL2, but BL3 will be upon us soon enough and players will return, worry not."
Borderlands2,3cnkn1,slimjim72384,16,Thu Jul 9 13:43:47 2015 UTC,Just because a lot of the streamers are leaving doesn't mean the community is dying. Borderlands 2 is probably going to constantly get new members due to Steam sales and people just hearing about it constantly.
Borderlands2,3cnkn1,lobster_knight,8,Thu Jul 9 08:34:39 2015 UTC,"Started 2 days ago.   Lower population does not mean the game's over.   People still play pso, for example."

I'm just getting into this game now, and to show up for the first time on this subreddit and see this as one of the top posts... More than a little disheartening.

First time through the story is fantastic, and with all the DLC available you should get to around level 50 from original content alone.  As for replayability, I have to admit; it will be boring. Don't get me wrong, I have 3 max leveled characters and love this game like mad. I have played through every mission 10+ times and could honestly keep going.  But it is slow, grindy gameplay. It will be less about enjoyable missions and more about looking forward to that next skill or piece of gear.

Borderlands 2 on the other hand I have played for countless amounts of hours on PC, Xbox 360, and Xbox 1. I have maxed out like 4 or 5 characters at this point and the game doesn't get old for me. On top of the main game being a ton of fun you also get ALL the DLC for FREE in the Handsome Collection. Yes I did just say free DLC, which you don't hear very often  The Handsome Collection also includes The Pre Sequel which is my opinion wasn't the greatest game in the world, but I was playing it before it was all patched and fixed up, back when the level cap was only 50 and bosses didn't respawn.

Borderlands2,3co02d,zerocasper,4,Thu Jul 9 11:44:37 2015 UTC,I think this is a fantastic idea. I will take part in this no doubt.
Borderlands2,3co02d,orangemofo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:06:24 2015 UTC,Glad you like it. If you have any friends that are interested and play bl2 tell them. :)
Borderlands2,3co02d,orangemofo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"Hopefully we can do different maps too, like Hero's Pass or various others. Also, the Xbox One and PS4 both have very easy gameplay recording options so I hope this idea really takes off."
Borderlands2,3co02d,orangemofo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:29:11 2015 UTC,Yeah definately. Southpaw was just a recommendation because many people seem to like it. I have quite a few other maps in my mind too. I only hope more people will respond.

Borderlands2,3co02d,ChaoticSmiley,4,Sun Jul 19 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"I am going to c/p what I wrote on the Gearbox forum.   How would you be able to tally all these parameters. What exactly go into deciding who has the ""best run"". consecutive crits? no moxxi? no bee? no slag? no red text? time limit? Regular UVHM?, OP8?, Perfect gibbed gear or farmed? Unique build? etc etc etc. I like to hear your thoughts on this. Do you have a system in mind to avoid any potential bickering.  And do you need a sponsor for the prize pool?"
Borderlands2,3co02d,ChaoticSmiley,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"I see your point and i was going to talk about all these when and if we will eventually gather a lot of people. Regarding the gear certain weapons will be banned for certain characters to make it more challenging. Also legendaries seraphs and pearls will be banned for every class. Players can use uniques , red text weapons, purples, greens and even whites which will not be banned for their class. Regarding the rating system it will be up to each and every one of us who will take part and everyone will vote for what they thinks was the best run. The voting criteria will be gear rarity, time, multiple executions, crits and level difficulty.  Edit : Didnt have enough time to answer  all of your questions so i will do it now. Everyone will be able to use slag as it is a vital mechanic for high levels. Also every level will be able to take part, from lvl 1 up to OP8 but when we vote we should keep in mind the level difficulty. Bee will be banned as well as every other legendary item. Some moxxie weapons will be banned for some characters who can abuse them very well and also grog nozzle will be banned for every class. Now for the prize i will need some help as i dont play online but we will eventually find someone who can help with that part. Hope i answered all of your questions. Tell me if you are interested in this or no."
Borderlands2,3cph7j,Torterrable,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"It depends, but it should be level 30  If you accepted the mission to fight tinder at level 15, but never beat him, then he, as well as his loot, will be levl 15. Just restart your game after beating him, turning in the mission, and saving to farm him at level 30.  If you acepted the mission at level 15 and beat him already as well as turned in the mission, then when you return, he will respawn and you can fight him at level 30, dropping level 30 loot.  IIRC, the loot train is a seperate event that is not tied to the mission (although triggered by defeating tinder) so should spawn loot at level regardless"
Borderlands2,3cph7j,slimjim72384,0,Thu Jul 9 19:12:17 2015 UTC,Once you enter UVHM it always scales. Before that it scales to the level you enter in first. So if you hop in Tina dlc at level 22 and come back at level 30 it will give you some 21-24 level loot. Once you enter TVHM you can do it one more time but I'd suggest you wait until after beating the game around level 50.
Borderlands2,3cn5pg,TheGamingHermit,5,Thu Jul 9 05:07:12 2015 UTC,"If there's some window dressing or something unique/entertaining about the videos apart from weapon drops it might be worth a look, but honestly I don't think watching RNG for an already confirmed legendary drop rate would do it for me."

Borderlands2,3clv27,LoveDubstep,21,Wed Jul 8 22:36:21 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you buying all of the dlcs (big 4) plus head hunters. From big 4, best dlc is definitely Tiny Tinas Assault of Dragon keep, it is like separate game and it is really fun to play. From headhunters, Mercenary Day is usually used for farming chests, money."

Borderlands2,3clv27,Dustin-,2,Thu Jul 9 01:01:57 2015 UTC,I would say Tiny Tina's > Mr. Torgue's > Captain Scarlett's > Hammerlock's in terms of DLC quality.
Borderlands2,3clv27,dunks6666,12,Thu Jul 9 06:49:39 2015 UTC,"Buy Tiny Tina's dragon keep- it is the best dlc in BL2. Marcus' mercenary day is also very good as it has two very easy chest to farm, and captain Scarlett's dlc includes some of the best weapons; sandhawk and pimpernel. Buy the season pass, it's like £20, you get 4 campaign dlcs and one UVHM pack, buy the other and mercernary day. When you can you should buy all the dlc like I did, it is totally worth it"

The Gearbox website says so, but it doesn't mention him in the PSN Store description.  Edit: Didn't read the contents of the Season Pass correctly, thought Krieg was included."
Borderlands2,3clv27,Will2Survive,6,Thu Jul 9 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, get the Game of the Year edition. It's probably cheaper than that, and you get the four main packs plus the two characters."
Borderlands2,3clv27,miss_moxxie,4,Thu Jul 9 02:51:38 2015 UTC,"Assault on dragon keep is fantastic: a good level of challenge, lots of new quests, great items, wonderful touching story with plenty of character development, and a lot of fun as someone who has played dnd.  The pirate one (can't remember its name): very good, nice and big, good amount of quests, new characters, new enemies, and a good final boss fight.  The wattle gobbler and the hungry harvest: funny, basically ripped from the hunger games, mr torgue is funny, surprisingly short (I finished it in less than an afternoon.)  Campaign of Carnage: real big, plenty of tough bosses, new guns, interesting to see other corporations other than hyperion, good round of fun.  Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt: the game is too big, it looked like some fun quests, but it was nigh impossible to make any progress without repeated death, I went in with my two friends (who are both better than me) we were decent level (40ish something) we had almost no effect on the monsters maybe got a dozen kills and twice as many deaths then we ran and had a hell of a time getting out to a fast travel.  I haven't been back yet. maybe I'll try again now that I'm higher  level (zero lvl53)  Kreig: the best, he is a lot of fun to play both mechanically and storywise.  can be pure melee or based on explosive or fire weapons so much fun he has kinda ruined all the other characters for me"

One thing I do like Is that each character had their own custom quotes during the story, and every character referred to you as the name of your character, not just ""vault hunter"". It is minor feature that I personally liked. As for gameplay, I enjoyed double jumping and zero gravity at certain places. Cryo weapons were pretty fun also. If you love the borderlands series and want more content, I would say get it. But be warned early, you probably won't play it as much as you played bl2."

Borderlands2,3cm179,SnarkMasterRay,3,Thu Jul 9 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's worth a look, some fun new mechanics, interesting classes and claptastic voyage is a rad DLC. If you enjoy borderlands you'll probably get something out of it."

Borderlands2,3cm179,vzDesirezv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:15:20 2015 UTC,Huge fan of Borderlands 2 here. I bought the Pre Sequel on sale. I'd suggest you do the same. Don't pay more than 20$ for that game. It's nice .. don't get me wrong. But it's definitely not as good as Borderlands 2. Period.

Borderlands2,3clqhf,VahrunePrefect,6,Wed Jul 8 22:28:16 2015 UTC,Surprised nobody has said Yoteslaya.
Borderlands2,3clqhf,CokeFryChezbrgr,2,Thu Jul 9 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"He has an amazing legendary, pearlescent, and seraph item guide, and some of the best gameplay for bl2 imo."
Borderlands2,3clqhf,DHGPizzaNinja,2,Thu Jul 9 01:14:04 2015 UTC,MorninAfterKill (MAK). Some find his laugh annoying but I think he's hilarious. Good watch.
Borderlands2,3clqhf,NeedAnEarlyNight,2,Thu Jul 9 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"Admiral bahroo is the best. Hands down, he has guides on basically everything.  Rleeson85 has op8 builds and downloads for each character. Masterkizz does some interesting guides. Joltzdude139 does some amazing speed kills. Man of low moral fiber can be a good watch, however he is very close minded and if you disagree with him he won't like you, I believe some of the things he says to be wrong; such as the infinity is shit in zero when it really isn't, but he thinks it is. He does however have some good guides on zero and guns though. King Gothalion and Morninafterkill are decent, and do coop with bahroo but bahroo is definetly the best"
Borderlands2,3clqhf,dunks6666,-2,Wed Jul 8 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"Admiral bahroo is the best. Hands down...   He said he was ""Looking for an interesting personality, someone that is fun to watch and fun to listen to and who commentates well."" How can one person be better than the other at personality? Or at being fun to watch? Everyone has a favorite. Honestly, Bahroo seems to have fake and exaggerated reactions. I don't like that, so I don't watch him. MoLMF is usually very serious, talks about interesting and important subjects (Yote's death), and doesn't give a shit about what other people think of him. I like that, so I watch him."

Morninafterkill has the best personality out of anyone ive ever seen and he's really funny and has a great sense of humor. King Gothalion has a lot of ninja stuff and is a really funny person. Bahroo is really serious during a lot of videos but I still love him he uses cheat engine a lot to make really fun stuff possible and has tons of great videos that are just silly but hilarious at the same time. Some other good ones are Rleeson85 he posts a lot of cool world drops. Joltzdude139 posts a lot of cool 1 shots on raid bosses and cool montages. Man of low moral fiber is very opinionated and is very informative. And last but certainly not least is Yoteslaya. He has since passed away but his videos from when he was alive were all great.

Borderlands2,3cgsxb,lazyfoo3,5,Tue Jul 7 20:11:52 2015 UTC,Sniper is the highest DPS build in the game. Melee on the other hand is tankier since it utilizes more Decepti0n and Moxxi abuse.
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,brandpanz,4,Tue Jul 7 21:29:22 2015 UTC,"I have 2 Zer0s (both op8) one dedicated to sniping, and the other to melee. I can say that it really depends on your playstyle, situation, and skill. Sniper Zer0 has a much higher reward for skill and is much safer to play, although he is harder to level. Melee Zer0 also requires skill, just not as much and it's not as rewarding. Although he is (arguably) better against mobbing and a few bosses.  Personally I think Sniper Zer0 is more powerful, strategic, and safe, although not as fun. Who can say no to cutting down enemy after enemy?"
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,8988303682,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:13:33 2015 UTC,How is melee zero not as rewarding as sniper zero? I'd really like melee zero as I'm up front and slashing my way. I do have some experience as sniper zero not as much and wondering why its much more higher reward than melee?
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,8988303682,2,Thu Jul 9 20:43:03 2015 UTC,"Sniper Zer0 has a much higher DPS. Even at op8 I will only use slag for badasses and certain enemies with large amounts of health (Gravediggers, Goliaths, Tubbies, etc.) Melee Zer0 does have incredible amounts of burst damage and it's not terribly difficult to reach the damage cap, but he is not as reliable. The process to get ready to kill an enemy is much longer and more difficult than with Sniper Zer0 and there is only a limited time in which he can inflict significant damage. He also struggles with flying enemies, as he has to wait for them to land or be directly above him."
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,FalloutFanatic,3,Thu Jul 9 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"I haven't played as melee Zero, so I can't comment on that. I have played as sniper Zero and was able to get from lvl 50 to 72 without using slag or farming for legendaries, so I would probably give my vote to sniper Zero."
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,elcabezon09,2,Tue Jul 7 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"As another sniper zer0, how did you do it? I had good gear but got pummeled without slag."
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,FalloutFanatic,4,Tue Jul 7 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"I relied heavily on Critical Asceni0n. Fights would start out rough, with my sniper tickling them in the case of tougher enemies, but would quickly snowball into me dealing serious damage. I found green and purple jakobs snipers to be the best in terms of damage, fire rate, and ammo consumption, though E-Tech snipers proved even more devastating once I had built up stacks. I also relied heavily on deception and one shot one kill; both for taking out problem enemies quickly and deception for getting out of no-win situations. B0re also proved helpful in some instances.  I do have to emphasize that while I did, it was by no means a cake walk. While loaders and many human enemies weren't bad, many enemies were awfull without bruteforcing through them with slag. Most animals except crystalisks, bullymongs, and rakk were a chore to fight, as hitting the critical spot with a sniper was difficult. Some human enemies like shielded nomads and rats were a pain too. In a lot of these cases, deception and a high pellet count shotgun or rockets were used to get the job done.  If you want, I can post my build to give you a better idea of how I did it."
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,FalloutFanatic,2,Tue Jul 7 22:00:11 2015 UTC,"Please do, I only seen like one sniper build and that was man of low moral fiber."
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,dunks6666,2,Thu Jul 9 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it's important, but I'll also include order of perks chosen, so you have a better idea of how I progressed through the game. I started my build by going down the sniping skill tree. I chose: +5 headshot, +5 killer, +1 bore, +5 one shot one kill, +5 velocity, +5 kill confirmed, +5 one with the gun, +1 critical ascencion.  I then went down the the cunning tree and got the following: +5 fast hands, +5 fearless, +5 rising shot, +5 innervate  Finally, I went down the bloodshed skill tree for some more kill skills. I chose: +5 iron hand, +5 grim, +5 followthrough  Gearwise, I used a lot of the same gear or types of gear as I went from level 50 to 72. I always had a sniper equipped and started off sticking just to green (surprisingly I got away with using greens a large portion of my play through) and purple jakobs sniper rifles for the reasons above. I also grew to like vladof snipers (blue and up) for their fire rate and ability to build stacks quickly, but didn't use them often due to their ammo consumption. I also carried as good a shotgun as I could find as I played, by which I mean with as high of a damage and pellet count as I could find to deal with problem enemies. I also carried a rocket launcher for clutch second winds and killing difficult enemies. The fourth equipped weapon varied and I never found myself using anything particular for it.  Now for non-gun gear. I used any good shield that I could find, but found myself using amplify shields and absorb shields the most. The com I used most was the blue one for bonus sniper damage and critical damage, with +6 headshot and +5 one shot one kill being my favorite. For relics, I went back and forth between a jakobs allegiance, depending on equipped guns, and a stockpe relic. The nice part about these relics, is that the level isn't super important, since the bonuses are still good even when they are lower level. As for the grenade, I kind of cheated and used the contraband sky rocket from the HJC. I did use transfusion grenades sometimes and liked how they make up for zero's lacking ability to regen health.  Once I got to lvl 72, my gear changed dramatically with gear I had found on other playthroughs. I use the bee and sham shields, with the sham being especially stupid with grim. I also upgraded to the legendary sniper com. The two snipers I've found to be really effective are the Hawkeye and the skullmasher, though I dream of getting a good lyuda.The other two guns I have equipped are also snipers, so as to maintain critical ascension, but vary depending on the situation. Lastly, I use a fastball as my grenade, just because of its high dps and how stupid it is to throw it in deception.  The end result is a sniperslinger sort of Zero. If you have any other questions about perks or gear feel free to ask. I haven't played Zero as much as ManOfLowMoralFiber, but I'm always glad to help.  Edit: Just looked up Man of low Moral Fiber's build after typing all that. I realized that our skill tree set ups are similar, he's just refined and min/maxed it more than I have. Oh well. I hope that I've been able to help out some way, instead of just showing you what you've already seen."
Borderlands2,3cgsxb,Whhatsmyageagain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"IMO melee is better for mobbing as you can one shot most enemies with the correct build and gear, however sniping is much better for raiding as you can pimp+bee everything to death. I play melee zero and a specially built gun zero- focuses on sandhawks, pimpernels and the infinity rather than full on sniping, as I prefer my 'forever alone' gun zero build to sniping in general."

For the relics I would go and farm some loot midgets. If you haven't completed Tannis' mission in the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve do not complete that mission. If you don't know where the loot midgets will be I will link a video. They can drop Ancient Relics and possible legendaries so win win.   For the COMs I would do soon treasure room runs or farm a health vending machine. Otherwise you can kill terra for a Slayer of Terra COM.  And finally for the Sandhawk... You would either have to trade with someone for it, gib it, or reset UVHM multiple times and get to that specific mission.

You know you can duplicate weapons, right? We just enter a trade, I offer the Conference Call, we hit DUEL, then I change it into my loadout and drop it. Then you kill me. The game figures you won the duel, so you get the gun. Meanwhile, it's also lying on the ground now so I go pick it up and we both have one.  My xbl tag is themightybonk"

Borderlands2,3cfgmi,596Franky,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yes he does respawn, therefore he's farmable. However it's kind of a slow farm, because you need to kill lots of enemies before you manage to get to him and I also had pretty much no luck with his legendary drop.

Borderlands2,3cbbz5,SakiatoMakiato,12,Tue Jul 7 05:41:54 2015 UTC,Then what would you suggest we post?
Borderlands2,3cbbz5,DekuNut,18,Mon Jul 6 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Literally almost anything else, I feel.  Glitches, fan theories, strategy questions/discussions, artwork - all of these are interesting, unique contributions to the community.  If this were a different game, I may feel differently, but the loot system is pretty much the base mechanic behind the entire franchise. It's been studied and deconstructed so damn thoroughly.  In my example: everyone knows that Savage Lee has an increased chance of dropping the Harold.  If you're farming for it, you know it as well.  I get that you'd be excited to get it, but it's was literally what you expected to happen.    Clearly there's some appeal that I'm not seeing though since a) people post keep posting them, and b) people keep upvoting them.  I just don't get it myself."
Borderlands2,3cbbz5,DekuNut,7,Mon Jul 6 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"People like to share their successes. Especially if they play it solo or have been farming for it for a long time. Though I agree that even within these types of posts there are varying degrees of quality. I prefer if they do more than just post a screenshot of a legendary item and say ""Look what I got!"" There are ways to make [Loot] posts more discussion-centric. If OP says where they got it, how long it took them, why they wanted it, how they plan on incorporating it into their current build, ask how others like that item, etc. Maybe you can throw the mods a suggestion on how to improve them?  And it's not like these types of posts are flooding the subreddit. I usually see 2-3 a day. I mean, as of right now there are only two [Loot] posts on the front page. But the rest of it is pretty much what you already suggest.   Also, it's just like a law of Reddit that pictures always get way more upvotes than anything else."
Borderlands2,3cbbz5,Anigav11190,3,Mon Jul 6 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you say, 100%.  If it's somehow noteworthy or discussion-worthy, awesome, I'm all for it.  I think someone posted something a while back along the lines of, they opened a single chest and it had a legendary and two pearls, or something - in my opinion (emphasis because all this is just from one jackass on the internet) this makes a decent post because it's something genuinely unexpected.  But finding an orange in a chest, or getting a drop from a boss?    And yes, they're far from flooding the subreddit, it's still a majority ""good"" posts.  It just perplexes me though that these are the ones that seem to be actually get the upvotes, and subsequently are the most visible.  I don't claim to have any 'solutions' because again, there's still clearly a large population posting and upvoting, so it's not that the people don't want them.  In ayitasaurus's dream world, all of these posts would be in a separate subreddit where people can go be happy for each other.  I'm not here to hand out pitchforks though."
Borderlands2,3cbbz5,SuperPipe,4,Mon Jul 6 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like seeing other people's ridiculous luck from time to time like that. For instance, last week I pulled a 92% Sham out of a chest and posted it. I know the woes of farming Bunker for a high-percentage Sham and thought some people might get a kick out of me finding an almost-perfect variation with minimal effort. Maybe it was a low-effort post, but I at least tried to be engaging in the comments to make up for it!  I agree with your points though. Except your dream world! It is a game built on finding good loot, it's practically how they advertise it, and I think people sharing their findings is a relevant part of the community if they actually find it worth sharing. I bet if the mods required these to be self posts, we'd only see the ones that people legitimately want to share with others for the sake of discussion/amusement rather than just farming for karma.  This subreddit could always follow the trend of many other subreddits, and eventually we'll have a /r/trueBorderlands2 that forbids images :-)"

Borderlands2,3cb20r,RaveDigger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:02:32 2015 UTC,Thanks man. Yeah I have a lot to learn with Maya. Do you mainly use SMG with the Cat Mod ? Thanks for sharing your build. I was about trying Scorn (the last skill down the middle tree). Any opinion on that?
Borderlands2,3cb20r,RaveDigger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:42:23 2015 UTC,"IMO, Maya's healing tree isn't very useful. When playing with friends it can be beneficial, but really all I need is Res. I wouldn't spec into Scorn, it just isn't useful if you have the Ruin and Sub-Sequence combo. I can slag an entire room with one Phaselock. I mostly use SMGs and pistols and a few shotguns. I really love plasma casters and are easy to come by. The Sandhawk of course is also a deadly weapon, even without the Bee. My typical loadout is Grog, Sandhawk, DPUH, Norfleet, Antagonist, Ancient relic and Legendary cat mod."

Even after we stopped playing I still had them."
Borderlands2,3cdym5,z9nine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:12:32 2015 UTC,On the PS3 you can force this to happen. All you have to do is load a character in split screen and they'll have the keys. Great way to farm the chest on a toon if you run out of keys. Just load whatever toon you want as player two.   Once you remove the character they lose any keys they didn't use but keep the weapons. I wouldn't call it a glitch since it has never been fixed and has been known about for a long ass time.

Borderlands2,3ccywm,AGWednesday,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:46:54 2015 UTC,"Cloud Kill only activates once every 5 seconds, IIRC, so the speed of your gun doesn't really matter. I like to use it with a sniper, though. I pick someone in the middle of a crowd, snipe 'em, pull the crowd together with Phaselock + Converge to get the whole set infected by the cloud.  I noticed you were having a little trouble with the armored bandits. Cloud Kill and everything else acid are great for that.  By the way, really nice gear, and congrats on the Inifinity."

Unless you want to reset UVHM which restarts the story at your current level.    Drops from enemies that respawn can be farmed at any level as the items they drop will always be the scaled to your level.

Borderlands2,3ccf9i,lazyfoo3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:54:46 2015 UTC,Do all previously completed side quests become available again when you start UVHM? Which means you can get quest rewards again at a higher level than last time you completed it?

Borderlands2,3c8ws7,FalloutFanatic,3,Mon Jul 6 00:48:56 2015 UTC,It can drop if you don't have the dlc. It's probably the drop rate increase that made it drop so readily.
Borderlands2,3c8ws7,chuckyboy311,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:33:10 2015 UTC,The drop rate used to be broken (1 in 1000 I believe instead of 1 in 30) so the easiest way was with the dlc

Borderlands2,3c7krs,ProfessorPorch,11,Sun Jul 5 17:12:11 2015 UTC,"Get a booster shield. They're actually incredible against DoTs, and it'll allow you to lure Gee while you just face-tank the acid.  Spam E (X on 360? Whatever your pickup is) while running backwards.  Once his shields are down he's no worse than Pete. This has been my strategy for quite some time on an OP8 Maya, hope it helps :)"
Borderlands2,3c7krs,vSmash__,5,Sun Jul 5 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"Works especially well if your booster shield is the Big Boom Blaster, which restores Grenade ammo and I think Rocket ammo every time you pick up a booster.  I find that Gee is incredibly simple if you can handle him, compared to other Raid bosses. Sure he takes a while, but he is still rather simple."
Borderlands2,3c7krs,ShinkuTear,6,Sun Jul 5 22:14:18 2015 UTC,This. Big Boom Blaster with singularity grenades to manipulate Gee make this super easy. Absorb a single acid pool and the boosters will continuously drop. Just make sure to pick up a booster before your shields drop
Borderlands2,3c7krs,likwidstylez,5,Sun Jul 5 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"I agree. He is such a bullshit gimmick boss. I was soo happy when I finally beat him. I can't help you with any weapons though, sorry."

Borderlands2,3c7krs,_sLAUGHTER234,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:17:47 2015 UTC,It's the highest damaging rocket launcher in the game and will outperform when Pimp-Habbing or Flak swapping.
Borderlands2,3c7krs,likwidstylez,0,Sun Jul 5 22:57:49 2015 UTC,"Yes it has the highest damage but its not great when it comes to utility because it has such a low blast radius, whereas the nukem, norfleet, etc, do. I personally only use launchers for reviving, but if you're looking to spam them at a boss, the ahab would be fine"
Borderlands2,3c7krs,a_disabled_penguin,0,Sun Jul 5 23:02:33 2015 UTC,Only way to get a norfleet is to farm vermivorous. And then you need RNGesus to drop that instead of a class mod. I've farmed hyperius enough to know his drop rate is probably less than 1% pre drop rate buff. I'm using the Ahab for more fight for your life until I get a Creamer
Borderlands2,3c7krs,a_disabled_penguin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"I totally forgot about the creamer, its guaranteed that you get it after round 5 so its actually very good especially because it has the moxxi heal"

Borderlands2,3c7krs,transframer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:35:54 2015 UTC,"Under 3 mins: merge 2 lady fist (or a lady fist and a trespasser), grog nozzle and Lyuda. Infinite ammo. Rough rider, some sort of fire rate increase (skill, class mode, relic). Trick him to come close to the shelf (where the gate is). The worms will spawn there frequently and will be close to Gee so he can swallow the acid. In order to make him take any damage he must take at least one acid pool. Keep firing him non-stop, Lyuda has big fire rate and will be able to heal you (via Grog nozzle merge) fast enough. When worms spawn near Gee kill them to speed up the process."
Borderlands2,3c7krs,AbuRiyam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"After 2 hours of trying and failing, I went to the method I used first time I killed him.  First, you have to lead him into 2-3 traps and make sure he sucks all the acid.  Then go to the gate and hide behind the rock, thats it. It will take around 15-20 min and he will die. If you want to hill him faster, then lead him into more traps."
Borderlands2,3c7krs,transframer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:06:11 2015 UTC,Besides being boring and slow this method may not work most of times. If you don't attack Gee for some time he will just disappear from the scene and you have to re-start the process.
Borderlands2,3c7krs,caffeine314,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"After about 2 years of playing, I've finally mastered killing him, and it takes significantly less time than an hour.  Bee (high damage for when his shield is gone) + singularity grenades (to pull him into the acidic worm holes) + fancy dodging (to dodge the harpoon) + deathtrap (to pull his attention away from you).  The effects of dosage(? I forget what it's called) are cumulative.   When I pull him into the corrosive holes 6-8 times the fight maybe lasts 20 minutes.  All you need to do is get his shield down and then he becomes a mere mortal.  I still wouldn't call it ""easy"", but ""me"" from 2 years ago would never believe today's ""me"" about how doable it is."
Borderlands2,3c90yu,njb98x,2,Mon Jul 6 00:57:18 2015 UTC,Don't do any more DLC or side quests etc until you're in UVHM and get there asap.

Borderlands2,3c9dlj,z9nine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:24:11 2015 UTC,What's your point? Obviously it can drop from any lootable source but the chance of a world drop is much lower than 3%. The 3% allocation of drops was the number that applied to the INCREASED chance of dropping from certain enemies - in this case Savage Lee. Edit: Before the drop rate increase world drop chances were roughly 1:10000 - probably slightly higher now.

Claptrap doesn't successfully open them and another set of doors closes and you have to fight off turrets and whatnot while claptrap hacks the doors open.

The bee is a must but has very little defense power. It leaves you almost defenseless. Unless you use Grog nozzle too but this is only available legit on a certain side mission. Other healing weapons are not healing fast enough to provide protection (actually this is true many times for Grog Nozzle too ).

Each one contains a small main quest line, one side quest or one secret quest, and a boss.  I would say the Christmas pack is 100% definitely worth the money. After killing the boss a train will come by with 4 larger-than-normal red chests, and they have been known to house some crazy good loot.  As for the others, ehh. The Valentine's Day one has a nice story and a really fun and interesting boss. The Halloween one was very entertaining because you get to reunite with a friend from BL1, also the atmosphere is great. The Crawmerax one was hilarious and offered a pretty solid way to farm. The turkey one was trash."

Borderlands2,3c2t0p,bahgheera,9,Sat Jul 4 05:50:32 2015 UTC,Slag is what you need. What character are you?
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,eshrektpenis,6,Sat Jul 4 06:02:36 2015 UTC,"I am a lvl 51 Assassin. In the first two go's, it didn't seem like slag really helped much - my main issue with slag is that you have to switch to another weapon after slagging, and by then the slag has worn off. I spent so much time switching weapons that I could get overpowered easily, so it was easierr just to go with conventional weapons or other elelmentals."
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,eshrektpenis,7,Sat Jul 4 06:28:56 2015 UTC,"5/5 in fast hands, get a slag pimpernal and bind your weapons to keys and memorize the key for the pimpernel. My zero has no problem slagging enemies"
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,christador,3,Sat Jul 4 06:31:15 2015 UTC,"Aha, I didn't know you could bind specific weapons to keys. I'll look into this. Thanks! (Also, where do I get a slag pimpernal?)"
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,eshrektpenis,3,Sat Jul 4 06:41:59 2015 UTC,A slag Rubi (Moxxi quest reward for completing Rakkaholic's Annonymous) or better yet a Grog Nozzle (Tiny Tina's DLC) so you heal at the same time you're slagging.
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,oi-__-io,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"It's from the quest don't copy that floppy at washburne refinery in the captain Scarlet dlc, the pimpernal can come in all elements so save before turning in the quest and if you don't get it quit then try again"
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,nakedapedude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:02:27 2015 UTC,I use grog nozzle/pimper nail for slag but most of the time death blossoms do that job for me I love the Assassin. Also you would need legendary at least blue gears for good survivability I have a level 52 and a level 72 Assassin.
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,TheSinner,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"The whole design of UVHM is slag first. The slag effect lasts much longer than in TVHM and damage to slagged enemies has been increased while weapon swap time has been decreased. UVHM is a big wake up call when you first start, a different game. When you know how it works and get the right build and weapons you'll love it."
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,Warhawg01,14,Sat Jul 4 09:36:15 2015 UTC,Literally everything has to be slagged. Mobs will take practically 0 damage until slagged
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,TheSinner,2,Sat Jul 4 06:01:06 2015 UTC,"Literally? No. Slag helps, but it is not absolutely required."
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,Notsslyvi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"You're right, I used literally incorrectly. However, the difference between damage of slagged and unslagged mobs is so huge it may as well be required. So no you aren't required to slag mobs, but that is definitely what they intended."
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,erians,5,Mon Jul 6 00:40:14 2015 UTC,Early levels in UVHM are killer and slag is a huge help. When you close up on level cap slag is still really useful but not entirely needed. I had an Anarchy Gaige who pretty much wrecked everything and I didn't even use slag. Conference Call ALL THE THINGS.
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,DekuNut,3,Sat Jul 4 06:13:36 2015 UTC,"UVHM suffers from a reversed difficulty curve. It starts out freaking impossible and every time you level the mobs just get stronger while drops are scarce. Enemies are outscaling your equipment fast.  Then you hit 72 and bother with getting the best gear in the game and soon the difficulty becomes a joke instead. High end gear quickly and completely eclipses badasses, bosses and even raid bosses. Everything becomes extremely easily soloable.  Its also noteworthy that UVHM didn't exist when the game was released, so it was most likely designed for people with great gear from TVHM that wanted more challange. Jumping straight into UVHM from TVHM without farming gear will be almost impossible. UVHM The DLCs also makes things a lot easier too. Torque Token DPUH, Magic missiles, grog nozzle, sand hawks and many other easily accessible power items make UVHM manageable."
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,Sundevil13,3,Sat Jul 4 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"Along with slagging, make sure your gear is appropriate level. For most guns, nothing more than like 2 levels below you, otherwise you won't have a good time."
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,LuxOG,2,Sat Jul 4 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"The design works because TVHM is slightly harder but still worth playing through again. Then, when you go to UVHM, it doesn't feel repetitive because it's even harder and requires completely new strategies."
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,Blackie_Chann,2,Sat Jul 4 07:23:58 2015 UTC,Everyone's saying slag everything. You can also get a bee shield.
Borderlands2,3c2t0p,EC-10,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah Bee works for a lot of the players but IMO, the Bee sucks for mobbing, I love The Antagonist, but adaptive shields work great too"

Guy implied that using mobile means you can't view it, he says he was using an iPod and can't view it, I say I can view it, and that I'm using Android. Therefore it is viewable on mobile, but it depends what you use to view it, for me it works, for him it doesn't.

Once past level 30 or so ammo and money are easy to come by and much better guns are available. Any version of the Harold knocks down faster.   I also find The Bee to be crap as well, even with blood soaked shield or the perk that makes DT recharge it. It drops too fast in solo play and you spend more time hiding waiting for a recharge. I find an Antagonist shield to work best for me.   I also prefer blood soaked shield perk over the DT perk. Mainly because the DT perk takes your pet off of Tanking/DPS too often to comes back and heal you.

If you want some specific unique to advance just take it and use it for 2 or 3 digistruct peak runs and then you can easily get a new one if you want it.

Throughout most of the game I can one shot badasses with this thing (if slagged in UVHM, still true). Once you learn how to aim the thing (jump up and aim downward and towards your enemy) it's really a Godsend. Just keep in mind that it has a MASSIVE blast radius, so even if it goes a ways above the enemies' heads it will still destroy them. The only flaw with this is that if you aim just a bit off and it comes back to explode on you then you will be sent into fight for your life.

Go down Survival for, well, survival, Gunpowder for DPS, and finally Guerrilla for a more jack of all trades kind of playstyle (skip Laser Sight though, it's crap).  Note: damage dealt by most Torgue weapons, Maliwan pistols and Tediore reloads count as grenade damage and will thus be boosted by Steady and Do or Die, so if you like blowing things up then Gunpowder is the tree for you. Here's the build I used on my primary Axton at 36, if that helps (looking back I probably should've gone for Expertise instead of Ranger but whatever)."

Once his shields are down don't use a fire or corrosive weapon as he's immune. Explosive works well here so a DPUH is great unless you've really spec'd into anarchy and running 300+ stacks.

I think his skill trees really work well together and he can make use of alot of gear that other characters really cant use well.  You can also tear through maps with flacker swapping due to his expertise skill if you just want to get from place to place.  I would say play Gaige, Axton and Zer0.  They are all really different.  I would stick with zer0 in any case.  His melee mechanic transcends gaming.  If you see some of the really good melee players out there, its like an art form."

Borderlands2,3brbhd,garpunkal,2,Wed Jul 1 14:57:30 2015 UTC,"I've got a gtx 960 4gb and almost always run the game at 180+fps. This is with foliage distance on medium and view distance in medium and physX turned off, and lastly black outlines turned off (personal preference) everything else is maxed. Sometimes I do dip below 60 fps but this is very brief and only happens in super intense battles with a lot going on. You can turn physX on and black outlines on as I used to, however I find that maintaining a smooth 60 is a lot harder with those two settings on. A bonus to the black outlines off is a MUCH higher and smoother fps and the game looks nicer to me.  TLDR: game is not the most well optimised but with view and foliage distance set to medium( can probably turn high if you really want), physX low (which can be good due to some loot clipping through the floor with physX on high) and black lines off (not cell shading as well, also provides a huge fps boost and looks really good) you can easily achieve 180-350fps depending on area. I would also recommend just tweaking the games options and finding what works best for YOU. Good luck and happy looting!"

I never use Kriegs ability until he has low enough health to go into release the beast, and as soon as he comes out of it, wait until his health is low again and repeat. I always pick up a class mod that gives bonus points to silence the voices since the melee boost is ridiculous.

Start a new character on the same profile and get them to sanctuary then using a second controller login with the character you want to open the chest you will see that that character has one key use that key to open the chest now the 2nd player will have zero keys while the first player has one exit the second player and rejoin as that player you will see that the key that you spent is back and you can use it again repeat this process for infinite at level loot (this is only for console gamers if you are on pc then you just have to stick with the legit codes or a save editor)

Borderlands2,3boe20,serkythedude,3,Tue Jun 30 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"The pipe on the left hand side as you exit the arena can block Hyperius' novas if you stand behind them, so that could be worth trying. There is also a glitch where you can make hyperius' bots spawn without Hyperius himself being agro'd by running into the arena, shooting hyperius and as he get his life bar run in the building and back out quickly. His bots should spawn allowing you to injure them so you can quickly finish them off in the fight. (Note: do not kill the bots and only stand by the gate entrance or the bots will shoot you). Lastly there is a glitch spot that requires some work to get to, search Joltzdude for help with that. Good Luck!"
Borderlands2,3boe20,FrootiousLoopious,0,Wed Jul 1 03:00:10 2015 UTC,"Google either admiral bahroo raiding guide for Axton and you should find a hyperius on easily. Joltzdude also has a guide that uses Tediore reloads which is pretty powerful as well.  Or you could delete commando, and get a gunzerker as Axton is terrible at raiding whip Salvador is very very good at it."

Don't worry about leveling or searching for legendaries until you get through TVHM (2nd play through of the main story). Those will happen organically while you are playing the game and its really not worth your time since you will be leveling pretty fast. Time your completion of your second play through so that you are right around level 50 and jump into UVHM (3rd play through). Please take some time to google/read about UVHM strategies before you jump in. It's a different game from that point forward."

Borderlands2,3bm7qc,Add32,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"Im in the same place, middle tree is definitely a good tree to be in.  You need to find automatic weapons to make use of the capstone. (must be continuously holding trigger)  What i found useful was tackling some of the dlc after i got into TVHM, it helped find me some decent leveled  guns that the enemies just didn't want to drop for me.  If you wanted to do something interesting you might take half left tree and half middle tree, getting 'down but not out' to help yourself get back up.  (this is my first Sal play thorough also, and my furthest character at level 42)"

I'd assume in that case you would still need the first UVHUP for 11 levels. If you didn't get it (and the 2nd pack instead raised your level cap to 61) you would miss out on most of the features of the 2nd pack, such as the legendary class mods (dropped from level 62+ from Chubby/Tubby enemies), new pearlescents, and the Raid on Digistruct Peak Overpower levels."

Reload the CP and continue.   Had WTF drop twice and a legendary grenade. PLUS the boss in the area dropped the Nukem Launcher (forget the bosses name).

Just run from the fast travel to the final building before Mothrakk, killing and opening everything along the way (save and quit once you've cleared out the entrance to that building). I'd estimate there's at least 1 Tubby per 5 runs, and on average 2 LLMs outside the guaranteed ones. If you're good, the whole run takes maybe 10-15 minutes."

One second he was there, and then I turned around and he wasn't.  I'm sure I didn't kill it.   He just kinda... left.   Ran around the general area looking for it but couldn't find it.

The textures taking awhile to load in is normal, there's no way around it  unfortunately :/. Your game crashing could be for a number of reasons. Make sure your antivirus or any other intensive programs aren't running in the background. Also, as the others commenter said, validating your game through steam could fix your issue. My guess as to why you lost some xp is that your game hadn't saved for a while before it crashed. When you loaded the game back up, your most recent save may have been 15 or so minutes before your crash. Honestly I have no idea what is causing the gunfire problem. The solution to the framerate drops is easy! Just turn down PhysX. Take it down one notch at a time and test it for about 10 minutes to see what your rig can handle. I hope this helps fix at least a few of your problems!"

Krieg's only real raid/UVHM weakness is that he can't apply slag when he's alone.  Krieg tears through most bosses like skag claws through wet flannel. If you're solo raiding, your goal is to duck and weave and land blows in the spaces between attacks. Don't be afraid to strafe and throw axes while you wait for your ult to time down so you can RtB all over again.  If you're in a team, you're cleanup crew. Rage around and cover your allies whenever there's a swarm stage by killing the little shits and splashing Bloodsplosion damage onto the main boss. When it gets back into single boss stages, flank your opponent while a Sal/Axton/Gaige draws fire and axe him in the back."

Borderlands2,3bh5by,FiresStream,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:10:36 2015 UTC,"Gaige isn't exactly the best team player in the sense that her support options are limited compared to Maya, or even Axton / Krieg. The most she has to offer is Buck Up, which is the shield-restoring skill you mentioned, but there are scenarios where restoring an ally's shield can be bad for them, notably when you're playing with a Mania or Hellborn Krieg, or a melee Zer0.  Your best all-around ""support"" option is Interspersed Outburst in the middle tree, which acts as a source of free slag. This will require you to spec heavily into the middle tree, though, and most players don't do this.  This is a ""typical"" end-game build for Gaige, focusing heavily on Anarchy. It's not very team-oriented, nor should it be - your teammates should be looking to protect you, as you run around with 400 Anarchy killing everything in sight."

Zero can slag/death mark, which is normal for solo play as well  Sal can put on a hoarder com which nerfs his damage output considerably.   Krieg can get instant res, which is not all that worth it since it downs him instead.   Axton and Gaige have summons that act as distractions (aggro)   Your best bet for co-op is to play her as if you're alone. Anarchy + blood soaked shields for damage and survivability, DT for aggro"

Borderlands2,3bd1or,kilkil,3,Sun Jun 28 01:48:12 2015 UTC,"To one of the last bits, once you reach UVHM there really isn't a point to farming TVHM for loot. The difference between a level 52 and a level 51 item will increase massively (for instance, the current legendaries I had ~2-3 levels below me are literally useless now) in UVHM, and the max level items you can get from TVHM is 50. If you need new gear, farming it in UVHM is the best way to go.  For a small add on, explosives in UVHM get a massive increase (6x damage if I remember), and Slag both stays on a target longer and amplifies damage more."

Borderlands2,3bd1or,munchyBanana,3,Tue Jun 30 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"I suggest not going back to TVHM to farm, then you will end up with underleveled gear. Enemies scale to your level in UVHM, but guns will be at maximum level 50 from TVHM, so you could be potentially facing level 54 (your level + 2) with level 50 guns. Your gear seems pretty good, but if you're focusing sniper rifles, you'll want to pick up a high damage sniper rifle. For now the Jakobs assault rifle will work, they have relatively high base damage. You might want to pick up a transfusion grenade with a low fuse time if you don't already have one, the healing will be useful because Zer0 sometimes struggles with health in sticky situations.  For strategy I suggest slagging enemies, then switching to your Gatling Gun/Ravager depending on how far they are from you. The way slag works in UVHM doesn't give as much damage bonus to slag damage on slagged enemies vs other damage on slagged enemies, so your non-Railer guns will be more effective.  I suggest a build like this: http://bl2skills.com/assassin.html#505051000050055105415000000000 With only one sniper rifle, whose main utility is slagging, Critical Ascensi0n is not going to be that effective against enemies. Fast Hands is a great all-around skill to have, especially if you're going to slag and swag. Ambush is amazing coming out of Deception, as the damage bonus applies to enemies targeting your decoy. Rising Sh0t is a good skill to have, as your Jakobs assault rifle can quickly build Rising Sh0t stacks. It seems you like some health regeneration, and Innervate can get you a little health back while in Deception. Tw0 Fang is a nice passive skill to have in any situation, as it increases you DPS. Death Bl0ss0m and Death Mark synergize extremely well together, as while in Deception, shooting kunai at an enemy will apply Death Mark, granting you 20% damage. Headsh0t is a useful skill, because it lets you tear through enemies if you're scoring critical hits. Killer is really nice because it lets you keep your momentum up, chaining kills together. 0ne Sh0t 0ne Kill is a great skill for shooting an enemy coming out of Deception, the extra full magazine damage added onto Deception's extra damage is enough to one-hit most common enemies. B0re is nice, because Deception lets you sneak around and line up nice sightlines, for b0ring multiple enemies. I'm a big fan of Killing Bl0w even when I don't spec into a melee build, its a really nice skill to be able to one shot enemies once they fall below 20% health.  Looking forward, if you want to focus on using sniper rifles, I would try to grab any powerful ones you come along. Near the beginning of the game, Hammerlock gives a nice Jakobs sniper rifle as a quest reward for Bad Hair Day in Liar's Berg. Kill C0nfirmed is not a very good skill, I would try to use any future skill points to spec into Vel0city and At 0ne With the Gun, they will provide more use to you."
Borderlands2,3bd1or,Bithur,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:07:22 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks a lot! Now that you mention it, most of the Sniping tree beyond B0re doesn't really do much for me. Although, I'm not really sure about Tw0 Fang; it seems like it would be nice with SMGs and all, but wouldn't it just be a waste of ammo on sniper rifles and shotguns?  The Transfusion thing definitely seems like a good idea -- I'm sure I have a Corrosive Kiss of Death somewhere that ends up dealing around 80,000 damage overall. Although, Zer0's health problems are pretty much the whole reason I'm sticking with my Survivor COM.  Aside from generally just using slag more, is there anything else I should consider for UVHM that I don't really need to worry about for Normal Mode and TVHM? Also, do the drops get better? I want better drops.  Again, thanks for your reply. This helped a lot."
Borderlands2,3bd1or,Bithur,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:33:12 2015 UTC,"I don't play sniper a lot (reached lvl 50 only), but i do play borderlands a lot. The one thing that makes UVHM easy (or hard if you do it wrong) is how you approach areas, and how you plan your way through it.  In TVHM, a good game plan would look like : run into everything, kill things and battle through FFYL, then you're done.  in UVHM (or more specifically OP lvls), this won't work... you need to watch first where you want to bring the battle. Getting more experienced at this will make it easy up to OP5-6. I found having one croud control ability helps tremendously (something like implosion slag grenades) these things give you time to relocate to a safer spot (or give you time to rip the to shreds)  If you want more loots, Captain Scarlet is about 2hours for a full clear and loots a lot at first (so many chests). The expansion is pretty easy when compared to tina tina (much harder minions and much longer expansion with arguably less loot within one run)."

Borderlands2,3bd1or,oi-__-io,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:05:00 2015 UTC,Most maps follow patterns that you'll start to recognize sooner or later.

Things like that.

Borderlands2,3b7t1h,JeromeWiggins,3,Fri Jun 26 17:42:12 2015 UTC,I have a related question. If you have two monitors can you play split screen one game on each monitor?
Borderlands2,3b7t1h,smartbycomparison,2,Sat Jun 27 00:03:20 2015 UTC,That's what I'd been doing with the tool I mentioned. The tool was required to launch two instances of the game on one PC because Steam normally doesn't allow that.
Borderlands2,3b7t1h,R4gi3X,3,Sat Jun 27 00:15:35 2015 UTC,"Even though you can't open two instances directly through steam you still have the option to go to your steam folder, go to Borderlands and Start the Borderlands.exe from there for a second instance of the Game ( alrady used this a few times to powerlevel a few characters) but I am not sure if You can have the two games run splitscreen-like."
Borderlands2,3b7t1h,altSHIFTT,3,Sat Jun 27 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yes there is, I think it's called split tool or something, makes it super easy, you can use two monitors, split monitors into 2, 3, 4, whatever.

Borderlands2,3b8uk6,SeattleResident,3,Fri Jun 26 22:26:02 2015 UTC,"This is what I found on steam - it seems it has to do with barrel type and not necessarily the prefix. I have the ""refactored"" fibber with the ricocheting pattern that people use with Gaige.  ""The best fibber has the type 3 barrel (ricocheting/flower pattern spread). It show the highest amount of damage of the three barrel types. The worst is the shotgun type. in the middle is the crit damage fibber.   To tell the three types: the ricocheting will always have the highest damage. 111111 damage for example. Bullets split into 9 projectiles after ricocheting.  the shotgun fibber will always have a x1 damage. 5555x1 damage for example. Fires a Slow moving projectile with a shotgun like spread.  the crit fibber will always have the lowest damage . 1111 damage for expamle. Bullets leave a trail in the air when bouncing off of something."""
Borderlands2,3b8uk6,miss_moxxie,2,Fri Jun 26 22:55:44 2015 UTC,Yeah the main thing is the prefix that I am worried about. I know the ricochet barrel is the best but I see people that swear by a non redundant version of the ricocheting barrel and then other people that say you need the redundant version of the ricocheting barrel to maximize damage.   Since I am farming the best possible I am just curious which version of the ricocheting barrel is the best.
Borderlands2,3b8uk6,miss_moxxie,2,Fri Jun 26 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"Ah sorry I misunderstood a bit.  It looks like the redundant is definitely the best prefix in terms of getting the most damage. Some people online say that even the redundant version can have a shitty barrel,  which means you need to farm until you get redundant and a ricochet barrel.  And now it looks like a need a new fibber myself haha :p"
Borderlands2,3b8uk6,goatface_steve,2,Fri Jun 26 23:12:24 2015 UTC,"The reason most people like the Redundant is bc it shoots 2 bullets out at a time, so after ricocheting, you will get 18 projectiles shooting out and redirecting toward enemies if you are specced into Close Enough. However, if you are looking for an elemental version of a ricocheting Fibber, it can take quite a long time to find a Redundant elemental that you like. I'm using an OP2 Energizing Ricochet Fibber that works just as well as."
Borderlands2,3b7vfj,Alumio24,12,Fri Jun 26 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"I guess you are now playing True Vault Hunter Mode (TVHM), after you beat TVHM you will unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM). The max level is 72, but after you attain this level, you can play a special repeatable mission  known as ""The Raid of Digistruck Peak"", each time you beat this mission you will be able to rise OP until a maximum of 8. Playing at any OP level will give you rewards for missions according to your OP level and loot will be according to your OP level."
Borderlands2,3b7vfj,Big_Babousa,4,Fri Jun 26 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"To add, if you want to attain mission rewarded items, you will have to start over uvhm after completing the op8 raid. That is unless the missions were saved through uvhm until op8 was completed. Point being, you can restart uvhm as many times as you want and get mission rewards for any level."
Borderlands2,3b7vfj,mattt9,2,Fri Jun 26 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"When you restart UVHM, do you lose the OP levels you just gained?"
Borderlands2,3b7vfj,cybersteel8,2,Fri Jun 26 20:37:02 2015 UTC,No once you gain an op level you have the choice to play at that level or any op level below it whenever you start your game up again. If you have op8 unlocked you can choose to play op0 from the main menu for example. Op levels do not reset though so you can always go back to op8 or whatever even if you decide to play a lower one for some time.
Borderlands2,3b7vfj,mattt9,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:14:53 2015 UTC,"To add, I found that good level 72 gear can get me through op3/4 before farming new gear. I wouldn't worry about farming evertything until you complete op8. Just farm for the main gear that you use. Found it takes about 30 minutes to farm sandhawks from reset it you do a op0 run through. Elemental bee shields help out to do lots of damage quickly. Also llm farming is a good way to get lots of legendaries and relics quickly."
Borderlands2,3b7vfj,Mk2Guru,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"What /u/Big_Babousa said is perfectly correct about op levels, but when you see people with all op8 mission weapons and reward weapons they're normally just gibbed, because it would take a REALLY long time to farm"

Yes, but the majority of it was farmed or encountered by luck. I do recommend, instead of farming a lot when you are at OP 8, just start a new character, if you have a lot of OP 8 characters is more probable, one of them would find something useful for one of the characters."

Borderlands2,3b8hy0,basefibber,2,Fri Jun 26 21:03:54 2015 UTC,"I would agree with basefibber about waiting, but I often find myself underleveled in TVHM with leaving sidequests/DLC until after I beat the Warrior.  I usually run through Captain Scarlett's DLC (can usually level up 3 times there) and while you get some stuff that would be nice to have at 50, it doesn't take long to redo it at the beginning of UVHM. Usually don't touch the other DLC's though until UVHM."
Borderlands2,3b8hy0,here4payne,2,Fri Jun 26 23:10:12 2015 UTC,"For me, scarlett has the most weapons I want going into uvhm. But I agree, I usually run tinas or torgue when I get under leveled in the main campaign.  The best part is you can stop and continue them any time and they level with you ( on a quest by quest basis)    For anyone else,  take a look at quest rewards of dlcs because you may want some at 50 more than others!"
Borderlands2,3b4ouj,FireHS,5,Thu Jun 25 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"For Krieg, earlygame you'll be pretty squishy and kinda eh damage wise. It sounds like you are going Mania, so you'll want Feed the Meat and Empty the Rage as fast as possible (Meat gives you health which you'll need to survive, and Rage is great melee damage). If you are in coop, consider skipping Fuel the Rampage (unless you REALLY trust your partner), but otherwise it is a great skill to have early as it gives you much more rampages. Once you have these Buzz Axe Rampage is off cooldown when you need it, and you can use the built in health regen on kill to kill most enemies.  For quests, the Incinerator Clayton questline gives an amazing shield for Krieg, and any bladed (+50% melee damage) gun will help you greatly."
Borderlands2,3b4ouj,Lord_Dust_Bunny,2,Thu Jun 25 23:38:02 2015 UTC,Kriegs buzz axe does more damage then +50% melee weapons unless you have roid.
Borderlands2,3b4ouj,NeoZenith1,3,Fri Jun 26 01:16:13 2015 UTC,"Not earlygame, which is where he/she is at. It's ~45 where Krieg's innate melee bonus out performs the 50% melee, and since OP is at 12 I didn't consider it worth mentioning."
Borderlands2,3b4ouj,Lord_Dust_Bunny,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:22:18 2015 UTC,True because stv is like level 25.
Borderlands2,3b4ouj,NeoZenith1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Siren's ability (mostly) negates Rampage's debuff. It's good fun.  Can't be bothered checking but I assume Rampage is the skill that allows Krieg to take damage from other players' attacks.  It works so well with Siren's Restoration ability. I'm playing Siren with a friend as Mania Krieg, and the only thing that deals damage (as far as I remember) is grenades. Krieg still gets the buffs from Rampage but almost no downside. It's so much fun hitting him with Moxxi's rocket to heal him to max health in one shot.  Insta-EDIT: My long-winded point being if you have a Harmony Siren then Rampage all the way. Yeah, 10/10 contribution"
Borderlands2,3b4ouj,Crimson065,6,Fri Jun 26 10:31:34 2015 UTC,"I can also highly recommend the Siren, elemental damage and phaselock is really fun"

Borderlands2,3b4ouj,Vhalantru,2,Fri Jun 26 01:45:48 2015 UTC,"Easier to be effective with Zer0 than Krieg as a new player, however. I started on Zer0 and it remains one of the funner classes to play."
Borderlands2,3b4ouj,CaptHunter,2,Fri Jun 26 10:25:43 2015 UTC,"If you like sniping and/or Melee. You'll love zer0 he is a really fun character to play as. Plus there are raid bosses that can be soloed by zer0 easily using almost any gun in the game b0re really makes short work of hyperious and the bunk3r. It's really op and their is also critical assention. Zer0 is a character that, by personal experience gets really fun later on in the game."

Borderlands2,3b4ouj,dmft91,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:00:13 2015 UTC,"Melee Krieg has good dps and he is really tanky and survivable. He is a character that just goes close to enimes and continously wack people (mania tree). Melee zero is much more challenging to play imo espicially at high levels. He does High amounts of burst dmg. With good gear you can easily 1 shot ultimate badasses. However both of these classes have the same problem, they need their skill caps to be good. Anything before ""many must fall"" or ""release the beast"" is quite lack luster.  In your first playthrough with krieg just get any roid shield and run at people. Your hp bar refills to full when you kill something, the way to staying alive is constantly killin people."

I sometimes pull out my sniper to pop an enemy or two from range, Metal Gear Solid my way into the group, and then just smash em to bits.  As someone who loves playing Krieg, I find that having fun is superior to efficiency... but a Melee Krieg can have the best of both, fun AND efficiency.  If you can fit into the mindset of meaning a genocidal lunatic who loves shouting about meat and fluids as he rips gorillas in half, you'll have fun with him.  From there... it is just about finding ways to stay alive and better kill. Silence the Voices and Release the Beast are very good for this."

Borderlands2,3b4364,chrisepoc,8,Thu Jun 25 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can't Firehawk Saturn.  Switch to an Adaptive, if you have one.  Saturn is immune to all status effects, which makes it difficult for you to ignite and activate your Hellborn bonuses.  The first self-ignition you can easily get from the skag pup in the yard.  After the skag pup is dead, use a fire weapon on Saturn's turrets (which are susceptible to status effects) to ignite one of them.  Here you really do want to use fire against an armored target, because you don't necessarily want to destroy the turret immediately.  If you do destroy the turret, just ignite another... but you can only do this a few times.  Once you're aflame and have all your bonuses, switch to a corrosive weapon and hose Saturn down with acid.  Don't worry about the elemental effect chance or damage of your weapon: just focus on listed gun damage and rate of fire.  A fast-firing assault rifle is good here.  Try to avoid corroding the turrets accidentally unless you think you can stay alit long enough to destroy Saturn in one pass.  Explosives do work against Saturn, but they destroy its turrets too quickly for my preference.  If you think you can do the job without any of your Hellborn ignition bonuses, then by all means Torgue it into scrap.  Otherwise, put away that Harold.  Alternately, you really can use Mania here.  Roid shield is best here.  I call this tactic the Psycho Chihuahua.  Charge Saturn and go into ankle-biter mode until he knocks down your shield with a stomp and health-gates you.  Then Release The Beast and get a few more Roid-enhanced buzzaxe swings in, until you start taking damage again.  Run away behind the motel and recover from Rampage.  Repeat."
Borderlands2,3b4364,Daemmerung,5,Thu Jun 25 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"Adding on to this, if you go Mania you can get low, Release the Beast, and then just leave cover to throw buzzaxes until you need to hide from his counter attack and repeat. It'll be pretty boring, but it is relatively safe and easy."

Borderlands2,3b4364,Zaaptastic,2,Thu Jun 25 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"The easiest way, imo, is to spec into Bloodsplosion, get one of this mini-turrets low, then smack it with the best rocket launcher you have/roid shield boosted explosive buzzaxe. Saturn is not affected by slag, but I'm unsure if his turrets are. If his turrets can be slagged, then of course it is worthwhile to slag the one you intend to kill before setting off the Bloodsplosion chain (the slag effect is passed on).  Assuming all the other turrets on him are alive, the resulting Bloodsplosion should be enough to severely dent if not outright kill Saturn.  Similar to this video"
Borderlands2,3b4364,Daemmerung,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:26:00 2015 UTC,"Saturn's turrets can be slagged.  There's no ""passing on"" of the slagged effect, however, unless you destroy the turret with a slag shot proper, in which case its Bloodsplosion would be slag-elemental.  Otherwise you'd need to slag each turret explicitly.  That video destroys Saturn with a thrown Corrosive Fastball amplified by Fuel the Blood (proc'd by the melee kill of the skag pup), with the splosion rolling across Slagga-slagged turrets.  Nifty.  Had to go back and confirm that it was at OP8."
Borderlands2,3b4364,Zaaptastic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:38:40 2015 UTC,"This guy is absolutely correct. Slagging the turrets does not spread the slag effect unless the novas are also slag. I disremembered facts. In this case, you indeed want to try to slag all the turrets for maximum damage.  However, this being TVHM and not UVHM or OP levels, slag might not even be necessary if you use a strong enough single-shot weapon (eg. rocket launcher, although as you can see from the video a strong grenade also works).  The video was indeed OP8. You can tell because the level of the Pup Skag (I believe it always spawns at level 80 on OP8?), unless I am again mistaken. In any case, OP is asking for advice on TVHM, so a lot of the min-maxing done is completely overkill (excuse the pun)."

Also, don't know if this is helpful to you but I'll mention it as I didn't realise this for 3 or 4 playthroughs: you dont actually have to kill Saturn to complete the mission. If you're really stuck on him, you can run past him to the elevator.

They have an increased chance to drop legendaries on UVHM but can drop legendaries at any difficulty level.  They will not drop e-tech relics or pearls until UVHM though.

Borderlands2,3b3tty,8988303682,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:14:55 2015 UTC,So the only thing that rubi has going for it is weapon damage which I do not need thanks for the help :)
Borderlands2,3b3tty,Curryriceandpeas,0,Thu Jun 25 19:46:19 2015 UTC,It's the drunk effect.
Borderlands2,3b3tty,ScootaLewis,5,Fri Jun 26 04:03:37 2015 UTC,The grog slags with a nearly 50% chance compared to 15-20% on Rubi. Grog heals for 65% of any damage you deal instead of Rubi's 12%. Grog is better in every important way.
Borderlands2,3b3tty,ScootaLewis,3,Thu Jun 25 19:26:53 2015 UTC,Really: 65% I thought it was far less as the borderlands wiki said that rubi has the highest health return in all moxxi weapons with percentage of 12 vs 0.02-5
Borderlands2,3b3tty,m1k3too,5,Thu Jun 25 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"The wiki isn't always right. There are people who have fought time and again to try and change some information that is actually incorrect, but the owner of the wiki refuses to let it be corrected."
Borderlands2,3b3tty,ilovecheese2,0,Thu Jun 25 19:53:57 2015 UTC,"I think the Slow Hand has the highest potential for health regen out of Moxxis gear actually (pretty sure I read that on the wiki) but that may be dependent on outside factors, and I may be remembering wrong. I prefer the Rubi to the Grog but I'm in the minority on that one."
Borderlands2,3b3tty,m1k3too,3,Thu Jun 25 19:58:21 2015 UTC,Nope. The grog nozzle has the highest healing percentage. No other moxxi gun matches it's 65%.  Throw a chain lightning with a grog in hand and get all of your health back
Borderlands2,3b3tty,bgugi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:53:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's been a while since I read up on everything, I thought I may have been wrong and I haven't used either gun in a long time. I can throw a Storm Front with a Rubi or Kitten equipped and get all my health so I don't use the Grog. I run Zer0 with a health regen class mod so I don't rely much on Moxxis stuff."
Borderlands2,3b3tty,iammyusername,3,Fri Jun 26 01:05:56 2015 UTC,also of importance: grog nozzle will occasionally give you a HUMONGOUS damage boost if used strategically.
Borderlands2,3b3tty,artemisdragmire,3,Thu Jun 25 22:13:41 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate?
Borderlands2,3b3tty,Trevoroo,2,Thu Jun 25 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"Every so often while holding the grog nozzle it will ""proc"" and your screen will start swaying slightly and your aim reticule will baloon.  When this happens, the next shot fired from ANY weapon will fire something like 6 or 8x the normal amount of pellets, but in a very inaccurate fashion.  With certain weapons (Unkempt Harold is a good example) this can be devastating."
Borderlands2,3b3tty,artemisdragmire,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:59:00 2015 UTC,The drunk effect works very well if you are raidbossing with anarchy gaige with a bone of the ancients relic and norfleet with 600 anarchy stacks you can 1 shot raidbosses. You have to be at point blank range though.

This is a problem for me, as I like to explore and find things, not just half-ass speed-run the game. So if you pick it up for PS4, I'm always happy to have a new co-op partner."

Borderlands2,3ayi4i,cordell507,3,Wed Jun 24 16:27:00 2015 UTC,It is fairly easy at lower levels. Quite frankly I think people become jaded to co-op after doing it for a while at lower levels because there always seems to be assholes that will drop in on you and then make off with every good thing that drops and then log out.

Borderlands2,3azrit,bigtruck2984,2,Wed Jun 24 20:33:58 2015 UTC,It was done by using splitscreen multiplayer. The second character is signed in using the guest account which comes up as x(1) in online multiplayer. Moonshot farming is done in this way and yes it should allow powerleveling. I am not sure if it will allow BAR manipulation but I do not see why it wouldn't.
Borderlands2,3azohz,Slyzavh,2,Wed Jun 24 20:10:59 2015 UTC,Are you using a grog nozzle for health regen? Grog nozzle phaselock immediately after the initial hit to regen your health above healthgate is probably a good start.
Borderlands2,3azohz,_darkwingduck_,2,Wed Jun 24 23:58:07 2015 UTC,"Having a nurse class mod, prefer legendary, helps with health, and if you can get a grounded bee shield it will survive better against those blast but it will still be taken down. And having a friend or two will help cause soloing that is annoying as all sin."
Borderlands2,3azohz,Jake3099,2,Thu Jun 25 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"With Maya it was incredibly easy for me, honestly.  Those little midgets (or various other minions) will spawn and as long as you have a Pimp, just phaselock one midget, unload a clip on Dukino's mom, and use the rock as cover/keep taking her around it.  If Chain Reaction kicks in for you, you should have no issue taking her out."
Borderlands2,3aznta,dwimber,2,Wed Jun 24 20:06:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much you know about BL2, so I'm going to keep this spoiler-free.  The last story boss in the game drops a pretty hefty amount of Eridium every time you kill it, and the fight isn't that hard either.  If you're capable of quickly soloing raid bosses, the raid boss fight at the end of the 4th DLC (Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep) nets you around 70 Eridium each run.  Neither of these examples scale with your level until you hit UVHM."

Borderlands2,3aznta,45sfCA,2,Wed Jun 24 20:37:54 2015 UTC,The four dragons drop close to 100 bars. If you wait until your well into uvhm you can fill out all of your eridum upgrades in an hour or two.

Borderlands2,3aznta,Gad1997,2,Wed Jun 24 23:05:15 2015 UTC,No. In the castle you can enter a room by paying 20 eridum. Once in you can summon 4 elemental dragons.  Kill them pick up all the loot.  Quit load repeat.

Borderlands2,3auzdk,ShinkuTear,3,Tue Jun 23 21:46:34 2015 UTC,"Saying 1 isn't as good as 2, is like saying a game worthy of 8.5 isn't as good as a 9.0 or 9.5.

Borderlands2,3auycx,Guava_,2,Wed Jun 24 03:42:14 2015 UTC,The fire rate is so much better than the gun you are holding! Think of the DPS!
Borderlands2,3auycx,45sfCA,2,Wed Jun 24 04:00:37 2015 UTC,"5x the Fire Rate, about 59% the Damage per shot, but fires only 1 shot each time it fires, compared to the 14 of the DPUH.  If my math is even close to correct, this leads to 21% the DPS of the DPUH, assuming all shots hit. That Infinity has the advantage of better Accuracy and its shots not fanning out, but I have NO idea how to factor that into damage output.  Definitely comparable DPS when you factor the superior accuracy, and for Salvador it also destroys any odds of running out of ammo on either your main gun or your Grog/Rubi."
Borderlands2,3auycx,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:47:05 2015 UTC,"this  It's like saying a jakobs pistol is better than a shotgun because it does more damage.

Borderlands2,3auycx,45sfCA,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:32:56 2015 UTC,well...its the amount of bullets that hit that counts. I love the DPUH but I will switch to an infinity when the time is right. An infinity will out perform a DPUH at a long distance every time.
Borderlands2,3auycx,Guava_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the DPS on the Infinity is rather low for a Vladof pistol and you would be far more effective running a Garnet Anarchist of equal level."

Borderlands2,3aus2p,SlamHouseLoL,7,Tue Jun 23 23:36:53 2015 UTC,Would anyone mind telling me what is actually going on in that video? I couldn't tell which skills were giving you that crazy damage.
Borderlands2,3aus2p,GQwerty07,14,Tue Jun 23 18:51:15 2015 UTC,"It's not the fire rate.  As you can see, it didn't even take me 1 clip to kill him.  It's a combination of the Pimpernel and one of Maya's skills: ""Chain Reaction"", plus a COM that adds to Chain Reaction.  When someone is phase locked, every shot that hits an enemy has a chance to ricochet and hit another enemy.  The pimpernel has pellets that ""splash off"" of it when it hits an enemy, so it's like getting 6 bullets for the price of one.  Add that on to chain reaction and you've got so many shots that it's not even funny.  There are a bunch of videos/info on Google about how exactly it works, and they do a much better job of explaining than I do."
Borderlands2,3aus2p,johnchapel,2,Tue Jun 23 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"Here, I went back and did it again and highlighted the certain skill I was talking about: ""Chain Reaction"".  A lot of people say Maya sucks for raids and stuff like that and while they're not wrong, they're not completely right.  Honestly, as long as there are little ""minions"" to phaselock and as long as you have the right elemental weapon, she can be pretty decent.  She excels at team play and crowd control though, so while she might not be the best character for raids (<5% of total enemies in game), she's probably the best for everything else.  Here's the video: CR + Pimp + BT  Probably would've killed him if I stopped after 1 shot.  And I got a bit retarded with the bots because I couldn't find their sweet spots AND I don't have an elemental Bitch (which is what I'm farming for).  So yeah...  Edit: and like I said, it's not fire rate.  It's just the exponential amount of growing pellets and the damage they cause.  If you pause it at the right time, you can see one hit marker of ~350,000,000.  In the other video there's a hit marker of over 400,000,000.  I'd venture to say that some of the hit markers that don't even show up probably go up higher than that."

Borderlands2,3aus2p,HanzsKlopek,5,Tue Jun 23 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's a skill called kinetic reflection? Where when you have something phaselocked, your bullets have a chance to ricochet and hit another enemy. That paired with this gun and the class mod is basically creating pellets inside of the bunker at an increasing exponential rate."

Borderlands2,3artdq,Tycoon33,5,Tue Jun 23 02:20:41 2015 UTC,I was very disappointed with Lootcrate. Stuck around for 3 crates and everything I received was garbage.

Borderlands2,3augfa,Nby36,3,Tue Jun 23 16:33:55 2015 UTC,It is RNG. The drops have been increased as a hotfix. An internet connection is needed for this to apply. Remember the rates are still less than 1/10 though so it is not that strange to get nothing without farming.

Borderlands2,3av6tf,CoolEv1,12,Tue Jun 23 19:38:21 2015 UTC,No. She is not the kind of character to go out hunting vaults. We need new characters.
Borderlands2,3av6tf,8988303682,5,Tue Jun 23 19:44:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Moxxi is no vault hunter.  Her love for violence and fame comes with the Underdome.  Moxxi doesn't chase her goals, she makes them come to her ;)"
Borderlands2,3av6tf,Sparrow626,2,Tue Jun 23 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it will be all new characters.  I think every character that we've already met in the game has had the vault hunters do missions for them.  If the character was so skilled, why wouldn't they have just taken care of the mission themselves.  For example, if Marcus had the skills to be a playable character, he would have collected his stash of Moxxi pics himself and not taken the risk of the vault hunter giving them to Moxxi.  The game would have to retcon some reason for that character to be awesome now when they used to suck.  The did the reverse of that with Claptrap in a way that made sense.  But I think to dip in to that well too many times would end up making the story too convoluted."

Borderlands2,3at40e,AlbertMyers,3,Tue Jun 23 08:11:15 2015 UTC,"I'm busy doing a playthrough as Maya, and I'm really loving her playstyle. In the early game I felt as if she was a little weak and died a fair bit due to no real big health regen until later on in the skill trees, however by level 50+ she was kicking ass and I now almost never die. As far as sniping goes for maya, there are some skills that boost crit damage and effect chance, however with maya smg's are the way to go (due to so many rate of fire, effect chance boosters and damage gained from her skills). As for gaige, well I haven't really played with her too much, but she's definitely and interesting character I'd say. It's fun to play around with her anarchy and deathtrap. She's supposed to be really great end game as well. I doubt sniping with gaige is a viable option due to anarchy however. Overall I'd probably pick Maya first to max level."
Borderlands2,3at40e,FrootiousLoopious,2,Tue Jun 23 09:16:15 2015 UTC,"I will always choose Maya. She requires more ""playing"", rather than hopelessly clicking near an enemy and wishing for a bullet to land. Maya is also pretty great at sniping, most people, including I, would rank her 2nd; right after Zer0. While Gaige would most likely be rated pretty low. She has no accuracy, which is mandatory for a good sniper."
Borderlands2,3at40e,8988303682,2,Tue Jun 23 10:59:00 2015 UTC,"I have them both at 72, both are my favourite characters. I found Maya to be easier to play solo, easy to snipe and crit targets when they are phaselocked."
Borderlands2,3at40e,yksteist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:06:50 2015 UTC,"I find Maya's skill a little underpowered since everytime you use it it decreases in duration so after a while it's completely useless (a little like fight for your life?) But I'm not sure because I've only played Maya for a little while (I main zer0, and damn he's badass). I haven't tried Gaige, but most people say she's the most fun to play out of all 6."
Borderlands2,3at40e,everyonelovescake,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"Two of the most fun characters in the game, I don't think you can go wrong with either.  Maya is my favorite, but I fell in love with Gaige first.    If you're playing solo and you want something end-game (as you said), then Gaige is going to be better.  Investing in her right and middle trees make her pretty nasty.  Maya is more team oriented than Gaige, but with the right build, COMs, and weapons, she can almost out DPS anyone.    If you're asking me who is more fun, then I'm going with Maya BUT just barely.  If you're asking me who is probably a little easier, I'm going with Gaige, BUT just barely.  Like I said, you can't go wrong with either of them."

Borderlands2,3aqdg4,Jerdict,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:34:06 2015 UTC,"If youre looking for the easiest character to use in UVHM its easily Sal. Just avoid the Brawn tree. This combo keeps your reload speed, fire rate, and crit damage pretty high, but also pretty much allows you to keep gunzerking forever as long as you kill things.

Ruin and converge slag everything nice and quick  and I just hung back and played conservative with a bee/bitch/pimpernel/plasma caster and everything just died.  I had to refarm a couple of times for a updated bee and bitch and ended up swapping to a lyudia because I wanted to save a new pimp for 72. But yeah it was pretty smooth sailing
Borderlands2,3aqfwz,RaveDigger,3,Mon Jun 22 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"It will likely still be in the low teens, as Savage Lee (like all first playthrough content) does not scale with level."
Borderlands2,3aqfwz,JebusMcAzn,2,Mon Jun 22 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"In the first playthrough, items scale to the enemies' level. So if Savage Lee is level 10, he will remain level 10 throughout the first playthrough, and the items will also remain at the same level.   In the second playthrough, he'll be at a newer, higher level (likely ~35) and his drops will scale to that level. He will remain at this level until you beat the final boss in story mode in playthrough two, at which point he'll scale to level 50, and his items will scale there with him."
Borderlands2,3aqfwz,flavorburst,2,Mon Jun 22 18:21:49 2015 UTC,"If you are playing in normal mode, it will still be a level 10. Enemies do not scale in normal mode. They have a set level and their loot pool is set too."

Borderlands2,3am8gs,Lem0n_ftw,5,Sun Jun 21 16:43:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. Both fantastic games but from a lore perspective BL2 should be played first for maximum enjoyment

Borderlands2,3am8gs,bungunala,-8,Mon Jun 22 00:12:08 2015 UTC,I played TPS as my first BL game and it didn't really spoil anything canon wise. It takes place before 2 anyway...
Borderlands2,3am8gs,_darkwingduck_,14,Sun Jun 21 21:18:05 2015 UTC,Or have many people who have bought TPS gone back to B2 because they got bored or whatever reason.   I have. I've played through BL2 countless times but I didn't even finish the main storyline in TPS because I realized I wasn't having that much fun.   I'm not sure I'd call TPS a bad game but it really didn't click for me.
Borderlands2,3am8gs,thesch,5,Sun Jun 21 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"It's exactly the same for me. I really love BL1 and BL2, so I should also enjoy TPS; but I simply don't :("
Borderlands2,3am8gs,TheTabman,6,Sun Jun 21 19:06:06 2015 UTC,I prefer BL2 because it's a larger game with more things to do and more variety in the environments.
Borderlands2,3am8gs,sin-so-fit,7,Sun Jun 21 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"I was honestly very disappointed by TPS. For me it felt rushed, unfinished; developed strictly by the numbers without any creativity. The Claptrap DLC is nice and the two extra classes are okay, but overall the DLCs are nothing compared to BL2. I doubt I will finish it with more than one class. Though, I should probably not complain too much since I got it for ~25€ with the Season Pass."
Borderlands2,3am8gs,TheTabman,3,Sun Jun 21 19:02:52 2015 UTC,"Having played both quite a bit I would recommend playing them in the order they were released: BL2 first before TPS, and if you can only play one, play BL2.  Folks who are mentioning spoilers and the overall size of BL2 are correct.  Also, I just think BL2 has on balance better writing and characters/skills than TPS."

Borderlands2,3am8gs,RaydenSmash,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:14:32 2015 UTC,I'm playing the pre sequel now. It does feel rather short. I Was already on the third chapter (of 11) before I even got a sniper rifle. It's like the tutorial dragged out for a long time. But the chapters might get bigger as you play through. It's a pretty good game so far. I'd say the characters aren't as interesting as BL2 but I haven't gone through enough of the game to really tell yet.
Borderlands2,3am8gs,Wyatt1313,5,Sun Jun 21 17:34:58 2015 UTC,tutorial for BL2 included a lot of hand holding and being forced to babysit claptrap all the way until the second boss. TPS throws you into the thick of it with a very brief mission to get the Oz kit. In both games you can get a sniper rifle before the second boss in a side quest.
Borderlands2,3am8gs,repapap,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:27:10 2015 UTC,I didn't get one until after deadlift. EVERY gun I found was either a pistol or a rifle. I eventually got one from a side quest but I'm not sure if it was avalable before deadlift quest. I also just recently got a shotgun. Haven't seen any energy weapons yet although I've seen a few bad asses have them. They seem like a good new weapon type.
Borderlands2,3am8gs,Wyatt1313,2,Sun Jun 21 18:56:26 2015 UTC,There is a sniper rifle mission available before Deadlift.
Borderlands2,3am8gs,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:19:23 2015 UTC,There's a sidequest that Janey gives you which is a guaranteed green shock Maliwan sniper rifle. Just like how Hammerlock offers you a guaranteed green Jakobs sniper rifle for another sidequest in BL2.

Borderlands2,3am8gs,Heroish17,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:53:41 2015 UTC,What a stupid gamer tag. You should add some more Xs and a 420 in there since you're so cool.
Borderlands2,3amzer,DaJe5u,5,Sun Jun 21 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"They are both equally powerful builds. For sniper Zer0, most people use the Lyuda and Pimpernel. For grenades, I'd recommend the magic missile since it has 2-4 projectiles and regenerates grenades. There are several shields that suit the sniper build, but I prefer the Sham or Antagonist. For coms, it's your choice between Legendary Sniper and Legendary Hunter. Almost all relics are useable for this build, so use your personal preference. You may also want a Grog/Rubi and a DPUH. If you need help getting any of these items, go to /r/PandoranRedCross"
Borderlands2,3amzer,Maelstrom_Lord,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:46:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight! What should I do now when I can't access all those items you listed? Should I keep going with what I have and try to work my way trough UVHM?
Borderlands2,3amzer,hobowithabazooka,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:33:27 2015 UTC,Vladof and maliwan snipers are very very good. Droog and Snyder are names you want to look out for
Borderlands2,3amzer,whom,-9,Mon Jun 22 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Is sniper Zer0 viable in UVHM...   No.   What are the best level 72 weapons for both sniper and melee Zer0?   No sniper. Slagga, Rapier, DPUH.    What other equipment (relics etc.) should I have?   Bone of the Ancients with the highest cooldown effect you can find,  legendary hunter class mod, whatever shield keeps you alive.  Slagg, switch to Rapier, Deception, Kunai x5, execute, repeat. Finish anything off with the DPUH. I soloed to OP8 doing exactly this."
Borderlands2,3amzer,hobowithabazooka,3,Mon Jun 22 05:05:47 2015 UTC,If you don't know what you're talking about its best not to comment. Sniper zero is plenty able in uvvm

Borderlands2,3amzer,hobowithabazooka,-2,Mon Jun 22 12:34:00 2015 UTC,Doesn't do enough damage. Even with a perfect build you can't one shot anymore. If you're in close quarters or swarmed you're fucked. Every mob has health regen  so by the time you line up your second head shot they've almost back to full health. Zero being the glass tank that he is makes him one of the hardest classes in UVHM. Try it yourself.

Borderlands2,3anaib,Soleil06,2,Sun Jun 21 22:11:25 2015 UTC,"I ha a similar issue as you. Basically, I sold my rubi on PL1, and wanted a level 50 one, so I was unable to heal without using the law+order. Since I wanted a level 50 order as well, I was stuck using a level 25 order the whole play through. The best thing you could do is invest in a grenade (corrosive) so you can damage them early in your deception, than finish them with an execute. It may also help to try to slag bigger enemies (i.e. Badass loaders) before entering deception. It gets a LOT easier once you get the Rubi+Love Thumper (or other roid shield) combo. I'm jealous of your rapier tho, don't have DLC1 yet.  Edit: Dump the melee relic for a proficiency relic btw, melee relics do basically nothing unfortunately. Post your skill tree as well"
Borderlands2,3anaib,RollBills,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"I am currently playing with a Rubi, will try with a proficiency relic. Skilltree is basically most of the melee tree in addition to some skills in the middle tree.  I am currently not at home, and can not say exactly what it is."
Borderlands2,3anaib,RollBills,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:09:54 2015 UTC,"If you have Rubi, then I highly recommend ANY roid shield.

Borderlands2,3anaib,X_POiiSON_X,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:49:28 2015 UTC,I actually just got to level 50 on zer0 using melee. I pretty much used the rapier and a love thumper.
Borderlands2,3anaib,Jack_Ketch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:16:27 2015 UTC,"I rarely melee loaders (mainly because I never looked into more and because I found a solution) because they always killed me.  I know not to melee exploaders but every other time I meleed a loader of any kind it exploded and I died.  I started my Zero as a sniper so I had a Lyuda laying around and two shoots (at its arms/critical areas) and its basically down.  So I snipe loaders and melee humanoids/beasts.  Thats what I did and if you can get your hands on a good sniper rifle (lyuda, pimp, etc) it would help alot."
Borderlands2,3anaib,Big_Babousa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:32:54 2015 UTC,Did you hit on Loaders crit spots? Did you use deception to put yourself behind the Loader?

Borderlands2,3amoj0,crabbman6,2,Sun Jun 21 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"You'll need to just swap it out for a better Roid shield when the time comes. Alternatively you could just hold off until PT2.5 to accept the Love Thumper quest to get one at level 50, but that one will also quickly become irrelevant in UVHM and you'll run into the same issue.  Ultimately it's totally up to you when you want to take your gear - just don't expect to have one unique quest reward last a long time if you're not saving it for the level cap. It's impossible to ""farm"" mission rewards in the way you're thinking, unless you intend to reset UVHM every few levels or so as your Love Thumper gets outleveled.  If you want to have a Love Thumper at level 61 or OP8 or whatever your level cap is, save the quest until you reach that point or just reset UVHM upon hitting the level cap. Otherwise, be content with what you have until it stops being useful - then promptly replace it with something better.  The Grog Nozzle scales with your level, by the way, so you don't need to worry about replacing that."
Borderlands2,3amoj0,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:32:35 2015 UTC,"Quick question about UVHM - I'm currently approaching the end of TVHM, and I'm not quite sure how resetting works. Does resetting affect the story and discovered locations as well?   So, for example, if I wanted to farm the mission with the robot at the start of Bloodshot Stronghold, would I have to reset, play through the whole story up to Bloodshot Stronghold, and then do that mission every time?"

Borderlands2,3amoj0,Spinach7,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"What resetting does is that your EXP, weapons, everything personal will be kept, but your story progress, DLC progress, Headhunter pack progress, map completion, etc, will be sent back to Liar's Berg, but the enemies, missions, etc will be adjusted to your current level."
Borderlands2,3amoj0,tepellin_10,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:17:14 2015 UTC,So what would you suggest swapping my love thumper out with when it becomes irrelevant? Just any old Roid shield? The main reason i love the LT so much is the long delay until it recharges and i'm not sure any other shield has that + the damage the LT puts out.
Borderlands2,3amoj0,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, any old roid shield. The Love Thumper isn't even end-game material for Zer0 in most scenarios - the Hide of Terramorphous is generally superior. Basically, once you see shields with roid damage that outstrip your Love Thumper, start thinking about replacing it."

Borderlands2,3am85h,TheBiggestDragon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:00:25 2015 UTC,I cant get a reliable internet connection to get more keys so I've been using tundra express as a way to farm.   Are there better places for quick chests?
Borderlands2,3am85h,Draless,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"i dont have any excellent advice but what i did when i was going into UVHM as a siren i farmed up a bee shield from the treants, slagga smg, unkempt herald, and i did the missions in the oasis for the hawk smg. problem is if you go back now into TVHM i think the mobs will only scale down to 50 so you will still have a gap .  maybe get a bee shield from tiny tina treants dlc and keep your mobs slagged."
Borderlands2,3am85h,t-y-c-h-o,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:50:16 2015 UTC,If you have tiny Tinas dlc go back to normal and farm dragon keep for a magic missile grenade mod. They're homing slag nades and regenerate ammo over time. I used a level 45 mod through uvhm to  slag.   Once something is slagged pretty much any current level weapon will do.
Borderlands2,3am85h,Satar123,-1,Mon Jun 22 23:02:37 2015 UTC,In UVHM axton can NOT do damage he can only slag. If you want good guns farm certain bosses like savege lee or bunker
Borderlands2,3am85h,Heroish17,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:18:41 2015 UTC,Yea i realized he's more of a slagger. We ended up farming TVHM's Terramorphus a couple times and got some nice cool down relics so now I'm throwing down my turret more often and slagging left and right.
Borderlands2,3anvsv,hotstickywaffle,2,Mon Jun 22 01:30:19 2015 UTC,"Claptrap is a lot of fun, mainly because of the randomness of the action skill"
Borderlands2,3anvsv,IconicNoseProjection,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:16:58 2015 UTC,But they have great synergy with each other e.g. you can make an epic nova/torge build basically explosive claptrap build.
Borderlands2,3anvsv,oi-__-io,2,Mon Jun 22 20:53:47 2015 UTC,Jack is the most powerful character in TPS because he has what is basically anarchy
Borderlands2,3anvsv,Satar123,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"There's not really a melee focused character in TPS. Athena and Wilhelm have some decent melee skills, but nothing too focused. Elemental Athena is great for stacking damage buffs, Wilhelm is godlike for survival with poor DPS (unless you marry lasers), Aurelia is glass cannon sniper class, Jack is solid all round good DPS buffs and Nisha is just godlike.  Claptrap I haven't even played and probably never will."
Borderlands2,3anvsv,_darkwingduck_,2,Mon Jun 22 02:19:48 2015 UTC,Athena has a melee skill tree. She is the melee character.
Borderlands2,3anvsv,Slyzavh,2,Mon Jun 22 03:07:11 2015 UTC,"Ok fair call, I've only played alongside an athena not as one so apologies."
Borderlands2,3akva0,caffeine314,11,Sun Jun 21 04:52:30 2015 UTC,"I've found in loads of places: thousand cuts near bunker, opportunity, basically anywhere with Hyperion ammo crates. In the preserve he can spawn in any box. And you can certainly find him without having DO active."
Borderlands2,3akva0,dunks6666,2,Sun Jun 21 06:46:23 2015 UTC,"Purely Coincidence, but I have found Jenkins more often by not having DO active."
Borderlands2,3akva0,Hawkfiend,-3,Sun Jun 21 13:31:02 2015 UTC,"As I've already said, I'm not posting the truth.  I've only reported my truth.  That said, after about 1010 hours of playing, no offense, but I don't believe this.  Maybe it's a platform issue.  I've reported observations of Borderlands, played on Steam, played on the PC.  I don't doubt it could very well be different on different platforms."
Borderlands2,3akva0,Hawkfiend,2,Sun Jun 21 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"I am on steam on PC.  Its fine that you wanna report what you have seen. That is all I am doing: reporting what I have seen. I don't mean to say that having DO active actually hampers your odds of getting Jenkins, I'm just relating that it coincidentally happened to me that way. Just like you coincidentally didn't see him without DO. Random is Random."
Borderlands2,3akva0,Hawkfiend,-2,Sun Jun 21 17:50:52 2015 UTC,Maybe you were playing on someone's server who was running CE.  Maybe you killed a Jet Loader so quickly that you thought it was Jenkins.  Maybe you modified an ini file and your modifications had unintended consequences. Anything is possible.  I'd be willing to play together from scratch till we first see Jenkins.  I'm willing to keep an open mind if you want to play together.  Totally serious offer.
Borderlands2,3akva0,dunks6666,3,Sun Jun 21 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"I played solo 80-90% of the time, occasionally playing with my one BL playing friend. I know he did not modify his game in any way. I did not modify any game files on my end. I am absolutely sure they were Jenkins. The first time I saw Jenkins (meaning I got the BAR challenge, confirming that it was in fact Jenkins), I did not have DO, and it was from a random hyperion ammo box.   I'd be willing to play together from scratch till we first see Jenkins. I'm willing to keep an open mind if you want to play together. Totally serious offer.   Thanks for the offer, but I'm gonna decline. I am not willing to spend that much time just to prove to a stranger on the internet that I have seen something they haven't. I respect that you were willing to keep an open mind and test, but I don't have the time nor do I care enough to test thoroughly."
Borderlands2,3akva0,ZhilTP9112,2,Sun Jun 21 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"Listen, I do not care if you haven't seen it. I do not care if that makes you not believe. It is not my fault you are so narrow minded.   Jimmy Jenkins can be found ANYWHERE inside a Hyperion loot crate, except the respawnable boss arena ones. And you don't need DO, as that only increases the chances in that one room in WEP."
Borderlands2,3akva0,vSmash__,-1,Mon Jun 22 06:23:35 2015 UTC,"It sure sounds like you care.  I'm sorry you got upset.  There's really no point in restating my disbelief so I'll just leave ot at that (my offer to play is extended to you, as well.)"
Borderlands2,3akva0,Sirbosco,5,Mon Jun 22 07:52:01 2015 UTC,"When you had the Doctor's Orders mission active, how many of the tapes had you picked up? I heard that the number of loot midgets/Jenkins that can pop out goes down as you pick up the tapes."
Borderlands2,3akva0,vSmash__,4,Sun Jun 21 06:17:46 2015 UTC,"The amount of loot midgets that pop out directly correlates to how many tapes you have left. If you pick up 1 tape, you'll get 3 midgets, you pick up 2, you'll get 2 and so on."
Borderlands2,3akva0,IconicNoseProjection,2,Sun Jun 21 10:46:11 2015 UTC,Not true.  I had 2/4 tapes picked up and always got three midgets. Sometimes four.
Borderlands2,3akva0,mama_tom,2,Sun Jun 21 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know man. Keep in mind, those boxes are also regular loot midget boxes (Basically there's a chance to spawn a loot midget even without the quest). Other than that I don't know what to say, literally every source I've seen on the topic, and my own firsthand experience say that it is true."
Borderlands2,3akva0,mama_tom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"The word ""relates"" doesn't necessarily imply a linear relationship.  It could even be something as complicated as a distribution of distributions.  I had 0 tapes obtained.  I was going to make DAMNED sure I was going to get the Completionist!  :-P   Whether it's true or not, it's certainly a really interesting hypothesis.  And if you were a coder, picking out round numbers for probabilities, having 0/4 tapes fits ""nicely"" with a 10% Jenkins rate.  If we had a controlled experiment with people who could be trusted to provide good numbers, I'll bet we could even figure this out... or wait till some developer does an AMA.  I'm actually a little curious (although now I've finished all the Steam achievements, I'm winding down to never play this game again until my daughter starts playing it.)"
Borderlands2,3akva0,Satar123,2,Sun Jun 21 17:12:13 2015 UTC,Ive found him right before the elevator to bunker a bunch of times
Borderlands2,3akva0,nakedapedude,4,Sun Jun 21 23:22:59 2015 UTC,If you didn't know you don't have to the whole run every time. You can just go into the preserve area if you have the dlc. That way you only have to do about a quarter of the run
Borderlands2,3akva0,mama_tom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:40:27 2015 UTC,"I've read that.   You mean similar to farming for short-chained at the junction of Thousand Cuts and Terramorphous Peak.  But for some reason it didn't work for me.  I went to the preserve, quit, restarted, and I was back at the start of the Annex.   Maybe it's a PC vs xbox thing?  I'm not sure.  But I did try."
Borderlands2,3akva0,mama_tom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"No, yeah. It was the annex. I just couldn't remember the name. It helps out a lot for grinding to have it."
Borderlands2,3am04v,teh_wizzey,2,Sun Jun 21 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"I mean if you have done all of the base game and 4 main DLCs and are looking for more content then yeah.  They are all pretty short, but I found them enjoyable enough.   I will say that if you are a thrifty gamer like myself then try to pick them up on sale. Right now they are all a buck per DLC on steam for the next 25 hours that are left in the summer sale. That price matches the low and it's what I paid for them. I think that's about what they are worth.  They all follow a holiday theme. If you are not going to get them all then I might rank as (V-day or Xmas or Craw) > (Halloween or Thanksgiving). But really just take your pick.  Son of crawmerax probably took the longest but YMMV. They are all pretty short."
Borderlands2,3am04v,Xero2814,2,Sun Jun 21 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"I love the mercenary day HH, I've been farming as maya on OP8 and got 3 legendaries from the train, a class mod and two guns!!

Borderlands2,3am04v,ParallaxParadigm,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:12:30 2015 UTC,Tiny Tina or the train. Both are worth it for the legendaries and grinding opportunities.
Borderlands2,3am04v,JebusMcAzn,0,Sun Jun 21 15:30:01 2015 UTC,First of all thx for replying. I have tiny Tina and its awesome ;)  Im asking for Headhunter's dlc not campaing . Hmm  what is this train think ?
Borderlands2,3am04v,cosiano35,3,Sun Jun 21 15:35:26 2015 UTC,The train DLC is Marcus's Mercenary Day DLC - the final boss is easily farmable and allows you to farm two big loot chests which have a pretty decent chance of containing some good stuff.
Borderlands2,3am04v,cosiano35,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:14:21 2015 UTC,"ohh ok i got it, it's the dlc with the snowman. thx :)"
Borderlands2,3am04v,cosiano35,0,Sun Jun 21 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"I just bought all of them during the summer sale. I was unimpressed. They take around 15 minutes to complete, they don't provide any new great farming places or guns.   I would take the combined price of ~$5 and just buy a different game such as the other longer dlc's if you don't have them or even BL 1."
Borderlands2,3alg3m,Zer0pix,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:43:16 2015 UTC,"i guess I have a question, whats the best way to farm? I'm 69 in UVHM and I leave it online with friends invite only like you said for drops, but I never really find anything.? I've farmed warrior 50+ and he dropped one legendary shield for me. Im not able to farm any of the raid bosses yet either so I'm kinda trying to figure out how to get gear."
Borderlands2,3alg3m,Draless,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"I'm level 72 in UVHM and I farmed WEP up until Rocko's Modern Strife. I now farm Thousand Cuts. No guaranteed loot midgets like WEP but also no enemies as long as RMS isn't turned in to Brick.

Borderlands2,3alg3m,nakedapedude,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"Dont farm the warrior, he is notoriously bad. Farm specific bosses for gear, or if you want a DPUH, go back into normal mode and do the bar brawl in the Torgue DLC, to get enough tokens. Then hop back into UVHM and farm the Torgue machine til you get one."

Borderlands2,3amz4t,L3gi0nn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"Just run with a tediore build.  Here is a good example showing what you need and how to do it  Edit: I am editing this because he is obviously level 72 in the video and has some very specific gear. Getting a baby maker and a gunerang will also work with Axton very well for a tediore build and require less precision while still doing a ton of damage. Just remember to slag. The gunerang is a bit tricky to get a hang of so practice a bit. If throwing is not really your style, explosive weapons will still be your best bet with Axton as he is able to utilize them better than any other character in the game. Yes, even more than Krieg. Just remember that him getting his shield up will really hurt your damage and beehawking might be your best bet to get his loaders down as well as his shield.   Good Luck"
Borderlands2,3amz4t,L3gi0nn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:05:22 2015 UTC,I have a super gunerang and about four different babymakers. I know he's supposed to be good with explosives and I have him spec as such but I don't see the results. I guess I need to watch some videos and try to work it out. Thanks!

Borderlands2,3al5ww,Ghostofjemfinch,4,Sun Jun 21 07:25:45 2015 UTC,"Enemies in UVHM have a chance of dropping items in a 2 level range of themselves. So if it's a level 61, it can drop from 59-61 since your cap is 61. If it were a level 59, it could drop from 57-61. It's lick of the draw really."

Borderlands2,3ai8e9,Hydraster,8,Sat Jun 20 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"yes, you can. however you will be severely overpowered and that may ruin the game for them. if you would just get level 61 stuff to play in their games that would be fine. though it will give you 11 more skillpoints and more health."
Borderlands2,3ai8e9,chickenXcow,3,Sat Jun 20 12:52:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, this is very helpfull. I think i'll just buy it and not use the lvl 61+ stuff while playing with them or have 2 different characters one for solo and one for coop. Is the UVH2 DLC worth it btw?"
Borderlands2,3ai8e9,chickenXcow,4,Sat Jun 20 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"it is defenitely worth it, i have all characters on lvl 72 now and most at OP8, i just cant get myself to get axton through op 5-8..."
Borderlands2,3ai8e9,smit4465,2,Sat Jun 20 13:10:00 2015 UTC,"You're going to need two different characters (or dup them). You can't just ""not use the lvl 61+ stuff"" because your level will be greater than 61 which causes all enemies to spawn at you level. It will make it very hard for your lower level friends"
Borderlands2,3ai8e9,Hawkfiend,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:55:29 2015 UTC,"If you want to duplicate you character to keep one lower level, you should be able to do that fairly easily by copying and renaming the save in the savegames folder.

Borderlands2,3ai8e9,ProjectGearhead,3,Sat Jun 20 14:54:28 2015 UTC,"If you are a level 72 and join a lower level game, all the new enemies that spawn will be a level 72. Makes it hard for the host to play."

Borderlands2,3aipwy,Jerdict,5,Sat Jun 20 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"I don't play Zer0, so don't take my word as gospel, but if I had to recommend two for each it would be a Lyuda/Pimpernel and DPUH/Grog Nozzle."
Borderlands2,3aipwy,VahrunePrefect,3,Sat Jun 20 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"When playing sniper Zer0 I typically use a Pimpernel or Lyuda, but sniper Zer0 can make almost any sniper rifle work. For general mobbing I use an Antagonist shield and a Bee for boss fights and I always keep a purple slag transfusion grenade. If you're interested in playing a lot of sniper Zer0, I would suggest checking out Man of Low Moral Fiber's YouTube channel, he does a lot of sniper and melee Zer0 videos and tutorials. Honestly sniper Zer0 is my favorite character and build in the game and can be quite overpowered when you learn how to use him effectively. Hope you have fun!"
Borderlands2,3aipwy,J-WaDe-_,2,Sun Jun 21 03:52:23 2015 UTC,"My brother specializes in that build, ill ask him later. Stay posted."

Borderlands2,3aipwy,zegg,2,Sat Jun 20 18:16:01 2015 UTC,I played a sniper Zer0 and a Pimpernel is a must. I never really liked the Lyuda due to the ammo consumption. My close range weapon was a Harold when necessary. I used a Bee shield constantly.
Borderlands2,3aipwy,Parasthesia,2,Sat Jun 20 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"Lyuda and Vladof snipers have really high DPS. Pimpernel is a beast, but the purple rarity Maliwan snipers have the highest one-shot kill potential at higher difficulties.   The Vladof Anarchist is the purple rarity all Vladof parts pistol. You know how people love the infinity? It's like that but more accurate, more damage.   Unkempt Harold is a beast in any prefix. Other fun pistols might be the Maggie."
Borderlands2,3aipwy,TheGamingHermit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:39:20 2015 UTC,"I usually don't even run snipers with my zero, I just use a infinity and a DPUH"
Borderlands2,3aipwy,Parasthesia,5,Sat Jun 20 21:37:37 2015 UTC,Infinity isn't as good as the straight Vladof only purple (or gemstone prefix) Anarchist pistol. And don't tell me you're going to run out of ammo.

Borderlands2,3ajn8t,hiiplayjax,2,Sat Jun 20 21:09:50 2015 UTC,Not sure about being OP as you can't get legendaries or pearlescents. I have got a couple of very cool etech assault rifles that I use regularly at level 72 but other than that the weapons you get you quickly out level.
Borderlands2,3ajn8t,nakedapedude,3,Sat Jun 20 22:33:59 2015 UTC,I got an etech sniper rifle that was nearly twice the damage of anything else I was finding at that level. All the stats were significantly higher. At level 48 it made a few fights that had me barely staying alive a walk in the park.
Borderlands2,3ajn8t,dekosx,2,Sat Jun 20 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"You won't feel that way on UVHM. Even bosses usually drop just 1 or 2 usable things. Also, stuff is waaay weaker after just one level. It's crazy I got a gun at 68 and killed fodder in one burst. Now at 70 it takes almost an entire magazine of 48."
Borderlands2,3ajn8t,Vegito1338,2,Sun Jun 21 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"I find them very useful in nvhm, and a good bit useful I'm tvhm, but almost useless in uvhm since legendaries have a higher drop rate in uvhm."

Borderlands2,3agc5e,mama_tom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:58:38 2015 UTC,It gives you Badass-Rank which gives you bonuses which you can use in the game. Like 0.4% more gun damage. It doesnt sound that much but when you complete all challenges it adds up.
Borderlands2,3ah6bw,ChillyToTheBroMax,2,Sat Jun 20 03:35:55 2015 UTC,"You can run sort of a ""budget gunzerker build"" which is what I've been doing while leveling in UVHM. A Chaotic Evil Monk helps so much and is honestly easily farmable - there's a popular route in the back of the Immortal Woods that's about 1 minute per run. You'll also want to grab a Sheriff's Badge from Lynchwood.  The Quasar is very nice to have but you can honestly substitute any singularity grenade - you want it to be either Sticky or Longbow (or both) ideally with a low fuse time. You should be able to take him out this way, with no need for a Norfleet or any E-Tech corrosive launcher."
Borderlands2,3ah6bw,JebusMcAzn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"I'll look for that COM. The berserker mod is just not cutting it. Not even able to dent those bots, even with an at-level sheriffs badge and DPUH."
Borderlands2,3ah6bw,_darkwingduck_,2,Sat Jun 20 18:42:08 2015 UTC,Do you have a sham equipped?  Very useful for the fight even sans norfleet just in case you get clipped by a rocket. What's the primary problem you're having with the fight specifically? If you can narrow down where it's going wrong might be able to help (I recently did this fight as OP1 Sal).
Borderlands2,3ah6bw,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:01:05 2015 UTC,Mostly damage output. Having a lot of trouble really hurting his Loaders.
Borderlands2,3ah6bw,_darkwingduck_,2,Mon Jun 22 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're pretty bullet spongey. A +6 money shot COM is going to be your best bet to whittle them down faster, but it's a slow burn. I actually had 2-3 loaders still left after killing Hyperius himself first time around. Killing them isn't entirely necessary, just hurt them all enough for them to make Hyperius vulnerable. I was fortunate enough to have a corrosive e-tech launcher (lv71) to help splash damage the loaders, but I did it mostly with the DPUH. A bullet regen class mod can come in handy too, given you'll chew through your bullets in this fight."
Borderlands2,3ah6bw,bman166,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:57:14 2015 UTC,"I guess I need to pay attention to when the bots fall asleep rather than trying to kill them outright.   Also, I have a lot of trouble getting good COM's to drop. Any suggestions on some good spots to farm?"
Borderlands2,3ah6bw,Plopyo94,2,Mon Jun 22 12:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yup, basically they'll provide a shield for Hyperius himself until they're damaged enough, then they begin to protect themselves. ONLY shoot at the ones that still have a beam arcing from them to Hyperius. When they are shielding themselves you cannot hurt them, and vice versa when they're shielding Hyperius. If you're trying to kill them while they're shielded that's why you're finding it tough (they won't die). You need to do it in phases, group the shield bots, hurt them, then hit hyperius hard when they protect themselves.  As for evil chaotic monk com (for +6 money shot and increased fire rate and critical damage) - go to mines of avarice in the tiny tina dlc, walk out the door to the woods to the left then follow the path through to conquerers crypt. There's two chests there with good chances of COMS. Save quit and repeat for farm. As for legendary COMs try the bug gulch behind Ellie's for tubbies, I've grabbed a few from there."

Borderlands2,3ae5kq,xabulba,7,Fri Jun 19 11:35:19 2015 UTC,"This is what I was running early game krieg.  Level 5: Action Skill! - Buzz Axe Rampage is Mania's bread and butter. Make sure you get some practice with the thrown buzz axes - they'll give you huge damage later on and be your only ranged attack option for around 80% of your play time. Learn to land them.  Level 6-10: Empty the Rage 5/5 - more damage means faster killing.  Level 11-15: Feed the Meat 5/5 - more health gives you more time to score a kill in BAR and keep the murder train rolling. It also lets you survive taking more damage, which helps BAR cool down faster.  Maxing both EtR and FtM lets you skip the next tier entirely, which you should probably do - Embrace the Pain is useless for a Mania-focused build, and Fuel the Rampage is not only a liability in co-op, but it's also entirely obsolete once you get Release the Beast later on.  If you're really having trouble keeping BAR ready to go when you need it you might decide to fill in FtR for leveling, but please respec out of it as soon as you get RtB at 31.  Level 16: Light the Fuse 1/1 - some people really dislike Light the Fuse, and it's understandable when you're not geared to maximize it, but it does obscene amounts of damage when properly buffed and it will become a staple of your playstyle if you do it right. Learn the proper timing for the dynamite throws; hitting the button as soon as Krieg pulls a stick out of the bundle will increase your attack rate and dps significantly. Learn to quickly isolate weak fleshy enemies for your detonation targets to maximize your recovery chances.  Level 17-21: Strip the Flesh 5/5 - Light the Fuse (and a lot of your other attacks later on) will benefit immensely from the damage boost from StF. LtF gets double the damage bonus - this will make your explosive revives stick a lot more often. If it's still not enough and you're really struggling, take Thrill of the Kill 5/5 instead for a massive survivability boost until you get Release the Beast.  Level 22-25: Salt the Wound 4/5 - Salt the Wound rewards you for taking health damage with a boost to melee and shotgun damage. Go toe to toe with your enemies, give them the first shot and then tear their goddamn heads off.  Level 26-30: Silence the Voices 5/5 - just like Light the Fuse, some people really don't like StV. Some people are stupid. StV is a huge boost to melee damage, which is vital for Mania. Yes, you risk hitting yourself, but that hit never has the damage bonus from StV itself applied. The chance of a self-hit is constant, too. All of this together means that you should either max StV or leave it alone entirely - if you're going to risk taking the self-hit, get as much damage as possible in exchange.  Level 31: Release the Beast 1/1 - this is where it all comes together for a Mania build. If you have enough health, damage reduction and reflexes in some combination, you shouldn't have trouble hitting BAR as soon as you dip below 33%. This is good, because from now on you should never ever ever use it above that point. Seriously. Release the Beast is why Fuel the Rampage has no place in a serious Mania build  Ninja Edit: Too many syllables"
Borderlands2,3ae5kq,xxafreemanxx,5,Fri Jun 19 13:10:48 2015 UTC,"Worth saying that with Silence the Voices, you should learn not to mash your melee swing button. I've found that if you mash it, you'll end up smacking yourself more often through more chances at the proc, quicker than the melee swing actually goes off."

Borderlands2,3aedqk,DetteSuger,4,Fri Jun 19 13:09:30 2015 UTC,"Melee Zero is tricky for Terra. But basically, at this level of play (Assuming OP8), you need certain equipment to be effective.  You want a good roid shield. This means either a high-end bandit roid purple, the pun-chee, the hide of terramorphus, or the love thumper. Law and order works too, but doesn't really scale well compared to the other shields listed here.  You also will NEED a melee attachment healing moxxi weapon. Preferably a grog nozzle with a melee attachment. Rubi works too (slag preferred), as does any other moxxi weapon, those with slag and melee attachments are preferred.  Your basic strategy when dealing with the raid bosses as a melee zero is to use deception and execute as often as possible, you'll want a cooldown relic or a bone of the ancients for this.  Once in deception, throw your kunai to apply the debuff from them, and be holding your healing weapon, so that any damage dealt to you in deception will be mitigated by the healing effect.  Break your shield with an EM grenade thrown at your feet. DO NOT use an EM bone of the ancients for exactly this reason.  I prefer using a lightning bolt or chain lightning for this, but you can also use tesla grenades or similar. What's important is that you can break your shield, but not hurt your own health too much. A 0.0 second fuse time is a requirement.  Now, you probably have about a second left on deception, wait til it reads 0.5 seconds or lower, and then melee/execute the enemy, preferably from behind.  This will inflict massive damage and heal you to full if you're holding the rubi/grog.   If you want to do more damage, use a rapier, but be cautious as you will not be healing while you're holding the rapier.  Rinse and repeat.  In between deception cooldowns, use health gating to stay alive, pick up more grenades (this is why I like lightning bolt since the grenades recharge) and etc.  Do some damage outside of deception where possible with your highest damage weaponry, either unkempt harolds, conference calls, lyudas, or whatever. For Terra, a fire weapon is usually best.  For second winds, it's a good idea to carry a powerful rocket launcher such as a Nukem, Norfleet, or Tunguska. But any rocket will do. You can also use procced grog nozzle shots from the unkempt harold to down tentacles and stuff. But preferably, you don't go down.  Melee zero is challenging against bosses, but entirely doable. Just remember, strip shields and health gate. Strike when deception is below 0.5 seconds remaining."
Borderlands2,3aedqk,artemisdragmire,3,Sat Jun 20 05:14:56 2015 UTC,This is incredibly precise
Borderlands2,3aedqk,TheNakedCount,2,Sat Jun 20 05:20:51 2015 UTC,"I recently maxed out a melee zero into OP8 and he's been my primary character recently.

Borderlands2,3aedqk,artemisdragmire,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:44:30 2015 UTC,Mele isn't good if you're in op levels because it doesn't balance. It overall isn't a good choice for boss battling. I recommend doing everything you can to boost your critical hit damage then get a lady fist because it's critical hit damage bonus is 800% it'll add up to almost 1000% critical hit damage bonus with the lady fist and everything. Also make sure to get b0re. Because when all his masher tentacles come out Pull out an infinity pistol or conference call and you'll tear him a new one!  Trust me man I've solo'd terry a ton and I farm hyperious daily as a zer0
Borderlands2,3aedqk,Powmpkin,2,Fri Jun 19 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"Um, what? Melee zero balances just fine on OP levels.   You just need a roid shield and an EM grenade to strip your shields, then melee the shit out of stuff when there's 0.5 seconds left on deception. You'll insta-kill most minor mobs and do a huge chunk of damage to bosses.  In between deception you just health gate with a grog or rubi.   Don't believe me?

Borderlands2,3ad31d,argv_minus_one,2,Fri Jun 19 10:04:28 2015 UTC,"If you don't have one, go get a ricochet barrel fibber from Mal (it'll be the one that supposedly has an insane amount of damage). It'll be a bit under levelled, but that didn't matter for me wen I was playing. It still carried me an insanely long ways. Invest in Close Enough so that your Anarchy is made up for. Preshrunk Cyberpunk is a great thing so that you get even more Anarchy stacks, as is Cooking Up Trouble. A lot of people will say to use Bloodsoaked Shields, but I don't bother. Basically, the great part abut an Anarchy Build Gaige is that you get extra damage and if you use Close Enough, the lack of accuracy doesn't even matter."
Borderlands2,3ad31d,VahrunePrefect,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:20:55 2015 UTC,"Just put one point into anarchy, get guns with low magazines and high fire rate to stack up quickly (most ppl prefer Jacobs shotguns) and put the rest of the points into the left tree so u and death trap get a boost. Also find a shield u and yr robot can benefit from like a nova shield."
Borderlands2,3ad31d,Zafords15,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:49:28 2015 UTC,"I always go full into the death trap free to the left one point in anarchy and the rest into the middle one, death trap never goes down in fights, get biggest shields possible, have one weapon that is a single or double shot to build stacks and one that has a huge clip (or just high damage) build stacks with the small clip one and switch over to the other one this isn't a super popular opinion but it's advise of someone who has only really played gage since her launch and don't really like the whole glitch (i don't think it's fun to glitch games or cheat during games, breaks how they are suppose to be played). I also think that the electricity skill tree is pretty good especially since it is easy to get chain lightning now a days."
Borderlands2,3ad31d,olyboy123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:28:04 2015 UTC,"also, weapons like the minecraft shotgun are really good for enclosed spaces, they boucle around and every bounce has a chance to hit another enemy."
Borderlands2,3ad31d,olyboy123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:30:39 2015 UTC,"I highly suggest a Conference Call shotgun. If you put points into the skills that allow Gaige's bullets to richochet, firing a Conference Call mag into a room will ping just about everything, and if you have Anarchy going with it, you'll be doing a large amount of damage too, and it won't matter that you're so inaccurate, because it's so awesome!"
Borderlands2,3ad31d,EmoteDemote,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:57:47 2015 UTC,"The best build is anarchy with points in the ricochet skill.

Borderlands2,3ad31d,_darkwingduck_,-1,Sun Jun 21 23:14:32 2015 UTC,"Gaige works best when glitching, spec anarchy, make sure you have preshrunk cyberpunk and get to 400 stacks, now to use this you want a jakobs single barrel shotgun. Use the infinate ammo glitch. Now you can spam like fuck. Spec into close enough and this will let you hit everything with your now shit accuracy. Lastly spec into buck up, use the creativity named buck up glitch to become a near invincible husk. (watch a video on how to do it) Merging a lady fist and a moxxi weapon will push the build to stupid levels and will allow you to walk the game without thinking."

Borderlands2,3acu8g,casa_quarta,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"The best way to level up is to do any side quest available. They may be tedious at times, but they keep you at the same level as the main missions. Also if you're having trouble with the warrior, you can hug the bottom of the ledge that you drop down from to reach the fighting area and he won't be able to fight back."
Borderlands2,3acu8g,Muffinofrage,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"Another way to beat the Warrior without taking much damage, is to go to the left side of the map where the regenerating ammo machine is. Under that roofed area, you will almost take no damage, except from the chrysalisk that spawns nearby.   If you need better gear, there is IMHO one of the best chests in the game to farm, right at the end of Hero's Pass, before you enter the Warriors area. Once you have gone through, come back into Hero's Pass, save, quit, reload, and you will be right next to the chest."

Borderlands2,3af119,jonra,7,Fri Jun 19 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"""I would like to thank news sites who chose to share the awesome work in Code Hunters with their readers. It's great content and one can no doubt imagine that a number of artists and designers at Gearbox were inspired and influenced by it. It was inspiring to me when ""The Incredibles"" was clearly a big source of influence for titles like Battlefield Heroes and Team Fortress 2 (and other amazing games and media). Perhaps with more attention from gaming news sites and other sources, Code Hunters can be more respected and honored for their innovation and leadership in CG as well. Maybe I'm too optimistic to believe that Code Hunters can get as much attention as Pixar (with due respect I believe they deserve), but with the help of gaming news sites and others who care about great content, maybe more people can notice and recognize and, perhaps, be inspired by it.""  ~Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO 2010"

Having to kill bandits with the eridium assault rifle for that mission SUCKS. I hate using that gun. I don't use a lot of assault rifles at all, much less early on in the story. So, it drags out because I'm constantly out of ammo for that gun.   Yet I still do it EVERY TIME."
Borderlands2,3a9q3j,rabenkraehe,3,Thu Jun 18 16:17:19 2015 UTC,Same here.  I do it because of the higher chance of the Infinity to drop

I don't understand why they chose a Bandit assault rifle to introduce E-tech, it makes no sense, it's a terrible gun, I hate it.  You can use other weapons, though, as long as they deal splash damage. When I do the quest I just ignore that stupid gun, eventually enough Pimpernel kills will have counted towards the objective."
Borderlands2,3a9q3j,fu3ll,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:34:47 2015 UTC,It seems that a lot of the Bandit eridium guns expand as you hold the trigger down and they take up more and MORE of your screen real estate.

Borderlands2,3aadyi,MetarexBeta,4,Thu Jun 18 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"Hi! Lvl 72 zer0 here. First thing i gotta say is that zer0 is maybe the best character in my opinion. He is so versatile. You can play him as sniper like you do, and then you would put your point in the sniper tree ""B0re"" is very important here. I doesnt really matter what skill build you do at your first playthrough though, cause you are gonna have to play the main story 3 times in this game. Personally, I am going a melee build. As on the first playthough, you struggle quite much with this, and mostly just use whatever you find and shoot people. But when you get your law and order, you can stay alive in the first playthorough. To get started, it might be smart to check out some dudes on youtube: ""https://www.youtube.com/user/LukeWW90"" This links to Man of Low Moral Fiber. He has very good gameplay, and here you can see what both ""Sniper Zer0"" and ""Melee Zer0"" looks like in action at highest level. If you have any questions you didnt get answered, please be a little more specific, and maybe I can answer. :D"

Borderlands2,3aadyi,DetteSuger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:56:39 2015 UTC,Hi! Thank you for making me not lose hope that Zer0 is indeed the best character. :) look what build I'm actually looking for and tell me what do you think. Also i asked why people underrate him. http://imgur.com/xHt33gn
Borderlands2,3aadyi,DetteSuger,2,Thu Jun 18 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"Ok dude, I am not a huge fan of that build you are having right there, personally I think that if you are going for sniping, you should not use your points in blodshred. If you are going for blodshred, you should fully focus on melee. But if you are focusing on sniping the rest of the points should be put in cunning so you get that ""Death mark"""
Borderlands2,3aadyi,TheFarthan,3,Thu Jun 18 16:15:54 2015 UTC,It's a great build if his priority is making it visually symmetrical lol.
Borderlands2,3aadyi,DetteSuger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"Death mark doesn't seem too useful because you have to melee. If I will do for Full sniper mode than its useless for the simple reason of being a sniper that is: Stay far away from the target, kill them with a maximum of 2 bullets or before anyone notices. I learned that from Sniper ghost warrior ;)"
Borderlands2,3aadyi,smartbycomparison,2,Thu Jun 18 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"Ahh that indeed is true if you are not going for lvl 60 builds, cause when you hit 60 you can get kunai, which procs death mark"
Borderlands2,3aadyi,DetteSuger,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:28:59 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by not going for lvl 60 builds? I am gonna play until i get lvl 72 on Zer0,Gaige and Maya :)"
Borderlands2,3aadyi,dasmekoad,2,Thu Jun 18 17:47:25 2015 UTC,Kunia + death mark is basically Zer0's bread and butter for all builds. Even when you see Man of Low Moral Fiber respectfully for a build he starts in the middle tree and gets down to Kunia before moving to the other trees. With the accuracy boosts you get you can hit people with Kunia from a distance and get death mark on them for the extra damage.
Borderlands2,3aadyi,dasmekoad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"I mean that when you actually get lvl 60, this build will begin to shine, because you can have kunai too, but at lvl 72 I dont really know the best sniper build, since I only play melee Zer0, I got a lvl 72 melee Zer0."

Borderlands2,3ab6x3,IKill4MySkill,3,Thu Jun 18 20:19:58 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that's an Infinity sir.
Borderlands2,3ab6x3,xxafreemanxx,3,Thu Jun 18 18:08:22 2015 UTC,All of the info you provided pretty much describes the Infinity. I don't think it could've been anything else.

Borderlands2,3ab6x3,Draco2000,3,Thu Jun 18 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"He could be trolling, but I don't think he is. It could just be that he's seen a version of the Infinity online or something, and because it looked slightly different than the one he had, he didn't think it was the same gun. After all, the Infinity can have slightly different looks. Some versions have a scope, some don't, it comes in different elemental types, etc.  Or maybe because he found the gun when he was more of a noob, and its stats were lower as a result, he didn't know he had in fact found this legendary pistol everyone talks about.   Because yeah, everything he's saying screams Infinity. It's even a known fact that Doc Mercy is the most likely to drop it."
Borderlands2,3ab6x3,TheFarthan,2,Thu Jun 18 19:27:22 2015 UTC,You probably got really lucky and got an infinity from doc mercy since it is a rare drop from him.

Borderlands2,3ab6x3,X_POiiSON_X,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:11:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm thinking about grabbing an Infinity for myself cause I've heard it's a good gun.

Borderlands2,3a9qmh,Alekseeef,3,Thu Jun 18 10:16:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy with the standard Grognozzler + DPUH + Bee pistol build.

Moxxi Good Touch or ideally for Salavador a Fire Alchemist pistol. Either way, here ya go.  you should watch a tutiorial how to beat him. just stand behind the rock by the gate, if he gets in close, run up to the gate and stand behind inside right gate pillar, right behind the rock. When his in close, use aunkempt harold, go crazy! you want to get him away. Rockets or LRG Spread Shotgun/Fire. Stand behind the inside gate pillar, you cant get hit here when he is up close, ""on the left"". upclose on the right, jump behind the rock. USE FIRE!! if you have it. DON""T USE GRENADES i.e FIRE, SHOCK, Or CORRISIVE. even SLAG only works once. Once used, he'll ussually turn on a amunnity to that element after that type of grenade is used. Fire ideally. Large Clip, Fire Rate. You need a pistol or somehting thats some what fast n accurate to get the Tentacles mid n far range. Bring a Transfusion Grenade for sure. Good luck' - Its hard the first time you do it. But after that, it just gets easier and easier. Soon you;ll be beating him everyday' - peace"

Borderlands2,3aa5q2,DetteSuger,5,Thu Jun 18 13:11:48 2015 UTC,"Ninja is definitely the better class mod for melee. Hunter is solid but the only reason you'd take it over Ninja is for Counter Strike, which isn't a reliable melee buff. Slag Rapier is more of a tip than an actual guideline. I mean, what other element are you going to get? A Slag Rapier is particularly useful for mobbing where you're not always in Deception and you don't always have Kunai available to slag - instead, you can shoot and melee, taking advantage of Be Like Water. To regain health, you're primarily relying on Resurgence (which gives up to 40% health back per melee kill, assuming you're using Legendary Ninja). Using a Grog Nozzle + Chain Lightning is also viable, and just means you'll need to be mindful about swapping weapons when you're low on health."

Borderlands2,3a7v6a,n0mana,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Season pass would still be good to get because even though it's not all of them it is the 4 major story dlcs for cheaper than they would be alone. in order to get all the story dlc and characters get these packs.   Season pass: Includes 4 major story dlcs and level cap increase upgrade pack. Psycho pack: Unlocks Krieg as a playable character. Mechromancer Pack: Unlocks Gaige as a playable character.  Head Hunter packs 1-5: 5 Little dlcs that each come with one area filled with unique enemies, a few missions, and tends to have a secret hidden in the map somewhere. You also get a free head for completing the first mission in them.   These 2 are optional because they are mostly an area to run through to get a loot reward.   Ultimate Vault hunter upgrade pack 2: Adds digistruck peak area and increases level cap again. (If you want to get to the highest level possible, you need to get this) Creature Slaughter Dome: No real story, just hop into arena and kill stuff for loot. I'd skip it, but that's just my opinion."
Borderlands2,3a7v6a,Muffinofrage,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:02:35 2015 UTC,I should mention that this is implying that you are getting it from steam. If you aren't then you would be better off buying the GOTY edition because for some reason consoles don't lower the price of DLC over time.  Edit: And I forgot to say that the GOTY edition doesn't include the Head hunter dlc packs. So you'd need to buy those as well.
Borderlands2,3a7v6a,Muffinofrage,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:16:19 2015 UTC,"Given past steam summer deals, some games will come up more than once during the cycle. I'd hold out until its about to wrap up before buying any more pieces"

Borderlands2,3a6nfc,ReddBro,2,Wed Jun 17 17:21:22 2015 UTC,Try exiting go the main menu. Then re-select your character. When you click play it should ask you whether you want to play normal or tvhm.
Borderlands2,3a6nfc,X_POiiSON_X,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:09:26 2015 UTC,Correct.  But if you start the story for your character the game will ask you if you want to fast forward through already completed chapters.
