NYKnicks,3e2k58,shadowrabbit,5,Tue Jul 21 13:46:35 2015 UTC,He who shall not be named at 1.
NYKnicks,3e2k58,Counter423,4,Tue Jul 21 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"As a matte of fact, I didn't know who. You could have been talking about Grant, Porzingis, or Ndour."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,johnhenryirons,11,Tue Jul 21 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"If I had a house, I would bet it that both Afflalo and Williams will not exercise their player options in a year when the cap will increase nearly 30% and in a very dry free agency class."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,ch-dev,6,Tue Jul 21 15:37:51 2015 UTC,A dry free agency class? Isn't 16' supposed to have a lot of big time free agents?
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,ThaBigSKi,8,Tue Jul 21 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"There is a massive number of Free Agents with a decent number of talent at the top, and then it has a pretty large drop off. Not too many tier 2 guys."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,Schildkrotes,3,Tue Jul 21 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"There's Durant and Horford and then a bunch of tier 3 guys (unless I'm missing something). Who are the ""massive number of free agents""."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,ch-dev,3,Tue Jul 21 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Durant, Horford, Conley, Noah is really it.. Everyone has been talking about this being a super deep class, but it really isn't. There are just a lot of people regardless of talent that are available. There are a lot of guys with options this offseason as well that might not show up on lists.   There were about 150 FA's this year. Next year there will be closer to 200. It's not necessarily talent rich."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,Schildkrotes,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yup. Agreed. I would add Al Jefferson to the list, but that's about it."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,ch-dev,4,Tue Jul 21 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"Not ""big time"" unless your definition of ""big time"" doesn't match mine.  There's Durant, a long empty void, then Horford, then Noah and then a bunch of other 3rd tier players. All that needs to happen is for Durant to re-sign with OKC for 2016 free agency to be one of the driest classes of the past decade or so."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,ch-dev,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:33 2015 UTC,Yes.. One of the deepest free agencies in history
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,truthfroyo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"deepest? after durant, there aren't going to be too many franchise changing guys."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,E-Miles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:06 2015 UTC,I disagree. Which unrestricted free agents are referring to?
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,ch-dev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"Uh, outside of Durant (might, probably will re-sign), Horford (re-sign), Conley (re-sign), and kind of Noah there is no one that great."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,DamnCroissants,2,Tue Jul 21 20:56:04 2015 UTC,"And since I have a house, I would bet it that 1 of the 2 will suck this year, and milk us for there contract next season."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,KingNickyThe1st,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:44 2015 UTC,Agreed. Williams is already overpaid as it is.
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,itwentboom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"I expect him to be WAYYY better than expected. Afflalo, not so much"
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,KingNickyThe1st,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:07 2015 UTC,Based on what? He doesn't shoot well and is a horrible defender. The only thing he does well is dunk.
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,itwentboom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:32 2015 UTC,"because some people need to play in the big time in front of a crowd with pressure and expectation. When you can slack off and even if you were a 15 10 guy not get second of media, its easy to slide. He did an interview and said that was his #1 problem was the motivation from playing in such a low key market"
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,KingNickyThe1st,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:42 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what people said about Bargnani, and then it turned out Bargnani was who he was always going to be."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,itwentboom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"Injured all of the time? Bargnani was overpaid on the Knicks, but he wasn't a scrub. That and he was great in Toronto before he had these 3-4 seasons of injury. His work ethic was garbage, but he had talent. Nothing is to say that Williams will be the same."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,DamnCroissants,2,Tue Jul 21 20:57:40 2015 UTC,"It depends on how well both of them play. I feel like this is going to work in our favor, and their's too."
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,therealjgreens,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:26 2015 UTC,If we really can't afford a max player we can always stretch Calderon out or try to trade his expiring contract away.
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,Kliang9281,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:31 2015 UTC,Sort of hoping him and Jerian both play well first half of the season so we can trade Calderon away.
NYKnicks,3e2q3i,shadowrabbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"Answer:  No, because there's only 1 free agent in 2016 even worthy of a max and Durant ain't coming to New York."

NYKnicks,3e2s83,azizinator25,5,Tue Jul 21 15:05:04 2015 UTC,But I thought Melo never liked the pick and never contacted Zinger?

NYKnicks,3e0aus,yurgon,7,Tue Jul 21 00:02:08 2015 UTC,"eh... i wish him the best but he said himself he struggled last year with the system offense.  That, combined with the fact that we're trying to get younger and better defensively, he doesnt really fit in anymore.  i do think we need another gaurd cause having Gallo, grant, and ledo as our only backups is a little frightening."
NYKnicks,3e0aus,Vanchat,-16,Tue Jul 21 01:41:05 2015 UTC,he's not good..delusional knick fans in this sub.
NYKnicks,3e0aus,uguuguu2,9,Tue Jul 21 02:19:06 2015 UTC,Mind your tongue. Pablo is the best third string PG in the league.
NYKnicks,3e0aus,Vanchat,-6,Tue Jul 21 07:27:49 2015 UTC,yes another fav of this sub that is great as long as they don't get off the bench
NYKnicks,3e0aus,uguuguu2,4,Tue Jul 21 07:56:09 2015 UTC,"Our team actually played better when he was on the court. Of course, on a poopie team he'd be less effective but he's a nice veteran to have...though he is no longer a fit with us. He's better off on a contender or Europe or wherever."
NYKnicks,3e0aus,mikerhoa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:04:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, maybe? You're basically saying he plays better when the team around him is better, that's not exactly high praise for a PG..."
NYKnicks,3e0aus,Vanchat,-3,Tue Jul 21 11:49:40 2015 UTC,"He's not a fit on a contender either..he was terrible in the playoffs for Houston and they dumped him for a good reason.  he shot 33 percent, 29 percent from 3."
NYKnicks,3e0aus,petezahut93,3,Tue Jul 21 08:49:40 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd like to see Priggy Smalls back (and I liked him a lot), I feel that he'd probably be better off going to another team, one particularly overseas so that he can get more playing time and  potentially get paid maybe not to the tune of Shved but still better than $440,000."
NYKnicks,3e0aus,AlphakirA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:01:40 2015 UTC,Love watching him play with that insane hustle that few have. Hope he lands with a contender - one that I can root for.

NYKnicks,3e0aus,Tankye_West,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:40 2015 UTC,Sometimes the numbers aren't as true as we want them to be. He was a good solid player. Great effort. I would imagine a good locker room guy.
NYKnicks,3e0aus,daydream05,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:29:30 2015 UTC,You're kidding right? He was one of the reasons why we had 54 win team at one point. Do you even watch bruh? I guess you're one of those who like high ppg = good player. Go back to r/nba/
NYKnicks,3e0aus,mikerhoa,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"He was one of the reasons why we had 54 win team at one point.   I... I just... I don't even know how to answer such an asinine comment.  By your logic that means he's equally responsible for a 37 win season and half of a 17 win one. And where did I say anything about ppg? If anything, he averaged a double digit ppg off the bench for us, which actually works in favor of him.  You don't have a clue what you're talking about, do you..."

NYKnicks,3e0rpc,suckerNYKfan,4,Tue Jul 21 02:58:12 2015 UTC,I feel like Porzingis has a higher floor and a bigger advantage than dirk. The game is different and Porzingis learned a lot from watching guys like Dirk and Anthony Davis play.

NYKnicks,3e13mo,nicejerk,2,Tue Jul 21 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"This would suck, and I don't know of a realistic instance where we end up getting the sort of picks that truly help you with a rebuild.   We have Carmelo, the dude who is the best at getting buckets on the fucking planet, in his prime, in a knicks jersey...   Let's keep it that way."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,nbadog,3,Tue Jul 21 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"Damn, can we see how this team plays together before thinking about any kind of Melo trade?"
NYKnicks,3e13mo,Irreversible_Rape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:44:09 2015 UTC,Who do you think would actually take Melo? Clippers would want him but they don't have any young pieces we could use. So what would be a team that would take Melo and give us young players & draft picks... Orlando? Lol
NYKnicks,3e13mo,KiseRyota,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:52:17 2015 UTC,"we'd be better off in the future, the problem is that we don't have our pick right now. The absence of this pick is what's stopping people (PJ included) from committing to a full rebuild."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,jrg114,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:15:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think we're in a better spot right now. We don't have a pick this year and any team that would take him and give us a pick in return would be out of the lottery. The next couple of seasons is all about getting Free Agents and we can do so with Melo in town. We are on a set path towards contention that won't happen this year, but can in the next few.   On the contrary, if we wanted to take from the mold of the wolves and sixers, we could send Melo for a handful of future firsts, give Porzingis four years to develop while we pull a Cavs and land the number 1 pick every year and be potentially very very good. We'd have to send away all of the guys we signed pretty much and succumb to being awful for another 5-6 years before anything truly exciting happened. We wouldn't have Phil anymore if that happened. Anyone can tank.  I really like where we are at now. The Knicks fan base isn't ready for a sixers like rebuild. This plan we have is taking us in a good direction with quality players and youth. There is a lot of future potential on our roster and a lot of money to spend in the next couple of years. If we show up well this season, we will be an attractive place for FAs and we will be right in the thick of the playoffs next season."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,Schildkrotes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:03 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this be awful for 5-6 years theory.  You need to find 2 stars and surround them with complementary pieces.  5 starters and 8 man rotation should not take more than 3 years with a little luck.  The Suns were predicted to win 17 games 2 years ago and wound up winning 49, that was a quick rebuild.  Same with the Bucks who went from the worst record in basketball to playoffs in one year.  If your front office sucks and wants to buy themselves time, than you'll here this 5-6 year timeline."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,ynksjts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:09 2015 UTC,"We have a wonderful FO right now, which is why we are not doing the 5-6 year plan. We're a lot closer to being the Bucks last year, this year. If we sent everyone away, I'm sure Phil would get fired and we'd start at square one with no direction. The benefit of doing the 5-6 year plan, if you have picks, is you have so much more time to land a Curry/Thompson, Russ/KD type of duo. On the other hand, we can be in contention and be the Spurs and get very very quality players at  the 25 pick that we develop into even better players that perform at our level in our system.  Again, I think we are in so much better of a position going forward than we ever would be without Melo."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,Schildkrotes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:44 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't be fair to the fan base - PJ has done all the right moves this off season to mold us into a playoff contender with the hope to lure more impactful FA's next summer. Trading Melo would yield sour grapes to potential clients, as Melo seems to bleed Knicks and eagerly wants to be here.  Not having a draft pick this year sort of takes away our tanking options."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,katnyp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:05 2015 UTC,"If he asked to be traded we'd get way less than if we traded him on our own because it would force our hand.  If teams knew he was unhappy, they'd offer garbage.  A potential young building block, a good role player to help make the salaries work and an unprotected first would be a decent haul."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,ynksjts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:38 2015 UTC,Cant wait to see a healthy Me7o so these convos stop. How quickly people forget what a beast this guy is.
NYKnicks,3e13mo,Onlythewrong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"No way, seeing some of the contracts handed out in FA we have Melo for a bargain."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,ofcrazed,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"No trade clause probably limits possibilities to L.A., Chicago or LeBron.   Clippers: Not a chance. No way they trade Blake, CP or DeAndre, unless Doc Rivers has a bizarre sense of humor.  Lakers: Nothing makes sense for either team. We'd need something like their pick next year plus Russell, Randle, or Clarkson. Bad for them and bad for us. Moving on. Bulls: I bet they'd trade Rose straight up for Melo. We'd be crazy to do it. But what if they threw in a couple of picks, or Mirotic or Portis? Personally I still wouldn't do it unless we could get another team involved and end up with a great young player and a probable lottery pick. But this at least seems plausible. LeBron: Would Melo accept a trade to Cleveland for a chance at a couple of titles? If both Melo and Love are extremely unhappy this year, and especially if Kyrie's knee issues slow him down (so the Cavs need more offense), I could see a straight up swap happening, or a three team deal where Love ends up elsewhere and we get a package of players and picks. This one makes the most sense to me, but still highly unlikely."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,engine333,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"Harden was traded for ""younger"" assets, and it sort of smacked OKC in the head afterwords.  These superstar trades don't usually work out unless you're getting a plethora of picks, from a crap team who looks like they will be crap for a long time coming (so we get higher picks due to their terrible win record), or another superstar in return. Like logically speaking, if Melo wants a trade it's going to be to the Cav's and we'd likely need Love in return. Love is nowhere near Melo in talent. However that's the most likely scenario because A. Lebron's 3 best friends (he stated this) is Wade, CP3, and Melo, B. Love is one of those out lier players in Cav's, they signed him because they gave so much for him, Melo would instantly make the Cavs such a super lock for the championship."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,xarziv,9,Tue Jul 21 04:20:21 2015 UTC,"The differences between this situation and the Harden one are so plentiful that it's basically not analogous at all:  1) Harden was quite young himself at the time of the deal - Only 22. Carmelo is 31, by comparison.  2) OKC were contenders when they dealt Harden away - There was no need to get younger or alter the makeup of their team, as opposed to the Knicks, who could benefit from this.  3) They didn't get a good deal - Houston had some assets, but no blue chip ones. Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb and some picks that weren't guaranteed to be any good is a horrible deal.  By comparison, the deal that Minnesota got for Kevin Garnett was a good one, and compares more favorably to this situation."
NYKnicks,3e13mo,Vinnie_Vegas,5,Tue Jul 21 04:53:51 2015 UTC,and the most glaring difference... 4) Harden was perceived to be a very good player but hardly a superstar at the time of the trade. That all changed of course once Harden blew up in Houston and really showed people what he could do. Had OKC really understood what they had they surely would have demanded more for him.
NYKnicks,3e13mo,rivasdre,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:25:41 2015 UTC,"We need to trade him and rebuild.  Barring an off season miracle in the next 2-3 years (which is highly unlikely to occur), we are not going to contend until he is past his prime."
NYKnicks,3dywln,AncientCaptain,7,Mon Jul 20 17:37:21 2015 UTC,"i want to keep ledo. i don't look that much in too summer league stats,because they don't matter. the thing thats important is ledo can shoot,score and that what we need off the bench."
NYKnicks,3dywln,MrTape,4,Mon Jul 20 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"I hope we don't, he doesn't seem to have improved his game much at all.  Although he'd be good off the bench for some scoring, I'm nto sure if it's worth a spot when we could get another player (Ndour / Thanasty) in his place.  But he has a partially guaranteed which may change things."
NYKnicks,3dywln,mersh547,8,Mon Jul 20 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"Thanasis has zero offense, and Ndour is not a 3, so we still don't have a perimeter scorer off the bench. Ledo has at least shown he can be good in transition, and has potential to be a strong scorer if he just keeps working on his handles.  A shooter with his strength despite being underweight is a rarity in the league. 6'7 SG with legit 3 range and a bully ball attitude is a nice thing to have"
NYKnicks,3dywln,cyph3x,4,Mon Jul 20 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking about making a post about ledo. Ended up with five assist versus the bucks. Not enough improvement, but showed some passing. I think Phil likes his size/mis match potential.  To be honest, this guy needs weight. 195 at 6 7?Jesus christ. Low rebound/passing for his size. If anything it'd be for his potential and offense. Defensively, not average.   I might let him go."
NYKnicks,3dywln,4waves,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:05 2015 UTC,Do you go for one of the Summer League guys or do you look for a free agent as a replacement?
NYKnicks,3dywln,kej718,6,Mon Jul 20 17:53:19 2015 UTC,Ndour Does a little bit of everything and seems to fit the guys we have brought in during free agency.
NYKnicks,3dywln,mersh547,5,Mon Jul 20 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would aim for whoever has the highest ceiling.  We aren't winning now.  I'd rather get a Summer League guy, someone who hasn't learned a ton of bad habits in the association yet, and mold him into our system.  Granted, Ledo may be that guy.  He's only 22.."
NYKnicks,3dywln,xarziv,2,Mon Jul 20 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, i want to keep him. He has it all really, just needs to put it together."
NYKnicks,3dywln,4waves,0,Mon Jul 20 18:07:58 2015 UTC,Good point. Maybe he is worth it.
NYKnicks,3dywln,4waves,3,Mon Jul 20 20:20:39 2015 UTC,Depends who's available I think a signing like Ndour isn't a bad one. I like his game.   I think Kirk is too unathletic. Doesn't impress.  .

NYKnicks,3dx2qw,therealjgreens,0,Mon Jul 20 18:08:12 2015 UTC,There isn't really anyone of any value left. O'Quinn and Lou are probably going to have to fill a decent portion of minutes at C. We might as well just sign Labeyrie and stick him in the D-League until someone gets injured.
NYKnicks,3dx2qw,TheCurseOfJamesDolan,0,Mon Jul 20 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need another backup center. Between Lopez, O'Quinn and Amundson, we should be set. I'd much rather focus our efforts on a true backup SF unless we feel confident in Early and Thomas."
NYKnicks,3dx2qw,ch-dev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'd rather focus on another guard. I'm thoroughly unimpressed by Ricky Ledo and we only have 4 other guards on the roster between Calderon, Galloway, Grant and Afflalo. Knowing Calderon's age and past season it's somewhat likely that he gets injured and we'll need someone to fill up those minutes."
NYKnicks,3dx2qw,Kliang9281,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"I think between those four guys, they'll probably cover 80-90% of the minutes played at SG and PG. We have very good backups for both positions.  However, when Melo sits, or in those cases when Melo swings over to the 4, we don't have anyone to fill in other than Early and Thomas.  That kinda scares me more than finding a 3rd string SG or a 3rd string PG."
NYKnicks,3dx2qw,ch-dev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:31 2015 UTC,I can see Ndour playing backup for Melo at SF

NYKnicks,3dx2qw,44lennox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"I guess he'd be the guy. I've always seen him as a power foward and assumed he would back up Porzingis.  Then, if Williams backs up Melo, and O'Quinn backs up Lopez, who backs up Porzingis?"
NYKnicks,3dx2qw,ch-dev,0,Mon Jul 20 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"I've been really confused with the SF/PF/C rotation because I just can't see Kristaps playing 20/25 minutes a night. This is my best guess, but idk  SF: Melo 35 mpg / Lance Thomas 10 (?) / DW + Aaron Afflalo 3 PF: KOQ  20 mpg / Kristaps 20 / DW + Lou 8 C: RoLo 35 mpg / Mauricie Ndour (or Backup C) 10 / KOQ 3   Is that awful? Any ideas?  This is all contingent on KP playing only PF and not starting, two things I see likely."
NYKnicks,3dx2qw,44lennox,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:00 2015 UTC,Early would get the minutes allocated to Lance Thomas at the 3.

If it's used sparingly, I wouldn't mind seeing the Knicks incorporate an alt, but again, I think their normal jerseys are some of the more iconic in the league, in a group with the Lakers, Celtics, and the Bulls, and because of that, I'm not big on them shifting too far away from them."

NYKnicks,3dsskd,aliencircusboy,4,Mon Jul 20 06:03:45 2015 UTC,The holiday and Nueva York ones are more than enough. One of the many things I like about both the Knicks and Yanks is the tradition and consistency. You don't see a whole bunch of alternate Yanks uniforms like the A's or Marlins or even Mets. And you don't see any fucking mascot. (Another reason the mascot-hating and baiting RoLo fits in so well with the team.)

NYKnicks,3dsskd,thestral_rider,4,Mon Jul 20 12:41:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that. Since they've recently worn the orange alternate though, I think they should just do black instead."

NYKnicks,3du2ee,nittun,5,Sun Jul 19 14:08:39 2015 UTC,"ya that's what I was thinking, look what happened when he reunited with Mike Brown in Cleveland. I think Phil could get some production from him and he knows the triangle"
NYKnicks,3du2ee,BaLLisLifeSometimes,17,Sun Jul 19 14:25:02 2015 UTC,I think he's knees are shot and also he's a dumbass.
NYKnicks,3du2ee,c_c_combo,0,Sun Jul 19 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"Why do you say he is a dumbass?  I've heard reports saying both that he is a dumbass, and that he has a very IQ and is just severely downtrodden by his injuries."

NYKnicks,3du2ee,BaLLisLifeSometimes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:54 2015 UTC,He used to race his supercar down his block where little kids were playing. He used to play loud music around his neighbors at night. He shot 3 pointers in a game during a fast break and countless other immature acts.
NYKnicks,3du2ee,Clown_Shoe,8,Mon Jul 20 00:07:46 2015 UTC,I think you are confusing selfishness with stupidity.
NYKnicks,3du2ee,onebandonesound,7,Mon Jul 20 00:14:04 2015 UTC,Neither are a desirable trait on a basketball court
NYKnicks,3du2ee,BaLLisLifeSometimes,4,Mon Jul 20 01:26:39 2015 UTC,"Either way, would you want a selfish or stupid player on the Knicks?"
NYKnicks,3du2ee,Clown_Shoe,3,Mon Jul 20 01:44:40 2015 UTC,If they are very talented I would.  I dont want another JR Smith but the next Vince Carter sure.  If the Bynum of old was available in a heart beat.  I highly doubt he can be that player anymore though.
NYKnicks,3du2ee,BaLLisLifeSometimes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:16:09 2015 UTC,You said it. He's not the same player. His knees have given out.
NYKnicks,3du2ee,ballerdjballer,9,Mon Jul 20 04:39:13 2015 UTC,I am iffy about this. His talent is undeniable and he was in the debate of best center for a year or two  But again he is known to be a detrement to a team.   But again fisher and phil are the best people that know  him more than anybody so maybe they can help him get his act straight  But again New york city is not the place you go to get ur act straight.  I dont know..i am okay with if whatever happens..sign him dont sign him..whatever..
NYKnicks,3du2ee,Schildkrotes,6,Sun Jul 19 16:02:05 2015 UTC,I think the ideal contract would be a 2 year vet minimum second year non guaranteed. We can test him for a year and he could be a potential trade chip.
NYKnicks,3du2ee,artvandelay1994,6,Sun Jul 19 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's the kind of deal that he comes back and probably only plays for the Knicks. Phil and Fisher may be able to get the most out of him and I think the league would see that if it worked out. There are SO MANY what if's associated with this move though. If it works, we're geniuses. If it doesn't, we have a really shitty guy in the locker room. I think you're right on with the 2 yr vet minimum non-guaranteed. That is the easiest way to cover our asses. I think I'd be okay with it. I think.."

Even if his production is half of what is was in 2011-2012 that is a huge boost. If anybody can keep him motivated it is phil."

NYKnicks,3dqh0z,EzekielMurphy,31,Sat Jul 18 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"My thinking is that they would cross this - have Melo at the 4 and operating in the post on offense with Kristaps providing spacing, but have Zinger guard the 4 at the other end and use his length on D to spare Melo those matchups."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,odeebee,4,Sat Jul 18 13:41:27 2015 UTC,"Bingo. We're also discounting the role the 3 plays in the triangle - not the same in every offense. The 3 needs to be quick as well as an excellent shooter and cutter. I love Zinger, but those aren't his best talents."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,MattPH1218,4,Sat Jul 18 15:27:55 2015 UTC,"The offense part makes sense to a degree. But on defense, that's the opposite of you want. Melo can't defend on the perimeter anymore. He is terrible there. You put him out there, and it's going to be another year of watching teams rain threes because he's slow over screens and slowly to recover to the perimeter.  What you want is a Shawn Marion type up front with him -- a true stopper who can guard the best forward whomever he is -- so Melo can guard whoever is left over.  I know that was the theory behind signing Derrick Williams. The problem is it's unlikely Williams will be productive enough to warrant serious minutes."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,chingt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:05:55 2015 UTC,"Well said. I didn't even consider Melo's perimeter defense, and that does rationalize the KOQ and Derek Williams signings a bit."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,MattPH1218,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:28:19 2015 UTC,I'd rather have bad perimieter D by Melo than have him get beat up by bigger guys on the post on defense.
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,Anumist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:28:34 2015 UTC,"There are matchups where it makes sense to move him to SF (i.e. Zach Randolph), but there aren't too many big PFs who like to post up left in the league. At 230 lbs, Melo is just as big as most power forwards, just shorter. He's bigger than Draymond Green, for example.  And there's just as much risk of wearing down guarding perimeter players from running around and making sharp turns. You may get bruises defending the post, but you don't put the same wear on your ligaments and you don't wear down your cartilage as much."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,chingt,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:55 2015 UTC,"I like what i saw from Prozingis in the post tho, his footwork was incredible and when he would get the ball curling to the pinch post area, he was hitting all those shots with ease"
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,acb123,11,Sat Jul 18 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about how Kyle O'Quinn (PF), Derrick Williams (SF/PF), Melo (SF/PF) and KP (PF) would work. At first glance, it looks like a logjam, but I think it could be managed. Though Fish is going to have to earn his money managing these minutes.  I think we're realistically going to be playing Melo at the 3 and 4 a lot, but we're no longer going to see the Melo of 35+ minutes. This is just a function of the fact he's 31, coming off knee surgery. Nobody particularly wants to see him run into the ground. This is going to free up a lot of minutes of Derrick Williams and KP at the 4.  KP will come off the bench at the 4, and occasionally the 5, since we've really got only Robin Lopez and Amundson there, and I expect Amundson's minutes will go down a lot. KP is a great player, with a high ceiling. He's identified himself as more of a 4. He'll play some minutes at the 5, but putting him there against most centers right now is just asking him to get bumped and bruised. The worst thing someone could do right now is start him and let him get bodied in the post for 30+ minutes a game. He'll be hitting the weight room hard for the first few months. I expect his minutes will go up as the season goes on, and wouldn't be surprised to see him start ~20 games before the season's over.  Kyle O'Quinn is likely starting at the 4. He's a solid defender, with a reliable midranger. KO sagging away from the net when Melo drives has the potential to turn into easy buckets for us. His contract is also super favorable. So if we drop him to the bench at any point (for example, if KP turns into Superdirk), we're not sitting here wringing our hands because we're giving all this money for a guy to come in and back up a teenager.  We've got some good, reliable tools. It's on Coach Fish and Coach Rambis to slot them in right."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,partipo,3,Sat Jul 18 14:41:47 2015 UTC,Much more likely that KOQ also gets minutes at the 5 over guys like Amundson and Zinger. Zing is simply too weak as of now and Amundson isn't good enough to be a primary backup. I also think KOQ will be better at the 5 than 4 (as with Derrick Williams at the 4 rather than 3) but I suspect our lineups will be on the bigger side this season.
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,TrillJackson,4,Sat Jul 18 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"Robin Lopez has never played more than 30 mpg.  Amundson won't play unless there's an injury, which makes O'Quinn the backup C at least until Derrick Williams proves he's not a starter quality player. O'Quinn is plenty big enough -- 6'10"", 240lbs with a long wingspan and lots of muscle -- to guard Cs.  Melo at 31 and coming off surgery is not going to play 38 mpg. 34 mpg is a nice number for him.  So that makes the rotation look like this:  C: Lopez 28 mpg, O'Quinn 20 mpg PF: Williams: 24 mpg, Porzingis 24 mpg SF: Melo 34 mpg, Early 10 mpg, Afflalo 4 mpg SG: Galloway 20 mpg, Afflalo 28 mpg PG: Calderon 24 mpg, Grant 24 mpg  10 man rotation. If Early sucks again, you push Afflalo up to SF for his minutes and play Grant and Galloway the extra 10 mins. I wouldn't count on Calderon staying healthy if he plays more than half the game.  I don't love this situation because it means Melo is defending small forwards, where he's a train wreck, but it's the roster Jackson built, and I guess Williams can guard 3s instead of Melo if the situation calls for it.  My real issue is long term Melo is going to have to become more and more a PF as he continues to slow down, and that's really the only position Porzingis fits for unless he gains a lot of muscle and improves his rebounding dramatically."

Afflalo still gets his minutes, but leads the talented second unit.  I just don't know if Galloway can't yet be relied on to be a starter on a competitive team. He had an impressive rookie year, but he's still an undrafted, second-year player."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,TheCurseOfJamesDolan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"I'm going based off numerous reports that the plan for Afflalo was to use him as a 6th man, so it wasn't my idea."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,chingt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"Early has improved. Will be a decent backup.   Phil still likes Calderons ball handling and thinking. Still, grant will take some of his minutes.  Gallo had a weird summer, but that's all it is-summer league. Has to pass more efficiently."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,4waves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:38 2015 UTC,"Melo knees favor posting up versus perimeter defense. Why not play him at the 4, and let Williams play maybe the 3 or Early?  I just think if we are thinking about melos health, the four is the better spot for him. Early has improved. I like the guards though. As weird as gallo was, him and grant playing g defense sounds good."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,4waves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:47 2015 UTC,This...   that's all it is-summer league   applies equally to this:   Early has improved. Will be a decent backup.
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,chingt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"You don't think Early could play minutes in this league?  Summer league is summer league. Improvement is improvement.   Some players are looking for a roster spot so they're over playing. Gallo is overplaying, underpassing.   Is is clear that early is playing better basketball and has sized up."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,4waves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can judge improvement from summer league, like you said. Early showed a lot of the same strengths and weaknesses as Hardaway -- loves to shoot and is able to beat disorganized summer league defenses for easy points and to put up big scoring by taking lots of shots, but still unimpressive at the effort stuff like defense, rebounding, passing. He still didn't look capable of actually creating shots either due to mediocre ball handling and a so/so first step. Most of his points were opportunistic."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,chingt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"hardaway- Hard to compare the two. Two different positions.   Hardaway couldn't shoot all that well, didn't play defense, and bball IQ wasn't that high.   Early showed a better handle, increased size(which was where a lot of his problems stemmed from) and better IQ. Better passing as well.   I think he can back up people at the 3."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,4waves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"he might be able to although I'm not sure I agree with your evaluation. My main point was it wasn't fair for you to discount Galloway's poor summer league as ""just summer league"" and then to declare Early as ready for the rotation based on ""just summer league""."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,chingt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"You're right there. That thought didn't make sense.   I think this whole thread was on board with the fact that Early has progressed, even if it's a little. Why didn't he impress last season?Because he was undersized and injured. He is now sized and that should decrease his injury rate ."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,4waves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:45 2015 UTC,"Melo defends a lot better at the 4. Give melo the four, O quinn backup at both 4 and 5. Until Zinger bulks up, he will struggle at the four/five.   O quinn is ready to play bigger minute. He was a great signing."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,4waves,4,Mon Jul 20 15:30:42 2015 UTC,porz much too slow to play at the 3.
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,jrg114,0,Sat Jul 18 13:40:38 2015 UTC,"I see people say the same about Melo, though. The two will share the floor at the 3/4 for at least 8min a game, so who's best guarding the 3?"
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,cordlc,6,Sat Jul 18 13:48:59 2015 UTC,...carmelo definitely
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,E-Miles,2,Sat Jul 18 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"Porzingis is way weaker than Melo in terms of strength, though. He'd get bullied worse by bigger 4's, I think.  Dunno, I feel like if Zingis gets better on D over time, he'd be fine against smaller guys. His length alone can cover much of the speed issue, as long as he plays smart. Either way, there's often gonna be a strength or speed issue until he matures."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,cordlc,2,Sat Jul 18 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"But he's got a 7'6"" wingspan. He stands and his arms reach the rim. Did you watch him on Okafor? Yeah he got pushed around but he put a wall up in front of him"
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,Schildkrotes,2,Sat Jul 18 15:27:35 2015 UTC,do you see kristaps being able to keep up with paul george or joe johnson though? much better to have him down low and let him just go straight up.
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,E-Miles,2,Sat Jul 18 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, does Joe Johnson play the 3? Assumed he was always the 2 and Brooklyn played big, but I don't watch him much.  Funny thing with Paul George, is that thing with Larry Bird saying he might play the 4. So he might be stuck guarding him anyway!"
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,cordlc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:16:42 2015 UTC,who would play the 3 on the pacers??
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,E-Miles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"Still early though. I think we can expect the 'weak' thing to get better as this season progresses. He's already put on 20-30 pounds since he was drafted. It's also just a waste to put a guy who's 7'3 on the wing. Even if he can't rebound, he is a pretty good shotblocker."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,MattPH1218,2,Sat Jul 18 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"Porzingod would get murdered on D. You need him in the paint to block shots. That's why it's increasingly likely that he'll play backup to Lopez.  I'm not sure that Fisher has decided the starting lineup yet, but I think they'll be starting O'Quinn at PF. O'Quinn is probably the best choice purely for winning, since he averages about 8 pts 8 reb 1.5 blocks per 36. Porzingis may consider himself a natural PF, but I can almost guarantee you that Phil Jackson wants to develop him as a center after personally witnessing the 7 foot disaster that was Andrea Bargnani.  Someone mentioned that the triangle is double high post tho, which means you want Melo at PF. So maybe O'Quinn would play 3? That's less out of position than a 7'3"" guy at 3."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,Jmrwacko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"Zinger is better at the 4 because he can still use his length to block shots but he won't have the deal with the really big Centers.

NYKnicks,3dqh0z,Irreversible_Rape,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, can't see Zinger at the 5 until mid season+.   Huge potential and will probably reach it, but not big enough to hang with the fives of todays game."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,4waves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"There's no way you can put someone 7'3 at the 3. He will be matched up against people running up and down the court which will tire him out fast. He won't be able to guard the 3 point line and be quick enough to stop penetration, plus you want his rim protection to be at the 4"

NYKnicks,3dqh0z,Irreversible_Rape,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"He also has really good handles and mobility for someone so tall. Porzingis doesn't have handles like him, and more likely never will, and on defense he probably won't be able to guard wing players because laterally he won't be fast enough. These aren't slightly on Porzingis, he's just not as fluid and mobile as people on this site think he is, and his potential isn't being able to play the wing on either side of the ball, it's probably closer to Anthony Davis than Kevin Durant."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,sensualfly,2,Sat Jul 18 15:35:34 2015 UTC,He seems pretty mobile compared to other seven footers in the league.
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,suckerNYKfan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:19:39 2015 UTC,this would require kristaps to handle the ball far too much on the perimeter and would require way too much passing from him.   it'd probably be better to bring kristaps off the bench with oquinn.

NYKnicks,3dqh0z,E-Miles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"This is less than ideal. First, Melo is at the latter part of his prime. The four is incredibly taxing on the body, and if the Knicks want the most out of him he is best fit at the three. Also, Zing would be a disaster at the three in terms of defense. Melo 3, zing 4 would be the ideal situation."

On offense Melo will be more in the post. On defense however Kristaps clearly should be guarding bigger dudes than Melo"
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,iamslm22,2,Sat Jul 18 13:44:02 2015 UTC,That is untrue in any offence but especially the triangle.  The 4 and 5 are the double high post that make up the basis of the triangle.
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,partipo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:55:55 2015 UTC,"Agree. I see Melo doing a lot more time at the SF, cutting and getting open for easy shots. His advantage at the 4 is his footwork and agility. He drags big men out to no-man's-land, then blitzes by them, or makes them dance. Leaving him in the post feels like a waste."
NYKnicks,3dqh0z,muhshisuh,0,Sat Jul 18 14:45:17 2015 UTC,let's not get ahead of ourselves.  we aren't starting the rookie this year unless injuries occur.  unfortunately derrick williams will probably start at the 3 and 4 with melo interchangebly.

NYKnicks,3doz45,iamslm22,15,Sat Jul 18 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"Kristaps Porzingis reminds me of ... a unicorn  There’s no one even remotely similar to Porzingis. The description of his game almost sounds like make-believe.  The Knicks rookie is 7-foot-2, but he’s capable of running off screens to fire up quick-release jumpers immediately after the catch. By way of his length, he’ll also protect the rim just by being there. It's a combination we’ve really never seen.  Many will say he resembles Dirk Nowitzki, or Andrea Bargnani, depending on what side of the fence they’re on when it comes to Porzingis, but those comparisons for the Latvian big man are far off. Nowitzki posts up and hits impossible off-balance fadeaways, but Porzingis looks more like a giant J.J. Redick, flashing to open areas, staying square and releasing a buttery jumper with near-perfect form.  Porzingis seriously lacks strength and will definitely get pushed around, but he’ll also outrun opposing big men and stress out the types who like to hang back in the paint and protect the rim. Nowitzki survived defensively by becoming great at stripping the ball from opponents, but Porzingis can have a much more substantial impact when it comes to altering shots. He’s a different animal."
NYKnicks,3doz45,Schildkrotes,17,Sat Jul 18 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"This one is really interesting to me, because I really haven't been able to think of anyone Porzingis reminds me of. He has potential to be very good on both sides of the ball, so I'm very curious, but the rebounding does worry."
NYKnicks,3doz45,c_c_combo,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:53:28 2015 UTC,I think that's the beauty of him. We will be comparing people to him in a few decades. He will be part of the Magic/MJ/LeBron/?/Wilt club. Porzingod will fill the question mark as hands down the greatest Power Forward ever to play the game!  Edit: Why so serious?
NYKnicks,3doz45,the_furry_stoner,3,Sat Jul 18 02:32:40 2015 UTC,Better than Duncan  That is pretty fuckin good
NYKnicks,3doz45,staycruzin,5,Sat Jul 18 04:06:54 2015 UTC,"I loved it. Truly someone who is just a unique player. Dirk was a shooter but like the article said, Porz isn't a back to the basket fade away guy. I would take Dirk 10/10 over Porzingis in a 3 pts contest. However, he can shoot over absolutely anyone and that mid range should be open all the time. He's quick enough to get by a lot of 4s and 5s so if they do come out to cover him, he can get by them and to the basket. I like Porzingis. I mean, at the very least he is very exciting for us fans. That alone makes me like him. I want to see how he does against elite NBA competition as well as how he can play with Melo. Let's not forget, it's still his team. Or at least he thinks so and will act so. I believe Melo isn't a selfish player like he's portrayed in the media and throughout the NBA fan base. I think he knows when he should be taking over and when he should be passing. He hasn't really had much talent consistently around him to take some pressure off him. I'm interested to see if Porzingis, Galloway, Grant, Afflalo, and Lopez can at least make enough of an impact that Melo doesn't have to break his back trying to carry us."

NYKnicks,3doz45,Joshy_Andy_50,9,Sat Jul 18 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"Jerian Grant reminds me of ... Jrue Holiday  Grant and Holiday ended up falling outside of the lottery after their collegiate careers, but it's not hard to envision a scenario where Grant is an immediate contributor like Holiday was as a rookie.  The two point guards are more similar in their skills than their style, but both are capable distributors out of the pick-and-roll and particularly adept at finding the balance between probing a defense and not getting stuck in the trees. Both are a little shy of 6-foot-5, and the height clearly helps with their court vision.  The outside shooting touch is almost as important, especially since Grant will be spending time in the triangle offense, which de-emphasizes dribbling. Holiday has made a seamless transition to being a spot-up threat next to a high-usage player like Anthony Davis, and Grant will need to do the same with Carmelo Anthony hogging possessions.  There might not be superstar potential present, but Grant’s nearly identical skill-set to Holiday should enable him to become a solid point guard who doesn’t take anything off the table."

Yes he will have a trying transitional period. But I think you're glossing over how ""decent"" he actually ways. I find that there are two ways to grade talent in the NBA. Obviously the most concrete is production and stats. and the second is what you see/feel. He did well on both ends. The dude moves like no other for his size, his instincts are natural, his shooting stroke is pure, his competiiveness is real. This kid is going to be the real deal. I don't think a lot of us can say anything about how Fish will do as a coach. This year is the real test. The only thing I can say about him is that he has always been known to be one of the smarter guys on the team, and Phil and Kobe trusted him implictely during their title runs. I like that. I love Clyde. Last night, his line about Ndour ""He's either erratic or dramatic"" was pure gold. He will forever be the best. Robin Lopez should have a good year. SHOULD. it's hard to say ""east is easier = better year"" sometimes flukey shit happen. But yes, he SHOULD do very well. Who knows what Oquinn will do. He has all the tools and now the minutes to do great, but it's up to him. Grant will definitely be a productive NBA guard. he will need to adjust more than you think. Kemba is stilla adjusting. Kyrie is still adjusting. John Wall took 3ish years to truly blossom. i think we can win 30 games give or take 5."

So I disagree with you about it not being very important"
NYKnicks,3dr5fx,Vanchat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:44:45 2015 UTC,"An important thing about Porzingis is his attitude seems to be really positive and he seems (at least now) like the kind of no-bullshit guy that will do stuff like work his ass off to improve his game.  As long as he keeps that I'd be fine with him being mediocre his first year. He's got the tools, just might take some time."
NYKnicks,3dr5fx,maccam21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:05:05 2015 UTC,He's a young rookie. He'll struggle year 1 either way
NYKnicks,3dr5fx,Vanchat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:39 2015 UTC,"I think he will add some things. The big thing with his game is that he needs to add size. That can happen over time.   I think when that happens, he will get better. He will be just decent this year, but down the line he has the chance to be a real player. That is what we're hoping for. Great kid as well."
NYKnicks,3dr5fx,maccam21,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:20:27 2015 UTC,If we compare ourselves to other teams we are realistically speaking 6th-8th optimism is 5th

NYKnicks,3dn201,ch-dev,3,Fri Jul 17 17:32:56 2015 UTC,Some books have Grant +2500 for rookie of the year. Pretty tempting.

NYKnicks,3ds0cb,ejayshun,17,Sat Jul 18 22:08:37 2015 UTC,They say stars dont get called for travel sooo  porzi= already a star
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,ballerdjballer,10,Sat Jul 18 23:22:25 2015 UTC,"In the nba, its not a travel if its in a fast break. The refs just let it go to let the game run. I've seen plenty of players travel in a fast brak"
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,SillentStriker,2,Sat Jul 18 22:56:28 2015 UTC,Superstar calls already granted upon him :D
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,jaimmieoh,2,Sun Jul 19 06:18:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a travel, but refs (at any level) never call those on wide open fast breaks unless it's completely ridiculous, and even then, there have been cases where they let it go (Lou Amundsen....)"
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,hjdeggers,3,Sun Jul 19 14:48:42 2015 UTC,Everyone does that
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,xarziv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"He was gathering the ball up until he took his two steps, according to NBA officials that isn't a travel."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,WhiteMichael,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:27:01 2015 UTC,travels aren't called
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,hashtaghypebeast,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"this is my biggest peeve, this CLEARLY is NOT a travel. he was gathering the ball in his hands while taking step number 1. then took 2 more after the gather, in the rule book this IS NOT A TRAVEL. refs are not just letting calls go.... a travel is blatant/purposeful over stepping. Similar to the playing the ball rule in football, accidental contact is sometimes not called if you do everything right."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,TriZTroCiTy,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:55:01 2015 UTC,Please show me where the rule book says this.
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,hjdeggers,-2,Sun Jul 19 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"Dude, it clearly is a travel just stop. From the time the ball hits the court to the time Zingis get the ball in both hands he takes 2 steps.. okay so those 2 steps are his gather?  Fine, he still takes 3 steps after that, its a travel no matter how you slice it"
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,Irreversible_Rape,0,Sun Jul 19 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"its not really a travel, not even in the strictes possible way. you cant travel while the ball is still being dribbled. it is really only the last 2 steps that would be off dribble. thats when he collects the ball and sets off for the dunk, the other ones arent made before the dribble is finished. its not 2 steps for every time the ball hits the floor, its 2 steps after the ball is collected."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,nittun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. If that was true, I could dribble, take 15 steps downcourt, dribble again and that's not a travel.  He takes at least four steps here, it doesn't matter if he was ""collecting the ball"" or not, he didn't dribble again so every step he takes after picking up his dribble counts:  http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_10.html  Again, they don't usually call these on fast breaks, but technically by the rules this is a travel."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,hjdeggers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"again no one calls it because its not really the right wait to understand the rule, the dribble is not over as soon as the ball hits the floor."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,nittun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"Read the link I sent. The ""right"" way to understand the rule is that, once a player picks up the ball and doesn't dribble again, the dribble is over.  In order for the dribble to continue, the player must actually keep dribbling. Just because he is holding the ball in one hand doesn't mean he's still dribbling."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,hjdeggers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:48:22 2015 UTC,"again, you are contradicting yourself. first and second claim doesnt match."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,nittun,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"What? I literally said the same thing haha. The dribble ends when he stops dribble, no matter what hand he's holding it in. There is no ""collecting steps"" or ""gathering""--those still count as steps taken. If the game was on the line and that play was a game-winner, and the refs looked at the instant-replay, it would be a travel.  Read the link I sent of the official rules."
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,hjdeggers,-3,Sun Jul 19 16:44:45 2015 UTC,it's definitely a travel he took about 5 or 6 steps. don't get used to it because the refs will call it.
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,MrTape,5,Sat Jul 18 23:30:44 2015 UTC,They probably won't..
NYKnicks,3ds0cb,Schildkrotes,2,Sun Jul 19 02:17:50 2015 UTC,... travels are never called on wide open fastbreaks
NYKnicks,3dom4y,AncientCaptain,13,Fri Jul 17 23:51:06 2015 UTC,I think the Dalembert boat has sailed...
NYKnicks,3dom4y,Schildkrotes,4,Sat Jul 18 01:31:51 2015 UTC,thank god for that!
NYKnicks,3dom4y,shinybling,8,Sat Jul 18 07:17:53 2015 UTC,Everyone is predicting we start 2 rookies but I highly doubt even one gets the call on opening night. To me there's 0% chance we start both of them.
NYKnicks,3dom4y,nyalriv580,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"I think there is a 100% chance that Porzingis does not start opening night. I think it's a little closer to 25% chance Grant does. If he really kills it in camp, they may give him the nod. I still think Jose will get the go though."
NYKnicks,3dom4y,Schildkrotes,6,Sat Jul 18 18:04:59 2015 UTC,PG - Grant - Calderon - Andre Miller  SG - Afflalo - Galloway - Antetokounmpo  SF - Melo - Williams - Early   PF - Porzingis - Ndour - Thomas  C - Lopez - O'Quinn - Amundson  Maybe?
NYKnicks,3dom4y,btopishere,11,Sat Jul 18 00:23:29 2015 UTC,Derrick Williams at the 3? please no.
NYKnicks,3dom4y,Slyric_,0,Sat Jul 18 01:39:44 2015 UTC,What else would he play? Pretty sure he's a 3.
NYKnicks,3dom4y,therealjgreens,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"He's played the 4, but I think he needs a change of scenery."
NYKnicks,3dom4y,Schildkrotes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:41 2015 UTC,Didnt he play the 4 in small ball lineups? I suppose we could try that but it would have to be where he matches up with someone he might be able to defend at the 4. It's a short list.  He's still only 24 and looked great at the end of last season (on offense).
NYKnicks,3dom4y,therealjgreens,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:50:25 2015 UTC,I think a lot of where everyone plays will have to do with match ups. I hope that Fisher incorporated this kind of stuff into his coaching game because it can make a huge difference.
NYKnicks,3dom4y,Schildkrotes,2,Sat Jul 18 16:01:27 2015 UTC,Yea playing matchups is HUGE

NYKnicks,3dom4y,nuclearfatty,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with bringing Nate back. We really need a second scorer and while Grant seems like the closest to that role, a vet may be a better choice until he's more experienced."
NYKnicks,3dom4y,bananashotgun33,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:38 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why everyone has grant starting over Calderon.  You saw the way he played against the Warriors and the rest of summer league he clearly isn't ready to start over Calderon yet.

So for the draft they just listed him as his Euro height.   But for the NBA the listed height is height in shoes. And they add about 2"" so when he's playing he's about 7'2.5"" and I guess they  round up in that scenario.   edit: After a little extra research it looks like only 1.25-1.5 inches are added from barefoot and that Zinger was actually measured at 7'0.25"""

NYKnicks,3dlpgm,hugepnus,5,Fri Jul 17 12:49:04 2015 UTC,"Smooth, smooth stroke.   It's inevitably going to be compared to Dirk's. I think he has a lower release point, but a slightly quicker release. Less arc, but still very hard to guard.   He needs to spend an entire offseason getting stronger and working on the turn around, step-back that Dirk mastered. With his length it would be pretty much impossible to defend."

NYKnicks,3dmr40,violynce,58,Fri Jul 17 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Because he's 19 and it's too early to nitpick his game apart.   First of all, you're comparing him to two true centers. Porzingis was not drafted to play the 5, he is only doing so in summer league.   Second of all, he's 19. He can't get inside and utilize his length because he's too skinny/weak right now, which is something everyone is and has been aware of.   Let's revisit the issue when he's had a full season of playing time under his belt. If during his age 21 and 22 seasons he's still averaging 5.5 per 36 like Bargnani did, then we can reasonably conclude that he might never develop into a good rebounder.   Even in that case, it would be too early to declare him a value-less player based on one facet of his game.   If you want to compare him to a more successful European, Dirk averaged only 6.1 and 6.5 per 36, respectively, in his first two full seasons.  In sum, it's way too early to know how the fuck Kristaps is going to develop. People need to relax and enjoy the ride, for better or worse."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,JC915,38,Fri Jul 17 15:21:22 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, if you watch the summer league games, you'll see him doing a hell of a job for his size boxing out the opposing center and then someone else grabs the rebound. Its not as simple as numbers. The kid is working his ass off."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,Icecat77,6,Fri Jul 17 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"Mentioned this below but Im guessing its the coaching staff telling him to do this. He didnt box out at ALL while playing overseas, so im guessing its a step-by-step process starting with learning how to effectively box out."

NYKnicks,3dmr40,ynksjts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:57:41 2015 UTC,And don't forget his hip might be still bothering him a bit.
NYKnicks,3dmr40,big_brother_cheng,11,Fri Jul 17 18:07:12 2015 UTC,If he becomes an efficient enough scorer it might make up for the fact that he is essentially a small forward. Hes also out of position; playing next to Robin Lopez and O'Quinn during the season may make it easier for him to boost his stats with a couple more boards.
NYKnicks,3dmr40,44lennox,7,Fri Jul 17 15:46:46 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt he will play with 2 true bigs during the season, that would leave him (or KOQ) defending a wing player and they just can't do that (I'm assuming for O'Quinn, never've watch him much).  On the rebounding I don't think it's a cause of concern yet because -dude- three summer league games are no sample size. That being said I do see slow hands on him, like a few rebounds that he didn't get not because he was out husseled or taken out of position, but because they just flew besides him before he could get his hands up.  Is that something you can learn/develop? (having quicker hands on rebounds) I don't know, but I assume that with hours in the gym and a strong work ethic everything is solvable, and the kid clearly has that ethic.  Also, I don't think that being a good rebounder is negligible for him. His greatest asset is going to be being able to creates mismatches on offense with big guys on the perimiter and then holding his own on D with his size/verticality. If he can't rebound then that's a big issue. But of course, there's a long way to go, still.  What I'm taking from this SL on Zinger is that he has a strong work ethic, he can be a plus defender on the NBA -mainly because he is so big and smart- and that the dude is athletic like, truly athletic. I never expected that and it's what has me more excited. On offense he is as advertised, a smooth J plus some ability to put the ball on the floor, which is also awesome.   The negatives that I saw are his slow hands on D, lack of rebounding for his size (I hope he can fix that) and the fact that he need to put on the hours in the weight room. Not just for positioning down low on offense and defense, but because he clearly gasses after a couple of quarters.   All in all I'm super happy with the kid, and I hope he exemplifies the new Phil Jackson era in New York, with strong work ethic, some humility and basketball wise an all around game that takes defense as seriously as offense (a priority for Phill according to an interview)"
NYKnicks,3dmr40,E-Miles,3,Fri Jul 17 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"i don't think he's essentially small forward. watching him and bargnani, the comparisons are so off. he's a big man that can shoot, but he definitely plays like a big man. he's not trying to cross his opponents. he's trying to bang inside. he tries to minimize his dribbles and he sets great screens."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,big_brother_cheng,3,Fri Jul 17 18:53:02 2015 UTC,There were a couple rebounds in the game where his first instinct was to dribble. Bargnani is rightfully a bad name around here but if we got 2010 production from Porzingis with Melo and Lopez healthy it would be ideal.
NYKnicks,3dmr40,RiceOnTheRun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"I personally dont think he hits 20/10 this season. Maybe something along the lines of 18ish points, but nothing close in rebounds.

NYKnicks,3dmr40,huhwhatweird,3,Sat Jul 18 15:45:11 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one around here who wants poringis to develop into a stretch 4 instead of just another big? Guys who can rebound in this league are a dime a dozen, there a aren't many athletic, 3 balling, 7-2 guys... One of the main reasons all the great shooters don't have big muscles is because it counteracts the muscle memory of shooting. If the zinger wants to stay skinny and work on his his shot, I say we embrace it. And god damn it, give it time."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,peterg300,5,Fri Jul 17 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"He's a bit outmatched at C right now in SL, he's not strong enough yet to maintain rebounding position. I also believe shifting him to PF will help his rebounding numbers as he won't be tasked with the expectation of banging with the biggest dude on the court. That being said, rebounding is an interesting stat. How do you quantify his ability to deny his man the rebound so that someone else on our team gets it? There is an interesting article on Robin Lopez doing that exact thing and how he inflates the rebounding numbers of those around him. I'd love to see a similar study done on KP once he gets a full season under his belt."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,agentohoolahan,3,Fri Jul 17 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Brook Lopez does the same thing as well, so I wouldn't be shocked to see KP grab maybe 7 a game once he's playing the 4 for you guys. The Lopez brothers are pretty good at setting the rest of the team up to grab boards."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,Nicholas82,6,Fri Jul 17 16:07:21 2015 UTC,"Because he does a sexy job of boxing out his man and gets the hockey assist rebound a lot of times, for which they have no stat, thus creating the illusion that he is not contributing to our rebounds when he actually is.  If you watched the summer league games, on a whole lot of possessions he'd clear out a lot of space by boxing out his man into the depths of hell so that one of our other guys could then secure the rebound.  Again, PorzinGAWD doesn't get a stat for that but it was sexy to watch and a reason why you shoudln't allow the stats in the box score to make you worry too much about his rebounding.  But certainly there were a lot of times where he just didn't beast the ball away from people to secure the rebound for himself.  But I'm sure he'll improve in that area.  I'm not that concerned."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,MyGodItsFullofStars,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:18 2015 UTC,"Its also worth mentioning that he did NOT do this well in the ACB. So i would guess that they have him working on his rebounding in very deliberate fashion, one piece at a time. Step 1 - box the fuck out."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,cyph3x,2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yup - defensively focused on boxing out, offensively focused on posting up, just for the sake of in-game reps.  A very good sign. They (and Kris) recognize his weaknesses and are making a conscious effort to change them right off the bat. Good sign for his development and how the coaching staff will help him in that regard"
NYKnicks,3dmr40,waya5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"RoLo is also a guy who does an excellent job boxing out and let's other front court guys grab the rebound. He led the league in highest proportion of contested d-rebounds while Aldridge was in the top 5 of highest proportion of uncontested d-rebounds.   After seeing Porzingis doing a good job with putting a body on his man, and RoLo's reputation for the same thing, I think Carmelo will have a career season in terms of rebounds."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,RiceOnTheRun,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly I can see Melo doing well in points as well. If healthy, I think he goes for somewhere between 25-30ppg. Add maybe like 7-8 rebounds if he does as insane as you think and that'd be pretty awesome."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,lians60,2,Sat Jul 18 07:01:21 2015 UTC,He's not a power rebounder. Neither was Dirk.  98-99: 3.4 in 20 min  99-00: 6.5 in 36 min
NYKnicks,3dmr40,nittun,2,Fri Jul 17 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"First off, he is not a pure block player like the other 2. he spends a lot more time arround the arc than the other 2. he is 19, but honestly he shows a lot of hustle thats assuring of his future development. lets try and compare apples to apples instead what do we really expect of porzingis? its sure as hell not a deandre jordan.   Ryan anderson is a pretty good yard pole in my oppinion. at least for rebounds. can he grab 10? yes does he? not too often. i think we should be pleased if he get up to a neighborhood of 8.5-10 rebounds per 36. thats honestly not bad for a stretch player. he is not there yet but its really not something i would worry too much about."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,ch-dev,3,Fri Jul 17 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be concerned because that's not his game. He's tall, but that doesn't mean he plays like a typical big,... which is what makes him unique. If we were planning to use him as a center, then yes, we should all be concerned.  Kevin Durant averaged 3.5 rebounds per game in his rookie season. He has averaged 6.1 for his career. In no way am I saying Porzingis will turn into Kevin Durant, but if we're expecting Porzingis to play more of a Kevin Durant style of basketball, then 5-6 rebounds per game should be what we should expect."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,Irreversible_Rape,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:48:07 2015 UTC,"You should be worried but at least last game he did a good job boxing out.

But most importantly, the kid is doing nearly everything very good to great; obviously there is going to be one thing he struggles with. You can point to a player who does everything very well and claim to ""worry"" about that one thing that is his weekness.    Even if he never becomes a big time rebounder, if he can get up to 8-9 eventually that will be solid."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,kej718,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:42 2015 UTC,"You guys can't praise him when he does something right and not accept criticism when he does something wrong. It will get better as he gets stronger. Don't just look at the stats at the end of the game though. It doesn't tell the whole story. Sometimes he boxes out well and that allows the guards to get some boards. A lot of times he gets pushed out of position.   As long as he boxes out then I'm good. That is why N'Dour should make the team, he ge5s us boards on the both ends of the court."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,AlphakirA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:59:18 2015 UTC,"What creates rebounds is good defense and effort and Porzingis seems to have quite a bit of both. With a few more pounds he'll be much better at boxing out since the energy is already there.   And I'm not at all saying rebounding doesn't matter, because it's obviously important...but the team with the 3rd worst rebounding last year won 60 games. Cleveland made the finals being the 18th best rebounding team. I'd rather have a motivated player that doesn't seem to have a peer in his skillset and size than one that's more par for the course and can rebound well."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,mi0003,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:52 2015 UTC,"He's playing C in Summer League out of necessity, but likely playing PF in regular season until he bulks up."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,Fuckcreating,-2,Fri Jul 17 15:11:07 2015 UTC,Shouldn't that mean he would be getting more opportunities to grab rebounds if he's operating closer to the rim?
NYKnicks,3dmr40,Dovahklutch,3,Fri Jul 17 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"Rebounding is more about positioning and instinct and less about size.  Now if you have both positioning and instinct and are tall, grabbing rebounds becomes a lot easier.    Porzingus doesn't have the defensive rebounding positioning down yet.  He looks like he's smart enough to get into those positions but he doesn't have the strength or experience to assert himself down there now.  He'll get there."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,sailboat_explosion,2,Fri Jul 17 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"No, because he's too skinny to properly box out other centers. Dude is gonna take some time to reach his potential."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,John_YJKR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:58 2015 UTC,Yes. But like others have said. He's not really used to playing center and he's a skinny 19 year old. They want him to add 30 lbs. When he does he should be able to play the position more aggressive and get better results.
NYKnicks,3dmr40,mi0003,0,Fri Jul 17 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Everyone knows his muscle/strength is a weakness, and will continue to be until he bulks up. He is only 19, and it's very early. He is not a true C yet because of it, thus why he is being out-rebounded."
NYKnicks,3dmr40,Fuckcreating,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"I think this is a pretty valid concern, for as much as everyone loves him and wants him to be NY's saviour it doesn't mean he has to great at everything, everyone has their weaknesses. That being said rebounds is pretty much the only stat that can been seen to translate between different levels of competition. I doubt he becomes an above average rebounder for his position but it's not his rebounding ability that got him drafted."

NYKnicks,3dmr40,AlphakirA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:11:47 2015 UTC,"Body type and place of origin (not even close to a similar country) do not have anything to do with how they play. Porzingis is extremely athletic and can defend well, Bargnani is the antithesis of athletic, can't defend well, and is 3 inches shorter. To compare, Bargnani is just as close to the height of Melo as he is to Porzingis. Melo is an offensive minded player like Bargnani. Would you say they're compatible? Of course not. It's basically just xenophobia that's making people compare the two and it's ridiculous if you take a minute to actually watch how they play. And Porzingis isn't a poor rebounder, he's a guy that plays from the outside therefore doesn't rebound, there's a difference whereas Bargnani simply put little effort into it."

NYKnicks,3dmr40,bkay28,0,Fri Jul 17 18:00:49 2015 UTC,He's also fine with boxing out and letting his teammates get the board. When he does go up for one he's fighting with his own team for the board because it's summer league and every one is trying to pad stats

NYKnicks,3dnoo9,bkay28,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:09 2015 UTC,You do realize anyone can start a pod cast?
NYKnicks,3dnoo9,mysteryi,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:22 2015 UTC,"Hi I listen to them whenever we have some Knick news going around. They are most likely just friends who loves the Knicks as much as we do. They share some insight but honestly they will have more or less the same knowledge any smart Knicks fan will have. I do keep up to date with the podcast thru out my commute, which hey you should give a try, especially some older ones."

NYKnicks,3dlcjr,CrimsonToaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:01:25 2015 UTC,His length is ridiculous. The way he's able to just reach out and stop the shot is awesome.  Edit: Nice to see he went straight up too. He needs to learn that he's so damn long that he doesn't need to bring the arms down and invite the foul call. His reach alone is enough to bother most of the 4's he'll be guarding.

NYKnicks,3djtv7,justafIeshwound,41,Thu Jul 16 21:31:02 2015 UTC,I stopped reading at Brook Lopez... Which is the first player he listed
NYKnicks,3djtv7,Darktroop6,11,Thu Jul 16 21:34:22 2015 UTC,marcus fucking smart was second...
NYKnicks,3djtv7,Big-Law,3,Fri Jul 17 03:13:10 2015 UTC,That's a about when the milk started shooting out my nose.
NYKnicks,3djtv7,mersh547,26,Fri Jul 17 13:25:57 2015 UTC,I don't think this guy has ever watched Melo play...
NYKnicks,3djtv7,moec51,23,Thu Jul 16 21:56:54 2015 UTC,I don't think he's watched half of the guys he listed play either.  Fuck outta here with that list.
NYKnicks,3djtv7,lRushdown,26,Thu Jul 16 22:05:53 2015 UTC,"He called Rondo a chemistry, team first player, he clearly doesn't watch the NBA."
NYKnicks,3djtv7,azizinator25,17,Thu Jul 16 23:10:41 2015 UTC,Anyone else feel like its just him being on the Knicks that makes everyone want to put him down? The Knicks stigma is cast upon Carmelo Anthony is peoples minds for some reason. Either theyre butthurt he stayed or they just associate Knicks=bad so melo=bad.
NYKnicks,3djtv7,shane727,16,Thu Jul 16 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"Yes. I once saw someone list 100 players ""better"" than Ewing, in the same vein as what this guy did.  Among the players ""better"" than Ewing were Klay Thompson, Muggsy Bouges, and Shawn Kemp.  Sad thing is dude was at like +15 rather than this scrub who is rightfully at -45.  The reason why he listed 100 players better than Ewing is because he said ""The Knicks are a scrub franchise that should be disbanded. They've been the worst team in the NBA for most of their history and have never had someone who was even close to a top 100 player"".  Of course when people started saying things like ""You do know Patrick Ewing exists, right?"" he said he could easily name 100 players better than Ewing.  Thus came the list."
NYKnicks,3djtv7,azizinator25,11,Thu Jul 16 23:10:03 2015 UTC,Lol what about Willis Reed and Clyde Fraizer?

Knicks have been bad for the most part since 2004, but they were always in the playoffs from the late 80s to the early 2000s.  I don't know whether that is New York Jealous (the knicks are a big market team that still gets attention even win they lose, even top 5 in attendance) or just jumping on the hate bandwagon."

NYKnicks,3djtv7,TreSeven,11,Thu Jul 16 22:36:07 2015 UTC,Stalked his comment history... he's a raptors fan. Doesnt surprise me much
NYKnicks,3djtv7,spwilson19,8,Thu Jul 16 22:21:20 2015 UTC,He also said he was die hard nuggets fan. So his hate for Melo makes sense
NYKnicks,3djtv7,biggjahn,6,Thu Jul 16 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty positive that dude just trolls. Especially after looking at his comment history, I'm just not sure there is anyone who is actually that stupid without having a severe mental handicap."
NYKnicks,3djtv7,whiskeyandtea,8,Thu Jul 16 22:47:33 2015 UTC,"The best part of that entire conversation is where he says Rondo is a great team player. I mean the guy has a reputation as a locker room cancer and was benched during the playoffs by the Mavs this year so they could play Raymobd Felton, who I'm shocked wasn't on this guy's list."
