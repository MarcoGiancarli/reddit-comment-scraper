eFreebies,3dzuhv,NerdEchoes,5,Tue Jul 21 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"In case you get one and plan on canceling it before you'd be charged, from the terms and agreements:  1.6. Cancellation of subscriptions  A subscription can be cancelled at any time by the customer. Since the subscription period lasts for 12 months and is automatically prolonged 30 days before the end of each 12-month period, a cancellation must be received by One.com 30 days before the 12-month subscription period, at the latest. The unused portion of any advance payment will not be refunded. If the cancellation is not sent to One.com in time, the customer is obliged to pay the subscription fee for the following 12-month period.  Cancellation is possible by contacting the One.com Support who via e-mail will send a link to cancellation of the subscription. The mail is sent to the e-mail address which is registered under the subscription's contact information. The customer must click the sent link and confirm the cancellation, by entering the password of the subscription. Cancellationcan also be done by sending a signed letter by mail or fax.  Example: If the subscription was ordered January 1st 2008 the subscription lasts until December 31st 2008. If the customer does not wish to continue the subscription for the following year (2009), the subscription must be cancelled before November 30, 2008.  When One.com has received a cancellation, the customer will automatically be given a notice of receipt, displayed on the front page of the customer's Control Panel. The customer will also receive a notice of receipt via e-mail regarding the cancellation from One.com. If the customer cannot see any such receipt on the front page of the One.com Control Panel within eight days he or she must send a new cancellation. If One.com chooses to terminate specific subscription types or special services, One.com may cancel a subscription with one month's notice. In such circumstances, the unused portion of any advance payment will of course be refunded. If One.com makes significant changes which depreciate the Terms and Conditions, customers shall be entitled to cancel their subscriptions with one month's notice. The unused portion of any advance payment will also, as an exception, be refunded. The subscription must in no way be used to gain unauthorised access to systems connected to the Internet. If any such activities or criminal acts come to the notice of One.com, regardless of the country the laws of which underlie the violation, the subscription will be immediately terminated and One.com reserves the right to pass on all relevant information to the relevant authorities. One.com also has the right to annul a subscription without notice with immediate effect and without compensation or reimbursement of any kind if the customer does not abide by these Terms and Conditions, if a party wastes or abuses resources available on the Internet, disrupts the functionality of the Internet, infringes netiquette valid at any given moment, e.g. by passing on information about other people's private affairs or in other ways inconveniencing other users of the Internet. Data from homepages and mail systems will generally be deleted seven days after termination of a subscription."

There's no way not to do this on signup for pogoplug. I do not know if you can later remove yourself from this mail list. It does not also give your email to 'advertising partners', so there shouldn't be additional spam from this. It's a free account version of a paid service. They're hoping people will like using it and pay money for more storage, and some features might be restricted to pay accounts or made to be so in the future.   I've also skimmed through the ToU agreements for pogoplug and CBSi, and it's all standard stuff for this type of service. No immediately concerning 'gotchas' there that I see, but like most ToU agreements it asserts the right to do assorted shittiness later on (usually that never happens, but still). If you've ever agreed to a EULA or signed up for pretty much anything online, you've agreed to the same sorts of stuff.  It may be worth noting that they have a pretty good DMCA policy."

To make this process as seamless as possible, we're offering our best deals ever to ensure that all of our users have unlimited storage and automatic backup for every device.

eFreebies,3czz3z,banned_accounts,7,Sun Jul 12 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"OpenOffice and LibreOffice come from the same codebase. OpenOffice was the first one, and it is open source. Sun Microsystems were the ones responsible for it. The problem was for many years, they allowed it to stagnate. Bugs that had been known for a long time weren't getting fixed, the codebase was large and bloated, etc. Well, then Sun gets bought by Oracle. If you thought Sun was bad, Oracle is easily 50X worse. This was the last straw for many people, who forked the code into LibreOffice. Oracle allowed it to stagnate more than Sun, and while they did eventually pass the reigns to the Apache Foundation, it was too little, too late, and now LibreOffice has many bugs fixed and a much slimmer codebase. Due to some updated license terms, many of these patches and changes cannot be put back to OpenOffice.  Most users should really just use LibreOffice. Oracle and Sun really allowed it to go to hell and it's unlikely it will ever recover."

It makes sense since adult site tracks for pay per view/click ads. I think some adult site forces you to allow cookies to store on your browser so that they may collect information on you. That's why when you visit some sites afterwards, the ads may cater to the type of fetishes you're interested in.   It's the same as going on an airfare website and looking up tickets. Those sites store the cookies and jack up the price a bit when you come back later to see if they can force you to purchase the tickets at a higher price. That's why it's recommended to clear your cookies/browser history every time you visit any airfare site."

eFreebies,3c5g3r,lazrbare,9,Sun Jul 5 00:24:42 2015 UTC,"DaVinci Resolve has been a very expensive color correction solution for almost 10 years. When Blackmagic bought the product it was announced that a Lite version was on the works. Only recently it was released (a few months ago), and a new version 12 is imminent.  I though it was a good time to let people know its existence, as many video professionals can not be aware that a free version of Resolve is available.  I apologize if this is redundant, and if any mod think so, he/she is free of deleting this post."

It's perhaps a little more complex, and the footage treatment can be a little more cumbersome (it's less indulgent with some video formats, but it supports a lot of raw camera footage).  Be aware that it is very system demanding, and if you don't have plenty of RAM it can crashes a lot of time."

You could set up your own license and offer it to filmmakers for a price. I completely understand that artists such as your self need to make money, but I'm always looking for affordable alternatives to music for my films. If you do a quick Google on royalty free music, you'll find a ton of sites that offer such licenses and you can get an idea of pricing. I think you can even sell your music to some of these sites who then license them for you, but I don't know how beneficial that would be for you as the artist.

eFreebies,3ad3bx,tgp1994,2,Fri Jun 19 04:14:38 2015 UTC,"Bitdefender review  I went forward and installed Bitdefender. Hours later, I've decided to uninstall it. I'm going to explain my reasons below.   Bloated   It includes anti-virus/anti-malware, a firewall thing, an optional proxy, an anti-spam (enabled by default), browser extensions, a wallet, a cloud storage service, a built-in browser... A lot of stuff. I don't want any proxy. I don't want any anti-spam (Gmail already handles that for me). I don't want browser extensions.  SafePay and Adobe Flash   It includes a ""secure"" browser. When opening it, it takes control of the entire screen. Right upon opening it for the first time, it complained about an outdated Adobe Flash plugin. Upon trying to install the update, it tried opening an HTTP page. I expected at least HTTPS. And I gave up while waiting for it. Some may find it secure, some may find it useful, but for me it's just bloat.  Wallet   It includes by default a ""wallet"", that supposedly can be used to store sensitive information (such as passwords). I disabled it. However, its process kept running in background and taking up 100% of one CPU core.  Horrible UI   In my opinion, a User Interface must be functional and predictable. It does not need to be pretty, it must just get the job done. Bitdefender UI is terrible. Maybe it only serves to look pretty at the screenshots, and nothing else. Custom UI elements sometimes were gray, sometimes were blue. I couldn't figure out which elements were in a disabled state and which were just gray because it was prettier. I ended up having to click on each element to find out if I could interact with it. Not intuitive at all. Confusing and without explanations. There were several items in the UI that I could not understand, mostly because they were names invented specifically by Bitdefender. There was no built-in help, no tooltips, nothing. Again, not intuitive. Clicking on some items would open a new window (with the same size and decoration as the main window), others would just change the main window contents and provide a ""back"" button. I never knew what would happen, and I never knew if I had to click ""close"" to go back, or to click ""back"". It was just unpredictable. Scan results window hides the actual file path until clicking on each ""threat"". The most important thing when deciding if a threat is actually a threat is to see the actual location of such threat. However, such vital info is hidden, requiring a click to show it in pop-up window. That's bad UI/UX design and painful to use. http://i.imgur.com/84TDSbr.png Fixed size tiny windows. All the windows have fixed sizes, with lots of padding and whitespace, and they are quite small. This is specially painful when looking at log results, or when deciding what actions to take after a scan. I have a 1080p screen, but it is impossible to fit the file path, the threat name, and the action in the tiny Bitdefender window. Frankly, this is just moronic. http://imgur.com/a/PaT35  Anti-virus   I did one full scan, but stopped it midway after 4 hours. It took a long while and the computer was pretty slow, but I believe that's expected. By default, it will delete files (and even files inside archives) without asking. It considered one plaintext file from GameFAQs as a threat, and moved it to quarantine. http://i.imgur.com/Z0CfM2L.png It deleted some cookies without asking. Sure, they were advertising cookies, but they are not a threat! This kind of behavior makes me worried about what kind of stuff it will delete without asking. It is impossible to read a partial log without stopping the scan. During the scan, I saw the counter of ""threats"" increasing, but there was no way to read what were the threats without first stopping the scan. Terrible UX here.  Windows Explorer   Bitdefender chose to hide all hidden and system files from Windows Explorer. Manually going to Folder Settings and selecting to show such files had no effect (other than crashing Explorer).    Conclusions  It is bloated and heavyweight. For advanced users, it has way more features than needed, and it gets in the way. For careless users, this might be a good thing.  It is quite intrusive, it can control and monitor everything.  The slowdown while scanning was bad, but certainly ""expected"", as it was very I/O intensive.  The UI was terrible. One of the worst I've used. I was angry about what it did automatically without askin (deleted/moved some files), but I was even more angry with the UI, that made it incredibly difficult to work with the software.  Are you an advanced user? Are you using a desktop computer inside a relatively ""safe"" environment (i.e. you are not using a laptop and connecting to several Wi-Fi networks)? Then Bitdefender is not for you. Otherwise, you may or may not like it. I didn't."

eFreebies,3ad3bx,denilsonsa,2,Fri Jun 19 11:39:06 2015 UTC,"I've seen this he every so often, so I figured ""what the hell, why not?""... And uninstalled it an hour later. While it is not bloated, it is pretty feature heavy. After installing I could not connect to Steam, and could not get back on Steam until disabling the firewall AND active virus scanning. This was on a same-day fresh install of Windows 10, so I doubt I had anything, left alone something to make Steam seem suspicious. And its not Windows 10, because I tried it on my Win 7 install and I had to do the same thing. After messing with that for a while, I ran into other issues and just gave up. Maybe if I felt like spending more time getting to learn to use it, I could get it set up the way I want it to, but... Meh."

I only post free books in sub-reddits that either allow them - or where the entire point of the sub-reddit is to share free e-books.  Yes - there are sub-reddits where normal posting is considered spamming and only posting free e-books is allowed.   I strongly limit the number of free e-books I share.

eFreebies,39lhij,staurozoa,108,Sat Jun 13 10:42:14 2015 UTC,"Ya, agreed. I think most of us came here looking for ""useful"" freebies like Bitdefender, Google Play albums, apps, games, etc. Now if the eBook offered was from a known author and provided some value, I wouldn't be opposed to it, but the vast majority of eBooks offered here are from unknown authors trying to advertise/boost their downloads for free.  Some of them even get shadow banned. This post made by /u/Tyler_Moore for example. Looking at the posting histories of some of these authors, the only thing they do here is self-promotion and have no intention of being part of any community."

We remove most spam quickly, but we do have lives outside the internet.  tl;dr: we already ban eBook spammers and if you see one, report them!"

New accounts aren't likely to be members of the community, and enough people already link to free Amazon apps, so this should be fairly good at catching new accounts spamming Amazon eBooks."
eFreebies,39lhij,banned_accounts,5,Sat Jun 13 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"Our filter is actually more strict than that. One of the ebook specific subs often helps spammers get enough votes to circumvent it, unfortunately."
eFreebies,39lhij,N1ghtshade3,2,Sat Jun 13 04:40:38 2015 UTC,"There was a reported eBook earlier from an account that was only a few hours old - shouldn't AM have caught that? I'm pretty sure account age isn't a factor right now if posts from new accounts are passing.  Or, AM could be set to automatically remove amazon.com posts after a certain number of reports.  Or, withhold all amazon.com links unless they're made by a pre-approved submitter. Mods would need to manually review the links before posting."
eFreebies,39lhij,banned_accounts,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"Account age isn't the only thing taken into account.  Automod also removes amazon (and any) posts after a certain number of reports (and lets us know if more than a couple people report it, first).  Blacklisting amazon to all but approved submitters is an option, but we'd like to avoid that if at all possible, since it'd likely keep non-authors (the people who tend to find higher quality ebooks) from posting.  Btw, do you have a link to the ""few hour old"" account's post? I think they were already shadowbanned."
eFreebies,39lhij,N1ghtshade3,2,Sat Jun 13 05:05:52 2015 UTC,"Someone removed it, but you can see it in /r/eFreebies/about/spam. The ban came after the post was made, so it stayed up though.  I think the fact that this thread has over 350 upvotes and tons of comments shows that this is an issue that needs to be addressed, and given the overall low votes for many eBooks, I don't think many people are happy to see the flood of low quality self-published eBooks being spammed by the authors.  I guess the easiest option would be to place stricter requirements on who can link to amazon.com?"
eFreebies,39lhij,frigginelvis,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:11:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, I was curious about where they had posted before our sub. It's too bad shadowbanning hides all that data.  And I agree.

Why do I care that some unknown app that should have been free anyway is now being given away because nobody was buying it?  I'd like it if we could simply filter out certain tags. Plenty of other subs have this feature and it would allow people to see what they want."

I'd rather they stay here, and they'll probably still be on our pages, but I never said fo sho what's happening with them.  As for blindly downvoting, it'd be a lot more helpful to downvote low quality posts and posts that ""you think [do] not contribute to the subreddit"" rather than downvoting just because of what it is.

I get that people want some sort of change, but I don't think going full nuclear is the best option.

eFreebies,39lhij,ReKonter,19,Sun Jun 14 01:43:32 2015 UTC,EFreebees are banned on /r/freebies because /r/efreebies exists. I think the same could be done with ebooks. I think /r/freeEBooks does a pretty good job of laying the books out and has an audience interested specifically in ebooks. Right now it seems redundant.

eFreebies,39lhij,alienomega,4,Fri Jun 12 17:01:16 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those self serving authors. Efreebies gives the largest amount of traffic of all the subs mentioned above. I always respond to comments and try to offer the best work possible. It's an on the table offer, if you're interested in my kids book, here it is, if not, thank you for your time. I understand that there are ""wantrapeneurs"" who are spamming, but reddit has become a powerful platform, it's going to attract attention. Is there a way we could address the numbers of submissions while still allowing eBooks to be submitted?"
eFreebies,39lhij,triksterx,27,Fri Jun 12 17:12:47 2015 UTC,"I think I speak for a number of people here when I saw we don't care about which subs bring the most traffic to you. We care about quality freebies that actually offer something of value, not on how much they benefit you.  You singlehandedly may not be spamming much, but together, it's a lot of nonsense spam.  I'll admit though, the fact that you actually take part in actual discussions makes you 10x better than people like /u/mrsspanko, who are obviously only here to spam their books."
eFreebies,39lhij,alienomega,11,Fri Jun 12 19:55:03 2015 UTC,I didn't read their comnent that way but rather that if there's a lot of traffic coming from this sub then doesn't it imply that quite a lot of people in the sub are interested in the ebooks?
eFreebies,39lhij,triksterx,11,Fri Jun 12 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"Never thought of it that way, but that's possible. The way he said ""self serving"", and calling it a ""powerful platform"" suggested to me he was interested in /r/eFreebies as a promotional platform."
eFreebies,39lhij,mrsspanko2,2,Fri Jun 12 20:29:30 2015 UTC,Funny how 2 people can read the same thing totally differently.

eFreebies,39lhij,mrsspanko2,4,Fri Jun 12 21:11:38 2015 UTC,I just wanted to thank you for commenting. I realized something about the way I was thinking about all this and I believe I see it from your perspective now. EFreebies has the right to ban anything it wishes.   It's stupid hard trying to get attention on the Internet and super scary to speak up. Thank you for listening.
eFreebies,39lhij,staurozoa,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:35:10 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to care what brings the most traffic, that comment was to show that it's hard to ignore the sub. Reddit is a conundrum in that you are praised for advertising other people and hated for bringing your own content up. I've bought advertising here multiple times. They have all ended poorly with either no comments or outright trolling.   What you are attempting to address is an unavoidable issue: if you want the wheat, you have to sift the chaff. Every other sub reddit I have been a part of has gone through this. Look at r/magictcg. They have splintered into so many sub reddits that there is virtually no substantive content left on the main hub. It's all art projects and controversy.   If you severely moderate the content, and continually restrict the definition of the sub, you will eventually cut off the flow of content. Say you get rid of eBooks but allow games. I guarantee you the spam app developers will smell blood and you will drown in candy crush clones. So you ban games and allow programs. Sourceforge will then flood.   Restriction kills subs."
eFreebies,39lhij,mrsspanko2,8,Sat Jun 13 01:25:30 2015 UTC,"1) ""It's hard to ignore the sub"" - from a spammer's POV because there are so many people who can see the spam? Look, people don't care about spammers and why they're spamming. People care about freebies of value.  2) An easy solution is to use AutoModerator to automatically remove eBook links from new/low karma accounts as /u/yukisho and /u/silentmarine suggested. Just because there's a lot of spam doesn't mean nothing should be done about it.  3) It won't cut off the flow of content. Spam has always been disallowed on reddit.com. If app developers start spamming, then I believe the community would respond appropriately too. Besides, none of this has happened.  This thread is now among the top posts on /r/eFreebies, so it suggests a lot of people are tired of the constant stream of useless eBooks being spammed. Of course the authors/spammers are upset - but this sub was never about helping the authors, it's to provide freebies of value to the community."
eFreebies,39lhij,TotesMessenger,2,Fri Jun 12 22:53:37 2015 UTC,"That's why reports are so important. If you see spam, please report it! Automod does that already, for those who didn't read our comment thread above :) The ebooks that you see on our pages right now are all actual content. I get that people want some sort of quality control, so that's something we'll work towards."
eFreebies,39lhij,Rajhin,7,Fri Jun 12 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"Restriction kills subs.   So does liberalism. Of the 25 posts on the front page of this sub, 11 are eBooks. Half of those eBook posts have ZERO FUCKING POINTS. That means less than half the people looking at the post are upvoting it. In a subreddit where literally every post can make it to the front page regardless of community action, some form of restriction has to take place to insure quality."
eFreebies,39lhij,banned_accounts,0,Sat Jun 13 05:18:58 2015 UTC,That is a very valid point. I agree with you %100 because that demonstrates the structure of reddit itself isn't working.
eFreebies,39lhij,coerciblegerm,8,Fri Jun 12 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"It's not that the structure doesn't work. The issue is the amount of content being posted. When your front page is more or less a reorganized version of your new page, there simply is no getting around subpar content making it to the front page without removing it manually. Taking that into consideration, I can't say I'm 100% in favor of removing eBooks, since they do actually represent half the content being submitted to this sub. But on the other hand, when half the content is mostly shitty content, sometimes less is more."
eFreebies,39lhij,Gryphticon,-1,Fri Jun 12 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"If that's the case then the karma threshold by an auto moderator would be the first approach to try.  I also wanted to add that a lot of this was caused by Amazon making it difficult for free books to get any attention on their own site. Reddit became the surrogate support. Add to that tons of entrepreneur posts about how they made it to the top of reddit by submitting here, and you get the current problem."
eFreebies,39lhij,coerciblegerm,6,Fri Jun 12 23:59:36 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what makes it hard to get attention for free books on Amazon? I'm constantly browsing through the free books on the Kindle app, and have found some real gems. Unfortunately I have to sift through 50-60 shitty romance-fanfiction-disguised-as-fantasy/sci-fi to find one book that actually looks like it's worth downloading."

eFreebies,39chkh,JackWilfred,2,Thu Jun 11 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"Then you were misinformed. Roblox seems to be better than ever, it can be considered a game engine now that they have their own custom made engine (Roblox ran on the Ogre Engine before).  Of course, most of the players are kids but there are also plenty of teenagers and adults that enjoy Roblox for creative purposes.  The main difference is that you can re-create Minecraft on Roblox but on the other hand, you can't re-create Roblox in Minecraft.  Anyways, there seems to be general misinformation about both games and alot of people thinking both are the same."

eFreebies,3972ah,just-plop,14,Tue Jun 9 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"I was homeless, depressed and unable to find a job at the time I first published. I'd written this book before everything went to crap, but couldn't find an agent/publisher to save my life. I sent out dozens of query letters over the years and hadn't received any response. Because I take things so personally, I thought that meant the book sucked and no one would ever want to read it, instead of realizing the publishing industry was going through its own transition and weren't really taking on too many new unknowns.   I'd read about sucessful self-publishers like Michael Sullivan and EL James and Hugh Howey and figured if they could do it, so could I. And, the fact I was desperately broke didn't help things. So, I decided to throw the book up on Amazon with their KDP Select program. I figured even if I only sold a few copies to friends and family, at least that $15 would be a week's worth of food.   Instead, it turns out people actually seem to like the book and the series. So, with the positive reinforcement I got from making sales and encouragement from some very kind readers (some of whom discovered my stuff on Reddit), along with some really hard work, I managed to feed myself using just this book for a few months until I found a new gig. Then I wrote another, and another, and another, until I realized I had found my purpose without even meaning to.  Ever since I put the book up for people to buy, my life has gotten better every single day. Funny how life works I guess."

eFreebies,387ad8,saric92,3,Tue Jun 2 20:09:57 2015 UTC,"Miles. In the antivirus test AV-TEST, MSE is the baseline for antiviruses. It has good Performance and Usability, but literally the lowest Protection score out of all antiviruses tested.  Here's the latest test done in April 2015 testing on a Windows 7 computer. Bitdefender Internet Security 2015 scored 5/5 for every section. The only other AV which got the same perfect score is Kaspersky Internet Security 2015.  Diverging from the question… I think you can use any antivirus from that list with a Protection score of over 4 if you know what you're doing on a computer. Not clicking on obvious viruses, running an ad blocker, knowing what is suspicious when you see it. It'd be even better if you know what to do in the case you are infected: MBAM, recovery discs, system restores, etc."

eFreebies,36cpy8,curiousdan,3,Mon May 18 09:48:24 2015 UTC,"Please, before converting a video to GIF, consider if it really necessary.  GIFs were not designed for videos. The format was defined in 1987 and it is restricted to a 256-color palette. The compression algorithm is extremely simple (the file size gets very large unless you have a large sequence of the exact same color).  Because of the shorcomings of the GIF format, several image-hosting services are using web video instead. Read more:   https://gfycat.com/about https://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF"
eFreebies,36cpy8,denilsonsa,2,Mon May 18 13:47:55 2015 UTC,"GIF:       The Graphics Interchange Format (better known by its acronym GIF /ˈdʒɪf/ or /ˈɡɪf/) is a bitmap image format that was introduced by CompuServe in 1987  and has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability.  The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make the GIF format less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with continuous color, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.  GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between the software patent holder, Unisys, and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) standard. By 2004 all the relevant patents had expired.    Image i     Interesting: Bollnäs GIF | Sollefteå GIF | GIF Nike | FC Höllviken   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Binaural recording is intended for replay using headphones and will not translate properly over stereo speakers.

eFreebies,3410gw,multiple_coke_easley,5,Mon Apr 27 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that newer Verizon devices are already unlocked.   One thing to note here in terms of software phone locks is that all Verizon 4G LTE smartphones come unlocked out of the box. The reason why is that the spectrum Verizon is using to build its 4G LTE network had restrictions put on it by the Federal Communications Commission, which required the company to allow ""open access"" to the network. So as part of this provision, Verizon has decided not to lock those devices. That said, its 3G devices are locked.

(3 are the Bat out of Hell trilogy)   Oh God! There's a third Bat out of Hell? The guy is really coasting on the nostalgia for that first album, isn't he?  STORY TIME:  I used to work as an usher at a concert venue when I was in High School. Meatloaf did a show there sometime after Bat Out Of Hell II came out. His daughter was in the band with him and he'd take time out between every song to remark on how beautiful she was and how he knew all the guys out in the audience wanted to fuck her. Which, yeah, okay she was pretty do-able from what I remember, but his constant talking about it gave everyone the creeps.   And the worst part of the show.....I mean the absolute WORST part....worse than any of the shitty songs he played between the good ones....worse than any of the crazy little tirades he went on....was the fact that he WOULD NOT GET OFF THE FUCKING STAGE! Three encores later and I'm begging to the Music Gods to kill this man so I could finally clock out and go home.    In retrospect, I would assume that, if you're a fan of someone's music and are at their concert, having them play 4 encores would be a pretty epic thing to witness. Certainly, about a dozen people were thrilled with the guy that night. Good for them. For me, after the concert, I fought through the traffic of tens of Meatloaf fans exiting the concert so I could go home and jerk off to the thought of defiling his daughter in the most sick, depraved ways possible."

Here's BERNIE the sentient software at his most ridiculous, Frisky the killer gerbil at her most terrifying, and the never failing Depth Charges.  But there's more! Here is Tucker writing as a doting if sometimes infuriated father, with his son in the title piece as a strikingly talented child actor. And, here too, we have heart-felt little portraits of home life, the lives and deaths of beloved pets, and movements of tenderness with family and friends…  Plus, we have something terrifying. Here Tucker gives an account of a fire that nearly claimed the lives of a family of close friends...  AND, we have Tucker as a intellectual. Here, for instance, we have his thoughts about the great comic Fred Allen, plus his impassioned defense of Nancy Drew and children's literature in general.  So, give this selection of Cargos a try.

eFreebies,32za4o,_no_fap,4,Tue Apr 21 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"This looks like a new VPN From Steganos after examining the download.  ""file1.steganos.com""  Here is the TorrentFreak Article of their other/old service, or is it the same service? Who knows.  http://torrentfreak.com/anonymous-vpn-service-provider-review-2015-150228/2/  1. Do you keep ANY logs which would allow you to match an IP-address and a time stamp to a user of your service? If so, exactly what information do you hold and for how long?  We do not store any user data, neither regarding IP-addresses nor time stamps.  2. Under what jurisdiction(s) does your company operate?  We operate under German jurisdiction, where no data retention law is in force. Therefore, currently there is no legal basis in Germany that forces Steganos to store user data. This means that we do not have any information to share with third parties or court.  3. What tools are used to monitor and mitigate abuse of your service?   In order to protect our users from abuse we keep our servers safeguarded against malware and abuse-software, for example by constantly providing security updates and blocking unnecessary ports. We do not monitor any activities of our users, but retain the possibility to block ports which are reported to be used exceptionally often for abuse (e.g. spamming).*   4. Do you use any external email providers (e.g. Google Apps) or support tools ( e.g Live support, Zendesk) that hold information provided by users?  4. We use Google Apps within our company. Our support service additionally uses Zendesk, which logs some user information. As these are stored on different servers, they cannot be used for user identification though.  5. In the event you receive a DMCA takedown notice or European equivalent, how are these handled?  After receiving such a notification, Steganos takes seizure according to its own measures that we consider appropriate. In general, this would be the restriction of access to the copyright protected work, but not the blocking of a user.  6. What steps are taken when a valid court order requires your company to identify an active user of your service? Has this ever happened?  Steganos has taken a strong stance for data security and protection for years and defended customer information against any disclosure. This means that we try to prevent the identification of our users and even go to court, if necessary, like in 2009. Back then the data retention law imposed by EU was in force in Germany. Nevertheless, Steganos refused to release the IP-address of a user to the lower regional court of Bamberg and successfully proceeded against this court order.  7. Does your company have a warrant canary or a similar solution to alert customers to gag orders?  As our company is not based in the US, we do not need any warrant canary.  8. Is BitTorrent and other file-sharing traffic allowed on all servers? If not, why?  BitTorrent is not actively blocked as of now.  9. Which payment systems do you use and how are these linked to individual user accounts?  Our customers can pay easily and securely via Paypal, Credit Card (Mastercard, Visa), bank transfer, check or Giropay. All billing information is stored on different servers and cannot be linked to users by any means.  10. What is the most secure VPN connection and encryption algorithm you would recommend to your users? Do you provide tools such as “kill switches” if a connection drops and DNS leak protection?  We recommend OpenVPN with 256-bit AES encryption and therefore work with it in our product “Steganos Online Shield VPN“. As we believe it to be the most secure option, we are also currently planning on implementing it in our VPN tool “OkayFreedom” (which uses 128-bit blowfish as encryption algorithm so far). We neither offer tools regarding kill switches nor DNS leak protection as of now.  11. Do you use your own DNS servers? (if not, which servers do you use?)  We use Google Public DNS server, which we consider unproblematic. It is not only the biggest public server with over 130 billion requests per day and works fast, but also does not store personally identifiable information nor IP-addresses permanently and all temporary logs are deleted after 48   12. Do you have physical control over your VPN servers and network or are they outsourced and hosted by a third party (if so, which ones)? Where are your servers located?  We offer servers located in 12 different countries, which are: Egypt, France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the USA.  Therefore we collaborate with several third party providers that reside in these countries, for example 1&1 Internet AG in Germany, hosttech GmbH in Switzerland and SAKURA Internet Inc. in Japan. Despite we do not have physical control over the VPN servers there, we always take security measures like installing our operating system directly on these servers. It is to mention, that all login servers are placed in Germany where we have full control over them."

In those types of classes, it's not what the answer is but how you get the answer that's important.  You also retain the information better and actually learn from it rather than reading from some Yahoo Answers post 3 years ago about a problem similar but not quite the same as your's. The answers to technical questions you could find range from finding the molar mass of methyl 3-nitrobenzoate, to integrating extremely difficult functions and would require the use of partial derivatives or integration by parts. It isn't limited to just math and chem either, but those are just examples.  It's soooo much better than Google and once you use it, you will completely understand why."

eFreebies,327lls,TheTechSingularity,2,Sat Apr 11 12:37:17 2015 UTC,Is it similar to final fantasy or any RPG games?
eFreebies,327lls,Chinny4daWinny,3,Sat Apr 11 14:58:20 2015 UTC,"It's more rogue like-ish. It's pretty difficult and once you die you have to start from the beginning, but you collect gold to buy upgrades with. Kind of like Rogue Legacy but with different dungeon floors instead of parts of the castle/woods/etc.   Each character also has their own story that you learn about as you progress through the dungeons."
eFreebies,327lls,Tomato_Farmer73,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:27:12 2015 UTC,From the beginning of the level or beginning of the game?  Have you played dungeon hunter? Is it like that?
eFreebies,327lls,Chinny4daWinny,2,Sat Apr 11 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"It's not really like dungeon hunter, no. You start from the bottom floor and work your way up, I haven't beaten the first boss but I'd imagine there are check points in there."
eFreebies,327lls,Tomato_Farmer73,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:34:50 2015 UTC,Oh okay and do you level your characters or something or get new weapons or its like you're given x to finish the game with?  I'm downloading the game right now
eFreebies,327lls,Chinny4daWinny,2,Sat Apr 11 19:36:38 2015 UTC,"It's kind of complicated in a way. You earn gold to upgrade certain stats and gain some abilities, but your main means of improvement seems to be areas that you find that look like forges which will let you take one of  two certain upgrades. So if it says you can upgrade your weapon, you can go for a slower or faster weapon, each of a higher level than your starting, for example.   Again I haven't really played much, but from what I understand this is how it works (I've also only played the warrior, but I doubt it's too different for the others)."

eFreebies,327pqb,sciguymjm,3,Sat Apr 11 08:33:29 2015 UTC,"Fun game. It's a dungeon crawler (more or less) and you pick one of three starting characters with their own unique back story, which is explained in more detail the farther you progress. Every several floors has a boss to fight, and once you die you have to start from the first floor (kind of like pixel dungeon but you earn gold for upgrades).  It's pretty challenging, but the controls are pretty good. And my favorite thing is, from my experience, you can exit the game at any time, come back to it any time, and resume from the exact same spot you left off. One day I closed the game, opened it back up over a month later and was in the middle of a dungeon. It's also pretty expensive so Free is too good to pass up."

eFreebies,31xiu3,smakai,6,Thu Apr 9 03:46:40 2015 UTC,"From my comment earlier today when this was posted and this question asked:  Vessel is a pay-per-YouTube. It costs, I believe, $3/month and people will release videos on it, the same as they would do YouTube.  I am subbed to three channels on YT that are using Vessel (Veritasium, Minute Physics and Minute Earth), and they basically said that they will release the save videos on both platforms but with YT being delayed. In these cases, you can think of it as similar to Patreon; you support your favorite channel hosts and they give you early access to contact."

You are confusing two unrelated things. Both WGL and Pro obviously use Unicode here. Also being able to have a lot of different alphabets in one file has nothing to do with either of these two, it's a feature of the OpenType font format (up to 65,536 glyph per font)."

eFreebies,31ndb7,BelfortAndBastion,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:30:57 2015 UTC,"An important new book from an important new writer…  In 2008, Tristan Gans and his fiancé Sarah went to Italy on what was supposed to be an idyllic season in the sun. What they got was months in a grimy little industrial city where the locals were hostile and the only real connections they could make were with other foreigners, other Stranieri, living and working in Italy in spite of the objections of the ""real"" Italians.  But, as Gans soon realizes, it is the Strangers who hold the whip hand. It is they who provide the services, labor, and energy that the Italians cannot seem to produce for themselves. In this thought-provoking book, he asks what will Italy be, and how will ""native"" Italians react, when Italy is as much African, Pakistani, and Slav as it is Latin.  But Gans doesn't stop there. In this multifaceted, multilayered work, Gans uses Italy as a metaphor for the West as a whole—a West that may be, he suggests, sliding into postindustrial irrelevance.  And for Gans that possibility has a unique piquancy. He is, he explains, a Millennial, and like most upper-middle class members of his generation he has from his earliest youth been taught to seek success, even greatness at all costs. But ""greatness,"" as Baby Boomer parents defined it, may not be possible in an age of decline.  And thus, he concludes, he and his sort are the ultimate Stranieri, alienated not only from their world but even from their own conceptions of themselves."

eFreebies,311xsn,dead_in_the_boot,7,Wed Apr 1 13:24:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! I'll finally get to check out Killzone Mercenary and Dishonored.
eFreebies,311xsn,FrusenGladje,16,Wed Apr 1 13:37:17 2015 UTC,If this is considered an eFreebie can we just post Netflix titles too?  None of these are free. This is a subscription based service.
eFreebies,311xsn,erich00041,6,Wed Apr 1 20:31:12 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if these titles are always free under PS Plus or are they temporarily free?
eFreebies,311xsn,erich00041,10,Thu Apr 2 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"As long as you add them to your library this month you can re-download and play them for as long as you have PS Plus.   If your subscription expires then all of these ""free"" games are unusable until you resubscribe (even with the quotes it hurts to use the word ""free"" there)."
eFreebies,311xsn,erich00041,4,Thu Apr 2 00:29:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info :)  On /r/freebies, we allow certain membership freebies (Sam's Club, AAA, and the like) since they don't come up too often and don't really have a home anywhere else. The same works here, even if their ""DRM"" (aka, only playable if you have the membership) is annoying.  Since this offer is only temporary, it's okay here. If they become an issue, then we'll consider moving them to another sub though."
eFreebies,311xsn,erich00041,3,Thu Apr 2 00:37:18 2015 UTC,This is hardly temporary. There is a new set of games every single month. Always consisting of two games for each system.   This is the same as every month has been for the past year. It's essentially the only reason Sony got users to start paying for online service.  It's a core component of PS Plus.
eFreebies,311xsn,erich00041,3,Thu Apr 2 00:41:20 2015 UTC,"The games are temporary though, if I'm understanding correctly.  I, personally, don't like how they only let you play the games while you have membership, but people who have the membership seem appreciative to know that they're available to dl only during April."
eFreebies,311xsn,demonsoliloquy,2,Thu Apr 2 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"Only in the same way Netflix titles are temporary. Different shows or games come and go throughout the year. The cost is included in your subscription and the content is only available for as long as you have the subscription.   You aren't even buying the games. You're only renting them long-term.  That's like saying being able to browse Sam's Club is a freebie that comes with the subscription. No, that's literally the service that you're paying for."
eFreebies,311xsn,NoFaithInPeopleAnyMo,2,Thu Apr 2 01:05:22 2015 UTC,"Only in the same way Netflix titles are temporary.   Ah, but you don't have access to the titles once they've taken them down.  It sounds like that once you take up this offer, the game's available to play whenever you have the membership, but if you try to download these games (for the first time) on May 1st, it won't let you. If I'm misunderstanding that, let me know, since I don't have a PS."
eFreebies,311xsn,zamwut,3,Thu Apr 2 01:32:46 2015 UTC,"That's all correct. And I think I understand that you believe the post should stay up due to the 1 month exclusivity of these specific titles. I would agree if this was posted on /r/Playstation , /r/PS4 , etc. It's good info for the extreme minority of subscribers that don't know.   But this is a paid service where vast majority people who purchase it do so because this monthly bundle is the primary incentive. PS Plus is sold as more of a Monthly Mystery Box than anything else.   It's just that no part of this is free and it seems completely inappropriate in any sort of Freebies section."
eFreebies,311xsn,xXSmuggla,2,Thu Apr 2 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"extreme minority of subscribers   I'm not sure how you determined that. Upvotes are generally a good indicator, and if you were to compare this post to many of the apps, eBooks, or many other posts, then it'd seem that they are the ones that don't fit in here.   where vast majority people who purchase it do so because [of] this monthly bundle   This would surprise me. It might be what some people do, but I'd imagine most people already have the membership. If people sign up just to get this, more power to them, but it's more for people who already have a membership.  That being said, this sub is still primarily for non-membership freebies, so if these start to become too numerous, then they'll be better suited to another sub."
eFreebies,311xsn,GMFK,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:13:15 2015 UTC,"You're wrong.  You get to keep the games so they are not temporary, and there are already a few subs for this, namely /r/PSPLUS, /r/PS4, /PSVITA.....really any playstation sub."
eFreebies,311xsn,RemindMeBot,3,Thu Apr 2 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"I misspoke; the offer to download the games is what's temporary, AFAIK, not the games themselves."
eFreebies,311xsn,Abel_Graham,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:58:57 2015 UTC,There is nothing free about this.
eFreebies,311xsn,demonsoliloquy,2,Wed Apr 1 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"My biggest complaint about this submission, is the excessive proclamation of what the prices are normally for each title."

eFreebies,310zbe,8-3P,2,Wed Apr 1 06:32:05 2015 UTC,"I picked up ""Quell: Memento"" when it was listed as a free app a short time ago, and I can say that that game is actually one of my favourites on my tablet.   With gameplay reminiscent of Sokoban, with no timers to beat, and an unlimited number of retries - your only goals are to complete the level, complete it in the least number of moves, and to uncover hidden items along the way.  It's a very relaxing game, that's more of a logic puzzle than an arcade game. With beautiful music and artwork, and almost etheric vocal recordings that remind me of so many nights spent playing Myst. Simple, but engaging, and a great way to pass some time.  If Quell: Reflect is anything like Quell: Memento... it's completely worth picking up for free.  Spoilers... but here's some video of the game's first few training levels."

eFreebies,30ypw0,markoid,7,Tue Mar 31 19:57:48 2015 UTC,Is it permanent?
eFreebies,30ypw0,themoo96,4,Tue Mar 31 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"Ditto. I would assume so? I'm guessing this is marketing tactic to increase their user-base, who of course will continue to talk them up after the promotion if they are a worthwhile company."

eFreebies,30s93m,Gonzored,0,Tue Mar 31 03:43:14 2015 UTC,Isnt that game just riddled with in app purchases.... should be free to begin with if theyre gonna try to charge you for half the new levels anyways....
eFreebies,30paa7,EpicLegendX,3,Sun Mar 29 14:39:49 2015 UTC,...seems somewhat similar in playstyle to Super Meat Boy.    Anyone find this game any fun to play?

eFreebies,30k8q3,dead_in_the_boot,22,Sat Mar 28 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"It's free for anyone with a gold membership, you don't have to own Forza Horizon 2...it's a standalone expansion."

eFreebies,30k8q3,Exterminate_doc,3,Sat Mar 28 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure but I will say its very easy and short.  Also the cars do not transfer into your horizon game.  So in short, while horizon is amazing, don't buy it just for this."
eFreebies,30k8q3,sc0lm00,10,Sat Mar 28 04:12:51 2015 UTC,"It is free for anyone until April 10. Also, a very quick way to get 2000 Gamer Score (for those Achievement Hunters out there), and if you plan on getting a Xbox 1, add it to your collection so that you can start building it up (if you haven't been getting the Games with Gold offerings for Xbox 1)."
eFreebies,30k8q3,Edallag,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:37:29 2015 UTC,It's free forever as long as you download it before April 10 so if you don't have an Xbox one but you want it on there you're gonna have to have a friend download it for you.
eFreebies,30k8q3,KalElKent821,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"Nope. As long as you have it 'bought', it is yours to keep. No need to have a friend download it for you or anything like that."

eFreebies,30k8q3,fivmincal,15,Sat Mar 28 05:27:54 2015 UTC,"Not really. It does a great job as an impressive demo for Forza Horizon 2 BETTER than the actual Horizon 2 demon, can be used to boost sales for Horizon and Horizon 2 (if you like something that is free, eventually it'll lead you to buy into a franchise), and it serves as a way to get hype brought to Fast 7.  Everyone wins, honestly."
eFreebies,30k8q3,Edallag,3,Sat Mar 28 05:40:43 2015 UTC,This is dead on. I normally don't like forza games and have been on the fence about getting horizon 2 for a while cause its not like a normal forza game. After playing this I will definitely buy forza horizon 2.
