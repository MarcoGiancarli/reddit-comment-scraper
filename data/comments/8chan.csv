8chan,3d2xnf,keldoftheisles,-2,Mon Jul 13 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"On PC yes, the game is at fault. The thing is, you have unlimited hardware, and you can put the specs at what you want. If the game doesn't run on the recomended specs, it isn't the PC's fault, it's the devs fault 100% of the time."

8chan,3d2xnf,K10S,2,Tue Jul 14 07:32:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely helpful.  Still, the issue of I bought a PC so I could play game X but now I've bought game X and even though my PC has all the reqs, it just doesn't run well on this graphics card or is just not working, so even though I can get my money back, I still can't play the game I wanted to."

8chan,3d2xnf,SoulStar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:16:08 2015 UTC,Just making a point that a downside to PC is a lack of certainty when buying games that they'll work properly.

8chan,3d2xnf,stormclaw11,3,Tue Jul 14 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"I am a PC gamer. I have given more money to steam and gog than any console ever. But I also like consoles. And it bothers me that many PC gamers see the PC as the ultimate machine of past, present and future. Because muh graphics right? However thats hardly the most important thing in a game, wouldn't you agree?  With consoles came the invention of dedicated input devices. PC developers only really focused on what could be done with a keyboard and a mouse, because who was going to ship a controller with their game. (And I'm not talking about input devices that are specific to one game or genre, like Guitar Hero guitars or Flight simulator joysticks)  You could never have had an experience like Mario without the NES and the gamepad. Or Ocarina of Time without the N64 and the invention of the thumbstick. Just like you still cannot have an experience like Skyward Sword on PC now. And that includes the countless games and genres that were born with that and the many others that evolved from there.  Today you can obviously buy a controller for PC and many games are developed with that in mind. But it wouldn't have gotten to this point without consoles.  And maybe you don't really care about any of those games. And maybe you think that console controllers have evolved a little too far into gimmicky territory. But it moved the industry forward in ways much more important than just graphics and most importantly in my opinion it still is.   And that's only talking about controllers, not to get into things like the simplicity of buying a game for that system and it works, or being able to play local multiplayer easily, the much lower cost, and all the other things listed in this thread."
8chan,3d2xnf,oscarandjo,0,Tue Jul 14 00:26:39 2015 UTC,"PC is definitely the ultimate machine of today and probably the ultimate machine of the future. Not because of graphics, but because of versatility.  Yes, consoles brought about the innovation of the past, and are still affecting the innovations of today. They have just stopped affecting the major hardware of today. PC has blown away console's performance and even at cost for performance if you plan to game.1 2  Graphics comparisons are often done because that's one of the easiest ways to show the difference between PC and console.  Not only does PC look better, but it has a higher and often more stable FPS.1 PC also has the largest game library to date1 and the best backwards compatibility.[see GoG.com]  Dedicated input devices have been a give and take. Consoles made controllers, PC adapted them for it's own use. PC made webcams, PS2 made that EyeToy and Xbox made Kinect. PC then took Kinect and used it for lots of hobbyist things like 3d imaging.  This was mainly the progression of technology. Most if not all of the games you mentioned can be played on PC today including Skyward Sword.1 Even 3DS, PS3 and Xbox360 are starting to be emulated with varying degrees of success.1 2 3  I do really care about those games. In fact, I've played through a large portion of my old console library with new and improved graphics due to emulation. [1 vs emulated upscaled] 2 3 4  Games are easy to buy on PC and if they don't work, it's the fault of the developer or your system just can't handle it. If it's the former problem, patches are easy to roll out and are sometimes created by the community. Many PC games support local multiplayer easily. I recently had 4 people around my PC playing the awesome indie game Screencheat.  As for gimmicky controllers, most of them have been awesome and picked up by PC for awesome things. I've seen people take Wiimotes and create a virtual whiteboard with them, and I'm looking forward to the cool stuff people will do with the WiiU gamescreen.  Really, PC's main advantage is how open it is. It has a near constant update cycle with large amounts of backwards compatibility. Consoles are often left behind towards the last half of their generation just because their generations last for 6-10 years. Nintendo is better at this as they usually create a console and produce lots of first party games for it that perform quite well. Microsoft and Sony haven't been so great since their recent installments have been comparatively underpowered PCs with their outdated hardware and general focus of becoming a media machine instead of a dedicated gaming machine."
8chan,3d2xnf,iamoforange,2,Tue Jul 14 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with most of that. But I think you missed my point a little. At some point you will obviously be able to emulate every console ever made for the PC (And Skyward Sword you can only really emulate if you have an real wii remote plus, cause dolphin cannot emulate wii motion plus).   My point is that those kind of games, experiences and wii remotes would not exist without consoles in the first place. So PC needs consoles to continue to innovate and consoles need PCs for the technology.   And you are right, its awesome that you can do whatever you want on a PC, thanks to its open nature. But that open nature also comes with the downside of not being able to control how a player plays your game. Which can be a very good thing in my opinion. Its a little like Hitchcock giving specific instructions to cinemas on how to show his movies and telling audiences that they're not allowed to come late into the film. I think that's what I like most about consoles. You're playing the game exactly as the creators intended. At the same time I think its amazing to be able to play other games however the hell you like. Thats what I love PC for.  But I guess Im mostly talking about Nintendo and not consoles in general. They are cheaper than PCs though and much easier to understand than PC gaming for the average person. Many people (including 90% of my friends) that own a Playstation or Xbox dont even know what Steam is, let alone how to build a PC. Simplicity and convenience goes a long way for consumers. I guess that's another plus for consoles, they have made gaming a lot more popular that it would be if we only had PCs. There probably wouldn't even be an e3 for gods sake.  So my point stands, I really think if we didnt have consoles or if we didnt have PC gaming a huge part of what I love about gaming would disappear. At least the way things are right now."

8chan,3cnyvi,stridernfs,2,Fri Jul 10 11:36:33 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: PR wizard and master of mass psychology Edward Bernays convinced the American people to fluoridate their water after the aluminum industry (Alcoa) approached him. Alcoa needed a means to rid itself of its environmentally hazardous and potentially health hazardous manufacturing waste (fluorosilicic acid) at a profit.  Bernays utilized the endorsement of the American Dental Association and it was smooth sailing from there to convince the American public. No conspiracy, no new world order, no true dental benefits either, just clever business tactics. Today, the manufacturing companies ship their fluoride to water supplies around the world.  Among the other more well-known things Bernays has successfully campaigned for:   cigarette smoking for women (then turned around and helped an anti-smoking campaign) the admittedly delicious bacon and eggs as an American breakfast staple, using the endorsements of medical doctors that a heavier breakfast was best, and the old meme ""breakfast is the most important meal of the day"" propaganda that aided in the overthrowing of the Guatemalan government for Chiquita, then known as the United Fruit Company."

They'll ban you eventually, but just use a different IP and do it again as many times as you'd like  This is exactly what that virgin biologist guy did, only since he's never had sex, he was too beta to figure out how to dodge ""le ban"".

Already I finger my ringer while jerking off and gazing deeply into my own eyes in the mirror, but it's still not quite enough to satisfy my ego. I am in the process of putting together a Kickstarter (complete with a video featuring my sultry voice) to raise funds for cloning research. Already great advances have been made with cloning animals like dogs and sheep, but I don't want to fuck those. I want to fuck myself. So please, donate your hard earned money today so I can fulfill my wildest dream of fucking myself in the ass. If I raise enough money for stretch goals I can make a second clone who will fuck me in the ass while I'm fucking myself in the ass. If I raise enough money for clones the only limit is literally how many holes my body has. Thank you for your time.      ♥Voice"

8chan,3ag9cp,screwthepresent,12,Mon Jun 22 17:23:13 2015 UTC,"Incase anyone doesn't have adblock, we don't want to give them views. ===article===  The Fappening is now happening to regular citizens. Hackers have aggregated 400-500 personal erotic photographs made by Australian women and posted the results on 8chan. Whoever was responsible for the hack posted images of file directories on their computer, publishing the names of the women depicted. Obviously, none of these women wanted their nude selfies to be posted on 8chan. Legally, the nude selfies are copyright of the women who took them. Theoretically, the women should be able to get them taken down. But for the maladapted shits who collect and distribute these leaked selfies, violation of privacy is part of the thrill. Calling this photo hack ""revenge porn"" is not exactly accurate. Unless the hacker who posted these is the biggest player in Adelaide, they can't possibly be the ex of each of these individual women. Nor did every wronged ex-boyfriend in Australia happen to descend upon 8chan this week & post their ex-girlfriend's erotic selfies. It is likelier that these photos were illegally acquired and aggregated by complete strangers - just as the celebrity nude photo leaks of last year's ""The Fappening"" were. Noted child porn distributor and 8ch.net admin Fredrick Brennan has refused to comply with requests to take the leaked photos down. He ignored multiple complaints that some of the photos depicted underage girls. Instead, Brennan publicly mocked anyone who contacted him about it, participated in discussion threads containing the leaked photographs, and claims he hasn't received any ""properly executed DMCAs."" Brennan also archived the threads in which the photographs appeared, making the efforts of lower-level admins and volunteers to delete or remove content related to the Adelaide leak obsolete. Apparently, in Brennan's twisted little world, the proper response to hearing someone hosted hundreds of stolen nudes on your site is to enshrine that post on the top of every web page and hope it boosts your notoriety. Let's hope that world crumbles pretty soon."

8chan,39mkec,ginx2666,8,Sat Jun 13 04:15:51 2015 UTC,Warrant Canary?
8chan,39mkec,Th1Alchemyst,4,Sat Jun 13 04:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yes! That's it, thank you!"
8chan,39mkec,ginx2666,6,Sat Jun 13 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"The only real answer for this is ""Maybe.""  Warrant canaries themselves have not yet been tested in open court.  However, there is a similar concept that we can look to:  When automobiles were new and mostly owned by rich people, several towns across the UK (common law system, similar to the US) started instituting very low speed limits as a way to extract revenue from the rich car owners.  Really ridiculously low speed limits.  The rich car owners were upset by this, so they formed The AA.  Today that is basically the british equivalent of the American AAA, the guys that help you out with dead batteries and whatnot.  But at the time they had a different job: The AA employed young men on bicycles to bike around the countryside, looking for speed traps.  When they found a speed trap, they would park their bike a mile or so on either side from it, and flag down every passing driver to warn them about the speed trap.  Police were furious about this, because the AA was denying them speeding ticket revenue.  They took the AA to court, arguing that the AA was interfering in police business.  Unfortunately, the courts sided with the police, against the AA.  The AA was not deterred though, they adopted a new strategy.  They would send out their bike boys, same as usual, except they had different instructions.  They were to salute every single passing car, at all times.  They were to do this unless there was something wrong.  They would never salute if there was a speed trap, so if you were driving along and saw an AA bike boy who wasn't saluting, you knew there was a speed trap.  The legal theory here was that the government could not legally demand that a civilian salute a car driver.  Very similar to the warrant canary.  The warrant canary depends on the states legal inability to compel speech (rather than silence), much like the AA bike guys depended on the state being legally unable to compel them to salute.  It's not quite the same, but it is pretty close. This worked for the AA for several decades, before they decided to discontinue the practice.  They weren't shut down in court again."
8chan,39mkec,LeopardStrainer,2,Sun Jun 14 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"Well what do you know, today I learned a new, interesting thing. Thank you!"
8chan,39mkec,ginx2666,4,Sun Jun 14 14:54:39 2015 UTC,That means that they have been issued those court orders. Gag orders have a clause to not reveal that they are being served which leads websites to say they haven't been served as a signal to say that they have. It's a Warrant Canary. If they truly haven't been served then they wouldn't say anything.
8chan,39mkec,LiterallyKesha,3,Sat Jun 13 15:57:19 2015 UTC,So 8chan has secret orders?

Not saying that whenever there's a RIP moot thread, there isn't anyone calling him a fucking cuck, you'll still get a few people calling him out, but the majority of people truly do miss him. But on Reddit, by far everyone fucking hates him and calling him a cuck is easy karma.   There is a very large dissonance of perspectives from people who talk about 4chan on reddit and actual 4chan users, but if you compare the views of redditors and 8chan? One and the damn same."

I myself became a meme because many young people are frustrated by the hopelessness and bitterness at the unjust world around them. I’m the bearer of bad news and I want to help them.

""The poor do not overthrow the rich in order to benefit the poor, they overthrow the rich in order to become the rich""  Very few are truly out to divide the wealth, raise the general standard of living, and level the playing field. What most of the people who say they're after that want is just to get themselves higher up the ladder. Destroy the rich, and put themselves in charge of redistributing, so that they get to say who has what. And it's the same in everything, which is why stuff like 'diversity quotas' and 'women's scholarships' are never going away."

8chan,3603y9,Reason-and-rhyme,7,Fri May 15 03:48:29 2015 UTC,"First off, define wealthy. Secondly, I think a lot of wealthy college kids tend to be slightly out of touch with reality in a fiscal sense. You can see examples of this with the current student loan debt crisis bubble from Hell.   I'd also say that if these kids have gotten free cars, car insurance, cellphones, computers, spending money, college tuition, etc., then they are already living a pretty privileged lifestyle."

If you don't pretend to hate yourself and your wealth, people will resent you for it. You have to distract them by blaming other people of your skin color (playing the good cop), or by blaming money for causing their ills, then atoning for your sins by pretending to reject your wealth and privilege.  No wonder rich white nations take on the most refugees and donate the most foreign aid: they're trying to show off how much more charitable they are than everyone else.

Authoritarianism helps make them feel like they have control over a world that appears chaotic and out to get them.

Same old edgy shit people have been saying for years. This is like making a greentext about how people in Egypt hate Christians, or how people in Liberia are poor as fuck. No one is on the other side of this issue, you edgelords. No one willingly moves from a first world country to America, unless they are fucking retarded."
