I'd go a generation newer for a W126 or a W123, simply because parts are more common and available in local junkyards.   Anything older like that W108 is going to be hard to source parts locally, so be prepared to wait a few days for shipping when something breaks. A W126/123 will still get you that classic Mercedes style, but it's an easier and cheaper entry point, IMO.  Full disclosure: I have a 123 and everyone should have a 123."

They should be able to double check their work and if it was done recently they i don't see why it wouldn't be free.  Also, if the technician sees that it is still dead-on, he can sometimes adjust the steering a bit to make up for the crowned roads. It all depends on works on your car."

mercedes_benz,3de7yn,IntercityLines,2,Wed Jul 15 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"I've hauled a couple of these.  Have a similar trailer to this, but work for a different company.  One was from an auction in Scottsdale (not Barrett Jackson).  I took it to Cargolux in Atlanta.  They are an all cargo airline that goes between different US airports and Europe.  The car was being shipped back to the Mercedes classic restoration center in Germany to have the engine worked on.  The car looked great but didn't run so great.  Another one I picked up at an auction in Dallas last year and took back to the company who was trying to sell it who was based in Southern California.    They are not that bad to load, even with the gullwing doors as they really aren't all that wide in comparison to modern cars.  You can actually drive it with the door open (up?) on to the trailer, which is good because the windows don't really roll down, they just kinda flip open a little bit."

mercedes_benz,3d8izl,lp608,4,Tue Jul 14 09:49:20 2015 UTC,It's a great time to buy. It's purported to be one of the best cars they've built in a long time.   The last year of any car is typically the best. All bugs have been worked out and they will likely cut you a deal to make room for the new model.
mercedes_benz,3d8izl,minibudd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. My wife has it (2014) and I think its an amazing vehicle, solid as a tank, comfortable, not made to be a sports car but still fun to drive (in sport mode). I would buy a second one to put in storage just in case something happens to this one, if we had the money haha. Tons of power (which the GLC won’t have) but we still get about 22 mpg with fairly aggressive driving, gas-wise. I definitely prefer it to the newer GLC thats coming out, at least based on the photos and the specs. Had it for about two years now - zero problems or complaints. I’m glad we went with this over the Q5."
mercedes_benz,3d8izl,this_neverhappened,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"I would wait. I just purchased the ML350's upgrade, the GLE350. The newer models that are coming out aren't a new car per say, but renamed and with more aesthetic upgrades so they won't have all the quirks of a newly designed vehicle(like the TLX for example). The internals are pretty much the same and some may be getting a new transmission but I believe that is only for the AMG lines. Mercedes seems to be upping their game with the newer models to compete with BMW and try to take the market. If you're not rushing for a new car, wait a month for the new line to come out and make a decision. If anything, the GLK350 will be cheaper."

mercedes_benz,3d8uqu,Uncle_Skeeter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:17:05 2015 UTC,I'd start with a new fuel filter and a can of seafoam.   After that it can get expensive to do diagnostic to track it down. Start there though.

mercedes_benz,3d8uqu,tiny2ner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:13:13 2015 UTC,"With respect to previous poster, I would recommend avoiding the seafoam first. That for if there is serious build up in the engine and if thats the case there is something seriously wrong with the vehicle and may make it exceedingly more difficult to figure out.   The first two things that come to mind is an update to the engine control unit. May not be programmed for adequate fuel delivery under high load conditions. In fact, I remember a recall about updating the engine control unit for fuel delivery problems. But that would only cause a check engine light, no running cgaracteristics. The other thing I think of would be a clogged egr tube due to deformation. But that applied to the 6.3s"

mercedes_benz,3d2r63,jac283,6,Mon Jul 13 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go a bit against the flow here. I agree that the transmission is probably the biggest complaint that I have with mine, it's somewhat jerky and can get confused. It's hard to find a balance between the sedate Eco mode and the overly aggressive Sport mode.  However, as a single guy in his early 20s, I am very happy with the rest of the car. It's compact and cozy, handles well (I have the 4MATIC - winter driving was amazing), and the engine is responsive, the turbo kicks in very smartly. I get a 0-60 time of about 6.3-6.5 seconds.  I have driven my fair share of C's and E's. They are not as nimble as the CLA. They may have more raw power, but they don't have the sure-footedness that the lighter CLA does. They are incredibly great vehicles, don't get me wrong.  Sure the interior is not as upscale as a C or higher, but what do you expect for $10,000 less?  It really rubs me the wrong way when people say the CLA ""isn't a true Mercedes."" It's all the little things that make a Mercedes a Mercedes. From the moonroof closing when the rain sensor senses rain, to the climate control automatically directing air out the windshield vents when it detects fogging. That's all there in the CLA. People who say the CLA isn't a real Mercedes or not a proper sports sedan have never owned one (there is a difference between just driving one and then truly owning one) and are not true auto enthusiasts, in my eyes. The MB engineering, and renowned safety, and high standards are all there.  Every naysayer I've taken for a spin in my car has come away very pleasantly surprised. I consciously chose the CLA over other MB models and am very happy with it.  All this being said, take the car for a test drive, and see how YOU feel. Don't let anyone, including myself, convince you. This is YOUR investment. Test drive multiple models from multiple brands. Don't let dedicated BMW owners – like the other poster below – or really anyone, for that matter, shove you one way or the other."
mercedes_benz,3d2r63,mrgandw,4,Mon Jul 13 06:06:49 2015 UTC,"when people say the CLA ""isn't a true Mercedes.""   People said that about the 190 series until the C class came along, then said it about the C class until the CLA came along.  It's horse shit. Complete and total non sense. Nowadays the w201 and the w202 are looked fondly upon as some of the best cars MB ever made. Ignore the elitist bull shit. History will remember the victors, not the price paid."

Other suggestion would be to never buy a Benz you haven't driven. The newer cars have some great features and some (auto shutoff, touch pad) that may well make you hate the car. Every Benz seems to be slightly different in terms of the driver interface, interior trim, seat feel,  suspension feel and the way the car drives. I swap cars 2-3 times a year and have driven most of the C's from 2012-current (between myself and my coworkers ). The ones that were best were 2013 and 2014 cars built in Germany.   Nothing wrong with a CLA, its a bit smaller, but if you put many options on it you can end up spending quite a bit on it. My coworkers that have CLA's like them."

I say this because the patent for the b7 design was filed in 2008 I believe. Your best bet for new in terms of engineering is the f30 or new c class Mercedes. However the Audi s4 20 09 came with a thundering bad ass v8 and that's just raw. It does understeer quite a bit compared to an f30 28i with stickies and wide tires.

mercedes_benz,3czhoj,shenglow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think he was asking about the one in the front, which looks to be an E-Class Coupe. How long have you had the CLS? Have you had any issues with it so far? I've been thinking of getting one, either a 350 of this generation or a first generation one with more gadgets and the airmatic suspension and I could really use some advice. I've heard people complaining about the headroom in the back and the lack of a 5th seat, but I was going to get a coupe anyway. I wouldn't cram 5 people in a sedan either and the extra doors on this one are very convenient. Not to mention they're some of the best looking cars MB has ever made in my opinion, that roofline is just perfect. It's really hard to decide which generation to get tho, initially I preferred the 2nd generation, but the more I look at the 1st generation CLS, the more I like it. And it's cheaper and I like the interior a little more."
mercedes_benz,3czhoj,tiny2ner,2,Mon Jul 13 10:48:48 2015 UTC,"Mine is just south of 40k miles and I have not had a single problem or reason to take to the dealership other than routine maintenance. Same goes for the E coupe. However, a co-worker of mine has the 1st gen CLS and has had one of his air suspension assemblies blow out. I don't know the details just that it failed. His car is around 90k miles though. Pertaining to looks I think they both look great however the LED lights do add to the attractiveness quite a bit. I've had a full car before and the passengers in the rear didn't seem to complain. Unless they're like NBA players I don't think it would be too much of an issue. Also I rarely have a full car and wouldn't recommend it especially after what happened to my friend's suspension. Other than that I don't think you can go wrong with either car they are both head turners and I also like the fact that a lot of normal people are oblivious to the CLS models. I live around the DC area and it's about a 20:1 ratio of seeing an S class to a CLS. The S and E and C are everywhere. CLS not so much. I like that."
mercedes_benz,3czhoj,IntrntKybrdWarrior,2,Mon Jul 13 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate your help. The air suspension issue doesn't sound great, but replacing one of them every 100k miles isn't that big of an issue. Also, haven't they built the same airmatic suspension into the 2nd gen CLS as a paid extra? 100k miles doesn't really sound that much for an MB here in Europe though, my father used to own multiple E-Classes(W124, 2 x w211) and a C-Class, most of them ran over 200k miles before he sold them and none of them had any major issues. Since the E-Class is allegedly what the CLS is built on, I'm confident that it's a great piece of engineering in general. The reason we don't see too many of them on the roads is probably the fact that it's such a niche vehicle. Halfway between a sportscoupe and a sedan with a luxury interior. People who want a sports car usually get a C63 or a full blow coupe, people who want a sedan get an E-Class and the people who can afford one and fall in love with the interior would probably get an S-Class. But to me, there's nothing that comes close to the mix that is the CLS, both in terms of design and performance(However your photo of that new E-Class Coupe made me double check.), and as long as I don't have to transport more than 1 additional adult regularly, I can get away with the slope of that roof."

I replaced the air filter, which may be the easiest thing I've ever done on a car, changed the oil with a new filter, and crafted a trunk mat out of a 6'x4' welcome mat I found at Home Depot, which saved me $200 under what I found an OEM one for.

mercedes_benz,3cmj1f,dave_r,-5,Sat Jul 11 22:22:48 2015 UTC,I'm still wondering why the CLA and CLS are listed as coupes. They have 4 fucking doors. So fucking stupid.
mercedes_benz,3cmj1f,Poop_is_Food,5,Thu Jul 9 06:50:10 2015 UTC,"They call them that because they don't have the standard sedan roofline, and fall more in line of the styling of a coupe with how rakish the rear roofline is, and lack of rear headroom."

mercedes_benz,3cmj1f,Mochashaft,3,Thu Jul 9 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"Coupe doesn't mean 2 doors. Often times it does, but not always.     Today coupé has become more of a marketing term for automotive manufacturers, than a fact of the vehicle's design and technical makeup. The term has been ascribed to vehicles with two, three, or four doors, for their perceived luxury or sporting appeal. This is because coupés in general are seen as more streamlined and sportier overall lines than those of comparable four-door sedans. Hence a coupé would be marketed as a sportier vehicle than a two-door sedan. While previous coupés were ""simply line-extenders two-door variants of family sedans"", some coupés have different sheet metal and styling than their four-door counterparts.   Also, while not always the case, this gives a good description:     a coupe is defined as a fixed-top car with less than 33 cubic feet of rear interior volume. Typically a car with less than 33 cubic feet of rear interior volume has only two doors, hence the common practice of associating two doors with the term “coupe.” However, there are plenty of vehicles out there which have only two doors but more than 33 cubic feet in the rear. These cars, while their manufacturers may call them coupes, are technically two-door sedans."

mercedes_benz,3cmj1f,Shengbo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:11:35 2015 UTC,"Thats a really good question. I actually had to look it up. Internally we rarely use the letter with the number, just the number. With exception to the GL and GLK class, with them being x166 and x204 respectively. So rare is it infact that I couldnt find a cut and dry answer. I am about 80% sure I have seen them listed as c219/c218, but its like a foggy memory. I know the CLA is the c117 so it wouldn't be too far of a stretch to say the CLS is a c chassis as well.

This is why a pristine 300D with working A/C, clean paint and superb mechanicals will sell for $10,000.    However, if you can do all the work yourself and you budget ahead of time for a transmission replacement at 250,000 miles, it will be an economical and efficient car that is so much more satisfying than a $3,000 Honda or Ford."

If you are still unsure you can talk to a representative via chat on their website in order to have them help you place a order that you are happy with. Also if you are worried you will not be able to install the speakers you can ask them to send you a manual for your specific car that details all installations.
mercedes_benz,3bn1r9,Rvatistanac,6,Tue Jun 30 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I have owned two W124s. These are fantastic cars. Why pre 1987? The ones after the first refresh look better IMO. Also, I believe the coupe and the sedan had the same interiors. Keep in mind, these cars came with either MB-Tex, or real leather. And the interior of each of these respective options was slightly different.   With the 300E (with the straight 6), they were known for eventually developing head gasket leaks (200,000+ miles). First sign of this is an exterior leak in the back of the engine. Second sign is oil in the coolant tank. Also, check the transmissions. These cars generally need a transmission rebuild at some point in their lives (200,000+ miles). See if there is any delay in shifting, harsh shifting, or delay getting into reverse.   Also, if you want practicality, the W124 wagon is the way to go! I personally would love to have one of those, but in the US, those are hard to find."
mercedes_benz,3bn1r9,skundu744,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:26:45 2015 UTC,"Cars (running on gasoline) built up to and including 1987 have huge tax reductions in Holland.

Most of the coupes here come with leather while most of the sedans in the same price range come with MB-tex.  I'll probably go for a 230 as these are the most common engines. I'll definitely find info on the leaks and transmission rebuilding you mentioned. The wagons are pretty common here, but I don't think I'll need the space it offers, but it's definitely an option if I can't find a solid coupe. Thanks!

mercedes_benz,3bobw4,IDownloadYourMom69,2,Fri Jul 3 12:03:56 2015 UTC,How many gallons exactly did it take to full? I ask because the fuel gauge on these cars is notoriously inaccurate. The difference can be as much as 25% between 2 identical cars. The fuel level sender wears with age and without calculatating mileage at the pump (miles traveled / gallons to full) we really don't know if your MPG is bad or normal.

mercedes_benz,3b39zg,rick_barrs,3,Fri Jun 26 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"I can help answer a few of those questions.  2)  There was a Garrett and a KKK turbo.  The Garrett seems to be far more prevalent than the KKK, and there's parts/rebuild kits available.  I know nothing about the KKK turbo.  Unsure of performance gains, but the turbo is a standard T3 flange so if you can bolt it up, it should work.  I've heard of people using VNT setups with success (A guy I know is using the VNT turbo setup from the diesel motor found in the Jeep Liberty - I want to say it's a GT28 frame but not 100% sure) but I'm not familiar with how they control the vanes.  Edit:  The KKK turbo is a ""K26"", still uses a standard T3 flange.  The Garrett is something like a 45 trim.  4)  The 300 turbo is not fast but has adequate power - that being said I couldn't imagine how scary merging into freeway traffic with a 240 or non turbo 300 would be.  5)  Yes/Yes, I would consider selling my car to the right person."

mercedes_benz,3b39zg,CineSuppa,3,Thu Jun 25 23:53:58 2015 UTC,"I can't answer these with complete confidence as I haven't rebuilt a 617 block up, but I have had 2. Both N/A, one with a 4-speed and one with an automatic transmission.  A press is required to re-sleeve the block.  There are several OM617A turbo variants, but the factory turbo is a Garrett. You can pick up remanufactured ones for $250 or so. I'm pretty sure it's an early T3. You can also upgrade. There's a handful of KKK turbos that would fit the bill, and with no electronics, there's nothing for the car to get mad at. Except for too much boost... the valves can't take the heat and that engine will likely become toast. There's no upgrade for the oil squirters. On that note, make sure whatever turbo vehicle you find was originally turbo. Slapping a turbo on the N/A 617 is bad news without the upgraded oil squirters of the 617A.  There's 2 versions of the thermostat available. The 80C and the 95C. I believe the latter is for the turbo, but don't hold me to it. Normal operating temp is 175-200F. Under load, 195F is perfectly acceptable.  Power differences: they're all slow. Just varying degrees of slow. 65 hp, 88 hp, 125 hp. Less, due to deterioration. My N/A 617 with auto trans in the W123 coupe was slow as hell. But then again, it had a thrown rod. I had another N/A 617 with a 4-speed manual in a much heavier chassis and it kept up in traffic ok. It also had Monark injectors. Highly recommend them.  The 300 Turbo's 617A is really the best way to go for power. But the N/A 617's get 1 mpg better and are slightly more reliable. But they're all slow.  I don't live near Seattle but you probably shouldn't be getting a car from up there anyway. Come down to SoCal. We have tons of old Merc diesels for sale (albeit at a premium), but the dry conditions mean many of them are survivors. Some in very, very good condition.  Best of luck."
mercedes_benz,3b39zg,BillNyesEyeGuy,3,Thu Jun 25 18:25:01 2015 UTC,"I think most of you questions have been answered, but I thought I'd share my experience as a w123 owners because I love the old girl so much. Maybe I can help convince you to get one. I've owned a lot of cars over years,  60's muscle, classic Japanese,  European. Some really unique and rare gems, but hands down my 123 is my favorite. I don't really know why exactly, it's kind of counterintuitive, she's loud, slow, and kind of ugly(just like my wife heeyo).  But it's really just a pleasure to drive, it rides great, handles excellent, very comfortable and great for highway cruising.    I spent quite a long time looking for mine. I did some research on what to look for, and just patiently waited for the right one. I looked at probably fifteen before finally purchasing an 84 turbo, from a little old lady who'd taken excellent care of it had it regularly serviced at a dealership, she was the 2nd owner but had kept receipt since the car was new. It has 427000km on it ATM, and still going strong. I don't drive it tons, I've put maybe 6-8000 a year on it though, and I've had exactly zero issue with it. Everything except the sunroof works perfectly. The only major repairs since new were a trans and a head rebuild at 375k. Obviously experiences may vary but if you get a well maintained example it will give you years of faithful service. They really are every bit as good as you've probably heard.  Edit: Also I live near Seattle but I'm not selling it ha! Seriously though there's lots available, do it."

It takes crazy engineering to get enough airflow through this thing as it is being a uniflow head. I highly recommend an OM603 car, much more like a modern diesel and if your going to rebuild one you may as well find a wasted om603. OM603 is a strong motor as it is but it can support up to 500hp on stock internals. The OM60x motors are the best they ever made if you get a revised head and do the other small revisions (newer style con rod bolts, updated vac pump and a few other stupid things). You can also fit a MLS gasket on a 603. Much easier to work on, AC compressors that don't suck, serpentine belt, self adjusting valves, 80 amp stock alternator and another cylinder. Fyi, the pumps have to be sent to finland for more fuel and it costs like 2 grand. Nobody in USA has a bosch flow rate test bench for these old M pumps"

The compressor ran a long time trying to refill the air bags and overheated.  The bumpy ride is because you're riding on the stops, not the air bags.  Your mechanic can find the leak with some soapy water.  A new bag should be in the $200 range (parts cost). Labor will be steep, as much of the suspension will have to be taken apart."

At least drive it and put away what you can afford to every month until you can pay cash for what you want.  Earn interest.  Don't pay it.

The S class would cost a lot on its own, but the Brabus modification would cost just as much without the stock car! I bet the SL65 black would be way cheaper. I can't tell you how much they have depreciated, but they are quite rare still.   However, Brabus as a customization specialist can do projects for much cheaper. It depends on the features. Their flagship models like the 850 are always fully customized but I've seen several Brabus without much extra customization."

mercedes_benz,3aog48,Hoffmeisterfan,6,Mon Jun 22 14:25:34 2015 UTC,"In LA there are a lot of real AMGs with all the right badges and body kits and other obvious signatures of a real AMG. But still, I'll spot a different C250 ""AMG"" or S550 ""AMG"" every other day it seems. The worst is when someone will drop the third digit, so you see a 2015 S55 ""AMG"" with two extra exhaust pipes that don't connect to anything under the car. That's someone who seriously put in a good amount of effort to fake his already expensive S class. There are real AMG models, brand new and fully optioned up, that are worth less than an S550! (Like my edition 507 C63 for god's sake!) I wonder how these people rationalize their actions. They're undermining the intrinsic value and rarity of real AMGs everywhere!  The new badge style that MB is going with for newer models of AMGs like the w205 C63s, with AMG on the left side, will hopefully make it more difficult for people to fake.   ^ At least I thought that until I saw a w204 with the a fake AMG badge on the left side and a fake C63 badge on the right.... with an S class ""S"" next to the 63.

mercedes_benz,3anebz,six60six,10,Sun Jun 21 22:46:10 2015 UTC,"My 2013 C63 was called up on the lease ""pull forward"" program so I decided to see what the dealer had in stock.  Knowing that the new C400/450/63 were not available yet, I had little interest in a new W205 and after driving a C300 that was confirmed.  The new chassis just isn't as good as the old one IMO and the turbo I4 didn't really seem lively.  Then I decided to drive a E400, which again is the old chassis until 2017 and is a great car, but the lease payments were a little much for what is known to be a end-of-life platform and I feel like I see a TON of E350's around Chicago, so again it wasn't really doing it for me.  Then I spotted a 2015 CLA45 sitting in the corner next to a new AMG GT and decided to have a peak at it.  I will be the first to admit that I am not a fan of the CLA body styling and up to this point have only seen CLA250's on the road, which at their base trim just don't do it for me.  After talking to my salesman a little, I asked him to pull it out of the showroom so I could take it for a spin, which I felt bad for doing since they had to move the GT to get the CLA out.  After about a half hour or so of them jockeying cars around, it was sitting out front and he came up and handed me the keys and told me it was mine to take out without him and to please just not break it.  ""Break it?"" I thought, I own a C63, a car that will try to kill you when you simply poke it with a stick, how could this little CLA be any different? Wow was I in for a surprise.  Upon getting in I realized a few things, its small, its tight and the Recaro's just grab you.  The rear window is tiny and the rear view mirror is even smaller, the doors are super high compared to the W204 and the whole thing just seems to wrap around you.  I put it in manual mode, turned off the stability control and eased it out of the dealership parking lot.  Turning into traffic and not even giving it much pedal, it started snarling, popping and burping with every gear shift and I had to catch myself with the speed climbing way quicker than I thought the little I4 could manage.  Ok I thought, this thing is kind of fun, kind of like an angry rodent trapped in a cage just waiting for you to open the door.  It's not going to kill you, but you may get hurt.  Handling is crisp as expected, gear changes from the new double clutch are still a little sluggish but better than the old wet clutch system.  Overall it just feels like a fun car that you can use to it's full potential, which with my C63 was a recipe for disaster or bald tires every couple thousand miles.  So after a 20 minute test drive, I was sold and ended up taking a step down the AMG ladder, but a step into a car that should be fun for the next 2 years none the less.  TL/DR: Traded in my C63 for a CLA45 despite hating the body styling and also the AMG I4 Turbo is a crazy piece of engineering that makes hilarious sounds no matter how you drive it."

mercedes_benz,3anebz,MBGLK,3,Sun Jun 21 23:25:28 2015 UTC,I had 4 months left on a 27 month lease on the C63.  They waived the last 4 payments and the disposition fee as long as I rolled into another Mercedes.

mercedes_benz,3anebz,VividRacingofficial,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"I got a good residual on the car when I leased it, which is why I even did it in the first place, I believe it was 68-69% for 27 months.  On top of that I did manage to get them down quite a bit on the sticker which is rare on an AMG vehicle.  As for the buyout, I never even checked.  The maintenance alone on those cars gets expensive after 3 years which is why i usually only keep cars until they start needing larger routine maintenance items. Things like brake pads and rotors on a C63 at the dealership is close to $5k.  In the 17,000 miles I drove it, I went through 3 sets of rear tires to general fun and a pair of fronts from sidewall bulges which also got pricey @ $300 ea."

You open the doors and they just don't feel like a MB should.  It's 6 inches longer than the W204 (Even the CLA is 1"" longer than the W204) and just overall felt ""meh"" to drive.  Unfortunately the new C63 version, with it's great engine and AMG bits will still just be a ""meh"" chassis IMO.  As for the CLA not living up to the AMG name, I was right there with you until I drove it, that motor is something special and you can see where they're going with small displacement turbo engines in the future.  For a 1,991cc 2.0L to be making 180hp per liter with 27psi of boost and have a factory warranty is pretty impressive."

I emailed the manufacturer and they sent me this today. i don't know if it works, i haven't tried it yet.  Please try out the reset procedure below.  1.) Always make sure the car engine is off and all lights are turned off before the installation.  2.) Install the LED bulbs.  3.) After that, keep the engine off and turn on the light to see whether or not the LED bulbs light up.  4.) If the LED bulbs light up, then start the engine to check whether or not there's any error message on the dashboard.    a.) If there is no error message, that's a job well done.    b.) If there is an error message, please turn off the engine, lock the car and wait about 10 seconds to start the car and check again.    c.) You might need to turn your car off and on for a 3rd time because sometimes it takes two times to have the on-board computer reset itself.   5.) If the LED bulbs don't light up, turn off the light and car, rotate the LED 180 degrees and repeat step 3.  Remember to turn off the car and lock it to reset the on-board computer."

They have been very reliable despite everyone saying early 2000s Mercs were crap. Working on them isn't too bad, it's just tedious and sometimes tricky due to tight spaces. I am about to complete my engine swap on my 2001 430, putting in a 2003 clk55 engine. For perspective before starting this swap, I barely knew how to change a car's oil.   Regardless of whether you go w209 or the older w208 model, you won't be disappointed by the engine's reliability. the 430, 500 and 550, 55 are all the same m113 engine with different internals.   All this said, I just searched for both clk500s and clk55s. Nothing on the market right now (autotrader/ebay) appeared to be worth $14,000. However, this 2007 CLK550 is $14000 with 65,000 miles. Those have the 7 speed transmission which I have heard can be a bit more finnicky. My sister has had no issues with it in her 2006 c230 though."

Also keep in mind, a $14K CLK500 is going to need SOMETHING no matter what. The kind of people that own these cars only get rid of them when there's a large maintenance bill to be had. What is your yearly budget for tires?   I was sorta like you too. Are you in your 20s? It turns out owning a used MB is about a lot more than being able to afford the sticker price. You said you're not ""too concerned about moderately pricey repairs"". You can just remove the word moderately there, you have to be OK with pricey repairs. Remember the adage: the most expensive car is a cheap MB.  I won't discourage you from getting this car if it's what you want, I love it too. But you need closer to $20k for your first year with it if the sticker is $14k."

mercedes_benz,3ac7km,CGSColin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:48:50 2015 UTC,A few days/weeks late isn't going to hurt assuming it's been regularly maintained up until now and it's not being driven high miles between services.

mercedes_benz,3ac7km,notoriousKudi,2,Fri Jun 19 09:58:09 2015 UTC,Your first car is a CLK 55 AMG? First world problems...
mercedes_benz,3ac7km,twoplustwoequalstwo,3,Fri Jun 19 20:03:40 2015 UTC,"Do you know much about this high performance luxury car? The CLK 55 AMG was the top of the line CLK produced at the time. Designed by Mercedes' high performance division AMG. Upgrades from the regular CLK include a 5.4L 342hp V8 engine, stiffer suspension, performance exhaust, xenon headlights, a sunroof, rain-sensing wipers, multicontour front seats, front seat heaters and a rear sunshade.   In all honesty, this is a terrible first car- especially for a non enthusiast. I could see the justification if you were a big car guy but the cost to maintain it is going to be flat out not worth it.   Your talking about a car worth $15-20K (depending on condition and miles) which is going to cost you $1000 minimum to maintain per year. With possible repairs in the thousands. Just ask your aunt to see the service receipts from the last few years. Its value will also depreciate rapidly in the next few years down to the ~$10K mark. Im sure the V8 also isn't great on gas.  Its a very nice and generous gift from your Aunt but it would definitely be a wise decision to at least look at your other options for cars at the going rate of this car."

Models around this time (W203, W210, and W220) had rust issues on wheel arches and doors.   Airmatic is great when it works, car will be undrivable if it fails completely.   Instrument cluster screen can fade when the car is hot."
mercedes_benz,39ybwe,deutsch-technik,3,Tue Jun 16 00:36:38 2015 UTC,I've had several w220's and they all had their own problems. Airmatic wad a common theme of not working. One of them had an electrical problem with the sound system where the speakers in the back didn't work; mercedes told me to replace the entire sound system if I wanted it to work.   Probably the worst cars I've ever owned.
mercedes_benz,39ybwe,TILalot,2,Tue Jun 16 13:46:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in the market for a W220 as well, so I'm curious about this topic."

The airmatic issue mentioned is 100% true, the compressors will go out and will be expensive.  I've also experienced some of the electrical gremlins that are commonly mentioned -- things like various relays and switches that have needed replacing and are invariably about $800 each time.  Also minor electrical problems that I've just learned to live with -- for example one rear window won't express-up (even after resetting it with the suggested procedure) once out of every 4-5 times, the COMMAND system rebooting for no reason once in a while, rain sensing wipers ""freeze"" once in a while, etc.  Each single problem doesn't really happen often enough to pose a big problem and doesn't seem to be getting worse, so it's hard to justify the thousands of dollars it would take to fix them all.  I haven't heard of, nor have I experienced any water drain/clog problem.  On the plus side, the 500 engine is basically bulletproof provided the oil seal issue is addressed (and almost certainly would have been under warranty years ago by the original owner).  The interior trim and fit is fantastic.  I've had very little wear on the leather and trim pieces and they still look great.  No rattles or creaks or general ""old car sounds"" have ever developed.  I like the W220 styling and think it is aging gracefully.  It was such a radical departure from the W140 that it still seems modern (even if it won't pass for a W222) and has neat touches like the kinda-avant-garde-looking triangular, striped taillights that stand out."
mercedes_benz,39ybwe,andreirublev,2,Tue Jun 16 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"Looks like there's one compressor for the entire car. It also looks like a 15 minute/$350 replacement. To me, that's not bad at all.  I see the struts can be around $2000 for the whole car, which is in line with what I would expect. I have to wonder how durable the lines and fittings are between the compressor and the struts.  Which oil seal is the one that commonly fails?  I drove a 2005 S500 4Matic with 75k miles on it last year and it felt fantastic. It's probably for the best that I couldn't purchase it at the time. lol  I'm also a big fan of the styling, inside and out. Great proportions, excellent restraint and the interior is very comfortable and attractive. Thanks for the insight!"
mercedes_benz,39ybwe,andreirublev,2,Tue Jun 16 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"If I recall, in my case what happened was the strut's failures caused the compressor to burn up while it tried and failed to maintain pressure and I had to replace both front struts plus the compressor.  One other thing while on the topic of suspensions, it seems like I run through various wear parts at a really accelerated rate.  Stuff like bushings, ball joints, the occasional control arm.  Don't remember which seal, but it was early-on and while still under warranty.  I remember the service advisor saying there was a bulletin out on that issue and they pretty much just replaced it for every 500 engine that came in for anything whether a leak was present or not."
mercedes_benz,39ybwe,bsclifton,2,Tue Jun 16 18:25:29 2015 UTC,"I had a 2006 S430 for just over 3 years and it was a great car :) The Airmatic will likely go bad, at least in the front struts, near 100,000 miles. I got replacements from Arnott and replaced them myself at a cost of ~ $1300ish (and on top of that, you get a rebate of $75 per strut if you return the bad ones)  I never had any electrical problems. It was a solid car. Only thing I can think of that sucks was the motor for the rear sun shade broke. I looked up the part in EPC and got it fixed for under $200.  The soft close can go bad and is expensive to fix... But it's optional. And if you get a 4matic or non-AMG body kit, you'll be able to rotate the tires which is great.  The earlier years have more issues, but I'd highly recommend a 2005 or 2006"
mercedes_benz,39ybwe,ChuckinTucson,2,Wed Jun 17 03:04:03 2015 UTC,"I've owned probably a dozen or so Mercedes.  The '02 S500 I had was the most costly in terms of repairs.  If it wasn't the Airmatic, it was a check engine light, the passenger seat quit working, the plastic storage bins under the seats completely fell apart, several batteries, etc., etc.  But the #1 thing is the Airmatic."
mercedes_benz,39ybwe,BassPlayaYo,2,Fri Jun 19 03:34:18 2015 UTC,"I have a 2004 S430, great car for the person that knows how to fix things.  The Airmatic isn't as big a deal as some have mentioned.  If the compressor goes it's about $300 and easy to install.  If the front shocks go, they are 400-500 a piece and easy to install.  Water drain clogging?  You do need to stay on top the up keep of the car which means cleaning out leaves that may potentially block the drains."

I'm old enough to be your grandfather, but my first Mercedes was a 1972 280C that was a college graduation present from my parents.  I've owned over a dozen since and except for a W220 that was a hunk of junk, they've been great cars.  I've had some diesels that refused to die even with 300K miles on them.  I have a '14 C250 now and a '13 ML350 Bluetec.    A word of advice.  Follow the recommended maintenance as if your life depended on it.  Believe me, the life of your car depends on it.  Hopefully you have an owner's manual.  If not, they're available online.  Transmission fluid changes, brake fluid changes, radiator flushes, etc., should all be done when recommended.  Only use Mobil 1 synthetic oil.  The car will tell you when it needs to be serviced and what service is due.  Mercedes uses terms like Service A, Service B, Service C, Service D depending on what type of work needs to be done.  Again, welcome to the Mercedes Benz family.  You made an excellent choice."

Very hard to differentiate CL vs S class from that angle as the wheels are the same and only the outer cluster cover is slightly different.

I regularly drive 250mi round trip for business and many times I took the c-class loaner so I could put miles on another car.  Road noise was similar between the two cars (both pretty quiet), but the comfort and ride in the E class is quite a bit better and the interior (while still a little 'cheap' feeling), is nicer in the E. Steering input, braking, etc. were also all smoother and nicer in the E-class.   This was comparing an '09 E to '13 and '14 C class, so I'm not sure if anything has changed for current model year.

mercedes_benz,395peu,xirah11,5,Tue Jun 9 13:08:54 2015 UTC,"I just ordered the GLE 350 from my dealer about 2 months ago. Each dealer gets 5 vehicles ordered how ""they want""(they can change features based on what their customer base would want) so he took one of those and modified it for me. Out of the 5 they were getting, I got the 4th one. He then took what prices they had already listed in their dealer order guide, took the base ML350 price and added 2%(the most he's seen a refresh model increase in base price), then calculated what it would cost. They had to write out the order on paper but on it, they put a stipulation that if it comes in above a certain price(we decided on 500$ above what it would have cost me to get the ml350) or my fleet discount changes, then I have the option not to take it(the 1000$ deposit is refundable as well).  I have it custom ordered it with gray leather seats and black interior(check out the redline c400 review, that's what it will look like), premium package, heated steering wheel, harmon kardon, and it should arrive in the first 2 weeks of August(but realistically I'm thinking end of August). The new GLE 350 will have a lot more standard features than the ml350 so even though you don't get the 10% discount(think about why they are offering you a 10% discount too), you are getting a lot more features for the same price(see below for the dealer order guide). The interior sold me and from what I can tell with the c300, MB is trying to up the ante against the X5 by offering loads more as standard for the same price as the ml350. OH, I forgot, they are also adding agility control which is found in the c300; allows you to tune the suspension/steering/throttle to sport+, eco, standard mode--sport+ is AWESOME. IMO, the gle 350 is a brand new car without the problems of a brand new car(its a lot of cosmetic changes).  The ml350 is very outdated, the navigation and what not is very old and not nearly as nice as what comes in the c300(which is what will be in the gle350). It's high quality inside but it definitely feels like you're buying an older car if you will. I went to 4 dealerships and only ONE offered me the option or even told me about the gle 350; the rest were trying to push the ml350 on me. Talk to your dealer, see if they'll set it up this way(check for dealer incentives and fleet discounts, I get 2500$ off mine for fleet discount)  dealer order guide 1  dealer order guide 2  this is a pdf link with the available options/features for the canadian version. I'd assume the US GLE 350 will have the same features if not more than the GLE 350D  All of the above were found on the mbworld forum but it's the exact same as what he showed me at the dealership.   tl;dr: there's no reason to get the ml350 over the GLE 350 unless you're tight on cash, in which case maybe a mercedes isn't the best choice of vehicle lol."

mercedes_benz,395peu,mmtree,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Most of the dealers I've spoken with have pushed the ML as well. Only had one speak about the GLE, but it's because I brought it up.  I'm thinking it's best to wait. Lexus did the same darn thing to me with the RX -- and now I sit in it and am not happy with the rounded shape & outdated interior. It seems if I went with the ML, it would be the same thing again.  The P1 package on the '16 literally adds every single option I was needing to add to the '15 to get what I want. I'd just need to add the running boards & leather/wood steering wheel & heated seats, but the majority of that is pretty standard on dealer lot vehicles in this area. I'm probably going to keep to MBtex since I like black interior and I live in TX. The leather is just too hot at most points in the year.   On the other hand, I probably might opt for sport appearance packages both on the exterior and interior which would definitely need a dealer order I'm sure.  If I don't go that route, I almost wonder if I would even need to bother in ordering at that point or just should wait until they hit the lots and pick it up toward the end of the year since I have a pretty standard vehicle at that point. Then again, not really in a rush per se since I do have some potential lease takeover options from people at work on my Lexus because I got an insanely good deal on it.  Not too worried on price. Ideally would like to get it $60K or less OTD, but if I have to spend a bit extra, I'm fine with that too. I'm guessing that the GLE would still fit that budget."
mercedes_benz,395peu,mmtree,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There's a reason they are pushing ML350's out the door instead of telling customers about the GLE350--quick profit and they reduce their inventory to make space for the newer vehicles. The Lexus Rx was actually designed for women--softer ride and looks-- which is why Lexus came out wit the F-sport to attract men. The Rx is a great vehicle, but it's no X5 or ML/GLE which are designed for performance(german cars are tuned for higher torque at lower RPM because of the autobahn compared to japanese cars, although for reliability japanese cars are top notch). The ML350 as is, and the Lexus Rx, both came out around the same time I believe so yea, getting the ml350 would be side stepping as opposed to upgrading in terms of interior(I looked at pretty much every SUV in this category before making my decision).   If you have time, go to your local dealer and see what type of package they can put together for you. I love the mbtex but couldn't give up the opportunity to go the contrasting colored leather(Plus, michigan doesn't get that hot lol). The sport package and what not is nice, but I'd be careful as on the ML350, I honestly can't tell the difference in exterior features between sport non-sport as MB seems to be moving towards AMG/sport exterior for all their vehicles(interior is different)--I did opt for the chrome hood fins and apparently now that also includes chrome handles which will look nice against the black exterior.   Packages wise, from what I was told on the ml350, almost all of them come with the premium package plus some extra little features which may or may not be the same in your area(I'd assume ventilated seats are a highly sought after option). Mine came out just around 59k without including the fleet discount, taxes, title so OTD I am looking at about 59k(without leather and fleet discount you should be at this price). Heated seats for the front are standard btw.  For ordering, the only thing I wonder is whether or not your dealership will have any for you to take come July/August. They may have floor models that are fully loaded but inventory might be sparse to begin with--it was like that with the c300 for the first few months. Considering I got the 4th out of 5 floor models the dealership was going to get, I'm not sure if they still get their 5 for inventory(so 9 total to their dealership), or if they'll just get the 1 as a floor and require people to order it. I'd check sooner than later so it can get put into processing."
mercedes_benz,395peu,drmlee,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"unless you're getting a huge discount, I would wait for the GLE.  I would hate driving my new car for such short period of time and then it becomes the ""old"" model.  my audi guy called me the other day trying to get me into an A8 and offered me $15k off msrp + rebates and incentives because their trying to move inventory.  I still didn't take it the deal as im not really a big fan of the car.  10% off and free maintenance wouldn't sway me to get the current ML.  if you like the body and don't mind driving the past model, wait until the GLE's start hitting showroom floors and they'll discount even more."

Been very active on a lot of MB forums for years and there are some who insist that it causes unnecessary wear and tear on these old engines. Sure, they can run it with almost no modifications (replace all fuel lines with metal as biodiesel corrodes rubber) but it's also not quite as healthy for the engine long term. There's not much cost benefit to running biodiesel in most places and having to replace an engine completely negates any fuzzy warm ""green"" feelings you had by running it."

It's just too convenient to fill up on the road and I can't take the mess and smell sometimes. I'm most likely going to take the kit out, clean the trunk and move on. It was interesting and fun for a while, but it's just unnecessary hassle these days. No idea what to do about the extra wvo though..."

The C would touch the part of the curb that was on the road while my CLA would not. It was probably on par with our ML or just a tad better (which is still pretty good).
mercedes_benz,3873pc,mrgandw,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:59:41 2015 UTC,I had a loaner W205 while mine was in at the dealer recently and I noticed the turning circle was just slightly wider. Looking it up online just now it looks like the W205's turning radius is just over 1 foot wider than the W204's (36.8 feet vs. 35.6 feet).

mercedes_benz,3834av,SamTheSammich,3,Mon Jun 1 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with the SL was that they were trying too hard to be 'modern' when they designed it.  Contemporary designs date cars very quickly.  The R129 body style still looks relatively modern (timeless) in part--I think--to the minimalist approach.

While I haven't had major issues regarding wiring harnesses in my w210, the passenger side headlight harness did get brittle enough to cause problems.  Was able to pull the light and replace it for about $25 or so plus an hour of my time.  Another thing to be aware of is the older w210s had spring perch rusting problems, so keep an eye out for that too.  Other than that it's been a solid car for me, had it since 30k miles and now it's just about at 165k.  Keep up on scheduled maintenance and you shouldn't see any significant issues."

mercedes_benz,37zxd2,Extortion187,11,Sun May 31 20:38:21 2015 UTC,It's a 2008 C300 Sport. I take so much pride into my car because I'm paying it off all by myself. I treated my self to this car because I have been running my own business for a little over 2 years and have well enough to pay the car payments on it. I've had it since September and it's still going strong!
mercedes_benz,37zxd2,Sniperboy06,5,Sun May 31 20:40:59 2015 UTC,May I ask what kind of business you are running? You started your business at age 15?

I started fixing them for friends when I turned 16, then by the power of social media, more and more high schoolers came to me. I believe I was credible because I was top 10 in my high school class. Well, when I turned 18 in November I started advertising throughout the city and made business cards. Now I get business everyday from random people and from people in the surrounding cities. My prices are way cheaper than the stores in town and I live in a city of 125,000 so there isn't much competition."

My secret was spending about 10k replacing literally everything the first year and its been so good to me. Eventually my motor got old and got a rod knock (drove it for 10k like that and it never let go) so i spent 3k on a motor 25,000miles ago and its been amazing.

Main issues are rust and sometimes the timing chain on these engines stretch and start to rattle. Even so, if you live in an area that doesnt salt the roads, and the oil has been changed according to schedule you should be good."
mercedes_benz,38031v,Rabben,2,Sun May 31 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"You found a great car! I recently got into an accident where my '99 C230K was totalled and got ~5K for it. So they hold their value incredibly well. I never had any major issues with it. Go get the Bentley service manual and search around some boards. There is a massive amount of info on your car.   Find out when the timing chain was done (if it was). Other than that you can look into slowly changing out the suspension parts. Mine was about at your mileage and was starting to need parts. Front LCA bushings, ball joints, a couple small steering components. Check your flex disc! It's an easy part to change, but if it fails then your in a nasty situation. I think it's one of the only parts that can catastrophically fail. The parts are easy to find. I would probably check on the flex disc and timing chain before anything else, besides maybe changing the oil.   If you have the kompressor then look into some posts on oil in the MAF. Basically you need to go in and clean out the intake manifold and periodically clean out the MAF itself. It's time consuming, but not hard. If you don't have it then ignore this part!  Let me know if you need or want some more info. Always glad to help!"
