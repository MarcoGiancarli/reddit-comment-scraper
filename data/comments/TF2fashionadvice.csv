Not sure what though, I don't mess with Scout loadouts often.  Soldier is good. Someone mentioned Cold Snap Coat with is a pretty good idea too.  Your Pyro is cute and shiny, I like it. Wouldn't tell you to change a thing.  That Demoman is Cool. He looks really serious, like he's about to ruin someone's day. Good one.  The Heavy is unique and I like that. It's a little weird because it doesn't fit most expectations of a Heavy but I think that's a good thing.  The Engie is a solid, very usable loadout. I feel like you could take more risks with it though. Maybe mix up the colors or swap out the coat.  That is one stylish Medic, I like it a lot. Keep it as is.  Sniper is good. I think I saw something similar here a few weeks ago, was that the inspiration? It's good but nothing amazing.  The Spy is perfect. It's simple, laid back, and has a Spycrab. I love my Spycrab too!

TF2fashionadvice,3dtmk6,Tacomastr,4,Sun Jul 19 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not that guy but I agree with him.  The Bruiser's Bandana is getting way too much use and it's not as versatile as people seem to think it is.  Painting it almost any color is sure to ruin what it does best which is to discreetly obscure the face and draw attention to other parts of the loadout. A white one with your white KE will not look good.   With your KE obscuring the face shouldn't be a goal unless you have some eye/mid face cosmetic you want to accentuate. You need to look for thematic and stylish items like suits/clothes, facial hairs, maybe a good pair of glasses. Those will look best with your hat.  A Spy specific problem is the stupid cigarette poking through it. I really hate that.  In summary, if you're not interested in looking unique or stylish the go ahead and use the BB. It's honestly overpriced garbage on most loadouts, especially when people paint it stupid colors."

TF2fashionadvice,3dtmk6,AverageGuardLucas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"Recognizable two hat combo for each class? Nah man, all of the good combos (and even most of the bad) have been taken. Most popular youtubers have just one hat that makes them them.   Sure, you get people like Scottjaw and Blu, who have the two and three cosmetic combo for every class, but just because they can sport their look well, doesn't mean you have to do the same. If you want to make a distinguishable look, I recommend you just stick with the KE and the loadouts given to you by the gentleman/lady up at the top of this thread.  You definitely do not want to obscure and cover up the face with the Killer Exclusive. This hat slants up, which points to and accents the character's face and anything directly below the face. You'll need a moustache or beard, or glasses, and a nice jacket or piece of clothing.  Once you become more popular, you could even start thinking about getting yourself an unusual KE, which will make people instantly recognize you. (i.e. Muselk's kill-a-watt Exquisite Rack with the point and shoot, Uncle Dane's Miami Nights Danger, etc)"
