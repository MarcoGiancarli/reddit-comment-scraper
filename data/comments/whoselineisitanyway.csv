When a TV show getabput on the following Friday night line up...it means the network is gonna pull the plug soon. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot Whose line has always been on Friday night. Probably because the cost of the show is lower in comparison to a TV series. Whose line is also considered a game show, because it costs less money in the end than to call it a comedy show. I forgot the reason.   All in all, the move just means free summer slots because pilots were not picked up, or shows set canceled and thus needed a slot to fill. Regardless of the reason, this should be a ratings boost for whose line."
whoselineisitanyway,3bnqy5,Darksing,6,Wed Jul 1 03:31:13 2015 UTC,"Friday night death slot:       The ""Friday night death slot"" is a perceived graveyard slot in American television. It implies that a television program in the United States scheduled on Friday evenings (typically, between 8:00 and 11:00 p.m. ET) is destined for cancellation.  The term possibly began as a reflection of certain shows' dominance of Friday night in the 1980s and 1990s, which condemned to death any television show scheduled opposite those programs.    Today, it reflects the belief that young, single Americans rarely watch television on Friday or Saturday nights, thereby removing from the household the most lucrative demographic for advertisers.

Back when Season 3 aired; (Bare with me it's sort of a loaded explanation) We were given Episode 327 (Going by prod. number) The first time aired, it was uncensored and the Drew game was actually Quick Change! And this episode was aired during the 10PM slot rather than the original 8PM slot, (Also being dubbed as ""Too Hot For 8PM""); Even odder is that 327 was aired back-to-back with ep 326(Episode prod number 326), and was actually made to seem like one episode (Even 327's credit reading was slashed to make it seem as if it was one episode. Heck originally, 326, the episode that followed, had Brad Sherwood listed in the credits!). That was the first airing of that episode anyhow.   The story for episode 334 (What I believe is listed as ep 322 on CwSeed??) was with its original airing, Props was the Drew Game for that one. Both episodes were re-edited for syndication, Both episodes swapping Drew Games (327 getting Props, 334 getting Quick Change); 327 getting re-edited and censored (For the If You Know What I mean line) to make less raunchy.  What I'm pretty sure happened with CW Seed is. WB gave them the original tape to Episode 334, but was given the Re-Edited Episode 327.   and That was Whose Line History 101! XD"

When people states that the show is modular, and they have bits that can be used to make the show comes together; Aisha saying will be right back, etc. I still believe that that includes the audience laughing. There are things that are funny, yes, but there and jokes where they are a tad funny, but they getincredible audience response.

Because I haven't been watching a lot of the new series, but I caught an episode with the Indian guy from the Big Bang Theory the other day and thought it was edited horribly.  There were audience claps and laughter when behind Aisha, the audience were still as a rock. There were people clapping and murmuring when there was silence on the soundtrack. During one of the games (Scenes from a Hat), Aisha could be heard buzzing multiple times in quick succession, but the game continued, then ended with no buzzer being pushed. People jumped around in the scene and before and after commercials, there were absolutely no ""We'll be right back"" or ""Welcome back"" moments. I thought it was edited horribly and the comedy suffered for it."

whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,SalemDrumline2011,5,Sun Jun 7 11:37:15 2015 UTC,Most episodes I find myself skipping the games with the guests. They just aren't funny.
whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,jkerber19,9,Sun Jun 7 14:25:36 2015 UTC,So do something about it. I bet you literally 0 people at The CW have seen this subreddit. Find someone to email. Find someone to tweet. Find someone to take your complaints.   This is a community for the discussion and APPRECIATION of Whose Line is it Anyway. All I ever see anymore is complaining anymore.
whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,SalemDrumline2011,2,Sun Jun 7 07:33:15 2015 UTC,I've noticed with how they tape that they get to episodes out of 1 session. I assume the CW adds guests because it helps viewer numbers. I think a nice compromise would be to only have one guest per taping. This would give you an episode where there guest is on (1-2 games depending on funny they are) and 1 with just the 4 comedians. I think this would be a nice compromise.
whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,SirHoneyDip,2,Sun Jun 7 03:32:34 2015 UTC,"Seriously?! ENOUGH! Brad was in more games than the guest. If you must complain about something, and something good; Complain about the editing. Literally you have a 3 hour taping, consisting of 20-24 games; Guests taking up 3-5 games there, Then the rest of the time its different games and it involves the fourth seater, a lot (unless Colin and Ryan game or Greatest Hits on a show that involves a non singing fourth seater, but I digress). Find the editor, maybe a CW representative(?) and then send them your complaints, tell them you want more variety in the game line ups or such.   And you know, guests have been hit or miss this season; Heather was a hit in the two games she was in; (Btw be thankful cause it could've been 3-4 games. But thankfully the editor was wise to cut that down)"
whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,12Medbe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:43:18 2015 UTC,Guests on the CW version are always a miss. No exception. They ruin the chemistry entirely.
whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,Digging_For_Ostrich,-1,Sun Jun 7 05:26:50 2015 UTC,Gee where was everyone when Season 5 came out and the special guests started being brought on? Where was the outrage then?
whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,12Medbe,6,Sun Jun 7 09:48:57 2015 UTC,"Special guests in the old whose line didn't pop up as often. This is an extremely huge point because there aren't many games that can feature a special guest (making funny improv is hard and it's not polite to throw them into a fire); it's largely limited to dubbing, living scenery, and helping hands (with some exceptions, like when Jerry Springer did the talk show game and when Hasselhoff did the 3 headed broadway star). This is a major issue because when the guests appear too often, you start hamfisting the same games into the lineup to feature them, and it makes the episodes feel very repetitive.  For example, season 5 only had about 10 guests in a 34 episode season, which is slightly more than 25% of the episodes. Season 9 had 12 episodes and had special guests in 11 of them.  Season 5 had dubbing appear 5 times (mostly showing up when they had the special guest). 5 out of 34 episodes = ~15%. Season 9 had dubbing appear 5 times, but in only a 12 episode season, that's 42%.  Season 5 had living scenery appear 7 times in 34 episodes. (again, mostly showing up when they had the special guest). Season 9 had it appear 6 times in 12 episodes. And I could go on and on.  It also doesn't help that these games tend to play out in a very similar way. Dubbing involves colin and ryan fighting over the affection of the special guest. Helping hands involves Colin stuffing nasty food into Ryan's mouth. These games can be funny, but they can't appear too often.  One way to make the new special guests more appreciated is trying to find games that aren't one of the limited selection to feature them. For example, imagine if a singer came on and improv'd a duet game with Wayne, instead of having Wayne (and the 4th seater when applicable) singing to the guest. THAT would be interesting to see. Even doing something simple, like having 2 special guests and making them do moving people with Colin and Ryan, or having a special guest do 2 line vocabulary, would be a breath of fresh air. But again, improv is hard, and it's why the special guests are usually limited to a small set of games.  So yes, you are right in that the rage should be directed at CW and the editors and not the special guests themselves. There have been funny special guests just like there have been boring special guests. But it doesn't change the fact that the new episodes are simply not as funny as the old ones, and the repetitiveness of the episodes is a major contributing factor, and the reason why there was significantly less outrage over the special guests in the old episodes is that they simply appeared less often than they do now."
whoselineisitanyway,38tx9u,smash_fanatic,2,Sun Jun 7 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we should develop a thread here discussing what would make guests better on the show. Two Line Vocabulary is a good start, yes."

whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,andy3620,32,Sun May 24 20:29:48 2015 UTC,"She's been pretty funny this season; She has been letting them be funny and as for her jokes; so far they've been editing in more of her jokes this season.   Let me say, It took me a little while to get used to Aisha. I absolutely adore her as host now. Yes I loved Drew, still do; but I've gotten used to Aisha's hosting and up to this point she's gotten used to the gig and really has come out of her shell. Fantastic host."
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,Shappie,7,Sun May 24 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed, she's definitely connected with the cast a bit more and you can really see it.  My hope is that next season she's comfortable enough to actually be in a game at the end!  I'd love to see her improv."
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,jerryFrankson,6,Mon May 25 03:44:21 2015 UTC,"Haven't been watching the new season much, but there was one scene where she spontaneously joined a scene.

I felt as you do, but this changed my view of her.  I have 2 conclusions:   She's better at offensive humor than clean humor She's playing straight-man more than the other hosts and letting the comics shine.   She's surprisingly freaking hilarious if she lets herself be."
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,spankymuffin,5,Mon May 25 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she's pretty funny in Tabletop.  Here's the thing: she doesn't need to be funny in Whose Line. In fact, she probably shouldn't be too funny. She's the host, not a performer. She's more or less doing the same thing Drew did, except Drew had a few more jokes made at his expense. Aisha will catch up to that I'm sure. But otherwise, she's doing just fine."
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,novagenesis,1 point,Mon May 25 04:10:28 2015 UTC,I'm 50/50 on agreeing.  She's a little less engaging with quality humor than Clive or Drew were (or at least Clive...for some reason I never got into the second Whose Line).  Admittedly they were all 3 mostly there to be facilitators instead of humorists.... But Clive at least stood on his own and it worked.
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,spankymuffin,1 point,Mon May 25 14:33:53 2015 UTC,"Eh. I never really had strong feelings one way or the other about Clive. Honestly, the same pretty much goes for the other hosts. Although Drew may have been my favorite of the bunch only because he was an easy target for everyone to make fun of. So that produced a bunch of laughs. That's not really something to credit him personally for, as a host and performer. He was just pudgy and successful from his sitcom, so everyone naturally used him as the butt of some jokes. I don't remember too much of that with Clive and Aisha.   But as I said, I really don't care too much about the hosts. What they do and say is not particularly memorable. And that's ok."
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,Freak4Dell,2,Mon May 25 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"Then she should start showing some of that offensive humor on the show. It's not like the show doesn't have some raunchy moments. I'm sure the producers could handle a few insults from Aisha. Drew used to insult the guys, too (granted, they hit him twice as hard). So far, I can't recall any of her jokes that were funny. There was the time she joined in on the Jeff Davis Scenes From a Hat clip, which was hilarious, but she didn't actually say anything that time."
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,novagenesis,0,Mon May 25 03:47:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no it's true.  She might just be trying to find her step still, or maybe the producers felt they wanted a less front-and-center host (perhaps that's why they went from an increase in celeb status to Drew Carey to a decrease in celeb status to Aisha... If they wanted a high profile host, I'd think Wayne Brady would've been the pick, with both higher celeb status and hosting experience?  I have this odd feeling Whose Line could've gotten him on the show...)"
whoselineisitanyway,373q6u,gigantism,1 point,Mon May 25 14:36:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like most of the humor that came from Drew was self-deprecating from the banter with the performers. There isn't really much they can jab at Aisha for, though, since it's just easier (and more socially acceptable) to pull off poking fun at a rotund white guy than it is an attractive black woman even if both are accomplished comedians.  I do remember one of the performers referring to Aisha's role in Friends the first season, though, which was pretty cool. And I want to say that she's mentioned her Archer role before, but mostly to deflect attention off of it since it's from a different network."

whoselineisitanyway,36ntn9,baconatbacon,26,Wed May 20 19:21:47 2015 UTC,"Time to go off-book. Clive was better than both. I liked Clive because he was the entire premise of the show. He was this buttoned down relatively proper British gent who was trying to maintain the façade of the show having some decorum and structure and rules and purpose. His straight-arrow manner was the perfect fodder for the eccentric cast to gang up on in a ""common enemy"" sort of motif.  On the other hand, Drew always seemed like he wanted to be part of the joke and join in and be one of the cool kids and the cast just wanted to make fun of him. He was incapable of taking the show seriously and basically make the whole framing device of a ""game show"" and basically rolled his eyes at it every episode. Maybe it wasn't his intent, but it came off to me as him being disrespectful to the show and its premise and not willing to play along with the conceit that the show was supposed to be a ""real"" game show with a ""real"" winner. I'm sure the producers/network also have some blame in that as well, but that's my feeling. What Drew did have is still a sense of that common enemy. There was a feeling that he did have some friendly rivalry/ribbing with the cast. The ""prize"" of the show being a sketch that Drew gets to be in just came off to me like a very self-centered demonstration that Drew didn't really want to be a host, he wanted to be one of the cast, and when he does those games he seems to come off very smug. I dunno why, but I just get the feeling that he takes those opportunities to as a chance to say ""see? I'm as good as all of these guys"".  Aisha, on the other hand basically comes off as the cast's best friend. There's minimal joking at her expense and more often they play to her and try to embarrass her rather than insult(perhaps the difference between how guys treat women vs. men).  I find that she equals Drew is the sense that she gives no credence to the ""game show"" premise, but for some reason (perhaps Drew's destruction of the premise for all those seasons before her), I don't mind it as much because she doesn't come off as if she's mocking the game show premise like Drew did. She doesn't give the ""game show"" much attention, but she doesn't say things like ""If you’re keeping track of the score, I pity you."" like Drew did.  In preference between Drew and Aisha, I prefer Aisha. She just seems to fit the ""host"" role better."
whoselineisitanyway,36ntn9,TheHYPO,12,Wed May 20 20:22:12 2015 UTC,Good points. Its interesting to note however that Drew didn't want to participate in any of the games at the beginning of the shows run. He was forced to go to improv classes & forced to play games by the network so they could get more ratings.
whoselineisitanyway,36ntn9,TheRedLazer,10,Thu May 21 00:00:46 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's interesting information. And a bit sad, I think. Everything for the ratings, I guess.   But in Drew's defence I've never seen him doing any improv where he doesn't look like he's truly enjoying himself. I read somewhere in the later years that one of his favorite things to do now is to do improv with the guys."
whoselineisitanyway,36ntn9,Novelsea,3,Thu May 21 07:56:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah Drew was not an improv comedian at all, it was only after he worked with some of the best that he really started having fun with it, he consistantly got better as the show went on. Another note is that Drew didn't want to host it either, he thought he would butcher it but the network was not interested in getting Whose Line, so he signed on to host that way Ryan, Colin, Wayne & co could work their magic for American audiences."
whoselineisitanyway,36ntn9,TheRedLazer,5,Thu May 21 22:05:58 2015 UTC,"Clive suffers from some ""non-Clive"" problems: The British show plays way too much film and theatre styles, for instance.  But as a host, in style, he's by far the best."
whoselineisitanyway,36ntn9,WilyDoppelganger,2,Thu May 21 06:17:04 2015 UTC,"In later UK series (3 through 7 were particular highlights for me) that just isn't true, and when they did play of the audience still shout out loads of TV anyway, once prompting Greg Proops to ask the audience if they've ever seen live actors do anything, so it never gets too serious, and it really was one of the best games to get a mix of people doing some fun stuff.  What they replaced clever and varied sketches in F&T Styles with is a shitload of stupid games with the same cast members doing the same things, rather than a better overall variety between game and participants."

But since we're on this question, I'm starting to prefer Aisha; Don't get me wrong I'll always have a place for Drew in my heart, as well his time as Whose Line Host. Aisha so far has brought a new dynamic, and starting Late Season 10 to the new season right now, she's really upped the energy, practically matching Drew's. She's fantastic.  Now if this were a ""Do you prefer Clive, Drew, or Aisha?"" question, then I might have a problem even coming up with an answer, because I love all three!"
whoselineisitanyway,36ntn9,12Medbe,3,Wed May 20 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"All three provide the show with a different personality, and I really like that. I think a lot of Whose Line fans started watching with Drew, and don't really like the change because Aisha is very different from Drew."

They were all friends (or seemed enough like it) and had collaborated in other work that made their jokes seem more personal. I'd love to see him as a guest too. Watching him crack up and his contagious laughter when he was supposed to ""run"" the show was always great. There's something much more humanizing about bringing Drew down as the butt of the joke and getting him laughing uncontrollably too.  I think especially when Aisha first took over, they were kind of dancing around some jokes that may have been offensive, the dynamic of having her as a female and a visible minority may have switched things up a bit so there's very little at her expense relative to the shit they've said about Drew and Clive.  My beef with Clive is that he always used to cut the skits off so early! I'm eager to see how he hosts the revival though."

That Richard Simmons episode was funny and all, but hugely overrated.

Let them sing w/Wayne or Wayne/Singer Fourth seater to an audience member. Song Styles becoming Duet (Wayne/Guest) and Duet becoming Trio (Wayne/Fourth/Guest); Perhaps one occasion the special guest joins Wayne or Wayne/Fourth in Greatest Hits.   *Little more frequent on Three Headed Broadway Star; Either Wayne/Fourth/Colin to Guest or Fourth/Guest/Ryan to Audience Member.  *On rare occasions switch it up on Sound Effects; Both one audience member and the special guest provide the Sound Effects. (Imagine if they got Michael Winslow and he played the game!!)  *Daytime Talk Show (Take a look at the Jerry Springer playing!)  *Questions; We saw it with Cedric yes, but why not have all five do it (All Four + Guests)   *Scenes From a Hat; On a few occasions perhaps we should see them with the other four, trying the game."

whoselineisitanyway,36dlsg,_Burgers_,2,Mon May 18 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"As others have said switch up the games. There are only so many times that helping hands can be funny, and for most people we're already past that.  There have been a few guests that are able to at least look like they are enjoying themselves and almost seem useful, so I'm not completely opposed to guests, but it gets repetitive and boring when the ones that never say a line come on. I'd like to see some of the other CW people come on, like Grant Gustin joining in a singing game instead of the constant helping hands and living scenery.  If the episode would be funnier with a cardboard cutout then you might as well skip the guest"
whoselineisitanyway,36dlsg,obesemobile,2,Tue May 19 01:12:11 2015 UTC,The problem with guests is that...  1) They're appearing in too many episodes.  2) They're appearing in too many games.  3) The types of games they appear in are too limited.  There's a problem when the guest appears in more episodes than one of the performers. The limited number of games also means episodes are starting to feel very repetitive.
whoselineisitanyway,36dlsg,smash_fanatic,1 point,Tue May 19 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'd still say ditch the guests entirely. I really don't think they add anything worth keeping, and they get pushed into the same 3 or 4 games every time where virtually every time they just haven't been able to keep up with the cast.  And for that matter, I'd rotate the cast more. I'd much prefer to see 2 of the 3 regulars + 2 guest seats rather than the 3 current ones. Back in the 90s I found some of my favourite performers watching WILLA UK and for the vast majority of those shows there were no regulars."

whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Hartf1jm,13,Sun May 10 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're going to find anyone here who disagrees with you. The vast majority of guests add absolutely nothing and they severely limit which games they can do. Helping hands was fun when they did it once in a while but Colin jamming food into Ryan's mouth isn't nearly as funny when you see it every episode. And I've never been crazy about living scenery, but I really don't like seeing it all the time."
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Hugo_Hackenbush,3,Sun May 10 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I was really surprised Friday when the guest appeared 3 separate times.  He was into it and that's great but definitely not what I care to see.  I mean, there is already a guest every week (the 4th person on stage).  I'd prefer if they chose extras from the studio audience for the occasional skit."
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Howardzend,10,Mon May 11 00:25:18 2015 UTC,"I wish they had more audience involvement and pushed the special guests to (at most) once every 5 episodes.  Song styles with a random audience member could be entertaining, but the game I am missing the most is Sound Effects with audience members. Having a baby on a roller coaster anyone?"
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Keica,2,Sun May 10 16:36:27 2015 UTC,I recall somewhere that people suffered from extreme stage fright the more involved they had to be.  Which is probably why Scene With an Audience Member didn't last long.
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,UpgradeTech,2,Sun May 10 22:45:54 2015 UTC,"I've gone to a couple Whose Live shows when they come to my hometown and they still use audience participation. For one game they asked for volunteers (i.e. moving people)  And for some other games they just call out random people in the audience. For example, I was called on by Greg Proops to give my cousin's profession for song styles. (I was sitting with my arms crossed because I was cold, but having a great time & I guess he thought I looked grumpy). It was a fantastic show though!  If I remember correctly I think they also picked random people for sound effects. Everyone at the shows I was at was happy to participate, and they seem really into it on the show too, like jumping into games like Hollywood Director to be Wayne's posse. On the off chance that they do pick someone that wants nothing to do with the show, it is tv they could always edit it out.  Since they were still using random audience members at the last touring show I went to (in 2014), I'm guessing the prominence of special guests is more CW's doing for promotion rather than audience awkwardness, but it's an interesting theory :)  P.S. I'm personally happy that Scene with an Audience member didn't last long, I didn't find it all that funny, but I wish they'd bring back Sound Effects!"
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Keica,1 point,Tue May 12 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"It does seem like they've been pushing audience interactions for the past few episodes, albeit in the same games.  It's starting to feel a bit forced though, or at they at least show too much, but I wouldn't mind Sound Effects coming back and other games that members of the audience participate in."
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,titanium-of-chasm,1 point,Mon May 11 08:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, Wayne does an excellent job of frequently incorporating the audience into Hollywood Director.   They are playing some of my favourite games just about every episode, but it would be nice if they could mix up the games a bit more, so we're not getting the same games episode after episode."
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Keica,4,Tue May 12 00:17:17 2015 UTC,Jaime Camil was pretty good a couple days ago!
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,gesunheit,5,Mon May 11 00:28:35 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I don't watch Whose Line for the guest stars, I watch for Colin, Ryan, Wayne, and whoever is in chair #4. Having guests all the time means we see the same few games over and over again, and that doesn't leave much time for anything else. As much as I used to like Helping Hands I'm honestly getting a little tired of it now. Awesome games like Sound Effects and Infomercial don't get much air time anymore. The show seems to be centered around the guest stars rather than the comedians."
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,gathayah,3,Sun May 10 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"Some of the 4th chair guests have been extremely underused. They really need more air time to shine for the audience, because some of them are quite hilarious & they're barely used."
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Keica,1 point,Tue May 12 00:18:37 2015 UTC,It doesn't help that Aisha Tyler isn't nearly as funny as Drew Carey.
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Swtcherrypie,10,Sun May 10 16:50:56 2015 UTC,Here we go...
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,SalemDrumline2011,1 point,Sun May 10 20:18:16 2015 UTC,I like some of the guests.  It'd be cool if they used guest stars from some Arrow or The Flash.  Still unsure why we haven't seen anything from either of those shows when we can get Lauren Cohen (AMC) or The Mountain (HBO).
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,Shappie,1 point,Tue May 12 06:28:47 2015 UTC,"The big problem with the guest stars is not so much that they're worse than the actual comedians (they're generally not as funny but they're alright), but that the games they do with them are very limited and it really restricts what games are played, and that's why the episodes are feeling repetitive, and this is a problem when over half the episodes have guest stars.   Each episode only has 5-6 games The games that involve guest stars generally include Song Styles/Duet, Living Scenery, Dubbing, and Helping Hands. These games aren't inherently bad, but when they show up nearly every single episode, they start to wear out their welcome.    After watching a bunch of the old US episodes recently, I feel like song styles/duet popped up once every 2-3 episodes, and then one of the last three would show up every 2-3 episodes. That's about the right dose for those games. In the reboot, song styles/duet pops up almost every single episode (generally the guest star is introduced in this), and then one of the three games shows up to feature the star again. That's too much of the same games."
whoselineisitanyway,35i0z8,smash_fanatic,1 point,Thu May 14 08:14:51 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really wish they didn't have so many guests. I guess they are doing it to bring new people to the show, but it must be backfiring. I have not cared/known of any of the guests so far.  Aisha is still annoying too. I can almost tolerate the horrid raspy shouting she does at the start of every show, but she also doesn't hit the buzzer at as good a times as Drew/Clive did, and she seems to repeatedly pick tame audience suggestions or even change them to something boring/politically correct.  That being said, I will continue to watch it because Ryan, Colin, and Wayne continue to make me laugh hard even with the shortcomings of this new whose line."

whoselineisitanyway,35cosj,MagnifloriousPhule,3,Sat May 9 02:28:56 2015 UTC,"They did do Questions with Cedric and I believe with another guest. Anyway!

whoselineisitanyway,35cosj,-Mountain-King-,2,Sun May 10 05:41:00 2015 UTC,It's because those games are the ones which require the least from the guest.
whoselineisitanyway,35cosj,Gofunkiertti,6,Sat May 9 02:42:16 2015 UTC,Jaime Camil Didn't need help though. Once they realised how good he was I would have pushed him to do some harder improv.

whoselineisitanyway,35cosj,dubblechzburger,3,Sun May 10 09:34:45 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the guest this week. He really got into the games and for me that made it even more awesome.

It's good, and it's gotten much better over time with Aisha, but it's still not as good as it was in the Drew era. The host does matter. Sure, it doesn't really make a difference who introduces the game, but what made Drew so great was his banter and his laugh. He had a chemistry with the cast that Aisha does not. He's worked with a lot of them on his own show, which is why I don't think Aisha will ever get that same chemistry. Plus, Drew's laugh was simply addicting. Even if the cast did something that wasn't funny at all, if Drew started laughing, it's damn sure that you would, too. Aisha doesn't have this. In fact, in some episodes, it just seems like she's bored (in the first ep of this season, it seemed like 95% of her laughs were completely fake). Drew's demeanor brought a more natural flow to the show, whereas with Aisha, it just feels like one game, cut, next game, cut, etc.  I can't speak for Clive, because I haven't watched the UK one, but Drew absolutely made a huge contribution to the show that Aisha just cannot match. Personally, if I were to stop watching, it would be because of the guests, not the host, but I can't pretend like Aisha is as good of a host as Drew was."
whoselineisitanyway,34mxyw,Freak4Dell,4,Sat May 2 20:13:29 2015 UTC,"I feel if we give it as many seasons as they had with Drew, Aisha could very well pick up her game pretty well."
whoselineisitanyway,34mxyw,mynameisntjeffrey,4,Sun May 3 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the difference between her now and in the first episodes is pretty stark. She's not there yet but she's getting there."

For example, SFAH used to be like 5 scenes, buzzing out the scene after 3 or 4 attempts, now it's like 2 or 3 scenes buzzing out after 7 or 8. And there's always a ""say about your partner"" thing which has always been a fan favorite but gets old. Same thing with props: now there's always a prop that's clearly designed for innuendo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEz46CrXihU like this one.  The guest stars make it harder to watch as well.

What makes it funnier is that Colin seems to have no clue why any one is laughing, probably on purpose because he is a comedic genius.  At least that is what I take from it."

whoselineisitanyway,34kb4s,GobtheCyberPunk,10,Sat May 2 02:20:07 2015 UTC,"In both cases the humor comes from the completely ridiculous non-sequitur, and the degree to which Colin runs with it."
whoselineisitanyway,34kb4s,Acidogenic,7,Sat May 2 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"Arguably, saying ""Arctic Tern"" was the non-sequitur. Ryan agreed and pressed for more information, revealing the tern's call. Also see the ""Mary had a little lamb"" incident."

whoselineisitanyway,34kb4s,falc0nwing,7,Sat May 2 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"My take is that for some reason, Colin's response of Tapiocaaaa, just hit Ryan's funnybone. Haven't you ever heard something that just hit you the right way and it's just waay too funny? And this is being taped in front of an audience over many hours. Ryan is trying to recover, and it's just making it that much more funny.  The moment passed, because Colin mentions tapioca soon after, and barely a grin. Unlike the MEOW joke, which lasted the whole show."
whoselineisitanyway,34kb4s,kamichama,8,Sat May 2 00:12:50 2015 UTC,"There are several people here who are very close to the right answer. If you want to understand what's really going on, you have to know some of the history of this game, and then you have to watch their faces closely, especially Colin's eyes.  So, first of all, in this game, Ryan frequently asks Colin a question, such as ""What would you put on your nacho chips?"" And then Colin replies with a completely unusual answer, like ""little pieces of paper"". So, he usually says something unexpected for a little laugh.  But, if you watch Ryan when Colin says ""tapioca"" the first time, you can see he has to stop himself from smiling. So, for some reason, this word tickled him a little more than the usual response. Furthermore, if you look at Colin, you can see he's watching Ryan at the time.  Now, then, Colin, being the devil that he is, and having seen Ryan stifle a smile, decides to try to make Ryan laugh. This is the part that's confusing because Colin is not trying to make the audience laugh, and you're a part of the audience. If you watch, he never takes his eyes off of Ryan. He basically yells ""TAPIOCA"" in Ryan's face, while making a kind of strange deadpan face.  To make the game work, Ryan has to come up with something to say, and the way conversation works is that you have to anticipate what the other person will say if you want to respond quickly. However, Colin is being completely random. Whatever Ryan thinks Colin might have said, Colin completely obliterated those expectations, causing Ryan to laugh. Then, when Ryan looks back at him, laughing, Colin smiles back showing that he's accomplished his goal. Of course, this is also funny to Ryan, who now cannot stop laughing."

whoselineisitanyway,34l4gs,Burtzman,4,Sat May 2 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"On the two complaints, we're pretty early into the Season. The editor is bound to edit more points giving away into the show. Aisha gives away a load of points during the tapings, nearly after every game; It's just what the editor decides to keep in. Same goes for Credit Readings, Think its a third time the editor put in an all four credit reading. (And they do at least 4-5 each taping!) Same also goes to the audience suggestion and participation games, It's what the editor does (They're choosing out of 18-22 played games; though the editor could make a load of better choices!)"

The pronunciation gag between Aisha and Ryan was great, out of nowhere song styles, and amazing songs. How Linda and Laura make Irish rock sound amazing I'll never know, and the second Greatest Hits song was the funniest song I've ever heard, apart from Brad and Wayne's Beach Boys crack-up."

Gary seemed perfectly capable of playing Questions then all of a sudden they brought on Cedric. Even worse is them bringing the guest on once in each ""Act"" of the show; I'd rather they bring them out in the 2nd act and stay on for a few games in a row instead of going back and forth on & off stage."

whoselineisitanyway,32z9hs,SCFoximus,5,Sat Apr 18 02:56:58 2015 UTC,I get why they bring in special guests when they are obviously new at improv but Cedric could have easily just been a panel member.

whoselineisitanyway,32z9hs,fork_yuu,4,Sat Apr 18 05:06:36 2015 UTC,Props is a bit of a limited game though. Scenes from a hat can be basically every episode as long as they they have interesting questions rather 10 different variations of things you can say to blank but not your girlfriend.
whoselineisitanyway,32z9hs,soggy316,2,Sat Apr 18 18:33:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. and SFAH is played for 20-25+ Minutes each taping

I was in a stage show that she was directing (it was a corporately owned park, so she basically spent like 7 months going from park to park directing this same show).   We were her last park before her contract was up. You could tell she hated the show by then. It was great. She would show up exactly 2 mins late, we'd rehearse for 1 hr solid, 15 min break, 1 hr again. And then she would say something about needing tequila and leave.   She had several stories from the Groundlings and Whose Line, that she didn't often share as that would cut in to Tequila time, but apparently Wayne Brady had hit on her and while she didn't do anything about it, she was really tempted."

I think the reason that he seems so bad is that he breaks the way top 10 lists are supposed to be presented. For example, once the announcer specifically says the thing you're talking about, they usually show the thing right then. Before that, they may show it on-screen, but the announcer only insinuates about it.  Usually, it's like this: <On-screen: #10 Drunk Mother Hoedown> <Long fucking intro about context> ""And it all went to hell during the Drunk Mother Hoedown"" <Show entire hoedown without talking over it>  This guy ruins the expected order: <On-screen: #10 Drunk Mother Hoedown> ""The Drunk Mother Hoedown was really whatever"" <Long fucking intro, audience wondering where the hoedown is> <Show tiny snippets from hoedown, along with other scenes mixed in, talking over everything> <Audience wonders which parts were supposed to be #10>"

Improvers, much like people in any other profession, tend to become more familiar over time.    Think if it like family members or co-wokers, over time you become familiar enough with them that you can make a good educated guess about what they're going to do, and often you'll be right.   With improv that familiarity with a performer can cause you to pretty well know what direction they're going to go with material, and thus you don't have the same surprise that makes you laugh.  It's why the show started with Colin and Ryan, who would be constant, and the other two chairs were supposed to be rotating, adding unfamiliar players who would bring that spark that Colin and Ryan could work off.  But, Wayne just dominated so much that he wound up added as the permanent 3rd, and thus the unfamiliarity factor falls entirely on the 4th chair, and with the latest version, the guest star. Which means the known factors outweigh the unknown factors, making the show and the performers humor, less able to catch you off-guard."

Some of the actors who guest could maybe cope, but certainly the sportspeople and other personalities would just struggle to keep up.  Personally I think they need to drop the celebrity guests and drop one of the regulars per show so they have 2 guest panellists. Oh and for god's sake mix the games up.  Oh and stop having everything boil down to Ryan's John Wayne impression or whatever. The UK version was really careful to keep it as fresh as possible, but the current run is... meh."

And give the guys some breaks! Yeah, the Colin, Ryan, and Wayne work well together, but it ends up becoming a boys club and the rotating seat just becomes the fourth wheel on a tricycle.  I'm sure there are plenty of great comedians that would love a chance at WLIIA.  I also miss some of the old games, as well.

Perhaps even more importantly, the game selection was both a lot better, and a lot more varied in the past. I also think the performers are going for dirtier jokes now (not to say they didn't before, but it's definitely a lot less clean than it used to be), which is an easier target for comedy.  On a semi-related note: I want them to bring back Questionable Impressions. That's by far my favourite game.

whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,Jackker,4,Tue Dec 9 21:18:20 2014 UTC,"Sometimes, I wish she would end a round of SFAH after a scene or two, rather than let the performers act out that same scene forever."
whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Tue Dec 9 01:24:10 2014 UTC,That's my big issue with Aisha. She takes away too much time from SFAH by not using the buzzer enough or getting more scenes in. Right now she's too content with letting the performers (namely Wayne) beating the scene into the ground way too much until it loses whatever humor it had left.
whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,jbgatsby,5,Wed Dec 24 20:18:55 2014 UTC,"Nah, I like it quite like the new version. It took a little while to get its footing but it's still a bunch of funny people doing hilarious improv. And (I might be committing sacrilege) I think that Aisha Tyler is a better host in certain ways than Drew was. Definitely not better in all ways, Drew had is own charm and was better in other ways."

whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,gagsy92,11,Mon Dec 8 08:10:55 2014 UTC,"I agree, but I think some of it may be down to the script writers for the teleprompter. Whenever she does stuff that's not scripted (like talking to Ryan, Colin and Wayne) she's a lot more dialed down. I mean no offence to Americans but I didn't like how stereotypical American the new show is. I still love the comedy and still love watching it, but it just got a bit 'Hey! Welcome to the show! This is great! That's great! Everything's great!'"
whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,nomoredarkness,3,Mon Dec 8 12:48:20 2014 UTC,"Regarding that last part, the Drew Carey-led incarnation was the same way. There are plenty of ""bloopers"" to be found where bits had to be redone (especially the intro of the show) because they weren't done in as loud/hammy a way as the producers wanted them to be."
whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,Digging_For_Ostrich,2,Tue Dec 9 21:21:46 2014 UTC,"Spot on. For me she was the wrong choice of host, she has no real sense of humour and seems almost in awe of the comedians, laughing way too hard at any tiny joke.  Drew was good, but Clive absolutely hit the exact sweet spot of funny vs hosting."
whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,gagsy92,5,Mon Dec 8 15:59:16 2014 UTC,"She's basically like an excited kid. I appreciate the energy she brings but I think she just needs a touch of seriousness in her hosting. Drew and Clive had that seriousness and would always throw in bits of banter here and there which made them good. I'm not saying I dislike Aisha, but she seems like more of a fan of the show than a host of it.  Side note: I miss the sideways scene game, that was always so entertaining to watch! Even if there was little talking in it."

I think she's kind of still a ""work in progress"" in the role, and that actually doing some of the skits will help her to improve, and to know when and where to make herself part of the show, rather than just sitting off to the side, or randomly appearing in the background."
whoselineisitanyway,2olnyw,GratefullyGodless,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:24:13 2014 UTC,"I think she's a better host then Drew in all ways. She's smart, funny, and gorgeous. She started out rocky, but has really settled into the host chair wonderfully.  I always thought Drew was the weakest part of the last series. He insisted on joining the improv when he just wasn't on par with the others, which made a lot of stuff land with more of a thud than a laugh."

I don't think it would be hard not to snap when all you hear your whole life is random people yelling out a catchphrase you're known for or a scene you did. The Sopranos focused a lot on depression. Tony Soprano said ""I find I have to be the sad clown. Laughing on the outside, crying on the inside."" I think a lot of celebrities feel that way and we are the cause of that. I don't remember who said it in an AMA but someone asked them what they should do when they see them in public.

whoselineisitanyway,2iqkv4,nxtm4n,7,Thu Oct 9 08:04:24 2014 UTC,"I've tried. It's rare that I find British humor funny. There are some exceptions, though. The office, outnumbered, anything with Ricky Gervais. I just cannot stand any British comedy that has a live studio audience. They laugh at the most mundane jokes. You'd swear every line was the funniest thing they've ever heard. Some American shows are like that as well. I feel the same way about most US sitcoms. The Big Bang Theory is the worst offender. I hear the dialogue and when I hear how hard the audience laughs at these terrible jokes...it completely takes me out of the moment. Because I can't help but notice they are laughing at terrible jokes. I also don't like British panel comedy. I think Americans try to convince themselves that dry British humor is witty and it makes them feel smart for getting the jokes. But just because they have an accent, that doesn't automatically make it clever. I feel like some people feel a bit elitist for enjoying British humor. Kind of like how you can buy a cup of coffee at a gas station for a dollar or you can spend 5 bucks on coffee at Starbucks for no other reason than because it's Starbucks. This is why I've only been watching the final season of the British Whose Line so far."

whoselineisitanyway,2iqkv4,nxtm4n,2,Thu Oct 9 21:57:14 2014 UTC,it could be that that is not the audience laughing but recorded laughter because the writers think the tv audience is too dumb to know when to laugh or get a joke

Isn't it just as elitist to judge people for the way they react to certain kinds of comedy even though you don't actually know what they really think and feel, all the while saying that you don't enjoy it?  It's like saying a band sucks because of their fans."

And because I don't believe it's as witty as other people think. I think people mistake the accent for cleverness. But it's not really ""smart"" comedy."

Between that day and October 16, rescuers worked for 58 hours to free her from the eight-inch (20 cm) well casing 22 feet (6.7 m) below the ground. The story gained worldwide attention (leading to some criticism as a media circus), and later became the subject of a 1989 television movie Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure on ABC. As presented in it, a vital part of the rescue was the use of the then relatively new technology of waterjet cutting.

Robin Williams played 5 Games and got 1000 points so in this graph he's got aproximatly 200 points per game. Also, only the points are count in, not the amount of winnings. It's simply (Number of points at all)/(Number of games participated)  That is the point that's makes it most accurrate: If you only count the points it's normal that the ones with the most participations (Ryan) will win.

whoselineisitanyway,2ebl4m,Taedirk,36,Fri Aug 22 23:07:31 2014 UTC,"It's a reference to one of Shakespeare's early plays, ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"".  The joke is that Wayne is playing it literally (hillbillies doing Shakespeare instead of Shakespeare influenced by hillbillies), receives no response (uncultured hillbillies), and responds with ""read a book, people!""  Also, it's revenuers, not reverends.  In other words, tax men."
whoselineisitanyway,2ebl4m,Zaliron,16,Fri Aug 22 23:42:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, essentially the audience wasn't responding well to many of the literary references, so Wayne called them out on it."

whoselineisitanyway,2e57c9,rjchau,3,Fri Aug 22 05:37:34 2014 UTC,Drew and Aisha were just on The Price is Right together!
whoselineisitanyway,2e57c9,nomoredarkness,2,Thu Aug 21 12:20:21 2014 UTC,"She's gotten far, far more comfortable with the improvisers and the concept behind the show, I think. The fact that they're not being constrained to basically G-rated humor is a breath of fresh air as well.  And there's more audience participation...and a greater variety of games. I've been loving what I've caught on YouTube lately. :D"
whoselineisitanyway,2e4zhb,420amazeit,7,Thu Aug 21 01:21:57 2014 UTC,"I tried to use Mark's Guide To ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"", to narrow down when it started, and the earliest (and least exaggerated) John Wayne impression I was able to find was in Series 5 (s05e04) of the original show. It got some big laughs then, and the next time John Wayne is mentioned on that site, is four years later in Series 9 (s09e08), during a game of Superheroes, where Greg announced him as ""Bad John Wayne Impression Boy"".   By the time the US version aired, I guess it had become well enough known by everyone involved at how bad it was, and how well it was received, that it just continued to get bigger and more exaggerated the more it was requested."
whoselineisitanyway,2e4zhb,SCFoximus,5,Thu Aug 21 04:33:02 2014 UTC,"I have seen quite a few John Wayne movies, and it's actually not as bad as it seems at first glance. Ryan's impression seems to be based on a select few moments from movies where John Wayne did get exactly like that. Sure, he overdoes it a bit, but it's comedy after all. If I were you I would look into getting some John Wayne movies. TMC runs marathons of them quite often. Specifically, look for ""El Dorado"", ""War Wagon"", ""The Sons of Katie Elder"", or basically any movie where he's playing a cowboy character and you'll see what I'm talking about."

I don't think I've laughed as much at an episode of Whose Line since Richard Simmons.
