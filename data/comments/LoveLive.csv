LoveLive,3e3y2j,Asphyria,7,Tue Jul 21 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"By end, I think they mean the end of their story.  Which isn't a bad thing.  All stories need an end; that's life.  I don't think this means the end of the franchise/project.  They might slow down a little (which I think is good), but I'm still expecting songs and maybe a few more lives.  At least one more live.  Whenever they release a song, it gets into top 10 at least.  It'd be stupid to just stop.  And there's still a lot of figures, products, and other merchandise they'll come up with.  I'm still waiting for the rest of the Birthday series figures, and we just got Umi's preview of the 2nd Nendoroid set.  Not to mention whatever was teased in the latest(?) Dengeki G's, that thing we thought was a VN tease.  And the huge upcoming update to SIF that Bushiroad previewed a little while ago."

Being a seiyuu must be a heck of an experience- basically living the lives of fictional characters and bringing them to life for everyone to see.  I was so sad when in the anime μ’s were going to break up, so I can't even fathom how much it meant to the seiyuu."

I'm curious about the order though. I was expecting Eli next so this is a curveball. Perhaps they're doing it by year group? So I'd expect Kotori next.

LoveLive,3dxeso,spacetechnology,3,Mon Jul 20 09:27:32 2015 UTC,That wig is a bit too brown compared to hanayo's hair.  I'd suggest focus on knowing how to style a wig to make it look more fitting to the character and giving it a general better look.  Wearing the wig like this alone won't look too great if nothing has been done to the wig.

If you want something more of a light brown (though her hair is green/brown) I might suggest http://www.wig-supplier.com/30cm-short-gold-straight-love-live-hanayo-koizumi-cosplay-wig-p-3039.html though I can't personally speak for their quality because I haven't bought from them yet, I just hear great things.

""Beat the Ente"" for me everytime... poor duck.  Then there is No Brand Girls, definitly one of my favorite songs. However, I always end up understand only ""No Bra"" instead of ""No Brand"" /.- Also the ""Jibun kara motto chikara wo dashite yo"" line? The ""kara motto"" sounds like ""lahme Otto"" which would translate into ""slow otto"" or something orz  Then, in Dancing Stars on Me, there is this line where they sing ""Shining Milky Way!"" In this case its not a misheard lyric, but I always end up thinking about the Milky Way chocolate Dx  I think those aren't the only misheard lyrics, but the only ones I can think of right now x.x"

LoveLive,3dtfec,Ahoahoaho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:54 2015 UTC,"Aside from the Mogyutto and A-RISE songs...  In Music S.T.A.R.T, I often hear the 'ii zo party' (in the second chorus) as 'Pizza party'...   Pretty sure that many are familiar with the Natsu-iro 'Submarine's.  Occasionally, I hear the 'Nico nico stage' in Trouble busters as 'Nico nico soup-take it!'.  And sometimes, I hear the 'Love wing' in Love wing bell as 'Love di-' I'll just stop there."

LoveLive,3drzvd,Arkonite,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:28 2015 UTC,What do you mean by 'theme'? What sort of thing do you need a theme for?
LoveLive,3drzvd,UltimateEpicFailz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:50 2015 UTC,I mean it like a theme for android launchers.
