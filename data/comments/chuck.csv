chuck,3e0edk,xXSkrublordXx,2,Tue Jul 21 04:54:35 2015 UTC,I think OP is talking about on screen passion.
chuck,3e0edk,Pearfeet,2,Tue Jul 21 09:31:02 2015 UTC,"Well for a lot of it, the relationship was fake and Chuck was Chuck...."
chuck,3e0edk,zimm3r16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's kind of more appropriate and true-to-life that way. Most people don't continue kissing like desperate teenagers after the initial few weeks of a relationship have passed. Also, with all the other girlfriends Chuck had, it was when he was in love with Sarah but ""knew"" he could never have her, so the fact that he was getting with another girl was extra satisfying on multiple levels for him. Sometimes it was kind of like a forbidden thing since he's supposed to be fake-dating Sarah, which makes it psychologically more appealing, to do something he's not supposed to. Also, since he loved Sarah but couldn't have her, being with any other girl was like trying to satisfy an immense hunger or thirst but never quite being able to.  That is just my opinion."
chuck,3e1e5x,lathan98,6,Tue Jul 21 05:22:17 2015 UTC,"When Casey gives Chuck advice about how you don't need a perfect moment to propose, you just need the girl. True Casey moment right there. Casey rarely gives advice, but when he does. He is so wise."

chuck,3d81hu,Kopwnicus,3,Tue Jul 14 23:16:09 2015 UTC,They left it open to interpretation. I like to think so too.
chuck,3d81hu,Antrikshy,3,Wed Jul 15 03:24:02 2015 UTC,I think season 5 is worth it. It definitely redeems itself with the final orchestra scene and the parallels it pulls there

chuck,3d81hu,amanzarak,5,Tue Jul 14 12:32:47 2015 UTC,"I've tried rewatching it but often find it difficult knowing how the series ends.    Even with the somewhat awkward nature of the first half of Season 5, I do enjoy some of those episodes.  I think that they would have been much better off had they either ended things after Season 4 or after ""vs. the Santa Suit"" in Season 5, which could have been reworked fairly easily into a series finale."
chuck,3d81hu,4CES,2,Tue Jul 14 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way my first rewatch, I found it hard to keep going knowing how it ends. I was reluctant to go down that road. I actually stopped during season 4 during Vivian part lost interest. During my 2nd rewatch I noticed that Chuck said to Sarah ""we have to be the best spies ever"" after the decker indecent. I took that to heart. Even if Sarah doesn't get her memories back, Chuck is the best spy in the world. Now with the intersect I believe that chuck and Sarah will travel the world being a better spy team than Sarah was with Bryce Larkin Give it another chance and just watch it for how bad ass of a spy that Chuck is. Season 5 ep1 when he runs down the hall to jump out of building and land on a moving car! Same season the ""hack-off"" see how Chuck could out hack anyone it was really amazing!!! Long Live Chuck!!!"
chuck,3d81hu,Kopwnicus,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:25 2015 UTC,"I just don't have the urge to watch any episodes of Chuck anymore, and I can't decide if it's my dislike/borderline hatred of season 5 or the fact I've watched seasons 1&2 at least 10 times that's the main reason.  I tried re-watching season 5 a 2nd time and I only made it to vs the Santa Suit.  Like you mentioned it's probably the best episode of the season."
chuck,3d81hu,omg_what_the_chuck,4,Wed Jul 15 00:05:11 2015 UTC,"""Santa Suit"" is definitely the best episode of S5, but I've got to admit that I also quite like ""Bullet Train"" as well.    I think the overall arc of S5 could have fared very well had they gotten a full 22 episodes to work with.  S5 really bucked the trend of the series, where they usually had too thin of a story to be stretched out over 22+ episodes (usually because they had to tell their story initially over 13 episodes with additional eps ordered later on by NBC).    With S5, I think their story would have benefited from being longer than 13 episodes, so they could have further entrenched Decker and Quinn as villains while also giving more time for Shaw to be shown maneuvering behind the scenes.  As it is, though, things move far too rapidly for the story to have much impact (the whole virus thing is over far too quickly).  That could have also allowed the whole ""Chuck vs. Sarah"" thing to play out short of the finale and still give them time to wrap things up in a more satisfying fashion rather than virtually destroying the entire series for the sake of the ending they wanted."
chuck,3d81hu,4CES,4,Wed Jul 15 00:49:25 2015 UTC,"And in the spirit of this post, I shall re-embark upon Chuck's journey for the countless time after a hard upcoming two weeks!   Gotta be honest, didn't expect to find motivation here just now, but I did anyway. So thanks for that."

chuck,3coew5,toastertim,21,Sun Jul 12 10:27:49 2015 UTC,This is a common theory on this board :P  But you don't need to STFU
chuck,3coew5,Charles_Phoenix,12,Thu Jul 9 14:40:03 2015 UTC,Very common but one of my favorite theories... it makes sense when you hear what he says at the beginning of the episodes before the recap.. after watching through the entire series it makes sense... whether or not the writers intended it to be like that to tie in so well or not... it's still genius! Makes rewatching easier and makes the ending easier to accept

chuck,3coew5,sensrawsm,4,Sat Jul 18 11:06:03 2015 UTC,"I like to think of it as not one long story but with chuck and sarah being together afterwards because sarah trusts chuck, and each episode is one singular story that chuck is telling sarah each time. this makes  opening of "" here are some things you need know or maybe just forgot"" a lot easier to tie in."

chuck,3cnbf5,Rationalspace787,4,Thu Jul 9 06:09:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of people feel disappointed by the last season.  I agree that the first parts were lame after rewatching it, however I came to like the ending! Sometimes it takes a rewatch for it to happen though.  You may want to watch this podcast: http://blip.tv/chuckpodcast/105-chris-fedak-answers-6000277. It was done a little after the last episode, and it provides a bit of closure as Chris Fedak (one of the creators) explains the ending. Honestly, listening to the podcast caused me to appreciate the writers' decision to make it end the way it did more."
chuck,3cnbf5,Charles_Phoenix,5,Thu Jul 9 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree for the most part. I think you're (largely) right about the undoing of Sarah's character development, but everyone else's is extremely prevalent. To me, the show is about Chuck's journey and when you look at where he started (a loser with no self-esteem or plans for the future) and then look at where he ended up (a hero who sacrificed the only thing he wanted to save hundreds of people from certain death) the character development is obvious and touching. In the very final scene, season one Chuck would have gone home and felt sorry for himself. He would have started eating cheese balls and let himself go like the beginning of season three. Season five Chuck owned his choice and didn't feel sorry for himself. He didn't give up either.  Also, while Sarah may not have gotten her memories back, season one Sarah would never have told Chuck to kiss her the way she did in season five. To me, that showed that the character wanted to remember. She wanted what she lost with Chuck. She was going to take a chance on him. She was going to trust him. That's not something season one Sarah was even capable of doing.  Not to mention the character development of all the other characters like Morgan (from a codependent, immature clown to a responsible man in a serious relationship) and Casey (a lethal loner with no real friends to a lethal father with several friends). Even Jeff and Lester display a degree of development often overlooked with minor characters.  In the end, I can see why you would feel let down by the finale. Personally, I felt the same the first time I watched it, but I find it beautiful now. I just love the characters so much and I'm still holding out hope for a Chuck movie...a pipe dream though that may be. And who knows, maybe Stockholm Syndrome is the only reason I like, but I don't think that's the case. Anyway, I've rambled long enough. This is my two cents. Take it for what it's worth."
chuck,3cnbf5,419pennies,6,Thu Jul 9 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Don't worry this is the general trend with finishing Chuck. You'll find the ending to be horrible right after watching it and then in a couple years later you'll realize you actually liked the ending and will be commenting on someone else's rant on reddit about how they hated the ending, telling them this exact same message. Alas it is the cycle of Chuck viewing :)"
chuck,3cnbf5,chucksimpson,3,Thu Jul 9 15:07:25 2015 UTC,"I kinda have to agree with you. The dynamic of the show felt like it changed near the last couple of episodes and there was a lot of room for improvement. But I think based on how many shows were going to air and time constraints it led to that type of end to the show. I just finished Chuck vs The Goodbye literally 5 minutes ago and I felt like there were times where it could have gone better and feel more like the show's ""regular"" state.  Spoiler"
chuck,3cnbf5,generalhawx,3,Thu Jul 9 07:38:29 2015 UTC,"I just finished the show today. I have no idea how they managed to make me hate Quinn so much when he was only in half a season. Seriously, I hate that guy."
chuck,3cnbf5,dan_144,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:21:47 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with that you will come to terms with the ending after awhile. My problem with Season 5 was the lack of the big bad through out the season. I thought Shaw could have been a bigger bad, pulling the strings from his jail cell the entire season. Or introduce Quinn earlier in the season. He felt like his character was rushed and I didn't hate him the way I hated Fulcrum or the Ring, he was just there at the end.    I just finished a rewatch myself. I feel like they could have done more at the final episode though. The picture that Chuck drew during Chuck vs the Bullet Train, I don't remember him using it during Chuck vs Sarah or Chuck vs the Goodbye(Although I could have missed it). She says during that she could never forget that and I really thought that could have been a strong pull for Sarah to regain her memories towards the end. I do agree that the end of Season 4 was great and I got a little weepy during it."

chuck,3bhl3m,Locknlawl,16,Mon Jun 29 07:45:23 2015 UTC,I think Psych would also be a good pick.  It's got that same quirky charm that made Chuck awesome.
chuck,3bhl3m,LunerEklipse1,2,Mon Jun 29 14:59:23 2015 UTC,Just started that a few weeks ago just for that reason. I love it! Now one of my favorites but still not better than Chuck!
chuck,3bhl3m,Emerald-Guardian,4,Tue Jun 30 14:52:20 2015 UTC,"Was actually thinking about watching that show a while ago, is it about the same as Chuck?   The reason I loved Chuck so much was the light-heartedness of it all, it managed a perfect balance between drama and comedy that I haven't been able to come across in any other show yet."
chuck,3bhl3m,Mojosaur,8,Mon Jun 29 10:24:13 2015 UTC,"Burn notice is very good, but it's not in the same league as Chuck.  It's more like if you take the serious parts of Chuck, and make it all about that.  No Buy More, 80% less humor (there is still SOME humor).  Lots of explosions."
chuck,3bhl3m,amanzarak,2,Mon Jun 29 13:17:56 2015 UTC,"The connection between the two are ""spy"" based. They are both ""spy"" tv shows. Different in almost every other way."

chuck,3bhl3m,DlSCOSTU,3,Sun Jul 5 05:56:52 2015 UTC,We tried both Burn Notice and Pysch. Didn't make it far with either. The closest fun drama that I can think of is White Collar. Not too heavy but carrys some emotion.
chuck,3bhl3m,FriedChicken24,2,Tue Jun 30 22:45:21 2015 UTC,White collar is awesome and I absolutely love psych but I agree that the first season of Burn notice is kinda meh but It does get a lot better and some of the later seasons are amazing.
chuck,3bhl3m,angry_pooper,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:25:31 2015 UTC,Interesting. Maybe we will give it another try. I felt like both seemed pretty dated and they just didn't hook us like Chuck did.
chuck,3bhl3m,sensrawsm,2,Wed Jul 1 21:29:49 2015 UTC,Yeah burn notice although great is pretty repetitive so if you didnt like the first season you probably wont enjoy the rest of the show as well but I would definitely give Psych another shot the last season was kind of a let down minus the finale but everything else is great and I feel the character development of all the main characters is pretty much on point with chuck's

chuck,3ba8kn,mrshankledorfer,5,Sat Jun 27 07:07:07 2015 UTC,I like ops interpretation. Makes sense. Op are familiar with the things you might not remember theory? I like that theory too in conjunction with this interpretation.
chuck,3ba8kn,DantheManFoley,3,Sat Jun 27 10:16:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP's interpretation of the meaning of the kiss, but it doesn't mean she won't get her memories back at some point. There are several hints throughout the final episode that she might already be getting her memories back slowly. I don't think the kiss will suddenly give back all her memories, but it might trigger A memory or a feeling to return, just like playing some significant songs might (eg the one at the end of S03E14). It is often said (on tv/in movies) that certain actions/surroundings can trigger a memory (again, not all) to return, I don't know how true this is but it seems plausible to me."
chuck,3ba8kn,TheCainer,3,Sat Jun 27 12:33:58 2015 UTC,"I partially agree. I made this observation in another post, however, if you go back and watch there is a history within the show of bringing back destroyed memories with a kiss.   Additionally, since this is the same version of the intersect that Morgan had you can draw some parallels. Remember how Morgan did not remember having his pants pulled down at first but then after some coaxing he did? I think this works the same way. Morgan did not get back his geeky movie trivia but he did get back some of the more important memories. Sarah, will remember Chuck. Not necessarily will she remember everything but I think she remembers the big things: Meeting him, their first kiss, the proposal, the wedding.   Also, re-watching the last episode... Morgan is essentially on his A-Game. Everything he says is either awesome advice that works or he's just plain right. I think that the last episode, if you really look, alludes to the fact that Morgan is pretty much on point for that episode and I think that gives the one magical kiss theory some merit."
chuck,3ba8kn,JohnSquiggleton,3,Sat Jun 27 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"You have made some very good points on this. And this is all before we get to the fact that Sarah started to slowly remember the past 5 years in the last episode, which takes place 2 weeks after the one before it. It is almost as if the more she falls for Chuck, the more she remembers. True Chuck fans who pay attention to detail, like myself, would know that it's obvious that the Chuck-Sarah relationship isn't over."
chuck,3ba8kn,theseth9,3,Sun Jun 28 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"I want to believe she got her memories back.  There was a thread a few weeks back where the OP points out Morgan's advice in that final episode is never wrong.  So by that logic, Sarah's memories would've been restored with the kiss."
chuck,3ba8kn,LunerEklipse1,2,Sat Jun 27 18:51:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think Morgan was EVER wrong about them.  Been rewatching lately, and he even told Ellie one time ""Chuck and Sarah are about to walk through that door right now"" and they did lol."
chuck,3ba8kn,amanzarak,2,Mon Jun 29 13:20:16 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, those memories she lost were useless anyways.  Their relationship was built on spying, all the memories they have are spy related they never really got to do anything romantic besides a wedding and stuff. Chuck even foreshadowed this whole event because he knew they wouldn't work out because the spy thing.  Now spying is out of the equation, just Sarah and Chuck and now they can make real memories."
chuck,3ba8kn,Nalyss,2,Sat Jun 27 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the whole point of the 5 series was the story of them falling in love. For me, it makes rewatching all the more worth it, because you know they will just fall in love over and over again."
chuck,3ba8kn,Screwy26,2,Sun Jun 28 01:25:39 2015 UTC,"Of course she'll fall in love with chuck again, everyone knows this. The issue was that 5 years of character development and memories went down the drain."
chuck,3ba8kn,Topshot27,2,Sun Jun 28 08:11:00 2015 UTC,"I agree. I just rewatched all the seasons again and even though the finale always gets me, I still have a sense of longing. I know that Chuck and Sarah are/will be together and that Sarah will remember everything, but what about the past 5 years they've been through as a couple? Seeing the two characters fall for each other in the first season gives me a feeling like no other."

chuck,3b0ts4,30percentAlpaca,2,Thu Jun 25 03:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. I think they gave all the foreshadowing possible to let you know they do. What they leave up to you is the magic of it. If the magic works, they're fine. If it doesn't, they're still on the way to being fine. Whether or not she remembers, Sarah has opened the door to allowing herself to be happy, something Sarah from S1E1 and right after the memory loss wasn't capable. If anything, she's set up to fall harder and faster for Chuck considering how quickly he turned her around.   edit: Also, to bring it all back, most of this groundwork is laid out over the course of the series. It's the main draw I see in every re-watch."
chuck,3b0ts4,QuantumFury,2,Thu Jun 25 03:27:04 2015 UTC,"Chuck and Sarah are still my favourite love story. I'm rewatching it now and even though I know what's going to happen, it's still great to watch. If you only watch the ending, you'd think (spoilers, obviously) ""Oh, they fell in love, and then she forgot"". But you don't know all they've been through to get there! How much they've fought for each other and to be together. That's where the real magic is. It does make it a little sad to see them and know that Sarah is going to lose all of these memories and experiences, but it also makes it all the more magical (yes, it's all magic) to see her accept her relationship with Chuck as true and real and ask him to kiss her at the end. Plus everyone in this sub is convinced that Sarah will recover her memories and fall in love with Chuck again (though not necessarily in that order).    Seasons 2 and 3 are the best, although I hate Shaw (whom you'll meet soon enough). Season 4 is not as good, but still entertaining. Season 5 is easily the worst of all of them, but if you've gone that far, you might as well stay for the ride and say goodbye to our friends. There are some redeeming qualities in Season 5, I'd say mainly the humour factor. Season 5 is when their budget was majorly slashed and sometimes you just have to laugh at the sets and props, and they make a hilarious deal of Subway's sponsorship of the show."

chuck,3auxqa,DavidSanders1,7,Tue Jun 23 18:35:58 2015 UTC,"I would say they live in the dream house together and stopped spying, Casey also stopped spying and everyone is living happily ever after but Beckman gets endangered and Shaw finally gets control of the CIA so the team reunites to bring him down."

chuck,3auxqa,the_boomr,3,Tue Jun 23 23:09:18 2015 UTC,"While I like the general arc of your ideas, I really don't like the driving force being Sarah leaving...AGAIN. After the rollercoaster of the first 5 seasons and their finale, I don't think it's ok to throw Sarah and Chuck into the uncertainty zone again."
chuck,3auxqa,the_boomr,2,Fri Jun 26 07:41:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can certainly understand that sentiment.  I think pretty much everyone who watched the show wanted to see Chuck and Sarah get their happily ever after, and my idea seems to move them further away from that.  A few thoughts, though.  Throughout the series, it becomes clear that Sarah doesn't like the person she became while working for the CIA.  This is most apparent in season three, where she helplessly watches Chuck potentially go through a similar transition, but her unwillingness to share her past in season four as well.  She resided herself to doing morally reprehensible things because the CIA provided her with the only source of stability in her life, and a part of her hated it.  It was only through her time working (and falling in love) with Chuck that she was able to embrace her lighter side.  Yet, even as their relationship blossomed, Sarah feared her love might think less of her if he dug too deep into her past (this even held true with the first appearance of her father).  What I'm trying to say is, it took a lot for Sarah to get to the point where she could feel comfortable letting down her guard at all around Chuck.  She never did so completely.  So, what would she do if her feelings for Chuck (which I believe transcend memory) remained the same, but all of that time, that development as a person, was suddenly washed away?  She wouldn't be able to see herself as the woman with which Chuck fell in love.  All her fears of him looking at her in a different light would be overwhelming.  Sarah would most likely wish to avoid that, sparing Chuck the reality of who she really is, and preserving the memories of who she was in his mind.  While this seems bleak, the payoff could be huge, if the storyline were to be handled properly.  If Chuck were to see Sarah commit an act she was ashamed of in order to preserve her cover, yet still accept her, all of those trust issues dissolve, and the audience (i.e. us) finally get to see the true Sarah Walker.  By late into the season, not only would Chuck and Sarah be back together, but their relationship would reach a point it could never have achieved if she had simply regained her memory at the conclusion of season five.  And that uncertainty we all would have felt a the beginning of the season could only make the whole thing that much sweeter in the end."
chuck,3auxqa,ktbsupremo,2,Sat Jun 27 06:06:20 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, and I love how much thought you've put into it. I would be ok with something like this happening maybe, but only if it didn't last the whole season, I think it would pain me too much if this became the main plot point of the season. And I would prefer it to not be happening immediately, so only after a couple episodes have passed does Sarah actually leave and do these things. And several episodes later we see them get back together to take on the big baddie as a team.  But hey, if the writers give us anything I will gobble it up like the wolf gobbled grandma lol, no matter what content it has."
chuck,3auxqa,Nalyss,2,Sat Jun 27 06:49:30 2015 UTC,"I really like that idea, it's got the whole dilemma/problematic story ark. I also believe that it should start how the first series started as in the love department and make it the beginning of the cycle again."
chuck,3auxqa,Knifferoo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"Love would be a major theme throughout the season in my idea.  First, there is the fear on Sarah's part that Chuck won't love her, as the years of him softening her personality have been erased.  In her mind, she can't comprehend someone like Chuck loving someone as ""morally flexible"" as her.  Which is why she would leave in the first place; in order to preserve the memories he has of her.  For his part, Chuck, who is always lacking in self-confidence, would feel as though he couldn't win over Sarah again.  That it was luck that allowed Sarah to get to know him and fall in love, and now that all of that has been removed from her brain, there's no chance he will be able to win her back (which is why he needs Casey to set him straight, in the least sensitive manner possible)."

chuck,3auxqa,SwordOfCheese,2,Tue Jun 23 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, this seems like a really solid idea. The only real problem I see would be conveying Sarah's thought process behind leaving Chuck, but that shouldn't be too big of a problem."
chuck,3auxqa,4CES,2,Tue Jun 23 20:41:44 2015 UTC,"My thought on that would be that Sarah would initially appear as though the feeling of love is gone, though she'd let him down gently.  Then, in a few instances when she's alone, she would show signs (like staring at a picture of Chuck with a forlorn look upon her face, for example) that said feelings are still there.  Over time, her motivations for lying would be revealed, most likely when Chuck witnesses her doing something unscrupulous as part of her self-established cover."

chuck,3ajfi5,Chuckles100,15,Sat Jun 20 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"When I first thought about it I wanted it to be around the Vs Santa Claus episode (2x11) mainly because I loved Chuck/Sarah in that episode, then I started looking for signs that it was around that time and I'm as certain as I can be that it is.   First off, in the recording she says ""things are quiet, nothing really to report"" at the start of vs the Santa Claus chuck says to Sarah ""things sure are quiet around here, bad guys taking a holiday too or something?"" (may not be word for word), you could argue that he meant that very moment in time but I doubt it, it seems like they have just come off a small down time in bad guyary.  Second, its a very minor point but still worth mentioning, in the recording she was in the orange orange outfit, she spent the entire episode of 2x11 in that outfit. Yes, she was in and out of it all through season 2 and the first half of season 3 but still, slightly relevant.  The overall timing feels right, its the epsiode after they had dealt with her dad and Chuck really helped Sarah through that, she wouldn't have had such an easy time if it wern't for him. Also in 2x11 if you pay close attention you can see a change in Sarah toward Chuck, almost like she has fully dedicated herself to him and will do whatever it takes to secure her future with him, which leads straight to the Mauser incident.   I could probably find more points to raise but I'm dead certain that I'm right here, it felt right before I searched for clues and everything fit when I did, I still love the fact thats its open to interpretation though and can be discussed, there's certainly no 100% right answer so give me any other ideas you guys have or just reasons you think I'm wrong!"

chuck,3ajfi5,Why_So_Serious_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:42:12 2015 UTC,I like to think that the bracelet he gave her as a Christmas present could have really help with her thoughts toward the matter.
chuck,3ajfi5,Nalyss,0,Sun Jun 21 05:00:55 2015 UTC,"This answer is obviously correct, she gets the real girlfriend gift and committed murder to stay with him.  That and she wouldn't be wearing her work outfit at the end of the day if she wasn't stuck wearing it all day, she usually has a normal outfit on when recording it unless it's recorded late at night like the bomb outfit one and since she killed him in that outfit she probably would of went home and recorded the log right away - before she shoots him she lowers her gun showing she was thinking about it and it's that thought that led her to realize she loves chuck and needs him around."
chuck,3ajfi5,brickbeard77,9,Mon Jun 22 02:57:03 2015 UTC,"I posted this a long time ago when this was asked before. I think it is probably a little earlier than this guess suggests, but I think its probably somewhat accurate:  By looking at the numbered days that we have from the first season and matching them with the episodes that they likely correspond to we get the following information:  Day 1 = Episode 1, Chuck vs. the Intersect   Day 21 = Episode 4, Chuck vs. the Wookie   Day 49 = Episode 8, Chuck vs. the Truth   Day 56 = Episode 9, Chuck vs. the Hard Salami  What we can see here is that it seems that, at least in the first season we have 1 episode for every week.   This allows us to assume that Halloween, which occurs in episode 6- Chuck vs. the Sandworm, would include day 35 in Sarah's log. This further means that Halloween in the second season would be somewhere near day 400 of Sarah's log.   Now, there is no Halloween episode in season 2. However we know that Valentines day is 107 days after Halloween. This means that day 507 takes place during the episode 13 of season two, Chuck vs. the Suburbs.  Now if the week per episode thing that can be seen in the first season is correct then that would land day 564 during the season finale, Chuck vs. the Ring. Now there is an argument to be made here that this would make sense. Sarah after all chooses to remain in Burbank instead of going with Bryce in this episode, an act that definitely implied that she loved Chuck.  So what should we take away from this comment: A) I have waaaayyyyyy too much time on my hands. B) Day 564 is definitely near the end of the second season and possibly at the very end of the season."
chuck,3ajfi5,DlSCOSTU,4,Sun Jun 21 00:31:43 2015 UTC,Dang that is some analysis. Nice work!
chuck,3ajfi5,wotsenter,3,Sun Jun 21 00:55:27 2015 UTC,Nailed it.
chuck,3ajfi5,fretspyder,4,Wed Jun 24 03:00:27 2015 UTC,"That's my belief as well - right before Beefcake, or right after Lethal Weapon -  though I'd be very curious what a widespread poll would say. Beefcake/Lethal Weapon works so well because she is presented with a perfectly viable interest, but still wants Chuck. She can't deny it, is called on it, and must admit it to herself at that point."
chuck,3ajfi5,bothways1,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:44:31 2015 UTC,that was my thought as well when I posted this same question last year. Right around Beefcake seems correct.
chuck,3ak8sv,DlSCOSTU,5,Sun Jun 21 00:42:34 2015 UTC,I just wanted the kiss to be earlier in the episode and see Sarah's eyes light up as she remembers everything.
chuck,3ak8sv,jeremymg,3,Tue Jun 23 04:35:45 2015 UTC,I thought she'd go to her hotel and find the drawing of Chuck and her at the dream house and remember everything
chuck,3ak8sv,Nalyss,2,Sun Jun 21 19:52:40 2015 UTC,I wanted the episode to last just a few more seconds so we could see Sarah flash and hopefully get her memories back. I guess this way is better if they ever want to make another season or a movie. WE CAN HOPE!
chuck,3ahefj,DavidSanders1,33,Sat Jun 20 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"The only reason to revive Chuck would bebif they have a really good idea for a story arc. Until Zach and the others say ""we've got something we want to do"", I don't think trying to force Chuck back on the air is helping anything."
chuck,3ahefj,longshot2025,5,Sat Jun 20 07:40:48 2015 UTC,"I mean they want to make a movie, why not just expand the movie and make an arc out of it?"
chuck,3ahefj,Animal31,2,Sat Jun 20 08:30:02 2015 UTC,"If that meant we ended up with a lot of filler, I'd prefer the movie."
chuck,3ahefj,longshot2025,3,Sat Jun 20 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way, though I'm not sure they'd know how to write filler material, given how tight they had to write each season due to the constant threat of cancellation.  There were actually several instances where I wish the writers would have had to luxury to take their time with certain story arcs, and the stability of Netflix would likely give them exactly that."
chuck,3ahefj,fretspyder,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on the definition of filler. Chuck was always a fun show because they could make episodic plots that were just good plain fun. Not everything had to tie into some grand arc. Of course, I'll take a 5 minute short if that's what they'll give me."
chuck,3ahefj,longshot2025,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:07:28 2015 UTC,I probably shouldn't have said filler. I definitely don't mind those fun episodes. What I don't like is when they stretch out the arc to last the whole season.
chuck,3ahefj,fretspyder,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"Totally, arcs that run too long are worse than one-offs"
chuck,3ahefj,TheReddition,3,Sun Jun 21 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with what you're saying, which is why I posted the petition.  It seemed to me the goal was to try and get a conversation going between the creators of the show and Netflix, in order to see if there were ideas that could justify bringing Chuck back, as opposed to petitioning NBC to just force it back on the air, which wouldn't work anyway."
chuck,3ahefj,TheDefenestratedOne,6,Sat Jun 20 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE for Chuck to come back, but I just don't think it could ever be as good. I would hate for it to make a comeback, and it change my view on the whole series."
chuck,3ahefj,WineVirus,2,Sat Jun 20 13:21:15 2015 UTC,"I get that entirely.  The return of Futurama soured me on the concept of bringing shows back for a long time.  The thing of it is, though, Josh Schwartz has already made it clear that they wouldn't bring Chuck back in any form unless they had a great story to tell.  This petition, if it gets Netflix's attention, might just give Pedak and him a reason to see if they can come up with one (or more)."
chuck,3ahefj,DantheManFoley,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:29:48 2015 UTC,Wait what was wrong with futurama coming back?
chuck,3ahefj,jefftakeover,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"To an extent, I agree, but then I look at Yahoo with Community. Seasons 1 - 3 were fine. 4 and 5 were under threats of cancellation. After cancellation, Yahoo took it and made a season 6. It felt like the earlier seasons, even with missing a few of the original cast. It turned out rather well. If they could get the initial crew back for Chuck, Netflix could do the same thing and bring another good season or two."
chuck,3ahefj,SgtWaffles2424,11,Sat Jun 20 18:46:34 2015 UTC,"The show ended good, it never overstayed its welcome , and was always compelling tv, not filler.... However .... with the way the show ended it would ruin the majority of season 5 to simply revive chuck again, not to mention there being no guarantee that the revived show would be any good at all."
chuck,3ahefj,suss2it,4,Sat Jun 20 09:36:54 2015 UTC,I'm surprise to see comments not wanting a revival. I feel that the ending left it open to have the series brought back and would welcome it.
chuck,3ahefj,Topshot27,4,Sat Jun 20 13:20:10 2015 UTC,Nooooooo
chuck,3ahefj,OptimisticDuck,2,Sat Jun 20 07:25:15 2015 UTC,Do these petitions ever actually amount to anything?
chuck,3ahefj,kinght6,10,Sat Jun 20 09:31:21 2015 UTC,no
chuck,3ahefj,dukefan15,3,Sat Jun 20 12:40:57 2015 UTC,"It depends on the goal and the audience.  If the petition was trying to strong arm NBC or the creators to bring the show back, there's no chance it would work.  But this petition seems to be attempting to show Netflix that there is sufficient interest in Chuck to explore the possibility of bringing it back.  If enough people sign, I have to believe they would at least reach out to Josh Schwartz and Chris Pedak about it."
chuck,3ahefj,360triplescope,2,Sat Jun 20 15:26:48 2015 UTC,I feel like Chuck ended fine as it was. More seasons I feel would ruin the show unless they have AMAZING story arcs. I would be fine with just a movie or maybe a miniseries or an episode to give us closure on the season 5 ending.

chuck,3ahgin,fretspyder,4,Sat Jun 20 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"S3E13, The Antlers - ""Kettering."" On the bridge with Shaw, the most perfect ambiance that moment deserved. S1E10, Band of Horses - ""No One's Gonna Love You."" The phones ringing, Sophie's Choice moment for Sarah. Bryce or Chuck. In hindsight, those lyrics are stunningly accurate if viewed from the end of the series. S5E13, Jeffster! - ""Take on Me."" One word, Jeffster!, it's the finale, and it's a song I loved when I was a kid that I can no longer here without a gut-punch in the Feels. S04E09, Nico Stai - ""Miss Friday."" The way she goes up to his shirt... Sarah passed Chuck as my favorite character at that moment.  S4E13, The Naked and Famous - ""Young Blood."" Scene ends on that Janitor, and in the background... this is where the series ends in my head, I love all of the seasons, but this moment was perfection. No words..."
