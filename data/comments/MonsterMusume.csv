Monster musume looked pretty interesting, so I flopped out the little friend. The ""tskonumis"" or comments, said something about the hardcore original monster girl comic, so I searched for that too. Ever since I found about MM, I searched Mangahere every month ready for another wank. While in the middle of the happy fun time, a tskonumi said something about a MM anime coming out which had me stoked(stroked, heh heh). Then later on, I figured reddit must have some sort of MM site for wankers such as myself, so that's how I found about this sub reddit.  TL;DR, horny wanker went looking for a spank bank"

He really is an easy going guy.   *edit:  I'm actually more curious if the Metal Gear reference will stay. Especially now that Konami and Hideo Kojima had that big falling out.

MonsterMusume,3e2m7b,Runeweaver,3,Tue Jul 21 14:48:44 2015 UTC,Yep.  Will most likely stay. ZUN only doesn't like it when his works (characters) are sexualised ...except there's a mountain of it ;but he said that he won't stop it either way.
MonsterMusume,3e2m7b,Runeweaver,4,Tue Jul 21 18:39:44 2015 UTC,I didn't know he said that. Though given just how much Touhou hentai there is... they didn't listen

MonsterMusume,3dysbk,zferolie,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:33 2015 UTC,Yup same here. I finally got my miia one shipped and it should beat me home by the time I get back from my business trip (reason why I've been so inactive from reddit lately)   Currently in france right now and I can't wait to get back to the UK so I can see my miia <3   Also it seriously better be worth the wait. I mean $40 is a great deal and all. But honestly I'd rather pay $100 just so I could have had it within a week lol.
MonsterMusume,3dysbk,Miia-san,3,Mon Jul 20 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"The Miia one was really good, but since I still live with parents(so much cheaper to do so) I had to get what I felt was the least riske. Though Suu also being my second favorite helped a lot.  Ah UK huh. I wonder if the shipping time is the same to UK as it is in America.  Yeah I paid 40 bucks as well. I think as long as it gets here I can live with a bit of a delay in shipping. Also gives me time to find the right size pillow for her."
MonsterMusume,3dysbk,AmiiboPuff,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:52 2015 UTC,"Figured you by that 7-Meter Miia Daikumura, to be honest. Then maybe use it hang along the walls in your Miia shrine. But it's pretty expensive..."

MonsterMusume,3dysbk,DystopianKing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:26:25 2015 UTC,"I think you would have to stuff it with cotton, not a Pillow. The Suu one I ordered, the seller said I should buy his cotton to stuff it with. I am just going to look for a pillow, which I know I can get at Target"
MonsterMusume,3dysbk,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:13 2015 UTC,the seller said I should buy his cotton to stuff it with.     Because he wants you to buy more from him duh. Also where did you buy yours from eBay? I just say they were going for 10 pounds on eBay right after I ordered mine from the official store for 20 pounds.   Although I'm wondering if they're the same material or not. Because the store I ordered from (I also ordered the regular btw) also offered 3 different types of slik which actually I probably should have got for the extra 40 pounds. But I couldn't afford 40 more pounds sadly so I just stuck with the regular.   After all its just going to hang up on the wall. Its not like I'll be fondling with it. Although I may get another in the future (depending on if they plan on making more designs) after all they already have two miia designs. Just such a shame the real deal costs 400 pounds.
MonsterMusume,3dysbk,bluemeep,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I knew he just wanted me to buy more, but I can see cotton the only option for a 7 meter one.

I did not know they are also selling on E-bay, did they just go up recently? It could be the same seller as mine, just with an E-bay account.  The basic lowest fabric is peach skin, and the best is 2way. I used this video to figure it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmvxLvYpTzA   I am going to put Suu on a pillow right now, since I like pillows to hug while I sleep, plus I have no room on the walls of my room(its not that big)"

There also is a gray area with animated/illustrated things of that nature anyway, but that is a topic for another thread on another subreddit. (Or perhaps another site, now that reddit is braking down on that stuff.)  In the end, if it's sold on Amazon and will ship to you, it's legal to buy and own. Believe me, Amazon is far more concerned about the legality of what they're selling. They have a lot more to lose with the warehouse of... ""questionable material"" they possess. You can trust that they have already looked into this for you.   They know exactly what they're selling. ;)  Also, fun side note: The Evangelion anime technically walked a finer line than Monster Musume. Just on the fact that the main characters were all high school age.   And that anime is considered to be a classic."

MonsterMusume,3dwj04,Siedrah,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"It normally takes them 2 to 4 weeks to release a chapter once they get the raws. What takes them the longest is the clean up. Unlike other translations groups, the group the does Monster Musume translate everything on the page, which includes non-dialogue text not in word balloons (like sound effects). Once they erase the Japanese text they have to fix the art under it before they put the English text down. How much clear up there is and the schedules of their clean up artist will be the ultimate deciding factor on when they get it out. Sometimes other groups will translate it too but not as cleanly."

MonsterMusume,3duag7,RealityRush,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:54:57 2015 UTC,You can set it up so that it wrapes around on the top of your bed. Its probably as close as being coiled up by Miia as your going to get.

MonsterMusume,3dnp7m,JayEster,4,Fri Jul 17 19:26:13 2015 UTC,"Well, as long as they don't replace the japanese voice / we will get dual audio then I'm fine with it. Personally, I like to hear anime with japanese voice. But if it's handled professionally like (for example) Persona 4 anime, then  I don't mind."
MonsterMusume,3dnp7m,Yosumarainesu,2,Sat Jul 18 07:59:07 2015 UTC,Every single American anime release has dual audio.  Edit: with an English dub
MonsterMusume,3dnp7m,dcresistance,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:39:40 2015 UTC,"Not true, Maoyu Mao Yusha only had Japanese audio."
MonsterMusume,3dnp7m,TheOneMavado,3,Sat Jul 18 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe it depends on its popularity. An english dub could work if they hire the right VA's. Im still gonna buy it dub or not, as long as they put all 12 eps together and don't put them in separate volumes."
MonsterMusume,3dnp7m,kiks493,4,Sat Jul 18 06:23:01 2015 UTC,Way too early to judge.  Though Sentai already purchased licensing rights.

MonsterMusume,3dk7q1,zferolie,3,Fri Jul 17 02:50:48 2015 UTC,I was bored and gave 4chan a look. Found this and since the words matched the pictures i figured it was real.
MonsterMusume,3dk95y,kiks493,3,Thu Jul 16 23:10:02 2015 UTC,I actually find this more adorable than I do sexual.... weird.  Well done!
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,zferolie,14,Thu Jul 16 16:54:17 2015 UTC,I dreamt about mg as a kid I was weird
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,The1andonlygogoman64,11,Thu Jul 16 18:01:58 2015 UTC,And now we can all be weird as adults.
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Misdraevus,6,Thu Jul 16 18:58:27 2015 UTC,I did also but only centaurs. All the others scared me but I grew up on AD&D.
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Reformingsaint,5,Thu Jul 16 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"I grew up on AD&D   My nigga.  But really, I don't think I've ever been really scared of monstergirls. In fact, I've loved Driders for as long as i can recall."
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Kadakism,4,Fri Jul 17 00:30:17 2015 UTC,I have a fear of spiders and snakes. Gotten the fear of snakes lowered thanks to a ball python but I kill spiders with a hairspray and lighter on sight. So driders have always been a toss up on attraction and fear. Kind of ironic considering arachinee.
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Reformingsaint,7,Fri Jul 17 02:29:10 2015 UTC,"This reminds me how weird as fuck I am because I'm the only person I know that isn't afraid of spiders. In fact, I go out of my way to not kill them. Spider in the shower? Yo home boy, you might wanna watch out, shits about to get wet.  Probably because I hate mosquitoes and flies, and spiders kill them. And in the last year it's gotten to the point where I'm actually very fond of spiders. Probably has something to do with Elise from LoL and Rachnee."
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Razeerka,3,Fri Jul 17 05:59:42 2015 UTC,"I would leavey spiders alone but since they refuse to show me their underside, I can't tell if their black widows or not. I live in black widow and brown recluse territory so I don't take chances.  I still think Rachinee is sexy but I would be afraid of her irl if we met."
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Reformingsaint,3,Fri Jul 17 12:14:01 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with pictures and videos of any kind of spiders, but anything bigger than an inch IRL I just can't stand. I'll never kill them though, I just catch them and throw them out. Driders ftw though."
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Misdraevus,2,Fri Jul 17 07:09:28 2015 UTC,That's the thrill of Rachnee. Spiders are spooky but Rachnee is hot as fuck. It gets you all confused in your pants and then one thing leads to another and whoops now I'm caught in the web.
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,xSPYXEx,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"Very true, her adorableness along with her sexiness is what attracts me to her. I just know I would be a deer in headlights if we met irl. And that's what keeps going through my mind and confused boners."
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Reformingsaint,2,Sat Jul 18 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"So, I think the time when I first really started liking Monstergirls was during a Ptolus campaign.  With the Brotherhood of something or 'nother allowing for ""alignment evil only"" monsters to be reformed and civilized, the idea was there.  I grew into it after a character died and my new one went toe to toe with a medusa.  That was the first time i really thought it would be awesome to have a monster as a friend... and then fantasy went from there."
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,letfireraindown,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:26 2015 UTC,The campaign that did it for me was a custom one that my dm managed to add a slave market to the whole thing because I was the only one willing to play. Bought a female centaur that we basically kicked ass in. I couldn't stop smiling after spearing a couple goblins while riding her. I went to sleep with that image in my 8 yr old mind. Kept that image with me in the worst of times to cheer me up and became more perverted as I grew older. Now I can't remember the characters name for the life of me.
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,Reformingsaint,2,Fri Jul 17 22:57:52 2015 UTC,That's kinda awesome!
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,letfireraindown,6,Sat Jul 18 06:20:05 2015 UTC,I didn't learn about monster girls till later in life sadly :(
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,AmiiboPuff,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:19 2015 UTC,I must be like only kid who didn't see monsters like monster girls as a kid here then...Maybe my monsters were more maybe too realistic like deformed human-like beings as murderers or arsonists...
MonsterMusume,3diu5w,DeathKidFTW,11,Fri Jul 17 02:37:25 2015 UTC,"They just had to realize that there wasn't any reason to be scared of them in the first place. Really, they are just like us."

MonsterMusume,3diogt,Deafiler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:50:45 2015 UTC,They're all unlisted in the hopes that they are more unlikely to be removed.  Though they still appear in google searches for some reason.

Although, thanks for taking the time to write out what will be happening for the next few episodes (too lazy to read the manga now since the anime is out hehe)   Also So fucking pumped for episode 4. Miia and kurusu are gonna be ""some what"" getting it on in that bed room ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  edit : god damn, 2 months until rachnee's introduction </3 I can't wait to see her animated."
MonsterMusume,3dfssh,Miia-san,3,Thu Jul 16 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"I commend you for taking the time and putting this up. My prediction is that the blu Ray maybe flying off the shelf for the ecchi and not the storyline. I'll admit, the idea of monstergirl living with someone attracted me but I stayed because of the storyline. The nudity was just bonus but realized how much the Manga has nudity after watching the first two episodes. Granted, they expanded a little on ms. Smith in her undies but I'm predicting there will be a lot more concentration on those regions than the Manga. I'm not complaining but I'm saying we might lose fans when this season is over. Don't we have 2 seasons already promised to us?"
MonsterMusume,3dfssh,Reformingsaint,4,Thu Jul 16 01:53:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to summarize each chapter for all of us.  I do have to agree with the majority of your Prediction, I do have a different theory: Episode 10-12 Will be dates episodes as you suggested but expanded.   Episode 12 will be Date with the M.O.N. girls expanded for the half hour. Why? Because in the manga, we get a basic date montage for each M.O.N girl before getting to a touch moment with the girl which can easily be expanded. There's several unused ideas mentioned in MM Secret's pages that can be used like Tio's love of sweets for a trip to a candy shop/bakery before they shop for clothing. And as you noticed they've been getting pushed just as hard as the main harem both in the ending and merchandising, they know the fans will want them to get their time to shine. And they could also add in scenes of the main girls spying on the M.O.N. dates for filler too if needed.  And the last 5 minutes being Doppel's exposure and ending the first season on a cliffhanger with the second letter. And would make for a strong opening for a second season. And it would explain why Lala isn't really included the anime yet and downplayed in the merchandise.  Of course, this is all assuming they don't go for the dreaded ""Anime Only"" Ending. =/"
MonsterMusume,3dfssh,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:42:33 2015 UTC,Since they're skipping the shedding chapter for now.  Episode 4 would be Suu's introduction and the watergun fight.  Episode 5 Will likely be Hide Suu and Mero joining the household.  Episode 6 Might be all about MON.

MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,reallygoodbee,20,Wed Jul 15 02:44:37 2015 UTC,"Er, I'm with Jay in that it'll probably be a harem ending where he just marries the lot of them somehow.  I mean, it's technically bestiality already, why not polygamy too?  If he were to pick one though, I'd guess Miia.  The rest of them seem more concerned with Kimihito as an idea, rather than for his love.  Miia's whole focus is him, not some idealism involving him."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,RealityRush,8,Wed Jul 15 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"That's kinda how I've felt about it the whole time. A lot of people say best girl stuff and I'm like how can it not be Miia? If we're trying to say who looks best, you're arguing aesthetics that needn't be touched. If you argue who is the best personality, it has to be Miia. They all have good personalities, but Miia seems to best fit him. Also, I mean, he seems to care for all of them, but it almost never seems like he showed any interest of any real consequence except when concerning Miia. Just how I saw it though."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,LeJumpshot,2,Wed Jul 15 11:25:47 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, yeah :P"
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,RealityRush,6,Wed Jul 15 12:17:42 2015 UTC,"The rest of them seem more concerned with Kimihito as an idea, rather than for his love.   This is a good point, and something I hadn't considered until now."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,CQBPlayer,4,Wed Jul 15 05:01:04 2015 UTC,"Heh, well I mean, Cerea just wants to be a knight for a master, Arachnera is kinda just running from her past, Mero has her weird tragic love thing, Papi is well, Papi.  Miia is at least obsessed with him specifically."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,RealityRush,5,Wed Jul 15 12:16:08 2015 UTC,"""The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.""  -Suu"
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,CQBPlayer,4,Wed Jul 15 21:18:24 2015 UTC,Yeah..... Suu I don't really know what to think of.  I guess neither does she O.o
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,RealityRush,3,Wed Jul 15 21:35:02 2015 UTC,Suu seems to have essentially bonded herself to him as a way to mimmick everyone else's affection. The question is whether her extremely rapidly evolving intelligence will cling to the emotions created from copying the others or not
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,henryuuk,4,Thu Jul 16 22:27:29 2015 UTC,Why not Zoidberg?
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,warincon,4,Wed Jul 15 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"I've gotta disagree on the idealism thing. Yes Miia is the most logical choice since she is unconditionally in love with Kimihito. But Kimihito is also the only person Papi actively remembers/loves even with her scatter brained memory (it was revealed when her mother showed up that it's rare for a harpy to stay with one male for very long). Centorea refused to use him as a teaser so the male centaurs could get with the ladies, and she fought her mother solely so she could have the right to stay with Kimihito. Suu believes that she will be the most beneficial towards making Kimihito's life easier, and loves him for treating her like more than just a thoughtless slime. Mero is a bit of a wild card cause she's starting to regret her desires to be like the little mermaid (She got jealous of Miia at one point if my memory is correct). And Rachnera loves him cause he's the first to see her as anything other than a creepy spider lady. They have each grown a large amount of affection towards him because he treats them as if they were normal human girls despite the obvious indications that they are not. I'm assuming it will somehow end in a harem as well, but if it does come down to a monogamous marriage then Miia has got to be the most logical choice."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,SeattleLMP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"Papi is the one other person I could see the argument for actually loving Kimihito, but Centorea for sure is just being idealistic.  She wants to be his knight, she makes that abundantly clear, even if she's chivalrous about it.  Rachnera is really just trying to escape her unfortunate past and Kimi is just the first person not to be a dick to her without strings attached (pun intended).  Mero may eventually like him for him, and she's starting to, but at the moment it's still just  an idea.  Suu.......... Suu I have a hard time pinning down with anything in particular, so.... yeah, wutevs.  I'd say Miia is the most likely choice, then Papi, then Mero if she works her shit out."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,RealityRush,14,Wed Jul 15 20:08:59 2015 UTC,"I don't want the ride to ever end.  No marriage, no harem, just every day almost dying and building a castle full of monster girls and caring for them all equally forever until he dies.  And then Lala gets him."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,Backupusername,10,Wed Jul 15 05:16:22 2015 UTC,Lala wins the hand no matter the outcome! :D
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,letfireraindown,13,Wed Jul 15 05:19:37 2015 UTC,Only one possible ending: harem ending.

MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,_IAlwaysLie,2,Wed Jul 15 03:23:06 2015 UTC,In the anime opening they are all seen wearing wedding gowns and then them all laying around him. Harem is definitly an eventual option.
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,henryuuk,7,Thu Jul 16 22:29:31 2015 UTC,picking? why do that
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,WayneCarlton,6,Wed Jul 15 03:50:45 2015 UTC,"Methinks Miia. She and Kimhito seem to connect better than the others, at least in my opinion."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,no_data_here,5,Wed Jul 15 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"I find he tends to connect fairly well with Rachnee. I mean, she's the only one who has never hurt him. Despite her demeanor, she shows a ton of restraint around him, and she seems to understand what he's going through being forced to just pick someone."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,no_data_here,3,Wed Jul 15 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"I can see that working too, but I think I  see more of a romantic connection between Kimhito and Miia, as opposed to more of a trusted friend relationship with Kimhito and Rachnee."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,no_data_here,6,Wed Jul 15 17:46:50 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I think it'll come down to Miia and Rachnee, and I'm rooting for Rachnee.  Because really, look at the other girls: Papi is an idiot. She's much more of a little sister than an actual wife candidate, physically and mentally, and she forgets some pretty important things pretty fast.  Centorea is just far too over-protective. She's got a strong chance, really, but she's kind of over-bearing and is way too enthusiastic about protecting him and ensuring his safety, even though she's probably done the most damage to him.  Suu has a good chance, and she's got some great qualities, but she's far too prone to smothering him.  Mero, like Suu, has almost drowned Kimihito twice now because she gets wrapped up in her own little world. And I'm not sure if she even wants to marry him because of her Little Mermaid Tragic Romance fantasy. Also, she's a princess. We haven't met her parents yet, but I'm sure they won't approve of him being such a low-class human.  And Lala isn't interested in marriage. She just has to wait, and he'll become hers when he dies."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,Grimmhoof,4,Wed Jul 15 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"So, in essence we agree on either Miia or Rachnee, but (for reasons that make perfect sense) disagree on which one has better odds."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,bkwrm13,4,Wed Jul 15 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, yeah."
MonsterMusume,3dc2yz,_IAlwaysLie,3,Wed Jul 15 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"Also, worth noting, Kimihito is a leg man.  +1 for Rachnee XD"

However I WANT it to happen soonish, and than have the show move on to various high-jinks within their married lives afterwords.  There's plenty of conflicts and great situations that could come from them all being married together and having to share darling."

MonsterMusume,3d8pri,BlueXanthus,7,Tue Jul 14 17:04:09 2015 UTC,Whoever's doing the subtitles need to shape up. You can clearly hear that Papi and Cerea use a different word to address the MC.  Not to mention Papi constantly referring to herself in third-person.
MonsterMusume,3d8pri,TheOneMavado,5,Tue Jul 14 19:07:01 2015 UTC,"Fansubs will come in soon.  That'll give everybody what they want.  Technically, Papi is calling Darling ""boss"".  but its subbed master."
MonsterMusume,3d8pri,BlueXanthus,5,Tue Jul 14 19:36:56 2015 UTC,"No, both Papi's 'goshujin' and Centoria's 'aruji' can mean 'master'.  In this context, 'goshujin' can also be read as either 'husband' or 'owner', while 'aruji' can also mean 'lord' or 'head of the house'.  Neither of them is read as 'boss'. If you're going mainly off the manga's translation, know that 'boss' is not very accurate."
MonsterMusume,3d8pri,slartitentacles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"Is ""goshujin"" what Papi calls Darling in the manga? I always saw it translated as ""husband"" or ""hubby"" so I assumed it was ""danna""."
MonsterMusume,3d8pri,Backupusername,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:35 2015 UTC,"It'd be a little weird for Papi to use 'danna' since its also the word that geisha use to refer to their patron.  Both Papi's 'goshujin' and Centoria's 'aruji' have multiple ways of reading them that changes as the story progresses from simply living together towards marriage. Both words say a lot about the character's personality and how they relate to Darling.  Papi needs an 'owner' to keep her at first, and then later she wants Darling to be her 'husband'. 'Goshujin' applies to both readings.  Centoria wants a 'lord' that she can pledge her loyalty to, and then later she wants Darling to become her 'husband/head of the house'. 'Aruji' applies to all those readings.  'Danna' is actually the word that Mero uses to refer to Darling. She's the one for whom the 'geisha's patron' connotation fits with the most.  Its kinda hard to properly communicate the intricacies of the word they're using to refer to Darling when translating it into English, cuz 'goshujin', 'aruji', and 'danna' are totally different words that also mean 'husband' and 'master'."
MonsterMusume,3d8pri,slartitentacles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"Thinking about subtitles does anyone else think the ""incest/deport"" issue should be changed to ""incest/arrest"" when they put it into English so that the words have a similar sound to them. I mean Papi's a birdbrain but deport and incest aren't exactly the closest sounding things."
MonsterMusume,3d8pri,BrotherAriman,2,Fri Jul 17 22:20:41 2015 UTC,Let's hope they change it.
MonsterMusume,3d8pri,818181291,10,Tue Jul 14 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"Just finished watching the episode on Crunchyroll and I gotta say, I'm even more impressed then last week. Seeing Cerea's chase scene really brought the manga to life for me as they added those dramatic action angles while keeping the bit we saw in the manga.  And a warning, The Ice Cream scene with Papi during the first half is just as ""sensual"" as the opening scene with Miia last week. So, you might wanna keep the volume down."

MonsterMusume,3d4dku,zferolie,5,Mon Jul 13 15:21:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. But you also have to keep in mind, monmusu has a super huge fan base (although surprisingly lacking the merchandise and fanart)   MonMusu sells 1,000,000 comics both in the US and in japan. (not sure about Europe) nearly every issue (Okaydo has sold over several million books)   Which this gives them the chance to create a great animation because they're working with high quality professionals and not your average animators."
MonsterMusume,3d4dku,Miia-san,5,Mon Jul 13 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"Its almost surprising how popular it is. Monster girls are really looked down upon, and people just say they are nothing but sex, and give people a lot of crap for liking them. For Oka to constantly sell millions of copies is amazing.  It is great that they were able to get some good talent. They obviously are putting a lot of love into this"
MonsterMusume,3d4dku,zferolie,2,Mon Jul 13 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"Monster girls are really looked down upon, and people just say they are nothing but sex, and give people a lot of crap for liking them.   Fuck those people.  Monster Musu is hilarious, I don't give a fuck about any fetishist stuff, it is just damn hilarious.  Adult smut humour at its finest!  What people want to beat off to is up to them, but that isn't the main selling point of Mon Musu I feel.  I never watch eechi/harem/romcoms, ever.  This is the first one just because of how unique and hilarious it is.  Poor Kurusu is in a hellavu situation, lol."

It's off-the-wall crazy and the show puts so much enthusiasm into having fun, no shame, no strings.  It reminds me a lot of RWBY in the sense that the creators really seem like they have a fun time making it, no matter how silly or absurd it gets.  It's a rare quality to find in a show, and I can't watch depressing, high-rated tragedies all the time without a bit of a pick-me-up ;P"
MonsterMusume,3d4dku,RealityRush,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"I mainly like really exotic and different, which what drew me towards it first, and just the sheer amount of creativity in monster girl works kept me.

Monster girls is a reason why I still want to make my slime girl game, even though I haven't had much time to work on it.

MonsterMusume,3d4dku,henryuuk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"Monster girls are really looked down upon, and people just say they are nothing but sex, and give people a lot of crap for liking them.   seems to be all the rage in japan lately, and not a lot of people are giving a lot of crap to them over there. Because the fact they even had a festible just kind of shows that. I don't think I've ever heard of a manga or anime having its own festible before.  But yeah I can kind of see where people would get that idea. ""because of the tentacle fetish"" or something like that. I mean if you were around the time at the beginning of furries (like early 90's) furries started becoming a thing. But then everyone started it into something sexual and then started giving people who were new to things with furries (like duck tales) shit just for even liking it.   For Oka to constantly sell millions of copies is amazing.   I agree, I mean if he would only focus on MonMusu instead of 12 beasts. He could make the very first harem on going series. (like have them get married eventually at the beginning) and then all the girls just go on little adventures or something. Its common for harems to end around 12 - 24 episodes (6 volumes) but Okaydo's series is just so popular that it could seriously blow up.   They obviously are putting a lot of love into this   I almost want to say Okaydo wanted to get a animation studio that could just do the job. But my feeling is that the animation studio is just a huge fan of his and just wanna go all out :P"
MonsterMusume,3d4dku,Miia-san,0,Mon Jul 13 16:20:46 2015 UTC,"I know its popping now, but it wasn't always this huge. Did Okaydo make that happen, or was it a combination of things? It seems like all these monster girl mangas started around the same time (MonMus, Centaur Life, Nurse Hitomi)  I grew up with Duck tales and The Sonic SatAM with Princess Sally. She I think got a lot of people into furries. I think Monster girls got mixed into the negitive view some furries get, which TV doesn't help with. I remember an CSI episode where they went to a furry con and encountered a Yiff pile.  One thing I noticed that some monster girls get a worse rep then others. Slimes mostly. Thats a reason why I am developing a video game staring a slime girl.  It sounds like her alternates between Mon and 12. I got vol 2 of 12 the other day, and liked it, but I haven't seen any scanlations of it past vol 2, unless I am not looking at the right places. I like 12 beasts, and I want him to continue working on that, but not neglect Mon either. I see Mon doing a lot of cool things with the world of monsters and humans interacting. I do think we should see more monster boys though, mainly in a good light I mean. The orcs and Centaur male got painted poorly. I am interested in seeing some good monster men, and girls going for them. Even if just for a chapter.  I wonder how much input and control he has over the anime. They aren't straying so far, but wonder if he is too busy to look over stuff"
MonsterMusume,3d4dku,zferolie,0,Mon Jul 13 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"I know its popping now, but it wasn't always this huge.   it was always huge, it was just more of an underground thing. Okaydo just made it more popular to the public. I mean artists like Dr.Comet are what really made furries HUGE back in the early 00's when furry porn first started coming out. (and fuck all he did was a bunch of OC's and Fanart) if he would have created a manga. I bet it probably would have sold as well as monster musume if not better. Because Comet was a pretty talented artist.   Princess Sally    yeah I can see that. Although I think me as a kid was already a little into furries when sonic started coming out because I remember amy being my favorite character. (No reason back then) but we know why now nudge    I remember an CSI episode where they went to a furry con and encountered a Yiff pile.   ew, not a fan of csi (but you gotta see if you can find a link somewhere I wanna see this)    I like 12 beasts, and I want him to continue working on that, but not neglect Mon either   I've only read half of the first chapter and it instantly felt like a TWGOK/dog days (combined) ripoff to me with staring humanoid versions of the monmusu cast. (because cmon the main girl at the beginning is clearly miia) he isn't fooling anybody. Its just miia with legs is all.    I wonder how much input and control he has over the anime. They aren't straying so far, but wonder if he is too busy to look over stuff   He probably gets to browse some stuff, and judge upon them. But most likely since he's working on two different manga now. Its most likely he's just in his studio right now focusing on getting them done. Because as a mangaka you don't get a lot of time to relax. Even when you get an anime just released. The only time you ever get to probably relax is when you finish the series. (which monster musume is no where done) I'd say we're just beginning. Considering we keep getting more and more characters introduced to us, and he really hasn't taken the story anywhere yet. I'd say we can at least expect 20 volumes at the most. (but this is just a logical guess.)"
MonsterMusume,3d4dku,Miia-san,0,Mon Jul 13 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"I can beleive it was an underground hit. We had things like Monster girl quest(which I still need to play) and The monster girl encyclopedia. Still, Okaydo and others were able to bring it to the main stream. I am surprised people even let them try, though it may be because it is japan. I don't see an american comic company doing something like this.  I do like Amy a lot too... though Blaze is my favorite, followed by ROuge. Damn they just went super sexy for rouge. Though I Also love Cream, but mainly because she is freaking adorable.  I don't watch CSI either, I saw this episode on a plane flight, and was fasinated on just how much they went with every negitive and sometimes false perception of Furries. The episode was called Fur and Loathing. Here it is oh hulu, but I am sure other websites have it as well http://www.hulu.com/watch/748943  sounds like you actually read the pilot chapter, not the actual chapter. That one stared a Lizard girl. The main one has him with a Harpy. As of the end of volume 2, he has 2 harpies and a Minataur that would put Mio to shame http://12-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Asterio They are going to go for what looks like a ocotpus girl that looks like the sorcerers from Dragon's Crown http://www.mangahere.co/manga/12_beast/c009/38.html . and also it looks like he will get many girls not seen in MonMus http://www.mangahere.co/manga/12_beast/c001/2.html  yeah the life on a mangaka is intense, and hard. Oda from one peice I know has to had taken breaks due to fatigue and stress. I do wonder just what he can do plot wise. It seems very much how Ah My Goddess is. A SLice of life with fantastical stuff with plot arcs every so often. Not that I mind, I love the idea of exploring the world, and I hope we get many volumes"

Although I'd recommend you clearing up your calander for a few days just to watch it. Because I guarntee after you watch a couple of episodes you'll be instantly hooked wanting to know what's going to happen next. Bakuman had everyone in /r/anime that way. Because there was a megathread a while back ""Why did you enjoy bakuman?"" The top comment was basically the same thing I just said ""Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time"" with 1,000+ upvotes. (meaning 1,000+ people agree with him) so I'd highly you check it out. Something to let you know about (there are three seasons not just one) I wasn't aware there were three seasons up until recently. I was so disappointed when the first one ended because I was wondering what was gonna happen next (and thought I'd need to read the manga to find out.) then someone pointed me in the right direction. (and there's also a live action bakuman coming out soon which I'm hyped for) and I'm not usually a fan of live action anime shows."

MonsterMusume,3d51rc,zferolie,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:52 2015 UTC,so it is papi... but what on earth is she saying?
MonsterMusume,3d51rc,TheOneMavado,2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:02 2015 UTC,Sounds like she found the bidet setting on the toilet.  Related Image (slightly NSFW)
MonsterMusume,3d51rc,zferolie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:32:32 2015 UTC,Ah one of those things. That would surprise poor papi lol.  And was this image made before this episode? seems like an odd coincidence

MonsterMusume,3d51rc,Miia-san,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:36:59 2015 UTC,"Might be referencing old fanart pics (which is a cool thing for the animation studio to do).  Would be kind of cool to see that fanart manga be turned into an ova of some sort. The manga is very strange but also has more of an actual story to it. (although you see ""miia's dad"") in it too. Which for some reason is a lamia.   Male lamia's don't exist    Before anyone says, but to be fair this was before volume 7 (before we learn that the lamia race is all female)  But to be fair, in Greek mythology, it is said that male lamias exist. But nothing said about mating.   is it possible male lamias went extinct in the monmusu universe?"
MonsterMusume,3d51rc,zferolie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:12:20 2015 UTC,It's cool that they are referencing old art. thats a fun thing for them to do for these short shorts  so far the only confirmed female only races are Lamia's and Harpies right? Are there only female Arachne as well?
MonsterMusume,3d51rc,zferolie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:14:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure on Arachne since we've gotten more focus on her ""almost-One-Piece-levels-of-tragic"" backstory then the race as a whole. And I'm not saying that sarcastically, that was pretty traumatic compared to all the other MM girls.  We could possible get more info about Arachne at the of the episode where she's introduced in like they did with subspecies for Lamia."

I mean yeah each short does get around 100,000 views a day. Which is still impressive just for 30 - 60 second clips. But still.

MonsterMusume,3criwq,CQBPlayer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:30:38 2015 UTC,MFW I saw this.
MonsterMusume,3criwq,warincon,2,Fri Jul 10 08:12:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, That's quite collection of MM stuff given most of this stuff just came out recently. Let start by thanking you for sharing the pictures with us. And now, I have two questions:  1) How did you get all of this stuff? Guessing you live in Japan, of course. Like, where did you go to buy it all? What did you spend?  2) Could you please tell us what a "" Dekanbatchi"" is? Cause it's been stumping us for a while now....  And don't be surprised if some people as you to scan in stuff for us all to enjoy like the Illustration Cards and Character Arts."
MonsterMusume,3criwq,AmiiboPuff,2,Fri Jul 10 05:31:15 2015 UTC,"1) Yeah, I am lucky to be living in Japan right while this anime is airing, so I decided to seize the opportunity and collect anime merch for the first time ever.   Everything I bought came from Akihabara, but different stores give you different freebies/bonuses when you buy MM goods. For example, the Monmusu festival that started on 7/1 (you may have seen the poster) in Aki stated that nine different stores would be giving away different coasters with every MM purchase. It was a lot of walking, but in the end that's how I got my coaster set.  2) A dekanbatchi is like... a large dinner plate/frisbee thing. In the back there is a stand you pull out from the base, similar to a picture frame. The material of the circle is very stiff, and thick. It is essentially just a picture though. When I get back home from work I'll see if I can explain it better.  At the moment I am living with a host family and I don't think I should bring MM items to work, so if someone asks, I will try to find a place where I can use their scanners. I would love to share these pics with other fans!"
MonsterMusume,3criwq,AmiiboPuff,4,Fri Jul 10 05:44:46 2015 UTC,I'm going to speak for r/monstermusume and seriously thank you for the photos of all this amazing stuff. Most of us could only dream of see this stuff in person without spending a small fortune.  And also for confirming and explain some ideas we've had going here recently when it came to the Monmusu festival and dekanbatchi.   Please don't do anything that'll get you in trouble with your host family or your work. :)
MonsterMusume,3criwq,AmiiboPuff,2,Fri Jul 10 05:53:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I should be thanking you and Miia-san for giving me such a nice welcome to the subreddit!  It feels great to get to meet people who love Monmusu just like me."
MonsterMusume,3criwq,blackZabdi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:10:41 2015 UTC,I found a video on youtube where someone talks about a Dekanbatchi they bought. You can get a clear idea of what the item is like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi24wjnmMAU

MonsterMusume,3criwq,Miia-san,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:07:17 2015 UTC,"i have liked monster girls for some time, but only recently can I support my love outside of adult stuff :p  I would love to get a second season, but do we have any idea how far the anime may go? Maybe up to Lala? If it goes that far there may need to be a break to let the manga get a bit ahead"
MonsterMusume,3criwq,Miia-san,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:20:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm, considering the Monmusu website lists 6 BD/DVD items that will come out in the future, I imagine there will only be 12 eps (2 eps per disc, as usual).   I hear that the anime is running at a rate of 2 chapters per episode, so we will at least get up to Chapter 24 I think (which puts us right after Lala's debut). That seems like an awkward time to pause, so maybe we will get an anime original ending? (Hopefully not a sudden stop...)"
MonsterMusume,3criwq,BladeLigerV,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"well that is going by just 2 episodes. They could do 1 chapter for 1 episode every so often as well. I feel that some chapters can work as full episodes.  I never understood why Japan only puts 2 episodes on a DVD, let alone a Bluray. Seems like a complete waste of the space.  They also could have an anime original ending, or a filler her or there.  12 episodes makes me a little said, but givin the length of the manga, I can see it happening. though they COULD go past that... maybe end around right after the mothers show up and the house breaks and all of darlings near death experiances"
MonsterMusume,3criwq,DonSerrot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:16:47 2015 UTC,"Before we jump to conclusions, let's keep in mind that the earlier chapters are shorter and a bit lighter on content then most of the later chapters from the MON girls introduction and on.   I'm guessing that around the time they'll introduce the MON girls, episodes will start to be about 1 to 1 to a chapter. So, I wouldn't be surprised that by the end of the episodes, they'll be in the mid- to late teens of the chapters ending the first season around the end of ""D"" arc with the big series cliff hanger being the second D letter. (Which should hopefully lead into to a second season)"

MonsterMusume,3cmpeh,BladeLigerV,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:40:44 2015 UTC,No Volumes 2 and 3?  And how is 12 Beast anyway?
MonsterMusume,3cmpeh,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"Theyre arriving today, and I actually prefer 12 beast over MM. I like the story and MC better, plus there are more monster girls (;"
MonsterMusume,3cmpeh,Miia-san,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"and I actually prefer 12 beast over MM.    whattttt.... 12 beasts is basically the same exact characters (except miia has legs)   its just so confusing seeing miia and cerea with normal bodies. Why has he done this for his last 3 series? (no wait 4 I think) because he had done a similar series like 12 beasts a bit before monmusu.   I think I could probably get into it, but only if it had different characters. It just seriously bothers me seeing a familiar face and then expecting them to say some monmusu reference.   and imho, I just watched TWGOK not too long ago and have to honestly say it feels like okyado is kind of ripping off TWGOK and dog days?   Because what the MC is playing on his ""PSP"" and then travels to a new world all of a sudden? its just feels like a huge ""been there done that""   edit : even her ears are the same .-. although I'll admit she does kind of look sexy with leg stockings."
MonsterMusume,3cmpeh,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:28:17 2015 UTC,Miia with legs? That seems so wrong... .-.

MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,AmiiboPuff,3,Wed Jul 8 17:53:46 2015 UTC,Threw it on YouTube for future thread viewers.  edit: Started a playlist for these bonus clips.  I could only find a raw of the first one in 360p but the second one is 1080p.

MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,zferolie,3,Thu Jul 9 13:26:11 2015 UTC,I have a mirror of the video of miia cooking here and here's the one of her grooming
MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,Miia-san,2,Thu Jul 9 15:53:03 2015 UTC,Awesome. Its good to keep these just in case they never get released(though I doubt that will happen)
MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,zferolie,2,Thu Jul 9 16:01:01 2015 UTC,Its good to keep these just in case they never get released(though I doubt that will happen)   My theory is that they'll release them on a bluray disc as a bonus with the limited edition box set for die hard monmusu fans/vets (like myself :P)   but yeah as of right now I'm just storing them on my 500GB ssd. I know the quality is low (which is bullshit) but hey its better than nothing.  I really wish they would upload the 1080p version so I can get a couple nice wallpapers </3 I want a wallpaper of miia cooking.
MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,Miia-san,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt I myself will buy any special edition, though I hope the US gets it as well.  Is the quality issue due to Niconico? And yeah those can be made into good wallpaper"

MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,Miia-san,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:22 2015 UTC,Some people are quality nuts thought lol. what I watch depends on how fast my internet decides to run that day.  But yeah getting screenshots you almost need 1080

MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,RachneraArachnera,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"wow, that looks fucking great. Huge thank you for this.  Also, how did you manage to rip a 1080p file? I use vid.me and can't get anything higher than 480p :(    I'll upload the file to Mega and pm you the file in a couple hours if you want.   if you could just tell me how you did it through a PM so I can rip the videos for /r/monstermusumeshorts then please do.

MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,zferolie,2,Thu Jul 9 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"anyone have a translation on what she says? unlike the first one I feel like we miss the joke, though I assume its about her failing to cook"
MonsterMusume,3ckqtp,zferolie,3,Wed Jul 8 19:31:35 2015 UTC,She's talking about how much she loves eggs and then proceeds to throw the egg down the drain.

MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,RhetoricalGamer,17,Tue Jul 7 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed  While I like Monster Girl Encyclopedia, I prefer Okayado's art style and approach to monster girls. I mean, they sexually active like all species is expected but he also focuses on smaller/scientific facts of like how Miis sheds her skin or Rachnee getting drunk on coffee. MGE is basically a catalog to how each species has sex. =/"
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,AmiiboPuff,6,Tue Jul 7 21:31:15 2015 UTC,I would so buy an actual encyclopedia by Okayado about monster girls with facts and drawings. Kind like how the end of the manga has those fact sheets but more in detail and in color.
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,kiks493,6,Wed Jul 8 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"where was this posted? But sub specials makes sense though, since there are many types of snakes and humans."
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,zferolie,9,Tue Jul 7 18:27:21 2015 UTC,They showed this at the end of the episode. Pretty interesting can't wait to see the other types of species.

MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,zferolie,4,Tue Jul 7 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah it just pops up at the end, wasn't expecting it but not complaining. Cant wait to see the different arachne and centaurs if there are any."

MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,kiks493,2,Tue Jul 7 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"yeah the encyclopedia ones where all about the sex right? Like you said we see that a bit in his works but also them doing a lot of other stuff, like fighting crime, setting up a gym, and running a shrine."
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,zferolie,3,Tue Jul 7 19:14:51 2015 UTC,Thats why I like this manga they're people first and monster girls second.

MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,MyBananaNoseNoBounds,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"If.. If Lamia's require human males to reproduce, then did they evolve (or regress?) from a species that looked more snake-like and less human-like for their upper body, including full scales and a snake-shaped head (I'm only speculating, as I don't know)? Like, their history is that before they required human males to breed, did they reproduce asexually or were there male lamias at the time but was so extremely rare that they're on the verge of extinction?  I'm going to assume that that is the case either way, and that they only evolved to take on a more half-humanoid form when they started reproducing with human males to evolve their species."
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,DahjerCanaan,3,Tue Jul 7 23:42:17 2015 UTC,I would love a compendium of the species and hybrids. Okadayo please!
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure if that adds or subtracts from your species but in some species of snakes, females will sometimes become male snakes for protection from predators. And it can leading to false mating sessions.  So, it's not much a stretch to say that in times before mating with humans was thing, some Proto-Lamias would sometimes become male to keep the species going."
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,DahjerCanaan,2,Tue Jul 7 23:48:00 2015 UTC,"That's also what I thought because it's been proven that about spiders as well that some times when the ecosystem is lacking males or females to reproduce, some would take on the opposite gender to mate. Same thing with some species of frogs I've heard."
MonsterMusume,3cgcb7,xSPYXEx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:51:36 2015 UTC,I'm almost entirely certain we've seen this before. I think they even touch on it in the manga in the chapter where the drake tries to kidnap Miia.

When I was a kid and I'd play RPGs or action/adventures, I always saw these human/monster creatures and always kinda wondered what their lives were like when not on-screen in the game. And I always did feel a bit bad for slaughtering them, knowing they might have full lives before that fateful encounter.  Seeing that now, I felt like I came full circle after all these years."
MonsterMusume,3ch5x3,Miia-san,3,Tue Jul 7 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"ecchi going on borderline hentai   pretty much, the only way a hentai is actually considered hentai is if they show the penis (and or a sex scene) but yeah.

MonsterMusume,3cfzab,kiks493,8,Tue Jul 7 19:04:04 2015 UTC,Good point and i agree to an extent I just don't want it to be too out of character. But I'm totally fine with them making original stuff just i want them in character.
MonsterMusume,3cfzab,warincon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:34 2015 UTC,Well technically we are getting OC through the animated shorts they're posting everyday. But honestly other than that we haven't been really seeing too much OC.  But its possible the TOHO animation might make some OC for the OVA's. Because about 90% of the time anime OVA's are not relevant to the manga at all and are OC

However, given how much they been pushing this series in Japan, I wouldn't be surprised if it does well and get at least another season."

MonsterMusume,3cfs94,Miia-san,11,Fri Jul 10 22:28:05 2015 UTC,"Mirror for non Crunchyroll users   edit : so that was an interesting intro, also loving the voice of kimihito, I was expecting him to be more whiny (like miia's) personally can't say I'm too wild for miia's voice. But then again, I might just not be use to her actually having a voice. (edit 4 : So I watched the episode again, just upgraded to crunchyroll so I could watch with the subs, and actually I'm starting to love miias voice. Okaydo did a great job casting)   edit 2 : also god damn, its only 2am in japan? So the show aired 2 hours ago. Crunchyroll is seriously fucking impressive when it comes to translating. Ugh. Why can't crunchyroll translate manga too. I'd bet you we'd have the latest manga from japan translated in english within a month easily.   edit 3 : Hmm, Crunchyroll has 1080p. Yup switching to crunchyroll later this week. Expect /r/MonsterMusume to be flooded with screencaps soon hehe :P"
MonsterMusume,3cfs94,AmiiboPuff,3,Tue Jul 7 16:32:56 2015 UTC,Glad to hear you're warming up with Miia's voice. I believe it's a perfect fit not that we heard in sexual playfully and normal situations.

Starting with the beginning, it was a nice introduction to the characters with tons of funny moments. The opening was great and matched if not exceeded my expectations. The episode itself was well paced and had tons of comedic moments along with the ""aww, poor Miia"" moments. The ending song had me laughing. Overall, great episode and I'm extremely looking forward to seeing the next one same time on Tuesday. Only problems I had with this episode is the censorship. Not that I have a big problem with it, I just wish they wouldn't have done that. Then again, I'm watching it on Crunchyroll and another copy might be uncensored.   I really can't wait for ma girl Rachnera to get in this show, from what I've seen in the opening."
MonsterMusume,3cfs94,AmiiboPuff,4,Tue Jul 7 17:19:04 2015 UTC,Crunchyroll streams the TV edit from japan.   I'm sure the BD/DVD release will be uncensored.

Its a good adaptation, that art is good, and the voice acting was good as well(I like Miia's voice now after hearing it more). Also that opening was perfect. Two chapters per episode means they'll run out of material faster unless they're gonna make original stuff but thats okay with me as long as they don't go ooc."
MonsterMusume,3cfs94,Mreaper300,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:42:11 2015 UTC,I just hope they don't introduce Papi and centorea in one episode. Each character deserves their own introduction episode.

As for the animation, kind of hit or miss for me. The whole wedding setup kind bother me since it really gives of the wrong impression for the series.

MonsterMusume,3cgmph,Miia-san,2,Tue Jul 7 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"The problem with sentai is that its 50/50 with if they do a dub for an anime.  Sometimes, they just release the anime with subtitles.  At least, its certain that were getting an American dvd/blu ray release.  If it does get a dub, I will be happy.  Though I will say that FUNimation completely dropped the ball with noe getting this anime.  Knowing how many fanservice animes they get, you would think they would get Monster Musume."
MonsterMusume,3cgmph,caseyastevens,2,Tue Jul 7 20:44:57 2015 UTC,"at least, its certain that were getting an American dvd/blu ray release.   yup one thing though to also keep in mind, sentai usually never does LE box sets. So if you're a collector like me, stick with the japanese import. (I've waited for a couple of animes for them to release a LE set and they never did) just said fuck it and imported it.   Though I will say that FUNimation completely dropped the ball with noe getting this anime.   Ugh, old funimation was good AF. But holy hell. I swear their dubs are just getting worse and worse these days.    Knowing how many fanservice animes they get, you would think they would get Monster Musume.   Eh, true. But I think sentai would treat monster musume with the care it highly deserves. With over 1,000,000 fans you know that they'll try to rack in the dough with all the merch :D"
MonsterMusume,3cgmph,Miia-san,0,Tue Jul 7 20:47:39 2015 UTC,Funimation still makes great dubs today imo.
MonsterMusume,3cgmph,caseyastevens,0,Tue Jul 7 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"Highschool DxD dub was shit. Hagnai was alright, but not the greatest. I feel like they just ""dub"" over the characters for english viewers. Sentai actually has ""voice actors"" and not just dubbers. Which is probably why I prefer sentai more. There is a difference between a dubber and a VO.   edit : also please don't down vote me just because of my opinion. I've never have been a huge fan of english dubs. I've only enjoyed 4 or 5 of them."
MonsterMusume,3cgmph,Miia-san,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"I heavily disagree.  People like Todd Haberkorn, Collen Clinkenbeard, and the rest at FUNimation are voice actors.  If your telling me actors like those two don;t do a good job acting, again strongly disagree with you.  Saying there just dubbing over the characters makes no sense, because thats the whole point of dubbing."
MonsterMusume,3cgmph,caseyastevens,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"Todd Haberkorn   one of my all time favourite dubbers. loved him as natsu on fairy tail :D    and the rest at FUNimation are voice actors. If your telling me actors like those two don;t do a good job acting, again strongly disagree with you.   No, the difference between a voice actor and a dubber is.  Voice actor = (When the person tries to mimic the original sounding role.) Good example of voice acting <--- only video that came to mind, because I'm learning japanese atm (and a japanese friend recommended I watch this)   Dubbing = When you just talk over the original character. Most english dubs (actually are dubs) there are very few ""dubs"" that actually try to mimic the original. (which is one of the reasons I can't stand english dubs)   edit : Todd is actually a dubber, and he'll admit it himself he's a dubber (he knows the difference) People like steve blum as well (again, dubber) just because he's done popular stuff like batman Arkham and call of duty (doesn't qualify him as a voice actor in anime) yes he's considered a voice actor in cartoons and games. But not when it comes to anime."
MonsterMusume,3cgmph,Miia-san,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"With that being said, woudn't the people at Sentai be also considered dubbers as well, and not voice actors.  Cause they also dub over the original voices. Speaking of Todd, Fairy Tail is probably my favorite dub FUNimation has done. Also I don't know what you mean by mimic the original.  Do you mean translation wise or English voices."
MonsterMusume,3cgmph,caseyastevens,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"woudn't the people at Sentai be also considered dubbers as well, and not voice actors   well yes actually. But I was just saying, sometimes the dubbers will actually try to voice act. If I remember correctly I think Steins;Gate was voice acted. Because I recall the english actors sounding similar to the japanese actors (or my memory might be serving me wrong)    Also I don't know what you mean by mimic the original.   That link I provided you will explain. perhaps this one will be better? yes, there are still dubbers. But usually some people will try to voice act so they can try to I guess get better roles in the future?   Harry potter is the only thing that comes to mind when thinking of a fantastic voice acting performance.    Speaking of Todd, Fairy Tail is probably my favorite dub FUNimation has done.    I agree, natsu was much better in the english version than japanese. But I think for me personally my favorite role he's done was rosario vampire (one of the first eechi anime I've watched :P)"

MonsterMusume,3cgmph,JoeyJojos_Wacky_Trip,3,Wed Jul 8 20:52:11 2015 UTC,That's good to know but I wouldn't get too excited until they announce their plans to dub it or not. I'm hoping they do but I've had that hope dashes too many times.

However, keep in mind that Anime isn't just about the art or the story, it's a business. They know if they disappoint their fans with a  ending they disagree with, it's going hurt DVD/Blu-Ray/Manga/Merchandise sells. Basically, they'll shot themselves in the foot.  So, most of the time with Harem series, they leave it open-ended so the fan are somewhat satisfied with it. Just enough so fans will keep buying merchandise of their favorite characters and series while writing their own fan endings."

MonsterMusume,3cg4qj,Miia-san,2,Tue Jul 7 23:09:29 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZmC3QmeAQ  Then I used ffmpeg to trim it.

MonsterMusume,3cg4qj,xSPYXEx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"webm and mp4 are container formats. Did you mean to specify one of the many video codecs that can be used in a mp4 container, the VP8 video codec, or the VP9 video codec?"
MonsterMusume,3cg4qj,Yay295,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:58:24 2015 UTC,"Webm is vp8, isn't it?  Either way, webm in general is way clearer in quality than a gif, which is why I was suggesting to use that instead."

I was expecting that 3 minute video to be the shorts. But all it turned out to be was miia talking about a bunch of annoucements for merchandise? (and fanart? letters it sounded like?)   What shorts OP?

MonsterMusume,3chhja,Ereusfire1,3,Tue Jul 7 23:09:55 2015 UTC,You heard wrong my friend. The uncensored version is not out yet to the public. The only version we have right now is the one that just recently aired. We wont be seeing the uncensored version until the Vol 1 is released.
MonsterMusume,3chhja,Miia-san,3,Tue Jul 7 23:55:42 2015 UTC,"Damn, I was hoping the uncensored version was out. I guess we have another reason to buy as they hit the states. Here's hoping they are quick."
MonsterMusume,3chhja,Reformingsaint,2,Wed Jul 8 00:51:22 2015 UTC,I thought Tokyo MX aired it uncensored? That's what I've heard at least.

MonsterMusume,3chd72,Miia-san,3,Tue Jul 7 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"Anime episode 1 was manga chapters 1 & 2, looks like episode 2 will be chapters 3 & 4. It may be too early to tell but if the trend continues we may be looking at 2 manga chapters per anime episode."
MonsterMusume,3chd72,Wolfenlord,2,Wed Jul 8 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and such a shame that its so censored to hell.   So much censoring going on with papi.  I also wonder if they're gonna censor the popscicle scene (they did it with to love ru) when momo was having the dirty dream with rito. In the PV they didn't censor it, so I'm pretty curious on this. Can't wait till the next ep. Can't wait until next tuesday <3"
MonsterMusume,3chd72,Wolfenlord,2,Wed Jul 8 00:12:46 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that bodily bits would be censored like at the beginning, in the manga they showed nipples when Miia and Kirihito are in bed together, but in the anime she didn't turn her body so much so no nipple was shown. I think (I hope) that the ice cream scene won't get censored, I mean Miia's orgasm wasn't censored so... Who knows."
MonsterMusume,3chd72,chaosfire235,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:16:56 2015 UTC,They better have the Suu/Papi and Suu/Darling boob scenes!
MonsterMusume,3chd72,caseyastevens,2,Wed Jul 8 04:43:51 2015 UTC,They didn't censor the popsicle scene.  The Papi promo showed it.
MonsterMusume,3chd72,Wolfenlord,2,Wed Jul 8 01:49:00 2015 UTC,The Papi promo showed it.   yeah but that was on YouTube. Who knows if they even aired it over in japan. Most likely it will be censored though.
MonsterMusume,3chd72,caseyastevens,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:13:11 2015 UTC,Not all promos make it to the final cut.
MonsterMusume,3chd72,Wolfenlord,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:02:36 2015 UTC,I still don't see why they would cut out the popsicle scene in the episode.  Theres nothing very explicit about it.
MonsterMusume,3chd72,Razeerka,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:11:19 2015 UTC,"Neither do I, like I mentioned earlier, Miia's orgasm from the manga is in the anime. I don't think the popsicle scene will get cut, but I'm just hoping."
MonsterMusume,3chd72,xSPYXEx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair it is being aired on national TV in Japan. It'd be pretty ridiculous if it showed everything that the manga did.  Although I still have no clue how they're going to do that one chapter with Kii, because there aren't a lot of work around to the shit that went down that chapter, and it wouldn't make sense to skip those scenes, because plot holes. And you can't just skip the entire chapter because later they get those herbs from the forest with Kii's permission.  Well, I mean, I guess if they showed Miia orgasm they probably would still include that. Probably just on the same no nipple basis they've based it on so far."
MonsterMusume,3chd72,Wolfenlord,2,Wed Jul 8 05:25:08 2015 UTC,"Also, has it been confirmed for 12 or 24 episodes in the season? Or if it's 2 chapters per episode, probably 15 or something weird."
MonsterMusume,3cfxak,Heartcraft,3,Tue Jul 7 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"I think I might be in trouble when people visit. I'm afraid at this point my whole house will be covered in miia merch.   also  ""￥6,800"" for just one vol? I'm afraid that a limited edition set is going to be ￥50,000."
MonsterMusume,3cfxak,Miia-san,2,Tue Jul 7 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"I think volumes refer to the manga, which means in total it should cost about ￥6400 (Volume 8 will be out by then)."
MonsterMusume,3cfxak,Miia-san,2,Tue Jul 7 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"I think volumes refer to the manga   no actually, if you're familiar with importing anime. This is quite common. Usually Volumes have 3 to 6 episodes (and come in 4 parts) Dears, Highschool DxD and The world god only knows all did this.   I think I should probably wait for the LE box set."
MonsterMusume,3ch9r2,Miia-san,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:11:48 2015 UTC,Not yet. Just the usual stuff on MM's website for now.  I'm sure they'll make them soon enough. Or people will make bootlegs ones if they don't make official ones.
MonsterMusume,3cda7f,Miia-san,6,Tue Jul 7 00:39:40 2015 UTC,I'm sad because I know I'll have to wait at least two or three episodes for Rachnee to show up.  But it'll be so worth it

They are like this: https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail/detail.php?product_id=40793  However, since you love Miia so much, maybe you'd like this special edition Volume 4: https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail/detail.php?product_id=44001  Have you checked out monmusu.jp to see their LE goods?  P.S. It's almost 1am over here, so I'll reply after work today. Gnight!"

Actually I have not, I wasn't even aware of monmusu.jp only monmusu.tv whoops.  edit : the fuck? only 700 Yen for the LE miia? I paid like 40 pounds for it off of yahoo auctions. Fuck my life.   edit 2 : and I also have the limited edition volume 7 (big melons edition with cerea on the cover)"
MonsterMusume,3cb8so,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:52:27 2015 UTC,"Say, Did the limited edition for Volume 7 come with the LE Card or Poster like the Miia picture you scanned for us?"
MonsterMusume,3cb8so,Miia-san,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"Say, Did the limited edition for Volume 7 come with the LE Card or Poster   it was suppose to, but the seller decided to be an asshole, and sell it seperately for (25 pounds) I'm not paying 25 pounds for a sheet of paper. Fuck for that, I import vol 7 cheaper than that (I just found out from another user I can buy it for 700 yen) with shipping I could probably buy it again for around 15 pounds."
MonsterMusume,3cb8so,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, Yeah, Fuck that guy! XD  Odd question: When you imported LE volumes 4 and 7, Can you actually read them? Or did you get them just for your already impressive MM collection?"
MonsterMusume,3cb8so,Miia-san,2,Mon Jul 6 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"Or did you get them just for your already impressive MM collection?   ^ This. If I want to read it I'll read the english version. I only bought it for miia (because figurines aren't available, so it was the best thing at the time :p)"
MonsterMusume,3cb8so,Miia-san,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:18:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, that card looks pretty sweet! With that kind of luck, it's like you were meant to have it.   Yeah, that's a pretty steep price... sorry :/  Did you buy the LE V7 from an auction or ebay? Just curious; I would love to compare prices.  P.S. When and how did you first come to feel that Miia was best girl?"

MonsterMusume,3cc92j,Miia-san,3,Mon Jul 6 23:50:53 2015 UTC,Yeah but you're not allowed to. Smh Mrs Smith is going to have a word with you.  Plus Suu is the vacuum.

Plus, I'm sure that marriage between human and extraspecies is a long and lengthy legal matter that needs lawyers and stuff to make sure everyone is happy or something. Do you think you can contain yourself long enough to make it all the way through the process without getting her deported?"

I wonder how long this game is going to be around. Because honestly I might register for an account and have one of my japanese friends translate it for me, since I'm a bit newer.   edit : also its not really a game ""per se"" Its almost something like zork. (Where you just read the dialouge) and then give your honest answer and try to progress with the girls.

MonsterMusume,3c98ji,AmiiboPuff,2,Mon Jul 6 17:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would imagine, but its a difficult mini game according to some users. Some times you can answer wrong and then you'll fuck up and have to retrace your steps back to like 4 previous questions and redo the whole scenario. But to be fair, its a dating sims (mostly noobs are trying to play lol) not that I'm saying I'm any better. I'm far worse in fact. I'm awful at dating sims.

Thank god for crunchyroll and their professional translators.   edit : Just realised I canceled my crunchyroll subscription for GameFly. I need to cancel my GameFly Subscription so I can start watching/enjoying anime again. I haven't watched an anime since Naruto Shippunden (naruto nearly killed anime for me, not in a bad way. Just because it was so fucking long and I rushed the series.) I did like 5 episodes a day for several days a week (which is a bit too much and it burnt me out on anime)   Hmm, I really need to get into anime again.   edit 2 : just actually read the page, it seems they're getting to love ru darkness 2. Yes! I can't wait for this summer!    Everyday Life with Monster Girls starts on July 7 at 9:30am Pacific Time, with new episodes to debut every Tuesday   Wooo, another thing to look forward to. every tuesday instead of every god damn saturday. I absolutely hated waiting for the next episode of SAO II earlier this year. Drove me nuts wanting to know what the hell kirito was going to do to death gun next week. But Monster Musume I can watch the same episode twice in a week (just to refresh the memory since it sucks) once on tuesday, and again on saturday (then get to watch the new episode on tuesday :)   edit 3 : wow, crunchyroll supports dubs now? Hmm, really hoping they can get a good dub for monster musume later next year. Although I prefer subs, I'm not a fan of reading and watching anime its a bit distracting."
MonsterMusume,3c4o85,Miia-san,3,Sat Jul 4 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'd just use kissanime or animeshow for higher quality streams, or just torrent from nyaa / horriblesubs."

MonsterMusume,3c4o85,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:10:02 2015 UTC,But its pirating tho. I'd rather pay and stream than pirate.   edit : well there is the option of ads on crunchyroll (you still get it for free legally) but you're limited to 480p I think. Premium is 720p HD and 1080p GLORIOUS HD. But you also can't watch some titles like naruto or bleach in the free version some you can only get in premium. I'll be getting premium so I can get 1080p screencaps and share them with the community. WE NEED MOAR WALLPAPERS.

MonsterMusume,3c4o85,JustiniZHere,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the article says so. As long as you're in one of the areas listed (and probably have premium) you should be okay.  I think if you open the page while it just gets released gives you temporarily access to premium only simulcasts. At least that's what I did for SAO II."
MonsterMusume,3c4o85,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I was think more of the general/main page they have for every series. You know, the one that lists all the episodes that you can pick from then start with.  And that's good to know, I'm not to familiar with CR as I usually just wait a couple of weeks and then binge a series. But I think I'll be signing up just for MM."
MonsterMusume,3c4o85,AmiiboPuff,3,Sat Jul 4 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of just watching it after it has been released and wait a week.

They still go (Month), (day) (year). Only in europe do we go, it's the 7th of july in (of) 2015 ect."

MonsterMusume,3c0guw,Heartcraft,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Woah, is this a recent pic? Do you mind sharing the name of the store with me please?"
MonsterMusume,3c1f91,SeattleLMP,3,Fri Jul 3 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"Life, uh, finds a way.  Since we've never actually seen it, I would bet Miia has a cloaca like other snakes. Maybe that's why Darling doesn't want to get with her. She shits out the fuck hole.  Papi probably doesn't have a hard time cleaning herself, she's just like a kid where she'll run around and get dirty and not want to clean herself. She probably smells like bird. And I bet she eats her own body weight every day as well.  Centorea probably has more control over herself than an animal does.  I don't think Miia has pits so I don't think she could see heat in the same way real snakes would.  Rachnee probably would if you used it as a gag :3"
MonsterMusume,3c1f91,xSPYXEx,3,Fri Jul 3 23:03:05 2015 UTC,"Miia's mom has ""pit vision"", so I think it's safe to assume she does as well. Source: ch27 pg22 http://i.imgur.com/R4HzrfE.png    Centorea's cleaning is addressed in an issue, though I don't remember which, where she says she has a brush with a long handle to reach. Allthough Kunanzuki Ren remarks that her room still smells like a barn."

MonsterMusume,3c1f91,Miia-san,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:41:01 2015 UTC,"cloaca    heh, relevant"
MonsterMusume,3c1f91,xSPYXEx,0,Sat Jul 4 02:08:13 2015 UTC,"I doubt Miia's got a cloaca, cause then Papi would have one too. And there was that whole chapter where Papi laid the egg and other various chapters where there have been some rather vivid details in regards to Papi's vulva. But then that just raises more questions about Papi's digestive system (And reproductive). Human-Animal Hybrids would be a fucking mess in the real world."
MonsterMusume,3c1f91,xSPYXEx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"Well, Papi is less bird than Miia is snake. Papi's arms and legs are bird, while Miia's entire lower half is snake. Plus the cloaca would be on the snake half, while Papi's would be on the human part."
MonsterMusume,3c1f91,xSPYXEx,0,Sat Jul 4 00:05:03 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it is an equal 50/50 between human and animal. Like, Papi's outer looks are Bird arms and legs with human body. But her skeletal structure and internal organs would have to have bird like origins if she hoped to get off the ground. She would almost assuredly have a unidirectional respiratory system to survive high altitude flight."
MonsterMusume,3c1f91,AmiiboPuff,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:13:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's really a hard limit on how human/monster they are. Like Mero, who would be more fish than human because not only is her entire lower half fish but she'd also have gills and lungs that can filter water selectively."

MonsterMusume,3bm147,Miia-san,0,Tue Jun 30 13:19:51 2015 UTC,"I kinda hope it does get picked up by funimation, BUT. Only because if it does. That gives it a higher chance for it to get dubbed. (Although I don't want it dubbed) (for me personally) but, dubbed anime = available to purchase in the us. (edit : You can also still watched subtitled/japanese language on the english dvd)   Its very rare when anime's get dubbed if they're picked up by crunchyroll. (Which is one of the reasons why you never see english dubbed anime's on crunchyroll, not dubs in general I mean titles like heaven's lost property, rosario vampire ect.)   If funimation is smart they'll try to get it based off of its popularity. But then again, I kind of hope they don't get it because they have been fucking up a lot lately with dubs. I got super exited for Highschool DxD's official dub. But god damn, all the characters sounded like shit. I just stuck to the subtitled version."

MonsterMusume,3b8huu,Felasser,2,Sat Jun 27 01:56:49 2015 UTC,Then what kind of OC are you looking for? OC stands for (Original Content) are you looking for something more like a doujin or something? Even if its a different character cosplaying as a different character it still qualifies as OC.   edit : just realized you weren't OP. But still it still counts as OC.
MonsterMusume,3b8huu,TheOneMavado,2,Sat Jun 27 02:21:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, I was thinking of fan characters. I have no clue why the term ""OC"" is associated with fan characters, but I just go along with it."
MonsterMusume,3b8huu,Miia-san,5,Sat Jun 27 02:33:26 2015 UTC,"OC is usually meant to stand for ""Original Character"" for discussion on sites like Devinart and 4chan. Since most people wouldn't be bother to learn about someone's fanmade character's names, comments tend to break to...""LOL Nice OC."" or ""Such a mary sue OC."""

My guess, sometime after the screening at Odaiba Cinema Mediage on the 27th, we'll get more info on who's getting MM."

MonsterMusume,3b30hl,xSPYXEx,2,Thu Jun 25 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the manga wasn't really subtle about it either.  Pretty sure he even had an audience muttering about what he was doing."

MonsterMusume,3b30hl,xSPYXEx,2,Thu Jun 25 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"it won't be. I mean I think the popscicle scene in to love ru might have been censored (but the ""cum""/cream) wasn't. But to be fair, Monster Musume airs at midnight (around the adult/eechi timeslots)   usually it only gets censored if it shows nipples. They usually will air nearly anything else. But the nipples."

Nobody even talks about them on 4chan and it seems like 4chan has almost all of the rare monster musume stuff when it comes to merch.   I would also love to know if someone has an answer.

MonsterMusume,3azqd7,DeathKidFTW,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"You said they are officially releasing them? Does that mean a future release, maybe to promote the show?"
MonsterMusume,3azqd7,DeathKidFTW,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:37:57 2015 UTC,I never said officially releasing them but it doesn't mean they won't release them either. Usually big anime companies release trading card sets along with huge shows (Highschool DxD did this) and the trading card set expanded into like 5 - 6 different sets and they're all very rare/hard to find (even official cards) you can find scans of them on rule34 but that's about it.

Looks like there's an open spot on their page though, so she might appear later."
MonsterMusume,3amh37,Juan3000333,2,Mon Jun 22 08:17:19 2015 UTC,"I think your about spot on.   I haven't added Smith and Kimihito because there icon on http://monmusu.tv/character/ just  don't look as good. It looks like they just used screen grabs for them, while the others are higher quality production art."
MonsterMusume,3amh37,Miia-san,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:19:19 2015 UTC,Really? I think kimihito would look great on the banner. Is it because of the pixels or because it doesn't look as smooth as the other girls? I don't think you should add mrs.smith but I definitely think you should add kimihito back on the banner again. I'll see if I can whip something up in photoshop when I get some freetime.

MonsterMusume,39lz14,letfireraindown,2,Fri Jun 12 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"I try the same thing on /a/anime and i think that will fail hard soon... but I try to not be offensive.  I mean, i enjoyed making dead baby joikes, but seriously we were all teenagers at a time."
MonsterMusume,39lz14,MisterFiend,4,Sat Jun 13 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am literally too old for that shit."
MonsterMusume,39lz14,uuuuuuuuh,4,Sat Jun 13 02:28:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure it's fair to compare us to other fandoms (to the other fandoms). Here on reddit we're only 700 strong with /u/miia-san taking up the whole front page. We just don't have the numbers to pick up closed-minded/overly dramatic people that other subs/fandoms might.
MonsterMusume,39lz14,Miia-san,4,Sat Jun 13 10:18:39 2015 UTC,"Here on reddit we're only 700 strong with /u/miia-san taking up the whole front page.   hey, you say that like its a bad thing, its not my fault I'm one of the few who actually publish content on this sub-reddit :p Its almost mind blowing how we have 700 subscribers, and over 600 are usually pretty active, yet we don't see hardly any new OC or just favorite moments/fanart.   I know that we have 600+ active subscribers because on the imgur view page on my profile a lot of the traffic is coming from /r/monstermusume subscribers, and probably around 50 redditors just browsing the page out of curiosity."
MonsterMusume,39lz14,letfireraindown,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:57:40 2015 UTC,"Um... Dumb question... as i like most of the content on my subs... does that report button/link do nothing?  That aside, i would think anyone who cares would look at Papi odd, annoying as that is.  Papi is second best to Suu!"
MonsterMusume,39lz14,Juan3000333,2,Sat Jun 13 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"The report button sends a note to mods about a given link. It's up to the mods to take something down if it is found to be inappropriate.   Secondly, I agree. Suu is best girl."
MonsterMusume,39lwfw,Miia-san,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:31:35 2015 UTC,Wait until the Anime is released then we'll get flooded even more.
MonsterMusume,39lwfw,Reformingsaint,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:42:44 2015 UTC,Yup which is probably where some of that 100 subs came from :p most likely came from the PV.
MonsterMusume,39lwfw,Reformingsaint,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:45:01 2015 UTC,Here's hoping we get a lot more. Do you know if any sub group has already claimed the Anime yet?
MonsterMusume,39lwfw,Juan3000333,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:46:07 2015 UTC,you know if any sub group has already claimed the Anime yet?   I actually made a /r/monstermusumeanime sub-reddit a while back but it was a bad idea at the time :/
MonsterMusume,39lwfw,Juan3000333,2,Fri Jun 12 17:47:11 2015 UTC,"If you really wanted to, you could put in a request over on /r/redditrequest and have them redirect your sub-reddits to us.   I have full intentions off keeping /r/MonsterMusume updated on the news for the anime and manga."
MonsterMusume,39lwfw,Reformingsaint,2,Fri Jun 12 17:59:21 2015 UTC,"Nah might as well just leave them alone, after all we don't want to split up the fans into different sub-reddits. A lot of our subscribers are most likely from /r/monstergirls and subscribed because they're a fan of the series. So we should try to keep it all in one place instead of having multiple sub-reddits. imho its not a bad idea to do it with the girls, so the girl fandoms can come together and chat/post pictures of the same girl in one place that's fine. But we should keep the manga/anime stuff related in here."
MonsterMusume,39lwfw,The1andonlygogoman64,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:14:24 2015 UTC,Agreed
MonsterMusume,39geam,Miia-san,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:26:12 2015 UTC,I also have the limited edition volume 4 artwork (its behind the cover as of right now) but I plan on getting a second frame this weekend to hang both of them up :D
MonsterMusume,39geam,DPPDivine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:26:50 2015 UTC,That's pretty sweet! Where did you get the limited edition artwork?
MonsterMusume,39geam,IIDannyBoyII,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:16:20 2015 UTC,"I bought volume 4 limited edition from Yahoo Auctions Japan and imported it. It was around 8,500 yen. (not including taxes/shipping charges) if you want you can print out this scan But I haven't gotten the chance to scan the censored version (which I find more sexier than the uncensored version)"
MonsterMusume,39geam,IIDannyBoyII,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:21:58 2015 UTC,do u have the pic like that online that is censored i think it looks better than the uncensored one
MonsterMusume,39gbm0,Miia-san,2,Thu Jun 11 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"If anyone is wanting to know how I came across the card.  I was in a locale used bookstore here in the UK and came across Monster Musume Volume 1 used for $50. I asked the guy ""why on earth is this $50?"" he replied saying ""because its bundled with a limited edition card""   I can't believe my luck today! I was just recently posting on here where I can find these cards because I just recently learned about them and just found one! and its of miia <3  I did see some going on ebay for $250 (for 3 fucking cards) and $250 is not worth it. Even if it is mero, and rachnera <3   But I can't believe my joy/excitement right now. I'm just mindblown that they had this. On the journey to find the entire collection now! :D   as requested <--- image of the back of the card + book.   edit : yes the book is in english and the card is in japanese (don't know why it was bundled like that) I guess the previous owner of the card just wanted it gone? Ah, just too happy to have some more miia merchandise <3   edit 2 : does anyone happen to still know how to get these cards? I seriously want to collect the whole set. I'm also wondering if there are hologram versions of all the cards or if there are some hologram/non-hologram. The set on eBay going for $250 was hologram."
MonsterMusume,39gbm0,BladeLigerV,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:12:32 2015 UTC,That poor poor fool lost his card.
MonsterMusume,39cvev,Miia-san,3,Wed Jun 10 22:27:01 2015 UTC,"Imho, this chapter just got funnier and funnier yet still remained sexy :P   honestly, volume 2 is probably my favourite volume."
MonsterMusume,397l30,Miia-san,5,Tue Jun 9 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"It seems I have deleted the original post on accident a while back :(  I'll take some pictures for newcomers in a while!   edit : here, ya go new users!"
MonsterMusume,397n5c,Miia-san,2,Tue Jun 9 21:04:38 2015 UTC,Thats my favorite shot from the PV
MonsterMusume,397n5c,SecretKarmaSerenade,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:01:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. She's cute just going down the road smiling and dancing because shes on her date :p
MonsterMusume,391fu8,Miia-san,2,Mon Jun 8 15:36:50 2015 UTC,"Does anyone happen to know who the girl on the front is? I haven't seen her before, everything on the cover looks pretty awesome except for suu and rachnera. They seemed like they were a little rushed. But imho this is some fucking awesome fanart."
MonsterMusume,391fu8,TheOneMavado,5,Mon Jun 8 15:37:50 2015 UTC,You mean Papi?
MonsterMusume,391fu8,ns41,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:13:34 2015 UTC,That's papi? That looks nothing like papi. lol.
MonsterMusume,391gkm,Miia-san,2,Mon Jun 8 15:41:45 2015 UTC,Source. now go bug him to do best girl rachnee
MonsterMusume,391gkm,The1andonlygogoman64,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:20:19 2015 UTC,This. I'm more of a fan now.
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,Miia-san,3,Sun Jun 7 20:35:16 2015 UTC,It'd be cool to see the others basically 'humanized' for lack of a better word. More so since I'm curious what they'd look like.
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,chaosfire235,2,Mon Jun 8 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine Rachnera or Tio as anything surprising except tall.  Both of them have overbearing personalities and it would be a shame to have weakened without their stature.  On the other hand, Manako would just have two eyes, so not very different."
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,letfireraindown,6,Wed Jun 10 22:25:37 2015 UTC,I'll take regular ol' non-legged Miia if that's alright.
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,Dutchdude_kinks,2,Sun Jun 7 21:06:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, she looks too weird with legs."
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,monteith19,8,Sun Jun 7 21:09:25 2015 UTC,i think she looks good with legs
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,letfireraindown,5,Sun Jun 7 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"imho, she looks alright with them. But I'm way too use to her tail :/  so it looks a little weird to me."
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,TeoZakeru,3,Sun Jun 7 21:33:21 2015 UTC,I can just imagine her cooking in the kitchen after such a change.  she fails to realize everything that's different and reaches to grab something with her tail.  One of her legs twitches...
MonsterMusume,38y1sw,styckly,3,Wed Jun 10 22:16:49 2015 UTC,"She's still cute, even with human legs."
MonsterMusume,38t0tt,HipsterBird,2,Sat Jun 6 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"thank you for adding that picture in the upper right of mero, I just thought that scene was hilarious."
MonsterMusume,38t0tt,Miia-san,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"I made all of these pictures aside from Centorea's, which was posted on the sub by /u/miia-san a couple days ago. Any other girls I tried to make these for just didn't have enough pictures so they wouldn't come out as good. I hope you enjoy the ones I did make!"
MonsterMusume,38t0tt,rundelhaus,2,Sat Jun 6 15:54:21 2015 UTC,Can you send me a template?
MonsterMusume,38t0tt,rundelhaus,2,Sun Jun 7 13:25:34 2015 UTC,Here you go!
MonsterMusume,38syob,Miia-san,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:33:36 2015 UTC,Papi is my all time favorite character. I absolutely love her to death.
MonsterMusume,38t970,Miia-san,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"It seems that the east coast in the us is the largest fan community inside of the US. Outside of US it seems that Europe is the second largest. (but this is just according to the /r/monstermusume poll) not based off of a real poll. Just a fan poll. if this was the real deal, then I'm 90% sure that Japan would hit second. Because although it is indeed popular in japan. The US has sold more copies every issue than in japan. I dunno about Europe though. I haven't seen any stats for europe :("
MonsterMusume,38t970,TheOneMavado,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any stats for europe :(   Well, I did hear that it's being published in Germany, but that seems to be pretty much it. I just import the volumes from the US myself, so my purchases would probably count towards the US sales."
MonsterMusume,38op7y,HipsterBird,2,Fri Jun 5 16:18:56 2015 UTC,You should remove the monster girl thread in the upper left corner. Other than that this is amazing <3  edit : OP also 1920 x 1080p not 1400x1000 D:   edit 2 : removed the mgt OP can you just resize the image? I'd love to make this apart of my wallpaper set.
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,3,Fri Jun 5 18:11:36 2015 UTC,Don't worry OP delivers
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,2,Fri Jun 5 18:50:05 2015 UTC,great work! :D
MonsterMusume,38op7y,rundelhaus,2,Fri Jun 5 19:12:34 2015 UTC,Is there a generator for these kinds of things? I know it's from simpsons but is there an automated way to make it?
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,2,Fri Jun 5 19:42:51 2015 UTC,No you'd have to download the .psd (Photoshop) template.
MonsterMusume,38op7y,rundelhaus,2,Fri Jun 5 19:50:09 2015 UTC,Do you have the link?
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,3,Fri Jun 5 19:52:30 2015 UTC,http://k33.kn3.net/taringa/2/3/1/0/1/0/25/julian_6464/324.jpg  although you have to manually re-size it in photoshop.
MonsterMusume,38op7y,rundelhaus,3,Fri Jun 5 20:02:59 2015 UTC,It gives me a 403 Forbidden error
MonsterMusume,38op7y,The1andonlygogoman64,2,Fri Jun 5 20:05:36 2015 UTC,Same. 403 forbidden. Could you imgur rehost it?
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,2,Fri Jun 5 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"sure, just give me a few minutes. I'll do it as soon as I get home."
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"Also, I noticed the top left picture is clipping strangely. I fixed it here!  Edit: If anyone wants more of these, I'm thinking of making it for all the girls."
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,2,Fri Jun 5 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"Edit: If anyone wants more of these, I'm thinking of making it for all the girls.   you should. it'd save a lot of time for who ever else was planning on doing it. Although you shouldn't have to worry about making a centorea one. And I dunno about the mero one either. Mero might be hard to make considering she doesn't get a lot of screentime."
MonsterMusume,38op7y,Miia-san,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:47:11 2015 UTC,"As of right now, I just finished the Miia and Papi ones and I'm working on Mero's now. I'll probably just make a big album of all of the girls and post them when I finish."
MonsterMusume,38nyla,MrTheJackThePerson,3,Fri Jun 5 13:14:09 2015 UTC,Can my wallet handle it? Not really. But food isn't that important anyways.
MonsterMusume,38nyla,MageCym,2,Fri Jun 5 23:01:20 2015 UTC,"Nope wallet is too occupied with steam sales right now. </3 just recently hit 1,000 titles on steam and going to try to knock off the rest of my wishlist this summer. Hopefully though next month I can start saving up again for figurines :D   Can't wait to get a figurine of one of each cast member."
MonsterMusume,38nyla,Miia-san,3,Fri Jun 5 15:04:24 2015 UTC,Can't wait to get a figurine of one of each cast member.  one of each cast member.   Mr or Mrs Moneybags over here.
MonsterMusume,38nyla,Miia-san,2,Fri Jun 5 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"Mr, and I'm not rich. I just save up my money through out the months. I only make like $300 a week. (luckily for me I live with a room-mate) so I can blow all my money after I split the bill :-) It'll probably take me a good month or so to get each figurine (depending on how much they are)   edit : oh I think you must have miss understood when I mentioned the 1,000 games on steam as well. (they're mostly humble bundle titles) I can get like 100 games for around $40+ :D"
MonsterMusume,38nyla,Miia-san,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, I was referring to getting one of each member. I guess it depends on what brands will be releasing, but even if they're Nendoroids... they'll probably be about $50 a pop since they'd be more intricate than just regular body plus design stuff. That's around $300 if we're just talking about the main cast."
MonsterMusume,38nyla,TeoZakeru,2,Fri Jun 5 15:59:24 2015 UTC,Nendoroids     to be completely honest I hate Nendoroids. I think some of the marel ones are kind of cool to have. But just some of them are just either creepy or weird imho. I was thinking about picking a /r/soranootoshimono one but it was just too weird. I'd rather stick with figurines based off the actual character.   Normal figurines aren't usually too bad. Usually they run around anywhere between $100 or $300 ($500 if limited edition) if they're $100 each then I should be able to get one of each of the cast member. But if they wind up being like $300. I'll only be able to get one a month :/
MonsterMusume,38nyla,monteith19,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really helps that you only have to pay half the bill I suppose. I like Nendoroids, but if I have enough cash that I can spring for something better, I do. Not to mention they do a lot of Male Nendoroids that I haven't seen other figures for (the main one being Koyomi Araragi from Monogatari)"
MonsterMusume,38nyla,TheOneMavado,2,Fri Jun 5 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"I just want my blu-rays of Miia being cute. Should get me a BD player anyway, since there is a ton of anime I need to get."
MonsterMusume,38nyla,letfireraindown,3,Fri Jun 5 16:34:10 2015 UTC,Just get a ps3/4. You get your Blu-ray player and then you can get Persona 5 when it comes out! :)
