Earwolf,3e1car,Qoth,19,Tue Jul 21 05:02:52 2015 UTC,"Bummer but not a bummer; Tig was barely into it any more, which was audibly apparent (what?) over the last few months. Totally understandable given whats going on in her personal and professional life that a zero-pay podcast that is about nothing, really, fell by the wayside."
Earwolf,3e1car,olenine,15,Tue Jul 21 11:35:36 2015 UTC,"They aren't zero pay podcasts.  Hosts at earwolf do make money off their shows.  But still, it wouldn't be nearly the same as TV/movies/live act money.  So your point still stands!"
Earwolf,3e1car,CrouchJr,5,Tue Jul 21 12:29:19 2015 UTC,"Still, you'd hope she'd still be interested in spending time with her buddies."
Earwolf,3e1car,Teenageboy69,8,Tue Jul 21 14:28:52 2015 UTC,She will.  But just not on a regularly scheduled podcast.  I don't think they're calling off their friendship.
Earwolf,3e1car,CrouchJr,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"Thats right. I mean, imagine having to commit to a weekly podcast, often when the three members are in different parts of the states. Huge ask."
Earwolf,3e1car,shadoire,5,Tue Jul 21 23:03:16 2015 UTC,"No, I just meant showing enthusiasm when she was with them. You would think that no matter how side tracked she was the last few months she'd show some enthusiasm and perk up when she was with those two. I'm sure they'll still be friends afterwards."
Earwolf,3e1car,Teenageboy69,36,Tue Jul 21 15:22:15 2015 UTC,Who's Oliver Sidepodcasts?   (Sorry)

Earwolf,3e1car,PDCchewie88,3,Tue Jul 21 17:46:30 2015 UTC,He should bring Wife along too
Earwolf,3e1car,or_me_bender,11,Wed Jul 22 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats to Professor Blastoff for an incredible run. PBO was one of the first pods I got into and introduced me to a ton of awesome comics and bits. Glad to hear Kyle is going to keep putting out content."
Earwolf,3e1car,Slayner,10,Tue Jul 21 14:33:59 2015 UTC,"Sad news, but honestly it's probably for the best for the three of them. Tig has been too busy and lost interest in that show months ago. David has always wanted the show to dive into the deeper discussions a bit, and now he has Reactor.   And if Kyle will be doing his own podcast he can get more silly without trying to mask it with the central theme of Professor Blastoff.   I'm upset, because I loved this podcast, but it makes sense and to be honest I think we all saw it coming.  Definitely can't wait to hear Kyle's podcast though"
Earwolf,3e1car,tkdgns,11,Tue Jul 21 12:53:55 2015 UTC,"Welp, that's been podcast."
Earwolf,3e1car,Teenageboy69,9,Tue Jul 21 21:24:45 2015 UTC,I'm really bummed we didn't get a farewell episode.
Earwolf,3e1car,GilliMarshall,8,Tue Jul 21 14:29:41 2015 UTC,"We get one, it just isn't up yet. There's a write-up on their website."
Earwolf,3e1car,shadoire,7,Tue Jul 21 15:04:42 2015 UTC,"This is a bummer to read, but it makes sense. It should be interesting to see if Kyle's new one is on Earwolf (I would assume it would be but I don't know how these things work)"
Earwolf,3e1car,sharkjack,3,Tue Jul 21 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"I really hope it is. And if so, we all need to make sure the rest of this sub get in on the ground floor."
Earwolf,3e1car,samantha-mulder,7,Tue Jul 21 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"this is one the only 2 podcasts that I wake up early to hear as soon as possible. So long, Tiny Calves, Beach Poop, and The Wig."
Earwolf,3e1car,shadoire,8,Tue Jul 21 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"I mean damn, she had a blastronaut offer to carry her baby and she can't even be bothered to let the fans know herself? Still love Tig forever but....damn."
Earwolf,3e1car,Pezzatron,3,Tue Jul 21 20:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. I think her love of the cast and everything associated died a long time ago. However, they might have a farewell podcast. So we should wait to see how that goes."
Earwolf,3e1car,catglass,13,Tue Jul 21 23:05:24 2015 UTC,I'm very happy about this to be honest. Kyle was pretty much the only reason I was tuning in toward the end
Earwolf,3e1car,PDCchewie88,3,Tue Jul 21 09:23:48 2015 UTC,"It feels kind of bad to say, but I agree."
Earwolf,3e1car,Blanq_Winq,13,Tue Jul 21 19:13:19 2015 UTC,"It had a good run, lots of fun bits, but it's definitely been time to close up the hatch for a while now. I'd rather have no Professor Blastoff than a half-hearted Professor Blastoff.   It's a shame, I thought that last week's Tig-less episode was actually pretty interesting and informative and kind of a return to form for the show. Oh well, so it goes. I won't really lament having one less podcast in my already crowded listening rotation for a while though."
Earwolf,3e1car,RedFrogMario,6,Tue Jul 21 13:44:52 2015 UTC,Can't say I didn't see this coming but I too hoped they'd have a farewell episode :/

Earwolf,3e1car,siriusthinking,6,Tue Jul 21 14:40:08 2015 UTC,"Aw, PB was one of the first podcasts I listened to and has been one of my favorites the last few years. You really get the sense this was inevitable though. The tone of the show shifted a while ago. They have an official statement on their site and it sounds like there is a last episode called New Beginnings, but it isn't on Earwolf yet."
Earwolf,3e1car,peon_taking_credit,6,Tue Jul 21 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"OH NO!!  =(  I am totally into Kyle having his own show, but I love Blastoff.  I was hoping they'd get back into it more."
Earwolf,3e1car,shadoire,7,Tue Jul 21 15:56:11 2015 UTC,This has nothing to do with Tig or David. Kyle is gonna ride his posedown to the stars and beyond and no one can stop him.
Earwolf,3e1car,KajusX,6,Tue Jul 21 19:02:53 2015 UTC,Sad news. I just hope david and kyle stick together...

Earwolf,3e1car,shadoire,4,Tue Jul 21 06:45:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly this status could very much just mean Tig is officially leaving, the show might still continue without her."
Earwolf,3e1car,PDCchewie88,8,Tue Jul 21 09:55:21 2015 UTC,"True,  but the way Kyle mentions that he's bringing all his characters/bits with him and asks the group to not disband makes it seem like PB is a goner...."
Earwolf,3e1car,sourmilksmell,5,Tue Jul 21 14:03:44 2015 UTC,I just hope david stays involved.
Earwolf,3e1car,PDCchewie88,2,Tue Jul 21 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, he always seemed like the one most interested in a lot of the more scientific type topics on the show, which I liked. It almost makes me wish that he would go and join ""Probably Science"" as a co-host, I think he would fit right in with their format."
Earwolf,3e1car,Shampoodler,4,Wed Jul 22 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"After having watched her doc on netflix the other day, it seems like this news makes sense.  I do like the Kyle and David relationship. They released the recent video together, and it was fun."
Earwolf,3e1car,Original_B,3,Tue Jul 21 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yea I feel like she never really mentioned much on PB how much she has been wanting to have kids and start a family, which was kind of a big part of the doc. I really hope for the best for her and that she and Stephanie have a family soon, but that really does add just one more thing in her life that makes the podcast a low priority."
Earwolf,3e1car,catglass,7,Wed Jul 22 00:29:52 2015 UTC,Never listened to this one (full pcast load as it is) but reading the recent comments about it made this seem inevitable/almost welcomed.  Now if we can just convince Nerd Poker to shape up or follow suit! jk (not really)
Earwolf,3e1car,jmg089,3,Tue Jul 21 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"Where will I get ""science"" if not from a podcast with a host who insists that there's no way that humans could have built the pyramids?  What's that? Literally anywhere else? Ok."

Earwolf,3e1ntz,or_me_bender,8,Tue Jul 21 14:30:18 2015 UTC,"This episode got extremely wacky, Sinbad style. I loved it!! I always appreciate them boldly exploring new comic territory. Also happy to see the ep length over an hour.  With arguably the best bit memory in the game, the boys talked about the need to explore the Ocean over Space back in Ep. #047 - Zoe Jarman, Our Close Friend. Either that our they're following along with our relistening."
Earwolf,3e1ntz,nohorseman,7,Tue Jul 21 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"When Walsh immediately started the interview with a bit about how he and Sean used to date, I knew he was going to be great guest. I'd love to see him on more Earwolf shows."

Earwolf,3e1ntz,31081995,6,Tue Jul 21 10:25:50 2015 UTC,So the engineer in the first part was Cody and the second part Ryan? Do they do them on different days ?
Earwolf,3e1ntz,klobbermang,10,Tue Jul 21 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"Sometimes! The interview portion is contingent on a guest's schedule, while the first part they can just do whenever! And since Earwolf is such a happenin' place, I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was difficult to book a studio for the full show length from time to time. Especially with regards to the longer eps."
Earwolf,3e1ntz,sevillianrites,4,Tue Jul 21 14:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty apparent in the Pauly Shore episode where Sean references the later segment before it happens."

I like to think that I still consider them peers and really stay down to earth with them. I did skip my 5-year high-school reunion last November, but that was actually before I appeared on the show at all and it was a scheduling conflict. I really look forward to my 10-year reunion. Perhaps by then I'll better undrestand what this Mercedes popcorn situation is and I can utilize that to make a good impression on those guys.  My favorite memory of high school is when on math team there was a trig question and I didn't know the answer but I guessed (something like 5 \pi / 7 or something obscure) and got it right! Love that memory.  -Tim"

Earwolf,3dzwpk,Zsinjeh,6,Mon Jul 20 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"Hi dixonticonderoga, thanks for your question.  In response to your question, my answer would be that the inside of the Earwolf studios inside is like is really cool, and it's great that fans have such an interest in our Studio.  In particular, there are free stickers for each show that are hanging around. Actually, I don't think they're free. Some of the people with me took them when Cody went to the bathroom. I took one for ADPPP, but I left a few dollars in the sticker's wake, hopefully to compensate Earwolf ;)  Thanks!  -Tim"

I wanted to sign it but I didn't have any writing utensils because we were all doing miming and acting when recording, and without any writing utensils, how do you think I could have signed the table?

Doing this wouldn't feel organic as an i4h ep though"
Earwolf,3dyywn,ChristopheWaltz,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:33 2015 UTC,I dont know if Hayes does improv.
Earwolf,3dyywn,Slayner,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"Right, but neither of their characters can do improv, which I guess is my point. They would constantly need to have Besser explain things to them, and probably break up all the skits."
Earwolf,3dyywn,thejjar,9,Mon Jul 20 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"That's like my dream episode of HH, and I think it'd be great, I just don't know if I'd want that to happen on I4H I think the great thing about I4H is no one person usually is the 'special guest' or has the spotlight, it's a shared group thing.   If Hayes and Sean were doing that it'd kinda steal the thunder from everyone else, and it'd make it just about them."
Earwolf,3dyywn,ChristopheWaltz,11,Mon Jul 20 18:47:43 2015 UTC,Yea it would work better if Besser came on HH and the guys asked him to do improv with them there.  It would be like when they played Riddle Me This with PFT

Earwolf,3dyywn,Slayner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe not career-wise, but much of what he does on HH is improvised, like the ""script reads"""
Earwolf,3dyywn,changry_perdvert,8,Mon Jul 20 18:33:10 2015 UTC,If you notice though he is the one who usually is the narrator though. I mean he clearly can do some improv but it's mostly Sean and the guest who are really doing it.   Not to take away how funny Hayes is or anything
Earwolf,3dyywn,Slayner,3,Mon Jul 20 18:38:17 2015 UTC,Sean does more improv than Hayes but Hayes still does a ton of amazing improv all the time and I think he has become a pretty excellent improvisor.
Earwolf,3dyywn,sevillianrites,6,Mon Jul 20 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"Oh me too, Hayes does great, I would equate him much like Scott Aukerman."
Earwolf,3dyywn,ChristopheWaltz,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah Hayes is more of the guy trying and failing magnificently to be the ""straight man"". They both have completely different comedy personalities that happen to compliment each other perfectly. I've seen a few people say Sean is the funnier of the two, but without Hayes's semi grounded, faux methodical style, I wonder if Sean's abject wackiness would play as well."
Earwolf,3dyywn,Slayner,5,Tue Jul 21 15:33:33 2015 UTC,"But I don't know if Matt would have him on. It seems to be only people who have done 401 at the UCB. The only people who I think haven't were Scott Auckerman (who was on i4h very early on, like the first ten episodes), Maria Bamford (who wasn't great and I think it was obvious that Matt agreed) and Todd Glass (who was really only on to debate). I prefer it this way, sticking to one school of improv allows for better scenes in which the performers work together very well. Maybe if they did this as an episode of HH that would be hilarious, maybe with Besser and Walsh or something."
Earwolf,3dyywn,ChristopheWaltz,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:38 2015 UTC,The real only exception to this is he had PFT on.
Earwolf,3dyywn,86themayo,3,Mon Jul 20 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, forgot about PFT. But he's been close to the theatre for many years now, Matt doesn't even know Hayes."
Earwolf,3dyywn,ChristopheWaltz,3,Mon Jul 20 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"He's also had on many improvisers that weren't trained by UCB. Craig Cackowski, Rich Talarico, Bob Dassie, Tim Meadows, Neil Flynn, Scott Adsit. I'm sure there are others."

Earwolf,3dyywn,jononyx,3,Tue Jul 21 11:49:07 2015 UTC,That sounds like it would just be an episode of Hollywood Handbook and not an episode of i4h at all.  Not that it wouldn't be fun...

Earwolf,3dx5u6,sevillianrites,29,Mon Jul 20 07:15:39 2015 UTC,Shame Showalter or Michael Ian Black couldn't be on but still excited to give this a listen.  Wain is one of my favorite Earwolf guests

Earwolf,3dx5u6,gabe1108,21,Mon Jul 20 09:15:30 2015 UTC,About 15 min in already David just keeps reminding me why I have so much fun listening to him just go along with everything. Also a real life baby may be born?? Lol. Edit: Sorry 30 minutes in...lost track of time with this one
Earwolf,3dx5u6,LuxSapphire,19,Mon Jul 20 08:19:54 2015 UTC,When the Would You Rather music started playing I knew they were gonna talk over it. I was not let down by Scott's reaction.
Earwolf,3dx5u6,tppatterson223,18,Mon Jul 20 11:29:33 2015 UTC,"He doesn't do it as often, and will start the game while it's playing sometimes, but Scott forcing the guests to be quiet for the entire theme is one of my favorite bits on the show.   A close second is PFT telling Scott and others to shut up."
Earwolf,3dx5u6,JustSomeGuy222,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"One of, if not, the very first CBBs I listened to had PFT as Cake Boss and they did a ""Jeremy Piven remix"" of the Would You Rather theme.  Just saying Jeremy Piven to the beat.  Oh, and Andy Richter was the guest because I remember he finished up with an off-key ""Rutger Hauuueeerrr"".  It's still my favorite version of the theme."

Earwolf,3dx5u6,Prax150,3,Mon Jul 20 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"What's nuts about her comment is that she was on an episode that had, what, 30 seconds of a character?"
Earwolf,3dx5u6,requisite_monocle,3,Tue Jul 21 03:24:12 2015 UTC,I'd love to see her do a character. God know she had some killer one on Satur- daynight live.
Earwolf,3dx5u6,thecricketnerd,2,Tue Jul 21 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"That's part of why I said it! She seemed to be really down with the whole CBB thing, and was really enjoying herself"

Earwolf,3dx5u6,robbyalaska907420,23,Mon Jul 20 13:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think he just likes poking fun because of Maron's somewhat self-serious comedy style. Scott did seem downright incredulous when Obama  traveled to the cat ranch to guest on WTF.  However, when they've crossed paths on their respective podcasts they seem to get along just fine."
Earwolf,3dx5u6,mikel3030,30,Mon Jul 20 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"I think Scott is just being funny about the Obama thing, as he has literally directed and wrote jokes for Obama in a comedy sketch (between two ferns)"
Earwolf,3dx5u6,ifeellikeimflying,6,Mon Jul 20 14:09:14 2015 UTC,Do you mean Barack Hussein Obamacare?
Earwolf,3dx5u6,Quinez,8,Tue Jul 21 07:19:50 2015 UTC,There's a live WTF from maybe a year and a half ago and Scott is one of the guests. It sounds like they're okay with each other but Scott isn't into being so self-serious about comedy.
Earwolf,3dx5u6,novation123,8,Mon Jul 20 15:15:55 2015 UTC,"And all they did was shit on each other!  It was great.  Mark would ask ""innocuous"" questions like, ""so how's your health?  Have you been working out?"" and Scott would see them for the veiled insults they are and just be all, ""that's what you're gonna ask me?  Fuck you!""  It's just a bit, but it's a great one.  I think they're both legitimately competitive though; there's a grain of truth behind it as in all good comedy."
Earwolf,3dx5u6,Slayner,6,Mon Jul 20 22:59:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, actually, there used to be a good amount of enmity there. Well deserved. Maron used to be a huge asshole (still is, but was worse then). Iirc he made some off the cuff comment on WTF or somewhere about how he didn't respect Scott because Scott was a hack who ""hid"" behind his comedy and was afraid of letting his interviews get serious.  I'm sure there was more below the surface, but Scott doesn't talk much about it anymore in interviews. They allegedly buried the hatchet a few years ago, but I can't help but feel like Scott still doesn't care for him much."
Earwolf,3dx5u6,SoberKeonClark,17,Mon Jul 20 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"Standups like Marc, Bill Burr, etc are just going to hate the improv comedy people, period. If you listen to Burr's podcast, he's always complaining about ""hipsters"" and alternative comedians. He thinks comedy is about ""AYY YA KNOW, A MAN GETS UP AND YA FUCKIN TELL IT LIKE IT IS, BOOM BANG BING"" and then pretending the mic stand is your dick and a bunch of other stupid shit. When he isn't going on rants about women, then it's usually about how ""ironic"" comedy sucks. I mean, hey, I love standup, but I also see it as mostly meat-headed horseshit. These 2 camps are just going to war with each other, period."
Earwolf,3dx5u6,novation123,5,Mon Jul 20 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"Idk if Bill Burr is exactly like this. His stand up has those mannerisms sure, but I'm a huge fan of his, and from following his podcast, and podcast appearances, it seems like he's honestly a pretty easy going guy.   He likes alternative comedy in TV shows and has appeared on even Professor Blastoff recently.   He's just more of an old 'grumpy angry white guy' comic. But I think he appreciates plenty of others."

Earwolf,3dvag5,archobler,6,Sun Jul 19 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, they hate each other now. The had a falling out a few years ago, I believe about a comedy central show they were pitching. But neither has ever told the story (as far as I know). They haven't talked to each other since (at least in a public forum)"
Earwolf,3dvag5,HipGuide,8,Sun Jul 19 20:57:32 2015 UTC,"On the last FMU show, Tom thanked him by name. The patented PFT laugh (from the Juggalos riff) is in the last FMU sound collage right around when Laurie talks."
Earwolf,3dvag5,archobler,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember that now. I was hoping that olive-branch would have brought about a reconciliation.   I've been thinking since Tom is doing stuff at Earwolf that maybe their paths will cross and they'll let bygones be bygones."
Earwolf,3dvag5,HipGuide,3,Sun Jul 19 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"When he does the 50 impressions in 10 minutes, someone calls and says PFT and Tom hangs up.   Tom may have described PFT once as ""the comic in LA who won't talk to me"", but I don't remember that from the show."
Earwolf,3dvag5,Fatmanredemption,7,Sun Jul 19 21:15:51 2015 UTC,"They'll make up one day! I have FAITH. You wouldn't believe how much overlap there is in the fanbases of these two. I'm a huge fan of the Best Show and I also love PFT (obviously, I'm posting on the Earwolf subreddit.) sigh Of course, what made me realize that their falling out was real was seeing that PFT follows AP Mike on Twitter but not Scharpling.  Perhaps a key difference is that Tom is willing to make fun of and criticize absolutely everyone (all in good fun, just teasing. Mostly. Unless it's like Ringo or Billy Joel,) whereas PFT has eased up on much of his sardonic attitudes in recent years. Maybe he just thinks Scharpling's too negative to hang around with? But I think even Tom has eased up on taking as many shots as he used to, or at least he makes sure to qualify most things.   For those not familiar with The Best Show I don't want to make it sound like it's just Tom going ""And you know who else pisses me off? INSERT NAME."" It's nothing like that. A lot of the humor has to do with Tom feigning an emotional investment in things he really doesn't care that much about, but you as the listener know he doesn't really care but you know he kind of does to an extent and he knows you know but sometimes some people don't know and that's pretty funny too?   If that sounds kind of ""hipstery"" or alienating, I think a good analogy is that it's kind of like Hollywood Handbook. It's that show you know you're supposed to get into but you kind of don't get it at first. Then maybe after a few tries you revisit the show months later and suddenly everything clicks and it's your favorite thing.  But to keep this last bit relevant, I don't believe they hate each other. On his last WFMU show, Tom did mention Paul F Tompkins. I'll direct quote it:  ""Having people like Patton Oswalt and, you know, Zack Galifinakis and Julie Klausner and Jason Woliner and Jon Daly and Paul F Tompkins and so many people who have come through here, who I think are the funniest people ever, and to have them want to be a part of this show and to eventually have a lot of them become my friends in real life is, again, inconceivable.""  Also, when Sean and Hayes were on the Best Show recently, Tom said Hollywood Handbook was his favorite podcast and that he had listened to every episode. PFT's on that like three times. I doubt Tom was seething with hatred. I think he'd love for that bridge to be mended."
Earwolf,3dvag5,HipGuide,5,Mon Jul 20 00:32:48 2015 UTC,"interesting sidenote: aukerman was sort of asked about scharpling in the ama. scharpling has been on cbb with pft although 3-4 years ago. aukerman said scharpling was/is too busy in la to do comedy bang bang, even though aukerman has asked him."
Earwolf,3dvag5,Quinez,2,Mon Jul 20 01:21:55 2015 UTC,"As much as I like the Best Show and Tom's bits, I wouldn't be surprised if working with him professionally was....very challenging? Bitterness does not work well professionally. Just look at Marc Maron (who I am also a big fan of) so needless to say, this isn't surprising at all."
Earwolf,3dvag5,Fatmanredemption,8,Mon Jul 20 00:19:32 2015 UTC,"PFT also strikes me as very competitive when it comes to comedy.  He sometimes slightly fumes on podcasts when someone steps on his line or doesn't give him a wide berth.  And he talks about being a more bitter kind of guy before he found his recent successes.  I think they both might self-conceive as beta males who know at heart that they want to be alpha males, so I can imagine some clashing between them."
Earwolf,3dvag5,jpatton89,2,Mon Jul 20 09:58:20 2015 UTC,"Eeechh... I mean, he's not Marc Maron bitter, he's just a little... has kind of a bit of uhh maybe defeatist attitude sometimes? Like, I guess if Maron at his worst was a 10, Scharpling can be a 6? Again I don't actually know what he's like outside of the Best Show but I can't see him being that horrible all around. I imagine the PFT thing was a real low point for both of them so I guess their worst sides were exacerbated at the time."

Earwolf,3dvag5,olenine,3,Mon Jul 20 03:41:01 2015 UTC,"It's called The Best Show. It ran for 10+ years on the radio and now airs live Tuesday nights on bestshow.net. And of course, is available as a podcast.  It's one of my favorite things.   ETA: The most recent episode of the podcast is a ""best of"" since the show was relaunched. Probably a good entry point."

It only takes like four episodes before you're fully on board in terms of understanding it.  I'd start with the current Podcast and then go back into the archives if you're curious. If you're using iTunes, start with the earliest available episode (MARC MARON! SHELDON JENNINGS! WHO IS THE LUCKIEST PERSON ALIVE?) and work your way up. It's a good one. I'm a little disappointed iTunes doesn't show all the episodes available. The libsyn link does. If you use that, start with maybe TOM'S INSANE PATTI SMITH STORY."

Without her (or one of her sunstitutes) it would just be an hour of Howard following every train of thought that come through his head. And while this sounds like an awesome show, that is not what Who Charted is."
Earwolf,3dyduh,drisawesome,4,Mon Jul 20 15:34:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, that was that recent Two Charted with just Howard wandering around his house, and I found it pretty unlistenable."
Earwolf,3dyduh,Anemoni,4,Mon Jul 20 22:08:49 2015 UTC,It was a fun novelty one time for 30 minutes but I wouldn't want to listen to that on a weekly basis.
Earwolf,3dyduh,Prax150,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:37:59 2015 UTC,Yep. I enjoyed it cause I knew it would be shortlived.
Earwolf,3dyduh,shadoire,29,Tue Jul 21 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"IMO she brings out the best in Howard. Every time Howard is alone, only with stard, or with a guest host I find Howard funny, but not as funny.   Kulap may do some repetitive things I guess (personally doesn't bother me but maybe I can see it) but I think it's because she knows how funny he is and wants the guest to share our and her reaction to his philosophy.   Personally to me she drives the show.  The guest hosts aren't bad, they're much better than when armen guest hosts IMO but when kulap is with Howard it's much better"
Earwolf,3dyduh,Slayner,4,Mon Jul 20 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Kulap knows how to prod Howard with questions until he says something hilariously weird. But he doesn't do that unless she leads him into a strange conversation. He's always funny, but my favorite parts of the show are when Ku Ku gets him rolling on something that leads to one of his weird philosophical thoughts that make no sense to anyone but him."
Earwolf,3dyduh,TheBlackSpank,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:30 2015 UTC,"I think she ""drives' the show for sure, but in an unnecessary and overbearing kind of way that stops a lot of tangents and conversations short. It seems like she makes the show less fun for first time guests by over explaining the show and howard's weird shit. Idk, I don't want to ruin the show for you or anything but for me it was something that once I noticed it I couldn't help but see it everywhere.   I think that's why I like two charted more sometimes because there's no outsider there, not because guests aren't fun and sometimes great but because there's no one there who Kulap feels like she has to explain shit to."
Earwolf,3dyduh,Slayner,20,Mon Jul 20 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"I mean you're welcome to your opinion it's fair. I just disagree. I think kulap brings out more of Howards stuff, but she occasionally HAS to stop him, because if she didn't it would just never finish, and Howard would be on a tangent forever.   The show is technically for the guest, not for Howard."
Earwolf,3dyduh,goofy_ball,20,Mon Jul 20 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"I love both Ku and How, but if I had to register my irritation with one of them, it'd be Howard for basically never listening to anything his co-host says. It's been kinda bad lately. I know it's Howie being charming Howie, but sometimes it's a bit much and is frustrating to me.  For real, though. Love the show. And I think Ku is way underappreciated."
Earwolf,3dyduh,Anemoni,4,Mon Jul 20 16:23:30 2015 UTC,I just can't wait for his tour to be over. Just a smidge tired of hearing about it.
Earwolf,3dyduh,shinja59,14,Mon Jul 20 22:09:34 2015 UTC,"It's not because Kulap is leaning on previous shows, it's because she wants to troll the crap out of Howard by forcing him to say some hilariously insane thought he had while riffing with close friends completely out of context, often to someone who doesn't know Howard that well/is new to the show. I personally love that she does it, although I did get pretty burned out on the constant pimping out of 'Gu Cruise' towards the end."
Earwolf,3dyduh,goofy_ball,6,Mon Jul 20 15:54:25 2015 UTC,"I wish more guests would take that ball and run with it instead of just rolling with Howard's insanity like it was the most natural thing in the world.  Edit: And over all, I like the show best when there's less self promotion. Gu Cruise is great fun, but as a listener of every episode, I was burned out too."
Earwolf,3dyduh,GeorgeTaylorG,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but I wouldn't call it ""lazy.""  She spends 2-4 hours a week on-mic with Howard, and when about half that time is dedicated to various Kremer rants, it's hard not to address them when they come up naturally. Part of it is exposing the guest to Howard's theories, and part of it is giving Howard the floor for something he's talked about for multiple weeks in a row."

Earwolf,3dyduh,advancedman,5,Mon Jul 20 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"It's not that unpopular of an opinion. I see it a decent amount on this sub. There was a sort of weird dissent against her doing her documentary and regular talk about her not being funny. I disagree. I don't really know how much I have to say about my disagreement, or that I really need to defend her. She's great at driving the show,  a perfect muse/foil for Howard, and I do find her funny and charming."
Earwolf,3dyduh,LaurenLapkus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"You don't have to defend her at all, I am not calling for a Ku-coup (ha!)...again, I don't dislike her or even think she's a bad host necessarily. She does have moments that take me out of it or annoy me pretty regularly, which isn't true of any other show I listen to every ep of, but I do listen to every ep, so what can I say.  Aspects of the doc thing did bug me, but I see no need to get into it."
Earwolf,3dyduh,CrouchJr,4,Mon Jul 20 19:21:09 2015 UTC,"I like Kulap just fine, I just feel like she doesn't have very many strong opinions on anything, and when she does it's always very ""Hollywood"" and I can pretty much predict it.  Unlike Howard where no one on this planet ever has a clue what will come out of his mouth at any given moment."
Earwolf,3dyduh,LaurenLapkus,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"That, and I just don't find her particularly funny or charming (considering she hosts a popular Earwolf show, anyway). Also she has pretty rough comedic timing, I've cringed more than a couple times from her stepping on good bits without realizing it.  People give her credit for bouncing off Howard well/bringing funny things out of him, but I feel like anyone who finds Howard funny and has decent banter as a 'straight (wo)man' can do that  (see: guest hosts, Stard, nearly every funny guest).  All that said, I love Whooch and Twooch and look forward starting off my day on a bright note twice a week with them, and so for being a huge part of that for the last few years I am super grateful."
Earwolf,3dyduh,CrouchJr,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"I only remember one time when I was actually annoyed with her,  it was a two charted and she was talking about how one of her neighbors had some kind of water/plumbing problem.  This neighbor approached her, and asked her if maybe the problem was actually coming from her and Scott's house, and he provided her with the phone number of a plumber (since I believe she was new to the neighborhood, having just moved into the house).  Kulap took this as a personal insult, and an attack on her being a woman.  Where as to me, it sounded like a neighbor being a really good neighbor and trying to solve a simple everyday problem as best as he could."
Earwolf,3dyduh,clown-from-neck-down,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:15 2015 UTC,I've always liked her and thought she does a good job. I mean I see your complaints and they make sense and all...but just not to me personally. Listened to every ep and never been bothered by any of those little things.
Earwolf,3dyduh,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Mon Jul 20 20:29:11 2015 UTC,I like Kulap. And even more importantly I like Kulap & Howard together.

Earwolf,3dyduh,Teenageboy69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:48 2015 UTC,"While I believe that Kulap does keep the show moving and on the right track, that's simply not enough. Anyone that Howard is close with can lead his comedic sensibilities to water. The other guest hosts have done the same thing she's done, and have done (imo) a better job in regards to make me laugh and/or giving insightful feedback regarding the charts. I like Kulap and Whooch is one of my favorite shows, but the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" mentality is flawed."
Earwolf,3dyduh,daaaaaaaaniel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:27 2015 UTC,Sometimes I feel bad for Howard. There have been some times where it seems like he's being serious about something then a phrase or a word he says cracks Kulap up. It throws his train of thought off and derails the conversation.

Earwolf,3dweqy,Antonton,6,Mon Jul 20 02:25:16 2015 UTC,"The Comedy Insider Podcast is hosted by Scott Dikkers, comedy writer and founding editor of The Onion. By his own description, it's a podcast of ""serious conversations about comedy"". He talks a lot with his guests about how they got to where they are today, and it's a great listen for comedy nerds especially.  This episode has pretty crappy audio quality, unfortunately, but he's also done episodes with other Earwolf guests Weird Al and Ellie Kemper that don't have that issue at all."

S&H have no trouble forcing a bit that doesn't work into something that is really bizarre and brilliant.  I also like off hand comments that somehow snow ball into world building (i.e. Hayes saying something about Sean having to stay in the basement one time and that turned into Sean's bad ass basement apartment through line).
Earwolf,3duknc,Quinez,5,Sun Jul 19 20:52:29 2015 UTC,Those ads also got me hooked.  They were usually better than the actual CBB episode.  They were really effective advertisements!  Not necessarily for Harry's or whatever though.

Earwolf,3duknc,apaeter,16,Sun Jul 19 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"While I fully agree that I am immersed in HH and love it, I gotta say I would never skip a new UTU2TM or CBB for an old ep.   I'm all for diversity in comedy, Hayes and Sean are great, but it can't be the only podcast I listen to.   Glad you like it though, those on the fence should definitely give it a shot."
Earwolf,3duknc,ntboa,6,Sun Jul 19 17:40:50 2015 UTC,I'm the same way.  I'll skip CBBs now to listen to old HHs if the guests are not great.  I did have to listen to the new UTU2TM though.... then back to HHs

For god's sake, I even listened to to the PFT episode and I think I hardly got a grin out of the experience. Listened to a few other eps too, and as far as I can tell it's kind of an ironic version of some sort of show-business-insider talk, consisting of improvised bits? Nothing wrong with that, just happens that I'm not enjoying their particular riffs and tone as much as I do with other podcasts. Or am I totally missing some extra layer here?"
Earwolf,3duknc,Slayner,4,Mon Jul 20 00:41:21 2015 UTC,"No show is gonna be liked by everyone and that's not a problem.  When Sean and Hayes were on the Best Show with Tom Scharpling, Sean summed up the show as, ""Trying to replicate the worst fucking conversations you overhear in Hollywood coffee shops"".  I grew up and live in LA and have heard people unironically say a lot of stuff that would fit right into an episode of Hollywood Handbook.

Coupled with some improvised bits like when they read scripts. But basically it's just sarcasm taken to an extreme. You just gotta embrace that the entire bit from beginning to end is just a sarcastic take on how great they are and cutural fads"

Paul Scheer may be my favorite episode of any podcast ever, they read a script in this one, and basically act out an entire movie. Paul was a great guest  Mary Holland is a great episode, and I recently just listened to an episode that was hysterical Jessica Williams  And finally, the Neil Campbell episode was fantastic too.   Those are just a few   Shelby Fero ep = The Anti Sean and Hayes (she plays a straight man)  Paul Scheer = Script reading for a movie  Jessica Williams = Solid 'Normal episode'   Mary Holland = Solid 'Normal episode'   Neil Cambell = Sean and Hayes doing a new podcast with Neil (improvised episodes of a podcast for their network wolfcool)  Edit: Oh and Obama can't do the show, Sean and Hayes try to keep politics out of the show, they don't like to take a stance on much at all, things like Slavery and what wage a woman should make."

Oh and I saw her as part of a semi-improvised production of Frankenstein put on by Neil Campbell and Paul Rust and she held her own up there and stole the scene a few times. I think she's gonna blow up soon. She's just so talented, not to mention super adorable."
Earwolf,3dtxx2,oshoney,7,Sun Jul 19 14:07:48 2015 UTC,Took the lead? As in Lapkus is usually the 'leader'? I don't think so. Lapkus is great at cbb-style character improv but I find Mary to usually be the strongest one when they do long-form.

Also since they're available, anyone who hasn't heard The Long Shot Podcast episode with Jack McBrayer, it's fucking gold.  EDIT: I think the first half of season 3 isn't available. It starts at #314 with Jen Kirkman. Possibly dissappearing one at a time with each new episode?"
Earwolf,3dtxx2,unverified_user,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"Nope, 314 has been the oldest episode up for a long time. I think that's when they started using libsyn."
Earwolf,3dtxx2,Slayner,5,Mon Jul 20 23:43:20 2015 UTC,"All of her wild horses appearances, I4H and CBB appearances are so great. But her Hollywood Handbook appearance, and even professor blastoff appearance were two of the funniest appearances ever.   I'd love to see a wild horses show at some point."
Earwolf,3dtxx2,Quinez,4,Sun Jul 19 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"I like how her Hollywood Handbook appearance made Podmass.  It drew a lot of attention to her.  I hope that she hits on a truly amazing character to bring to CBB at some point.  That's the sort of thing that really elevates an actor to public awareness.  Trabitha Tarteen isn't at the level of a Marissa Wompler or a Tracy Reardon or a Gino, but I'm pretty sure Mary Holland has a character like that in her somewhere."

Earwolf,3dtxx2,sm33,3,Mon Jul 20 04:15:38 2015 UTC,"Love Mary Holland! I've seen her do a ton of shows at UCB (ASSSSCAT, Playhouse Masterpieces, Dead Authors), and she is so quick & witty. Hearing her on a podcast has never been a disappointment - her Improv4Humans eps (like ""What's Your Profession"" from January of this year) are so good. It always makes me happy to see her in a show. I still haven't caught a Wild Horses show, but I can imagine how good they are together."
Earwolf,3dtxx2,Velvet_Llama,2,Sun Jul 19 19:33:20 2015 UTC,Such a great choice for a respect thread. She is ridiculously talented and I get excited whenever I see her pop up as a guest on a podcast. She kills it every time she's on I4H.

Earwolf,3dv7so,HipGuide,5,Sun Jul 19 21:13:20 2015 UTC,I shop at Bonobos. They're customer service is pretty great. They upgraded me to free shipping on an order when I was worried a jacket wouldn't make it in time for a wedding. I'd definitely recommend them if you like the style of clothes they sell.
Earwolf,3dv7so,10goldbees,3,Sun Jul 19 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"Second on Bonobos after becoming a Sklarbro fan. Shipping and returns are always free and fast, great customer service. A little pricy for what it is sometimes, but you can get some good deals during sales. Love the tweed blazer I got from them, great material.  Has anyone tried that mattress place or the sheets one?"
Earwolf,3dv7so,wickethewok,3,Mon Jul 20 02:33:57 2015 UTC,"Speaking of me undies, Bill Burr has the best ad read ever for them  Anyway, I was lazy one day and I signed up then canceled my subscription to stamps.com it's good if you actually need to mail stuff, but aside from using ups I never mail anything.   Trunk club is expensive but if you hate shopping for clothes it's kinda cool. I like that it's a completely free service for them just to mail the stuff.   Bought a shirt on bonobos before I used trunk club. Good customer service but really expensive for nothing fancy. Eh.   I'm sure audible would be cool if I decided to listen to something other than podcasts for a change.   Oh and the one consistent thing I use but it was only briefly sponsored, is bark box. Bark box is totally worth it, in fact I got a new box yesterday.   Good diversity of toys, chews, and treats, and it's only 20 bucks a month.   In short I only use two, trunk club and barkbox. Barkbox is the only one I actually really use, I've only bought 2 shirts on trunk club because they're also pretty expensive -- it's just a cool service.   The easiest way to help out earwolf is just use that earwolf Amazon link. I have it bookmarked. Plus I'm an Amazon addict, I buy everything online, so I'm sure that helps a little."
Earwolf,3dv7so,Slayner,4,Sun Jul 19 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"I use the Amazon Earwolf links, and my husband uses Audible on his commute to work. I tried NatureBox but wasn't particularly impressed."

Earwolf,3dv7so,_buch,2,Sun Jul 19 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think my choice would be between Never Not Funny and Who Charted?  If it really matters, I'd probably go with Who Charted? because sometimes I'm sad (weird?) that their ads are just for Howard, because I think maybe they aren't as well financially supported as other shows or something.   But, I'm fairly certain I first heard about it on NNF, so there's that."

Earwolf,3dv7so,void_rocket,4,Mon Jul 20 16:15:19 2015 UTC,I was on a tight budget so I went to pro flowers to get their $20 bouquet with free glass vase and in the end it comes out to around $50 dollars with shipping and other fees. Never falling for another sponsor again. For the most part I already have a preferred retailer for most of the stuff I hear advertised and I guarantee I pay less.
Earwolf,3dv7so,Paul_Gorfengensen,3,Mon Jul 20 02:44:36 2015 UTC,Same with Sherries Berries.  It ended up being like double what it was supposed to cost.

Earwolf,3dv7so,jarluch,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"So, Loot Crate. Got a 3 month subscription for my son as a birthday present.   It is really pretty shitty, a box of knick knacks. If you don't love getting a t-shirt, then the value is really not there. I think they say each crate has a $75 dollar retail value, but there is no way. Last month's cyber crate was literally just posters and mouse pads and stuff that is just cheap."

When they have a t-shirt is pretty good but you have to pick and choose which months and themes to go with and be a little lucky. Comments about Lootcrste here seem to be negative but if you like that kind of stuff it can be pretty cool.

He has interviewed some of the  shows's best writers on his podcast which is pretty laid back and insightful. Chris Hardwick had talked about the podcast on Nerdist with Gillian Anderson, which she responded to with enthusiasm. He freaked out like a schoolboy. Cut to today...

Earwolf,3dqcvv,carpadium,4,Sat Jul 18 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"""Evo"" the biggest fighting games tournament ever is this weekend in Las Vegas so I'll be tuning in for a bunch of Melee. I also want to catch Ant-Man and find time to watch Tig, has anybody watched either of them yet? What'd you think?   Paul F has been mentioning on Spont that people on the forums ask his opening questions to one-another for fun. I haven't seen us doing that on the episode posts so why don't we do it here? I don't have to be the one posting them every week just whoever feels like it but I'd be happy to start.   I'm still a little behind but the question asked to Jen Kirkman was ""Do you believe in ghosts? Where is your evidence?""  I don't believe in ghosts now but when I was a teenager I was completely terrified of anything paranormal and a fictional ghost fucked my life up for about 2 weeks. I didn't watch any horror movies because they just paralyzed me with terror. I specifically remember being extra terrified of the premise of Silence of the Lambs which is ironic because of how much I love Hannibal as an adult. When I was 15 for some reason I became obsessed with the Amityville Horror case. I read everything about it leading up to the 2005 Ryan Reynolds movie version. I went to see the movie with some friends, and even though I was familiar with the story,  there was one scene where Ryan Reynolds is in the bathroom and in classic horror cliché fashion he bends down to wash his face in the sink and when he looks up in the mirror there is the ghost of a skinned man behind him. I literally threw my Mountain Dew into the air in the theater. In the story, the main character keeps waking up at 3:15 am which is the time that the previous family in the house were all murdered until he starts going insane.   After I got home from the movie I went into my bathroom fully expecting to see a skinned man standing in there, when I turned the light on not only did it blow it burnt out so hard it cracked and made a loud popping sound which made me not have to use the bathroom anymore. I was able to finally convince myself to go to bed but in the middle of the night I sprang awake. 3:15 am. Instant panic attack follows. The next night I go to sleep and wake up again at 3:15 am again instantly freaking out. This goes on for two weeks until it just became stupid instead of scary but for awhiiiiile I was living in the Amityville Horror."
Earwolf,3dqcvv,nicemaker,5,Sat Jul 18 14:02:02 2015 UTC,I like to think if I ever become a ghost I'll use that boundless freedom to fully explore the wonders of this universe. But then there's that nagging certainty that I'll probably just watch celebrities fuck.
Earwolf,3dqcvv,Shampoodler,3,Sat Jul 18 14:32:27 2015 UTC,I have this same thought. If I could chose my own after life I would be a ghost. The world would become my own personal reality tv show.

Earwolf,3dqcvv,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Sat Jul 18 14:06:58 2015 UTC,"I also don't believe in ghosts, but oh my god most of my family is a firm believer in them.   I grew up in Savannah GA, which is like ghost capitol of the world. So we would always go on ghost tours, and see the 'haunted houses' downtown. I would always hear all these stories growing up -- little things like, the door kept opening, or there was always a bowl of cereal on the counter no matter what, just these little things 'ghosts were doing'   So for a few weeks early on my youth I became severely self aware of every single thing I did, that way if something happened that I didn't remember doing I could say 'oh that was a ghost!'   Unfortunately there were no signs of ghosts, and also I'm still stupidly self aware of almost everything I do lol"

PFT was killing it as Mr. Peanut Butter. I love a great comedy that isn't afraid to get very dark and emotional at the expense of laughs. Such a well written show with immense rewatchability.   Helped a friend move this morning, of course he chose one of the hottest days of the summah so far here in Ohio, but we finished up before the worst heat.   I'll probably check out the Tig doc tonight, along with maybe Jupiter Ascending so I can finally listen to the HDTGM ep for it. I know it had some pretty bad reviews, but I've never really hated any of the Wachowski flicks, and I've been meaning to see it anyway.

Earwolf,3dqcvv,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,3,Sat Jul 18 13:26:28 2015 UTC,That Wilco came out of nowhere. I finally listened to it this morning and love it. Love the album title/cover too.   Also I think I need to listen to the new Tame Impala a couple more times before I decide if I like it or not. It's just so different.   Also it's still hard for me to turn off I Love You Honeybear to listen to anything new. I think that and Run the Jewels 2 have been my most listened to albums the past month or so.
Earwolf,3dqcvv,10goldbees,3,Sat Jul 18 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a massive Tame Impala fan and I love the new album.

In fact, I think there's a pretty consistent track record of female comedians that have gained mass attention because their acts basically sound like mirror images of the typical sexist male routine, and I can list them if you really want me to.  Meanwhile female comedians that don't go down that route (Tig, Maria Bamford, etc.) always seem to be the underground darlings of the comedy scene, and don't get TV shows and movies offered to them.  Am I just imagining this shit or is this Hollywood voodoo at work?"
Earwolf,3dqcvv,oshoney,4,Sun Jul 19 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"Have you seen her tv show?    It's pretty different from her stand up and is kind of enjoyable.     I watched Trainwreck last night.... damn that was an AMAZING movie.  I'm a huge Judd fan too, and them together, was a great combination.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  A lot of subtle twists of gender norms too, like Amy likes to do.  Highly recommend it.  Also has great cameos throughout it, including Claudia O'Doherty.  John Cena, and Lebron James end up being hilarious too."
Earwolf,3dqcvv,SpcAgentDaleCooper,3,Sun Jul 19 12:14:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're right for the most part, I don't have a ton of input because I haven't listened to a lot of her stuff, but it's a pretty well vocalized complaint.   People said the same thing about Sarah Silverman years ago, and while a lot of her set was kinda like that she had a lot more depth IMO   It's always sunny did a great parody of this For S09E01 The Gang Broke Dee where Dee got stupidly famous as a comedian and her entire set was being disgusting and vulgar. Frank at one point in the episode was laughing and went 'it's funny cause she's a woman!'   So I think it's a pretty common view."
Earwolf,3dpi4a,ElectricMarmalade,26,Sat Jul 18 04:57:15 2015 UTC,I forgot how insane the podcast commentary idea/execution was. I remember the first few seconds when I first listened to this ep and heard four Scotts talking over each other and almost went insane.
Earwolf,3dpi4a,Randy_Tutelage,13,Sat Jul 18 06:21:27 2015 UTC,I thought something was wrong with my ipod for the first few moments.

Earwolf,3dpi4a,ELBdelorean,8,Sat Jul 18 16:05:24 2015 UTC,Also more reasonable than assuming these two nutjobs decided to record a commentary episode

Earwolf,3doxy7,Slayner,20,Sat Jul 18 01:39:47 2015 UTC,"You are seriously the #1 Earwolf fan. That's an incredible run through of all the eps. My favorite is def the Besser one because of how murderous he sounds every time Armen says something.   I haven't listened to earlier ones so I'll definitely take you up on it, especially the Ben Schwartz episode"
Earwolf,3doxy7,WeeBabySeamus,10,Sat Jul 18 02:19:27 2015 UTC,"The ben schwartz episode is super user friendly I highly recommend it. I couldn't fit it in but also the first Doug Benson episode is really good too.   I could go on and on about my recommendations for this podcast, but I think you get the gist in this post.   As far as me being the #1 fan, I wish I had the money to support them more than just posting and commenting on their content, but for now that's all I can do!   I freaking love these things."
Earwolf,3doxy7,PDCchewie88,10,Sat Jul 18 02:24:33 2015 UTC,"Totally agree about the personal feeling of the show. I've been listening since the beginning, probably after Scott promoted it on CBB or something, and it's really a testament to the intimate nature of podcasts because Howie and KuKu (and more recently Stard) truly feel like close friends of mine (who I've never actually met in person).   It's really amazing when I stop I think about it because I had no idea who either of them were before listening to Whooch, just that I trusted a recommendation from Hot Saucerman. While it's not always the funniest Earwolf show, it's been my favorite show for quite some time, mainly due to their chemistry.   And I can only imagine the madness that a constant stream of Kremer philosophizing might induce over a binge like that, you poor soul. Never change, Wie, never change...."
Earwolf,3doxy7,oshoney,7,Sat Jul 18 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"I have some big laughs on the show, but you're right it's not necessarily the funniest podcast, but god damn if I can't stress the hosting strength of this show enough. I don't hear nearly enough about it it's insane how good of a duo Kulap and Howard make.   Anyway. As far as the effect Howard has had on my mind, I honestly think he's had an impact to say the least. I'm kinda looking forward to taking it in smaller doses and listening to something new.   It was fun, but it's been a serious lifechanger"
Earwolf,3doxy7,Cantkillabullmoose,2,Sat Jul 18 02:40:28 2015 UTC,What's next? Still gonna do Pistol Shrimps Radio?
Earwolf,3doxy7,Home-Baked,2,Sat Jul 18 05:10:36 2015 UTC,Yup that's next
Earwolf,3doxy7,ScottyNuttz,5,Sat Jul 18 12:29:24 2015 UTC,"This show has the best themes! All around, Howard's songs are so catchy. I started listening around January and have done a few of the old eps, but maybe I will venture into more of the guests I like. This show has made me adore kulap. I like Howard, but without ku I wouldn't listen. She's the best."
Earwolf,3doxy7,Teenageboy69,3,Sat Jul 18 03:39:24 2015 UTC,"Kulap is the unsung hero of this podcast, but it's so clear that everything I mean literally -- not figuratively everything about this podcast hinges on her.  Not only does she bring out the best in Howard and react the best, she keeps the show flowing, and herself is very funny, at the very least seems so much like a person so fun to hang out with and so relatable to real life."
Earwolf,3doxy7,TheAmazingApathyMan,4,Sat Jul 18 03:47:27 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I dont know... I really enjoyed the Natty Legs guest host episode because she was on board with Howard's ideas and weirdness instead of constantly pointing out how weird he is being.  Also now that I think about it, my favourite episode might be the one with just Howard and Stard walking the streets with a mic and saying goodbye to the old Earwolf studio and reminiscing about the PonChik Factory (sp).  Not in any way dissing Kulap but when you think about the episodes where Howard is replaced vs Ku, I think the Howardless ones are more jarring."
Earwolf,3doxy7,LaurenLapkus,2,Sun Jul 19 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"I hear you, they're not bad, but I do feel the episodes with kulap are better personally.   Not only does she bring out the best in Howard, she keeps the show on tracks."
Earwolf,3doxy7,myhandleonreddit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"I think she's pretty well sung. I mean, there only two of them."
Earwolf,3doxy7,daaaaaaaaniel,2,Sat Jul 18 05:00:15 2015 UTC,Maybe that was the wrong phrasing. She definitely deserves more credit than she gets IMO
Earwolf,3doxy7,vagued,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"I think that while Ku does a great job in her role, there have been others that did it better. I thought April Richardson was the best guest host. She did everything that Kulap did and then some."
Earwolf,3doxy7,vagued,4,Sun Jul 19 13:37:40 2015 UTC,"Howard and Kulap really do have a great dynamic. Whooch might not be the first podcast I go to when the new eps are up, but if I have the time I'll listen to it no matter who the guest is. And if it involves Armen or Scott I listen to it immediately."
Earwolf,3doxy7,VanceFerguson,4,Sat Jul 18 05:31:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting you liked 182 so much while not being an Armen fan. To me Besser came off as affectionately frustrated, but it felt largely played up for comedy and came from a place of thinking Armen is super funny and talented  (which does not seem to be where you're coming from). I do like how Besser and Soccermom call Armen out on his idiosyncrasies, though."
Earwolf,3doxy7,indorock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"I could easily swap it out with the first doug benson episode, but the reason I put it in there is it was nice nice for somone to call out his crap.   Every other guest including Kulap up to that point only laughed and went ""oh armen"" but Scott and Besser not only laughed but essentially were like, what the hell is wrong with you, speak clearly.   And Besser was great at doing just that, while still joking around and having a good time with him"
Earwolf,3doxy7,GeorgeTaylorG,3,Sat Jul 18 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"Just in case anybody hated the Armen episodes, loved the Matty B episode and somehow didn't see their later Whiplash satire that it inspired: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIol1E2B15Q"

Earwolf,3doxy7,Quinez,2,Sat Jul 18 18:54:02 2015 UTC,I loved that Armen episode and Armen is hilarious. Part of that episode has to be an act right? Have you listened to the Improv4Humans with Armen?

Earwolf,3dormc,novation123,16,Sat Jul 18 01:26:03 2015 UTC,The Nerdist is pretty much terrible. But it's also not meant for me. Hardwick reminds me of the hyperactive student government try-hard assholes I went to school with.

Earwolf,3dormc,woahthereareladies,11,Sat Jul 18 13:51:20 2015 UTC,I could see that being way outside of Scott's comfort zone. I think the fact that he hasn't done it yet conforms that.
Earwolf,3dormc,TvsPhil,6,Sat Jul 18 04:05:50 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this. I feel like in Comedy Bang Bang anytime it starts to get personal Scott almost compulsively steers it back towards jokes. Like anytime anyone tries to ask a sincere question about Kulap its almost always a joke, the one with Tig recently anytime she talked about her difficult time with cancer he kept inserting jokes, etc."
Earwolf,3dormc,thelostdolphin,11,Sat Jul 18 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda glad about that. I've always loved how CBB is generally pure comedy content. Real issues, politics, religion, etc, are things I have no interest in for this particular podcast.  It's not like I don't have serious views, but I just see CBB as pure cartoony comedy.  Sure, sometimes things like politics or religion come up but it tends to either be very light or a short bit.  That being said, it didn't bother me when Tig talked about her cancer because she's a fellow host, a funny guest who is rarely serious even if she's dry and the thing she was promoting was very much about her trials and career."
Earwolf,3dormc,splice_of_life,6,Sat Jul 18 04:57:11 2015 UTC,"He's like that outside of the CBB setting too though. He's just a pretty shy, reserved guy. Not to over analyze him, but I think playing an alter-ego ""Scott"" allows him to be more outgoing than he would personally. Sort of like those shy awkward kids from high school can somehow be total hams on the stage during the HS musical."
Earwolf,3dormc,vagued,4,Sat Jul 18 13:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think you nailed it, I also get this feeling."
Earwolf,3dormc,manyproblems,6,Sun Jul 19 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"Or the recent Solo-bolo.  It seemed like Ben was trying to have an actual sincere moment, and Scott turned it into silliness immediately."
Earwolf,3dormc,read_the_article_,5,Sat Jul 18 08:34:21 2015 UTC,"If you want to hear him tell a personal story without inserting jokes, listen to him on Go Bayside. He tells a story about a teacher touching him in a sexual way without joking about it. He doesn't get too serious, he just speaks about it in a very matter of fact way. It was pretty interesting to hear him speak about his experience that way."
Earwolf,3dormc,theenigmaofnolan,2,Sun Jul 19 03:36:41 2015 UTC,"a teacher touching him in a sexual way   My name is rapping Scott and I'm here to say, my teacher touched me in a sexual way  God, his ability to turn the serious into silliness has infected me!"
Earwolf,3dormc,JonBoyWhite,2,Sun Jul 19 06:56:04 2015 UTC,I think that's more of keeping the tone of Comedy Bang Bang humorous.

Even include Scott Anchorman to tell about their podcast business.  I could see a really great Spinal Tap-level mockumentary out of this.

Earwolf,3dm9se,ajp0002,13,Fri Jul 17 17:21:43 2015 UTC,The netflix ratings are actually geared towards your account individually and not an overall rating.  I think some people on here were seeing low ratings on it.  I'm wondering if it was posted with some odd label that is causing it to receive low rating from standup comedy fans.
Earwolf,3dm9se,FugitiveDribbling,12,Fri Jul 17 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"Its categorized under Gay & Lesbian Movies. Personally don't remember ever having a movie have that listing in my queue before. So maybe it's just me, but for me that's why I think it has a lower initial rating."
Earwolf,3dm9se,oposssom,6,Fri Jul 17 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's it, or at least it isn't for me.  Netflix has noticed that I watch documentaries, comedy movies, standup specials, and gay/lesbian movies in the past, but it still thought that I'd give Tig 1.5 stars."
Earwolf,3dm9se,vagued,10,Fri Jul 17 20:49:23 2015 UTC,Why did the do that? They made a film about Tig because she was dying not because she's a lesbian. Stephanie doesn't even really come into the film until close to the end.
Earwolf,3dm9se,oposssom,4,Fri Jul 17 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's too bad.  Just because it's a movie that includes lesbians, does that make it a lesbian movie?  Do they organize things in this way so that no one ever has a chance of accidentally being exposed to something that might make them uncomfortable?  Because if that's the reason, it's a damn shame."
Earwolf,3dm9se,Bigsaskatuna,5,Sat Jul 18 08:38:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's a Netflix original, so I'm sure it will show up on everyone's suggested anyway. I think it's more for people seeking out LGBT movies rather then helping people avoid them"
Earwolf,3dm9se,Pluppets,6,Sat Jul 18 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, I watch a lot of stand up and documentaries and both Tig and Eugene Mirmans new special got 1 star ratings. It's like after all these years Netflix doesn't even know me, you know? Maybe it's just me, but for me, I'd like my streaming services to know a little bit more about what I like and stop forcing the cream to the bottom of the barrel!"
Earwolf,3dm9se,LTownGetDown,3,Sat Jul 18 02:42:15 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. thanks!"
Earwolf,3dm9se,Redjobnuns,3,Fri Jul 17 17:50:10 2015 UTC,I had a low rating for it too. I think it might be because I don't watch many documentaries. I had something similar happen with Life Itself (the Ebert docu).
Earwolf,3dm9se,Cantkillabullmoose,11,Fri Jul 17 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"It's odd, I have one and a half stars too, but I watch tons of stand up comedy, documentaries, gay and female centric stuff on Netflix. I think it is a burp in their algorithm."
Earwolf,3dm9se,Starence,3,Sat Jul 18 02:41:48 2015 UTC,"Agree, I get recommended both documentaries and gay and lesbian films and this documentary was a suggested one and a half stars for me. I gave it a five."
Earwolf,3dm9se,technicalityNDBO,5,Sat Jul 18 03:40:37 2015 UTC,"It showed as 1.5 stars for me too earlier, now it looks like about 4.9."
Earwolf,3dm9se,Slayner,20,Sat Jul 18 07:28:00 2015 UTC,I love documentaries of all stars and stripes
Earwolf,3dm9se,GiantDeviantPiano,13,Fri Jul 17 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"Will watch this later, I'm really excited I mean Jesus christ she's had one hell of a journey"
Earwolf,3dm9se,branmuffinzed,13,Fri Jul 17 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"I've kinda been waiting for this since the first (and 2nd,3rd) time I cried listening to live"
Earwolf,3dm9se,Gnarlstone,14,Fri Jul 17 16:08:01 2015 UTC,But did it go up at 12:01
Earwolf,3dm9se,CrouchJr,10,Fri Jul 17 16:11:54 2015 UTC,Watched it this morning.  It is really quite good.
Earwolf,3dm9se,halfgrace,9,Fri Jul 17 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"What star rating is it showing for you guys?    It's giving me a one star for some reason.  I'm going to watch it anyways, but that surprised me given that I comedy, and stand up as always recommended to me by Netflix"
Earwolf,3dm9se,PDCchewie88,10,Fri Jul 17 16:42:13 2015 UTC,"Same, I thought that was weird. Rated it 5 stars after watching. Take that, Netflix recommendations!"
Earwolf,3dm9se,Gnarlstone,3,Fri Jul 17 17:01:40 2015 UTC,Mine shows 1.5. I'm not sure why.
Earwolf,3dm9se,Condawg,6,Fri Jul 17 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"Me as well. Looking at the related titles it has for it on the app, it looks like they've got it classified more as a documentary about women overcoming major life obstacles (which I've never really watched on Netflix) rather than a documentary about comedy/comedians (of which I've seen dozens)."
Earwolf,3dm9se,samantha-mulder,3,Fri Jul 17 17:11:39 2015 UTC,It was 1.5 for me too.  Seemed odd.
Earwolf,3dm9se,brockodile,3,Fri Jul 17 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm getting a 1.5 star rating, but all the reviews are really positive. Weird. It must be a bug."
Earwolf,3dm9se,TheAmazingApathyMan,9,Sat Jul 18 00:38:57 2015 UTC,Really good!!! Also some great shots of that TLT.
Earwolf,3dm9se,Trill_billl,6,Sat Jul 18 01:54:25 2015 UTC,Is this an episode of Tig Doc?
Earwolf,3dm9se,imnotthatbaked,6,Fri Jul 17 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"Couldn't help but cry, several times. Really really good."
Earwolf,3dm9se,void_rocket,6,Sat Jul 18 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats"
Earwolf,3dm9se,TheBlackSpank,4,Fri Jul 17 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"For all the shit she went through, she deserves it all."
Earwolf,3dm9se,cheeno,4,Sat Jul 18 03:42:07 2015 UTC,I had no idea Stephanie was straight and this was a new thing for her.
Earwolf,3dmnhm,TheFunkiestKong,11,Fri Jul 17 14:41:19 2015 UTC,Now I want to know what was discovered in the woods...
Earwolf,3dmnhm,credibit,7,Fri Jul 17 15:16:17 2015 UTC,probably someone getting sent to China
Earwolf,3dmnhm,MadMan2012,6,Fri Jul 17 17:16:26 2015 UTC,We better call China and get the details.
Earwolf,3dmnhm,jgd2w,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"Just write a letter addressed to ""the person who popped out of the Earth, China"" and just wait for a reply."
Earwolf,3dmnhm,MadMan2012,6,Fri Jul 17 21:09:10 2015 UTC,It'd be quicker to just call China and set the record straight.
Earwolf,3dmnhm,jgd2w,4,Fri Jul 17 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"""Hang up, Hang up, Hang up!"""
Earwolf,3dmnhm,stenchwinslow,3,Sat Jul 18 12:46:47 2015 UTC,one of the my absolute favorite moments ever to happen on CBB.
Earwolf,3dmnhm,unholypencil,3,Sat Jul 18 14:02:39 2015 UTC,Middleditch's had a monster CBB coming out party that episode. I started watching Silicon Valley solely because of Joey Tortillini and the sassy phone guy from China.
Earwolf,3dmnhm,stenchwinslow,2,Sat Jul 18 16:48:27 2015 UTC,"Hell of an episode for sure. Yeah SV is a phenomenal show, pretty much every aspect of it is so well crafted."
Earwolf,3dnb7r,gregkoko,7,Fri Jul 17 17:42:30 2015 UTC,TCGS is tied with The Best Show as my favorite comedy thing of all time. EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH THIS!! DON'T BE A BUNCH OF CHUMPS!
Earwolf,3dnb7r,Instergraham,2,Sat Jul 18 01:14:12 2015 UTC,a 'sclusie?
Earwolf,3dnb7r,KingDongBundy,2,Sun Jul 19 06:07:18 2015 UTC,Was that whole thing scripted or did he actually walk up to a complete stranger and take his hand and say all of that amazing shit?!
Earwolf,3dnb7r,mack-megaton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:27 2015 UTC,Walked up to a stranger.  TCGS is improvised (though each show has a loose structure/is based on a specific topic).  Highly recommend checking it out!  They stream the taping every Tuesday night on www.thechrisgethardshow.com and it airs on Fusion (home of PFT's No You Shut Up) Thursdays at 10!
Earwolf,3dma7x,mi-16evil,10,Fri Jul 17 12:38:41 2015 UTC,I tweeted this at Scott and Benny! Scott loves it!
Earwolf,3dma7x,Jakemasterflex,6,Fri Jul 17 17:38:08 2015 UTC,This made my day. Thank you so much.
Earwolf,3dma7x,chicknsandwich,6,Fri Jul 17 14:35:08 2015 UTC,That was incredible. Well done
Earwolf,3dma7x,bill__the__butcher,5,Fri Jul 17 18:54:52 2015 UTC,This is really well done.
Earwolf,3dma7x,headless_bourgeoisie,5,Fri Jul 17 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I listened to this like three times. It made me so happy. Thank you"
Earwolf,3dma7x,Cantkillabullmoose,5,Fri Jul 17 19:45:11 2015 UTC,That's a good song!
Earwolf,3dma7x,JustSomeGuy222,4,Fri Jul 17 20:15:54 2015 UTC,I think we need a two man show for Broadway.
Earwolf,3dma7x,traiden,4,Fri Jul 17 14:34:28 2015 UTC,This is sick!
Earwolf,3dma7x,Sammyboy74,5,Fri Jul 17 17:58:50 2015 UTC,This is really awesome. How did you balance the vocals and music so well? What's your pipeline? Because it's so well mixed.
Earwolf,3dma7x,Microtiger,9,Fri Jul 17 19:36:24 2015 UTC,"Hey Thanks!  Listening back to it, it actually sounds a little vocal-heavy to me.  I just recorded the audio off the podcast from my phone, and built up the tracks around it.  Tweaked levels at the end.  Mapping out the tempo and making a click to hold it together was the most time consuming part."
Earwolf,3dma7x,hartiganmusic,5,Fri Jul 17 19:42:54 2015 UTC,Great job! Glad Scott and Benny saw it and retweeted. I found it when I was listening to your Taye Brigston accompaniment. Please keep doing podcast accompaniment!
Earwolf,3dma7x,hartiganmusic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:26:56 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! It's a really great hobby.  The inspirational opportunities only come up so often.  Please feel free to make suggestions. :)
Earwolf,3dma7x,Microtiger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's neat. Did you use Audacity or something? FL Studio for the backing?"
Earwolf,3dma7x,hartiganmusic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:25:06 2015 UTC,"I used digital performer.  It has a similar interface to pro-tools.  The backing tracks are all instrument patches from my keyboard, a Yamaha Motif.  I just recorded myself playing each instrument one at a time with a click mapped to the tempo of the  singing, starting with a pretty simple piano accompaniment and building the other parts around that.  A little level tweakage, some reverb, and there it is."
Earwolf,3dma7x,sm33,3,Sun Jul 19 10:15:50 2015 UTC,"Their lyrics to ""Maybe"" made me laugh on the podcast, but are absolutely killing me with the accompaniment.   Congrats, this is awesome!"
Earwolf,3dma7x,ksaid1,3,Fri Jul 17 21:49:22 2015 UTC,this is amazing!
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Slayner,31,Fri Jul 17 11:01:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, and think /u/Slayner would make an excellent moderator.  I think it's extraordinary that the inactivity of the mods hasn't been more robustly addressed before now. I'm pretty sure that in the time it has taken for /u/Neon1986 to explain how busy he is he could have just added a new moderator.  I don't know if 'message the moderators' on the sidebar has any effect but I for one am going to give it a go."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,DocMaturin,14,Fri Jul 17 11:48:14 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. While we don't have many issues on the subreddit that require moderation I do agree with Slayner's point that where the moderator's have failed is doing things to help grow and improve the sub. I think that most of us would agree with all of Slayner's points.   I'm not sure what more we can do to get the mod's attention on these issues. I do think that adding Slayner as a mod would be a good idea from the standpoint that he is a familiar face to the regulars here and he has shown interest in helping the sub to progress. Something that we haven't seen at all from the current mods. We've been complaining about the color scheme for months and months and people have offered to help redo it, yet to my knowledge nothing has been done.   This is on of my favorite subs on reddit and I would really like to see some of the changes proposed by Slayner to see it become even better."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,weaglebeagle,16,Fri Jul 17 12:03:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Agree, agree, agree"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,GiantDeviantPiano,12,Fri Jul 17 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"As far as the sidebar, we could perhaps do a grid of all the artwork of shows currently on the docket, and another of past shows, similar to /r/marvelstudios does with the title cards for films, or like pocketcasts' interface. When you hover over them with your mouse it could either just show a floating name of the show, or if someone's really good with CSS it could fade the artwork dark with an overlay of easy to read title. Obviously clicking on the show will take you to the earwolf page.  As to links apart from the shows that I'd like to see in the sidebar:   FAQ (Even if it's stickied, this is a very common place for people to look) Link to CBB wikia Link to official Earwolf soundcloud page (for people who can't access straight from earwolf.com Maybe a direct link to the Earwolf store?   For sticky-ing, I believe we can sticky two posts at a time right now. So we could have the FAQ as the top sticky, then the second sticky would rotate between the weekly appreciation threads (Sun-Fri) and Free Talk Saturday on Sat.  For AMAs, we could maybe get some of the HH fans that have been on the show as a warm up? I can't get on the earwolf forums from work so I'd love to see more of that spill over to here.  Great sub layouts, that could be used as inspiration:   /r/pcmasterrace has an awesome wiki, with links in the header banner /r/marvelstudios has a great sidebar layout, though I think it could be improved even more (at one point they had some cool mouse-over effects, I'd like to see something like that) Also has a floating nav bar that sticks to the top of the screen and follows you as you scroll, pretty useful! /r/casualconversation has a really solid design from an aesthetic point, I particularly like the circular buttons at the very top of the sidebar... perhaps this could be a permanent link to the weekly appreciation threads?"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,SirPribsy,6,Fri Jul 17 12:03:13 2015 UTC,"Good post -- This mirrors my ideas pretty spot on. A nice clean slick looking sidebar, along with a new theme would be a high priority, and the links you posted look great."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,SirPribsy,3,Fri Jul 17 12:07:12 2015 UTC,I only wish I knew how to do any of that... :D
Earwolf,3dm2gf,arandompurpose,4,Fri Jul 17 12:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well that's why I don't recommend that only I can be considered to be a mod, or that only one person should be a mod.   We could easily bring on someone who is active, and someone else who has CSS experience."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,SirPribsy,3,Fri Jul 17 12:15:42 2015 UTC,"Something like this perhaps?  Edit: Could also thin them out, make them more like slices of the show."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,arandompurpose,3,Fri Jul 17 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"yep! That looks great, it seems like the sidebar doesn't scale depending on resolution, so I think even a 3 column layout could work too, thus not making the rest of the info too far down the page.  Now if there's no fancy CSS hover-over stuff, we might want to keep them big (two-column) so we can read the titles."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,GiantDeviantPiano,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:55:02 2015 UTC,Another example
Earwolf,3dm2gf,SirPribsy,3,Sat Jul 18 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed /r/marvelstudios had a great sidebar, I use that as a reference sometimes, will check out the others later.  My usual Marvel cinema buddies don't want to see And Man -what do I do?"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Fri Jul 17 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"Haha good question, if you need a viewing partner in Western PA, hit me up... otherwise, once you get over the initial ""I'm not used to this"" a solo movie day can be quite fun!"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Fri Jul 17 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"I love a solo movie, just got to find a date"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,requisite_monocle,8,Sat Jul 18 00:00:36 2015 UTC,"I like all of these suggestions! I am going to ask Krampus what he thinks and then we'll go forward from there.  We are definitely mature enough to have open flair options and we should definitely have some AMAs and other special content. I only restricted the flair in the beginning stages of forming the community here because I wanted to test the waters and see how people would behave; as it stands, everyone here behaves superbly and does not need that level of supervision or content guidance. Would anyone be willing to go try to change their flair(Like, input your own into the text box) and let me know if it works properly? It looks to me like it's ready to go, but I want to be sure."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,requisite_monocle,8,Fri Jul 17 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"You're fine, I hope this post didn't come across as aggressive or anything, it's just very often we feel like fish outta the water with the mod situation.   If you would please keep us updated on the points brought up in this post."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,jmg089,5,Fri Jul 17 19:12:38 2015 UTC,Nooo you weren't being aggressive! I understand why people want changes; it's just things that will make it easier to post here and add more content. And we are very overdue for the stuff we need to work on. The problem was that when I brought up that I was getting married(And a belated thank you btw to everyone who gave congratulations!!) I should have mentioned that I was getting married to Krampus..lol. So neither of us were available for a while to work on anything. And if I had been using my head and not been so wrapped up in everything I would have mentioned that specifically. That's all my bad and I'm sorry.
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Catvoca,5,Fri Jul 17 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"No need to be sorry, as I said multiple times personal life issues are much more important, and it definitely sounds like you two have had your hands full. Congrats to the both of you!"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,WeeBabySeamus,3,Fri Jul 17 19:24:31 2015 UTC,Happy Wedding!
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Ciandotmov,6,Sat Jul 18 00:14:33 2015 UTC,"I know /u/Slayner is being nice, but I would still like to see new mods added to /r/Earwolf. I think these recent events have proven that two mods cannot keep up with the demands of this sub, and I believe that extremely active users like /u/Slayner would be great additions to the mod team. If anything so that quick responses can be made instead of hoping that a newly wedded couple will take enough time away from their new lives together to meet the demands of this community.  I really feel like this is an obvious step to meet with the demands of this active and growing community."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,WeeBabySeamus,6,Fri Jul 17 20:19:01 2015 UTC,That is actually what I was getting at when I said I was going to speak to Krampus and then make some changes; adding mods is one of those changes that needs to be made.
Earwolf,3dm2gf,timrulz53,5,Fri Jul 17 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"Awesome! That just wasn't explicitly said, and I though you meant Slayner's own recommendations. I am really looking forward to watching this community grow, and hopefully facilitate it in whatever way I can."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,timrulz53,5,Fri Jul 17 20:53:30 2015 UTC,I clicked on Edit flair. I don't see a text box that lets you input your own?
Earwolf,3dm2gf,TheTank123,5,Fri Jul 17 19:12:41 2015 UTC,Let me sort out what has gone wrong. It has all of the checkboxes checked in the settings to let the users put their own flair in..hmmm.
Earwolf,3dm2gf,TheTank123,6,Fri Jul 17 19:17:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's try that again! :) Flair input should be working; if it's not then something has bugged out somewhere. If you still don't see a text box to put it in, then take a screenshot for me, if you don't mind. It shows up right on my end and all the settings to allow users to put their own flair in are enabled."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,TheTank123,3,Fri Jul 17 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"Works fine Neon, thank you!   Can I direct message you if I have future questions or requests for this sub? May be better than communication through these meta posts."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,requisite_monocle,6,Fri Jul 17 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"No problem! :) And sure, that would be fine. Like I said, we're going to deal with these problems head-on today. I just want to involve Krampus obviously, and he isn't available right now."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,requisite_monocle,2,Fri Jul 17 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"No problem at all, I completely understand. Thank you for responding in this thread, we really appreciate it."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,cryptogrammar,7,Fri Jul 17 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally agree with your post. There's a bunch of small, housekeeping changes like a new sidebar and a new theme that need to be done, and nothings going to happen until there is new/more active mods.   i'm not so sure about getting Earwolf regulars to do AMAs though. I think the community is too small, there probably won't be more then 60 or 70 comments, and at least half will be ""When did you first hear of U2"" and things of that ilk. I think the AMAs comedians do on /r/iama have been just fine. I guess getting the people who are not popular enough to do a main AMA but are well known amongst the Earwolf audience is maybe a good idea (which thinking about it is probably what you are talking about anyway)"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Condawg,4,Fri Jul 17 12:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I'm talking about regarding the AMA's -- Scott and Lauren's recently did just fine, but much smaller fan favorites of earwolf were more my thinking. Maybe a James Adomian, Paul Scheer, Ben Schwartz, Stephanie Allyne? Mary Holland?   Those are a few names off the top of my head where people could ask about the shows they work on, podcasts they appear on, goals they have, UCB experience? comedy experience etc.   It's more of a dream scenario, I don't know if it would work out, and it wouldn't be something to start doing tomorrow or anything but my idea was by using the appreciation threads, people can learn more about said comedian, and we could try and contact said person to schedule an AMA, have that stickied so everyone see's and gets ready for it, then there may be more than like 50 joke-y comments.   Edit: in fact my first idea for an AMA was to contact Engineer Brett on Twitter and ask him to do one here"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Pluppets,3,Fri Jul 17 12:11:53 2015 UTC,"I need to have Ben Schwartz do an AMA. As the creator and moderator of /r/benschwartz (mostly posts from me), I'm obviously a huge fan.   Gemberling and Steph Allyne are also similarly popular in my mind."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Shampoodler,5,Fri Jul 17 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"If you haven't watched Bojack Horseman, he's in the new season."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Shampoodler,3,Fri Jul 17 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"Gabrus, Seth Morris, Kyle Dunnigan, David huntsberger etc, etc.   Even if only 1 outta every 20 reply and do it, there's an endless amount of people to choose from, I think it's absolutely worth trying at least."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,Pluppets,5,Fri Jul 17 13:55:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree. What would be cool is to send them the appreciation threads and to have some questions posed to them for future AMAs so it's not all ""Buthhole"" and ""House of Pies"" jokes.   Actually I would think they would feel good the appreciation thread at some level and that could be cool alone even without an AMA."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,FeaturingPitbull,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:58 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. If I could organize it how I'm picturing it in my head, I can sticky a thread that gives a hub of information on said person scheduled to do an ama, and tell the users on here to keep the joke answers to a minimum because it's a rare opportunity.   This may or may not work out, but that's the point of this thread, spitting out ideas to try and improve the place. And I think that'd be a dream scenario for many people on here."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,SirPribsy,5,Fri Jul 17 14:01:20 2015 UTC,I'd be happy to do an AMA.
Earwolf,3dm2gf,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Fri Jul 17 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"I will get back to you on that Tim, but understand that 99.9% will be asking how the everloving hell you came up with that beautiful song that is constantly stuck in my head"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Sat Jul 18 00:12:11 2015 UTC,Hm yeah honestly daily might be too much but I could do a weekly AMA. We have free talk Friday but we don't have a recurring sticky for Wednesdays do we? How about then?
Earwolf,3dm2gf,requisite_monocle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"You misguided fool, we have a free talk SATURDAY!   but for real though, let's just make wednesday Tim Treece day, I'm all for it. We'll sticky a thread where each week you explain the popcorn gallery to us"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,DanzigMeowMeow,7,Sat Jul 18 01:50:12 2015 UTC,"ZOUKS ZOUKS ZOUKS  Wait, is this another episode of ""Changes To This Subreddit""?"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Fri Jul 17 12:29:06 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking that'd be a great choice for an AMA because he writes a lot and has done a fair share of acting, obviously HDTGM and various other podcast appearances but there's one problem....  He's not on twitter guys.   Edit: wait, did you edit your comment or am I hallucinating? I thought you said something about Zouks"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Fri Jul 17 12:30:33 2015 UTC,"You are not hallucinating at all.  I edited it to add the ""episode of"" and accidentally deleted Zouks.  I have now re added it haha/  He would be a great one to add, but you're right, I'm not sure how one would get him to do it.  Obviously its part of his schtick, but he doesn't seem to be a fan of doing much fan related stuff."
Earwolf,3dm2gf,irmavep,2,Fri Jul 17 12:39:34 2015 UTC,"He's too cool for the social media.   It's whatever though, there's plenty of choices, even down to just learning more about UCB comedy and the effect that podcasts have had on the people that actually perform on them you know?"
Earwolf,3dm2gf,irmavep,3,Fri Jul 17 12:41:24 2015 UTC,I fully agree.  Loving your ideas and enthusiasm!
Earwolf,3dm2gf,CrouchJr,6,Fri Jul 17 12:43:39 2015 UTC,"If you all want to try and make this happen, perhaps we should individually start messaging the mods? If we keep sending them, maybe they will just pay attention long enough for the short-time its takes to make someone (/u/Slayner) a mod"

Earwolf,3dmaja,requisite_monocle,3,Fri Jul 17 12:54:32 2015 UTC,"Bad episode to try and listen to in the library. Could not stop laughing. Matt Gourley and Andy Daly, please do season two of ADPPP soon, you two are comedy gold."
Earwolf,3dmaja,snobbysnob,4,Fri Jul 17 22:54:21 2015 UTC,"Gourley will never pass up an attempt to talk about James Bond, I love it. I was actually hoping Marlowe's accent would basically be the exact same as Ian Fleming's. Maybe throw in some sort of reincarnation bit."

Earwolf,3dln7p,JasonGrayson,14,Fri Jul 17 07:18:33 2015 UTC,I nearly lost it when Melissa started playing Black Betty! This is pure comedy genius.
Earwolf,3dln7p,wandertheearth,14,Fri Jul 17 13:30:39 2015 UTC,I love that Lapkus just can't not laugh at how absurd this all is. So hilarious.
Earwolf,3dln7p,Aquaman_Forever,14,Fri Jul 17 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, was not expecting an Ex Machina inspired episode! I love that Besser does improv based on the films he sees, like the Whiplash I4H episode."
Earwolf,3dln7p,mi-16evil,12,Fri Jul 17 16:05:24 2015 UTC,Yes i have been waiting for Besser to be on. The premise of this ep is probably the best in all of WSGLL.
Earwolf,3dln7p,muddypuddy,9,Fri Jul 17 08:24:07 2015 UTC,"Personally, I still find the T.G.I.G.O.T.G.OST concept to be the most brilliant. Such an incredible parody of all the ""single issue"" podcasts."
Earwolf,3dln7p,credibit,10,Fri Jul 17 10:57:23 2015 UTC,I think i like this one best because it shows what this show can be. It doesnt have to be a Podcast that is being hosted by someone that is not LL. But it can just be an interesting scene  playing out for an hour.
Earwolf,3dln7p,muddypuddy,3,Sat Jul 18 00:56:43 2015 UTC,What is T.G.I.G.O.T.G.OST?
Earwolf,3dln7p,wandertheearth,11,Fri Jul 17 13:29:37 2015 UTC,Thank God Its the Guardians Of The Galaxy Original Sound Track.   The premise of the podcast is that it is episode 80 of a podcast that only discusses that one movie's soundtrack.
Earwolf,3dln7p,credibit,4,Fri Jul 17 13:48:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Somehow I missed that one, I'll fix that right away!"
Earwolf,3dln7p,wandertheearth,3,Fri Jul 17 14:09:57 2015 UTC,Enjoy!
Earwolf,3dln7p,credibit,6,Fri Jul 17 14:45:05 2015 UTC,Also it's a pretty clever parody of UTU2TM (messy acronym and all)
Earwolf,3dln7p,Home-Baked,2,Sun Jul 19 04:54:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant by ""single issue"" ;)"
Earwolf,3dln7p,credibit,9,Sun Jul 19 13:27:07 2015 UTC,"This episode is great. I love this podcast so much. Sometimes because of the premise if the guest isn't great it can cause for a lame episode, but it also can bring us episodes like this. When a great guest comes in, this podcast really is up there with the best comedy podcasts, very happy it exists"
Earwolf,3dln7p,Memphish_Boognish,16,Fri Jul 17 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"I think the weirdest thing about WSG is that it really separates the amateurs from the pros. Perhaps it is because in other podcasts they can lean on one another a bit more, but in WSG they get no help from Lapkus (because she almost never plays the staright man). This episode exemeplified that (because Besser is king and of course he can pull off high-concept improv and still make it hilarious)"
Earwolf,3dln7p,requisite_monocle,8,Fri Jul 17 17:01:47 2015 UTC,Agreed 100%

Earwolf,3dmm7q,Slayner,11,Fri Jul 17 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"Annie Hall did win best picture.   Edit: It's actually pretty egregious that Howard didn't know this, considering the movie it beat out was the end all be all of crazy make em ups... Star Wars!

Very cool of Kyle to give credit for the germ of the tangent, but I bet he's being overly humble.

Earwolf,3dhthr,jarjarwang,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:12:16 2015 UTC,How dare you not like something other people like? The nerve. Glad Reddit can show you how wrong you are in your comedy preferences by downvoting you.
Earwolf,3dhthr,JustinPA,7,Fri Jul 17 00:42:36 2015 UTC,"People might be downvoting just because it's a little rude to entirely write someone off because of the sound of their voice... I don't know, I don't really get involved with downvoting but that's my guess.  It's not really fair to judge someone for something they can't help, like the sound of their voice."

Is this new found knowledge that U2 and their cronies know of and potentially listen to the p'cast gonna effect the raw, unadulterated thoughts they currently broadcast about the band? Will this new corporate and celebrity-full lifestyle result in a new atmosphere for the p'cast? Will the boys become too big of a big boy?"

Earwolf,3dcx0s,Aroniousj,6,Wed Jul 15 18:16:40 2015 UTC,Adam would need some sort of breakout role. Gavin hasn't done anything major in a while (it's been awhile) but for about a year he was a mega rockstar.
Earwolf,3dcx0s,Condawg,7,Wed Jul 15 22:27:21 2015 UTC,Listened to this one with my 6 year old over lunch. Both crying laughing when Scott's said to take that popcorn and shove it up your butt. Amazing stuff!

This video is the highlight of my week. I gotta say, that Best Ash Costume Contest made me cringe so hard. Still pretty hilarious though.  I think it's funny that, despite running a 350+ episode podcast and a four-season TV show, you can still clearly tell that Scott is nervous. Its cute! He must really love the Evil Dead series!"
Earwolf,3deu9z,angelfromthecoast,16,Wed Jul 15 18:44:44 2015 UTC,Yeah Harris loved joking about that kind of thing. :( On F&P4 that clip of him being in heaven made me smile fondly.
Earwolf,3deu9z,nyan_swanson,13,Wed Jul 15 19:00:36 2015 UTC,Imagine being a podcast fan five or ten years from now. You're going through old episodes of CBB and UTU2TM and they sometimes talk about Harris dying and everyone laughs. Sometimes they talk about it and they're very somber. Sometimes it's just uncomfortable laughter. And sometimes Harris is there! It'll make a hell of a puzzle to sort out.
Earwolf,3deu9z,thommmmm,-14,Wed Jul 15 22:25:06 2015 UTC,It's almost like human grief is complex
Earwolf,3deu9z,novation123,3,Thu Jul 16 00:43:45 2015 UTC,More like they joked about him dying when he was alive and then became serious after he actually died.

Earwolf,3deu9z,novation123,15,Thu Jul 16 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"I think the worst ""Oh fuck that's bad in hindsight"" moment is in the last Analyze Phish episode where Mike Hanford says ""Well you can always just do drugs again, right?"". Obviously a joke (and a funny one at the time) but damn, man."
Earwolf,3deu9z,Treeducks,2,Wed Jul 15 19:18:04 2015 UTC,just listened to this ep today and scott tells harris that he gets too anxious and thats why he should be on drugs which makes me feels the same way. but i also thought about how that was probably a serious issue in harris's life that he didn't know how to deal with in a healthy way :/
Earwolf,3deu9z,potatohead3,7,Wed Jul 15 23:34:06 2015 UTC,I didn't start listening to UTU2TM or Analyze Phish until after Harris died and there were quite a few moments that were tough to listen to.
Earwolf,3deu9z,kbk88,5,Wed Jul 15 21:19:04 2015 UTC,It took me a moment to realize that was recorded before he died so I just thought they were being really dark.
Earwolf,3deu9z,TheAlexBasso,5,Wed Jul 15 22:35:59 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, there WAS a moment where you thought those episodes were recorded... AFTER he died?"
Earwolf,3deu9z,ChalkdustOnline,2,Fri Jul 17 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"Just the UTU2TM one. Nothing with Harris, obviously."
Earwolf,3deu9z,TheAlexBasso,10,Fri Jul 17 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"Most of the podcasts Harris was on have some pretty dark moments that are made uncomfortable by his passing.  Hell, I cringe every time he's convinced that Abe Vigoda is dead on Getting Doug with High."
Earwolf,3deu9z,irishstevenj,5,Wed Jul 15 19:03:07 2015 UTC,I think he'd laugh at it honestly
Earwolf,3deu9z,8eat-mesa,4,Wed Jul 15 23:53:58 2015 UTC,"I was listening to his episode on Ronna and Beverly, and they were all talking about where they see him in a few years, if he's married, will he have kids. It was rough to listen to."

Earwolf,3ddwgx,Prax150,11,Wed Jul 15 14:42:40 2015 UTC,Finally DVK gets some attention on another Earwolf podcast. He is vastly under appreciated.
Earwolf,3ddwgx,Michael__Pemulis,5,Wed Jul 15 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. I'd love to hear him on CBB as well. I absolutely love DVK. I still enjoy the Sklar Brothers, but the 'County' episodes of Sklarbro Country are the only ones I really look forward to anymore."
Earwolf,3ddwgx,starthirteen,2,Wed Jul 15 15:51:07 2015 UTC,I'm with you on county over country. It is odd that DVK hasn't appeared on cbb yet. Especially since he is so beloved on dlm where he gets virtually no promotion.
Earwolf,3ddwgx,Michael__Pemulis,5,Wed Jul 15 15:56:33 2015 UTC,An entourage ep with Scott talking to Mark Wahlberg would be such a good episode.   The homeless Steven Seagal would also fit well into CBB Canon. It's definitely surprising a good character creator like DVK hasn't ended up there yet where he could go full craziness.

Earwolf,3ddz4a,irishstevenj,6,Wed Jul 15 16:42:57 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily a show that drives much online engagement because of its format, and because Horatio has his friends on the show instead of big-name guests. They also didn't really do great at live episodes. So the show relies entirely on whether you connect with Rog and Chad's sense of humor.  But I did, so I really hope the show goes on."
Earwolf,3ddz4a,sloof70,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that live show was grim. They do best in the basement, doing skits and chatting with friends, edited. I could hear Cosby call in and talk about the drinky-drinky and the rapey-rapey all day long."

Earwolf,3ddz4a,dnmty,4,Wed Jul 15 20:40:53 2015 UTC,"I certainly hope so. I also hope that this isn't a Jerry Minor/Brett Gelman situation where Horatio cuts most/all ties with Earwolf, however unlikely it may be."
Earwolf,3ddz4a,sloof70,6,Wed Jul 15 20:50:23 2015 UTC,That's what I'm fearing. Because Horatio is one of my favorite Earwolf regulars. I didn't even want to mention that possibility.
Earwolf,3ddz4a,sourmilksmell,3,Wed Jul 15 20:53:25 2015 UTC,Why did Gelman cut ties with Earwolf?
Earwolf,3ddz4a,clamsPIANOS,6,Fri Jul 17 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"Seems like they might be able to get a better cut of ad rev by going elsewhere. If the boys were already doing everything in-house, then there wouldn't be much use for earwolf outside the launch of the show.

Earwolf,3d9wgd,apaulg,7,Tue Jul 14 20:16:05 2015 UTC,I don't know if she's done with PB or something is going on with her in general. Have you listened to her appearance on CBB? It seems like across the board she is lacking her usual wit and pizazz.
Earwolf,3d9wgd,brentweinbach,5,Wed Jul 15 04:32:05 2015 UTC,That's true too. She could just be exhausted. She has so much going on and I know she had more health complications recently.   Didn't she mention on one of the recent eps when she was on the phone that she didn't know how long she'd be able to continue the podcast? Maybe I'm remembering something incorrectly?
Earwolf,3d9wgd,apaulg,4,Wed Jul 15 04:54:24 2015 UTC,"She definitely did. I was hoping when I heard her say that, that she was just recovering and not feeling well and didn't really mean it. It seems like the podcast brings all three of them so much joy that I hate to see it end or change."
Earwolf,3d9wgd,brentweinbach,3,Wed Jul 15 05:08:41 2015 UTC,Yeah for me it's all about Tig and Sweetie.
Earwolf,3d9wgd,samantha-mulder,11,Wed Jul 15 04:03:47 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree. I love Tig. I see her live whenever I can, have her albums. But, I noticed when making my best of list that she wasn't in two of the eps I picked. Kyle and Judy, hilarious. David and the Canadians, hilarious. I'm glad she's happy and doing well, but I would love a David+Kyle podcast. Or a solo Kyle. Or Kyle+Judy."
Earwolf,3d9wgd,Cantkillabullmoose,4,Tue Jul 14 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"Kyle Judy, can you imagine?"
Earwolf,3d9wgd,Slayner,22,Tue Jul 14 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"When this subject last came up I was pretty surprised to find out that not as many people revere Tig as you might think. I was a bigger fan of hers three or four years ago than I am now. Although her latest CBB appearance was pretty good. Anyway she kind of gets on my nerves with her insistence to step on bits, and her kind of intentional indifference toward the show. For instance in the loneliness episode, the guest was on a roll talking about relevant stuff with D&K and Tig insisted on repeatedly bringing up the imaginary penguin friend from childhood. Not funny, badly timed, clunky and intrusive... not to mention Tig didn't even have the name right.  Anyway I am glad for Tig's fame and continued success in her career, and I feel bad every time I read she's in the hospital again. But honestly the only reason I continue listening to PB is Kyle. He's so funny. Kyle and David make a decent team, I agree, and I'd be happy enough if it was the two of them just running the show. I feel like it's inevitable - either that or the show just stops because David is apparently really busy too with Reactor. Of course in an ideal world that would allow Kyle to start his own solo show, but who knows what will happen. He seems a little too flaky to do a show on his own."
Earwolf,3d9wgd,pdxsean,4,Tue Jul 14 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"Was the mention of the penguin the same episode as the woman who claimed to be leading a lonely life? I thought she was doing that to distract David, because he was beginning to pick at the guest's veracity. (I could be wrong, I listen during work, so I slip back and forth thru passive listening.)"
Earwolf,3d9wgd,sourmilksmell,7,Tue Jul 14 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"I do remember David being kind of annoying there... as if the suggestion that only living the Unabomber lifestyle makes one a loner. I have a full-time job that involves customer service, but I am absolutely a loner. Being a loner doesn't mean you can't function in society, it means more that you like to be alone more often than not when given a chance.    Anyway that may have been the case at one point, I know she interjected a few times with the penguin thing. One of them stands out in my mind tho because I felt like the guest, David, and Kyle had developed a good conversation and Tig interrupted with the imaginary friend, even after the guest had (to me anyway) made it clear she didn't really want to go down that road.    Then again I read a lot into the subtext of podcasts."
Earwolf,3d9wgd,pdxsean,15,Wed Jul 15 00:06:22 2015 UTC,"Tig has been (literally and figuratively) phoning it in for awhile now. She's busy promoting her new documentary, doing other projects, been sick. I understand why she can't be there, but even when she is, it doesn't feel like she's at all interested. I don't feel like she has any real interest in the subject matter of PB, which... kind of defeats the purpose.   David is definitely the one holding things together and Kyle is almost everything funny about the show."
Earwolf,3d9wgd,totallynotabear,5,Tue Jul 14 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's how I feel too. When she was in studio for a bit last week she seemed extremely disinterested and even kind of dismissive. When David brought up Inside Out being amazing, she talked about how someone said it perpetrated negative body stereotypes or something (which is insane). She just doesn't seem too interested in the podcast anymore."
Earwolf,3d9wgd,liam-t,5,Tue Jul 14 22:08:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind Professor Blastoff coming to an end to be honest. I've listened from episode 1 but over the past few months I've had trouble finding enthusiasm to listen and usually leave it to the weekend unlike the other podcasts that I need to listen to on the day of release.   I'd rather see the show go out strong and maybe Kyle and David could launch a new show?
Earwolf,3d9wgd,Slayner,11,Thu Jul 16 03:55:48 2015 UTC,"I actually agree, was thinking the same thing recently. I think tig has too much going on for PB and David and Kyle make a solid duo anyway.  Not to say tig shouldn't be on, but if she needs to leave I'd be fine with it staying as Kyle and David"
Earwolf,3d9wgd,brentweinbach,4,Tue Jul 14 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"It seems Tig is loosing interest in the podcast which is sad, she will be greatly missed if she leaves. I feel like podcasts are an equal form of entertainment to movies and tv. If she does leave she will be loosing many fans and a weekly outlet to talk and hang with friends. Although, she doesn't get paid for doing it so you can't blame her. But she will be missed."
Earwolf,3d9wgd,brys0n0syrb,3,Wed Jul 15 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tig. If you're going to do something anyway, at least try to have fun, and not pretend you're being forced into it. Unfortunately that would require making things awkward with David, who constantly prompts Tig to speak on things she has already lost interest on. ""Come on Tig, you still care dontcha?"" ""No, but I'll just imply that,""  ""I knew you cared""  ""Welp, that's been podcast"""
Earwolf,3d9wgd,pettycoat,3,Thu Jul 16 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"I agree that PB has some serious issues, but I don't think the solution is for Tig to leave. I would rather the show just end as it seems to have run its course. If Tig left, I think David and Kyle would end up in the unfortunate position of trying to hang onto listeners and things would probably become even more tired and forced until it all dissolved. I'd rather see them put together an exit strategy. Try and line up some really good guests with solid topics and maybe even a little more Professor mythology to explain that the hatch will soon be closed.

Earwolf,3d88sp,philipstyrer,9,Tue Jul 14 17:29:49 2015 UTC,"That's not really their game... Sean and Hayes know that the only reason they are still a podcast is because of the rabid fans they have developed. As Scott has spoken about in past AMAs. They aren't about to marginalize a portion of that fan base.   I guess you can interpret it how you want, but I thought it was funny and I appreciated the acknowledgement (also while Sean and Hayes haven't been on the forums explicitly, there is a good deal of crossover between the forums and this subreddit. It's not like either have been mutually exclusive)"

Earwolf,3d88sp,philipstyrer,6,Tue Jul 14 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the difference, people who post on the forums post here and vice versa.

You're welcome to your opinion, I'm not downvoting you idk who is, but I think you're wrong here.   Hayes and Sean may find certain things annoying here, but I doubt it's anything serious to where you gotta look at it as a negative shoutout.

But the forums are entirely different from the subreddit.  I'm sure we are very much appreciated as fans, but the conversations here are almost always just repeated old bits, like you pointed out.  And I'm sure you expected to be downvoted for that opinion, because this is the sub that is being poked at.  We're all fans, no matter what online forum you participate in, but one group get chosen to do a live in studio episode, and one group got a light hearted jab in the ribs.  It's all good.   It's like we are commenting on the show and the comedy here, but on the forums they are sort of producing their own comedy, not just commenting on it."

Earwolf,3d6tnd,spikey666,8,Tue Jul 14 03:12:30 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, because  Jerry Minor did show up on the TV show. My guess is he just doesn't like the way Earwolf does business.  It's not the only time I've heard of Earwolf being overzealous in that way. They had some similar problems with Nerd Poker too (but they got it worked out after a couple months). It's a shame. Cyber Thug was a highlight of early CDR. It was an interesting choice for the first spin-off."

Also a lot of the Tom and Andy lines sound Harris-like. I'm sure that whole writing room fed off Harris' vibes though.
Earwolf,3d6yhc,requisite_monocle,12,Tue Jul 14 00:26:48 2015 UTC,"HM) I4H 187 Wild Horses III - Gossipy Elephants  Giving this one a S/O because it wasn't the best episode of I4H, but the Disney scenes at the end may have been my all-time favorite I4H scenes.  10.) WSGLL: Scott Aukerman: A Lil' Dab'll Do Ya'  Goofy Scott is my favorite Scott (rivaled closely by irritated Scott), and I don't think Scott gets much goofier than when he knows he is doing shitty character work. Plus, I love Scott's love for Regina Crimp (and love her myself). This was an ep that I relistened to almost immediately, if only to get Regina's rendition of the AFV theme out of my head.  9.) HH: Kumail Nanjiani, Our Close Friend  Perhaps the reason I am so obsessed with Earwolf this year is that I finally found HH. I didn't like the intro that much, but the interview more than made up for it. Sean and Hayes trying to get people to saying things always has me bussin' up.  8.) CBB: 338 Be My Guest, Literally!   An automatic favorite. Two-beloved characters, a lesser known one from the best in the business, and a wonderful script reading for Nosferatu.  7.) WSGLL: T.G.I.G.O.T.G OST with Sean Clements and Hayes Davenport  This would be included almost for the fact that this was what finally got me into Hollywood Handbook. With the added fact that it was a spot-on parody of the UTU2TM endlessly delighted me. I think if this came out last year, this episode may be much higher.  6.) SPONT: 4 Savannah, Georgia  I am a big defender of Spont on this subreddit and my go-to piece of evidence is this episode. It made Sarah Burns an instant favorite of mine in the way she haphazardly threw so many wrenches in the perceived plan of the other improvisers. Watching them work through her insanity was so amazingly hilarious, and led to some really memorable bits (the many deaths of Jesus Christ was a real highlight for me).  5.) CBB: 349 The 6th Anniversary Show!  Drums!  4.) HH: Mary Holland, Our Close Friend  For those in the scoop troop, we each have our own experience with how HH became solidified as the greatest podcast in all the land. It was heading that way through my entire binge listen, but when this episode came out, that was where it finally hit the stratosphere.  3.) I4H: 4/20 Special: Clit's Alive  It was going to be hard for I4H to live up to the rambling masterclass of improv that was the first 4/20 special, but the second did it in spades. Somehow, in someway, this special was less hilarious high extrapolations and more hilariously insane high scenarios. I don't know quite how to describe the difference, but anyone who has been high enough times knows that these two episodes exemplified two different sets of intoxicated humor.  2.) CBB: 351 CBB: The Movie  It lived up to the hype. I don't know how, but Sean and Hayes managed to out-Sean-and-Hayes themselves and it was glorious to behold.  1.) WSGLL: The Tom Leykis Radio Program  I listened to this episode every other day the month it came out. I never do that with podcasts, but I have never listened to such an instant classic. Listening to this episode the Friday it came out, must have been how people felt listening to ADPPP before the hype. Everything about this episode was perfect. It's the culmination of Adomian's pitch-perfect impression and it was front-to-back hilarious. From the first seconds, to the Earwolf theme... I may need to give it another relisten now. I am overdue for some overlong siren noises.  This has already been an amazing year for podcasts, and I mainly wanted to do this so I can already look back and see the litany of amazing content I have been provided for free over these past few months. Thanks Earwolf!"

I'm a huge Hollywood Handbook fanboy and there are about 10 eps this year alone that I could list along with their CBB episode.

However, no one has mentioned probably my 2nd or maybe favorite CBB episode of the year: the Nick Kroll and John Mulaney episode.  Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland just make me buss up so hard no matter what they say and I was pretty much laughing nonstop during that ep."

But yeah, the Moffat era kind of makes me groan sometimes. I want Capaldi to get a chance with someone else at the helm for a season or two but I don't think that's going to happen.  I'm also holding out hope that the next Doctor is a woman or an Irishman. :P"

Basically may the best (wo)man win type of deal"
Earwolf,3cwmha,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Sat Jul 11 16:42:28 2015 UTC,Matt will probably always be my favorite Doctor but Capaldi nailed his first series. I appreciate what the Moff has done for the show but I'd like to see someone new maybe after this series.

Earwolf,3cwmha,japanesepagoda,2,Sat Jul 11 18:09:04 2015 UTC,"I know that was on the ep when I listened to all of them awhile ago, but that was before Harris. Maybe they've gone back and cut it out since?"
Earwolf,3cwmha,Codeo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but they leave way worse stuff in there (Harris talks about doing oxys) so I don't think that's the reason. They could have cut it because Scott was embarrassed or something, but that doesn't seem likely either.  But thank you for confirming that I'm not insane (yet). That's almost worth it on it's own."
Earwolf,3cwmha,japanesepagoda,4,Sat Jul 11 20:11:15 2015 UTC,Seeing Spontaneanation live tonight! This is gonna be the first time I've seen Hot Saucerman in person.

Earwolf,3cwmha,oshoney,7,Sun Jul 12 00:19:04 2015 UTC,Your wish is my command. I didn't know they were going to be doing a meet and greet after and I am still freaking out. I can talk more about the show if you want!
Earwolf,3cwmha,Pluppets,4,Sun Jul 12 07:43:47 2015 UTC,"Tell me everything. I'm so stupidly excited for you, this is amazing. I think out of every person I'd like to meet in my life you just met them in one night.   Dude. Djdnsmsmmajaahhaejdjddj fuck. Agh. Fuck. Dammit! Agh!!! Ahhhhhh"
Earwolf,3cwmha,Pluppets,9,Sun Jul 12 09:46:46 2015 UTC,"Ok! I'll tell the whole story. Spoiler alert!  First of all, it was a taping that will air in the fall, so you'll be able to listen to it then. Scott was the interviewee. The improvisers were Chris Tallman, Amanda Lund, and Matt Gourley. However, Scott also improvised the story, which is apparently something they do at the live tapings.   Paul was in rare form right off the bat. Seeing his rambling monologue live enhances the experience so much. His theatrical gestures were hilarious.   Then he introduced each of the improvisers and joked around with them for a bit. Matt and Amanda were both very charming, and they seem like a great couple. Chris Tallman told a crazy story about almost getting arrested in college because of a toy gun he got for theater class.  Then came Scott's interview. Seeing Scott and Paul riff live was amazing. They were talking about how they had known each other for 20 years, and you could really tell. Paul asked the question that they previous guest had left for Scott, and wouldn't you know it, Scott dragged out answering the question, Would-You-Rather style. You could tell it was slightly annoying Paul, because they had a limited amount of time. He had set up a clock on an iPad stand across from him that counted down 20 minutes, and once it ended he wrapped up the interview fairly quickly. Overall it was a real treat to watch.  After that, during the ""commercial break,"" they did a special treat for the live audience that won't end up in the recording. Scott and Paul did a song and dance routine to The Smith's ""Ask."" They messed up halfway and had to start over. It was super fun.  Then came the improv. It was fantastic, but very visual. Some of the best parts of the show will be confusing or just won't translate at all to the listener, such as Matt carrying Amanda and running off, both of them flipping the bird to the people they just kicked with poison boots. However, I'm sure that won't ruin the listening experience; it was great to see Scott do improv, his style was slightly meta and anarchic, similar to his appearance on the ADPPP.  After the show there was a meet and greet with everybody from the show, which I did not find out about until during the show. Needless to say I was very nervous. It's strange to meet people who you've listened to for hours on end. However, it turned out to be one of the best meet and greet experiences I've ever had.   First I talked to Chris Tallman. I'm not super familiar with his work outside of Spont and Superego, but he asked me some questions, and we ended up chatting about how much we like Scott and Paul's rapport like we were two fans. It was great. Then I talked to Amanda and Matt. They were both very nice. I told Matt about how much I enjoyed Superego and his character Mahi from the Hot Dog episode of the ADPPP. He was very grateful and characteristically charming.   Next I met Hot Saucerman. I told him how his podcast basically got me into the comedy scene. He asked me how old I was. I said I was 16, and he said that was the perfect age to be getting into comedy. Then I met Paul. I told him how I went to the last Varietopia show he did, and how it landed on my birthday. I started talking about the show with both of them. I told them about how funny it was that Scott was dragging out the question, especially because I could see the clock onstage and he was taking up a lot of time. Paul then said that he was trying to set the clock up so that the audience wouldn't see it, because it would stress them out (it kind of did). Everyone was so nice.  I might be writing a lot, but the point I'm trying to make is that it wasn't just a quick hello, we had about a two minute conversation. It was awesome, and they were nice enough to spend that much time with everyone. At one point I told Scott and Paul that I could listen to the two of them talk forever, and Paul said I got to do that tonight. I said that it really felt like forever, and then Scott pretended he was offended. I did a bit with Scott! I'm still excited, and I still am in disbelief. Overall it was an amazing show, an amazing night, and I got a great picture out of it. Sorry if I wrote too much, I just had a feeling you all would want to hear a lot about it."
Earwolf,3cwmha,thelostdolphin,6,Sun Jul 12 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"That's great! I didn't realise Scott would be improvising too.   They say don't meet your heroes, but luckily your heroes were like the first season of Heroes and not the later seasons."

I doubt any podcast under that umbrella has pressure to conform to any standard, you can say and do whatever you want if it's funny."
Earwolf,3cvxa1,Catvoca,7,Sat Jul 11 07:19:28 2015 UTC,"I know Earwolf doesn't limit ideas, but I think OP was saying that Sean and Hayes may be more hesitant to make fun of big celebrities if their podcast was mega popular."

Earwolf,3cvxa1,ksaid1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:40:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah if we're talking about ""making fun of other podcasts on the Earwolf network"" there is an episode of I4H where they straight-up played a clip from Yo Is This Racist and basically ripped it apart.    I forget what episode it was, but I remember the YITR clip was Andrew Ti and his guests talking about how when sitcoms have racist stereotype jokes, the writers shouldn't be blamed, we should blame ""the idiots who watch the show in places like Illinois, who have never met black people"". Matt made it very clear that he found that idea (blaming the audience for your own racism) completely disgusting.  When I heard that I4H segment, I pretty much decided that I was never going to listen to YITR."

Earwolf,3cvxa1,Slayner,6,Sat Jul 11 12:05:40 2015 UTC,I don't know if there's such a thing as overrated in comedy. People like what they like and don't like what they don't like.
Earwolf,3cvxa1,culiseta,8,Sat Jul 11 12:12:24 2015 UTC,"Read an interview with Hannibal Buress where he quoted Leno (of all people), who said, on the subject of comedy being subjective, ""If somebody tells you they think you're funny, they're right. If somebody tells you they think you're not funny, they're also right."""
Earwolf,3cvxa1,Slayner,3,Sat Jul 11 12:18:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a perfect quote. I never hate on someone for not liking Hayes and Sean, I can see why plenty of people wouldn't be into it, but they just strike gold with me particularly every time.   Just like I know plenty of people love things I wasn't super into. No big deal either way"
Earwolf,3cvxa1,culiseta,-13,Sat Jul 11 12:32:58 2015 UTC,"It's my option that the fundamental comedic skill and talent of these two is low, especially by comparison to rest of the Earwolf roster. They have great moments but not much else for me. They are green and will improve. At this point I'm bailing in favor of more consistently stelar work from PFT, Adomian, Daly, etc.    Is everything on earwolf great? No. Is the variety of choices great? Indeed. Is this just a ciclejerk subreddit? I'm not sure anymore."
Earwolf,3cvxa1,Slayner,7,Sat Jul 11 12:21:12 2015 UTC,"I absolutely disagree about this being a circlejerk of a subreddit. I'm constantly impressed by the reasonable discussions on here. I'm not bashing you for not liking them, plenty of users don't. And they have every right not to like them.   HH is my favorite podcast, and I think Sean in-particular is phenomenal at improv, but I don't recommend Hollywood Handbook to everyone, because I can easily admit that it's not for everyone.   HH is a podcast you hear about very frequently on here, because it's a cult hit. Therefore the small amount of listeners are much much more vocal. But to throw out a couple of examples on the other side of the spectrum, I don't like Never Not Funny at all, and that's a less vocal, yet insanely more popular podcast.   You're welcome to disagree with it, I wasn't trying to bash you for your opinion, but I couldn't disagree more about the state of this subreddit."
Earwolf,3cvxa1,culiseta,-1,Sat Jul 11 12:29:00 2015 UTC,"Most is reasonable and devoid of any criticism, which is my observation of the sub's direction and concern about it. It's a big love in, and may subs are.   We're having a healthy disagreement, but it's all good because there's tons more that unites Earwolf fans than divides us."
Earwolf,3cvxa1,culiseta,3,Sat Jul 11 12:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I gotcha, but I sincerely would say a good 75% of users on here share my opinion. I wouldn't worry about the subs direction, I've been here since we had like 1500 subscribers, and surprisingly with the more users usually the worse a sub gets, but with this one it's only gotten better.   So long as people discuss podcasts and don't bash on others for not liking what they like I'd say we're all good."

Earwolf,3crw4l,sevillianrites,4,Fri Jul 10 07:26:18 2015 UTC,This was a good episode. It was getting a bit lackluster. But this episode picked it up. Zoe plays the defeated host perfectly.
Earwolf,3crw4l,POZZD,7,Fri Jul 10 12:23:50 2015 UTC,"It's really, really hard to hold down an hour and fifteen minutes with just two characters. That said, there are so many brilliant eps of this podcast it is criminal:  Sean and Hayes  PFT as Santa  Benny Schwaz  Nick Kroll  The Wild Horses one (two, actually)  Marry Holland and Jessica St Clair  JAMES ADOMIAN on Leykis 101 (FUCKING brilliant)  Tom Middleditch (holy shit., As I have said before, Tom/Lapkus/Daly/PFT/Adomian are the overlords of this medium)  I can imagine it's hard to garner multiple guests every week when you aren't as established as Aukerman. THEN you have a guy like Andy Daly who can basically weave straw into gold. I love to think of what the future will hold in five years when new comics, UCB grads, etc start to filter in."
Earwolf,3crw4l,gerradp,2,Fri Jul 10 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"I wonder if she'll switch to a three-person format if the show becomes more popular.  Even great guests like Daly seem to be a bit off their best when it's just two people.  There's no chance to sit back when you don't have something good to say, and arguably there's less character fodder in raw terms."
Earwolf,3crw4l,FugitiveDribbling,2,Sat Jul 11 00:03:02 2015 UTC,"Good list, I would like to add Joe Wengert to it please"
Earwolf,3crw4l,nohorseman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"I kinda wonder what the process is for this show. On CBB some improvisers seem to do some pre-show notes and I've seen images where some will have notebooks or just a page of notes that maybe they take as they go.(one of the Horatio episodes you can see his basic notes in a picture.) I would assume it's the same for this show but honestly, there have been some episodes that felt like the guest only had a twinge of an idea and it never really fleshes out through the improv.(Hey, I'm sure it's difficult already to improvise but also lead a whole show of a fake podcast) Some people can probably pull that off while others may need more prep.  Anyway, I don't know where I'm going with this. I'd be interested in more behind the scenes details and how much planning is ever done pre-show."
Earwolf,3crw4l,TvsPhil,3,Fri Jul 10 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Lapkus has said that she doesn't know who she is going to be. The ""host"" makes it up on the spot and the show flows how they take it. Kind of like spontaneanation."
Earwolf,3crw4l,POZZD,3,Fri Jul 10 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking this same thing! I thought this was one of the strongest episodes with an unestablished ""host"" (not that big of a surprise though because Zoe was great on HH)"
Earwolf,3cqv9o,Slayner,9,Fri Jul 10 01:20:47 2015 UTC,"I started listening to the pod around christmas time of 2014 by hearing the best of 2014 with PFT. Aside from devouring the podcast, I began catching up on the show via netflix.   I think I will go out of order and check this episode, cause I am so darn curious what Scott and Scott's chemistry will be like. Are they allowed to re-use the two scott thing from UTU2TM?"
Earwolf,3cqv9o,funnyhowthings,7,Fri Jul 10 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"Fuck it why not?   And anyway, I don't think you'll be any lost or anything, the show has next to no continuity. All you really gotta know is Reggie left in the episode previous and I imagine you'll be good to go."
Earwolf,3cqv9o,coitusFelcher,3,Fri Jul 10 01:45:36 2015 UTC,"Their chemistry is great on the show, but it's part improv, part scripted so you kinda lose the raw charm of them just sitting together shooting the shit and making each other laugh."
Earwolf,3cqv9o,Cantkillabullmoose,7,Fri Jul 10 07:22:05 2015 UTC,"I am watching on sling tv so I think I'm on a little delay, but very excited!  Edit:  What are you in the habit of? Did you see sister act 2? Back in the habit.   I could feel that Scotty auks joke coming from a mile away! But I still loved it."
Earwolf,3cqv9o,apaulg,7,Fri Jul 10 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"I'm super late to the game here but I had to wait until it came out on Amazon to watch. I think it's going to be great! The writers probably are still feeling out Cudi's style.   One thing is that I don't think his musical role should try to emulate Reggie's. Reggie was known for improvised beats, Cudi is known more for rapping and is a particularly good freestyler. I wonder if they incorporated that element it would be a little more unique?"
Earwolf,3cqv9o,NotfromFresno,8,Fri Jul 10 16:55:24 2015 UTC,"This episode is good, but I think next week will be more indicative of what the Kid Cudi era will be like.  Once Scott warms up to Cudi we'll see what their chemistry is like.  Edit: Comic books video games, possible nod to HH?  Edit 2: Great ep!  I give it a C+!"

Earwolf,3co4ly,Slayner,26,Thu Jul 9 12:51:06 2015 UTC,"Oh boy! too many to name. I would recommend searching through the backlog for comedians you really enjoy.   Some episodes can get very hectic and lots of inside jokes, so it's hard to recommend to you my favorite.   http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/  Some very good comedians that are almost always a safe bet are   Lauren Lapkus, Paul F Tompkins, James Adomian, and Andy Daly.   Thing you gotta know about CBB is it's a character based improv comedy podcast, so expect things to get super silly.   Also, try the search bar here for some of the communities recommended episodes, I'm sure you can find some stuff.   Best of luck, if you're into it that'd be great, always happy to have more podcast fans here!"
Earwolf,3co4ly,Drogalov,16,Thu Jul 9 13:01:24 2015 UTC,"I saw there have been some great names on the show so that shall definitely give me a decent place to start.   Thanks for the link I shall have a look once I knock off from work, I'll start with some of the people I have heard of and then I'll have a look at some of the names you have mentioned. That's what comedy is about isn't it? Being able to be silly to hopefully get a chuckle out of someone? It sounds like my sort of comedy anyway.  Thanks for your time and reply buddy, I appreciate it."
Earwolf,3co4ly,Drogalov,10,Thu Jul 9 13:44:27 2015 UTC,Some get a downright weird too. Check out the past couple with Thomas Middleditch too. He's only been on a couple of times but is already a firm fan favourite

But I would suggest the Farts and Procreation series, the Time Bobby trilogy, and you can't go wrong by looking up some of your favorite guests, Harris Wittels, Paul F. Thompkins, Lauren Lapkus, Matt Besser, Seth Morris and Adam Scott a few of my favorites. Edit, oh and for a while I looked up every episode that played would you rather, cause it's my favorite game.

Earwolf,3co4ly,mattallurgist,2,Fri Jul 10 01:41:09 2015 UTC,"It's not that nothing since 260 is good enough; when I originally made the list ('sbeenawhile) I had to make a lot of tough cuts in order to distill the most ""essential"" episodes (ie the ones that introduce the most major guests and characters). This meant a lot of great recent/more-standalone eps had to go. Honestly, trying to narrow it down to ten was probably too constrictive in the first place...  Aaah, what the hell. Here's a bonus list of ten essential eps from the last hundo.  263- Hollywild  265- Live From RIOT LA  266- The Calvins Twins  289- The Exorcism of Cake Boss  297- Canadian Apparel  309- Tony Macaroni  312- Grounded Me@  342- A Silicon Valley P-Cast  349- The 6th Anniversary Show!  355- Kid Detectives  EDIT: Oops, had to tweak the list a bit (and clean up some poor grammar)."
Earwolf,3co4ly,SpentThatOnANecklace,2,Fri Jul 10 03:54:38 2015 UTC,It's a tough pro po (proposition) to distill 360+ episodes down to ten. Two good lists though. Although I re listened to 351 with Hayes and Sean lady night and it blew my mind how funny that was again

Earwolf,3co4ly,sevillianrites,4,Thu Jul 9 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"Comedy Bang! Bang! isn't really a disussion podcast. Earwolf, the podcast network that CBB is the face of, has the motto: ""We don't talk about comedy, we create it"". In almost every podcast, there is a comedian playing a character. These characters include real famous people such as Cake Boss, Jesse Ventura, and Ice-T, as well as characters created by the comedian such as fan favourites Don Dimello (theater director) and Jack Sjunior (lumber yard owner)."

Earwolf,3co4ly,oshoney,4,Thu Jul 9 16:31:07 2015 UTC,Is listen to one of the Best Of episodes they release every year.  It gives you a taste of what the show is like and includes some great clips.

It's easy to get lost or bogged down in eps that are either too self referential or have a guest that was unexpectedly weak. With Best Ofs, you're guaranteed the most accessible(ish), highest quality shit."
Earwolf,3co4ly,shaky_but_nice,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:40:50 2015 UTC,I'd start out with the 'Best Of' episodes from the past few years. That'll give you a good sample of what the CBB is about at its best.
Earwolf,3co4ly,mi-16evil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:12:34 2015 UTC,"For good episodes I would suggest looking at guest lineups and keep an eye out for familiar names and use that as a jumping off point. I would recommend any episodes featuring any of these guests James Adomian, Lauren Lapkus, Paul F Tompkins, Andy Daly and Jessica St.Clair. For me they are each in the 95% always funny great episodes."
Earwolf,3co4ly,BertSnerpis,8,Thu Jul 9 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"There is no live recording, it's all pre-taped. You can absolutely listen to previous episodes. That said the TV show is fairly different in format from the podcast, though many characters from the podcast are on the show. My recommendation is to watch the show on Netflix and then if you see an episode with a character you like, try to track down that character's podcast appearance. For example I loved the Cake Boss episode of the TV show and because of that I tracked down the Cake Boss podcast episodes which helped get me into the podcast."

That's what I fervently hope he meant at least."
Earwolf,3co0dd,sevillianrites,3,Thu Jul 9 19:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they said in a past episode that they'd record a handful of them to have them on reserve. I think that's definitely what's happening. Just a matter of when they'll start putting them out."

And even if you're just on a different team in the league you'd like the exposure the league is getting to people like me in the Midwest.

For example: I recently matched with a girl on Tinder who had something about the Pistol Shrimps in her bio. I thought this was awesome and that she would be a weird comedy freakazoid like me. I asked her if she listened to the podcast and she said she didn't but promised she would, then came back and told me it was ""weird"" and unmatched us.

Earwolf,3chwr4,bandola,19,Wed Jul 8 21:49:55 2015 UTC,"I wish I could do comedy for a living instead of having to work for a fucking corporation where people think getting free stale croutons from Panera Bread is exciting.   Hey, there is hope, but being that funny does take a considerable amount of effort and hard work. However, the upshot of that fact is that pretty much anybody can become funny. If you want to write, start writing sketches and scripts of tv shows. If you want to perform, start writing bits and taking improv classes. Go to an open mic. That kind of stuff will not only help with your end goal, it will help you have more fun in your everyday life.  It can seem like a long ways off, but it all begins with little (and mostly free!) things. Start working on small stuff and build some momentum. Find a way to make it fun for yourself, and you won't want to stop, and eventually you'll be good enough to do it as a job.  I'll share my story:  6 years ago, I graduated from a STEM undergrad degree and started a MSc program. Throughout my masters program, I wrote scripts for tv shows and sketches that I like, basically just copying the things I found funny. Eventually, I wrote some sketches that I started filming. I created a (mostly bad) sketch comedy show that aired on local cable access. By the time I was done my masters, I had a lot of practice under my belt. I went to film school (not necessary) for a screenwriting program, where I got some more training (very necessary), and when I graduated, I started working a low level job at a production company. A few connections later, I was working as a writer's assistant on a tv show, and am now a professional writer.  I tell you all that to say, there is a path you can take if you genuinely do want to do comedy and get out of your situation. It would require a lot of work and dedication, but there is a way there. I started in a math program and wound up writing jokes for children's tv. Your path may be much different, and/or take a bit longer, but you have options."

Earwolf,3chao0,toomanylizards,33,Tue Jul 7 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"My hunch is that it was Ice-T. My evidence: Ice-T has his own podcast, and I seem to remember PFT telling a story about Ice-T reaching out to him in order to prank him. I rest my case."
Earwolf,3chao0,cameronxylo,15,Tue Jul 7 22:46:51 2015 UTC,As Ice-T impersonator called PFT as Ice-T confronting him and PFT had no idea it wasn't the real Ice-T   This is the episode of Ice-T's show where they play the clip. Not sure when it happens but they also talk about Coco's REAL butt and advice for Justin Bieber which is obviously a great listen.
Earwolf,3chao0,GiantDeviantPiano,9,Wed Jul 8 00:50:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, even Ice-T is sponsored by SquareSpace and NatureBox."
Earwolf,3chao0,nyan_swanson,8,Wed Jul 8 01:00:18 2015 UTC,I wonder if he's also a fan of Jim Gaffigan.
Earwolf,3chao0,Prax150,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:50:05 2015 UTC,The Jim Gaffigan Show is life
Earwolf,3chao0,mark10579,3,Thu Jul 16 00:41:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! Do you remember where PFT told the story about that? I feel like it was probably during one of his Never Not Funny appearances.
Earwolf,3chao0,cameronxylo,3,Wed Jul 8 00:56:21 2015 UTC,"That sounds likely, but I looked it up on nevernotnotes.com and there's no mention of Ice-T in a PFT episode.  AHA, it was on Nerdist, but seems to be a text interview only.  I can't find any audio, but sure I've heard some  http://splitsider.com/2014/02/paul-f-tompkins-talks-about-being-prank-called-by-an-ice-t-impersonator/  http://nerdist.com/paul-f-tompkins-on-speakeasy-impressions-the-return-of-pod-f-tompkast-and-more/"

Earwolf,3chao0,GoTheShonk,3,Thu Jul 9 01:05:30 2015 UTC,clip is about 5:00 to 10:00
Earwolf,3chao0,potatohead3,14,Wed Jul 8 04:16:11 2015 UTC,I bet it was Huell Howser. But Scott said no because he's dead.
Earwolf,3chao0,mullacc,6,Wed Jul 8 03:38:11 2015 UTC,Spooky
Earwolf,3chao0,SquidWithBatWings,7,Wed Jul 8 05:06:25 2015 UTC,My guess would be Ice-T. We know he is aware of the impression and as a podcaster (and O.G. Pimp) he probably wouldn't feel intimidated being on the show.
Earwolf,3chao0,MondoBizarro,13,Tue Jul 7 22:52:19 2015 UTC,"My guess is Tom Leykis, because why else would Scott turn it down? Ice-T seems like the obvious choice but I can't imagine Scott not wanting that to happen. Leykis on the other hand is actually a despicable person so it'd make sense for Scott to tell him to fuck off"
Earwolf,3chao0,mark10579,5,Wed Jul 8 00:05:49 2015 UTC,Could also be the scummy former head of US Apparel. I don't think he has much to do these days.
Earwolf,3chao0,Dirtybrd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"Very good point, I hadn't considered that"
Earwolf,3chao0,mark10579,2,Thu Jul 16 00:45:23 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Scott would trust Ice-T  (or most of the celebs that get spoofed on the show) to completely ""get"" the joke and go along with it though. It would just be hard to reconcile having two Ice-Ts there. Maybe if PFT was doing another character.  But I imagine Ice would want to hear the impression at some point. So it would be weird and could derail the flow of the show.   But yeah, Tom Leykis is someone they'd probably give a hard pass to.   Werner Herzog would probably also be a weird fit for the show.   I was thinking about Amy Phillips' Sarah Silverman impression recently (weird how she never appeared on the show again). Although Scott probably wouldn't deal with Silverman's agent.  But thinking about it now, it seems like the sort of thing  Silverman might be into."
Earwolf,3chao0,spikey666,6,Wed Jul 8 02:41:23 2015 UTC,"Kind of off the rails here, but Sarah Silverman has been on CBB and other Earwolf podcasts many times over the years. Sure, not since 2013 but still... she's definitely a friend of the show."
Earwolf,3chao0,pdxsean,4,Wed Jul 8 03:37:48 2015 UTC,she's also close friends with kulap
Earwolf,3chao0,hipslike,6,Wed Jul 8 03:41:13 2015 UTC,"Hard to imagine not being close friends with Kulap, given the opportunity.  Sarah also dated Kyle Dunnigan for a while. I'm guessing he was too shredded for her taste."
Earwolf,3chao0,pdxsean,2,Wed Jul 8 03:47:44 2015 UTC,Intimidated by his tiny calves no doubt.
Earwolf,3chao0,ActuallyMike,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats what I meant. Silverman would probably just call Scott directly. But I could have seen her wanting to go on with someone impersonating her, but Scott nixing it as too awkward. Just some wild guessing."
Earwolf,3chao0,spikey666,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:34:23 2015 UTC,Ah. Well. Another misunderstanding gone awry on the internet. AKA why I should just leave things be and move on. :)

Earwolf,3chao0,Rimm,2,Thu Jul 9 00:35:34 2015 UTC,i wonder why he said no...
Earwolf,3chao0,jononyx,11,Tue Jul 7 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't want to walk the impersonator into a trap where the person they imitated uses the show as a soapbox to yell at them.  Also, Scott doesn't like to break the fourth wall on CBB. An episode predicated on the idea of an impersonator meeting one of their impersonations would pretty much just be that."
Earwolf,3chao0,Treeducks,2,Tue Jul 7 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"i think it had to do with the person who wanted to come on.  If the fourth wall thing was an issue, they could easily throw in another character/idea to even it out at the end.  e.g Ice T(the real one) and Ice T(PFT) would both appear on the show but it would slowly be revealed to be Mike the Janitor who got hit on the head again and thought he was Ice -T or J.W Stilwater has been working on his disguises into order to break into the criminal underground"
Earwolf,3chao0,jononyx,4,Wed Jul 8 04:47:51 2015 UTC,"My guess is because the person asking is a bad person, which leads me to Tom Leykis"
Earwolf,3chao0,mark10579,7,Wed Jul 8 00:06:26 2015 UTC,"In Bossypant's Tina Fey writes about how the SNL writers hated having to incorporate impersonated characters into their sketches in ""sneaker-uppers"". Could be a similar impulse."
Earwolf,3chao0,credibit,2,Wed Jul 8 00:19:20 2015 UTC,Maybe a politician? Maybe Scott didn't want the show to get actually political.

The Best Show is great, but you need to be patient sometimes. If you subscribe to the podcast, they release occasional 'Best Show Bests' which are snippets from the full shows (celeb interviews, bits with Wurster characters) and that may be a good spot to dive in. That said, I dove right into the full show and I covet it as much as any other podcast/radio show."

The Wurster calls are always brilliant, although it takes a while to get into the Newbridge universe, as it's so interconnected and well realized. The characters are all related somehow and there are story archs and such. The calls can be quite long so you have to be patient enough not to be turned off by lack of instant gratification.

Earwolf,3cc23i,DocSub,3,Mon Jul 6 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"Well he was funny on CBB TV as a guest, and he'll likely be doing a lot of Comedy bits/sketches just like reggie so I imagine Scott will use the opportunity to prove he can be funny and prime everyone up for the next era of CBB TV"
Earwolf,3cc23i,Slayner,7,Mon Jul 6 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"AND. I posed this question earlier in a different thread. Does Cudi make a new song for CBB? They won't have Reggie on the TV show, so I'm assuming they'll change that one. BUT WILL THEY CHANGE THE PODCAST ONE?"
Earwolf,3cc23i,RedFrogMario,27,Mon Jul 6 20:56:51 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that Reggie plays the theme song live for each episode of the podcast.

Earwolf,3cc2l6,Khanstant,2,Tue Jul 7 06:06:36 2015 UTC,"I've always been kind of a podcast completist. When I found a new show back in the day (4 years ago) I would listen to a podcast from the beginning and refuse to skip episodes to more recent stuff.  CBB was perfect for this. I've heard every episode and most of them I've heard twice. If I didn't have a show of my own to host, I'd listen to the whole thing again."
Earwolf,3cc2l6,Aquaman_Forever,2,Tue Jul 7 09:11:10 2015 UTC,"I started doing this over a year ago, and I'm almost caught up with the whole thing; it's really been great seeing how it's changed over time.  (I actually decided to do this as my entry into the podcast after enjoying the TV show, which was maybe a weird way to start with the podcast?  I'd never heard any of it before, just decided to start with episode 1.)"
Earwolf,3cc2l6,Galerant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"I think every episode is a bit of an overkill. However, a weekly series where someone posts everything from one person, or one character would be awesome. I'd have a Tom Leykis week any week, there are individual characters like Gary Marshall or the bachelor brothers where it would be fun to listen to in order."
Earwolf,3cc2l6,mm825,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:21:41 2015 UTC,Its fun to see how some of the characters voices are slightly different on the first time they appear
Earwolf,3cc2l6,jononyx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"I got into the show at around episode 250 maybe so I'm listening to the old stuff for the first time. I'm on 48, so glad I went back and heard Cyber Thug"
Earwolf,3cc2l6,SpcAgentDaleCooper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:54:18 2015 UTC,I can't believe they haven't done a Cyber Thug ep in that long.  He and Miles Archer are hilarious. The episode where Miles Archer rapped was hilarious in how actually good that the rap was.
Earwolf,3cc2l6,ivtecdoyou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:28:53 2015 UTC,"I went through and tried to write down the first instance of each running joke. I got through like 25 episodes before I gave up, and sadly have lost that list. But it was interesting to think there was a time when ""closing the floor for questions"" wasn't even a thing - let alone there being no warning - and it's fun to hear them say something the first time without knowing that a catchphrase was born."
Earwolf,3cc2l6,pdxsean,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:54:08 2015 UTC,"Ooo, good chance to hear some ""What Am I Thinking?"" and ""Dead or Alive""."

Earwolf,3cc2l6,supafish93,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:15:09 2015 UTC,I think in the beginning the show was also broadcast over LA radio... Maybe that's why he was keeping it clean?

My favorite notes to take are the 'Hayes Plays a Song' page.   My favorite discovery was that the French film crew referenced in the Mikal Cronin episode was legitimate and not actually a joke.   The Sinbad episode page looks beautiful, and I'm also proud of the B.J. Novak page."
Earwolf,3caxrv,Bibbity-boppity,3,Mon Jul 6 15:29:27 2015 UTC,"You know I checked yesterday and it says you've edited the wiki something like 2,000+ times and me like 500 and some change, that's insane.   Also, you're right about John Cochran that was great too."

Earwolf,3ca0kl,awesomeman462,41,Mon Jul 6 07:11:26 2015 UTC,"The part where finch refuses to yes and about his boss being a terrorist and Scott freaking out saying he's not interesting at all was one of the hardest times I've laughed in awhile.   That was so ridiculously funny, how they kept expecting Paul Britain to give him something and he just never did."
Earwolf,3ca0kl,Slayner,19,Mon Jul 6 12:32:19 2015 UTC,I was hoping that the bomb wouldn't explode at the end. I wanted an episode where legitimately nothing happened.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,Slayner,10,Mon Jul 6 20:41:16 2015 UTC,That would have been great. Still pretty funny though. Paul was giving them nothing to work with lol
Earwolf,3ca0kl,PM_ME_OK_BOOBS,9,Mon Jul 6 20:48:03 2015 UTC,He set up that isis thing so early and then held back so much. Truly enjoyable.

Earwolf,3ca0kl,DrBearPHD,19,Mon Jul 6 17:36:04 2015 UTC,I wonder if anyone has a brand new comedy series on TV Land
Earwolf,3ca0kl,donutman84,5,Mon Jul 6 08:24:24 2015 UTC,Brian Regan perhaps?
Earwolf,3ca0kl,gerradp,3,Tue Jul 7 02:47:03 2015 UTC,I was listening to this on a NYC subway car filled with Jim Gaffigan show ads.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,sevillianrites,16,Wed Jul 8 16:37:46 2015 UTC,Paul Brittain is very underrated as an improviser. I hope he does more Earwolf stuff in the future.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,sleepsholymountain,4,Mon Jul 6 07:27:00 2015 UTC,Strongly agreed. I have only listened to a chunk of his character this week (so far) and he's really witty. Just bee pollen
Earwolf,3ca0kl,Drew_Eckse,15,Mon Jul 6 16:10:17 2015 UTC,Super excited for this. Jimmy and Scott have a fantastic rapport.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,TheRealMKrall,14,Mon Jul 6 07:16:34 2015 UTC,Still not clear on how many people are on the squads.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,ItsScriabinAwhile,4,Mon Jul 6 15:56:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I listened back to it and I'm still lost. Too many numbers.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,StickerBrush,37,Mon Jul 6 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, Scott says he, Mantzoukas and PFT come up with Heynong Man. But I'm like, pretty sure it was him, Mantzoukas and Mike the Janitor was it not?"
Earwolf,3ca0kl,Slayner,21,Mon Jul 6 13:39:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought that was weird too. PFT is only on the best of episodes.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,mi-16evil,9,Mon Jul 6 15:03:07 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, Scott (and some of the guests) have been way more open about playing characters recently. Lauren Lapkus said it, and I think PFT did? Or maybe Scott said ""that's one of Paul's characters."" Something like that."
Earwolf,3ca0kl,Prax150,3,Mon Jul 6 18:01:12 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it goes back to the best ofs how Scott and PFT were talking more about the behind the scenes.   I think he wanted to peel back the curtain just a bit that way the casual listener can learn who these people are and appreciate their work more.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,Drew_Eckse,7,Mon Jul 6 18:17:35 2015 UTC,I hope for the best of 2015 episodes he and PFT address the actors behind the characters again. It made for a great set of episodes last time.

Earwolf,3ca0kl,Emleaux,3,Mon Jul 6 21:54:48 2015 UTC,Scott needed a heynong man reset.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,ajg1993,12,Mon Jul 6 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"Jimmy was killing it. He always talks about how he loves coming on the show and interacting with characters. I get a real charge out of him on the show! I wish he'd be at Horatio frequency of visits, he and Scott have such a wonderful rapport."

Earwolf,3ca0kl,Slayner,8,Mon Jul 6 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"I like him, too. However yesterday he came on my Pandora (did you know Pandora has comedy!? I didn't!) and I realized he does his whisper voice a lot and I think he relies on it a little too much, but his bits are always very funny."
Earwolf,3ca0kl,TakeItToTheMax,4,Mon Jul 6 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"I think he's toned down the whisper voice recently. His first special had a lot of it, but it was still fresh then. In a different special (I think Mr. Universe) he makes a meta joke about ""he's doing that voice again"" so I think he knows."
Earwolf,3ca0kl,SpottingDeer,5,Tue Jul 7 05:24:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't care for his whisper voice, it can be extremely annoying, but he's pretty witty and quick on his punchlines and that's what's important.   And yeah actually before started listening to podcasts I listened to a lot of stand up on Pandora!"
Earwolf,3ca0kl,credibit,4,Mon Jul 6 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"Nice! I guess I had it flipped, Podcasts, then Pandora stand up. Listen to that at work when I'm writing police briefs to balance out my life. I save my p-casts for home when I'm gaming. Anyway, good talk, bro! (read that in Adam Pally's ""Bro"" voice from the plug bag song)"
Earwolf,3ca0kl,8eat-mesa,3,Mon Jul 6 15:32:39 2015 UTC,I saw the first episode of his show a month or two ago and it was actually pretty good.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,credibit,8,Tue Jul 7 21:35:35 2015 UTC,It's rare to see Scott put such little energy into his ads. Marone got so much more passion.

Earwolf,3ca0kl,unholypencil,9,Mon Jul 6 17:04:36 2015 UTC,He probably used up all his passion on those fucking dads and grads.
Earwolf,3ca0kl,GeorgeTaylorG,2,Mon Jul 6 17:19:50 2015 UTC,I honestly can't stand it when he does the ads. I have to skip them every time .

Earwolf,3c98w2,TheDimasBow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:29:01 2015 UTC,That sounds great. I wish they'd do more video episodes. I liked them way more than the show.
Earwolf,3c98w2,Ciandotmov,3,Mon Jul 6 05:32:38 2015 UTC,"Harris was on Who Charted a few times!  He is the guest on the very best episode, the Bizaro Ep.  Him and Howard talking about gathering wool is amazing."
Earwolf,3c98w2,jogswithwolves,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:54:54 2015 UTC,I actually don't like Heidecker too much on the show. I love Tim and Eric but he seems like he's never really trying to be funny on CBB
Earwolf,3c98w2,sketchyTK,8,Mon Jul 6 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think he's trying and succeeding in my opinion. It just so happens that his humour consists of making things awkward and uncomfortable by being an unfriendly asshole. I personally find it hilarious because if you get his humour it's obvious he is not being serious; his contentious interview about Heidecker and Wood on CBB might be one of my favourite episodes. But I get why someone would disagree.  Would love to see him deal with Sean and Hayes."

Earwolf,3c6xuk,Fatmanredemption,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:10:27 2015 UTC,I can't really get through the Todd Glass show because it's always a bit too preachy for me.
Earwolf,3c6xuk,Drew_Eckse,2,Mon Jul 6 15:31:33 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Well, usually Todd finishes his rants within the first 45 minutes of the show, and afterward it gets rolling. I should say up top I don't think any of the James Adomian episodes are preachy in the slightest. James is too interested in doing bits to really let Todd go off on progressive tangents.  That's kind of how it's structured. Often times it's first half serious, second half silly."
Earwolf,3c6xuk,Fatmanredemption,2,Mon Jul 6 16:49:40 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I love the James Adomian and (sometimes) Paul F. Tompkins episodes, because they are both really good at  keeping the discussion light and moving on to the comedy portion of the podcast. Recently, though, I was listening to Jen Kirkman's latest appearance on the show, and it just stayed on Todd being on the ""right side of history"" for a little bit longer than I preferred. And that's in almost every episode where the guests aren't major goofballs like Adomian.   That being said, when I get past that, I tend to enjoy teh podcast. That first half of Todd kind of boasting and everyone in the room just agreeing with him without having a lot of counterpoints turned me off from it."
Earwolf,3c6xuk,Drew_Eckse,6,Mon Jul 6 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"This is appropriate. I'm currently listening to the CBB episode with Maria Bamford and Tom Leykis. He said one thing that made me pause the podcast and laugh for a solid minute.  He was on the first episode of any Earwolf podcast I listened to (Sklarbro Country #69). It took me way too long he wasn't the real Jesse Ventura.  Adomian is simply amazing. Ventura, Leykis, Sanders, pretty much any charac that he does kills me."

Earwolf,3c6xuk,Paul_Gorfengensen,3,Mon Jul 6 14:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'm late to this thread, but I feel like chatting a bit about one of the most transcendent comedy experiences I've ever had.   I'm a huge Adomian fan, although at first I thought he was grating and didn't quite 'get it.' I still followed him on twitter, and one night he was complaining on there that people would think his impressions weren't ironic.   Once I saw that, I had a real breakthrough re: his characters, and everything kind of snapped into place. I've spoken about it before, basically to anyone that would listen, but his over-the-top, loud disgusting characters tend to have a reason beyond it's fun to be insane and loud and perverted. Dov Charney, George Zimmer, Tom Leykis are all based off real people that James abhors and his impressions are actually brutal skewerings of these grade-a b-holes (although I don't quite know the real story behind George Zimmer). The Sheriff of Nottingham character is based on the villainization of homosexuals by pop-culture/the media.  I love Huell Howser and Leykis, but one of my favorites is Dov Charney in Canadian Apparel. It was so vicious! It was an instance of comedy making me feel better about being a man when such horrible abusive people share my gender. I'm obviously a big weenie, but it was truly a revealing moment of gender discussion for me, not to mention it was hilarious and entertaining show anyway. Plus it was Joe Wengert's Burt Wonderstone character, all at the same time."
Earwolf,3c6xuk,nohorseman,2,Mon Jul 6 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Saying that really explains the main distinction between the PFT characters and the Adomian ones, being that James often plays eccentric intrusive dickheads (Charney, Zizek, Leykis, Crowe, Sheriff, Ramsay, Hitchens, Bush, Buchanan) some he might secretly agree with on most things (Ventura, Sanders,) and the occasional ""delightful"" (for lack of a better word) eccentric (Howser, Schindler, Welles, Busey, Giamatti, Hoffman)  Whereas PFT's are mostly the delightful eccentric (Cake Boss, Lord Webber, Marshall, Thicke, Herzog, Ice-T, Reilly, Glover) where the impression is just a funny version of the real-life person, and not a scathing critique of them."

Earwolf,3c6xuk,Fatmanredemption,2,Mon Jul 6 03:17:36 2015 UTC,I was just laughing at his bit about grocery stores at 3:00 AM. at 02:19:40 here
Earwolf,3c6xuk,drinkywinky,2,Mon Jul 6 02:25:30 2015 UTC,I once went to a stand up show in NY where he was a surprise guest and I recognized his laugh behind me before he went up from listening to so much CBB.
Earwolf,3c6xuk,samantha-mulder,2,Mon Jul 6 04:39:28 2015 UTC,"I miss Huell so much, I had zero reference for who he was an impersonation of and thought he was an original character. He was an amazing character that I learned was an impersonation when the real Huell Howser passed away. James is in my top 5 favorite Earwolf regulars, his standup album Low hangin' fruit is excellent and I am always excited when I hear his voice whether it's his own or an insane characters."
Earwolf,3c6xuk,MadMan2012,2,Mon Jul 6 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"He is the smartest improviser on CBB. So many really intellectual references, like when he did Slavoj Zizek. I shit my butt during that episode. And I love that, whenever he's on, Jesse Ventura is still trapped in the plug bag, I always forget that until he's on the show."

Earwolf,3c6xuk,Bigsaskatuna,3,Wed Jul 8 20:05:30 2015 UTC,Comes a very close second to Sean Clements in the official PFT impersonation rankings
Earwolf,3c78za,bloodflart,8,Sun Jul 5 15:14:09 2015 UTC,This is a fan made video I believe. I like the concept and I love the song but man some of those actors look so bored.
Earwolf,3c78za,oshoney,4,Sun Jul 5 16:01:17 2015 UTC,I think it makes it funnier
Earwolf,3c78za,Khanstant,2,Sun Jul 5 16:16:15 2015 UTC,Didn't see this posted or talked about. Fun vid I can get the kids to enjoy
Earwolf,3c78za,spikey666,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with the ref, but reading the title this sound quip popped in my head, as it often does even without prompting:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nJrMV_yIZo  The first thing! I always hear it as ""summa say,"" anyone understand what I'm tolkien about?"
Earwolf,3c7lnx,apaulg,9,Sun Jul 5 17:20:18 2015 UTC,"Just click on the shows and look at the cast members. Like 85% of shows at UCB LA have at least one person you'd recognize from Earwolf. Really any show will be at least entertaining, but the more performers you know and love the more you'll enjoy the show probably.   Also it's not too hard to get into the standby-only ASSSSCAT. Even if the line looks really long. They can fit a lot of people in there."
Earwolf,3c7lnx,oshoney,9,Sun Jul 5 18:22:14 2015 UTC,"If you can get tickets to Shitty Jobs before it sells out, you have to see it. It has a rotating cast of Ben Schwartz, DC Pierson, Dominic Dierkes, Sean Clements, and a couple more. I only managed to see it once when I lived in LA but it was the funniest show I ever went to at UCB.    Last Day of School is really funny and easy to get tickets to. It has Neil Campbell, Paul Rust, and Stephanie Allayne, among others (although again, its a rotating cast so not all of them might be there).  Paul Scheer and Rob Huebel's Crash Test is also a really good time if you are fan of those guys. The format will change a bit, but there is usually a lot of great interaction with the audience.  As someone else mentioned, most shows will have someone you recognize from Earwolf, and you really can't go wrong picking one. I never went to a show at UCB and had anything less than a great time."
Earwolf,3c7lnx,Iron_de_Havilland,2,Sun Jul 5 22:31:04 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome, I'll definitely look into Last Day of School. Those are some of my faves.  Thanks for the info!"
Earwolf,3c7lnx,PinkPompadour,4,Sun Jul 5 23:32:31 2015 UTC,Make a night of it. I visited LA around new years. Saw three shows in one night. It was spectacular.
Earwolf,3c7lnx,GilliMarshall,3,Sun Jul 5 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"I really like this idea, especially since the shows are so cheap/free"
Earwolf,3c7lnx,Antonton,4,Sun Jul 5 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"Try Shitty Jobs! I hear AMAZING things (but have never been), plus it has Benny Schwaz"
Earwolf,3c7lnx,headless_bourgeoisie,3,Sun Jul 5 23:45:50 2015 UTC,"Sentimental Lady and Convoy are probably my two favorite teams. Alex Fernie is on both and he's my favorite improviser at UCB, and he and his teammates have been together forever and have really good chemistry together.  Bangarang, Shitty Jobs, Facebook, Search History, Your F'ed up Family, and of course ASSSSCAT are other great options. Lauren Lapkus is on Bangarang, she and Besser are probably the most prominent Earwolf figures that still perform regularly at UCB.  Like others have said, stand-by ASSSSCAT is totally doable. If you arrive at the theater by 5:00 (or even 5:30), you'll have good seats.  Harold Night is a riot too, but you probably won't recognize any Earwolf people, with the exception of a few Cardinal Redbird people that I know were on I4H a little while ago."
Earwolf,3c7lnx,katiebug88,3,Mon Jul 6 01:58:23 2015 UTC,Id go watch Bangarang!
Earwolf,3c7lnx,WeeBabySeamus,2,Sun Jul 5 18:50:06 2015 UTC,The Sunday assscat show is first-come-first-serve but it's totally worth it.
Earwolf,3c7lnx,katiebug88,2,Sun Jul 5 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"ASSSSCAT is great, but Harold night is also great improv with a much smaller crowd, any weekend improv team would be really great too. I live in NY so don't know the LA schedule/teams well, but to get their own weekend spot a team has to do pretty well"
Earwolf,3c7lnx,WeeBabySeamus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:31:16 2015 UTC,Any specific suggestions for UCB NYC?
Earwolf,3c7lnx,kiljo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"my favorite ucb ny show is called cool shit/weird shit. it's once a month or so at ucb east, usually some improvising involved but mostly not! it's the most amazing bizarre great show I've seen at UCB. For improv I like cage match best, but you can't really go wrong with any of their improv shows except the jams/BYOT (unless you wanna participate) and indie cage match- those teams haven't necessarily proven themselves to be great. Fucking Identical Twins is a GREAT sketch show!!"
Earwolf,3c7lnx,GiantDeviantPiano,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:56:44 2015 UTC,Holy crap I've been watching cage match videos on Improv NY all day. I didn't know it was a regular thing. Too hyped. Definitely going to look into it next time I'm on NYC
Earwolf,3c7gx9,GilliMarshall,8,Sun Jul 5 16:34:40 2015 UTC,You would think a meet up to go to UCB LA or NYC would be a top priority

Earwolf,3c7gx9,Antonton,7,Mon Jul 6 03:50:38 2015 UTC,I feel like we're all too spread out for there to be a good amount of people at a meetup. But maybe there are enough in the LA area to do one.
Earwolf,3c7gx9,oshoney,4,Sun Jul 5 18:24:02 2015 UTC,Boston area meetup!
Earwolf,3c7gx9,chris_comfort,3,Sun Jul 5 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd go to that one."
Earwolf,3c7gx9,laurz,3,Sun Jul 5 22:22:20 2015 UTC,There really should be one. There isn't enough of a comedy related community in the area
Earwolf,3c7gx9,chris_comfort,4,Sun Jul 5 23:43:01 2015 UTC,We can meet up near that college in Boston! Maybe mike the janitor will be there?
Earwolf,3c7gx9,credibit,4,Mon Jul 6 01:42:30 2015 UTC,The Hollywood Handbook Earwolf Forum does Google Hangouts. I've never participated so I can't vouch for their excellence.

Earwolf,3c5fzl,WeeBabySeamus,2,Sun Jul 5 13:20:23 2015 UTC,That harbour bit was just excellent. And they tied it all together at the end in a really unexpected way.
Earwolf,3c3qsv,chicknsandwich,40,Sat Jul 4 14:04:06 2015 UTC,Let's make sure we only ask questions that set him up to quote something instead of questions that could yield interesting or informative answers.
Earwolf,3c3qsv,ColonelOfSka,33,Sat Jul 4 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I'm as entrenched in the CBB, Earwolf ""mythos"" as anyone else, but I can't help but feel like whenever Scott, Paul, etc. are interviewed and are just deluged with ""What's up hotdog!?!?!? What's your fuck-style, bro!?"" etc., they must feel at least a little bummed that apparently no one is asking or interested in any real questions, they just want to ""play"" with them. It doesn't have to be Charlie Rose, and I'm sure those guys are happy that so many people are into their comedy, but the balance seems waaaaay out of whack.  It's been a while since I heard any satisfying interviews with those people, and maybe it's just me, but for me? I'd like to see some better questions and less catch phrases, okay Dad's and grads of all stars and stripes?   My wife."
Earwolf,3c3qsv,lswanson,11,Sat Jul 4 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"That's great to see.  I don't really care for Scott, but I do love Scott."

Earwolf,3c3qsv,Slayner,7,Sat Jul 4 16:16:45 2015 UTC,Are you going to ask when the next UTU2TM ep is coming out? Because that is a really good question
Earwolf,3c3qsv,DefConGay,7,Sat Jul 4 16:37:38 2015 UTC,Ha! nah I'm sure plenty of others will. I'm going to ask something that's been bothering me for awhile. I want to know if the earwolf guys are going to make an app for the forums so it's easier to access and use on mobile.
Earwolf,3c3qsv,Slayner,12,Sat Jul 4 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"I want to ask him a question about Harris' passing, but don't want him to have to answer one.  :(  Also, very curious about his fuck style."

Earwolf,3c3qsv,throwmeaway76,3,Sat Jul 4 20:37:30 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he's gonna guest star in anything, because there's a lot of Earwolf regulars that appear on shows like Silicon Valley, Life and Times of Tim, etc. but he doesn't act much, except for CBB. It'd be cool to see Hot Soccermom in stuff like that. Or Is he too busy or something, now that he's a big Hollywood producer in the biz (business)?  I probably won't be able to ask this question, but I'm genuinely interested to know if he can't or won't do any guest spots on shows like that, which I love."
Earwolf,3c3qsv,windsurfing,2,Sun Jul 5 00:43:07 2015 UTC,I think he said he's done some acting for the new Mr. Show. Likely he's usually just busy and/or found it hard to get acting jobs.

Earwolf,3c2bn5,gabe1108,16,Sat Jul 4 03:17:48 2015 UTC,You can tell they definitely did. The dude said he went to 14 and they were just about to bro out.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,WeeBabySeamus,13,Sat Jul 4 03:36:47 2015 UTC,he was so cocky about it too that was the funniest part heh
Earwolf,3c2bn5,potatohead3,10,Sat Jul 4 06:06:43 2015 UTC,"Haha, that conversation was exactly what would happen  on the podcast right before Scott would yell at him for being boring."

Earwolf,3c2bn5,sprontos,10,Sat Jul 4 03:42:37 2015 UTC,T-Shirts? College Girls? Is anyone popping anyones Stones? Is Old Sourpuss involved? I need answers.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,brianysus,9,Sat Jul 4 02:50:22 2015 UTC,Ohhhhhhh shit! You poppin my stones?  I'll take what he said to mean the next episode will definitely feature Bonobos as a guest. Hope it comes soon! Been dying for more UTU2TM
Earwolf,3c2bn5,Condawg,8,Sat Jul 4 03:03:55 2015 UTC,Bonobos as a guest?! You are definitely poppin my stones.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,bigontheinside,2,Sat Jul 4 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think the next episode is a live one. So maybe they get backstage, Analyse Phish style."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,irishstevenj,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:49:52 2015 UTC,It's probably Scott and Scott sort of MST3K-ing various show clips like Scott and Harris did.  Hopefully Scott was as invasive with Thedge as he was with Gordo.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,jononyx,8,Mon Jul 6 20:48:45 2015 UTC,That guy has been to 14 U2 concerts? Scott and Scott should have him come in for an episode or at least call in for a bit

Earwolf,3c2bn5,oshoney,8,Sat Jul 4 15:54:47 2015 UTC,"Ah! I can't wait for the new ep. Hopefully it comes out this Wednesday, which would make sense since his movie comes out this weekend."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,oshoney,4,Sat Jul 4 03:57:12 2015 UTC,Unless they already recorded it I'm not sure it will come out that soon. I know Scott Aukerman is on vacation in Europe at the moment.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,newprofile15,3,Sat Jul 4 04:01:27 2015 UTC,"They went to the show already, I figured they'd at least have something by now.   Plus the way he worded that answer made it seem like it was done and coming soon - ""on our next episode we answer that question"". That sounds like it's done and ready to go."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,Condawg,4,Sat Jul 4 04:10:09 2015 UTC,I agree but this interview was actually posted on June 22nd so if they had something done by then I feel like it would have come out by now.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,newprofile15,5,Sat Jul 4 04:17:42 2015 UTC,"Nah, remember how long the gap was between recording the phish concert live episode and it being released?  It was a period of several months.  It takes a while to pick out clips and edit the episode... And then once they do that, they record some studio time to go with the live time so it all makes sense."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,gladvillain,2,Sat Jul 4 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, probably not. They said on the show that they were going to record a bunch of shows to have them ready. I wouldn't doubt that they've got a handful ready to go (hopefully to start releasing soon)."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,Condawg,2,Sat Jul 4 07:01:39 2015 UTC,"Nah, remember how long the gap was between recording the phish concert live episode and it being released?  It was a period of several months.

Earwolf,3c2bn5,Toephurky,9,Sat Jul 4 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"Dang, does it really get half a million downloads? I wonder how many downloads CBB gets."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,Condawg,6,Sat Jul 4 06:52:07 2015 UTC,"I inquired with midroll for ad prices for both CBB and UTU2TM last year. This was 5/29/14, and at that time, they told me the download counts were 175,000 for CBB and 50,000 for UTU2TM. I'm willing to bet they've grown a decent amount since then, but likely not tenfold. Adam might just have thrown a number out there.  (Note: I assume these numbers aren't secretive since all you have to do to get them is ask, but they're not publicly available without taking that step, so if anybody involved would rather not have this information here, let me know and I'll gladly remove it.)"
Earwolf,3c2bn5,Toephurky,11,Sat Jul 4 07:04:16 2015 UTC,"The CBB soundcloud page used to have the number of plays each episode got. Don't see it there anymore, but I remember most CBB eps were anywhere from 150-300k+.  On the UTU2TM soundcloud if actually shows the plays for each episode.  Not sure how accurate that is, but still very high listener-ship."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,C0mmun1ty,8,Sat Jul 4 07:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the Midroll stats mean first week downloads/listens. The actual live numbers are definitely much higher than that, especially since Soundcloud just counts plays on Soundcloud."
Earwolf,3c2bn5,gladvillain,2,Sat Jul 4 07:41:10 2015 UTC,Ah ok. I'm not in the biz (business). Didn't know what midroll was.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,Condawg,3,Sat Jul 4 16:20:38 2015 UTC,Also there iTunes plays are probably much much higher.
Earwolf,3c2bn5,newprofile15,4,Sun Jul 5 10:21:11 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, Adam's comment seemed kind of offhand like he was just throwing out a random big number which anything with popularity would seem astronomical if they assumed it was be a hobby project no one would care about. Thanks for the info."

Earwolf,3byuw7,benteter,9,Fri Jul 3 10:10:09 2015 UTC,"Phil Hendrie, a radio comedy talk show host, pioneered the 'call himself' method of creating fake phone calls that sound real. He'd have a phone in one hand and the mic in the other. Whenever he was going to talk into the phone, he'd push the mic away and vice versa. He'd improv the voice of the caller then respond in the mic as himself, quickly switching back and forth. Anyway, the phone dialed into the sound board seems like the most simple and effective method. No need for post production filtering."
Earwolf,3byuw7,jetpackjason,10,Fri Jul 3 14:14:56 2015 UTC,"Video of Phil doing his thing with the phone, switching between several in studio characters and a voice on the phone. https://youtu.be/JbO8dbZjcgc"

Earwolf,3byuw7,No_name_Johnson,5,Fri Jul 3 20:52:20 2015 UTC,maybe they really do call in on their cell phone or something and just turn away from the mic and talk into the phone.  but most likely they just have a separate mic that the audio engeneer has set up to sound like that
Earwolf,3byuw7,ClutchBlackWater,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:23:23 2015 UTC,"Since it's a prerecorded podcast it would be pretty easy. Different audio recording software allows you to isolate the audio coming out of each mic. After the recording you would use an editing program to put a telephone filter over whatever piece of audio you want. When Lapkus/PFT starts doing the character calling in, they are probably just talking into the mic normally knowing that it will sound like a phone call when it's released"

Earwolf,3c02d8,changry_perdvert,9,Fri Jul 3 15:28:09 2015 UTC,"I love it. Stella has played a huge part in my love for comedy so anything involving those guys I will devour.   That being said, the podcast is SUPER dry. So much so that I cant really listen to it while focusing on other things. I have to set time aside to listen to it. That makes it so I dont really listen as often as I should. But still, I would recommend the podcast to everyone especially if you like HH or have a taste for dry humor."
Earwolf,3c02d8,Pluppets,8,Fri Jul 3 16:20:26 2015 UTC,You're right with the comparison to HH.  It's super duper dry and as a fan of the Michaels I'm a big fan.  Definitely hard to get into for new listeners.

Earwolf,3c02d8,CrouchJr,7,Fri Jul 3 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I laugh out loud with some really deep belly laughs, but that's not necessarily what the show is.  Its more serious but they aren't afraid to veer into comedy if thats where the conversation takes them.  I know every episode will go deep into whatever topic they are covering, but it's also a pleasant surprise when they do generate those deep belly laughs.  Does that make sense?"
Earwolf,3c02d8,CrouchJr,7,Fri Jul 3 20:10:20 2015 UTC,"To me some podcasts feel sort of like a light broth, in that they don't get very deep into any particular topic.  But this show reminds me of something much richer, with a sort of thickness to it.  Something like a thick stew or a chowder that I would love to just dip my beak into, and unpack a little more."
Earwolf,3c02d8,Home-Baked,2,Fri Jul 3 22:27:38 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say that and especially using a clever food metaphor, because when I unpack these episodes in my head, it's almost like some sort of banana being peeled, where the yellow and inedible 'wrapping' as it were (dry chuckle) is the plain ol BS you have to metaphorically and physically remove to get to the meaty flesh of the fruit, or the discussion, if the metaphor was lost on some of the less literate listeners."

Or more likely you're talking about his canonical final episode, which was so long ago I can't really remember it. I'll assume that you mean the final episode he hosted, as opposed to the episode where he called in and sang ""I am not food.""

Earwolf,3bucmk,SteweyCore,10,Thu Jul 2 05:41:44 2015 UTC,"Howard is usually the one who is talking the most/a focal point of conversation. I wouldn't say he always dominates it. Some guests are prone to jump in more fully than others. And sometimes Howard's in a more reserved mood than others. I don't think so, they just have a playful friendship where he'll occasionally make flirty jokes to her. I believe I remember when a new music chart theme was introduced, Patton Oswalt was the guest and Howard thought the song was weak in the moment and hated hearing the theme in front of Patton, so he shut it down. And then Patton made a comment/joke about the song, because Howard himself was criticizing it. But generally I don't think so.  At this point in the show I believe they have interns that pick out the charts. Not sure though. They rarely go crazy obscure with the chart. Maybe it'll be like a top 5 in Italy or something. But yeah they switch it up as charts can get stagnant. I think the method to the madness is every 2 or 3 weeks go back to the standard Billboard top 40 chart or whatever version of that. ""The Ultimate Chart"". Of course two charted is a different process entirely."
Earwolf,3bucmk,advancedman,15,Thu Jul 2 10:53:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I feel like he's stepped it up a notch recently maybe but I think he's becoming such a prolific idea machine its justified I don't think so, her chest comes up a lot but that's all I can think of I feel like I remember someone about to but then realising it was one of Howards. Couldn't even guess at who. (His music is great though)  Yeah, totally at random. Now they generally pull simple charts that they don't need to put any work into.  It's just a jumping off point, but they used to have more range of charts"
Earwolf,3bucmk,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Thu Jul 2 07:49:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It gets pretty annoying when he constantly interrupts KuKu on Twooch. It's basically just Howard chart, and then Howards plugs chart and Kulap may mention where she ate lunch.    On the music, I think a few guests have been about to make fun of it, but then just ask ""Was that you?"" because they are familiar with Howard and then hold their tongue. Knowing it's comedy and that he gave probably 30 seconds of thought into it and an hour of studio time, I give it a big benefit of the doubt."
Earwolf,3bucmk,ivtecdoyou,5,Thu Jul 2 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"I have to say though, Ku is a real pro. She knows that Howard is the star and she is the 'straight guy'. She does a great job of facilitating his nonsense. Love their work"
Earwolf,3bucmk,poprocksandfolk,5,Fri Jul 3 00:52:30 2015 UTC,"For real. I love Howard Kremer, the dude's one of a kind. But he seriously needs to chill during Ku's chart on Twooch. He should just follow her lead and at least let her say her part first then jump into his own opinion.   I still enjoy the podcast, but I've literally felt bad for Kulap these past few Two Charted eps because it feels like she can barely get a word in."
Earwolf,3bucmk,GeorgeTaylorG,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:14:39 2015 UTC,Even when the Ku chart is just her parroting back the Stereogum top 5 tracks for the past 6 months? It feels so phoned in.

Earwolf,3bucmk,GeorgeTaylorG,12,Fri Jul 3 17:29:38 2015 UTC,Recently Howard seems to be in rare form and I am loving it. Howard jokes around about kookoo's lops but I don't think he would ever over step the friend boundary and does not seem to want to. Not to my recollection. His tunes are widely loved and praised as hits and classics. Howard usually picks rap music he's currently listening to and Kulap usually picks a chart like sternum or billboard.
Earwolf,3bucmk,GeorgeTaylorG,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:42:57 2015 UTC,Shoutout to the Sternum Chart!
Earwolf,3bucmk,reverendnathan,5,Fri Jul 3 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"Question 4: I think they work with what's best, and that has changed over time. They used to really focus on the guest for charts. For example, episode one with Chris Hardwick the ""guest"" chart is the top 5 best-selling video games for the month. This is the only time a guest-specific chart has been the third chart. I get it; the guests are too diverse to find very specific entries, and it just happened to work out in the premiere ep.  It's too easy to choose the top in cinema for the week, and I feel like that's been going on for a long time. They used to choose things like top in a genre if the guest was say a horror buff or something, but I think talkin' 'bout what's hip now in cinema works and holds as a current discussion point and is the most important chart to being in the now. I'm glad it's the mainstay.  The only really revolving chart, now that the third chart is twitter questions instead of games (which I get too; don't pressure the guest with this outfield idea for quizzing them on their own life, even if it's all good fun) is music. The top 40 is pretty stagnant, and veteran listeners can relate by how often we've had to listen through a 'Call Me Maybe' or 'Wrecking Ball' in the past. So now the music chart is much more varied and I like that because movies can slide off the top 5 pretty quickly but some real junk music has come to represent the top 10 of the top 40. So mix it up!"
Earwolf,3bucmk,Prax150,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:43:24 2015 UTC,"I say this every time the discussion comes up on WHOCH threads, but they really have to revamp the chart picking. Not only is it sort of monotonous that they basically do the same charts most weeks but it's been getting on my nerves that they do a movie chart every week and neither of them really knows anything about movies despite the fact that one of them is actually making one. Howard even has active distaste for movies in general.  The music charts aren't that bad but it's basically the same shit every week. Like unless they do something weird like a Japanese chart I'm almost guaranteed to hear them complain about ""Shut Up And Dance"" every week.   I would love if they tailored one of the charts to the guest every week and then the other be either movies or music depending on what was chosen. It shouldn't be that hard either, just ask the guest what they like or what they want to do. If someone says video games, then do video games. If someone says TV, then do like the highest rated shows of the week.  Some variety would be nice is all."
Earwolf,3bucmk,ivtecdoyou,2,Thu Jul 2 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"Nice point about the movie chart.  It gets old hearing the same thing about every movie, ""This is a crazy make-em-up and I won't be seeing this"" and then quoting the RT score. Kulap just always says ""I haven't seen it"" if it's not a superhero movie and then every superhero movie she just seems to shit on.   I've only heard them say positive things about period pieces/dramas/documentaries.   On letting the guest choose the chart, that would just exacerbate the problem because neither of them play video games or watch TV.  I love the show, don't get me wrong, but when the hosts consume almost ZERO of the media that they're talking about it just gets stale. Now I find myself listening to Two Charted more, because at least they know what the hell they're talking about."
Earwolf,3bucmk,IWantToMakeASuperman,11,Thu Jul 2 15:31:56 2015 UTC,"Q1. Yeah, it's always really be Howard's show. I don't mean that in terms of quality, amount of effort put in, or who deserves the credit… but it's kind of in his voice, with Kulap as the self-titled translator. [With ‘Stard now as the niche translator for when even Kulap’s lost.]  This may be a weird way of putting it, but using boxing as the metaphor: Howard is the two boxers, Kulap’s the referee and the rulebook. Howard’s putting on the show, but without Kulap it’d just be two crazy people fighting in an alley somewhere.  [I forgot to include the guests in that…]  I always think it’s noticeable with guest hosts too. When it’s Howard and a guest host [Emily or Natasha being the first to come to mind] it still feels like Who Charted… When it’s Kulap and a guest host [it’s still amazing but] it doesn’t feel as Who-Charted-y.  Re-reading this, I’m now worried I’ve not really addressed the specific question. Yes, he’s always been front and centre of the show! Even if it'd been Who Charted to get Obama as a guest... the show would have been 90mins of Obama reacting to Howard.  And I love that.  Q2. If anything, I'd suggest Kulap may be the more interested party. She's often mentioned how she's spoken to girls who've been with Howard, there's been a few 'donkey d*ck' jokes over the years, and yeah, she just seems fascinated by him, in every sense.  Q3. I can’t think of specifics off the top of my head, but feels like we’ve come close a few times. There’s definitely been times when, if the guest is quite opinionated or is into the mindframe of tearing stuff apart thanks to the previous chart, you can feel it, and Kulap will go out of her way to intro the next chart theme as being Howard’s. As if to give the guest a heads up before they even hear it. Get me?  Q4. It seems pretty random for the most part.  [Edit: formatting.]"
Earwolf,3bucmk,WoodElephant,9,Thu Jul 2 11:13:27 2015 UTC,sounds like OP just does not enjoy Howard Kremer
Earwolf,3bucmk,sourmilksmell,3,Thu Jul 2 19:57:06 2015 UTC,"Howard's input seems to ebb & flow. He's been really energetic lately, which makes for a good ep. There are other times where it sounds like he hasn't slept, and the show drags.  Off topic, it seems this past year the eps have been getting shorter. Not sure if they tightly schedule the studios, but there are guests that you would really like to have more fun and the show ends. Abruptly."
Earwolf,3bucmk,funkyb89,4,Thu Jul 2 12:32:41 2015 UTC,"At first he just annoyed me, but after a few months I started to really enjoy his special brand of madness."
Earwolf,3bucmk,shaky_but_nice,2,Thu Jul 2 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"Not always, lately he has a lot of stuff going on that he's anxious about, so it seems like he's doing that more. Kulap usually goes along with it or challenges him to add more to his goofy ideas, I think mostly because it makes her laugh when he says dumb shit. Nah, I think he has a lingering love for Australia. They joke about stuff like that, but so does Scott and it seems all in good fun. If you want to hear someone make fun of Howard, listen to Jessica St. Clair's first episode (maybe her only, I forget). I think she acknowledges Howard's lunacy moreso than any other guest, and it's hilarious. There's a Keeper of the Charts, it used to be Kulap but now I think there's another guy in charge of that."
Earwolf,3bucmk,born-under-punches,0,Fri Jul 3 19:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, he does, and it's really for the best. Kulap is a very pleasant person but not very interesting or funny."
Earwolf,3bucmk,86themayo,5,Thu Jul 2 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's always been Howard's show. And I think Kulap knows that, because when Howard's not there, she brings in a co-host that can dominate the conversation with his own kind of craziness (Armen)."

Earwolf,3bslec,nohorseman,14,Wed Jul 1 21:06:55 2015 UTC,Just listened and I found Patton to be incredibly unpleasant. He seemed to completely disregard the Hollywood Handbook guys and kept interrupting. I don't remember him being such a dick on old CBB eps but man was he unpleasant here.

Earwolf,3bt0et,GilliMarshall,9,Thu Jul 2 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"All I know is a story that louie himself told on opie & anthony a while ago. (I just looked for about 20 mins after posting for a youtube vid, no dice)   He started off by calling improv a ""boring art"" and then told about the one time he was doing an improv show with other people where he did nothing but put a stop to peoples bits and shut down every attempt to find a game. And he said something like, ""They were really upset, but I didnt care because I was getting huge laughs"" basically being really dismissive of the whole process while not even putting in the effort to try it. And he told the whole story in a kinda ""check out how cool I am"" tone that really made him sound like an ass.  Anyway. Im probably just showing my bias but that was one thing on a whole list that has made me dislike ck as of late."
Earwolf,3bt0et,Pluppets,12,Thu Jul 2 15:55:32 2015 UTC,"Ugh, every time I read anything about Louis I end up liking him less and less"
Earwolf,3bt0et,bigontheinside,4,Thu Jul 2 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"That's a straight up dick move. He seems to be good friends with a lot of improvisers, too, and I'm wondering if that's changed his view at all. Though, if it has it probably just means he's a dick in other areas of his life."
Earwolf,3bt0et,GilliMarshall,3,Fri Jul 3 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"This is could be either 'dream guest' or 'wouldn't fit in', but I am fascinated to see what would happen during a Bill Burr episode of Improv4Humans/Comedy Bang Bang"
Earwolf,3bt0et,shinja59,3,Thu Jul 2 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"I think the reason I don't mind Zouks is because that's almost the game they're improvising. Through his no, buts Andy Daly is able to spin gold that he wouldn't otherwise be able. Scott is the same way with Horatio."
Earwolf,3bt0et,Teenageboy69,2,Fri Jul 3 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question for me because there are guests you'd think wouldn't have fit well like Jon Hamm which have and vice versa. Plus it seems debatable at that. Plenty don't think Tig is good on CBB but she's one of my favorites to hear interacting with characters.  I've said it before but I'm a huge Norm MacDonald fan and would love an appearance from him as side kick on CBB but I'm fan enough to know that he would not fit well. I guarantee he'd interrupt bits for a story, maybe a good one but that's not the point, plus he doesn't do silly.  Same with say Jerry Seinfeld to a lesser extent.  A lot of traditional stand-ups don't seem like they can make themselves look silly for a scene unless it's written in a show or movie, imo."
Earwolf,3bt0et,TvsPhil,3,Fri Jul 3 02:21:45 2015 UTC,Since spontaneanation and I4H are very improv heavy there are numerous hilarious dare I even say fan favorites that wouldn't do well on.
Earwolf,3bt0et,Slayner,3,Wed Jul 1 23:11:30 2015 UTC,In general I have to say stand-up comedians don't do so well on CBB. Something about how they steer into more WTF type storytelling or jump on the game and take it over.
Earwolf,3bt0et,WeeBabySeamus,11,Wed Jul 1 22:52:58 2015 UTC,"Paul F. Tompkins was mostly just doing stand-up when he first started coming on CBB. Patton's great on there too. There's also Tig, Rory Scovel, Chelsea Peretti, Pardo, Eddie Pepitone, Jonah Ray, Kumail Nanjiani, Todd Glass, etc. Some of them are doing more projects now, but they've all been strictly just stand-ups for a large portion of their careers. And they are great CBB guests, IMO."
Earwolf,3bt0et,TheBlackSpank,4,Thu Jul 2 10:44:43 2015 UTC,"I think he maybe means more old-school style standups. I think we can all agree that Jay Mohr may have been one of the worst CBB guests ever. That's the type of guy he's getting at. I think all the people you listed, while mainly standups, do have backgrounds in improv."
Earwolf,3bt0et,Ed_Sullivision,7,Thu Jul 2 14:33:14 2015 UTC,"There are shitty guests, sure, but most of them are people that specifically reached out to Scott on Twitter, and Scott was just too nice to say no. Dane Cook, Tom Green, Jay Mohr, David Allan Grier. Being stand-ups isn't what makes them bad guests. Not getting the show is what makes them bad guests.  Jay Mohr is a particularly bad example as an old-school stand-up comic. He was a stand-up first, but he's still an SNL guy, so whether or not he can do decent characters, he should at least know how to play along with other characters like when Besser was on the show. Hell, he's got more movies under his belt than stand-up specials, and was briefly a sitcom star. And he's a shitty stand-up comic, to boot. He's just not funny and he has too big an ego to let anyone else take control. He was interrupting Besser every other second while he was trying to establish his character."

Earwolf,3bt0et,Teenageboy69,5,Thu Jul 2 15:02:34 2015 UTC,"Pepitone has come on and done nothing but characters for every appearance, so I don't know what you're getting at there. He yes and-ed everything that Scott threw at him. Tig, Chelsea, and Jonah were just fun. Tig is purposely antagonistic about everything and I enjoy it. Chelsea and Jonah tend to just take a back seat and enjoy the show while still throwing in jokes but not detracting from what's going on. Sometimes it's just fun to have another comedian sitting in and enjoying themselves. I happen to love it when PFT or James Adomian haven't even been introduced yet, and they're just laughing in the background. Different strokes for different folks."
Earwolf,3bt0et,TheBlackSpank,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:22:27 2015 UTC,"Idk about Jonah Ray, but the other four absolutely did. Like the other post said, Tig is super antagonistic and goes against 'yes and' pretty often. She can pull it off though. Chelsea I don't really get where your coming from, maybe it has to do with her Farts and Pro appearances which are pretty different improv. Pepitone definitely does yes and, and he's downright good at it. Listen to his charac of the morbidly obese diner cop."
Earwolf,3bt0et,No_name_Johnson,3,Thu Jul 2 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"My whole logic regarding this is based on how I would feel of i were improving with them. Tigs shtick might be funny out of the context of CBB, but within the actual scene its a detriment and I'd hate performing with her. Chelsea in farts was funny, but also was disinterested a lot and at one point literally told Harris he got an improv do over. That got a laugh out of me, but if I were in a scene with her I'd be afraid she'd railroad the premise. I honestly didn't listen to the second Pepitone CBB after he essentially played himself the first time I heard him.  I love all three of those dudes as comedians, I just don't see them as being particularly suited the show, aside from being friends with the host."
Earwolf,3bt0et,Teenageboy69,2,Thu Jul 2 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"The Pepitone ep with Patton Oswalt is really really good FWIW. As for Chelsea I can totally get that, but I think she does that because she knows the other improvisers can A) handle it and B) make something funny out of it. Jason Mantzoukas is another good example of this, he really calls out Scott which for a new improviser would be an issue. However Scott can make something out of it. Mantzoukas also does something similar with Andy Daly where he relentlessly pushes Daly. Andy Daly is a brilliant improviser so not only can he handle it, he can make something out of it."
Earwolf,3bt0et,No_name_Johnson,12,Fri Jul 3 01:26:25 2015 UTC,Everyone points to Mike birbiglia saying he seemed awkward and didn't understand the show but on both his appearances I thought he did good.

Earwolf,3bq2om,wolf_thing,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:34:24 2015 UTC,I think it is that university convocations / high school graduations are generally in June. I've never heard any connection to open houses.
Earwolf,3bq2om,credibit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:33:50 2015 UTC,Open house is a idiomatic term for graduation parties (where I am from).  Not to be confused with realtor open houses.
Earwolf,3brf5g,RedFrogMario,11,Wed Jul 1 15:25:27 2015 UTC,Really enjoyed season one. I can't recommend this enough.
Earwolf,3brf5g,Pluppets,4,Wed Jul 1 16:37:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a little weary of how they're going to handle this. I know Forrest is a bit dumb/naive, but he was pretty self-aware of what a D-Bag his producer was at the end of the season. I can't see him going back to the show unless obligated by a contract."
Earwolf,3brf5g,GilliMarshall,3,Wed Jul 1 18:14:37 2015 UTC,I believe I read in an interview that Forrest gets the ability to veto a certain amount of reviews. i'm not sure what other changes but I'm sure they'll make some more.
Earwolf,3brf5g,Pluppets,4,Wed Jul 1 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing, if that's the case, that vetoing a review is going to seem like the obvious choice at first but then end up back firing later."

It's easy to think that just because Scott (and a lot of other comedians) makes goofy jokes for a living that he isn't an artistic soul, but reading the thought process behind his writing reminds you how seriously he takes his passions."

Earwolf,3bqbe0,sevillianrites,22,Wed Jul 1 07:54:47 2015 UTC,I love Kuku but Emily is a perfectly good replacement. She's lovely.
Earwolf,3bqbe0,JasmineForsythe,14,Wed Jul 1 15:15:18 2015 UTC,"Love them both. I don't think if a newcomer was listening to this episode for the first time, they could even tell that Emily wasn't the regular host if they didn't say so from the onset."
Earwolf,3bqbe0,Drocavelli,4,Wed Jul 1 16:07:10 2015 UTC,She missed a couple of beats but that would be expected if she didn't know Howard's flow. I like her a lot on The Indoor Kids but it was nice to see a bit of a change of pace from that. Grep.
Earwolf,3bqbe0,Prax150,4,Thu Jul 2 14:07:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly when I see Emily's name on an episode, even though I know it means no Ku... I ain't even mad."

Earwolf,3bqbe0,GeorgeTaylorG,10,Thu Jul 2 04:24:59 2015 UTC,Howard should workshop with Adomian and Emily more -  transgenerational is a much better term
Earwolf,3bqbe0,nohorseman,9,Wed Jul 1 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"This episode was a breath of fresh air. For the last month or so, Howie's been in a Self-Promote/Have A Summah/Gu Cruise/Ocean Beats Space loop (rinse and repeat, ad nauseum). Having someone other than Ku in the studio with him forced him out of it.   Plus Adomian is the best, I love hearing the ""real"" him now and again!"
Earwolf,3bqbe0,kaylynnej,9,Wed Jul 1 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"Of all Earwolf people, James Adomian is the guy I would most want to just hang out with on a daily basis. His characs are amazing but hearing him in a traditional talk show format like Twoch or Todd Glass show how fucking naturally hilarious he is. And, he just seems like a really smart, good dude."
Earwolf,3bqbe0,apaulg,7,Wed Jul 1 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"Huh. I did not know that James Adomian is gay. I guess I only know him through his characters, I know almost nothing about him as a person."
Earwolf,3bqbe0,sleepsholymountain,17,Wed Jul 1 17:12:07 2015 UTC,He's pretty open about it. There's an episode of CBB from last year where he and Todd Glass actually have a serious discussion about it.
Earwolf,3bqbe0,weaglebeagle,8,Wed Jul 1 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"My listening habits last year were a little spotty so I ended up missing a ton of CBBs. That must've been one of them. Todd Glass is also gay, right? Sounds like an interesting ep."
Earwolf,3bqbe0,sleepsholymountain,5,Wed Jul 1 18:02:27 2015 UTC,"It was a lot about Todd and his book. It was still funny, but I remember some people being upset. I loved it, just because I think Todd is interesting and love Todd and Adomian."
Earwolf,3bqbe0,8eat-mesa,4,Wed Jul 1 18:22:52 2015 UTC,Tod came out on an episode of WTF which is also really interesting listening if you can find it (I think Maron charges for old episodes)
Earwolf,3bqbe0,GiantDeviantPiano,5,Fri Jul 3 09:54:31 2015 UTC,One of my favorite episodes!

Earwolf,3bp7wx,novation123,9,Wed Jul 1 01:16:03 2015 UTC,"The only impression done better by an Earwolf regular is James Adomian's Tom Leykis. THAT is spot on, but damn the L Ron Hubbard is so good. Daly perfectly captures his batshit ideas and true sense of grandiosity   Hubbard talks about Xenu origin story"
Earwolf,3bp7wx,changry_perdvert,9,Wed Jul 1 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"I think most of Adomian's impressions are at that level.  Look up any of his characters in real life, Bernie Sanders, Paul Giamatti, Huell Howser, even Slavoj Zizek and they are spot on.  Adomian fucking rules."
Earwolf,3bp7wx,coolnamehavingguy,3,Wed Jul 1 04:17:34 2015 UTC,"Huell Howser is one of the all time greats. And his last appearance on CBB was oddly sweet and beautiful. Adomian genuinely liked Howser and didn't want to do the impression anymore after he died. Huell was certainly a strange guy, but he was definitely an excitable, nice person too."
Earwolf,3bp7wx,CrouchJr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"Adomian slipped into Anthony Jeselnik on the lady Who Charted and it blew me away, it was so easy for him and it came out perfect.  It's a good episode if you want to hear him go through almost every impression he does, even though the episode does miss Kulap's energy."
Earwolf,3bp7wx,Paul_Gorfengensen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:07:56 2015 UTC,"I love Adomian because he's so quick.  Like, he never stalls when Scott asks him a question.  He just comes out with this ridiculous stuff instantly."
Earwolf,3bp7wx,PopWhatMagnitude,5,Thu Jul 2 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"Where I live we had a great FM talk station about 10 years ago and Leykis was syndicated on that station, so I would hear him far more often than I would have liked.  Adomian may have mastered the most spot on impression of all time. It is truly awe inspiring.   One time I heard Paul F. Tompkins do an impression of J.W. Stillwater, not bad."
Earwolf,3bp7wx,shitapillars,3,Wed Jul 1 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"Wait a second... Leykis is a REAL PERSON?!   Also if you haven't heard Lauren Lapkus' podcast with Adomian hosting as Leykis, definitely listen.    EDIT: Holy shit, blowmeuptom.com is his actual website. Dear lord this is mindblowing."

I will have to check out the show, I have been working my way through most of the podcast archive and was curious anyway.  I remember him from Mr Show, just haven't seen him leading the way on any sketches. This is fucking hilarious."
Earwolf,3bi4ov,Slayner,7,Mon Jun 29 14:59:54 2015 UTC,"The shows a lot different then the podcast, but the writing is sincerely top notch. So many small jokes and puns sprinkled throughout. It's the kind of show that's great to re-watch because you miss a lot.   And the even better thing is IMO the show gets better each season."
Earwolf,3bi4ov,Scrondoth,2,Mon Jun 29 16:45:04 2015 UTC,It's a really funny show. It's great watching how he progressively is becoming more of a dick as the show goes on
Earwolf,3bhz6w,Slayner,12,Mon Jun 29 11:17:36 2015 UTC,"I fucking love Womp It Up. It took a little while to grow on me, as it is very different than CBB or Hollywood Handbook, but now I just think it is hilarious and pretty unique. So much good shit has come out of CBB and Earwolf, and they really seem to be the vanguard of comedy IMO.   Thousands of hours of free entertainment, it's a cool time to be alive."
Earwolf,3bhz6w,gerradp,9,Mon Jun 29 17:47:12 2015 UTC,I agree full heartedly. It's a pretty awesome thing to be able to never worry about running out because there's just SO much and they're constantly putting out more.   Womp it up has been fantastic too
Earwolf,3bhz6w,stenchwinslow,4,Mon Jun 29 17:49:48 2015 UTC,I really dig how they are slowly building out the world.
Earwolf,3bhz6w,stephenstories,4,Tue Jun 30 00:28:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. The only disappointment is the glaring lack of Gutterballs checking the levels. He's probably off scissoring Danielle Bartiromo

Earwolf,3bhz8y,TvsPhil,3,Mon Jun 29 15:46:55 2015 UTC,Is the scene any good? I am just now realizing that I don't think I like John Hodgman. I turned it off during the interview
Earwolf,3bhz8y,requisite_monocle,5,Mon Jun 29 16:24:17 2015 UTC,I'm going to leave that up to someone else to answer. I don't feel comfortable ever recommending anything to anyone. Especially comedy.  All I can say is I generally like all the scenes in this podcast but there's not necessarily anything memorable about this one.
Earwolf,3bhz8y,TvsPhil,2,Mon Jun 29 16:29:09 2015 UTC,I loved it! It went 4 or 5 scenes deep at times. Sooooo funny!

Earwolf,3bhmse,TvsPhil,16,Mon Jun 29 09:59:06 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this episode. We got Horatio's ridiculous character who witnessed the O.J. murders(I laughed hard at that reveal), Erin played a very out there character but relatively straight which is a good combination with Shelly Driftwood because it offers crazy and subdued, and finally I like Kumail and Jonah's non-character additions."

Earwolf,3bhmse,nyan_swanson,3,Tue Jul 7 10:45:49 2015 UTC,"I thought Jonah and especially Kumail were a lot more up for anything this time around since last year, they were a bit awkward and didn't seem like they were totally into it.   Horatio's still my favorite, so no surprises I love Shelly, and Erin's dragon had a lot of funny lines too."
Earwolf,3bhmse,8eat-mesa,3,Mon Jun 29 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"Which makes me glad, Kumail is one of my favorites. Huge Indoor Kids fan."

Earwolf,3bhmse,Slayner,18,Mon Jun 29 15:07:34 2015 UTC,I don't mind him as much as some others do but this episode he was super dry. Honestly I think he's better on who charted then CBB
Earwolf,3bhmse,catch_th3m_all,8,Mon Jun 29 16:32:50 2015 UTC,I'm not sure he was trying to be funny.

Earwolf,3bhmse,catch_th3m_all,5,Mon Jun 29 19:04:02 2015 UTC,On CBB or in general? Every time I've heard him on here he's played the straight man.

Earwolf,3bhmse,Doesntgetredditatall,9,Mon Jun 29 16:27:52 2015 UTC,The fake OTT laughing from Mira does it for me
Earwolf,3bhmse,Naterek,4,Mon Jun 29 16:35:49 2015 UTC,It was a combination of things. Jonah being there. Chris' attempt to make a shitty joke out of every other word the guest says. And Matt derailing everything and laughing way too hard a bad jokes. Those 3 just don't do it for me.
Earwolf,3bhmse,stephenstories,4,Mon Jun 29 19:07:32 2015 UTC,Dont forget Chris insisting to tie every point of conversation to his GD stand up.
Earwolf,3bhmse,8eat-mesa,5,Tue Jun 30 16:19:17 2015 UTC,He was one of the nerdists redeeming qualities for me.
Earwolf,3bhmse,IngmarBergmanAMA,2,Tue Jun 30 00:06:32 2015 UTC,He was on a Getting Doug with High live show once (I think it was the one with Harris) and I swear he said like <10 words
Earwolf,3bhmse,ectomimedbison,3,Tue Jun 30 01:48:53 2015 UTC,Doug said afterward that Jonah got waaaaay too stoned and was completely freaked out for the entire show.
Earwolf,3bhmse,IngmarBergmanAMA,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:55:59 2015 UTC,Makes sense. I would probably be that guy too.
Earwolf,3bhmse,TomLeykis101,7,Wed Jul 1 22:02:16 2015 UTC,"Erin Whitehead just doesn't do it for me. I don't find her naturally funny, while the best character performers can manage to make any half-baked character they create funny simply by their silly off handed comments and manner of speaking.   Sanz kills again with one of my favorite Earwolf characters"
Earwolf,3bhmse,adelduder,2,Mon Jun 29 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"I don't find her funny either sadly, her characters grate on me. Sucks because every Horatio ep is usually amazing."
Earwolf,3bhmse,stephenstories,2,Tue Jun 30 13:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you take out HS and the episode is a pretty big dud."
Earwolf,3bhmse,Slayner,4,Tue Jun 30 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty good episode overall, standard CBB. Not my favorite but not bad.   I did notice a couple things. Horatio was super quiet that second half, like really really quiet. The Dragon character could have been funnier if they dug into the whole religion thing a bit more.   Honestly the funniest part of the episode to me was just kumail and Scott bouncing off each other. Their chemistry was good.   Overall it was a fine episode but it had potential to be a lot better."
Earwolf,3bhmse,CrouchJr,4,Mon Jun 29 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"I kinda got bored 15 minutes into the dragon bit and stopped listening, so I'll have to finish it up later.  That seemed to stall a lot of Horatio's momentum."
Earwolf,3bhmse,Prax150,14,Mon Jun 29 12:13:44 2015 UTC,It really picks up when they get to Would You Rather.
Earwolf,3bhmse,CrouchJr,4,Mon Jun 29 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"It did, cardboard cutouts are hilarious.  Overall kind of a meh episode because it slowed down so much in the middle.  Oh well, it can't be magic every time."

I was fortunate enough to see a taping when I visited NYC last year, and it happened that Hannibal Buress was the guest that night, and they were hosting their own phone sex line that night. His main cast is made up of UCB regulars around NY, you can actually see a lot of his cast in shows like Broad City (along with Gethard himself).  I like to think of his show as pretty out there, absurdist stuff... ""In other words, it's right up my alley"", and I feel like many fans of the Earwolf podcasts could get on board with his show."
Earwolf,3bcak3,evuldave,9,Sat Jun 27 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"The group therapy thing is intentional.  The show picked up an early following among weird teenage comedy nerds and Gethard took that opportunity to frame the show as a big ""it gets better"" message to them.  While Gethard is serious about that aspect of the show, he also makes fun of it continuously.  They created a video game where the only gameplay element is that you type in something you are anxious about and Chris says its ok before hugging you.    I can see how that would come across as ultra PC, but I think that is misconstruing a similar message.  The Chris Gethard show isn't about not offending anyone (the show is regularly offensive), but Chris makes it a point to make members of the fan community feel welcome.  I think that is a more genuine and worthwhile endeavor."

I also chose not to report it for some complicated reasons. The owner then became shocked at the ER bill and wouldn't pay it (I'm insured but high deductible). I let it go. I really do regret it, the odds of these dogs attacking again are high. Owners are likely to say their pitbulls are protective/territorial, but that usually just means the dogs aren't properly trained and may attack others. They may - and often do - attack children. I used to think these type of dogs got a bad rap, but after researching, they are really sending tons of people to the hospital each year. Often the attack is the ""first"" attack, and too many owners use evidence that their dog hasn't bit anybody (yet) as it being safe and properly trained, but it's a poor way of looking at it.  Sorry - clearly I feel strongly about this, but I hope you feel better and get well soon. I'm not saying you need to go back and report the dog, but I would not go around it anymore.  EDIT: In case anybody cares - http://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-fatalities-2014.php. TLDR: Many dog bite fatalities in the US each year, mostly pitbulls, about half died are young children. Deaths represent only a small portion of all attacks."

I'm working on synchronizing the actual Entourage episodes (picture-in-picture style) to the marathon since the timecodes they started and stopped live weren't very accurate.   I'm not sure yet how I'll distribute it but I'll see about getting just the marathon up by itself somewhere since adding in the Entourage episodes themselves is more legally problematic.

Because we all just say ""well it's just a shit movie!""  I think she's also pretty bad at explaining what she means, especially at live shows, so she just lets it go and it becomes a big joke.

Paul kind of rushes them along but he doesn't seem overtly rude about it.   I think Zooks is fucking hilarious and he's probably in my top 5 favorite earwolf personalities. I get that he's playing up the dickishness for laughs. I thought it was funny at first but it's starting to wear thin because laughs at other people's expense is off-putting to me.  Love the show, love Mantzoukas and the rest, just wondering if anyone felt similarly."
Earwolf,3b8224,cameronxylo,2,Tue Jun 30 05:23:09 2015 UTC,"I know this is kind of a late reply, but I just got around to listening to this episode and specifically came on this thread to say that exact same thing. I don't know why you're being downvoted, but I agree with you. I love Jason too, but him making fun of that one audience member who was at the show alone and seemed to be nervous when giving his question was crossing some sort of line for me. I'm fine with that kind of humor between comedians (and friends) like when Jason is mean to Paul, but I know, as a huge fan of both the show and Jason, if I went to a live show and he made fun of me like that, I would've been absolutely devastated. Not because I can't take a joke but because pointing out that someone is alone and a ""nerd"" so that people laugh at them is just mean, especially when they're clearly nervous (and possibly not a native English speaker going on what that guy sounded like).  What's even scarier is how on-board the audience was. They cheered and howled when Jason pointed out that the ""nerd"" was there alone and then literally booed when he stumbled all over his question. I couldn't handle it. I think he made fun of one or two other audience members in this episode and, I'm going to use a June-ism here, it was upsetting.  EDIT: I don't know why this particular incident struck such an emotional chord with me. I guess it's because I generally assume Earwolf hosts identify and sympathize with ""nerds"" unlike other podcasters like Rogan and Carolla who associate more with ""jocks"" from what I know about them. Singling someone out, making fun of them for being a ""nerd,"" and letting the audience laugh at them is totally different than the way Jason usually just calls the audience as a collective ""nerds"" in a fun, light-hearted way. I love Jason, and he's a huge comic book geek himself, but since he's in a position of power where thousands of fans respect him and sometimes mimic him, his words carry way more weight than somebody else's would. I'm rambling, but basically, all I'm saying is that I'm sure Jason didn't mean to hurt the guy's feelings, but it's been happening more and more lately and not just with him or with HDTGM."
Earwolf,3b8224,temporarychair,2,Wed Jul 8 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I kind of figured even light criticism would get downvoted to hell, kind of annoying that no one who downvoted offered any kind of counter-point, but that's reddit for you.  I agree with everything you said. If I was in those audience members shoes I would have been crushed as well. It's just doesn't feel like light teasing at this point, it feels like the hosts sometimes have general animosity towards the audience members if they have ""bad"" questions. Whenever I hear Paul say. ""okay, this better be a good question"" my skin crawls just a little because it automatically puts the person in an awkward spot they'll have no hope of getting out of.  And you bring up a really great point that it's happening more and more and not just on this podcast. I honestly think that there are very few podcast hosts who actually listen to podcasts themselves. PFT is one of the only people I've heard mention that they are a regular podcast listener (another reason PFT is the fucking man). Some of the others seem to view average podcast listeners as nerds or losers and it can get insulting as someone who has supported these shows for years.     Now I'm rambling, my point is that it just feels beneath these remarkably funny people to resort to such petty stabs at humor at the expense of ONE OF THEIR FANS. I don't think any of them are genuinely mean-spirited people (or at least I hope not) and it's just part of the live show banter, and maybe the guy was laughing along with them, but in a strictly audio sense, they're too often coming off as impatient, rude assholes.   5 stars."
Earwolf,3b8224,cameronxylo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad to know someone else feels the same way! I haven't really seen anybody talk about it on this subreddit before, so sometimes I feel like I'm being overly sensitive or too ""PC"" whenever I notice it. The only reason I even think about it is because I care about the Earwolf community so much (shows, hosts, and other fans), so I hate seeing people being assholes or not being welcoming."
Earwolf,3b8224,temporarychair,2,Wed Jul 8 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think either of us see it as a deal-breaking problem but it's almost like seeing one of your close friends be a dick to a total stranger and it just feels weird and out of character. I'm a diehard Earwolf fan, but that doesn't mean that everything that is said or done is beyond any semblance of reproach."

Earwolf,3b8yw5,nehalvpatel,6,Fri Jun 26 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"You absolutely can, but take it from me in that I've heard every episode and have seen maybe 5 movies they've done. Ten at most.   The episodes are C+ (seriously so funny) if you watch the movie, but if you don't to be honest it's just okay.   If you have some free time/like movies a lot it's worthwhile without seeing the movies but if not I'd take a pass.   The strongest attribute of this podcast is the hosting dynamic between Paul Jason and June. It's very fun and lighthearted"
Earwolf,3b8yw5,Slayner,3,Fri Jun 26 23:15:11 2015 UTC,"depends on the episode, a lot of the live episodes really benefit from seeing the movie as the reference more visual things. But you can really enjoy any of them without watching. I'd recommend '88 minutes' it's maybe one of the best episodes"
Earwolf,3b8yw5,Nickelodeon92,2,Fri Jun 26 23:07:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've actually seen a movie they have done (thinking back over the past few months) and I enjoy it quite a lot.  I think it may add a little something to the experience, where you're just hearing these bizarre retellings of scenes you are clueless about."
Earwolf,3b8yw5,michaelstripe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"It does add a little bit. I've only ever watched one movie (No Holds Barred), granted it was after I listened to the episode about it. However, going back after I watched it added a new element to the show that is really hard to describe. They are just such amazing hosts though and picturing in your mind without seeing the films is another unique offering that the podcast offers. C++ eps for sure."
Earwolf,3b8yw5,rutteh,2,Sat Jun 27 20:40:44 2015 UTC,Start with some of the episodes discussing movies you've already seen. Then make up your own mind!
Earwolf,3b8yw5,Saermegil,2,Sat Jun 27 00:11:36 2015 UTC,I've seen a handful of the movies so I started there. But you really don't. Tho I'd recommend From Justin to Kelly. I think the HDTGM episode is longer than the actual movie and it makes it even more hilarious.
Earwolf,3b8yw5,HardAsIs,2,Sat Jun 27 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"It seems odd, but I think I actually enjoy the episodes more when I haven't seen the movie. For some reason it just seems crazier and funnier when I am coming in completely cold. When I've seen the movie I tend to just be agreeing with everything they say but not as outraged by it. Also I'm not as preoccupied with wondering if they'll bring up specific things that I had noticed.   But I know most people prefer it the other way, so I am probably just a little strange..."

It's a bit of a different experience if youve seen the movie, but it's equally hilarious if you haven't. They also mostly talk as if the listener hasnt seen the movie, so youll be fine."

Earwolf,3b4lm4,mullacc,3,Fri Jun 26 01:51:09 2015 UTC,"Yes he does. I mean, he obviously didn't mean to, but that collection of sounds comes out of his mouth.   I just don't hear the r-sound that Zouks hears when Scott says 'possibly.' He does kinda get stuck on the p-sound before spitting out the rest of the word though."

Earwolf,3b2uyh,angelfromthecoast,21,Thu Jun 25 14:57:52 2015 UTC,It has some decent moments. I'm probably biased but I think LL's character is the funniest. It's not great though. A lot of the jokes are extremely telegraphed and can be seen coming from a mile away plus being filmed in front of a live audience just feels antiquated for prerecorded TV shows.
Earwolf,3b2uyh,nicemaker,10,Thu Jun 25 16:33:04 2015 UTC,"They were on @Midnight. Lauren, Tisdale and poor mans Seth Green. And it was one of the worst eps ever.   Lauren deserves a line up with PFT and Scotty Auks."
Earwolf,3b2uyh,PopWhatMagnitude,10,Thu Jun 25 18:15:20 2015 UTC,I haven't watched it yet but I believe it's the case that when there's non-comedians on the show the writers prepare a lot of material for them to say (comedians like Lauren get to see all the clips ahead of time to prepare some stuff) so when they have a panel of non-comedians it's always so much more bland because no one is doing jokes in their specific voice. She was on with Besser and someone else a few months ago and it was great.
Earwolf,3b2uyh,nicemaker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"Lauren was very funny. The other two were not and there was clearly a lot of editing. They seemed pleasant, but not terribly funny."

Earwolf,3b2uyh,ericfishlegs,10,Sun Jun 28 17:59:25 2015 UTC,"It's average when it comes to sitcoms.  I love LL, but if the show doesn't pick up beyond what they're doing now then it won't last long. The 2nd episode with Tisdale singing was cringey, and as others have said I can see the jokes from a mile away.   TBS should check out some of the best comedy shows of the last 5 years: Louie, Comedy Bang Bang, Maron, Broad City, etc...   Then again, those aren't the ones making that Fuck You level money."
Earwolf,3b2uyh,ivtecdoyou,16,Thu Jun 25 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"I love Comedy Bang Bang, but I don't know if it's (and Maron) in the discussion of the best comedy shows of the last 5 years."
Earwolf,3b2uyh,Teenageboy69,3,Thu Jun 25 18:11:24 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how we're defining ""of the last 5 years."" If we're just talking about any comedy that has been active any time since 2011, I guess I agree with you. But if we're talking new shows that have debuted since 2011, I'd say CBBTV and Maron both deserve to be part of the discussion. I can think of only a handful of post-2010 TV comedy debuts that are as good as or better than either of those shows."

My bias could of course be shining through here, because of my love for both styles of comedy put out by Maron and Aukerman.   CBB isn't the first to take on a funny talk show, I think they're the first to take it out to the extent that they do. That is unless you count Tom Green, but I think we can all agree that was a different flavor.   I personally love Maron. I think it's a lighter version of Louie (which can sometimes get SUPER heavy), and the things he parodies are always on point. Self deprecation has always been my type of humor though."
Earwolf,3b2uyh,Teenageboy69,11,Thu Jun 25 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"I think CBB is kind of like a soft-core version of the Eric Andre show with a distinctly different sense of humor.

Earwolf,3b2uyh,Pluppets,4,Thu Jun 25 18:31:53 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about CBB TV or the podcast? Because I feel like the opposite for the TV show. Every episode coming out has to be ""the _____ episode"" or heavily themed in some way. Earlier episodes just had straight interviews with bits and silly games or sketches. not saying there has been a degradation of quality just something I've noticed.  If your talking about the podcast, you might just be comparing this year to the highlight real. There are plenty of episodes throughout CBB/CDRs history that are pretty standard interviews."

Earwolf,3b2uyh,gabe1108,3,Thu Jun 25 19:43:19 2015 UTC,I hate to say I didn't watch the live broadcast because I wanted to at least give my support for the premier but I think there was a Soccer game on. I eventually saw it and felt almost immediately the way I felt with Mulaney (although Mulaney was written better). The damn laugh tracks coupled with (like many others have said) predictable jokes and plot made it hard to sit through. Love Lauren of course and will support her regardless.

Earwolf,3b1ray,taco__night,8,Thu Jun 25 18:42:47 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand why Matt couldn't see what one of the debaters was saying. Saying the things that musician said was misogynistic vs them being a misogynist are two different things and neither is censorship. Also don't get the image/persona argument. Is it the idea that because it's all a bit, it's ok to be a asshole? Like I still can dislike things the Iron Shiek says/does and appreciate what they bring as a villain.   This reminded of this  show where Jim Norton and a journalist(I don't remember her name) were talking about rape jokes and he used the same old freedom of speech/it's a joke defense and she made a point that freedom of speech applies both ways and saying rape jokes because you're a comedian doesn't protect you from people saying that it's offensive and/or not funny to them. He went on some radio show the very next day and talked about how he didn't understand her point at all which I found crazy. I guess it's a weird defense mechanism where you refuse to see any other point because you don't want to be wrong maybe? Who knows. I found the whole case closed to be really uninteresting and I think I finally see what some folks talk about when it comes to Matt sometimes being annoying about certain topics.   Sorry for the long rant."

Besser already said everything that needed to be said, this sucks that I have to skip an Andy Daly ep because Besser wants to make a fool out of a couple ass hats."
Earwolf,3b1ray,ivtecdoyou,3,Thu Jun 25 12:44:51 2015 UTC,Just skip around the case closed segment. I just listened to the ep and its really good as long as you ignore that one part.

Earwolf,3b1gs3,nicemaker,3,Thu Jun 25 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"I don't want to show my naïveté here but, what exactly is a game in a scene? Is it just the justification of how the improvisors are heightening the scene or something else?"
Earwolf,3b1gs3,nicemaker,6,Thu Jun 25 12:02:12 2015 UTC,"No worries! I didn't know anything about game until I started taking improv classes.  Game has two meanings, but the ""default"" one is ""what makes this scene funny"". It can usually be summed up in a word. As you start a scene, you establish you the players are, where they are, and what is happening. Fairly quickly, something unusual will pop up. The players should address the first unusual thing and call it out, then there will be some form of justification for it. At that point you've kind of ""locked in"" the game. This is a gross simplification, but that's the general idea for long-form improv. Organic improv is more about finding the game, in premise improv (like I4H), the initiator will usually already have an idea of what the game will be based off something that came up in the opening (i.e., monologue, story, discussion, song, etc.).  Here's a great example from ASSSSCAT. This is based off something that came up in a monologue of a guy trying to be a better skier than he was. So the game is ""bad ski school"", and there's all kinds of ways to play with that. Once these characters have established who they are and what's going on, it becomes a ""if this is true, what else is true?"" scenario. Again, gross simplification, but that's the general idea.  In the context of a Harold, a group game between beats is more like an actual game that you play, and it's independent of any scenes that occurred. Usually ""the game of a scene"" will carry over in some capacity between beats, while the ""group game"" is a standalone. You're kind of just dicking around based off something that came up that would be fun and easy to play around with for a few minutes, but hasn't been touched in previous scenes. There's a few different varieties of group games, and they pretty well defined in terms of how they should be played, as opposed to the game of a scene, which is a fluid concept more than anything.  If you're interested in learning more about improv and you don't have access to a school (or don't currently have the money for it), pick up the Comedy Improvisation Manual (the book that Besser is always plugging). It's very thorough in explaining improv concepts and it doesn't assume any prior knowledge of the subject."
Earwolf,3b1gs3,RedFrogMario,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"That's a great explanation, thanks! I've been considering getting the UCB manual for awhile. I don't really have an interest in doing improv but, like everyone else here I'm sure, I'm a dork for comedy and I just like knowing how it works."
Earwolf,3b1gs3,86themayo,3,Thu Jun 25 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"The game is probably the hardest part for people to grasp. It can be almost anything. It's just a way to explore the suggestion further without having to do a linear scene. It can be weird, explorative, or whatever you want. Like one time in a class, the suggestion was dirty or something and a guy came out and said ""I haven't showered in weeks."" And I came out and hugged him and said ""I'm dirt"", and then others followed suit and he would try to shrug us off as best he could."
Earwolf,3b1gs3,RedFrogMario,3,Thu Jun 25 13:20:38 2015 UTC,"What you're describing is the ""group game"" part of the Harold. I think nicemaker is actually asking about the ""game of the scene,"" not group games.  The simplest definition of the game of the scene is probably that it's the thing that's funny about the scene."
Earwolf,3b1gs3,ReliableSource,2,Thu Jun 25 14:56:17 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. That's another thing I think people have a problem with.
Earwolf,3b1gs3,katiebug88,3,Thu Jun 25 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"The loose definition I hear most is that the game is an unusual thing in an otherwise grounded scene that is then heightened for comedy. Like, Don Dimelo is a director of children's theater, but the game of his character is that he's a depraved pervert who wants to inject porn into his productions, so a lot of the comedy comes from exploring that."
Earwolf,3b1gs3,katiebug88,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"different theaters tend to play game a little differently, but I think the simplest way to describe it is the unusual behavior that's repeated throughout the beats"
Earwolf,3b1gs3,daehx,3,Fri Jun 26 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"I think the Harold is way more magical to watch without knowing the structure- people are blown away by how you know when to do a second/third beat, how everyone knows when to all come out for a group game, and how those connections just magically pop into your head. I think the structure is only good if you need/want to perform them."

Earwolf,3b0l97,ShoBeaut,5,Thu Jun 25 01:11:29 2015 UTC,"I started listening about 2 or 3 years ago, and after a while I went back and started from the beginning.  Hearing Reggie do the CBB theme we all know and love as a last resort, and Nick Kroll's ""the wolf dead"" randomly in an episode are mind blowing after them being such staples in my head."
Earwolf,3b0l97,Pluppets,11,Thu Jun 25 12:12:21 2015 UTC,"I heard about CBB and then got immediately hooked around episode 90 or so, then went back and started from the beginning. It's obviously a much more daunting task at this point, but the show as a whole is so worth it. It's been such an integral part of my life over the past several years, seeing Scott and all the characters grow. A lot of the early eps are just as good or better. Do it."
Earwolf,3b0l97,Memphish_Boognish,5,Thu Jun 25 01:41:28 2015 UTC,Done and done. I'll make a post if I ever do finish all the episodes.
Earwolf,3b0l97,hdlsa,7,Thu Jun 25 01:46:35 2015 UTC,Ive listened to about 95% or them. I started from numero uno about a year ago and slowly worked my way up. I have skipped a few that just did not interest me in the least. I still have a few left I havent touched yet.   I would say it is definitely worth doing. Most of the older eps are brilliant and its fun to see both the podcast and scott grow a bit in the process. Its also interesting to see how pop culture events of the last 5-6 years have impacted the show.
Earwolf,3b0l97,coolest_username,7,Thu Jun 25 01:58:19 2015 UTC,"Yup, every single live show from the Earwolf store as well"
Earwolf,3b0l97,advancedman,7,Thu Jun 25 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"I started listening to CBB/CDR since the second episode or so, I think the early episodes were some of the best. Scott put a little more effort into preparing segments like Alive or Dead, Hollywood Facts, Weirder Scott songs, Entourage update, or fake song interviews. You could tell that guests came in with prepared bits for their characters as well, now they just come in with a vague premise and their development is almost completely fueled by ""yes-anding"" with Scott. It was also fun to listen to real guests struggle to discern whether games like WYR or Dead-or-Alive were serious or not.  Now that Scott has his show and is a lot more successful, he clearly has less time to devote to that sort of stuff. Still a huge fan, but I definitely miss the old format."
Earwolf,3b0l97,under_chemist,6,Thu Jun 25 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"The way you put this definitely makes it seem like Hollywood Handbook is a reincarnation of those old CDR days, which I don't think is a bad comparison at all."
Earwolf,3b0l97,williamana_jones,3,Thu Jun 25 05:16:23 2015 UTC,Yup. As with any podcast there are weaker episodes and stronger episodes through the run but the batting average has been pretty high since since the beginning with CBB/CDR.

Earwolf,3b0l97,williamana_jones,2,Thu Jun 25 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"Well in the early days Scott wasn't always hosting, Cyber Thug would come in and take over the show gangsta style. I can't believe Scott hasn't brought CT & Miles Archer back in years. Their episode with Jerry O'Connell & Nick Kroll is still one of my favorites. Not sure if that's the one where Miles Archer raps, but if not that CT ep was fantastic as well."

The most trouble I remember having was when Chris Hardwick guest hosted and it was talk about the craft of comedy, not even the same format, really. But anyway, I loved how angry Cyber was.

But Tony never shows up in the episode and Andi only makes references top him, along with committing suicide by challenging Tony to a fight."

Earwolf,3b0kmw,DoctorDingDong,2,Thu Jun 25 03:44:37 2015 UTC,"He just had the episode where he was the Royal Watcher on episode 350.  But I think before that was the ""Oh, Golly!  You Devil!"" episode, so he's really been spacing out his appearances lately."
Earwolf,3b0kmw,-BilboFraggins,2,Thu Jun 25 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, true I forgot about that one. While it's a shame it means less Andy for us, the good news is I think it's because he's finally taking off. He has his own show on Comedy Central now and plays several minorish roles on big shows like the Doctor on Silicon Valley."
Earwolf,3b0kmw,DoctorDingDong,2,Thu Jun 25 03:57:45 2015 UTC,Please tell me you're talking about Review.
Earwolf,3b0kmw,-BilboFraggins,3,Thu Jun 25 04:10:44 2015 UTC,I think I am. Is there another Andy Daly show out there I don't know of?
Earwolf,3b0kmw,DoctorDingDong,3,Thu Jun 25 04:13:15 2015 UTC,That's what I was wondering.  Am I completely unplugged from Review?  I never heard that it got a second season.  Edit:  Internet told me that it returns July 30.  Feels good.
Earwolf,3b0kmw,-BilboFraggins,2,Thu Jun 25 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude, I'm psyched. I actually probably wouldn't have watched beyond an episode or two if it was anyone else, but by the end I was actually so attached to that character in a way I never expected. I won't include any spoilers but I really genuinely want everything to work out for him on the show."
Earwolf,3b0kmw,kuhanluke,2,Thu Jun 25 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"My very first Andy Daly episode was ""Oh Golly! You Devil!"" It still plays. Although that may have something to do with my specific sensibilities."

Earwolf,3b0kmw,technicalityNDBO,3,Fri Jun 26 04:26:20 2015 UTC,"Very important to listen to every episode featuring: Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Daly, James Adomian, Seth Morris, Jessica St. Clair, Brendon Small, Brett Gelman, Lauren Lapkus, Harris Wittels, Neil Campbell, Jon Gabrus, Nick Kroll, Matt Gourley, Claudia O'Doherty, & Horatio Sanz.   This should fill you in on 99% of the meat of the ongoing jokes and canon of CBB.

Earwolf,3b0kmw,Splendor78,4,Thu Jun 25 13:27:03 2015 UTC,The best-ofs are a good place to start.
Earwolf,3b0kmw,-BilboFraggins,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"Like people are saying, there's almost no bad episode to start with.   However, there are some names that tend to guarantee great episodes. I'd say anything with PFT (paul f tompkins), Andy Daly, Harris Wittels, Lauren Lapkus or Brendan Small are surefire great and extremely accessible episodes.   However, the only real bit of advice I'd have is looking up characters on the CBB wiki to see the order of appearance. Guys like CakeBoss or Cactus Tony are so much more entertaining if you watch them in order. (Not saying everything has to be in order, but listening to something like the hundo with Jason and Daly would be a mistake without being introduced to the characters beforehand.)  Hope that wasn't too gibberish, comment or message me with any questions, always love getting more people into CBB."
Earwolf,3b0kmw,-BilboFraggins,3,Thu Jun 25 03:30:28 2015 UTC,"And if you want something out of the guaranteed character list to start, I'd highly recommend ep 118 ""Hologram Toes"" with Eddie Pepitone."

Earwolf,3azmt9,PinkPompadour,7,Wed Jun 24 20:28:02 2015 UTC,Great episode! Deadwood is one of my favorites. Makes me love Matt even more.

Earwolf,3b0dss,laurz,3,Wed Jun 24 23:24:18 2015 UTC,"I love I4H, but don't rob yourself of seeing the other acts. There's going to be some fantastic improv going on, and as much as I love podcasts, you will pretty much get the same experience from the recording as you will the live show. Go for a little bit, for sure, but Cardinal Redbird, The Dragons, Rococo, and Landlord are all going up during that 4 hour window. They're all LA Harold teams and are as good as some of the premium shows."
Earwolf,3b0dss,Antonton,2,Thu Jun 25 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"Last year the LA teams were rockin'. I couldn't get into Chelsea till I had a show on Sunday, and I was happy I focussed on LA teams instead of trying to wait in line for bigger name shows."
Earwolf,3b0dss,excusado,2,Thu Jun 25 01:27:49 2015 UTC,I was able to get a ticket to the Silicon Valley show on Friday but unfortunately that's the only one I'm able to make it to. Can't wait though.
Earwolf,3b0dss,Pierce2089,2,Thu Jun 25 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"Even if it is the only one you'll see, seems like it will be a great one. :)"
Earwolf,3b0dss,GilliMarshall,2,Thu Jun 25 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"Every year I'm determined to go to DCM but unfortunately never know anyone thats interested in comedy (I know, yikes!). I always feel uncomfortable about going alone (something about being totally sleep deprived and alone in a strange city as a girl makes the festival seem less inviting/safe/fun).   I guess what I'm saying here is, have fun and I'm super jealous!!!"
Earwolf,3b0dss,excusado,3,Thu Jun 25 01:00:49 2015 UTC,"You should go! No one will have any idea that you're alone! You'll make friends quickly! Just stand in line and chat with people. I've met so many interesting people from around the country at DCM, including Sam Levine! Seriously, lots of improvisers roam around alone because everyone gets smashed and at some point you lose your friends. Also if you're alone in a theater it's dark, no one will know you're by yourself. Please trust me on this, I've gone to TONS of shows by myself and I've made friends that way! (Sorry for being so enthusiastic, I just started a round of prednisone and this is how I get)."
Earwolf,3b0dss,potatohead3,2,Thu Jun 25 01:26:42 2015 UTC,"I went by myself & consider myself pretty shy and struck up lots of conversations with people, you kind of have to if you're gonna be in line for 1-5 hrs with them. Also, you don't have to go to so many things that you get sleep deprived, i got a full 7-8 hrs every night. And new york city is easy as fuck to navigate because the streets are numbered so as long as you know the cross streets of where youre going it's easy to get around. I think I felt ok taking the subway cus I'm used to taking the metro in dc tho, that helped me a little. Try it I had so much fun !!!!"

It looked like such an amazing lineup"
Earwolf,3b0dss,potatohead3,2,Tue Jun 30 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yay! Also, now that I've done this once and feel more comfortable maybe I could do a small quick /r/earwolf meetup there next year?   I saw so much, a few of my favorites were Cast of Silicon Valley that was just Thomas Middleditch and Zach Woods it was spectacular Middleditch made me laugh so hard and Zach is such a talented improviser, Blindfolded with Adam Pally, Gil Ozeri, Middleditch they were all blindfolded and grabbing onto each other / falling over/ not understanding each other, Play by Play which was 4 people announcing the improv strategy as scenes were going on- Zouks was in that. So many more, I laughed so much."
Earwolf,3b0dss,GilliMarshall,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:09:10 2015 UTC,"I'd so be down for an /r/earwolf meetup! Has one happened yet? I'm in the New England area, so DCM next year and the like would be perfect for one for me. Plus, one of the best things about seeing shows is being able to get drinks/talk and bond over it with others afterwards.  That sounds like the perfect group, honestly. I've been so amazed with Woods as an improviser with his ASSSCAT shows that anything with him is entertaining. And Zouks is always perfect"
Earwolf,3b0dss,potatohead3,2,Tue Jun 30 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know if one has happened, but it would be fun :) & I also saw Zouks in Asscat and got a chance to shout his name when he came out on stage which made me so happy."
Earwolf,3b0dss,ribbie_m,2,Tue Jun 30 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"This will be my first time going. There are a lot of shows I want to see like Five Dudes and Middleditch + Schwartz, but I'm sort of expecting some to have ridiculous lines so I'll probably hop into whatever show is going on. Any tips or advice?  Also I bought two tickets for Gravid Water on Saturday, but my friend can't make it anymore, so if anyone is interested, let me know! Free of charge."
Earwolf,3b0dss,excusado,3,Thu Jun 25 01:20:19 2015 UTC,"Gravid Water is the tits! I'd take you up on this but I have a shitty non-improv commitment Saturday night.   Tips: Drink lots of water, bathe regularly, bring sunscreen (lines) and a phone charger, download the DCM app, use the #. Lots of good stuff going on in the East Village Saturday. Get some soft serve at the McDonald's by UCB Chelsea. Have a spicy slice at Two Boots. If you're a performer, they serve lunch in the party space in the afternoon, and it's a nice air conditioned place to crash out during the day. Try to hit Krompf Breakfast Sunday morning.   Last tip - if you can't get into the Finland show Saturday morning, they're performing at Treehouse Thursday night at 10. All the improvisers in Finland will be there! All 12 of them!   Most of all - treasure this weekend. You only lose your DCM virginity once."

Harold teams are a must: Rococo, Outside Dog, Landlord, Solid Gold Forever, DunkTank, Cardinal Redbird, and The Dragons are the LA teams, I'm sure the NYC teams will be performing but I don't know who they are.  I went to the DCM Preview Show last weekend, which is a show in LA where they preview some of the weird artsy stuff that /u/girlsgoneoscarwilde mentioned. They all made me laugh, but Definitely Not Cops was my favorite."

But I wouldn't stay for 4 hours. 1 hour is FINE! Just leave when you get tired.   But please note - it will likely be difficult to get into I4H, even if it's at The Beast. (I'm not doing DCM this year so I haven't checked the schedule). So get in line early early early and plant your butt down in a seat."

The best parts were the times when no one was there at 3 AM and I saw some weird art house shit.  Make sure to do that.  My favorite set ended up being a two man group from the UCB Billy Joel themed sketch show called Billy Joel is Better Than The Beatles.  Did they do any improv?  Nope.  Just two guys arguing with an audience about why Billy Joel is better than the Beatles.  Loved every stupid second of it."
Earwolf,3b0dss,awkwardshoelace,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:20:26 2015 UTC,So spending time in lines for shows you didn't get to see- how does one prevent this from happening?  They don't tell you early on that you won't get in?
Earwolf,3b0dss,oshoney,3,Thu Jun 25 02:34:00 2015 UTC,"Here's the way the marathon works - lets say you're at the UCB Chelsea theater.  It's 2:30, and the show you wanna see is at 4.  There's a very small chance you're getting in because the line is down the block.  Why is it down the block?  Because the people who were standing in line since 9 AM are inside, and they're not leaving until the theater makes the entire audience leave so they can clean every 8 hours or so.  If there's a show you've gotta see, get there early and make sure you'll be there before or after a theater cleaning."

Earwolf,3avye5,ELBdelorean,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:59:24 2015 UTC,"I did! I've listened to Murmur and Automatic for the People so far and have been really enjoying them. The reason that I have been putting off listening to them for so long is that Michael Stipe's vocals just haven't been my thing. But listening to Murmur first, where I guess his vocals are much more toned down definitely was the best choice. Plus I already knew most of Automatic for the People cause half of that album is singles."
Earwolf,3avye5,L_Hayden,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:15:09 2015 UTC,"Hm, toned down in what way? I think New Adventures has a really cool sound and his vocals aren't too crazy on it.

FURTHER EDIT I had some anxiety that maybe you didn't leave them off, but haven't listened to the Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project and U Talkin U2 to Me? Those are essential before anything else in this thread as a fan of LA improv. I also love Who Charted? but it isn't quite an improv podcast and you need to settle in and get acquainted with the hosts a bit"
Earwolf,3awx1k,nohorseman,3,Wed Jun 24 04:59:13 2015 UTC,"I have finished Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project, and listened to Improv  4 Humans, but have trouble getting into it. I'll give it another go.   I loathe Who Charted? I tried, and I like Kulap, but Howard is just weird and not funny to me at all. I am sure people love him, but he simply is not for me.   Thank you for the suggestions though!"
Earwolf,3awx1k,Michael__Pemulis,8,Wed Jun 24 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of other great podcasts, yea! It is just a question of how strictly 'earwolf-related'.  For example Pistol Shrimps Radio is excellent and features some Earwolf crossover, but is notably different in format than what you listed. Same goes with Superego (which I would put above TAH, but they're also somewhat similar). Doug Loves Movies is another. I also love Welcome to Night Vale for what it is worth.  That all being said there is a whole other world in non-comedy podcasts. They barely get talked about here (and I get why, I have always considered them two similar but separate genres). NPR's How To Do Everything is virtually Hollywood Handbook but semi-serious and not about showbiz at all. I really enjoy a lot of other public radio podcasts (This American Life, Wait Wait, Planet Money, etc) and all three of the Gimlet media shows. Just depends on what you like!  (I also have to plug Dan Carlin's Hardcore History. It is definitely my favorite non-comedy podcast.)"
Earwolf,3awx1k,sevillianrites,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"From Gimlet, add on Mystery Show. It's brand new but it's already becoming one of my favorites. It's so off-beat and interesting."
Earwolf,3awx1k,Michael__Pemulis,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:00:17 2015 UTC,"I said 'all three Gimlet media shows' which includes Mystery Show. Reply All is probably my favorite (when the episodes are good like the most recent installment which was extremely moving) but I'm excited to see where Mystery Show can go, the belt buckle episode was so good."
Earwolf,3awx1k,Ciandotmov,8,Wed Jun 24 16:09:31 2015 UTC,I quite like If I Were You with Jake and Amir. Featuring earwolf guests like Ben Scwartz and Thomas Middleditch.

Earwolf,3awx1k,thommmmm,6,Wed Jun 24 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Best Show with Tom Scharpling. It's a three hour call-in show that's been around since the early 2000s. There's a fair amount of Earwolf crossover (PFT used to be a regular caller until he and Scharpling had a total falling out four years ago). It has an East Coast sensibility  that I enjoy as a contrast to the LA-centric podcast circuit.   Also I recommend Call Chelsea Peritti, The Dollop, The Great Debates, and Weird Adults."
Earwolf,3awx1k,jmg089,3,Wed Jun 24 13:32:46 2015 UTC,"Outside of CBB, I feel like I reference Call Chelsea Peretti a lot. Her asking, ""Is that relatable?"" is hilarious to me."

It's just two Vancouver comedians chatting with a guest (usually another Vancouver comedian I've never heard of), followed by a segment called Overheards where they read emails and play calls from listeners describing weird bits of overheard dialogue.  A good starting point would be some episodes with listener and frequent guest Paul F.

Earwolf,3awx1k,arlencanhang,2,Wed Jun 24 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"Not a huge amount of crossover with Earwolf, but in terms of how much I've listened to it and how it's influenced my taste for podcasts, I would say The Bone Zone is my favorite podcast. Hosts Brendon Walsh and Randy Liedtke have appeared on the CBB podcast and show, respectively. It's unrepentantly goofy and crass.  I also like Harmontown and Duncan Trussell's Family Hour a lot, but for the most part I tend to stick with Earwolf. Scott Anchorman is the king of comedy p-casting."

I think that was to be around Christmas...  And he made some off the cuff reference to cleaning out Dragon Manor earlier in the year too, right? [I'll never be able to find it, but it was probably when talking about the bin placement...]  He's also talked about kids more than before, and had the Choctaw/Cherokee business idea a while back. That gave him another excuse to mention that he 'knows a Choctaw'...  So, Australia's moved into Dragon Manor? That's my main guess/hope."

Earwolf,3as4jy,requisite_monocle,6,Tue Jun 23 01:51:27 2015 UTC,"It's something I've been thinking about doing, I've just been busy with the re-listening and editing of the Hollywood Handbook wiki.  I think ideally we could make a thread and have it stickied for like a week for each show that way it gets maximum visibility.   Then of course once it's done to put it in the sidebar. Either way I agree."
Earwolf,3as4jy,Slayner,2,Tue Jun 23 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"I figured that we have all kind of thought about it given how this forum is usally really good about answering people's questions. Sticking thing sounds awesome! Can't wait to have you as a mod. I figured we all might not have the time, but something we could think about when we are bored."
Earwolf,3as4jy,Slayner,2,Tue Jun 23 02:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I fully agree. Plus having a thread stickied up top would take out a lot of the work from most people, since it'd be the whole community doing it with minimal effort basically."
Earwolf,3as4jy,steampunkjesus,3,Tue Jun 23 02:08:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is a fantastic idea. I am hooked, but I will not be crooked.   I'm thinking that the best way to go about creating the ""Where to start"" would be a poll to determine which episode we think is the best entry point for a new listener for each of the major podcasts."
Earwolf,3as4jy,drnukjam,2,Tue Jun 23 15:01:36 2015 UTC,"I would argue that it's relatively easy on where to start with most earwolf podcasts, which is to say just pick episodes with guests that you already enjoy (or in HDTGM's case, films you've maybe seen), and then once they've got a feel for the type of show start from the beginning / wherever. I do like talking about which episodes hooked us though, as they're all likely to be different. For CBB, mine would be the Jason Mantzoukas / Cactus Tony ep"
Earwolf,3aryaj,jarluch,6,Tue Jun 23 00:56:12 2015 UTC,"Last I remember hearing, all of that is going to happen, but it was being talked about right when one of the mods was getting married and he/she was a bit too preoccupied (with getting married and all) to make the proposed changes. At the moment, I think we are just waiting for this mod to have time and let all the wedding rigmarole settle down."

I'm really into the whole comedy scene and honestly have NO clue who they were talking about. The only other improv podcast that I really know of is Jimmy Carrane, but I don't know why he would talk shit about the UCB as I think he has people from there on his show sometimes."

I listen to every ep of CBB, Hollywood Handbook, and HDTGM, so those are automatically downloaded at 6am so I have them when I wake up.

Earwolf,3aovd7,TvsPhil,9,Mon Jun 22 14:35:50 2015 UTC,I enjoyed this. Victor and Tiny really shine when they're prodded a bit like Scott always asking Tiny to Let Victor talk(which I noticed Brendon likes to have Tiny do most of the talking and I kind of assumed it was an easier voice to do for long periods. Him being the manager just naturally works) and asking them.for more info on their comedy show. Loved the image of them flying above the crowd hitting every single person. Betsy was good too. I like the occasional short guest segment. They're usually for unfinished or simple characters it seems but you never know what you can get out of them.(Joe Wengert's characters seemed to be those third segment guys but they're fan favorites) I do enjoy when Scott gives Natasha a hard time. It can be fun.

I just can't wrap my head around whether it's in any way legit or not, and if it is how they can justify putting this ""Spiritual belief"" system behind such a steep paywall.  Anyway, great ep! and a bonus ep on thurs... maybe it will be a surprise guest Obama!

Earwolf,3aovd7,potatohead3,5,Mon Jun 22 20:47:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I was thinking a lot about this and it caught me up during the show. It's a scam for sure. I'm so disappointed in David Lynch and so many other actors I have learned about thru You Made It Weird that practice TM.  This is how I see it: it helps people just as much as any free or cheaper place would that instructs people in meditation and mantras. These people are just paying 500- 1000 $ minimum to begin doing TM. I had no clue til I listened to this that there were a few mantras that were reused and especially that they would be different because of age and gender. Especially gender, as it's a social construct that has no place separating people in the practice of meditation. TM is also literally trademarked, which is gross to me.  Another tidbit: the person who started the TM movement is Maharishi Mahesh Yogi & he was associated with the Beatles for a while, training them in private sessions. The Beatles split from him after hearing of him making inappropriate sexual advances on someone. Then they wrote the song ""Sexy Sadie"" about him."
Earwolf,3aovd7,Pluppets,2,Mon Jun 22 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting tidbit.

Earwolf,3aovd7,8eat-mesa,-8,Tue Jun 23 00:05:16 2015 UTC,"""well educated""? where? in liberal schools where you only get a good grade if you parrot back the bullshit shoved down your throat by liberal Jewish professors? is THAT what ""well educated"" means?  ""you are only educated and intelligent if you agree with everything I say!""  so much for intellectual diversity"
Earwolf,3aovd7,kirk88,4,Tue Jun 23 17:21:06 2015 UTC,Hahahahaha. I love how you say I spew liberal ideology why you yourself are just shitting forth a torrential amount of racial charged conservative bullshit. You are a sad little man who lives in a sad little world where he couldn't live in the real world due too his views be so warped. You will probably be undone by your own hubris and ignorance so justifying anymore of a response would be a waste of my time.

Earwolf,3aovd7,Tofuboy,30,Mon Jun 22 11:49:23 2015 UTC,guys... heynong man?
Earwolf,3aoqv3,cameronxylo,24,Mon Jun 22 07:04:14 2015 UTC,I admired his candor and outlook. I'm not always satisfied with his actions as a politician but he seems like a good guy and the conversation was thoughtful and interesting.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,JasmineForsythe,15,Mon Jun 22 13:42:29 2015 UTC,I think it's incredibly interesting.  I can see this podcast being played in classrooms in a hundred years as a glimpse into the early 21st century.  Imagine if we could hear a (relatively) normal conversation with Theodore Roosevelt.  I don't think it's an exaggeration to say this is the most important podcast ever.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,KennyGardner,5,Tue Jun 23 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"I think you're totally right. It definitely is a watershed moment in podcasting history and huge acknowledgement of its legitimacy as a medium. Even though I'm not a Obama supporter, it felt nice that the president was speaking to me through my terms, on one of my favorite shows. There was some truth to him talking about coming onto podcast and newer mediums as a way to reach cynical voters, and it actually seems authentic because he's not up for reelection."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,Ed_Sullivision,30,Tue Jun 23 05:30:50 2015 UTC,"I've heard of 'Hail to the Chief,' but 'Hail to the Cat Ranch?'"
Earwolf,3aoqv3,pdxsean,10,Mon Jun 22 08:39:52 2015 UTC,It's a solid listen. I was immediately tickled when he accused Maron for being narcissistic with all his portraits pasted in the garage.  I'd like to hear this interview again after Obama's out of the White House. I'm sure he'd be a lot more candid.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,ishmael84,9,Mon Jun 22 20:31:29 2015 UTC,Didn't even ask Obama what his rank on the casting call was. C-
Earwolf,3aoqv3,FeaturingPitbull,20,Mon Jun 22 21:22:45 2015 UTC,"This turned out way better than I expected. Obama is well into his second term so he's pretty good at knowing what or what not to say, but I was happy with how frank (Hey, Let's be Frank) and seemingly unguarded he was. He definitely went into ""politician mode"" on some of the more policy related questions and I was happy that Marc pressed him for substantive answers when necessary.   Also it's hilarious that the media seems to running with him saying the N-word during the interview as the main takeaway."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,Ed_Sullivision,5,Mon Jun 22 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"Seriously how the fuck is everyone so obsessed over Obama using that word.  He's the fucking president and he used the word academically, and not to attack people.  I would mention that he's also black, but that's irrelevant, because it shouldn't be news if anyone uses ""Nigger"" if they're discussing it as a word."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,sje46,7,Tue Jun 23 03:12:04 2015 UTC,"This is really... I don't know how else to say it, it's cool.    I was hoping for more of the show to be a personal conversation, but it was still interesting to hear him speak about these issues with Marc."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,siriusthinking,13,Mon Jun 22 21:06:06 2015 UTC,First time ever I'm listening to anything other than CBB first thing Monday morning. And I'm not even American!

Earwolf,3aoqv3,digitall565,4,Mon Jun 22 15:26:26 2015 UTC,"When this was announced, I was trying to figure out why (I guess everyone was). Obviously, it's to be fresh and likeable an show America an unfiltered side of Obama. I started to understand that a big reason this interview was done was to convince mild dissenters, people who are a little more left wing than Obama. I'd say that Marc's core group of listeners has got to be a pretty cynical, angry bunch b/c they relate to Marc (and can put up with the airing of dirty laundry Marc does about his grudges, etc.) I feel like this could change some of those people's minds. I didn't see my opinion of Obama being affected in any way by this interview, but maybe that was too much to hope for."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,potatohead3,7,Mon Jun 22 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"I started to understand that a big reason this interview was done was to convince mild dissenters, people who are a little more left wing than Obama.   I don't think that was the motivation, especially because Obama doesn't have to win another election If the motivation was to get young, cynical, disengaged people into politics then they succeeded with me. I did some light 2016 research this morning, it reminded me that I do actually care who my president is."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,mm825,3,Mon Jun 22 23:24:39 2015 UTC,He's still the functioning president for over a year I think he wants people to support him up until the end.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,potatohead3,3,Mon Jun 22 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"i agree, i think his aim was to convince left-wing voters that his presidency wasn't a failure and that they shouldn't lose hope in the political process. he might not have to win another election, but he still wants people to vote democratic in 2016.   that being said, i really enjoyed the interview, and it indeed made me reflect on the progress that has been made in the past 8 years. so i guess the propaganda worked for me!"
Earwolf,3aoqv3,dumatin,19,Tue Jun 23 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"I remember, 5, 6? years ago first listening to CDR and Wtf just starting and not really getting it.    Even though Hot Saucerman got to Barack Hussein Obamacare first, I'm seriously proud of Marc.   His trajectory of those first episodes talking about stealing from the Whole Foods deli while sneaking in to the bankrupt Air America studios to record the show, to the ground breaking first 200/establishment of the cat ranch, to his TV show, to now POTUS going to his garage in highland park to record an episode.  He got Obama before Lorne Michaels and Jon Stewart."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,jumbotron9000,2,Mon Jun 22 07:49:56 2015 UTC,stewart and maron dont like each other.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,HipGuide,11,Mon Jun 22 09:13:37 2015 UTC,Which is why it would make for a great interview.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,notalek,2,Mon Jun 22 13:35:56 2015 UTC,"Relatively off-topic, but I just listened to the Never Not Funny episode with Paul Sheer, their ""Maron moment"" was wildly entertaining for me."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,pattycigs,5,Mon Jun 22 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're being serious with the last line or not, so I'm going to risk it. Obama was on SNL for the cold open on 07 and has been on The Daily Show 6 or 7 times (at least twice as president)."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,kgriffin44,19,Mon Jun 22 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, he meant maron got to interview Obama before He got to interview Lorne michaels and john Stewart. Not the other way around.   Edit: bad grammar. Also sorry for the random capitalization, on mobile."
Earwolf,3aoqv3,Cantkillabullmoose,6,Mon Jun 22 13:14:38 2015 UTC,Ooooooooooooh. Everything makes sense now.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,kgriffin44,0,Mon Jun 22 13:17:19 2015 UTC,It's my bad for not clearly wording my sentiment.
Earwolf,3aoqv3,jumbotron9000,6,Mon Jun 22 13:43:02 2015 UTC,It's like 90-10 Lorne. He's Marc's white whale.

Earwolf,3aovor,JasonGrayson,7,Mon Jun 22 08:17:11 2015 UTC,I find it a little strange for Colin Hanks to be talking about worrying about paying a bill. I guess that was good parenting from Tom Hanks!
Earwolf,3aovor,credibit,2,Tue Jun 23 02:19:01 2015 UTC,I have never met the man in person so maybe he is just good at curating his image but he seems ridiculously normal for having had an ultra famous parent. Maybe celebrities are people too? I'd like to think not but who knows.
Earwolf,3aovor,snobbysnob,2,Tue Jun 23 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"Have you ever heard stories about Tom Hanks? They're always good, especially the one about how he invited a taxi driver to a Broadway show just because the guy gave him a ride despite the driver's shift ending soon. Hanks seems relatable and cool as hell, I guess it rubbed off on Colin!"

Earwolf,3anll1,shazbotica,22,Mon Jun 22 00:14:34 2015 UTC,I think Ben Schwartz has said that the reason he is able to get people who haven't improvised before to agree to come on his show is because he promises that it won't be recorded.
Earwolf,3anll1,credibit,5,Mon Jun 22 01:42:53 2015 UTC,That's a good point. There must be something freeing as a performer knowing that it will not live on forever.
Earwolf,3anll1,shazbotica,8,Mon Jun 22 01:49:57 2015 UTC,I'd pay to see Blake in more comedy without these great improvs. I asked Peter Mehlman of Seinfeld note when he came by University of Maryland when I was in grad school who his favorite comedians were.

Earwolf,3ao5og,SoberKeonClark,12,Mon Jun 22 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of the email-reading section of Not Farts and Pro from this winter. They get to a point where Scott almost has the podcast taping arranged, and then he reads one his emails that says ""so are you all set?"" The rest start laughing and Chelsea says ""That's not everything you wrote."" Scott emphatically responds, ""Uh, yes it is"" and they move on. I considered what word or phrase he could have redacted from his reading, and I figured it was probably ""fag"" or something along those lines -- it's one of the only expressions that makes sense in the context and that Scotty Auk would be embarrassed at having said."
Earwolf,3ao5og,thommmmm,6,Mon Jun 22 12:22:34 2015 UTC,"I assumed the same thing, but I'm pretty sure it was ""nigger"".

Earwolf,3ao5og,jack_sjunior,8,Mon Jun 22 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"In the spirit of friendly debate I'm going to say nah, I don't think Scotty would drop an n-bomb in a private email that included Chelsea P, who is dating Jordan Peele. And I think there's a difference between saying a word like fag in your podcast -- where it is layered in irony -- and using it in a private email, where it's a little more difficult to explain why you would casually use it."

Earwolf,3ao5og,dubtonn,42,Mon Jun 22 20:37:36 2015 UTC,"This isn't specific to Paul or Louis but there's a thing I notice that kind of annoys me in this realm of comedians. I've heard comedians who fall into the spectrum of I guess...alternative comedy say things and get laughs from their fellow comedians that if someone NOT in their circle said, they'd act offended.  (Before I say more, I don't necessarily think the Louis line is funny and I hope Paul is consistent with his criticism) I mean, Nick Kroll has flat out said the 'N' word for a bit and if it was on a less obscure comedy radio show, he would've been eaten alive by social media and fellow comedians, I think. There was a line Harris did once about how strippers voices stay the same register they do at the moment they're molested. He got laughs. Maria Bamford mentioned that Carolla says that line and Scott reacted with disgust.  My point I guess is, I think comedians allow fellow comedians with similar views a pass on what's offensive. If they don't share views than they ""must really believe what they say.""  I would say I just wish there was some consistency but it's human nature to be hypocritical sometimes.  I do believe Paul is probably consistent about that particular type of slur. He seems like he'd call out friends for things he deems offensive.(not that he and Louis are friends) But hey, I think we all have moments of laughing at things we shouldn't.  (That was a lot that was barely on topic)"
Earwolf,3ao5og,TvsPhil,14,Mon Jun 22 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree with this. I don't know if it's confirmation bias or snobbery or friendship or all three but it's definitely noticeable. I mean I'm sure if Daniel Tosh was doing an impression of a black celebrity people would be cringing, but Paul doing it all the time? No problem"
Earwolf,3ao5og,thursdayaug22,8,Mon Jun 22 04:18:46 2015 UTC,Paul is not the only white dude to have done an Ice T impression. It's one of John Mulaney's most popular bits. White dudes have been imitating Bill Cosby since time immemorial. What makes it acceptable is A) they're not making fun of the blackness of the person in question and B) they're not actually doing it in blackface.
Earwolf,3ao5og,fireswater,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:28:59 2015 UTC,"Well I think with Paul's impression part of it is how it's done. None of the joke is ""hey isn't it so funny and quirky that white guy is playing a black guy!"" and he doesn't do blackface or make fun of AAVE or whatever. He's impersonating Ice-T because Ice-T is an interesting/ridiculous person. The characteristics about him that are part of PFT's impersonation have little to do with him being black.  I agree with the general sentiment, though, that these cool comedy folks give each other passes because they ""know they're joking"" or whatever. Context is important, but at the end of the day a lot of times it's just the same basic stereotypical joke and deciding that it's okay because of ""irony"" without really wanting to question it further. I once had to listen to Patton Oswalt go on a rant at a comedy show about how he loved to say the n-word and it wasn't offensive because his black comedians friends were okay with it... Just take a second to think about what you're saying and why you're saying it."
Earwolf,3ao5og,DeusExMachinist,-13,Tue Jun 23 18:33:41 2015 UTC,doing an impression of a black celebrity people would be cringing
Earwolf,3ao5og,ernstrohm96,10,Mon Jun 22 04:33:18 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with intention. Like, in Scott's subconsciousness, he's thinking that Harris is saying it just to go break barriers, but that Carolla is saying it to be disrespectful."
Earwolf,3ao5og,TvsPhil,18,Mon Jun 22 04:25:31 2015 UTC,Yeah but at what point are they just making up the rules as they go along for the people they like and/or what they find funny?  Don't get me wrong there are some comedians who are real mean-spirited jackasses (see: Carolla) but the pot shots seem petty sometimes
Earwolf,3ao5og,ReliableSource,7,Mon Jun 22 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I understand that that's probably what they feel is true. It's like how our friends are allowed to say something offensive as a joke because we know them and they aren't trying to hurt anyone. But then if we assume guilt for someone we aren't friends with, it gets more iffy.   (It should be noted that Carolla's used to be the only podcast I listened to when I first started listening to podcast. I only stopped because I preferred more comedy based podcasts to interviews with athletes and musicians and didn't feel like keeping up with that many.  Despite not agreeing with him on everything, I generally rarely agree with a lot of people's assessments of Carolla . Sure, he's more of a harsher style I guess than the alternative scene. As someone who listened for quite a while, I would argue that I am a person who felt some of the jokes or lines he said weren't meant to be harmful or they had a context necessary. He got in trouble once because Jo Koy, an Asian American comedian did a character on the show who was a stereotypical sounding Asian. Some website thought it was Adam and was offended. The content was no less offensive than Thomas Middleditch, a white actor, doing a stereotypical Asian character. And don't get me started on Andy Kindler's dumb rant about him.)  So that's context for why I may not be personally offended by a divisive figures jokes or lines.  I'm not saying everyone has to agree on what is and isn't offensive. But that maybe context counts toward our reactions sometimes.  (And I apologize for being unable to post without a wall of text)"
Earwolf,3ao5og,TvsPhil,2,Mon Jun 22 05:54:35 2015 UTC,What's this Andy Kindler rant about/where can I find it?
Earwolf,3ao5og,spikey666,2,Mon Jun 22 12:35:12 2015 UTC,It was in his state of the industry address he does. It might be called something different but it's the state of something. Basically he covers comedy mainly in a roast style. It was several years ago now.  Many may agree with that part. I don't.  I have other issues with Kindler like not finding him all that funny to begin with while people say you owe him respect.  But whatever.
Earwolf,3ao5og,TvsPhil,6,Mon Jun 22 13:00:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if we're really going to consider context, a person's character and why they're saying something is an important component. We can't  really ignore someone's history and pretend their words occur in a vacuum. Carolla's past comments regarding women may have left a different impression with Scott than Harris did."
Earwolf,3ao5og,stenchwinslow,5,Mon Jun 22 05:57:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that's probably true.  There was a big uproar once where someone asked Carolla in an interview who was funnier, men or women. And he said men. They ran with it saying he said women aren't funny. There are more men in comedy was his point.  I've heard other comedians cite that as if he said it. I think Adam Pally once implied in a jokey way that Carolla wouldn't hire...maybe it was Casey Wilson... because he didn't think women were funny. The comedy world sounds dramatic.   I'm going to stop because I feel like I'm just defending Carolla, who at most I just think is kinda funny but that's it, instead of my original point."
Earwolf,3ao5og,Virginonimpossible,4,Mon Jun 22 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"Fundamental Attribution error, we only allow for context when it supports our social identity. We all do it to some extent, but I wonder if Scott and PFT have ever listened to an Adomian episode where he pushed boundaries and called him out on it?  Excellent points, man, there is a ton of nuance to this and it's easy to get self righteous only when it serves us."

Earwolf,3ao5og,spacemanoncrack,3,Mon Jun 22 06:05:56 2015 UTC,"I think Harris is an interesting example because he did say a lot of shit that really was just generic white bro comedy, ""edgy"" for the sake of ""edgy"" shit and got a pass because he was in with a certain crowd of people and had the type of attitude/sense of humor that made it seem chill. He went on quite a few Twitter rants about issues that if Tosh or somebody had gone on, they would have been dragged (and Harris did get dragged but not by any comedians). It wasn't ironic, he was just getting away with it because he was genuinely a funny person and had enough redeeming qualities that people excused it. In the last ep of YMIW that he did, he talks about finally getting that ""offensive"" comedy is only okay to you if you're not the one who has to deal with all the shit, like if you're not a part of the group that's the butt of the joke, then it's not your place to say that something is not offensive to them and that they are just being too sensitive.  I say this all as a huge fan of his, but I was always torn on some of his bits that really just weren't funny."
Earwolf,3ao5og,fireswater,2,Tue Jun 23 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"I honestly think being offended is part of the comedy spectrum, whats ok and not ok is all relative."
Earwolf,3ao5og,enalios,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:18:34 2015 UTC,"Are you a straight, white, able-bodied male though? Yes, it is all relative, but for example, if you make a joke about cancer to a cancer patient while you yourself have never had cancer nor has anybody close to you, and then they get upset, it's pretty rude to be like, ""oh, hey, can't you take a joke? You're so easily offended!"" And it might be different if a fellow cancer patient made the same joke, because then it's poking fun at a shared experience. I don't mean that you should never joke about certain topics, but if the butt of a joke is a marginalized group and the humor relies on bigoted stereotypes and/or shock value, it's probably just not that original or funny in the first place.  So I guess I just disagree. And I still, somehow, find a way to enjoy comedy even though I'm ""easily offended."" I think that type of humor is just very status quo, it's not pushing any boundaries because it's the same shit we've all heard a million types, it's like the Fox News of humor. Flipping it around so that the joke isn't on the marginalized group is usually much more original/funny/creative. That's why I think a show like It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is much funnier and original than a show like Family Guy."

I always thought this was the one and Louis talks about how disgusting the word is on his show (which was after).  I was disappointed with Louis because he has bit saying there never being a time when you need to say the N-word which applies exactly the same with the F-word.
Earwolf,3ao5og,Virginonimpossible,5,Mon Jun 22 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"When was this? He has a large chunk from Chewed Up about the N-word, specifically about not calling it ""the N-word"" and just using the word. And then he proceeds to use it several times."
Earwolf,3ao5og,thursdayaug22,2,Mon Jun 22 05:51:19 2015 UTC,"I am not sure, I have thought this for years though. There is a chance I am wrong, maybe someone else said it and I related it to Louis bit about the word Faggot.   It was about why do you want to say the word, if it is so offensive to so many people why do you NEED to say it (I'd like to find out where I got it from because it doesn't seem like something Louis would say, could possibly have been on his TV show)."
Earwolf,3ao5og,king_awesome,2,Mon Jun 22 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"No, I know what you're talking about. I seem to remember that bit being in an episode of Louie, but can't source it off the top of my head. Chewed Up just has a lot of really bad bits in retrospect, and he's used his TV show to back of from a lot of things he said in it without having to explicitly say he was wrong."
Earwolf,3ao5og,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,24,Mon Jun 22 16:22:54 2015 UTC,I've suspected that PFT doesn't like Louis C.K. and that it is probably related to how his friend Jen Kirkman has all but named Louis as jerking off in front of female comics in green rooms in the past.

Earwolf,3ao5og,spikey666,6,Tue Jun 23 18:38:15 2015 UTC,"What's weirder if this is true is that she constantly praises him as well. She named him her favorite comedian.  http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/jen-kirkmans-top-ten-stand-up-comedians  Conversely, could this be why she wouldn't name him? Either way why would she talk so highly of someone who did that to her even if she did love his work?"
Earwolf,3ao5og,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,10,Mon Jun 22 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"It looks like that interview was a few years ago, so maybe she didn't know about it then?  She also could be talking about another comic in the podcast (however unlikely that may be)."
Earwolf,3ao5og,thelostdolphin,12,Mon Jun 22 04:19:41 2015 UTC,"She has praised him since then, especially after she asked for that story to be taken down because it was ""incorrect"". She tweeted several nice things about him, called him a friend. Weird situation"
Earwolf,3ao5og,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,4,Mon Jun 22 04:28:55 2015 UTC,"I think she may have tweeted  that she had more or less forgiven the person she talked about in her podcast, and that she didn't like people trying to guess who it was. She was just talking about the shitty things women in comedy go through.   Also, people where just guessing that the person she was talking about was the guy who supposedly jerked off in front of some other female comedians (that itself being based on a blind item on Gawker). She never really said what the person had done to her (it had something to do with being invited to go on tour with the guy, I think).    So I don't know if PFT's dislike of C.K. is personal, or just that he doesn't like the guy's comedic style. Maybe a combination."

Earwolf,3ao5og,KingDongBundy,3,Mon Jun 22 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"PFT is close friends with Jen Kirkman. She was pretty clearly talking about CK in that podcast ep, I just don't think she ever expected it to blow up like it has. She didn't talk about that on her podcast as like, ""today I'm exposing a famous comedy creep!"", she was using an anecdote from her life to make a point about something else while not naming the guy in question. So I'm not surprised she's shutting down about it now because as she says she's been told flat-out ""if you name this guy it will end your career"" (maybe it will and maybe it won't but when she's hearing that from her manager or whoever...). But, it's apparently a big open secret anyway, PFT's been around forever so he's probably heard the rumor even aside from the fact that he's good friends with Jen Kirkman (and many other female comedians), he's mad on behalf of his friend, he can't really come out and say ""this guy's for sure done this creepy shit,"" but he wants people who get what he's referencing to know where he stands on the matter.   ETA plus Rhea Butcher, a female comic, replying ""you and me both!"" really cements for me that that's definitely what they're both talking about"
Earwolf,3ao5og,mullacc,13,Mon Jun 22 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"Louis rises above it most of the time, but I still think of him as part of the Opie & Anthony crew of comedians. Along with guys like Jim Norton, Nick DiPaolo, Robert Kelly, Rich Vos and the late Patrice O'Neal.   There's a huge cultural divide between that group and the (now) LA-centric group of comics who mostly have roots with UCB, Mr. Show or the Holy City Zoo.  PFT is clearly at the core of this group.   CK is one of the few who seems to try to bridge the groups. I'm thinking specifically of his promotion of Tig Notaro.   But where am I going with this? Gang fights."
Earwolf,3ao5og,TweetPoster,3,Mon Jun 22 14:18:40 2015 UTC,i feel like PFT probably (quietly) sides with the coterie of female comedians who feel that Louis CK is a creepy pervert.  especially considering his ties to Southieeee!

Earwolf,3ao5og,8eat-mesa,12,Tue Jun 23 15:24:34 2015 UTC,"I think its more a criticism of the respondents to Branum's tweet. Reminds me of Chris Rock's ""Niggas vs. Black People"" bit. He eventually retired it because too many racists were just using it as an excuse to say the N-word."
Earwolf,3ao5og,DocSub,2,Mon Jun 22 03:49:04 2015 UTC,"Oh certainly, but this is coupled with retweet of that tweet much earlier."
Earwolf,3ao5og,ivtecdoyou,2,Mon Jun 22 05:53:19 2015 UTC,It's kind of amazing that even Louis CK wouldn't be able to get away with that bit these days. That word is just completely off limits now.
Earwolf,3ao5og,thursdayaug22,3,Mon Jun 22 05:55:07 2015 UTC,Isn't that an old Louie CK bit? Like from 5+ years ago?
Earwolf,3ao5og,hamishwilson,8,Mon Jun 22 14:47:16 2015 UTC,I think that is an okay joke. He is taking the power out of the word and making comedy out of it.
Earwolf,3ao5og,CurtBaboon,-2,Mon Jun 22 15:04:50 2015 UTC,It's not his place to do that.
Earwolf,3ao5og,Virginonimpossible,10,Mon Jun 22 05:16:20 2015 UTC,"I think it is. Comedians can comment on society, and most want to help society in some way with their material."
Earwolf,3ao5og,gerradp,2,Mon Jun 22 11:47:20 2015 UTC,"No, I mean it's not his place as a straight guy to decide that a gay slur isn't offensive anymore."
Earwolf,3ao5og,Virginonimpossible,5,Mon Jun 22 12:15:00 2015 UTC,"Good, because he's not.  He's pointing out that it's lost meaning in current culture, which was true when he was making that joke. It had become very common for people to just use the word ""faggot"" to call out exactly what he said, 'whiny, and annoying people'.  Now the word has made a resurgence in offending people, so the joke doesn't work anymore. There's a reason why the whole room was laughing when he made that bit, it's not because EVERY single person there is homophobic, it's because it was a funny bit that had truth behind it.   CK isn't trying to be some social change advocate taking back the offensive words for the persecuted minority, he's a comedian that's up there to make people laugh, and looking anywhere deeper into it is just a waste of time.   Despite what PFT says, context is ALWAYS important, and that joke had some HEAVY context given the time and surrounding commentary of that bit."
Earwolf,3ao5og,thursdayaug22,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:20:50 2015 UTC,"Are you telling me there was a brief period in 2008 where that word didn't mean ""gay people"" to gay people and homophobes? I mean, the context for that bit is Louis wanted an excuse to use the word for the rest of the routine without anyone calling him out on it. That's the entire context, really."
Earwolf,3ao5og,honermic,2,Mon Jun 22 13:38:48 2015 UTC,"the context for that bit is Louis wanted an excuse to use the word for the rest of the routine without anyone calling him out on it.   That's not context, that's intent. And you really think Louis only wanted to use the word and no one could call him out? Really? It wasn't material to make people laugh?"
Earwolf,3ao5og,Pluppets,8,Mon Jun 22 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"Louie's joke was about pointing out that his definition of faggot isn't a slur against homosexuals, but an insult meant for whiny, annoying people regardless of their sexuality. He's making fun of how loosely people use the word, and how to take power away from it.  So yes, in this instance; context is incredibly important. I get that PFT doesn't do this style of comedy and he doesn't have to like the use of the word, but it's weird that he doesn't get the purpose behind using it.  Besides, Scott Aukerman has used the word on Comedy Bang Bang/UTU2TM as well. Are you to tell me that context isn't important there either?"
Earwolf,3ao5og,CharlizeHeen,16,Tue Jun 23 18:46:05 2015 UTC,"Could you say ""my definition of Nigger is just whiny annoying people""?   I personally disagree with people who say they didn't know what gay/faggot meant so they got used to it just meaning bad in a non-specific way, to be fair though I am younger and from a different country so it is possible that's what they really believe."
Earwolf,3ao5og,gladvillain,4,Mon Jun 22 04:18:17 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting argument either way. I guess I think it should be stricken from casual conversation, but a comedy bit is something else and can do more for the debate than just tossing it around freely.   I respect PFT more than virtually anyone else in comedy, but Louis also tends to be pretty forward thinking in his personal life (even if he does like to push buttons in his act)"
Earwolf,3ao5og,Pluppets,4,Mon Jun 22 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, I am all for saying whatever you want as a comedian but I think intent is just as important as context and I don't think this bit has good intentions, as I have said above if you change the word to Nigger or Retard etc I think most people would see it isn't right, you can't reallt just make up your own definitions and expect people to stop being offended.   Faggot means whiny or annoying because people thought being gay was a bad thing, it is not so we shouldn't use it to mean that."
Earwolf,3ao5og,mullacc,3,Mon Jun 22 08:12:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah the tweet doesn't really make sense to me at all. It just seems like a smug ""yeah, as if..."". Of course the context is important. He can still feel it's gross certainly but that line looks like it came from a Nazi in a vacuum, rather than from the same guy who wrote a TV scene about how ugly that same word is."
Earwolf,3ao5og,Daisy1111,4,Mon Jun 22 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"He wrote that scene years later, after gay comedians talked to him about how offensive the original bit was. And it'd be awesome if everyone realized he backtracked from that bit, but they don't. They consistently use it to justify their use of an awful word."

I remember seeing it on ESPN 2 back in the day, it was the only worthwhile program that ever aired on that network. Go back and watch some old episodes on Youtube, they hold up.   Sklarbro Country was my introduction to Earwolf and I used to like it a lot, but I fell off with it after discovering CBB. Maybe I'll get back into it one day."
Earwolf,3alva2,gugs,11,Sun Jun 21 14:50:53 2015 UTC,I like the sklars. Yes they have dad humor and suck up to their guests sometimes but they play good music and can be funny while talking about sports. They are doing the previews for regal cinemas right now and have a pbs thing going on: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy1Qz7Ek8pc&feature=youtu.be
Earwolf,3alva2,Cantkillabullmoose,8,Sun Jun 21 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"Straight up they seem like some of the nicest guys in the podcasting world. They have great guests. They are so enthusiastic that their excitement for a subject becomes infectious. I'm not a huge sports nut but I could listen to them talk about Jose Canseco for hours. They also have a really great taste in music. Their end-of-the-year music podcast is always a great way to hear new bands. Finally to top it off, Sklarboro County is amazing. Dan Van Kirk is a great co-host and the dumb criminal stories lead to amazing riffs. Solid podcast by solid guys. Also, they were amazing as Reggie's creepy twin sons on CBB."
Earwolf,3alva2,catch_th3m_all,6,Mon Jun 22 02:14:10 2015 UTC,The Sklars are how I got into podcasts because I loved cheap seats. Country eps are hit and miss but County is almost always a great episode no matter who the guest is. DVK is killing it right now and I can't believe he hasn't been on CBB yet as any of his characters.

Earwolf,3al1ge,sevillianrites,10,Sun Jun 21 20:55:47 2015 UTC,I have nothing to say. I was EHH WRONG
Earwolf,3al1ge,Slayner,22,Sun Jun 21 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of names are thrown around as ""not getting it"" like Tom Green or Dane Cook but I don't agree. I think they got it just fine. I mean they were on the show right before being on the podcast and I really doubt Scott makes people fly blind. That being said, one could argue that their particular style doesn't fit the ironic CBB/HH style which is fine. Sometimes the guest just needs to feed the character questions and that works too.  Of course other factors could lead to someone believing a guest didn't get it like butting into character interview time which doesn't necessarily mean they didn't understand what was happening, it just means they aren't used to pulling back.  Heck, I'm sure David Cross gets it but I didn't care at all for his last appearance.   As far as guests who actually didn't get it, the common answer is Ben Stiller. It's been a long time since I heard that episode so I don't remember much about it. I don't remember it being really uncomfortable or anything as I have a low tolerance for that. But it was short."
Earwolf,3al1ge,TvsPhil,43,Sun Jun 21 06:55:08 2015 UTC,"I love David Cross and think he's hilarious, but he's such a goddamn hipster. He would be fine doing the wackiest shit on Mr. Show with no shame, but he can't just play along with a couple dumb games. You know what Scott wants you to do, so quit being a ""too cool for this"" prick and just do it. You're willing to debase yourself by doing Alvin and The Chipmunks, but when your friend promotes your new movie for you, you give fuck-all? Just means that you'll act stupid and goofy for money, but not for your friend."

Earwolf,3al1ge,TheBlackSpank,3,Sun Jun 21 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually saw the Video version of one the Tim CBB episodes. It's hard to tell at times if he's just bored, if its just his character, or if Bill Cosby-Bukowski irritated him. BC-C is a pretty uhh... Strong character to be around I'd imagine."
Earwolf,3al1ge,Khanstant,12,Sun Jun 21 17:58:44 2015 UTC,Tim and John Daly have a good working relationship (at least they did at the time of that episode airing) so I doubt Tim wasnt already familiar with Bill Cosby- Bukowski. Tim jusy excels at playing the stick-in-the-mud ignorant asshole (look at his whole On Cinima persona)   Tim and John even return for their infamous Guy Fierie fight which is hilarious for how straight they both play it.
Earwolf,3al1ge,Pluppets,4,Sun Jun 21 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I think I caught part of that ep but had to finish whatever I was doing and didnt finish it. Maybe I'm projecting some of my feelings about BC-C onto Tim without realizing."
Earwolf,3al1ge,Khanstant,2,Sun Jun 21 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"I think Tim was definitely playing ""not interested"" in BC-C, but he was doing it more for comedic effect rather than genuine distaste."

I get the too cool for school attitude he gives out, but it's no longer something that makes me a fan of his. I actually remember being angry during the episode when David was bitching about 'would you rather' when they spent all their time promoting David's movie.

Earwolf,3al1ge,ultimaxfeelgood,6,Sun Jun 21 07:18:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. Even if it's not something I'm interested in, there's precedence from a long way back of the first part of the show being a standard interview. It's all in who the guest is."
Earwolf,3al1ge,TvsPhil,3,Sun Jun 21 08:10:57 2015 UTC,Agree! I easily listened to all of the Dane Cook ep and enjoyed it the whole way. Not the case for the Tom Green episode
Earwolf,3al1ge,nohorseman,8,Sun Jun 21 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"Tom Green was fine until his dead dog anecdote derailed the whole show. Though Scott did egg the story on so Tom's not entirely to blame.  Dane was fine. Even if you're not a fan of his comedy you have to admit he played along and was generally pleasant. I thought David Cross was doing a bit, but that doesn't mean it was good."

When Tom did his plugs he just started naming cities for about a minute and a half and even scott was getting annoyed (""I really wish you would stop naming cities right now"") I'd still say the episode was overall enjoyable it just gets a tad awkward at the last chunk.

Earwolf,3al1ge,Druidpryde,7,Sun Jun 21 10:15:51 2015 UTC,Jay Mohr makes me want to punch Jay Mohr every time I hear him.
Earwolf,3al1ge,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Sun Jun 21 11:06:39 2015 UTC,The weirdest thing is that (up til then) I had been able to separate out and enjoy more broey comedy and I really liked Jay's podcast
Earwolf,3al1ge,Druidpryde,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:49:51 2015 UTC,"I used to listen to his podcast, but a couple years ago I tapped out, because he's just such an asshole. And not a funny asshole who can rant and rave like Carolla. Just a run of the mill unfunny interupter."
Earwolf,3al1ge,slimjimcharles,8,Sun Jun 21 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Sean and Hayes (...Davenport) and I were hanging out with him once, and wow, you said it. He spilled a drink on Chappie and wouldn't even apologize."
Earwolf,3al1ge,gerradp,3,Sun Jun 21 16:41:15 2015 UTC,The Jay Mohr one is another that I've heard people complain about but I can't remember it being all that bad. Not memorable by any means but I don't remember any uncomfortable moments.
Earwolf,3al1ge,TvsPhil,3,Sun Jun 21 12:12:58 2015 UTC,"Besser disliked him for stepping all over his character (he did a I4H mini-episode about it), but in fairness to Jay it wasn't one of Matt's best. Still, he did have a legit complaint since it never really got off the ground."
Earwolf,3al1ge,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:24:24 2015 UTC,"Is that the one with Matt Besser playing 'New Dad'? I thought he was really good, he went along with Besser's character and added to it by being the other Dad, added to the  'You don't get it Scott...' from Besser."
Earwolf,3al1ge,hamishwilson,10,Tue Jun 23 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"I had a friend who I had been working on for months and months to listen to CBB. She finally gave in and gave the show a try. Unfortunately, she listened to the very boring Marc Maron episode and will basically never listen again. I understand there were some extenuating circumstances, but that was also the first CBB I couldn't make it through.  Also just want to say, I don't know about you, but I'm definitely not completely unfunny."
Earwolf,3al1ge,pdxsean,6,Sun Jun 21 08:11:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a normal episode, and a horrible first ep, but I didn't hate it.  They did their best, and Marc played along with the games well, if I remember correctly."
Earwolf,3al1ge,siriusthinking,8,Sun Jun 21 16:08:45 2015 UTC,Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite) was pretty awful. Been awhile since I listened to the EP so not sure if not getting it was the issue or if Heder is just painfully unfunny. He and Harris went about 50 rounds into a game of What Am I Thinking.
Earwolf,3al1ge,Bell_Biv_daBob,19,Sun Jun 21 10:48:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the hate for that episode. It wasn't the best ever, but it was totally enjoyable. Jon Heder played along well, he just wasn't the usual improvisor/cbb-head we're accustomed too."
Earwolf,3al1ge,Jsm00v3,4,Sun Jun 21 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a pretty terrible game of What Am I Thinking? but you can't judge an episode on that. Plus I'll usually give someone a pass if they're not necessarily funny, but are willing to play along with all the bits. The only truly  bad guests are the ones who don't do that."
Earwolf,3al1ge,ericfishlegs,2,Sun Jun 21 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even say it was a bad episode, it did have Scott and Harris, and it isn't that Heder wasn't game. I just remember it being pretty awkward at a few points."
Earwolf,3al1ge,Bell_Biv_daBob,2,Sun Jun 21 17:04:01 2015 UTC,Harris seemed really annoyed with him
Earwolf,3al1ge,awesomeman462,7,Mon Jun 22 05:50:42 2015 UTC,"David Allan Grier was just annoying on CBB, which sucks because I still keep it on my ipod for Lauren Lapkus's character during the second part.  I think it's most people that actually bug Scott on Twitter to let them be a guest. Jay Mohr, DAG, and I think maybe Tom Green did it. They were all pretty bad.   As for HH, I think only Pauly Shore didn't get it. But even if he did, he's basically anti-funny. I'm interested to know how he got booked on the show."
Earwolf,3al1ge,TheBlackSpank,2,Sun Jun 21 11:57:56 2015 UTC,"Podcasts have not been kind  to DAG. Turns out knowing more about him is terrible for his career.  (See CBB w/ DAG, Pete Holmes w/ Duncan Trussel, Pete Holmes w/ Nathasha Legerro, and many more I'm sure."
Earwolf,3al1ge,KyleCrusoe,3,Sun Jun 21 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"I used to love him on Loveline during the Carolla days, but I think he just lost it over time."
Earwolf,3al1ge,TheBlackSpank,2,Sun Jun 21 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"That takes me back. I would always get so excited when he was the guest for the night. It was guaranteed laughs. Of course I was like 15, so who knows if I'd still think it was funny."
Earwolf,3al1ge,sleepsholymountain,3,Sun Jun 21 21:31:20 2015 UTC,I listen to the old episodes from time to time. Downloaded them all somewhere a while back. They're not hard to find.  And he's still great in them. Such high energy to counteract Adam and Drew's low energy approach. Everyone just had fun every night he was in.
Earwolf,3al1ge,TheBlackSpank,4,Sun Jun 21 21:36:03 2015 UTC,"I think I know the bottom Hollywood Handbook eps via the relisten we're doing over in /r/HollywoodHandbook . We're 32 episodes in, so there could be some stinkers in that more recent ones. But the DC Pierson solo ep is very dry, although he brings the heat in the live episode. And it's not a good bet to say he doesn't get it as he does improv with Sean lots. It just didn't come together.  But I cannot imagine a worse episode of HH than Nick Thune. Pauly Shore didn't get it, sure, but that episode is a dang classic. If there are sliding scales of ""getting it"" and ""energy"" at least Pauly had high values on the latter. The boys even remark on how bad the Thune ep is in the Thomas Middleditch episode."
Earwolf,3al1ge,nohorseman,9,Sun Jun 21 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like Hollywood Handbook eps are never truly awful because even when the guest is bad, the pre-guest segments are always fairly solid. Like the Nick Thune ep's pre-guest segment was ""Just OSC Her"" which while not a classic, is still pretty great. This is different to something like CBB, where one bad guest can derail the entire podcast."
Earwolf,3al1ge,Catvoca,4,Sun Jun 21 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the Thune ep, but I remember laughing my whole butt off listening to the DC Pierson ep. You should try to give it another listen. It started off pretty dry and slow but there were some all time great HH moments on that ep."
Earwolf,3al1ge,MeanLatifah,3,Sun Jun 21 18:26:36 2015 UTC,I'm on my first HH listen-through and I just got through the Thune episode last Friday. Glad I'm not alone in thinking it was pretty weak. Especially in contrast to the preceding episode with Dave Holmes which I thought was fucking hilarious even though Holmes isn't really a comedian.
Earwolf,3al1ge,sleepsholymountain,3,Sun Jun 21 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"Surprised no one's mentioned Bill Callahan from CBB 258 yet. I mean, yeah, he was just a muuuuuusical guest, but St. Vincent and Aimee Mann have done well in that spot. Bill was one of the worst interviews I've ever heard, not just on Earwolf or on a podcast but anywhere. He basically answered every question with ""yes"" or ""no"", followed by silence."
Earwolf,3al1ge,TwoTacoTuesdays,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"I came to post the same thing. I love Callahan, one of my all time favorites, but it came across like he was on the show as a favor to a publicist friend or something and he really didn't want to be there at all."
Earwolf,3al1ge,arsene14,-1,Sun Jun 21 21:25:54 2015 UTC,"The episode with American Football was kind of crappy at many parts, they just weren't comedians. It could've been much worse if Scott wasn't a fantastic and experienced host. The worst parts were just the acoustic versions of their emo songs, which in a way is kind of funny in the context of these three guys who made an album a decade ago and haven't worked together since and won't again."
Earwolf,3al1ge,Khanstant,4,Sun Jun 21 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, that was a bonus episode and like you said, they're not comedians. They seemed to be having a good time and I don't think it ever got awkward or anything."

Earwolf,3al1ge,steampunkjesus,-2,Tue Jun 23 15:33:18 2015 UTC,It was definitely the ego coddling Scott and Reggie did to Dane Cook. That guy is a horrible misogynistic comedian and the antithesis of what I seek out in comedy and for CBB to bend over backwards for him made me lose respect for them.
Earwolf,3al1ge,Ryan_Alan,7,Sun Jun 21 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with the ego-coddling issues. The latter opinion I disagree with.  Dane, while he may not be my brand of comedy, has been a huge contributor to the comedy community and to charity.

Don't disrespect the people that gave you a chance. Don’t do an hour of mean-spirited trash. And Dane Cook, certainly don't ask anyone to feel sorry for you. If you are the person you were onstage last night then you are not a good person. And the way you talk about women is disgusting and pathetic, but really just hurtful. So Good Luck Chuck.

I thought she played along really well, I mean the whole part about getting Hayes computer working is an all time classic.   Edit: it's worth mentioning Grace really isn't a comedian, so I guess I wasn't really expecting her to be funny. She just works really well as the straight man to Sean and Hayes. Also, her astonished ""This is how you end it?"" to close out the ep is amazing"

I haven't listened to this one yet (pretty excited) but it's just something that gets kind of annoying after like the 40th time Chris brings up how people on the Internet can be douche bags.   I think Chris is a genuinely nice dude and I like him a lot so I'm really not trying to sound like an asshole here but all the internet troll talk is starting to get annoying.

Earwolf,3agqnf,chicknsandwich,6,Sat Jun 20 02:22:03 2015 UTC,"I think because he is more reliant on the Internet than most other comedians.  I remember he did a joke at the oscars or golden globes or something a couple years ago about trolls and explaining to them the proper use of their, they're, and there (which already had been beaten into the ground on reddit and other sites), and it hit me that he just kind of takes what's big on the Internet at the moment and rebrands it for tv, podcasting, etc to people who probably don't spend all day on reddit or other similar sites.  He probably talks about trolls a lot because he's constantly bombarded by them as he's combing different social media sites for the latest web lingo.  I don't know, maybe none of that is true.  He seems like a nice guy and good host."
Earwolf,3agqnf,StrayNippleHair,2,Sat Jun 20 07:01:08 2015 UTC,"I remember that! It was painful. I've slowly been listening to old CDRs and his early guest hosting gigs featured heavy usage of the word 'gay' as a derogatory remark.

Earwolf,3agqnf,nohorseman,4,Sat Jun 20 15:54:20 2015 UTC,I really don't know! The worst part is that when he brings it up he always says the best thing to do is to ignore it...but he always talks about it!

All celebrities get people talking shit to them for no reason, but I think it's hard for Chris to completely disengage and ignore them; I've heard him tell stories about how he'll get into an Internet fight just to realize he isn't doing anything but making himself look bad.   This is longer than I intended, and maybe I give him too much credit, but I think joking about them is just his way of dealing with them.   Edit: also, he did some genuinely garbage stuff in the 90s (singled out, cmon) so he probably gets a lot of shit for that."

Earwolf,3agqnf,gerradp,2,Sat Jun 20 06:10:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm sure he's a nice enough guy. Just not a fan of his act at all."
Earwolf,3agqnf,PunkMoon,4,Sat Jun 20 14:04:14 2015 UTC,"Is that a real quote?  JFC.  I give him credit for recognizing his audience and stroking their egos juuuuust right, but he just goes too far with the nerd schtick.  I mean, he hosted shows on MTV and KROQ, did shipmates, dates hot women, and has ""made it."" He might be a nerd, but it's not like the dude is getting stuffed in lockers."
Earwolf,3agqnf,DrDoofenshartz,10,Sat Jun 20 12:47:45 2015 UTC,Nerds is comic books and bullies is pumping our gas.
Earwolf,3agqnf,credibit,3,Sat Jun 20 13:50:33 2015 UTC,"Yep. From his ""Mandroid"" special. In which he also rails against ""hipster nerds""."
Earwolf,3agqnf,PunkMoon,3,Sat Jun 20 14:02:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that he's the worst. I hate nerds and nerd culture. I like comedy but don't like the nerd subset of what is mostly white alt comedy. However I have listened to the nerdist pod for interviews and have found it to be somewhat tolerable. The absolute wost though, is when you tune in to a podcast and immediately can tell from cadence, intonation, and the way people are talking that they are self- declared nerds. Like the wolfpop show the Canon, I can't really handle their speech patterns."
Earwolf,3agqnf,potatohead3,4,Sat Jun 20 14:40:38 2015 UTC,"I think Chris is an awesome person and am happy with the success that he's been achieving, but he does get on my nerves with his interviews.  Most of his questions are totally predictable softballs (""Hey Morgan Freeman, what got you into acting?"").  He winds up sounding so ass-kissy with his guests.  This is exasperated whenever he's joined by his minions.  It usually turns into an unspoken contest of who can make their guest laugh the most.  It was most unbearable for me during the Kathryn Hahn interview.  And now there's this new guy Kyle or whatever whose job is to laugh his balls off at every other sentence that Chris says.  It becomes unlistenable.   It's a shame because he pulls outstanding guests, and I know Chris is capable of much more. He's a smart funny dude.  Maron is the king of the interview."
Earwolf,3agqnf,ArthurDigbyS,7,Sat Jun 20 04:06:05 2015 UTC,How do you juggle work and family?
Earwolf,3agqnf,michaelstripe,4,Sat Jun 20 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about that Kyle guy, like what is he? Is he a co host? An engineer? Or just a dude who laughs like crazy in the background?   He seems nice in the pre show stuff but I just don't get his purpose."
Earwolf,3agqnf,Pierce2089,2,Sat Jun 20 05:00:09 2015 UTC,Kyle does the show notes. He takes notes during the interview and types up a synopsis for the website.
Earwolf,3agqnf,cdcformatc,5,Tue Jun 23 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"Jesus, the forced laughter from Matt and Jonah you hear in the background is insufferable.  I really like a lot of Nerdist interviews but they suck up to Hardwick so...hard? The Nathan Fielder one is also hard to listen to, no one had any idea who they were talking to."
Earwolf,3agqnf,mrbananagrabber1,7,Sat Jun 20 05:03:52 2015 UTC,Dude there is no way Jonah is the guy with forced laughter in the background. Matt maybe but definitely not Jonah. Jonah kept it straight during the one of the funniest moments on the podcast when Nick Offerman said the most ridiculous joke and everyone was dying besides Jonah. He knows how to keep it together.   I think it's that Kyle guy...
Earwolf,3agqnf,Pierce2089,2,Sat Jun 20 05:22:50 2015 UTC,"Matt's laughter may not be forced, but it definitely sounds like it is. And most of it comes after one of his own jokes."
Earwolf,3agqnf,ArthurDigbyS,9,Sat Jun 20 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"Listened to this! It was excellent!   People complaining about Chris Hardwick being a zero absolutely need to listen to this. He gets some magical comeuppance. Our golden girl is completely wonderful as you'd hope and expect. Jonah has a good rapport with Lauren and kind of takes it over, and does great.   It has the kind of details I was hoping to get out of the AMA and didn't. I have seen Jurassic World and I was desperate for the convo they had.   Essential listening for any Lapkus Lad or Lass"

Earwolf,3agqnf,theloniousfunkd,10,Sat Jun 20 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind I haven't listened yet. But try to keep in mind Lauren is an aspiring actress and comedian in general. I'm sure she loves her podcast and appreciates it but when doing an interview like this you have to plug and talk about your money making activity.   I haven't listened so I should shut up, but there's more to Lauren Lapkus than earwolf and her podcast is all I'm trying to say."

Earwolf,3agqnf,nicemaker,8,Sat Jun 20 02:29:03 2015 UTC,I'm not mad or anything I was just explaining why she may have not talked about her podcast. No problems here.

Earwolf,3ag2z1,TakeItToTheMax,6,Sat Jun 20 02:46:24 2015 UTC,Closest thing to that would be my comment and I'm definitely a fan of his podcast. I just think it's funny how he will shoehorn his own issues into unrelated discussions.
Earwolf,3ag2z1,Rimm,8,Sat Jun 20 02:49:38 2015 UTC,Opening up about one's own issues is a great way to get others to open up about theirs.

Earwolf,3ag2z1,ksaid1,2,Sat Jun 20 07:03:00 2015 UTC,"I find most of his non-comedy guest interviews (and there have been very few comedians lately) pretty dull. And some of his comedian interviews, too. Maron's brand of whatlifeisallaboutmaaaan had a limit for me, and it might have been reached in the RuPaul episode (which may not have been the worst one, but was the one I went back to after I'd gone to irregular listening, and couldn't stand Marc and RuPaul congratulating each other for ""getting it"" so hard).  That said, I listened to the Wanda Sykes episode recently, and really enjoyed it. I might have reached a limit a while ago and now maybe I could deal with the show better, or at least more selectively. I mean, I almost always skipped the preamble.  Meanwhile, the president did a show whose title (and theme song) has the word ""fuck"" in it."
Earwolf,3ag2z1,goofy_ball,2,Sun Jun 21 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"For me, I think he is kind of a comedy snob, has an inflated ego imo, and he was a total dick to Kumail on Doug Loves Movies."

Earwolf,3ag2z1,coldbitterness,2,Mon Jun 22 16:35:11 2015 UTC,"I mean, the first 150 episodes of his podcast were basically him passive-agressively working out past feuds with guests.    Maron definitely is kind of a dick, doesn't mean he can't make a compelling podcast at the same time."

Anyway to calmly answer your question without hating you... It is an ifc show and a pure sketch show. Those are harder to get recognized nowadays with such mainstream shows like key and peele   It's a great show, great sketches, and I loved it, but much like podcasts in general it was stupidly underrated. It's a shame but it's how the biz happens sometimes"
Earwolf,3ah132,Slayner,4,Sat Jun 20 02:58:30 2015 UTC,The silver lining to every show you like getting killed early is that you never have to watch it decline. Your memories get to be about a great show dearly missed.

Earwolf,3adrdg,DanzigMeowMeow,10,Fri Jun 19 16:13:29 2015 UTC,It's tough to ruin any podcast when Gourley and PFT are on together.
Earwolf,3adrdg,TomLeykis101,3,Fri Jun 19 13:02:11 2015 UTC,Ugh. I read your post wrong. I kept listening to Chick Chat thinking those two were gonna show up.
Earwolf,3adrdg,peon_taking_credit,4,Sat Jun 20 04:37:34 2015 UTC,"While that is true I'll give credit where credit is due and say she was also very funny, even before Gurley showed up, and she yes anded much better."
Earwolf,3adrdg,Slayner,2,Fri Jun 19 13:08:50 2015 UTC,Listen to the James Bonding episode Golderfinger if you want to hear Gourley in a carcrash episode. Even if you agree with the points being made its an uncomfortable listen
Earwolf,3adrdg,Lukepatrick88,6,Sun Jun 21 11:04:18 2015 UTC,"I hate to jump on the Cameron-hating bandwagon, but I just don't like her comedy. There are good CBB episodes with her on them, but not because of her. She was okay in the JW Stillwater episodes, but it's kind of a slam dunk whenever anyone is on with PFT. He's the safest second guest a first guest could have. He can carry the whole show."
Earwolf,3adrdg,TheBlackSpank,8,Sun Jun 21 12:13:36 2015 UTC,"I also really enjoyed Esposito on her two CBB appearances with JW (same as you, I thought she was hilarious before JW even came on), my issue here is that it is clearly satire towards... something, but it is so muddled it almost comes off as playing it straight. I think I'm missing something?  She could be confronting her critics because the whole thing is very ""Esposito-y"" but I'm not really certain that it is. So mainly I'm just confused."
Earwolf,3adrdg,requisite_monocle,16,Fri Jun 19 13:28:22 2015 UTC,I'm pretty terrified to ever criticize Cameron Esposito.
Earwolf,3adrdg,jarluch,9,Fri Jun 19 13:27:30 2015 UTC,Is she really that popular? It seems like a Lena Dunham thing. Where her peers turn out to be her biggest fans.
Earwolf,3adrdg,Prax150,3,Fri Jun 19 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"The AVClub really likes her, but I think that's a little to your point. Have you heard Same Sex Symbol? (I haven't)"
Earwolf,3adrdg,nohorseman,2,Fri Jun 19 17:28:24 2015 UTC,I first heard of her when she opened for Hannibal Burress maybe 3 years ago and I was really impressed with her stand up.  Shes definitely a better stand up than a podcast guest.
Earwolf,3adrdg,Rimm,13,Sat Jun 20 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"I try to defend her when people say she brings up her sexuality too much, that's the pits. But everything in this thread seems very fair"
Earwolf,3adrdg,nohorseman,8,Fri Jun 19 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"I just don't want to hear someone constantly talking about how much they love to slaytang, you know?"
Earwolf,3adrdg,ReliableSource,4,Fri Jun 19 16:04:49 2015 UTC,No Talking 'Tang?
Earwolf,3adrdg,ItsScriabinAwhile,10,Fri Jun 19 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"The first CBB episode I think she absolutely brought up her sexuality too much, I'm not sure if she just mistook the show's format for more of an interview show or what but it was kinda jarring. (Not that I care what her preferences are, just didn't need to constantly be brought up)   The second CBB episode I had zero problems with her whatsoever.   And even though it was kinda a feminist epiosde here, that's fine because that's what the whole 'bit' was. It was just making fun of feminism if anything, it just felt dry and fell short.   Idk. I think espositio can be funny in the right situation, but this wasn't one of those situations to me."
Earwolf,3adrdg,Slayner,6,Fri Jun 19 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"That's p fair. It does seem out of place on occasion. But I wonder if we notice it more because it's an alternative lifestyle? Male comedians bring up their dicks and heterosexual relationships constantly too.   She does really like to establish her identity though. And doesn't really have it down to a couple of hilarious bit paths like Tig does (although Tig is more famous / established). And Stephanie Allyne doesn't bring it up much but she has a different style of podcast appearance, as I mostly hear her in improv scenes yaknow"
Earwolf,3adrdg,nohorseman,5,Fri Jun 19 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean that's a fair point too, but I mean I just generally agree that if it doesn't lead somewhere why mention it or bring it up. When I binge listened to PB I had a hunch Tig was gay but didn't actually know until like 50 episodes in (probably exaggerating but it was a long time)   Never knew Stephanie Allyne was gay until the whole Tig thing, and didn't know Adomian was gay until a standup set I saw online.   Not to say striaght people should use it as a crux either, but you're right maybe I just don't notice it.   Either way, if it doesn't lead to some great bits why bring it up is my  thought process.   It's all good though, I don't hate her for it, just that first episode was pretty noticeable to me."
Earwolf,3adrdg,Slayner,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"Jumping in here - I was SURPRISED when I realized Adomian was gay, because it never comes out in his characters on CBB. But I don't really remember him being on the show as himself after it switched from CDR to CBB.  I knew about Tig before PB, but it was hilarious that she always referred to ""the mammal"" she was dating. And I somehow realized Steph was her girlfriend, but hadn't heard of her before the movie they did together.  I think I agree with /u/nohorseman that it's different, so we notice it more because it's not what we're used to hearing? On PB, they used to discuss all of their dating experiences, and it was normalized. On CBB, it might seem out of place in Cameron's case, but we just heard a little about Jason's dating life this week - and it wasn't jarring?"
Earwolf,3adrdg,jmg089,6,Fri Jun 19 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"Adomian definitely has tons of homosexuality come out in his characters.   The Sheriff of Nottingham is a whole character based on the villainization of homosexuality by society/the media   Tom Leykis is aggressively homophobic and hasn't updated his view on gay men since the 80s  George Zimmer the Men's Wearhouse guy sucked a lot of dicks and I don't quite know what point Adomian was making but it was really funny   Dov Charney was more about gender, but a vicious skewering of the predatory straight male   So it's there and I guess it's a little more subtle although after typing this all I can hear is Adomian's signature shouting sucking blowjob noises  Also this stuff is all funny and has something to say, which you could argue Cameron often doesn't necessarily, other than providing context and perspective to stories / observations  And then there's Jesse Ventura / Bernie Sanders / that philosopher guy / Huell Howser where it at most  might come up some but doesn't feature prominently. Although Cameron as JW's ward didn't either   Edit: this is all very complicated and I have mixed feelings"
Earwolf,3adrdg,nohorseman,2,Fri Jun 19 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"Haha. Ok so I haven't heard Sheriff of Nottingham or Dov Charney. Whoops. You're right, after looking at the other characters he does, he comments on it, but I agree that it is more subtle. And my prominent Adomian characters are Huell Howser/Jesse Venture/Tom Leykis, so maybe I just need to focus more when listening.  And I agree about Cameron adding it in as perspective, but maybe people think her comedy should stand-alone? It doesn't bother me, and usually fleshes out her stories for me."
Earwolf,3adrdg,jmg089,3,Fri Jun 19 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"Dov Charney is a fucking delight. You should absolutely listen to Canadian Apparel from last year I adore that episode. Maybe one of my favorite things Adomian has ever done and I'm a real Huell-head.   I had that argument chambered cause I try to defend / at least soften the argument against Cameron Esposito. Which is complicated because she's probably not even top 30 favorite comedians of mine I just feel she gets unnecessarily criticized in this way.  I didn't mean to blow you up haha, this thread and what you said is very calm and reasonable   Plus her episode of JV Club is amazing."
Earwolf,3adrdg,nohorseman,2,Fri Jun 19 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"I remember an ep with discussion about some kind of date contest winners possibly being women, and maybe they'd want a date with Scott instead of whatever woman it was. Scott said he was married, so too bad, and then someone suggested Adomian; Scott said ""Again, barking up the wrong tree"" and I was like hmmmmmm..."

Not saying Esposito is a bad person just don't enjoy listening to her podcast appearances too much"
Earwolf,3adrdg,Slayner,7,Fri Jun 19 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"My philosophy tends to be that if I see a big gang up of criticism I agree with, I don't feel the need to add to it unless a specific thing wasn't mentioned. Then I'll bring it up while being political about it, as in as kind as I can. That's all assuming the target of criticism is generally just inoffensive.

I guess it's a good contrast for the ludicrous guests, but sometimes I can't even believe what a dweeb he is. I still love him, and I respect him like a MF for what he has put together.  I wish Mantzoukas had a podcast, honestly. Just from CBB I have started Hollywood Handbook, Special Guest: Lauren Lapkus, Improv 4 Humans, etc, but I always get fiendish for more.

Earwolf,3acf2i,oshoney,3,Fri Jun 19 15:29:04 2015 UTC,"From that description it definitely sounds like the type of show to only listen to interviews that interest me, not necessarily all of them."
Earwolf,3acf2i,branmuffinzed,2,Fri Jun 19 00:19:43 2015 UTC,That should be the case with all straight up interview podcasts - including if you go with Totally Laime or By the Way.
Earwolf,3acf2i,branmuffinzed,2,Fri Jun 19 00:24:40 2015 UTC,"Well my reasoning with Totally Laime or By The Way (or some others) is that sometimes the interviewers are good enough to where the interview with a person I don't know makes me check out their stuff and I become a fan of theirs when I went in not knowing anything.   I listen to select episodes of the nerdist for instance, but  idk some interview shows can be worth listening to all of them."
Earwolf,3acf2i,branmuffinzed,6,Fri Jun 19 00:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'd go Sklarbro, just because I think they're the most interesting personalities."
Earwolf,3acf2i,TheBlackSpank,2,Fri Jun 19 02:01:52 2015 UTC,Mind elaborating on what you like about the podcast? What's an average episode like? Or some high's and low's?
Earwolf,3acf2i,CakeBoss16,2,Fri Jun 19 02:05:36 2015 UTC,"Mostly, I just love the Sklar bros. They're interesting to listen to. Mainly they talk a bit about ""sports"" news, then bring a guest on and talk about some more ""sports"".  The reason I put sports in quotes is because it's very very loose. The news they cover is eclectic, they pick obscure, stupid sports, and i love it. They often go on tangents, but that's what I love."

Earwolf,3acf2i,CrouchJr,2,Fri Jun 19 00:14:02 2015 UTC,"Also if you like some hilarious impressions. Chris Cox, Dan Van Kirk, and James Adomian show up regularly as guests. Chris Cox has retired his Bruce Jenner impression since he became Caitlyn Jenner, but if you're binge-listening earlier episodes, you'll get to hear a lot of him and it's hilarious."
Earwolf,3acf2i,CrouchJr,6,Fri Jun 19 00:25:14 2015 UTC,Jeff garlin get some great guests. You'll have a big bowl of fun listening to it. Also the episode are short and fun too listen too. Jeff is average at interviewing thou.
Earwolf,3acf2i,sombredolores,3,Fri Jun 19 01:19:51 2015 UTC,"I think I may knock that one out then, maybe with Rafflecast, since they're both short I can do those in-between whatever next big one I choose."
Earwolf,3acf2i,Michael__Pemulis,5,Sun Jun 21 19:18:46 2015 UTC,I would suggest not listening to too many back to back. Jeff way overuses his favorite phrases and just can generally get really annoying pretty quick. And I generally like the guy.

It's too long, I don't like the cohost the gambling or guessing games with music annoys me and it's very dry most of the time for me.   This is after listening to all of the first two earwolf seasons so after getting that far I completely gave up on it."
Earwolf,3acf2i,nohorseman,3,Fri Jun 19 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"I see, it's not for everyone and you gave it a good chance. The NNF fans are out to get you though aha"

It just isn't my thing.   Much like I know HH can drive some people insane."
Earwolf,3acf2i,nohorseman,4,Fri Jun 19 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"Sklarbro. Definitely. I would personally suggest starting with the 'county' episodes - they started I think a year into the regular podcast and  are separately numbered. Every week, they do one episode of Country, which is basically all sports, and one episode of County, which is more straight comedy. Dan van Kirk comes in with three insane news stories, and the Sklars bring in a guest every episode to round out to four people. It's mostly a riff fest with tons of great characters. Adomian comes in sometimes, unsurprisingly Mark Wahlberg makes the occasional appearance, and van Kirk sometimes does this Chicago sportscaster Doug Buffone, and it's amazing."
Earwolf,3acf2i,arcadium83,2,Fri Jun 19 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds great! If I listen I'll start at the beginning, but that makes me pretty happy that you have such high acclaim for it."
Earwolf,3acf2i,crunchycrispy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:32:02 2015 UTC,"I know that you're a completist type, but I would also suggest County as the point of emphasis for the Skalrs. I loved the Sklars as a kid because I like sports and actually grew up in basically the same area of the same city as them, but over time I have come to see them as largely 'hit or miss'. Country is entirely dependent on the guest for it to be enjoyable (although they get some great guests and many different guests than most Earwolf shows), but County is pretty much always going to be good. A lot of it has to do with Dan Van Kirk. He is probably one of the most under-appreciated people in the whole comedy world right now (I'm just waiting for him to blow up).  So while the Country episodes with Jon Hamm are absolute classics, the average County episode is far better than the average Country episode. Seriously County is one of the most consistently enjoyable comedy podcasts out there. I would suggest the episode with the dashing Matt Gourley as the best (it includes an utterly epic story that personally happened to DVK) County installment.   Just something to take into consideration. (I'm more or less suggesting you listen to the Country episodes with guests you know/like and all of the County episodes.)"
Earwolf,3acf2i,TomLeykis101,5,Fri Jun 19 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"Rafflecast. The format is constantly changing and there aren't that many episodes, so it'll probably be difficult to get bored of it. Jon Daly is consistently funny and Cyrus and Brett do a great job with the music."
Earwolf,3acf2i,Ricktron3030,3,Fri Jun 19 00:41:11 2015 UTC,What! Almost down with Whooch already? Slayner you're an unstoppable machine.

It's been 5 months since I started, and I got about 2-3 more weeks so basically 6 months of whooch.   I feel like I could have got done with it sooner actually, but I got a bit burnt out midway through before catching my second wind.   I've really, really loved the show but it is a monster to binge through"
Earwolf,3acf2i,Druidpryde,2,Fri Jun 19 14:39:46 2015 UTC,"Sklarbro is good and I love the Sklars but my opinion is that the quality of the episode really depends on the guest. For me, it is not one that I listen to every week.  I recently went through Totally Laime and really loved it because the hosts are great and different from a lot of the typical Earwolf crew. Also the guests tend to be different as well.  One that you did not mention, so I'm not sure whether you have listened or not, is Never Not Funny. I love Jimmy Pardo and his co-host Matt. He also gets a wide variety of guests both from the Earwolf/UCB community and random funny people that I have not heard before. The back catalog is limited to this season so there is not quite as many episodes to listen to."

And since Marc is the ultimate anti-sellout, fuck pandering kind of dude, he has a lot of pressure to stick to that.

Earwolf,3a9hhe,Effective_Aggression,4,Thu Jun 18 14:00:37 2015 UTC,"I4H has always seemed to have my advertisers than shows like HH (even though this may not be the case now). Squarespace and NatureBox pretty regularly have ads on I4H and I feel like those are two pretty big ones for Earwolf.  I think they are just trying to attract even more advertisers? HH has the same survey, even though they are pretty consistently getting ads from Loot Crate.   I'm not too concerned about I4H or Matty B. A weekly improv show from one of the creators from UCB is probably going to be ok (on top of this, I think Besser really enjoys doing I4H, on that weird Q&A thing he released a few weeks ago, he talked about how he like that the suggestions for scenes from I4H were pretty different from most Improv shows)"
Earwolf,3a9hhe,requisite_monocle,3,Thu Jun 18 14:47:54 2015 UTC,"Right the point of the survey is to get the demographic and income information of earwolf listeners, very standard they've done it a couple times since I've been listening to earwolf shows.

I'm not worried about his show, but I also don't think it gets the respect it rightfully deserves due to Besser's credentials."

So you know, it's kind of been on the ropes since the very beginning, and I think it's part of the Tig/Dave/Kyle style. They take things pretty loose and fancy-free, whether it's their ""guests"" or their dedication to topics or keeping schedule. Which of course is their prerogative, it's their show.  I would be happy if it continued but I'd also be happy if it faded away, if that meant that Kyle would be able to either start his own podcast or find some other way to be more famous. I pretty much only listen for Kyle anymore, I wish Tig and David well but honestly Kyle is the only one I find consistently hilarious."

Earwolf,3a60v0,argentuned,3,Thu Jun 18 01:22:32 2015 UTC,"I think this is the best clue. I'd say in this recording he sounds, at oldest, 13 years old, which would make him 48 right now."

Earwolf,3a5nn6,earwoof,7,Wed Jun 17 12:38:57 2015 UTC,"A loss is a loss, really.  It depends on how big a part of your life he was, but no one really has the right to judge your reaction to it.  It's not like you're turning it into something that's about you, so feel however you feel.  I was fairly new to Harris's stuff at the point where he died, but have immensely enjoyed what he did and just his style, especially on podcasts.  But he wasn't a big enough part of my regular life outside of those for it to have a full impact.  However, there are a number of youtubers for example that I do follow and enjoy on a daily basis, to the point where I'll even have some of them playing in the background while at work much like I would a podcast.  It's a comfort thing or whatever.  If any of them were to die then it would be very sad for me as it would leave a gap that they specifically filled in my daily life that I know couldn't be replaced (unlike a tv or film character who we know is temporary or can be bought back or rebooted or whatever).  So there is a sense of loss because they bought something to us and now it's no longer there.  I know this doesn't answer your point directly, but I don't think you should feel bad or weird about feeling sad.  If anything it could just reflect how much they did mean to you.  Whether you knew them or not. (apologies for the slightly disjointed response, currently at work and flicking between windows/thoughts)"
Earwolf,3a5nn6,stolen_art,7,Wed Jun 17 13:37:31 2015 UTC,The short answer? Yes.
Earwolf,3a5nn6,ostrichheaven,6,Wed Jun 17 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"I have a similar story that may be relevant, if you don't mind me sharing it. Around six years ago I discovered a video game news website called Giantbomb.com, and immediately fell in love with their irreverent style and willingness to not take themselves too seriously, especially on their podcast The Giant Bombcast. In an industry where the consumer is all too willing to be spoon fed the generic marketing line by other websites, these guys felt like punk rock writers who weren't afraid to speak their minds, and since each week they recorded new videos and an episode of the podcast (which regularly ran upwards of 2 1/2 hours), I listened to them a lot.   Chief among those personalities was podcast host Ryan Davis, a man who could only be described as magnanimous. He was quick to insult you, but at the same time would be the guy laughing hardest at your shitty joke. He was king of the Summer Jams, and probably the only person to every be quoted in the New Yorker about stabbing people in the face and neck. Personally, he was a huge inspiration for me, as he showed me that with hard work and a lot of passion you can build one of the most respected outlets in the industry out of nothing.   In 2013, only a couple days after his wedding, Ryan passed away. It devastated everyone who knew of him. Much like Harris the love and support from all corners of his sphere of influence came immediately (that last one is a doozy). And much like Harris, the common refrain was ""He wouldn't want us moping about it"". And it's true for both of them.    I'm sharing this story because when Harris passed earlier this year it brought up a lot of the feelings I thought I had come to terms with when Ryan passed. I guess it was the metaphorical straw that broke the camel's back. Harris and Ryan didn't just make podcasts, they provided inspiration, laughter - we had listened to them so much that they felt like old friends, even family. No matter how stupid you feel about it, the fact remains that Harris left a hole that can never be filled.   So yes, I guess I am still really upset. But in the end, it all comes back to that refrain - instead of mourning Harris' death, celebrate his life, and what he meant to you. And take comfort in knowing that there are people who feel the exact same way."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,the_three_stans,6,Wed Jun 17 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"One of my friends was a Ryan Davis fan, and he mentioned his passing to me when Harris first left us. My friend said he still can't listen to backlogged episodes too close to Ryan's passing. It's a very similar situation.    I love how you said, instead of mourning Harris' death, celebrate his life, and what he meant to you. I am truly so happy that his work is so accessible because he's still making people laugh and bringing joy to other people. A short loving life where you spend your time making others happy isn't bad. Harris kind of reminds me why I love comedy and looking back I have such a deep love and respect for him and his work. Thank you."

Earwolf,3a5nn6,Pluppets,6,Wed Jun 17 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"You have every right to mourn his passing, the same way that people mourned the deaths of Michael Jackson or Robin Williams. Just because he didnt know you doesnt mean you didnt know him. Somebody that makes you laugh, smile, and inspires you has left us. I cant think of a more perfect reaction than one of grief. So you should get all notions of feeling silly over this out of your head. That might help you move into acceptence.   I wish you the best man."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,IngmarBergmanAMA,3,Wed Jun 17 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"I keep falling into a cycle where I think about his contributions and his death by watching, listening, and reading stuff by him and about him. It's weird... happens about once a month or so. I haven't really thought about Robin Williams' death since it happened, but something keeps bringing me back to Harris."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,Peel_Here,6,Wed Jun 17 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"I feel similarly, and being a huge Robin Williams fan it  made me wonder why his death didn't affect me as much as Harris'. I think I feel as though we got a full career out of Williams. He fulfilled. His potential was realized.   Harris was just fuckin starting and everything pointed to him having a long, illustrious career in comedy. We never got to see what he would have accomplished. We can go back and listen to foam or his nonsensical characters, watch the episodes he wrote for parks or eastbound, but there was so, so, so much more I wanted to hear from him.   Both were extremely unique figures and both extremely influential on my sense of humor, but for some reason I can't even listen to any of his appearances without a heavy heart while I can watch Mrs. Doubtfire without modicum of sadness."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,woahthereareladies,3,Thu Jun 18 01:12:14 2015 UTC,"I was feeling this exact way last week pretty strongly for some reason, I tried to bring it up with a couple friends and they all sort of brushed it off like it was a little weird. It's really heartbreaking, he's a very relatable person. There's these huge comedians like Louis CK that you can't imagine yourself in their shoes, but Harris was relatable and his success seemed sort of attainable in a way. It's also really heartbreaking that he was on the verge of some great things. Moving to NY with Aziz, working on new projects. Plus he was so brutally honest about his addiction in a way that made you feel like, someone this honest about it can't be in that much trouble with it, right? Heroin addicts who die don't also go on podcast and joke about it, right?"
Earwolf,3a5nn6,hrmfll,3,Wed Jun 17 21:39:38 2015 UTC,"You're not alone in this feeling.  It feels weird not to have have 'heard from him' in so long, and then I suddenly remember why and I get sad."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,thedrew,3,Thu Jun 18 03:48:08 2015 UTC,"Podcasts have an oddly personal component to them. They are audio, they are on demand, and they tend to listen to them on their own.   His TV and stand up seem like a first glimpse at a blossoming career, but the hours of podcast appearances seem more like having a friend-of-a-friend hang out in your living room.   You know more about his life, the good and the bad, than you do of most untimely celebrity deaths, so you can more clearly see the tragedy in it.   I wouldn't say I'm ""still really upset."" I saw this as a possibility in Analyze Phish. But I still think about him and the circumstance of his death more than I would expect. I think in part because my mind is still ""hanging out"" with his friends by listening to earwolf podcasts."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,BentleyCarr,2,Thu Jun 18 10:37:12 2015 UTC,"I have a couple thoughts on this.  Try not to focus on whether or not this is ""healthy"", since doing so is only going to  trip you up as you grieve over it.  Plus, what is ""Healthy"" is super subjective anyway.  I do think that with any kind of loss you tend to judge yourself for having feelings about it at all, so I really don't think it's uncommon.  I grew up with my father and his friends being super Deadheads, and when Jerry died there was a lot of genuine sorrow.  So just an example to help you realize that this type of grief isn't totally uncommon.  I'm pretty sure the people who leave things at Jim Morrison's grave aren't all close friends and associates.  The other way to look at it is it might be triggering feelings from other losses you've had in your life.  But really, do your best not to judge yourself, it's totally common & understandable to feel sad.  I think it's cool you posted here to find others to may feel similarly, that seems like a good step to get out of the isolation feeling.  It's a very, very sad thing that happened.  My mom noticed I ""liked"" his sister's article on facebook and read it herself, it had her in tears and she didn't even know who he was."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,8eat-mesa,3,Wed Jun 17 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"You're probably right about it triggering feelings from other losses. I lost my cousin this past November because of heroin, but I didn't even really react because we weren't on good terms with each other. Maybe that's where some of this guilt is coming from. Thank you for being understanding."
Earwolf,3a5nn6,TheAmazingApathyMan,2,Wed Jun 17 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"Scott's eulogy is really sad but great to listen to to remember Harris by.  I agree, it's just like Robin Williams and Christopher Lee. We never met them, but their death affects us.  And Harris' affects more because Podcast's are fairly personal. And because he was an amazing person."

Earwolf,3a1ym1,Cantkillabullmoose,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:27:31 2015 UTC,That's one I've never heard before. I recently watched the first five seasons of Parks with her and she fucking LOVED it. There were a few sex jokes that got a little awkward but overall it's now one of her favorite shows. She'll be excited to know that Jean Ralphio is actually retarded. Lol
Earwolf,3a1ym1,branmuffinzed,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:01:02 2015 UTC,"Perhaps other people could contribute, but some of my favorite episodes (that I think are clean) are  Ben Schwartz as Roald Dahl, Andy Daly as L. Ron Hubbard (the Marquis de Sade episode is also good... But probably not appropriate), Matt Gourley as Ian Fleming, James Adomian as Walt Whitman, Scott Auckerman as Benjamin Franklin"

Earwolf,39y06i,nuxetcrux,6,Mon Jun 15 21:02:45 2015 UTC,"The one thing I really want to know is what she wants to accomplish in like 5-10 years. It seems like since the decline of SNL (or at least it's possible temporary dip in esteem), rising comedy stars are being made through more unconventional means versus letting SNL launch a career (I'm thinking primarily of Chelsea Peretti, Aziz, and I guess Louis CK, even though he has been around a bit. I think even Melissa McCarthy and Elle Kemper could be put into this group as well. And of course Scott and PFT).  From my perspective, it seems like Lauren is taking an even more less-traveled road. She is a hilarious improviser who got noticed from a small role in a hit show. Now, she has just appeared as the second leading female (which is kind of sad given how small the role actually is...) in the biggest global boxoffice hit ever.  Basically, I really want to know what her endgame is. Does she want to be a huge actor which seems like what people like Wiig and McCarthy are aiming for? Or is she more into the Poehler route of doing projects that you love?  Anyone can look at my comment or post history and see that I spend a lot of time on here talking about Lauren (and really all of Wild Horses). She is probably my favorite part of Earwolf and I suppose I am curious as to how she wants to turn this temporary starpower and recogbizibility into reaching her goals.  TL;DR: I'm terrible at getting questions in for AMAs so I am hoping one of you all will ask what Lauren hopes to accomplish in 5 years, or what types of projects she hopes to be in."
Earwolf,39y06i,requisite_monocle,6,Mon Jun 15 21:20:22 2015 UTC,Aziz starred on a network sit-com. That's a fairly conventional way of making it big.
Earwolf,39y06i,credibit,3,Mon Jun 15 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about his role on Scrubs? He very much mirrored Lapkus in that it was he was on a big show with a small role and was also a UCB darling at the time. He then got the stuff with Parks, Funny People, and his subesequent infamous comedy special."
Earwolf,39y06i,requisite_monocle,3,Mon Jun 15 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"Aziz became 'big' (as in, selling out theatres) after Parks and Rec."
Earwolf,39y06i,credibit,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:37:18 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure what point you are trying to make. Selling out Madison Square Garden is a certainly a momentous achievement but I feel Aziz has been genreally ranked in the upper echleon of stand-up comedians for quite awhile now (I was at Bonnaroo when he performed years ago and I had to wait in line for two-and-a-half hours to get passes to his show and their were a lot of people that left empty-handed).

Earwolf,39wfpz,irmavep,5,Mon Jun 15 22:32:59 2015 UTC,Prossably!
Earwolf,39wfpz,meandharpua,5,Mon Jun 15 21:44:59 2015 UTC,I must say that the idea of sentient trash keeps me up at night.
Earwolf,39wfpz,pumpkinoatmeal,4,Tue Jun 16 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"Heard last night that Andy Daly was going to be on Womp It Up today and thought 'welp, I guess I know what I'm listening to first tomorrow.' I was wrong."
Earwolf,39wfpz,catch_th3m_all,4,Mon Jun 15 11:48:13 2015 UTC,"""Slaying tang"" made me laugh while brushing my teeth."
Earwolf,39wfpz,Ailite,4,Mon Jun 15 18:10:52 2015 UTC,This one is amazing
Earwolf,39wfpz,TheAmazingApathyMan,3,Mon Jun 15 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"To me, Heynong Man sounds like a sounds like an archaeological relic of an early hominid discovered in a Malaysian cave. In my fantasy of a nat geo program about the Heynong Man they do facial reconstruction from his skeleton, and he looks remarkably like Zouks with a thicker brow."
Earwolf,39wfpz,HDMF,4,Tue Jun 16 22:26:00 2015 UTC,loved this ep.. made this pic for Talkin' 'Tang at the time. look at it.  http://imgur.com/gallery/VmOS8OQ/

Earwolf,39wfpz,adamav,6,Tue Jun 30 08:06:40 2015 UTC,"I heard it as, ""Hey, Nongman.""  Or am I missing something?"
Earwolf,39wfpz,sleepsholymountain,12,Mon Jun 15 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"Well they keep changing the way it's pronounced throughout the episode, but the reason it's written as ""heynong, man"" is because Jason was trying to say ""hang on, man"" and misspoke."
Earwolf,39wfpz,adamav,7,Mon Jun 15 17:23:25 2015 UTC,"I owe you and this thread an apology.  I posted my previous comment having only listened to the first 40 minutes, literally a few seconds before they started pronouncing it Heynong Man (like Slenderman.)  Lesson.  Learned."
Earwolf,39wfpz,BertSnerpis,3,Mon Jun 15 22:37:46 2015 UTC,PFTs got a good 'stache goin on
Earwolf,39wfpz,ajg1993,3,Mon Jun 15 15:07:50 2015 UTC,Can we pinpoint when all PFT characters started hating Scott? It seems to be as much a through line as international waters are for Andy Daly.
Earwolf,39wfpz,doubtinggull,2,Tue Jun 16 21:10:36 2015 UTC,Do they all? I thought Andrew Lloyd Webber has an almost paternal affection for young Scottrick.
Earwolf,39wfpz,ajg1993,2,Thu Jun 18 14:03:46 2015 UTC,"Ah you're right, good old ALW. Maybe my all-time favorite character, and certainly the one with the most grepisodes under his belt."
Earwolf,39wfpz,kazenzai,3,Thu Jun 18 16:44:15 2015 UTC,Just finished this episode. It could easily be a Top 5 episode.
Earwolf,39wfpz,samantha-mulder,3,Wed Jun 17 12:55:05 2015 UTC,"At least 33 women listen to podcasts, right?"
Earwolf,39wfpz,wikais,4,Thu Jun 18 03:50:18 2015 UTC,"Think Scott's ""what do you think of their logo?"" To PFT about Talkin' 'Tang was just trying to make them describe what the logo would be, but also referring to people complaining about Spontaneanation's logo?"
Earwolf,39zpm1,requisite_monocle,16,Tue Jun 16 02:27:48 2015 UTC,"Long before Guardians of the Galaxy, I've been wanting Chris Pratt to be on CBB."
Earwolf,39zpm1,ArthurDigbyS,12,Tue Jun 16 10:05:14 2015 UTC,"More SNL alums on The Hooray Show, who knows, maybe even Jimmy Fallon  Matt Gourley on With Special Guest, he's great at goofy characters."
Earwolf,39zpm1,nyan_swanson,8,Tue Jun 16 06:20:43 2015 UTC,Lately I've been shipping Christ Hardwick with Hollywood Handbook.  He's perfect for the bit.
Earwolf,39zpm1,KyleCrusoe,3,Tue Jun 16 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, for the convergence of bits!"
Earwolf,39zpm1,nicemaker,9,Tue Jun 16 21:19:32 2015 UTC,Kate McKinnon would be amazing on CBB.
Earwolf,39zpm1,siriusthinking,6,Tue Jun 16 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yeees, she was so good on the CBB TV show.  Kyle Mooney was also great on that ep."
Earwolf,39zpm1,SoberKeonClark,7,Tue Jun 16 13:41:50 2015 UTC,Sean and Hayes on How Did This Get Made
Earwolf,39zpm1,Slayner,8,Tue Jun 16 04:51:42 2015 UTC,"Seth Morris on any/every podcast. Including affirmation Nation. I'm so fucking sad if it ended again it was so great the second time around.   Also Matt Besser is stupidly underrated outside of his own I4H podcast.   Those two for sure.   Also I think Jessica St Clair is very funny in general and I'd like her to be on CBB or other podcasts, just do something other than Wompler."
Earwolf,39zpm1,Slayner,4,Tue Jun 16 02:30:18 2015 UTC,"In this vein, I think Armen needs to be on stuff more. Earwolf people (especially Sean and Hayes and Scott) feed off dead energy and I think he would definitely be interesting fits on both CBB and HH"
Earwolf,39zpm1,jetsetheadset,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"I have very strong opinions on armen... I have been going through the who charted backlog and I got to the month he Cohosted in place of Howard and I hated him.   Idk if it was just the Cohosting or him, but examples like the Scott episode with him and the Besser episode with him in whooch I know what you mean.   Idk how he would do on HH but to say the least it'd be interesting"
Earwolf,39zpm1,bullshque,3,Tue Jun 16 02:42:37 2015 UTC,Definitely my suggestion is more out of curioisity than actually insinuating that Armen would be a good fit. He is at his best when he is imploding and I think definitely Sean and Hayes (and maybe Scott) could do some funny shit with that
Earwolf,39zpm1,DanzigMeowMeow,5,Tue Jun 16 02:55:53 2015 UTC,I think Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett from SNL would be good guests for Bang Bang; the style of humor from their Good Neighbor sketches is similar to the comedy of the CBBuniverse
Earwolf,39zpm1,sm33,6,Tue Jun 16 02:53:46 2015 UTC,"I would like sark back on nerd poker, failing that maybe getting Spencer Crittendon from harmontown as the DM and let Blaine get back to being a hilarious character."
Earwolf,39zpm1,bigontheinside,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:29:40 2015 UTC,"We are legion. Although in a town where every busboy has a script he'd like you to critique, I gotta believe finding another DM that isn't Sark or Spencer wouldn't be that difficult, if Brian cared enough to do so."
Earwolf,39zpm1,bigontheinside,6,Wed Jun 17 01:36:59 2015 UTC,"This is still LA improv-related, but I have no idea why Zach Woods rarely does podcasts. He's absolutely fantastic."
Earwolf,39zpm1,nohorseman,2,Tue Jun 16 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"He's always fantastic on I4H, definitely needs to be on CBB"
Earwolf,39zpm1,gregkoko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:02:26 2015 UTC,Have there been any Zach Woods CBB eps? He seems perfect for it.
Earwolf,39zpm1,El_Seven,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:18:15 2015 UTC,he was on season 2 of cbbtv but never the podcast. might tweet at scott to make this happen...

Earwolf,39zpm1,shaky_but_nice,2,Tue Jun 16 04:28:01 2015 UTC,"Echoing the OP, pretty much anyone involved with Broad City.  Abbi, Ilana, Hannibal, and especially Chris Gethard.  I was so happy he was on Womp It Up.  Would love to hear him on (a non-live) episode of CBB"
Earwolf,39zpm1,tethur,3,Tue Jun 16 16:55:40 2015 UTC,Manuel Wolff.
Earwolf,39zpm1,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Tue Jun 16 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we could lobby Scott (re: Claudia) to get him on, this was really funny. I really want to hear his reaction to all the glorious German accents we have been exposed to through Earwolf podcasts!"
Earwolf,39yqr4,CakeBoss16,3,Mon Jun 15 21:46:50 2015 UTC,I love you honey bear by FJM is one of my favorite albums ever. This videos pretty good. FJM is a weird dude
Earwolf,39yqr4,SpcAgentDaleCooper,2,Tue Jun 16 02:31:19 2015 UTC,"That album really took me by surprise, and with my favorite podcaster in his video! Weird cool dude."
Earwolf,39yqr4,UncleRatEgg,2,Tue Jun 16 05:18:19 2015 UTC,"FJM's Instagram is really bizarre as well. New album was top notch though, looking forward to catching him at Glastonbury next week."
Earwolf,39yqr4,SpcAgentDaleCooper,2,Tue Jun 16 15:26:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I follow him on IG and it's pretty funny. He was on WTF and he sounds like a cool guy but pretty odd. He should play some music on i4h or be on the hooray show or something since horatio is a big fan
Earwolf,39yisg,mi-16evil,15,Mon Jun 15 20:50:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like ""NOT Farts"" is going to be number 1 no matter what episodes come after this purely because of how much we loved Harris. Sort of like when the Oscars give an award for an actor who has died's last movie even if it wasn't really for that movie but the actor themselves."
Earwolf,39yisg,Ciandotmov,2,Tue Jun 16 00:50:26 2015 UTC,I don't think that episode should even be included in the voting. There should (and probably will) be some kind of mention of Harris including that episode but it feels wrong to compare it to other episodes and vote on it given the circumstances.
Earwolf,39yisg,coldbitterness,4,Mon Jun 22 17:23:35 2015 UTC,Ep. 342 was so great. #classicjarles

Earwolf,39xpt2,theloniousfunkd,25,Mon Jun 15 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"The episode where Tom Green talks in length about his dead dog.  All kidding a salad, I'd have to say either the Joey Tortellini ep or CBB the movie."

Earwolf,39xpt2,moremysterious,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:53:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah Scott almost didn't release it because he wasn't crazy about the quality, but I am really glad he did. It was nice to hear Harris one last time."
Earwolf,39xpt2,Slayner,4,Wed Jun 17 23:11:02 2015 UTC,Toss up of so many for me... Anniversary ep is probably my favorite. Also the Michael Abelson (Donator to kulaps indie go go) is right up there.   The Hayes and Sean ep while amazing cones after those two for sure.

Earwolf,39whpp,ixtlan,7,Mon Jun 15 16:49:06 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely was. I have a feeling these are recorded in bulk and then slowly released. That probably means we're gonna get a PFT Womp it up episode. God I hope I'm right.
Earwolf,39whpp,TheBlackSpank,3,Mon Jun 15 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"I'm only about 20 minutes in so I haven't got there yet. Usually people record multiple episodes at a time though or guests for other podcasts can sit in the room so it wouldn't surprise me.   Maybe PFT will be a guest next week, or maybe PFT was in there for the next show. Either way I'm sure you're not wrong."

Earwolf,39whpp,wmblair,9,Mon Jun 15 10:59:27 2015 UTC,This is my favorite podcast on the whole network. I figured they would run out of steam after episode 1 but I am laughing my ass off (in an office environment) with headphones on. Great show.
Earwolf,39whpp,Mr_Viper,2,Mon Jun 15 16:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had low expectations because I wasn't sure what they really could do but it's just like affirmation Nation, just a beloved character expanding their own universe outside of CBB.

I listen to a lot of podcasts and this one even more so than most others I listen to requires a lot of attention. So if you're multitasking this may not be the best podcast. It's very funny though and the interviews up top are very enjoyable.   I say it's absolutely worth listening to, but you just have to focus on the episode more is the only drawback"
Earwolf,39x84n,Slayner,7,Mon Jun 15 15:28:19 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how you start to categorize certain podcasts based on the attention needed to get the full experience. Also, certain days of the week are more exciting, or different than others based on the influx of new podcasts. Another also, podcasts specifically categorized as nighttime, or for hightime, usually both."
Earwolf,39x84n,ninzo09,6,Mon Jun 15 21:02:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear you, listening to CBB is literally the first thing I do every Monday and it's absolutely the PERFECT start to my week. The happiness and absurdity of it puts you in the necessary mindset to get out and start the work week.   And that's only one example but I know what you mean."
Earwolf,39x84n,Slayner,6,Mon Jun 15 21:06:20 2015 UTC,You just made me realise my problem with Spontaneanation. It takes me a while to realise what's happening in the scene if I stop paying attention for a minute. Improv4Humans doesn't have this problem because of the short scenes.
Earwolf,39x84n,Ciandotmov,2,Tue Jun 16 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had the same problem during my first few episodes, but I generally liked the episode and really laughed during a lot of scenes, but I had to constantly rewind to catch my place.   Then I realized this one just needs a lot more attention  So now I don't listen unless I have a good hour of JUST listening no messing with my phone (on reddit) or interruptions and I really enjoy the episodes much more now."
Earwolf,39x84n,Slayner,10,Tue Jun 16 00:50:48 2015 UTC,"I have seen a lot of negativity towards it, but personally, it is one I don't miss out on. I love the interviews with the guests, PFT is a natural talking to people and love how it leads into something crazy.  Especially wonderful when Sugerego guys show up because I feel like I am getting an inside look at how they do their shows. I agree with /u/Slayner though, you need to be able to pay attention to it, hear the whole story."
Earwolf,39x84n,JanetSnakehole24,6,Mon Jun 15 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"With the Superego guys, I'd like to add Sarah Burns and Janet Varney as 'must listen' guests."
Earwolf,39x84n,nohorseman,2,Mon Jun 15 15:44:04 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, both those ladies mix VERY well with those guys. Actually any of the guests, especially Sarah, but that may just be because I have listened to her episodes most recently. Both are great fits."
Earwolf,39x84n,JanetSnakehole24,7,Mon Jun 15 15:58:37 2015 UTC,Yes.
Earwolf,39x84n,AdmEnderDelphiki,6,Mon Jun 15 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"It's very good. The interviews with pft + guest are alone worth listening to. The improv section is also very good, but for me, it's very dependent on the line up of improvisers. Overall though it has been a very solid podcast, I look forward to it every week."
Earwolf,39x84n,Pluppets,5,Mon Jun 15 15:56:39 2015 UTC,"I really like it, and any episode with Sarah Burns makes for a good listen (especially Savannah, GA)"
Earwolf,39x84n,requisite_monocle,2,Mon Jun 15 16:39:11 2015 UTC,"Let me preface by saying that I love PFT very, very much. However, whenever I listen I have to basically skip to the improv. Every ep starts the same. PFT rambling for what feels like 10-15 minutes, laughing at his own pointless musings (pointless to me because I am not listening for that, I want to hear the man and his guests do improv...). It can become very frustrating for me trying to get through the first 30 minutes or so. Once I decided to just start skipping to the improv, I enjoyed it much more."
Earwolf,39x84n,rabidelectronics,9,Mon Jun 15 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"The improv is always full of call backs to the interview though, so you're missing a lot of jokes by doing it this way."

Earwolf,39xrza,doyouwantpancakes,2,Mon Jun 15 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"The comments section skews a little negative for me. That said, I guess the swath of pods they review is quite broad so it's likely some of the shows they review can't appeal to everyone, so I reckon some people go there for the show they like and half-shit on stuff they don't?   But they and the Splitsider Thursday thing are the only 'major'-ish outlets with a weekly article I know of."
Earwolf,39xrza,airJordan45,7,Mon Jun 15 18:04:58 2015 UTC,I miss the old format where they'd basically review every podcast.

Earwolf,39t1wd,nicemaker,25,Sun Jun 14 14:22:56 2015 UTC,"I remember watching Howard's comedy central presents when I was a kid. Up to that point my exposure to comedy had mostly been half-hours and also the ""Blue Collar"" guys, but Dragon Boy Suede did a joke that's burned in my brain because it was the first time I had heard something in comedy that actually made me think. In the set he asks his imaginary DJ ""DJ Scratchatory Rape"" to cue up the beats for the raps, he announced the name of the rap and then got into position to begin it but there was no actual sound cue so the joke ended with the punchline ""good call scratchatory, they aren't ready for that one"" and he just went back into his set. Now I'd consider that to just be a pretty good ""meta"" joke but back then I hadn't even considered that you could tell jokes in any other fashion then regular setup, regular punchline."
Earwolf,39t1wd,Emleaux,18,Sun Jun 14 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"""This next one's called Applebee's: we somehow managed to fuck up a salad."""
Earwolf,39t1wd,Emleaux,18,Sun Jun 14 17:42:49 2015 UTC,"but um...  I've been a fan of Howard since his days on Austin Stories. I remember when Who Charted? was just getting going and thinking to myself ""That goofy Jersey dude from Austin Stories is co-hosting a podcast with the wife of the guy from the Taint Misbehavin' sketch from Mr. Show?""  Since then I've donated to the show for my wife's (my wiiife!) birthday, sent Howard a book from the 70's about the magic of juicing (back when he was big into juicing to help rid himself of the clench), given him a Beachcomber coozy/koozie that he cut into a coozy cufflink on a live VPN episode and seen Who Charted? live three times (Mix-a-Lot, Gelman, Popper/Serafinowicz aka ""the Molly episode"").  Whooch is one of my favorite podcasts, and while Kulap is a great host, I listen to the podcast for all of Howard's goofiness. He's full of great one-liners and other silly stuff like that, and it all just helps me appreciate him even more. I will admit that I enjoy his Dragon Boy Suede music better than his Howard Kremer summah stuff, but it's all in good fun.  I'm glad Whooch has given Howard a way to express his quirkiness and his unique voice. I always enjoyed the way he talked and his mannerisms on Austin Stories, so it's awesome that he can be enjoyed by fans of Earwolf and of podcasts in general. Every time I've met him, he's been the nicest guy and even sometimes remembers who I am. Who could ask for anything more?  ""And to a monkey, it's a toilet.""  ""Howard, I have a question."" ""8 inches, flaccid."""

Earwolf,39t1wd,Slayner,14,Sun Jun 14 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"I have been listening to Dragon Boy Suede since I started listening to whooch. I have started listening to Howards summah albums since it's been 99 degrees outside at work.   His music is amazing.   He himself is insanely funny on whooch and twooch, every word out of his mouth whether meant to be funny or not makes me die laughing. Kulap is the perfect balance to Howards madness.   I also highly recommend binge listening to all of who and two charted. Howard will poison your mind in the best of ways, the man is a genius"

I think it's great listening to the backlog because you see Howards mind develop into more and more crazy things, but I'll be honest it does get draining binge listening to it all.   If you have the time go for it. If you don't just skip around to guests you enjoy.   Overall you can jump in at any time if you want and be fine. Great show no matter what you do"

This latest bit about liking Leon Klinghoffer more than Stephen Hawking was amazing - referencing a 30 year old incident to make a point about Ocean vs Space.  (I was on a boat when I heard it, you can tell where my allegiances lie)  However, like every one of his ideas, give it a few weeks and I'll be agreeing with him.  This is the third summer now where I'll be buying a new bathing suit specifically for the summer (my first ones had a shark on them). I dipped my feet in the ocean yesterday but didn't want to lose my swimginity yet, I'm saving it for when I'm in LA next week and I can lose it on Howard's Shores (creepier written down than in my head)  He's a great example of why podcasting is so good, he's someone who is best listened to week to week, to watch him build on themes and ideas, then come back again with a new angles over and over again.  The true genius of what he does wouldn't work on TV, wouldn't work in stand-up because it takes too long to get to the bottom of what he's thinking.  But in the podcast you get to love the journey   The other part that goes without saying is that Ku is the perfect foil for him, she keeps him in check while letting his ideas run"

Like /u/DocSub says, you can tell Jake Johnson was slightly favored in typical Hollywood fashion, but she is extremely charming and great in it. I'm proud of her! If some of your non-comedy friends see it, they would know who you were talking about very quickly, like in three words.  It's pretty flawed but a fun enough movie! I am happy to have seen it. Without Lapkus for me to root for I may have enjoyed it less honestly.  Now for TBS Clipped to take her to the top!"

Earwolf,39pdhg,nicemaker,2,Sun Jun 14 04:17:26 2015 UTC,"I was trying to write this story in the Slack chat the other day, but it became too long and involved (and boring), so this is the only place for it  On Friday I was due to spend the evening with my gfs parents.   They're great but there's a bit of a language barrier.  This was also my first Friday night with nothing to do on Saturday in months so would've preferred to go have a number of drinks somewhere and this isn't something they encourage.  On the plus side; we were going to take a boat out to an Island and get a seafood dinner, its one of my favourite things to do actually.    So I was having a relaxing beer an hour before meet time at this little bar nearby and I bumped into a couple of friends, so stopped and had a drink with them.  One was meeting his mum who was in town from Vietnam.  I had stayed with her when I visited there so knew her very well.  They told me they were heading off to dinner somewhere and were getting on a different ferry to go to that.  I walk towards the pier and see my gf, she says her parents are sick and won't be coming with us, suddenly I have a hand on my shoulder and people I know suddenly step towards me from all angles.  Someone's holding a cake, someone has a bag of cronuts - there was ten or so people coming to dinner all along and I'd been hood-winked.  I've never had a surprise party of any kind and always assumed I would figure it out.  Looking back there were a lot of tiny clues but none big enough to put them all together.    Brilliant first weekend post exam (I also went to a 2 Mich* restaurant, saw some pandas and a casino water show, but those are other stories)"

Earwolf,39pdhg,DanzigMeowMeow,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:18:25 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Mad Men but ultimately I think there was too much plot sprawl. So much stuff happened throughout the series that amounted to absolutely nothing. After awhile I think it sort of went a little too far up it's own ass, and the commercials before the second half of the final season featuring celebs fellating the show made me want to puke a little. Also I have issues watching known Scientologists and not thinking ""this person is in a batshit crazy cult"" the entire time (Elizabeth Moss).  Now that I've added that hugely negative opinion I will say that the last two Game Of Thrones have been insanely good!"
Earwolf,39pdhg,klobbermang,3,Sat Jun 13 15:07:15 2015 UTC,That Jon Snow battle sequence a couple episodes back was one of the best action scenes I've seen on TV. I hope the season finale keeps up the run of great episodes they've had lately.

In this movie I almost fast forwarded through some of the action scenes after they became boring from taking so long. Sense8 is a great idea and has some cool scenes but the pacing is terrible. At one point there are eight graphic birth scenes in a row!   Still haven't seen Cloud Atlas but enjoyed the book. I'm hopeful the long run time works for that one, but I'm also a bit skeptical."
Earwolf,39lbec,DanzigMeowMeow,6,Fri Jun 12 23:23:37 2015 UTC,Can't recommend it enough!

Earwolf,39lbec,DocSub,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:11:41 2015 UTC,Cloud Atlas and Speed Racer are great films. Jupiter Ascending is goofy and lighthearted and not worth making fun of.

Earwolf,39k7dt,obamunistpig,3,Fri Jun 12 13:58:08 2015 UTC,"This was my first thought. She has been pretty honest about struggling with getting pregnant so I hope that's what it is. The last time she talked about trying to have a baby, it made me wonder if the show would have to make adjustments for it."
Earwolf,39k7dt,kbk88,8,Fri Jun 12 14:15:26 2015 UTC,"She was just talking about having that procedure to check out her fallopian tubes or whatever a couple of weeks ago, though.

Earwolf,39k7dt,littleavalanche,0,Fri Jun 12 17:29:45 2015 UTC,I wish they'd adopt already but gosh I hope they don't read this as it is completely none of my beeswax. Everytime it's brought up I'm screaming it internally and I can't keep it inside any more
Earwolf,39k7dt,nohorseman,15,Fri Jun 12 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"As someone who's wife is going through what seem to be similar infertility issues, that's a pretty crappy thing to say. We're both open to it but we would still love to have a child of our own. Infertility is a complex problem with a lot of stress, on the woman especially and the relationship.   Obviously not everyone is the same but I know that the desire to have a child for some is the desire to have your own child and go through the whole process.   I know that there are so many children who need to be adopted but I don't think it's selfish to want to conceive a child.   Sorry if this sounds preachy but I've sort of enjoyed hearing Kulap talking about this because it's something I can relate to. I know how painful infertility can be."
Earwolf,39k7dt,weaglebeagle,3,Fri Jun 12 21:47:21 2015 UTC,thank you for sharing. It's cool to hear other peoples perspectives.   (fuck upvoting I think you deserved to see it)
Earwolf,39k7dt,istartriots,3,Sat Jun 13 09:03:37 2015 UTC,"No problem for preaching I'm not even married and am a young asshole with no perspective. My SO and I plan on adopting so it seems very obvious to me, but also we haven't faced infertility issues as we still think biological is an option for an additional kid.   I kind of realize I'm being a jerk which is why I was hesitant to ever say anything and was so worried she might see it.   Sorry for being insensitive and I hope I didn't make anything worse for you. And I love all the Earwolf hosts I spend so much time with, and want then to be happy. Good luck"
Earwolf,39k7dt,nohorseman,5,Fri Jun 12 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"No problem at all, I didn't really mean it to come across as me being upset or anything. Just wanted to give some insight."
Earwolf,39k7dt,weaglebeagle,3,Fri Jun 12 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"I truly appreciate it because it almost certainly didn't come across in my original post, but I felt bad for thinking it. I'm typically quick to defend Kulap (not that I was attacking her), just had that persistent recurring errant thought"
Earwolf,39k7dt,nohorseman,3,Sat Jun 13 00:03:28 2015 UTC,"I have heard a dozen 24 year olds talk about adopting, and not one of them knew that costs more than buying a car."
Earwolf,39k7dt,jarjarwang,2,Sat Jun 13 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"You're not being a jerk.  Adoption is unfortunately a lot of people's backup, and blessed are the people who undergo that as their default.  Just be wary, it is SO GOD DAMN EXPENSIVE.  My wife and I looked into it, and honestly...we are talking $30,000+ (if you want a baby)."
Earwolf,39k7dt,obamunistpig,2,Sat Jun 13 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"It's very interesting, for me as a man, realizing how much of identity women tie into being able to create life.  I've talked to women about infertility, and a common thread amongst them is this fear that they are ""less of a woman.""  As a young angry man, I vowed I'd only adopt.  It just made moral sense.  But now I realize how important it is for my wife to have this life experience, and I support her in that decision."
Earwolf,39k7dt,obamunistpig,9,Sat Jun 13 15:26:16 2015 UTC,lol I'm sure they are aware of adoption as a concept!

Earwolf,39k7dt,cameronxylo,7,Fri Jun 12 11:58:04 2015 UTC,"They both seemed pretty excited about them, and they both called them ""fun, not wacky"" changes.

Earwolf,39k7dt,summahdaze,3,Fri Jun 12 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"She said that she couldn't say much about it, it sounded like she might have just accidentally let it slip. It was easy to miss."

Earwolf,39k7dt,summahdaze,4,Fri Jun 12 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"If I'm remembering correctly it was this week's Whooch. Also your tone seems fine to me, nothing wrong with a straight forward question :)"
Earwolf,39k7dt,darlini,4,Fri Jun 12 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"In the Scotty Auck episode from the beginning of this year, he suggested doing a TV chart since Howard hates movies. Assuming it's something to do with mixing up the movie chart, and maybe the tweet chart?"
Earwolf,39k7dt,Prax150,6,Fri Jun 12 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"There was a certain tone in Howard's voice this ep, or was it just me?  Anyway, I hope it isn't anything crazy. But I wouldn't mind a bit of a format change. I've been saying a lot lately that the charts they do on the main show need revamping. The music chart is fine since there's a certain variety to it and anyone can speak about music so long as it falls within the realm of their taste.  But the movie chart is generally pretty bad. Howard knows little about movies and doesn't care for them. Kulap is better but she doesn't offer any insight I could get listening to another podcast, and the guest is seldom into movies. I don't expect them to see everything, obviously, but they do a movie chart and often get facts wrong and have trouble distinguishing between domestic and international box office for instance. I'm not saying drop the movie chart, or even change how they do it, but if there's variety in the music chart there could be in the second chart too. Like do the movie chart one week, a TV chart the next, maybe a book chart. Mix it up."
Earwolf,39k7dt,Randy_Tutelage,10,Fri Jun 12 14:54:57 2015 UTC,I for one enjoy Howard's sight unseen movie reviews.
Earwolf,39k7dt,the_the_the_,5,Fri Jun 12 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if they actually discussed movies, it'd be pretty uninteresting to me."
Earwolf,39k7dt,Randy_Tutelage,6,Fri Jun 12 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely,i prefer Howard to shit on movies he has never even seen the trailer for, that's funny. If I want some serious discussion of films on a podcast I'll download an ep of ""i love films"""
Earwolf,39k7dt,House_Of_Pies,3,Fri Jun 12 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"I LOVE ""I Love Films"""
Earwolf,39k7dt,Prax150,2,Sat Jun 13 08:00:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them too, it just bothers me when they get their facts wrong. But I love films."
Earwolf,39k7dt,nohorseman,3,Fri Jun 12 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"Yes that's what I'm settling on too. I really hope they don't stop the two eps a week thing though!   I say let the guest pick what media realm etc. they want to talk about. Or even make a chart themselves, like how Professor Blastoff and Don't Get Me Started let the guest choose the topic a bit. With an emphasis on pop culture.   4 times out of 5 I enjoy Twooch more than Whooch so I'd love em to bring up the divide.   I was slightly worried when Kulap mentioned the Women in Podcast festival made her say ""If I leave podcasting.."""
Earwolf,39k7dt,shazbotica,3,Fri Jun 12 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe they'll move ""Two Charted"" to earlier in the week... maybe it becomes ""Tue Charted""? I'm a new listener, but they seem to often say ""I'll save it for Two Charted"" or ""I can't talk about this until Two Charted"" because they don't want to take attention away from the guest during the Wed eps."
Earwolf,39k7dt,ecctv,3,Fri Jun 12 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of Ku's recent chart music, but since stereo gum thanked her for it, I doubt she will stop using it soon."
Earwolf,39k7dt,JasmineForsythe,17,Fri Jun 12 09:52:20 2015 UTC,"I love it. It gives us the opportunity to hear music we may never have heard otherwise, and every now and then you get a song that's really good. I've gotten into a few artists from it"
Earwolf,39k7dt,oshoney,6,Fri Jun 12 11:03:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. My tastes line up with Stereogum pretty well so it works for me.
Earwolf,39k7dt,nohorseman,6,Fri Jun 12 13:27:56 2015 UTC,I love it too. She doesnt seem to really love picking out music (just one song for her whole chart) so it's a look into a different culture than what Howard likes to expose us to
Earwolf,39k7dt,CrouchJr,6,Fri Jun 12 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"It is nice to hear new sounds.  I feel like she is extremely diplomatic with the music though, she seems to say that she likes every song that comes on."

Earwolf,39g03i,ksaid1,17,Thu Jun 11 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"I thought it was hilarious when she said that her uncle works at the White House as a chef who knows how to flay meat, but then Scottie Too Hotty just changed it to the kids being the murderers.

Earwolf,39g03i,airJordan45,19,Thu Jun 11 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"They also initially insinuate their dad was the culprit, getting rid of the witnesses of the book club. I think it totally whooshed on scott"
Earwolf,39g03i,theav,13,Thu Jun 11 16:34:54 2015 UTC,I'm not too sure Middleditch and Lapkus had decided on the killer before they started. A lot of that episode feels like they're making up the mystery as they go along. Although I suppose that could just be because Scott ruined their original plan and they had to improvise.
Earwolf,39g03i,sleepsholymountain,4,Thu Jun 11 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"Im not saying that was planned, i think it came from the improvisation, but it seemed to me like they laid alot of tracks scott might not have picked up on and thus the improv led to them being the killers."
Earwolf,39g03i,theav,18,Thu Jun 11 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Scott absolutely picked up on it, but that's how improv works. You just keep moving. Scott kept asking questions, and Tom and Lauren could have brought things back to the uncle or their dad at any time. They didn't, because they thought making the boy have crazy mind powers and making the two kid detectives into murderers was funnier."
Earwolf,39g03i,catocatocato,15,Thu Jun 11 16:57:22 2015 UTC,That's a lot of why I love him as a host. It seems like often catches on to the direction the guests are driving the bit and purposefully redirects it in the interest of absurdity.
Earwolf,39g03i,catglass,16,Thu Jun 11 19:52:38 2015 UTC,I totally agree. And it got fed back to him last year with the robot sex dog. Scott kept trying to push it in a direction where he wasn't the perv but it kept coming back. I don't think I've ever laughed that hard.

Earwolf,39g03i,catglass,7,Fri Jun 12 02:40:14 2015 UTC,"I would contend that they didnt bring it back because scott took it a totally different way. Which is fine, i loffed my whole shit off. But you cant say that they decided a different narrative is funnier when its improv and it could go anywhere but we'll never know. Scott did not have the story mapped out when he glossed over things the kids were saying."

The first episode I ever listened to was The Stallone Bros. (#241, with Nick Kroll and Paul Scheer). I hated it because I had no idea what CBB was, and I wanted to hear some BTS stories from The League.  A few months later I decided to give the show another shot, and I picked this episode because I love Tim Meadows. It was in the middle of midterms, and I was in the library crying from trying to stifle my laughter."

I think it was either legitimately funny or just pleasantly laid-back. Mtv played some interesting shows back then.    It was really strange clicking the Who Charted button on Earwolf for the first time, since I'd wondered off and on for years whatever happened to that weird-looking Creamer guy from that show I liked. Great story, huh?"
Earwolf,39fa74,Ciandotmov,13,Thu Jun 11 09:39:16 2015 UTC,"Great episode. I think Mookie is fairly under-rated when it comes to I4H, I always enjoy him on. And for some reason Stephanie is really good as the 'girlfriend, wife' type of scene, she plays a great straight(wo)man   Loved that goggle scene."
Earwolf,39fa74,Slayner,9,Thu Jun 11 13:09:03 2015 UTC,"I just came here to say Mookie is the most under-rate performer, I would love to see him make the rounds more often.  I meet him once on a trip out to LA and got a chance to see his performance show.  He did this sketch where he basically got naked on stage while eating and dancing, had me doubled over in laughter for the entire time. Was such a nice guy after the show too.    At one point Mookie launches into scene by singing some song over Besser telling a story.  Besser seemed genuinely thrown off for a second, but they pulled the scene together so nicely.  Mookie's like 2 steps ahead at any given point, I just love hearing his work."
Earwolf,39fa74,Effective_Aggression,4,Thu Jun 11 14:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah most of his performances on I4H, and CBB are hilarious. I don't have any experiences seeing him live but that's awesome to hear as well.   It's part of the reason I love podcasts so much, you learn about these severely underrated comedians"

Earwolf,39fa74,Effective_Aggression,6,Thu Jun 11 14:15:06 2015 UTC,My favorite scene he's done on I4H was the angry atheist guy. That voice he did was just too perfect. It's probably my favorite I4H scene
Earwolf,39fa74,Slayner,2,Thu Jun 11 14:16:55 2015 UTC,YES! That's a great scene.  Happen to have an eps # handy or who the other guests were?  I'd like to revisit it.

Earwolf,39fa74,katiebug88,3,Thu Jun 11 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"I think it would be interesting to hear Matt and Todd Glass discuss the ""apology culture"" stuff that they got into at the end of this ep. I can see where they are both coming from and i would like to see how they debate with each other."
Earwolf,39fa74,House_Of_Pies,2,Thu Jun 11 14:33:24 2015 UTC,I honestly think he and Todd Glass would agree. Their positions are not mutually exclusive.
Earwolf,39fa74,godisapropernoun,2,Fri Jun 12 04:03:30 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard Todd Glass talk about that before, what is his position? Like Matt, it feels like most comedians hold the firm belief that nothing is off limits, there is no ""too soon,"" and that it is ok to make misogynistic, racist, or generally terrible comments under the guise of ""its just a joke."" Would love to hear an opposing point of view."
Earwolf,39fa74,hdlsa,4,Thu Jun 11 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"Well it may not be exactly that subject, but Todd Glass has been discussing the subject of comedians saying offensive things (such as using the word faggot or retarded or just using offensive words in general) under the guise of ""its just a joke"" or ""he is a comedian thats just his thing.""  I am paraphrasing here and it should be known that ive only listened to a few eps of the todd glass show. But specifically the episodes with PFT they discuss this."
Earwolf,39fa74,House_Of_Pies,5,Thu Jun 11 17:52:48 2015 UTC,"I think Matt would bring up ""the law of economics"" to that, if they do it in a way that doesn't work people will hold them accountable for it and they won't be able to make any money as a comedian and they'll have to find something else to do. I agree with Matt's point, but I also think a lot of comedians say offensive things just to be edgy/shocking and that bugs me. If there's nothing behind the joke and it's just a comedian being offensive that seems like lazy writing and not really even a joke to me, however, some comedians are able to use offensive language and get away with it- usually because they are making fun of the kinds of people who use that language."
Earwolf,39fa74,katiebug88,2,Thu Jun 11 21:09:20 2015 UTC,Yeah i think i agree with Matt but i can see what Todd is saying too. I think it would be a very entertaining and knowledgeable discussion

Earwolf,39fa74,Slayner,4,Thu Jun 11 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"The majority of this episode was really good, but was anyone else put off by Matt's rant at the end? I can usually at least semi-agree with his cranky social opinions (or at least not cringe through them), but this week he seemed entirely wrong. The overwhelming silence of this week's guests throughout his talk only emphasized (to me anyway) how off course Matt's rambling was.  I was especially shocked/disappointed to hear Matt riding hard for all three of the ""equal opportunity offender"" ""that's just his personality"" and ""don't censor me"" fallacies. Each one of those is an example of the laziest type of (incorrect) thinking.  (Yes, there is tendency now for some people to want be offended solely so they can enjoy being self-righteous and not for any greater purpose or attempt at progressing social norms, but that also doesn't automatically invalidate every critique they selfishly make for the wrong reasons.)  Anyway, I normally love hearing Matt get riled up about some perceived social injustice, but this week felt like listening to my granddad explain how his bigoted opinions weren't actually all that bigoted."
Earwolf,39fa74,patteca,-2,Fri Jun 12 22:36:59 2015 UTC,"Please expound upon his fallacies, and why they are particularly lazy.  It sounds like your argument is poorly thought out and opinion based, but in case you have some numbers I thought I'd give the benefit of the doubt."

Anyway, PFT really started going overboard with the ""duuuuh/uhhhh/ehhhhh"" humming sound that he does as Thicke. Someone asks if he does that because it's musical (or something like that, offering a reason why he does it.) Thick answers, ""Uhhh,errr, no, there's something wrong with my brain.""  I think there are other times that PFT has used that phrase to refer to OCD-like symptoms, and it fucking cracks me up. Ironically, that phrase ""There's something wrong with my brain"" often gets stuck with me  EDIT: Found it! I was actually way off. It's the 2013 CBB Live Toronto episode with Sean Cullen. At about 28 minutes they start talking about the Growing Pains theme song. Scott & Thicke sing some of it.    Then Thicke says, ""not one I wrote, but one that I sing every day from start to finish.

Earwolf,39c7rk,gladvillain,10,Wed Jun 10 22:30:38 2015 UTC,Me too. I have seen my fair share of heroes idols and other celebrities I like die. But this one and Jim Henson got me hard. Harris was so fucking talented and I was such a big fan. What a waste and a loss.

Earwolf,39c7rk,GnarledCandy,2,Thu Jun 11 03:28:05 2015 UTC,"This hit me a little too.  It would seem so forced if he were wearing a suit.  Knowing that he was laid to rest wearing comfy pj pants, a shirt of his favorite band, and holding drumsticks... I don't know, it's like you can almost picture Harris appreciating it.  ""If I'm gonna be stuck wearing the same thing forever, I don't want to be in a fucking suit.  Gimmie some comfy PJ pants and a Phish shirt."""

Earwolf,39jt1o,the_reciever,13,Fri Jun 12 05:46:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think his style meshes with Scott's at all. He's more along the lines of Nick DiPaolo, Bill Burr and Louie CK than Andy Daly and other Earwolf guys; mostly because his stuff is more stand-up oriented rather than improv."
Earwolf,39jt1o,CurtBaboon,3,Fri Jun 12 06:03:31 2015 UTC,"Agree, CurtBaboon. Having listened to O&A until A's firing, while Yimmy is great for short bursts of characs and improv, I don't think he'd do a long-form character in an improv setting.  Also , (some) NY stand-ups seem to hold the improv community-and improv as a whole-in low regard. I remember Louis C.K. and Jim bashing improv as more of a technique than an art (paraphrasing)."

Earwolf,39jt1o,tppatterson223,2,Sat Jun 13 00:19:42 2015 UTC,"As a Jerseyite I enjoy hearing the regional references and general attitude. The basic geographical point on Earwolf is very West Coast-centric. I also find Gino hilarious. He reminds me of a million guys around here. It's an affectionate parody of the type, and pretty spot-on."
Earwolf,39jt1o,krankortega,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:24:24 2015 UTC,This seems like a reasonable example of some Jimmy doing some long-form character improv. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKQeMKT9CMM

I don't know if he'd go along with the irony heavy CBB stuff."
Earwolf,39jt1o,istartriots,-1,Fri Jun 12 09:14:17 2015 UTC,"While I agree that ""Jim"" is more stand-up oriented, if you listen to his characters like, ""Ted the lightbulb expert"" or ""Grocery Man"" it seems right up Scott's alley."

Earwolf,39bntw,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,3,Wed Jun 10 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"It's in the first ~25 minutes of the second YMIW with Harris, and they talk about how weird an environment it was. Harris said at some point he was ""just a writer, not an actor or comedian"" which is basically career suicide at these events."
Earwolf,39bntw,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,2,Wed Jun 10 19:38:58 2015 UTC,"The Just for Laughs set posted above. Pete and Harris were there, they were being ""judged"" on their sets by a panel, and it was apparently a very bizarre situation. Like I said, they talk about it within the first 25 minutes on the podcast.  ""Career suicide"" is definitely hyperbolic, but it's not a good idea at all to go to the most prestigious comedy festival in the world and talk to a room full of industry people about how you're really not an actor or a comedian."

Earwolf,39axam,Adjective_Animal,2,Thu Jun 11 03:10:53 2015 UTC,Yeah early on there was that weird frenetic editing that made it hard to follow. Glad they toned that down.

Earwolf,39bv57,nohorseman,5,Wed Jun 10 19:11:57 2015 UTC,It's kind of jarring to hear Sean out of character. I listened to part of it and found myself wanting to listen to all of the songs they were playing in full. I hadn't even heard of this show until Sean tweeted it out today!

Earwolf,399r23,mrbananagrabber1,6,Wed Jun 10 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the whole thing, it's been like five years. But, as I recall, they were going to make a podcast called Cyberthug Radio (they actually recorded a couple eps). However, Minor and his sidekick, Miles Archer, didn't like the contract offered primarily because it would have given Earwolf ownership over the characters (which they had performed elsewhere for some time, I think). Earwolf had some similar problems with Nerd Poker early on, but they got worked out after a few months. I think the company just had some weird growing pains earlier on.  Anyways, Minor and Archer decided to walk away, and  didn't appear on any Earwolf podcast again until just recently (I think he showed up on the Tv show too)."

The half-hour, set in a women’s basketball league, has landed at Comedy Central.  Created by and starring Lund, Blasucci and actress Angela Trimbur,"

I first encountered him on Silicon Valley, then heard his Who Charted ep and was surprised at how hilarious he was in such a different way than his SV character. He's genuinely hilarious, a great improviser, and I have loved all his CBB appearances."
Earwolf,397cn9,gladvillain,16,Tue Jun 9 20:35:10 2015 UTC,Bonus info: he and Benny Swazz were comedy partners just like Sean and Hayes.
Earwolf,397cn9,WeeBabySeamus,15,Tue Jun 9 21:01:37 2015 UTC,Benny Swazz house of pies?  This makes a lot of sense.  Also Sean and Hayes have such a great chemistry.  I bet when they first met the vibe between the two must have been immediate.
Earwolf,397cn9,gladvillain,8,Tue Jun 9 21:43:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I notice all the work they do together from following Benny on IG and Twitter. There's just so many comedians in the scene now that it's hard to follow all of them."
Earwolf,397cn9,ksaid1,5,Tue Jun 9 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Benny Schwa and Tommy Mids make a great team... most of the time. They both appeared on an episode of ""If I Were You"" (an advice podcast) and it was pretty great. In all of his previous solo appearances, Thomas always tried to give thoughtful, legitimate advice. But in all of Ben's previous appearances, he spent the whole time singing songs, playing games, basically trying to derail the whole podcast without ever answering a single question. So when they were on the same episode together, there was an awkward moment at the beginning where they thought they were going to make a great team, but quickly realised they were basically each others' worst enemies :p"
Earwolf,397cn9,changry_perdvert,10,Wed Jun 10 05:34:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah its kinda crazy that he is most famous for his Silicon Valley character when that is so antithetical to his normal comic persona.  I feel like his talents are being not taken advantage of fully.  He was incredible on Hollywood Handbook as well, which was my first exposure to him other than Silicon Valley and his classic fish bowl routine in Wolf of Wall Street."
Earwolf,397cn9,verty101,11,Tue Jun 9 21:18:07 2015 UTC,His Joey Tortellini character was fantastic. He's the best new guest CBB has had in a long while.

Honestly, if you don't like characters, CBB is not for you. That's the main appeal. Maybe try Mike and Tom Eat Snacks, Doug Loves Movies, How Did This Get Made?"
Earwolf,399ewq,Space_Wanderer,19,Wed Jun 10 05:38:25 2015 UTC,Never not funny with jimmy pardo is a lot of fun conversation. Not as serious as Marc marón
Earwolf,399ewq,SpcAgentDaleCooper,9,Wed Jun 10 06:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah CBB probably isn't your cup of tea man. If you like some quick improv maybe give improv 4 humans a shot, it's really good and even if you don't like one scene it doesn't last long and they jump into another pretty often.   Other than that, idk many earwolf podcasts if you're not into the absurdity or character based comedy.   I Mean there's Hollywood Handbook, which doesn't have characters, but it's about as absurd as it gets"
Earwolf,399ewq,Slayner,2,Wed Jun 10 11:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that Hollywood Handbook is only characters, except when they get the rare guest who won't play along."
Earwolf,399ewq,catglass,2,Thu Jun 11 20:04:30 2015 UTC,Have you listened to Sean and Hayes outside of earwolf?   It's not so much characters as much as it is exaggerated versions of themselves. They still act stupid and crazy outside of HH just to a way way lesser extent
Earwolf,399ewq,Slayner,2,Thu Jun 11 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've heard Hayes, but I've heard Sean on a few things. Obviously, they're comedians so they're always going to be practicing a craft, but I think when the exaggeration reaches the point it does on HH you can call them characters, especially since they really never break except to laugh. Maybe caricatures would be more appropriate, but then it feels like splitting hairs.  Either way, it's downright magical regardless of terminology."
Earwolf,399ewq,catglass,2,Thu Jun 11 20:21:20 2015 UTC,I guess I can agree with that. I just don't see it as the broad sense that OP was describing about CBB but that's a fair way of thinking about it
Earwolf,399ewq,Slayner,8,Thu Jun 11 20:26:48 2015 UTC,"You might like the Hostful episodes of the Nerdist podcast.  It's just the 3 main hosts without a guest, just hanging out.  They're few and far between lately, but can be a lot of fun.  And they're usually pretty tight, an hour or so long.  Maybe Smodcast or FEaB too, those are pretty chill.  I'm surprised you didn't like UTU2TM, that was going to be my first suggestion.  I couldn't care less about U2, but I don't think I laugh at anything harder than Scott and Scott talking about dicks and butts."

Earwolf,399ewq,stephenstories,5,Wed Jun 10 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Comedy Bang Bang is definitely a very character-focused show. If you'd like to get some more Scott Aukerman content, you could try just running a search for his name on iTunes and listen to some of his guest appearances on other podcasts.  Off the top of my dome, the only character-less episode I can think of is Episode 121: Bro-ing Out, with Jimmy Pardo, Paul Rust, and Rob Delaney. That was pretty fun."

Earwolf,399ewq,mm825,6,Wed Jun 10 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"CBB episodes without characters are very few and far between. The characters are really the backbone of the podcast. Your best bet would be venturing into the early days (back when it was called Comedy Death Ray Radio) before it really settled into place. That, or just listening to the first half/interview segment of each episode and turning it off when the characters come out.  Also, if your getting frustrated by the length of podcasts, try finding something you can do while listening to them. Driving, exercising, playing video games, drawing, etc... anything that doesnt require use of your ears or intense focus really helps me get through podcasts and actually helps me retain a little bit more from it aswell."
Earwolf,399ewq,Pluppets,5,Wed Jun 10 07:03:11 2015 UTC,Maybe something like judge john hodgman?  Or another /r/maximunfun podcast?
Earwolf,399ewq,CrouchJr,2,Wed Jun 10 13:15:48 2015 UTC,Seconding this. I think between My Brother My Brother and Me/Jordan Jesse Go there's a podcast that would fit this guy better over there.

Earwolf,399ewq,unholypencil,6,Wed Jun 10 13:20:35 2015 UTC,"I think you just need to open up and enjoy yourself! How sad would it be if the only comedy you like comes from a guy who died when he was 30 with just a few scant hours of material?  And remember the Foam Corner was prepared bits. Lots of CBB and Earwolf is improvised, it isn't going to be tight like that.   That said, some other comedians you might like: Joe Mande (went to school with Harris so has a similar vibe, although he doesn't show up on podcasts so often), Jon Gabrus (very quick witted), Chelsea Peretti (silly AND mean), Jimmy Pardo.   And yeah you aren't likely to enjoy a podcast if you just put your headphones in and stare at the wall. They're meant to be enjoyed while driving, at the gym, doing boring stuff at work /chores. That's the appeal."
Earwolf,399ewq,nohorseman,3,Wed Jun 10 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"Alright, as others have said, CBB is pretty character-driven so if that annoys you, you probably just shouldn't listen to it. Improv4Humans tends to be a little less character-y (more stuff is grounded in reality than on CBB), but it can still get crazy. I also enjoy The Nerdist, but it's not so much a comedy show as it is an conversation with (usually) comedy people.  If you still want to do CBB, go here and scroll through looking for episodes where there are no guests with an ""as"" after their name. You could probably figure out a way to do this in excel so you can get a full list without having to do it manually, but I'm at work right now and can't take the time to do it."
Earwolf,399ewq,Antonton,2,Wed Jun 10 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend WTF with Marc Maron probably. They're relatively short and he usually gets some really interesting guests. I prefer You Made It Weird with Pete Holmes and Never Not Funny, but both of those shows can push over 2 hours."
Earwolf,399ewq,RedFrogMario,2,Wed Jun 10 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"The only one that comes to mind is the one with Todd Glass and James Adomian. Instead of one of Adomians characters they actually engage in thoughtful and funny conversation. I didn't like the characters at first but have since come to love it, it just takes sometime to adjust to hearing characters rather than seeing them."
Earwolf,399ewq,lovers_acid,2,Wed Jun 10 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"Why not just listen to the first 30 minutes or so of CBB? If you want a short podcast and no characters with Scott Aukerman hosting, that'll usually do it. Shut it off at the break, before the character comes along.  Aside from that, you might like Stop Podcasting Yourself, which I think more people should listen to. It's just two comics from Vancouver chatting with a guest, usually a local comic. It's very low key, but hilarious. Maybe start with one of the Paul F. Tompkins episodes. He's a fan of the show and a fairly frequent guest. Maybe this one:  http://www.maximumfun.org/stop-podcasting-yourself/stop-podcasting-yourself-171-paul-f-tompkins  Or this one:  http://www.maximumfun.org/stop-podcasting-yourself/stop-podcasting-yourself-205-paul-f-tompkins  I haven't listened to those particular episodes in years, but PFT is always fun to listen to."
Earwolf,399ewq,86themayo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:15:15 2015 UTC,The PFT Stop Podcasting Yourself episodes are a great recommendation. On top of that maybe the PFT episodes of The Todd Glass Show. Depends on if  you jive with Todd or not.
Earwolf,399ewq,AgentMullWork,2,Wed Jun 10 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"If you like ""funny people having funny conversations"" I can't recommend Harmontown enough. Plus! They recently started doing video episodes (some are on youtube for free) so there's you visual stimulant!  Happy listening!"
Earwolf,399ewq,IngmarBergmanAMA,2,Wed Jun 10 22:57:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations! You guys seem like an awesome community, I really didn't expect this much feedback. I'm just gonna reply here rather than replying to everyone.  Sounds like CBB may be somewhat out of my element, at least until I become a little more comfortable with podcasts as a whole, so I'll try out some of the others suggested (Never Not Funny, Mike and Tom Eat Snacks, and Harmantown sound the most appealing based on the people involved and level of support from you guys). I also may just do the first 20-30 minutes of CBB like some of you suggested - that seems weird to do for tv/movies or other mediums, but I guess podcasts don't really have ""plots"" the same way so while I may miss some great moments it's not a big deal to just cut it off. I'm also gonna give Talking U2 another shot.  To those with suggestions for how to listen without getting bored, unfortunately I'm a pretty terrible multitasker so when I try to listen while working I either don't get any work done or don't hear any of the podcast, but I do like listening to them on long drives.  Thanks again!"

It also had a couple thumb tacks, half of a really old fish stick, a cardboard mask of Jim Carrey, and a ball of tin foil that had been partially colored with a blue magic marker. It came in a Taco Bell bag wrapped in duct tape. Money well spent."
Earwolf,394ub0,TheBlackSpank,3,Tue Jun 9 14:46:09 2015 UTC,Is the cardboard mask of Jim Carrey in color? If it is I am sold.
Earwolf,394ub0,Mizghetti,8,Tue Jun 9 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"No, it's also just a really poor drawing in pen, but Sean wrote ""Jim Carrey"" on the forehead.

Earwolf,394ub0,TheBlackSpank,10,Tue Jun 9 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"This ep was short but sweet! I was brutally shyamalaned by this episode's shocking reveal, that /u/giraffeking also kindly warns you of. Everyone please be near a fainting couch and loosen your corset, and avoid having liquids in your mouth for extended periods of time during the Guest segment  Also, because when I listen to HH now I see Matrix code:  The Eh.. Wrong was from a text convo Spenny and the Jets posted in the forums in the Ross Mathews thread because he thought it was funny. I think it's hilarious that characters of the show find a negative comment presented in jest on page 5 of the forums thread and feel the need to address it for several minutes."

Earwolf,3940f9,ELBdelorean,4,Tue Jun 9 17:15:55 2015 UTC,"Shit, I never should have asked!  I just remembered in an interview with PFT he said every time some asks him about the podcast he delays it another month."

Earwolf,3940f9,No_name_Johnson,2,Wed Jun 10 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's been officially stated. Andy made reference to ""future episodes"" in the last episode of the show I believe and referenced a character named Spark Plug. Gourley, when talking about podcasts he's on in Spontaneanation and maybe in one episode of Pistol Shrimps Radio, says the ADPPP in a way that SOUNDS like it's not over. That could very reading way too into his tone.  Either way, I haven't heard official confirmation but I wouldn't be surprised if there was more."

Earwolf,394ep1,broshingo,7,Tue Jun 9 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"Yes it seemed to come up very organically on Whooch but Howard may have had parts of it bouncing around in his head beforehand that were more fully realized.   /u/Slayner may know better than me as he's almost through his relisten, but I'm pretty sure the lot of it is covered a bit in 178 but then mostly in 178.5 -- the one week of shows when Kulap was back from Laos and before Howard went on tour with Brody. 178 is with Harris so is a hell of a listen anyway, and I'm like 70% sure the rest of it is then matching Twhooch ep."
Earwolf,394ep1,nohorseman,5,Tue Jun 9 04:39:27 2015 UTC,My only desire in life is to have an equally expansive and encyclopedic compendium of earwolf in my head.
Earwolf,394ep1,BertSnerpis,4,Tue Jun 9 07:50:34 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right. I thought it came up on a Twooch first where Howard was doing the ""hairy spider"" bit, and I think that exotic animal thing led him to Orangutans.   I do feel like it evolved over a few episodes too, because he also talked about it (at length) with Ku once she came back."
Earwolf,394ep1,GeorgeTaylorG,7,Tue Jun 9 05:33:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Howard had a whole thing about Ku banging a Gu at the falls of Luang Prabang even before  her trip to Laos (I think it may have come up when her and Scottie went on a tropical vacation somewhere too, now that I think about it). I think that plus his whole thing about animal odd couples/interspecies friendships sort of evolved in the Gu cruise concept.  Might be a little off on the timing, but he definitely had all that stuff swirling around his cranium."
Earwolf,394ep1,spikey666,5,Tue Jun 9 08:32:04 2015 UTC,Right! The Costa Rica trip was probably the genesis of all this.  Trying to piece this together is insane.
Earwolf,394ep1,GeorgeTaylorG,2,Tue Jun 9 17:02:12 2015 UTC,Yes that sounds right
Earwolf,394ep1,nohorseman,4,Tue Jun 9 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the lot of it is covered a bit in 178   I'm like 99% sure this is the episode. Kulap had just gotten back from Laos. Howard mistakenly thought Orangutans lived there and made a comment about going down there for a ""Gu Cruise"" or something along those lines, and Kulap was horrified because she thought he said something else."
Earwolf,394ep1,sleepsholymountain,3,Tue Jun 9 13:06:22 2015 UTC,"Wow it's so funny you mention that Harris episode and than twooch episode. The last episode I listened to yesterday was that Harris ep, and I'm on that twooch now.   (also not looking forward to the Howard less episodes with armen coming up)"
Earwolf,394ep1,Slayner,5,Tue Jun 9 11:26:51 2015 UTC,Have you listened to them before?  I love the armen eps
Earwolf,394ep1,patrickthewhite1,3,Tue Jun 9 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Just yesterday I re-listened to the Armen ep with Scotty boy, so funny. ""I'm Ching Chong."""
Earwolf,394ep1,LaurenLapkus,2,Tue Jun 9 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"Only a couple, I'm still going through the backlog there haven't been many. So far though I can't say I'm the biggest armen fan."
Earwolf,394ep1,Slayner,3,Tue Jun 9 16:05:15 2015 UTC,Personally I think they improve as they go along. You start to cheer for him alongside kulap. And certain guests' reactions to him are hilarious imo. However I know he's very divisive on this sub so I think I'm in the minority
Earwolf,394ep1,patrickthewhite1,5,Tue Jun 9 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm team Armen too! I love all the Emerson boys (Harris, Mande, Armen). Armen has trouble being articulate on podcasts, but the other two's endorsement of him lets me give him the benefit of the doubt and interpret funny stuff he says as ""clever"" rather than ""accidental."" Plus the recent Ku Armen twooch was very touching. And Whiplash i4h is one of my favorite podcast episodes."
Earwolf,394ep1,nohorseman,3,Tue Jun 9 16:26:26 2015 UTC,I'm not a big Armen fan but boy howdy do you need to listen to the one with Matt Besser. That's an all time classic. The one with Scott is pretty good too. I found the rest of them to be difficult to listen to. I want to like Armen but it's so hard.
Earwolf,394ep1,weaglebeagle,3,Tue Jun 9 19:13:10 2015 UTC,"I'll get there soon, I'm going in order. Already listened to the Scott one though that one was funny"
Earwolf,394ep1,Slayner,3,Tue Jun 9 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, Ku was talking about visiting Laos and Howard asked something about orangoutangs and if they rode jet-skis. I am not sure the exact wording. What I do know is that for some reason Howard thought Gu Cruise's were real and just assumed that was a real thing that happened in Laos. I'm sure if its just a great bit ( and I love great bits) or Howie is crazy. Either way its fuckin great"

Earwolf,39090d,Aquaman_Forever,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:24:23 2015 UTC,"Is it unfair for me to compare this to the Pod F Tomkast?   What's funny is that when this show first started, Paul commented on how people will unfairly compare the two and that won't do him any favors. I agreed at the time.  Now, after straining to get into Spontaneanation but really struggling, I have to admit I am now again holding out hope that he will produce another season of the Pod F Tomkast. I think Paul is a great character improviser, a good interviewer, and a really great writer. Is it crazy to say that longer-form improv is not one of his stronger suits?  Edit: and I want to add more info here. I know Paul chose the total improv route because its much less time-consuming and frankly more suitable for podcasting. What I think I'm saying is that a significant amount of Paul's career has turned into interviewing/improving, and I wonder if he considers that a compromise on his part because of struggles to monetize other projects?"
Earwolf,39090d,jarluch,2,Mon Jun 8 16:32:09 2015 UTC,How is he not great at long form improv? Each episode has been fantastic albeit needing a listener undivided attention or you lose where they are in a scene. So can you give a specific example as to why he is not a good at long form improv?
Earwolf,39090d,CakeBoss16,6,Wed Jun 10 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"Spontaneanation is a brief riff and interview followed by a ~40 min single scenario improv with about 4 performers.  Pod F Tompkast was a longer riff, produced/written bits involving PFT characters and his stage show, an interview/story from Jen Kirkman, and occasional other stuff.   Even where the shows have similarities, they are still very different in tone and substance."

I saw her do an ASSSSCAT with the UCB4 + Woods, Sanz and Wengert and not only did she hold her own up there, she stole some scenes and got some of the biggest laughs of the night. She's an improv force of nature, and her podcast just fits what she does so well, it's perfect for her.   ALL HAIL LAUREN LAPKUS"

Earwolf,38wroz,macrowive,10,Sun Jun 7 17:47:19 2015 UTC,I love that moment in the beginning of an episode you hear her little laugh in the background and you know it'll be a good one.
Earwolf,38wroz,Meet_Loaf,10,Sun Jun 7 19:18:19 2015 UTC,I absolutely love when Lauren takes things in a more blue direction. HO-HO is my favorite of her CBB characters. And one of my favorite i4h eps of hers is when she has spent most of the episode talking about butt stuff and then Besser launches into a scene about how she seems obssessed with butt stuff.
Earwolf,38wroz,House_Of_Pies,5,Sun Jun 7 15:42:07 2015 UTC,Was that the first wild horses ep? Because I think that was also the episode where you get to hear Lauren discover what smegma is in real time. She has a horrified reaction and Besser immediately launches into a scene with her as a customer in a rare cheese shop.
Earwolf,38wroz,Velvet_Llama,2,Mon Jun 8 01:00:05 2015 UTC,That ep that you are describing is definitely the with the Wild Horses and its wonderful. But the one i was describing was different i think because i am vaguely remembering another male guest in that ep.
Earwolf,38wroz,House_Of_Pies,12,Mon Jun 8 01:28:14 2015 UTC,"There's not much to say that hasn't been said, so I'll just share my appreciation specifically for her podcast With Special Guest Lauren Lapkus.   I was pretty vocal about not being a crazy big fan at the beginning and I thought her 'Earwolf celebrity' status was causing it to get more love than it was worth  Nevertheless I tuned in each week, because I LOVED the premise, and I mean -- come on it's Lapkus, it's gonna be worth a listen.   And those weeks of tuning in paid off tenfold. It's in my top 5 and makes me look forward to Friday (for podcast reasons) It's been on a damn role, but it does rely heavily on who the 'host' is that week, which is a small flaw, but Lauren is doing an amazing job with it, and if you're not listening you need to.   Aside from that, just the usual stuff that's being said -- unbelievable talent, smart, funny, quick, best character performer on the levels of Andy Daly and PFT.   She seems to be rising to fame quickly in the last year or two, and I wish her all the best, because frankly she is one of the best."
Earwolf,38wroz,Slayner,13,Sun Jun 7 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"Best performer affiliated with Earwolf at the moment (PFT is a close second). Is great on whatever podcast she is on, and With Special Guest has become one of the top podcasts on the network."

Earwolf,38vbil,ozymandiane,4,Sun Jun 7 03:37:58 2015 UTC,"It could have been tighter. Michael Cera is in the movie, and it wasn't necessary. There were a few other characters that were also introduced, had lines/scenes that could have been left on the floor of the editing room.  Still it was enjoyable, Matt Walsh kicks ass, David Koechner steals every scene he is in. I wouldn't mind seeing more from little Davey Cross, so long as he allows somebody else a pass at the editing."

Earwolf,38sg4u,nohorseman,5,Sat Jun 6 12:50:12 2015 UTC,"The lineup looks rad! (linking for us normies) Some great comedy there too it looks like.   Some deeper cuts that I happen to enjoy: Sturgill Simpson (who you've probably heard of, on i4h and living in TN), and Freddie Gibbs and Madlib!! I saw Freddie Gibbs for 5 bucks here in KY and he was wonderful, one of my favorite rappers. And his album with Madlib is so good.   I love Killer Mike too but I'm one of the few hip hop fans in the world who doesn't love RTJ.   EDIT: oo shit and fuckin D'angelo is there!!! What if he got on stage with K.Dot? OK I'm officially jealous  How was Husk + CYHSY + anniversary celebratish, /u/oshoney ? What did you all have to eat (if you can remember) and how dope was it?"
Earwolf,38sg4u,nohorseman,3,Sat Jun 6 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"If anyone wants to discuss, the comedy people are: Chris Hardwick, Reggie Watts, Jeff Ross, Ralphie May, Nick Thune, Natasha Leggero, Ron Funches, Ian Edwards, Ari Shaffir, Kurt Braunohler, Big Jay Oakerson, Dan Soder, Jamie Lee, Cameron Esposito, Matt McCarthy, Mark Normand, Michelle Wolf, April Richardson.  I'd love to see Natasha Leggero, Funches, and Ian Edwards. Jamie Lee was good on Whooch this week, too.  I can tell you from experience that the Reggie Watts thing on Netflix is lovely when frying, live would be unbelievable."
Earwolf,38sg4u,oshoney,3,Sat Jun 6 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"They're split up into different 'lineups' or whatever, but I'm definitely gonna try to do a Reggie Watts one and Kurt Braunohler/Cameron Espisito/Ron Funches one. It can be hard to get in there sometimes but I love seeing comedy at Roo.   I've seen a ton of awesome people in that comedy tent. Zach Galifianakis (with Reggie opening), Donald Glover, Aziz, Mike Birbiglia, Comedy Bang Bang (with Scott, Reggie, Weird Al, James Adomian as Jessie Ventura, and Thomas Lennon - wish that was a podcast but it was more like a comedy theatre piece. It was weird), John Waters, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, John Oliver... And that's just what I can remember off the top of my head."
Earwolf,38sg4u,oshoney,3,Sat Jun 6 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you like Killer Mike and rap in general but don't love RTJ. I cannot wait for that show. I'm gonna try to make it to Freddie & Madlib too for sure.   And it was great all around! For starters at Husk I had cheerwine glazed belly ham sliders and they were one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. For dinner, they had another belly pork thing but I didn't wanna have such a similar thing to my app so I had the catfish. Which was still delicious but I wish I had gotten more of that sweet sweet pork belly.   The show was super fun, we were front row for it. It was so high energy and everyone was dancing like crazy. I recommend seeing this tour if you love that album. So great."
Earwolf,38sg4u,nohorseman,3,Sat Jun 6 17:05:54 2015 UTC,"I guess it's El P I don't like. The beats are all very old school sounding and I have trouble getting into them. Killer Mike's solo stuff and stuff with Outkast is amazing though. Particularly Swimming with Flying Lotus producing, Still High, and all of Pledge Allegiance to the Grind pt 2. Killer Mike was the first hip hop show I ever saw though, I had never heard of him at the time, and goddamn is he amazing.   And damn that meal sounds magical. I love Cheerwine when I can get it and pork belly is scrumptious. What a clever thing to use at a Southern fine dining restaurant. Is your S.O. going to Bonnaroo with you?"
Earwolf,38sg4u,oshoney,3,Sat Jun 6 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Damn, I love el-p, so they are like the perfect combination for me.   And we'll both be there but aren't camping together. We both already had plans in place before we started dating so we're sticking to those. Probably for the best since I like having a small, manageable group at Roo. We're 5 deep, but they have like a dozen haha. No thanks. Plus they're all gonna be smoking like crazy and on our side only one or two of us will even partake, we're more alcohol than weed based. Still gonna see as many shows together as possible."
Earwolf,38sg4u,oshoney,3,Sat Jun 6 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'm going to FYF this year, so hyped for RTJ. I caught some of their set last year, and they are fantastic live."
Earwolf,38sg4u,oshoney,3,Sat Jun 6 23:20:31 2015 UTC,I'm seriously considering coming out to LA for FYF. Such a good lineup.
Earwolf,38sg4u,nohorseman,2,Sat Jun 6 23:23:33 2015 UTC,Doooo ittttt. Who would you want to see most?
Earwolf,38sg4u,nicemaker,3,Sat Jun 6 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"Frank Ocean, JaMC, Morrissey, RTJ, Deerhunter, D'Angelo, FKA Twigs, Spiritualized, Dino Jr... Too many to mention!   And other than Spiritualized and Deerhunter I haven't seen any of those which is rare in a festival lineup for me lately haha."
Earwolf,38sg4u,oshoney,2,Sun Jun 7 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"JaMC are awesome! They were fighting with each other the whole time and I couldn't tell if it was an act and the singer broke two different mic stands. So much tension, and the music sounded amazing.  When I saw Dino Jr. they were a little dull actually despite my loving their music. They just kind of stood there and looked bored.  That's an insane lineup though"
Earwolf,38sg4u,nicemaker,3,Sun Jun 7 05:39:50 2015 UTC,"The only music festival I've been to was Warped Tour when I was 17. What's bonaroo all about? Is it more than one day, where do you sleep at? Do you have to bring all your own food or do you buy it from vendors while you're there?"
Earwolf,38sg4u,CrouchJr,3,Sat Jun 6 13:07:49 2015 UTC,"Bonnaroo is a behemoth. It's 4 days and you camp on site (in the middle of nowhere, Tennesseee). On Friday & Saturday the music runs noon-4am (or later). I bring my own food for the campsite but I'll usually buy at least one meal from a vendor each day. It's a ton of fun but also a huge undertaking. But I don't even question it now, I go every year no matter if the lineup is great or not. I mean I live an hour down the road so it would have to be a lineup filled with Beibers for me not to go."

But all that said, if you guys think you don't need the help, I understand so I'll be happy just continuing to obsessively post here too."
Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,7,Fri Jun 5 15:51:52 2015 UTC,"After that Pauly Shore debacle, I would say you're ehhhh wrong about loving Earwolf and doing a good job."
Earwolf,38oi67,mitchwinner,10,Fri Jun 5 22:23:38 2015 UTC,"I've heard of Slayer's Metal content, but /u/Slayner moderating content!?"
Earwolf,38oi67,nicemaker,37,Sat Jun 6 00:19:56 2015 UTC,"You know what I just thought of with the Harris memorial thread? Instead of having it stickied we could put it on the sidebar.   Harris was a beloved earwolf guest and host of analyze phish, he deserves to be loved and remembered so rather than having the post stickied up front we could put it into the sidebar. That way it's still honored and not forgotten but it's also not smack in your face every time we come to the subreddit."
Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,16,Fri Jun 5 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"Great option.  I'd hate to see it get lost, but it is a huge bummer to see it at the top of the page every visit."
Earwolf,38oi67,siriusthinking,8,Fri Jun 5 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think it's time to move the sticky, but the sidebar is a nice place for it for a while."
Earwolf,38oi67,gladvillain,5,Fri Jun 5 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe they should permanently have the ""I just think.....motherfuckers wanna laugh"" quote in the sidebar? A nice, subtle way of Honoring Harris. Or maybe something to do with a guide through the cosmos?"
Earwolf,38oi67,Catvoca,10,Fri Jun 5 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"I would love to add a new mod sometime soon to help out when real life is getting too hectic; I still have a list of things I need to fix on here. After the weekend(I am getting married so..I am not gonna be around tomorrow. haha.), I will get in touch with everyone who has offered to be a mod and start adding new people to the crew here. Thanks to everyone for being patient and wonderful."
Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,5,Fri Jun 5 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"No worries man, none of us were really complaining, I think we all agree that this is a pretty great sub.   And it definitely sounds like you got more important stuff to worry about. So congratulations on that!"
Earwolf,38oi67,Pluppets,5,Fri Jun 5 21:10:49 2015 UTC,Hey congrats!! Don't sweat it.
Earwolf,38oi67,Ed_Sullivision,5,Fri Jun 5 21:04:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you, for keeping this place awesome. And congratulations!"
Earwolf,38oi67,Ed_Sullivision,2,Fri Jun 5 21:32:48 2015 UTC,Congrats my man!
Earwolf,38oi67,pdxsean,9,Sat Jun 6 23:26:42 2015 UTC,"Agree with the Harris thread.  Honestly the biggest change I'd like to see made is flair freedom. I don't know why the mods have been dragging their feet on this because it gets suggested in every ""Flair Request"" thread. There's so many Earwolf in-jokes that it just makes much more sense for us to be able to create our own flairs.   Other than that this really is a great subreddit. Everyone is very welcoming and positive. And we all know how quickly shit can sour on reddit. /r/harmontown is downright toxic compared to /r/earwolf."
Earwolf,38oi67,tkdgns,2,Fri Jun 5 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"/r/maximumfun is decent, as the hosts stop by (but I absolutely prefer Earwolf content by a million)."
Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,3,Fri Jun 5 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"Second for MaxFun - I love their content as well, although it takes some getting used to. It's a lot more laid back than the Earwolf standards. /u/jessethorn and other hosts are frequent contributors.  Just wanted to bump their stuff, they need more listeners!"
Earwolf,38oi67,Pluppets,3,Sat Jun 6 07:29:19 2015 UTC,"Third for maxfun. Lots of great podcasts, and for my money, Bullseye with /u/JesseThorn is one of the best shows on NPR. Seriously, people, check it out!"
Earwolf,38oi67,Pluppets,17,Sat Jun 6 17:14:05 2015 UTC,"Also, if/when we get a new theme for this sub, the upvotes should be cakes and the downvotes should be pies.  Edit: mustard and pants is better."
Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,18,Fri Jun 5 16:40:34 2015 UTC,Upvote should be muztard and downvote should be pants... or the other way around
Earwolf,38oi67,Pluppets,4,Fri Jun 5 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"Or downvote can be ""Tsk! Tsk!"" And upvote can be ""Attaboy!"""
Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,4,Fri Jun 5 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"Too many good ideas! That one might be better since it's from the TV show instead of CDR radio lol.   Ooooh! Wait, it can still be a picture of mustard and pants but with text that says tsk tsk and atta boy"
Earwolf,38oi67,Pluppets,8,Fri Jun 5 16:47:32 2015 UTC,Truly the best of both worlds. Now this subreddit ... is starting to look more like a mans grave.

Earwolf,38oi67,tkdgns,4,Sun Jun 7 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should use mustard and pants, since the whole point is that you don't know which is positive and which negative."
Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,7,Fri Jun 5 16:59:15 2015 UTC,Actually I'd have to do some digging by WAAAAAAAY back the first time they ever did it Scott did say which one was right or wrong. But then it became more of a bit or he forgot which one is negative or positive. Either way I get your point
Earwolf,38oi67,Home-Baked,6,Fri Jun 5 17:04:32 2015 UTC,What would be amazing is if we could somehow figure out a way to make a mustard or pants picture get randomly assigned whether you click upvote or downvote.
Earwolf,38oi67,autowikiabot,3,Fri Jun 5 17:08:26 2015 UTC,Ah that'd be the best! I'm sure there are some tech nerds around here that could figure it out

Earwolf,38oi67,Catvoca,7,Sat Jun 6 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"More meta stuff I just thought of: we should also make an FAQ possibly to help folks with iOS and Android get and listen to podcasts (point people to which apps get chatter on the boards). I've noticed a fair amount of threads on technical stuff that truthfully aren't annoying or anything, but it would be nice to have a resource to point people to so everyone gets high quality info.  and I also just realized there is post flair we should consider encouraging more.   EDIT: Here's a thread to potentially address people having technical problems, that could be collated and formalized if it gets a good response"
Earwolf,38oi67,notalek,21,Fri Jun 5 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"I was about to make the same post about the Harris sticky. I mean, its been 3 months already.... it's still very sad but it's time for the sub to move on. Not trying to sound harsh, I just think its kinda wrong at this point. We should be sticky-ing the freetalk saturdays at this point. Lets celebrate life instead.  As for the mods, I cant say I have even seen them do anything on this sub. I mean that might mean that they are actually doing an amazing job since, like you said, very few problems if any ever arise here. But id love for an additional that can get more community involvements going (like an thread every week for the cbbtv episodes)  Edit: its also about time we make use of this amazing subreddit theme:   https://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/22vcsg/hey_guys_i_made_an_earwolf_subreddit_theme_based/?ref=search_posts"

Earwolf,38oi67,CakeBoss16,10,Fri Jun 5 23:50:52 2015 UTC,I second /u/slayner for mod. He is so active on this community. He created and maintains the slack chat and the Hollywood handbook sub. He seems like a good guy so I would totally back it. Also I think the Harris sticky should be unstickied. It is somewhat if a bummer coming each time to this earwolf sub. Couldn't we just put it on the sidebar?

Earwolf,38oi67,Slayner,3,Fri Jun 5 23:09:19 2015 UTC,I'm on the other side of the world and would be keen to join the mod team if deemed useful. It's the middle of my afternoon when most Earwolf stuff gets released so I'm at a good time to help.  One of the most frustrating things that ever happened on this sub is when Farts and Pro 4 (presumably) got stuck in the mod queue with no-one to release it

Mostly, but I find people are unfortunately downvoted if they don't like this week's CBB guest or episode.

Earwolf,38piuu,wikais,4,Sat Jun 6 07:53:22 2015 UTC,Started watching from the first minute and 22 hours in the enthusiasm is absolutely drained from Pally to the point he's going home. This will be a lot of fun
Earwolf,38piuu,Doesntgetredditatall,3,Sat Jun 6 11:24:22 2015 UTC,"Can someone just give me a straight answer. Is entourage actually good? Or is it so bad that everyone makes fun of it?   I can never tell if Scott and other people like the show and just make fun of it, or if they think it's dumb and that's why they make fun of it."
Earwolf,38piuu,Slayner,6,Fri Jun 5 19:36:39 2015 UTC,"There's glitz and glamour and lots of stars!  But seriously, it's a low stress show, with a bunch of guys who seem to have developed some strong on-screen chemistry over the years.  Jeremy Piven is fantastic.  The world they've created is just fun to immerse yourself into for 20-ish minutes at a time.  It's not all great... many times, the show is pretty shallow.  As the show progressed (particularly at liek season 5 and on), it just became more of a chore to watch, as it became somewhat repetitive and way too over the top and dark-ish (coke benders!  suicides!  Avion tequila!).  Ultimately, I enjoy the first few seasons enough to revisit them regularly.  It's generally feel good fluff, but it's definitely not for everyone I guess."
Earwolf,38piuu,TheandreGreyjordan,2,Fri Jun 5 20:04:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I've just never watched it so I wasn't sure. The entourage recaps make it sound like nothing ever happened lol."
Earwolf,38piuu,Slayner,3,Fri Jun 5 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"It tows the line between being entertaining because it's bad and being entertaining because it's good. It's shallow and stupid at times, but can still be heartfelt and genuinely funny. And there is lots of nudity and celebrity guests.   When I saw the trailer for the movie, my first instinct was ""that looks like it's going to be a train wreck that I really want to see""."
Earwolf,38piuu,Circumv_ent,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:44:33 2015 UTC,"This is a great summary. For a show I pretty much hate 99% of the time, Ari defending his wife to Adam Davies is one of my favorite standalone TV scenes ever.

None of these probably apply much to Earwolf although that guy was bummed that Womp It Up wasn't on Stitcher. Plus /r/podcasts is trash. But maybe it's overkill I dunno. I had to use the first one to get Pistol Shrimps Radio when it first started though  Help! The podcast I want to subscribe to on my dedicated podcast app isn't showing up when I search for it!  This might happen if you want to add an obscure or brand new podcast. Most apps likely have a feature (probably under Advanced Settings or something, dig around) where you can add a feed by just entering its RSS URL. RSS is an online document that when properly parsed, indicates to the consumer that something has been updated. This is what iTunes or podcast apps query so that when a new episode is added, it shows up to you, the potential listener.  Help! I'm on Android and I can only find the iTunes page, no apparent RSS link!  Be cool, my friend. iTunes podcast pages have underlying RSS feeds that run them. Just copy/paste the iTunes link into Feed Flipper (recommended) or Podcast URL Extractor  and it will give you the non-iTunes RSS link you can use on your service."

Occasionally I'll scroll through the earwolf site for old eps, but then ill usually find them in pocketcasts to listen to in case I want to easily switch from desktop to mobile.   You have to pay for the browser version of pocketcasts separately from the cost of the mobile app, but its not that much in the long term. Especially considering how i am constantly using it."
Earwolf,38ow6e,1slinkydink1,9,Fri Jun 5 18:02:30 2015 UTC,I find the default iOS podcast app meets my needs. I listen to everything at 2x so I don't really benefit from any smart speed stuff. Free is very attractive to me.

Earwolf,38ow6e,Ciandotmov,2,Fri Jun 5 22:11:26 2015 UTC,You get used to it very quickly. Eventually it gets to a point where if you changed to normal speed it all seems in slow motion.   I should add I listen in 1.5 most of the time.
Earwolf,38ow6e,1slinkydink1,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:48:08 2015 UTC,Yup. I listened at 1.5 for a few months before I decided to step it up. It's not for everyone but I can't go back.
Earwolf,38ow6e,Slayner,3,Sat Jun 6 03:53:40 2015 UTC,It works fine for me as well. I don't understand why it's so hated. More features are always nice but 'hot garbage' implies something is very wrong with it. Does it just crash a bunch for everyone else?
Earwolf,38ow6e,CakeBoss16,2,Fri Jun 5 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"yeah good point, I updated it. I don't even have an iOS anything, I dunno"
Earwolf,38ow6e,Slayner,2,Fri Jun 5 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"I don't blame you for thinking that then, because people complain about it a lot. I pile on Apple when they mess something up but this one I just don't get"
Earwolf,38ow6e,CakeBoss16,5,Fri Jun 5 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"Two ways.   On to the go/new podcasts I use pocketcasts on an android phone.   However if I'm feeling like re-listening to something while I'm at home by my desktop I just go to the Web page the podcast is on and listen via SoundCloud.   I make sure to always use pocketcasts when I listen to a new one though, not only to subscribe, but to have my listening history updated."
Earwolf,38ow6e,jwalterleavesnotes,3,Fri Jun 5 17:07:17 2015 UTC,Pocketcast has a web version for the app as well. It's 9 bucks thou and does not have the same features as the android app.

Earwolf,38ow6e,jwalterleavesnotes,3,Fri Jun 5 18:36:31 2015 UTC,I bought it to support the development but to be honest it's not really worth it at the moment. It is lacking a bunch if features. It is cool that you can listen on your phone and pick it up at your pc thou with the syncing feature.
Earwolf,38ow6e,ThorManhammer,2,Fri Jun 5 18:59:55 2015 UTC,"Relevant comment from /u/CakeBoss16, pasting here to consolidate:   Pocketcast is the best with beyond pod coming in second. Pocketcast has a great ui with the ability to stream podcasts. The ability to boost volume, skip silence, and increase variable playback on local media. Most free podcast apps are really not worth the hassle due to it missing key features, bad ui, or some restriction too pay for a pro version. Good podcatchers are worth ever penny if you use them often."
Earwolf,38ow6e,CakeBoss16,5,Fri Jun 5 17:59:48 2015 UTC,"On iOS. I use Overcast. It's the best. Gorgeous design, awesome features (voice boost and smart speed), plus it has an online version where you can pick up where you left off on your computer. Just amazing."

And it looks like it'll set you back $3 US  I first heard about it on Lifehacker.  Lots of folks around here rave about Pocket Casts and it's beautiful design. So I tried it out yesterday and it does look great.   However it doesn't have my ultra controlling nerd shit. DoggCatcher has Global settings that are by default applied to all of your feeds, such as how many episodes you want downloaded and Wi-fi only, etc. You don't have to go in and edit them all by hand (which I believe you have to do on Pocket Casts).  My favorite thing, that I didn't realize was even a big deal, is in the following scenario. It is very re-listener friendly. We are currently involved with a re-listen over on /r/HollywoodHandbook , so I want to have a number of eps on hand. I can go into my HH feed and set it to download when I'm at home the 5 oldest unlistened-to episodes. So I always have 5 eps from the bottom on hand, ready for me to take painstaking notes on.   Pocket Casts does have some cool features like start or stop particular feeds at certain second intervals, so you can remove the ""Wolf Dead"" tag from Earwolf shows, etc. This isn't present on Doggcatcher.  It also doesn't keep the (often terrifying) listening statistics. Although it does use the Google Play player, which can scrobble to Last.fm, for a poor, rigged approximation of this feature.  I use the damn thing a whole bunch so if you have any relevant questions hmu papa  EDIT: Another cool thing, that I don't know if it's available elsewhere, is the ""Virtual Feed"" functionality. If you download, say, the CBB live eps, or a DLM premium ep, or I guess even an audio book, you can pick a folder off you phone and set it as a ""virtual feed."" It shows up on the grid with all your podcast RSS feeds, with the title of your folder, and you can play them with the skip forward/backward, variable speed, remembering where-you-are & done/new functionality you're used to in a podcast player. Holler if this is possible in other apps"
Earwolf,38ow6e,Thirteenfortyeight,3,Fri Jun 5 17:16:20 2015 UTC,Yeah nearly all podcast app have this functionality. You just need to have a file manager (I use cabinet beta or es file manager). Move said premium episode to custom episode location and the app should pick it up. For audiobooks you can do it but I suggest the app listen audiobooks player. Also the podcast app that gives you most control is beyondpod. If you find the hidden menu you can really customize it. I prefer pocketcast because I am a simple man but beyondpod has so much features. But at its current price I don't know if it's worth it. I bought beyondpod and thought I could use it and after going through all the gestures features I just ended up using it like pocketcast.
Earwolf,38ow6e,notalek,4,Fri Jun 5 19:39:09 2015 UTC,Well for android their are two podcast apps. Pocketcast for most people due it awesome ui and great listening features. And beyondpod which allows near granular control over your listening experience. The only problem with beyondpod is its ui is a mess and people have to basically get use to it. Pocketcast you get right off the back. I own ever single android podcast app so ask a question on it. Also FYI the play store has a return period so make sure to download it and if you don't like it just return it. Also great write up!
Earwolf,38ow6e,summahdaze,3,Fri Jun 5 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"When is an example of when you'd use the Reduce Silence or Boost Volume feature of Pocket Casts?  I think most paid apps have a variable speed feature. I use it on 1.2x during your informative NPR-type podcasts where comic timing isn't necessary for enjoyment, and will bump stuff up to 1.1x if it's a comedic interview-style pod and I get a little bored  I wish I could put CBB and HH on .9x though, really savor that sweet, sweet content"
Earwolf,38ow6e,POZZD,3,Fri Jun 5 18:13:04 2015 UTC,I use the reduce silence on all podcast and I don't feel it detracts from the listening experience. And variable speed is nothing new but remove silence is defiantly a killer feature on android. No other android app has it. I know some iOS apps have it thou.
Earwolf,38ow6e,siriusthinking,5,Fri Jun 5 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"RSS feeds fed into Feedly drawers, into Beyondpod."
Earwolf,38ow6e,AgentMullWork,2,Fri Jun 5 18:25:48 2015 UTC,So you use Feedly to categorize them basically? Like 'Comedy' 'Learning' 'Interview' ?
Earwolf,38ow6e,ajcfood,3,Fri Jun 5 18:28:48 2015 UTC,Exactly. it's so much easier to set the categories on a computer than on the app.
Earwolf,38ow6e,FeaturingPitbull,2,Fri Jun 5 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"Good ideal! My preferred app and I imagine most others have a Categories function but it's a real pain to do on a touch screen, like you said, so I don't touch it.  Happy cakeday!"
Earwolf,38ow6e,FeaturingPitbull,2,Fri Jun 5 18:38:34 2015 UTC,Thanks. Enjoy your podcasts! (seek out Chris Gethard's show)
Earwolf,38ow6e,Ciandotmov,3,Fri Jun 5 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"Downcast is by far the best (for me). Well, at least it was when I chose it many years ago. Unless the default iOS podcast app has drastically changed, it's total crap. I've heard great things about Overcast, and even considered switching but I'm pretty damn happy with Downcast."

Earwolf,38ow6e,Pluppets,3,Fri Jun 5 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"Android - Pocket Casts is amazing, and the developers team is super responsive if you have any issues.  I'll also listen to some on my TV through my Roku because technology.  I use the iTunes Podcasts app, not sure if there are any others."
Earwolf,38ow6e,sleepsholymountain,3,Fri Jun 5 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"I use Podkicker Pro. Its just the first one I started with, but everything else I've tried seems needlessly more complicated. One screen shows you all your subscriptions. One screen shows you all of the available episodes for all your subscriptions. One screen shows you which eps you've downloaded sorted by download date and acts as a playlist.   I really liked Pocketcast's UI. Much much prettier than Podkicker, but much more of a pita to use. For instance the downloaded page only shows them by release date, not when I downloaded them. I have to search through a grid of icons to find which show I want to look at (hope you didn't forget what that podcasts logo was). There is no master list of episodes across all your subscriptions (episodes disappear from the ""unplayed"" list which is the closest thing).    I would love a version of Podkicker with all the special features of Pocketcasts, like sync."

Earwolf,38ow6e,ItsScriabinAwhile,3,Tue Jun 9 16:15:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a Windows Phone user.  Pocket Casts is the one I use now. Its functionality is the best I've experienced so far on a WP and I love podcasts enough to not really mind the $3.99 price. It has a very clean interface, the skip forward / back buttons are customizable, and it can sync with an account if you want. It also lets you view the entire episode description which is frustratingly lacking in most podcast apps I've come across. The only downside I've come across with the app so far is that it crashes on startup more often than I'd like. But to be honest, with Windows Phones you generally have low expectations for apps and I think Pocket Casts is a winner all around :)  I used the Casts app (Free) for a long while but it was really frustrating. The skip functions did not work when my phone was locked and every few weeks the app would just delete all of my podcasts and downloaded episodes.  The official WP podcast app (Free) is reliable but pretty jumpy if you navigate quickly around the interface. However, it was often my backup for when Casts was being fickle.   Podcast Lounge ($2.99) is really good from what I've heard - it is comparable to Pocket Casts in that it costs money but it gets consistent support and it has really nice functionality."
Earwolf,38ow6e,beeinyourbonnet,2,Fri Jun 5 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"Cool, I doubt there are many Windows Phone users so I'm just making your word law up there"

Earwolf,38ow6e,GeorgeTaylorG,3,Fri Jun 5 21:45:53 2015 UTC,I use Downcast but it's been very slow for me lately so I have a question about other podcast apps. When I'm catching up on podcasts I normally listen to 3/4 series at once and I listen to them in the order they were released in. So for example in my current relisten I'm on May 2013. So in downcast I click on Downloaded and all my podcast episodes (doesn't matter the series) are sorted by date. That means I listen to the one at the top.  In past experience podcast episodes were always sorted by the actual podcasts. Has this changed in most other apps?

It sounds like you should be using the Playlist feature of Downcasts. You can choose which podcasts to show, how to order them and whether to group them by podcast or not."
Earwolf,38ow6e,Ratheronfire,2,Sat Jun 6 08:35:51 2015 UTC,I feel like I may be one of the only ones but: I mainly just use the earwolf website to stream. Its convenient enough and im usually playing a game or on the computer when I listen anyway. Only time I've downloaded some episodes on my phone is when I took a road trip to cape cod last winter.
Earwolf,38ow6e,KyleCrusoe,2,Fri Jun 5 17:20:57 2015 UTC,I have never had any problems at all with the iOS Podcast app and I'm not sure what people's beeves are with it. Back when I had an Android I used Stitcher and that I had way more problems with that.

Earwolf,38o3js,CrouchJr,15,Fri Jun 5 13:51:58 2015 UTC,"Saw him a year or so ago in Columbus, OH.  Dude was on point, very loose, riffing and working the crowd a lot.  The show was in a bar with a large back room, so the crowd was into the casual feel of his show.  The crazy thing was that this one girl, who of course sat front and center, decided to get slammered and shout nonsense through the sets of the openers.  Once Eric got on stage he immediately went at her, working her over pretty good.  She was kinda too drunk to get that people wanted her to quiet down and eventually she got tossed.  Then she got back in, got on stage, threw her drink at Eric and had to be physically removed from the show and apparently bit the guy carrying her out.  10/10."
Earwolf,38o3js,PugilistAtRest,6,Fri Jun 5 15:01:31 2015 UTC,"I've seen him twice. Once at Festival Supreme and once (last week, actually) at this show called Seven Minutes In Purgatory where the comedians perform stand up to a camera in another room with sound proof headphones on so they can't hear how the crowd is reacting. Both times were spectacular. At the Seven Minutes in Purgatory show, he whipped out his penis and started peeing on the roof that he was on. I heard he got naked at the other two shows he did that night. Go see him."
Earwolf,38o3js,RedFrogMario,4,Fri Jun 5 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"I saw him in Chicago at the hideout (a small room) a few years ago. It was actually the Eric Andre Show live, but probably similar. He started the show by running through the crowd (standing crowd) smashing a plant and getting dirt everywhere. Then he went on stage  and threw a big mac and fries into the audience. I got blasted by the patty and got secret sauce all over myself. It was a really crazy vibe. He had apparently hired local acts who didn't know about him to perform as ""guests"" on the show. One guy was a juggler who while on stage juggling the music slowly changed to a hitler speech. He also alluded to the fact that he had hired a michael jackson impersonator but the guy found out it was a prank and bailed. Then toward the end he got everyone in the crowd to go on stage with him, like literally as many people that could fit on stage squashed onto the stage. It was pretty coool"

Howard had some really great material and brought his A+ crowdwork game. Summah gum and what seemed like a million beach balls were tossed into the audience, while he lead cheers of ""F WINTAH!"".  The music performance section of the show stood out as particularly spectacular. Somewhat because every other time I've seen him (try to) perform music live, it's either been a complete disaster or he's second guessed himself into failure. This was the most confident I've seen him. In the past, when he actually does perform a song, it'll be a very short version of it. This time, they were shorter than the album versions, but they were much more than what he usually does.  The Gu Cruise video was perfect. It even opens with a subtle homage to Harris Wittels. After the show, I spoke to Howard, who told me that he still hasn't seen it and had gone back stage during the screening. So while more confident than ever, he's still struggling with being self conscious or whatever.  I was wearing my Summah Summit teespring shirt that had arrived just in time for the show. I didn't see any others at the show. I've got quite the Howard shirt collection (I'm the guy with all the shirts, from SF, he mentions in the Who Charted ads). He was wearing several Summah related shirts I had never seen for sale before (Jaws is Better, outlined version of Gu Cruise, and a few others) and mentioned the ""Have a Summah"" shirt he wore in the Gu Cruise video because I'd never seen one like it before. He ran back stage to grab the SHIRT FROM THE VIDEO AND GAVE IT TO ME!  Fucking awesome night."

Earwolf,38j3jm,mgh245,10,Fri Jun 5 04:32:19 2015 UTC,"I did and had a great time! They did a great intro about the terrible Winteh of 2014/2015, played some great songs with some very funny technical errors, and had three stand ups perform (unfortunately, I can't remember any of their names). Howard did a lot of great crowd interaction like having people kill winteh beasts and threw a ton of gum into the audience to encourage us to do a bubble blowing contest. 2/3 of the comedians didn't have the best set but I blame this on a red flashing cop light that they used for the very first song and then left on for the entire show for some reason; it distracted me, it probably distracted others, but that's my only complaint.   If you want any other specifics, I'll be happy to answer questions."

Earwolf,38hm0w,cameronxylo,-8,Fri Jun 5 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"Agree. Benny Schwartz in general is way too self-indulgent, making the episodes boring. Especially the solo ones. Same with the episode where Lauren Lapkus and Andy Samberg sing that song again and again. Boring as piss.  In fact, I think the whole podcast has gone that way. I tuned in for the first time in a long time the other day, barrage of words that sound like other words, riffing on every other word spoken, references to anything and everything."
Earwolf,38hm0w,Riverboat_Gambler,7,Thu Jun 4 21:17:24 2015 UTC,Sounds like you just don't like the comedy presented in CBB in general. Riffing on every other word spoken has always been like 90% of the humor. Terrorist Wittels being the champ in that regard.
Earwolf,38hm0w,october23sp,2,Fri Jun 5 01:56:07 2015 UTC,"You're right of course, but it wasn't always that way with CBB. Before Porks and Fuckreation and the bit-saturation style took off, the show was often more of a slow burn that would unexpectedly lead to utter insanity by the end. It was more casually conversational with the first guest (co-host), and Scott and the character guests used to bring more pre-planned stuff to the table (which obviously most of them don't have the time to do now). CBB's evolution over the years has been interesting; it still makes me laugh on a consistent basis, but the constant riffing does wear thin for me occasionally."
Earwolf,38hm0w,ajg1993,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:12:05 2015 UTC,"Only time it wears thin for me if Scott riffs and a guest (Tom Green example) isn't having it but Scott pushes for them to respond.

Earwolf,38ibi5,Slayner,10,Thu Jun 4 13:54:18 2015 UTC,Seriously. I loved when he read the definition of brother instead of brothel. So fugging quick man. He's top notch

Earwolf,38ibi5,turnk,2,Thu Jun 4 23:25:00 2015 UTC,"he is so quick it blows my mind! like he has the perfect, best responses ready almost before his scene partner finishes speaking while still obviously listening really well to what they're saying. How is that even possible?!"
Earwolf,38ibi5,katiebug88,8,Sat Jun 6 16:40:42 2015 UTC,I think it is time Earwolf changes Zach Woods' guest photo
Earwolf,38ibi5,NickCrowder,9,Thu Jun 4 14:09:16 2015 UTC,"I can't believe what has been going on with Eric the unpaid intern. It's crazy to me that since the time he first started appearing on the show AS AN INTERN, he got a job at multiple successful startups, got married, somehow became the CTO of some company, made a ton of money when the company was sold, and got divorced and lost a bunch of money."
Earwolf,38ibi5,hdlsa,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, it would be ridiculous for a regular person to go through that much in a short period of time... but this is Eric, a man who can't even say no to the most pathetic psychic asking for $25. He's really gone through a whirlwind, we're so lucky to have been able to be involved. Too bad we didn't hear the story about the wedding and divorce, I imagine that was some messed up stuff."
Earwolf,38ibi5,pdxsean,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:36:00 2015 UTC,He told the whole story the last time he was at a live show. Episode 163.

Earwolf,38ibi5,pdxsean,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"Sure, enjoy! It's a pretty weird story, and just further proof that Eric seems to be a really smart guy that just doesn't know how to interact with people."
Earwolf,38j4xj,mi-16evil,6,Thu Jun 4 15:48:12 2015 UTC,"I imagine other people like me don't like listening to the Black List Table Reads podcast week to week and instead like to binge listen to the whole script in one. So every 4 weeks I'll post all the episodes of the new table read to let everyone here know when to binge listen.  I thought this script was a lot better than Balls Out which I didn't find funny or interesting. This script hits some tough issues in it, but I think it was mostly successful. Definitely felt a little rough but the issues it covered were interesting."

Earwolf,38j4xj,theballsdeeper,7,Thu Jun 4 15:59:15 2015 UTC,A dark comedy called Terrible Parents. The cool part is Paul Scheer and June Diane Rapheal are playing the titular parents.

Earwolf,38hmw5,MeanLatifah,3,Thu Jun 4 17:20:24 2015 UTC,"It's worth checking out. Every episode is a different format, whatever Daly feels like doing. They do have a few recurring episode themes though like Building The Track, where he has a guest on and some musicians and they make a song together in like 20 minutes and they play the finished song at the end of the ep, they are really cool"
Earwolf,38hmw5,Memphish_Boognish,3,Thu Jun 4 17:26:58 2015 UTC,I have to keep pausing because every time Gil says something he's cracking my shit up. Everyone needs to listen to this.
Earwolf,38hmw5,SirRibShack,2,Thu Jun 4 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"That was some genius improv there, baiting the others to accuse him of being homeless, and then at the end everyone else admitting that they are homeless, especially Scharpling over the phone, was some top tier loffs."

Earwolf,38hmw5,oshoney,2,Thu Jun 4 20:06:28 2015 UTC,This is seriously one of the funniest episodes of any podcast I have heard this year. Absolutely hilarious from start to finish. I think this might be up there with my favorite episodes of ADPPP and CBB.
Earwolf,38hmw5,Ailite,2,Fri Jun 5 14:39:43 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, this was fantastic. I downloaded it as an ""eh, why not"" to listen to while I play some games, and it was non-stop hilarious."

Earwolf,38fful,TakeItToTheMax,12,Wed Jun 3 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"That's part of her character, just like Hiedecker comes on and plays up his personality"
Earwolf,38fful,Memphish_Boognish,3,Wed Jun 3 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"She's one of my favorite guests but something about it being a live episode made it feel... off. It wasn't just her, imo."
Earwolf,38fful,TvsPhil,2,Thu Jun 4 01:20:51 2015 UTC,I thought she was p good on that ep. The crowds at SXSW seemed pretty weak across all the pod eps I listened to there this year
Earwolf,38fful,nohorseman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"I don't remember necessarily having an issue with which characters were used, but just I personally haven't been a big fan of many of the live shows due to the dynamic change. The energy is different and as strange as this sounds, sometimes it gets too out there as they play to a live audience. That's just my deal.  That being said, I only listened to those SXSW episodes once and don't remember much about them."
Earwolf,38fful,TvsPhil,6,Thu Jun 4 04:19:27 2015 UTC,She certainly seemed less than enamored of Tom Leykis.

But I think it's good.   If you liked her on the Pod F. Tompkast, her own podcast is basically her telling those kind of stories."

Earwolf,38azeu,MikeyObviously,3,Wed Jun 3 01:44:24 2015 UTC,"Cyber Thug for me takes me to my university's dining hall, fourth table from the door in the back right corner of the room, facing away from the entrance to the dining hall, eating baked ziti at dinner alone because my girlfriend (now wife) had a class that conflicted and we couldn't eat dinner together that night.  I'll listen to past episodes of stuff (especially CBB and NNF) and know exactly what I was doing when I heard that episode. It's weird but it's weirdly really nice that I can go back in that amount of detail to a tiny snapshot of my life. I don't have a good memory, and the memories I do have tend to be vague, but when I hear a podcast I listened to years ago it transports me back to a vivid snapshot in time. I love it."

Earwolf,38azeu,robotbeard,2,Wed Jun 3 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"A while ago, I had job where I was in a backroom all and could listen to podcasts all day, so I started CCB and I4H from the beginning. Now when I relisten to old eps, I'm usually taken back to that dark and lonely backroom.  But now I deal with the public and can barely keep up with the new episodes. It's a double-edged sword."
Earwolf,38azeu,sleepsholymountain,2,Wed Jun 3 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"In early 2014 I was taking weekly walks a few blocks north to get lunch at this burger place. I always went on the day a new U Talking U2 To Me was released so I could listen on the way there and back. Now anytime I make that walk or I even drive by that stretch of road, I immediately get very vivid memories of listening to that podcast for the first time. Those were some very funny lunch walks.  On a somewhat similar note, after Harris died I decided to binge Analyze Phish from start to finish doing one or two episodes a night. I multitasked this listen-through while revisiting Mario 64 because I hadn't played that game in a long time. The experiences actually went together surprisingly well, and now I associate that video game with Harris Wittels and Phish, and vice versa."
Earwolf,38azeu,Ed_Sullivision,2,Wed Jun 3 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"Totally. It also helps me time stamp moments in podcasts. I listen a lot during my commute to and from work, so I can easily remember where and how far I was into my commute when something happened. Crazy how the brain works."
Earwolf,38azeu,jpatton89,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yep! I used to work a driving job that would automatically take an hour off my pay for lunch everyday. When I first started, I couldn't keep up with the work demand and I ended up working through lunch several days even though I wasn't getting paid. When it was getting close to quitting the job, I parked my vehicle in a Walmart parking lot and just relaxed and listened to podcasts all day for just one day...you know, make up some of the time I never got paid when I started the job. The Christopher Lloyd episode of the Nerdist Podcast always triggers the memory of that day. I specifically remember listening to that episode."
Earwolf,38azeu,btemplar,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:37:10 2015 UTC,Yep all the time. I listen to podcasts when I walk my dog and try and vary up our routes so when I re-listen to a certain section I'll be reminded of a street etc (Harris pushing over a penguin is forever linked to a certain spot of road where I used to live for example).
Earwolf,38azeu,PrinceWilliamShatner,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:40:27 2015 UTC,"YES. I came out of lurkerdom specifically to reply to this. I also listen almost exclusively while running (walking the dog, for some reason, gets NPR podcasts). We moved about two years ago--it was a job move that required us to leave a place we love, it was not asked for or wanted--and for the longest time I had a hard time listening to my old favorites because it just made me too sad. The ""Who Charted?"" theme song, for instance, would take me back to running down the hill we used to live on. Old CDR/CBB eps would take me to wherever I was when I first heard them (running on the side of the road near my kids' school, the trail next to Whole Foods, waiting at a light that was always slow to turn green...) I call ""U Talkin' U2 to Me?"" my anchor podcast because it was the first new thing I listened to after moving that I didn't associate with my old town. (It also helped lift me out of the depressive fog I'd been in since moving, but that's a different story.) When I start old eps at the beginning of a run from my driveway I can use it to gauge my time without looking at my watch because I remember exactly where I was the first time I heard certain jokes."
Earwolf,38azeu,simbajam13,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:41:04 2015 UTC,"Happens to me all the time. I'll listen to an old episode of Stop Podcasting Yourself and remember getting groceries in my college down or listen to an old Jordan Jesse Go! and remember my summer job in IT. It's bonkers, I really like it."

Earwolf,38cxcm,nohorseman,2,Thu Jun 4 14:01:40 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was just looking at the Pocket Casts thing.   What do you use?  Is there a way to see what things are available on it first before paying?  One of the issues I am having with the stitcher thing is it doesnt have everything. I had to move away from the itunes podcast app because of how it was working. it was maddening.   The other person on this thread mentioned some business practice issues with stitcher. It looked kind of shady so I am ready to switch. Thanks again for your help and input.
Earwolf,38cxcm,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Jun 4 14:13:00 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm on Android, ignore lots of my last post.

Earwolf,38a7e1,BretMichaelsWig,5,Wed Jun 3 17:38:36 2015 UTC,"Dead Author Podcast, Spontaneanation and the Pod F. Tompkast are the obvious choices.   Maybe my favorite CBB ep with Paul is the live show with Traci Reardon and JW Stillwater, but I also love the episode with Werner Herzog and Benny Schwaz. And you can never go wrong with Time Bobbies. ALW is one of my favorite PFT characters ever.  Pretty much every season of Super Ego features a ton of the big PFT as well, although the current season has him as an official member of the crew, so there's even more of him.  He's also great on a few episodes of The Andy Daly Podcast Pilot Project. The Dalton Wilcox episode, the Patty episode, and the Travel Bug episode all heavily feature our favorite mustached gentleman."
Earwolf,38a7e1,TheBlackSpank,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:00:35 2015 UTC,"I just listened to that Travel Bug episode for the first time yesterday. That was hilarious. PFT was great, Gourley was awesome as always. And I could hear some of Jean Claude Pepi come out of Daly through his German accent."

Dead Authors Podcast. Either pick some eps with your favourite comics or authors, hard to go wrong here.  If you have the episodes from the 2013 live tour, the Cake Boss and Don Dimello episode is incredible.  Finish it all off with PFT's most recent appearance on The Todd Glass show for out of character but still hilarious Paul."
Earwolf,38a7e1,Tavish_Degroot,3,Wed Jun 3 03:53:34 2015 UTC,I think he has great chemistry with the hosts of Stop Podcasting Yourself. He's been on a half-dozen times or so

His appearance on The Mental Illness Happy Hour, while not a comedy performance, is fascinating and moving. You'll come out of it feeling like you know him even better than you do now."
Earwolf,389yuj,cameronxylo,3,Tue Jun 2 21:12:28 2015 UTC,"It's no Citizen Kane, but it's an enjoyable movie. My favorite aspect of the movie is JB Smoove with a James Harden beard and haircut.

Some other recs - my favorite shows are Gravid Water (hard to get tickets for), John & Scott (also really popular 2prov), and The Stepfathers (Friday night). I've heard good things about Goat (Saturday), and the Harold Team Women & Men is amazing (Tuesdays). But most shows at UCB Chelsea are phenomenal.

Earwolf,38auez,Tavish_Degroot,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:55:36 2015 UTC,Never been to the NY locations but at the LA locations I always see people on standby get in.  Show up really early and get your name on the list right away. Then when people start lining up I always see people asking if anyone has extra tickets. Usually there's a few.  I think it's not uncommon for ticket holders to no show. Since tickets are usually only 5-10$ I've often bought 2 tickets for shows I want to go to before I know for sure if my girlfriend can get away from work/school for the show. This occasionally leaves me with an extra ticket and I imagine it happens to other people all the time.  I've even been to sold out shows that had empty seats.
Earwolf,38auez,86themayo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:00:01 2015 UTC,"I think you'll most likely get in, especially if you show up 30 minutes early, but you'll probably have to stand in the back. I've never actually been turned away from standby, but I know it does happen.  Also, like someone else said, the Seth Myers writers show is an improv show, and there are still tickets. It should be very good.  But Cage Match is definitely a fun and unique experience, so I'd recommend it. Also, they usually release a few more tickets on the day of the show, so maybe check the show page a few times throughout the day tomorrow."

Earwolf,387fxa,shadoire,2,Tue Jun 2 13:11:12 2015 UTC,Yeah. A 'Mother and Son' podcast would be pretty great.
Earwolf,387fxa,pdxsean,5,Fri Jun 5 02:31:46 2015 UTC,Episodes like this always make me blown away how people think David and Kyle hate each other. They seem like great friends.   Sucked that there was no tig but I thought it was a good episode
Earwolf,387fxa,pdxsean,2,Tue Jun 2 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"It's funny because I am one of those who say that, but I do agree that they got along very well on this episode. It's easily my favorite this year outside of the Kyle solo episode.  I think the tension between Dave and Kyle is evident in the three-way dynamic because basically Kyle serves as David's foil as Kyle plays to Tig. In this one-on-one style it's a lot easier to be professional and polite as there's no third party to impress.  At least that's my opinion. The point is, this is a great episode! I'm involved in running a poker room here in Portland so I really appreciated all the poker talk, and wasn't sure how well it would go over with the general public."
Earwolf,387fxa,pdxsean,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of poker, I wanted to hear more about it honestly. Do you gamble or just play? I always try to gamble but none of my friends are up to putting down real money.   Anyway. I kind of get what you mean in the threee way dynamic, but it's not so much that I think they don't get along, but more of David just gets frustrated trying to keep the show on track.   I'm very happy that he got his own SyFy show, hopefully that'll lead him to pursuing some real discussion rather than just nonstop jokes you know?   Idk, all in all, I feel like they're good friends, but Kyle and Tig offset David a bit. It's not too jarring like some make it out to be, but it is noticeable."
Earwolf,387fxa,Teenageboy69,2,Sat Jun 6 02:57:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wanted to hear more too, I've had plenty of people tell me about their adventures at the WSOP this year so it was cool to hear this celebrity add his side.  My organization has around 40 dealers and we deal at a local room here in Portland, mostly tournaments with $50-$250 buyins. Tomorrow for example there is a $200 buy-in ($500 after rebuy and addon) $30K Guaranteed Prize Pool tournaments we'll be dealing. The room has run $100K GTD in the past - that was a great day.   Most of us play as well, I'm pretty disciplined so I try to stick with less than $200 total tournaments. I played a few big dailies at the 2011 WSOP - 2800 runners in one of those - and have also done well over the years at the Venetian. Three or four times I've made final tables where first is >$5000 but my biggest cash sadly is only around $2K. I even have a Hendon Mob page!"

Earwolf,387fxa,shadoire,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:25:26 2015 UTC,"Portland is pretty great in a lot of ways, but our poker scene is really impressive. The laws are kind of weird in Oregon, it's lightly regulated and there's a wide variety of games from town to town. Here in Portland there is no rake for the house, only a flat daily fee. It's a crazy system and we're working to get the laws cleared up for everyone, but until then we've got a pretty good legal stopgap system in place."

There's actually a lot of long running stories include a very great relationship involving the host of the show.  Just remember, no dogs or people are allowed in the dog park. Ever."

Earwolf,381zx5,Quinez,20,Mon Jun 1 14:37:52 2015 UTC,"Reggie doesn't strike me as a great traditional freestyle rapper. He is amazing at everything else but his raps tend to devolve into just sentences and statements to the flow of the rap. Still a hell of a lot better than I could even do on the spot, however."
Earwolf,381zx5,Pluppets,17,Mon Jun 1 19:18:16 2015 UTC,Reggie doesn't tend to rhyme in his regular music. He goes for the surreal. Not all musicians can freestyle rap. The only person that can compete with Neil is the Poehlernator.
Earwolf,381zx5,TheBlackSpank,29,Tue Jun 2 01:33:10 2015 UTC,There is something very sweet about  Reggie getting a podcast sendoff so everyone knows there are no hard feelings. The Earwolf crew legitimately seem like good dudes.

Earwolf,381zx5,klobbermang,13,Mon Jun 1 14:59:10 2015 UTC,"Reggie was so wonderfully awful on the freestyle rap battle, I couldn't stop laughing. Love it."
Earwolf,381zx5,Slayner,19,Mon Jun 1 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"Scott was all: um, is that it?  Up the energy, bro!  And Reggie was all: nah bro, I'm good.  Reggie doesn't have the intense fear of rapping that every other comedian on CBB seems to have.  But he also hardly tries.  I swear I heard him yawn at one point."
Earwolf,381zx5,Quinez,14,Mon Jun 1 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"Loved the bumping death protocol.   And I have a sneaking suspicion that in lieu of a b-b-b-bonus ep, we get a big ol dose of UTU2TM"

Earwolf,381zx5,Trevent,16,Mon Jun 1 16:54:41 2015 UTC,"I was kind of bummed out about how upset and sentimental Scott is about Reggie leaving, yet Reggie admits that he probably won't even watch the final episode of him on the show."
Earwolf,381zx5,TomLeykis101,24,Mon Jun 1 15:24:44 2015 UTC,I'm pretending it's a bit
Earwolf,381zx5,slave_to_technology,10,Mon Jun 1 15:40:52 2015 UTC,"It's most certainly a bit! The perfect chance for Scott to create tension and make it awkward for Reggie to see what he can get out of him. And it would be pretty uncharacteristic of Reggie to show any genuine emotion, at least in this setting. I thought it sounded like they were having some good fun"
Earwolf,381zx5,shaky_but_nice,11,Mon Jun 1 19:38:15 2015 UTC,I don't know.  Scott said in an older episode that Reggie never watches the finished product.
Earwolf,381zx5,theloniousfunkd,13,Tue Jun 2 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know the interview portion of the show is almost never a serious interview, but it seemed like Scott was looking for genuine responses from Reggie, but Reggie wasn't taking it seriously.  Who knows though, sometimes with Scott you can't tell whether it's all a bit."
Earwolf,381zx5,Iron_de_Havilland,13,Mon Jun 1 16:18:32 2015 UTC,"I did wonder about some of the ""fake"" tension in this episode.  Scott acted hurt and betrayed on Doug Loves Movies after news of Reggie's departure first broke; maybe that was a bit too, but it's hard to tell.    Reggie coming in a little bit lazy and sloppy and then leaving early, Scott playing up being hurt and angry... I wouldn't be surprised if it's entirely a bit, but I also wouldn't be surprised if there was a little bit of emotion underlying it all."
Earwolf,381zx5,Quinez,17,Mon Jun 1 16:58:19 2015 UTC,"In the DLM ep, i got the sense that Scott was just sad that Reggie was leaving and also was not allowed to talk about it ans Kroll and Hamm just kept playing off that. It didnt come across as betrayal to me. But thats just how i took it"
Earwolf,381zx5,House_Of_Pies,3,Mon Jun 1 17:56:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't think he seemed hurt/betrayed at all, I took it as 100% he wasn't supposed to talk about it yet and then just played along w/ Hamm & Kroll"
Earwolf,381zx5,katiebug88,5,Tue Jun 2 19:44:05 2015 UTC,I think he admitted on another podcast that he was genuinely annoyed with Jon Hamm for bringing it up with no regard for whether or not Scott had already gotten the chance to announce it. Or something along those lines
Earwolf,381zx5,shaky_but_nice,2,Mon Jun 1 19:27:31 2015 UTC,Do you know which podcast/episode?
Earwolf,381zx5,ColonelSandersCult,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:11:23 2015 UTC,I think it was either his Never Not Funny Episode from January or the Nerdist ep he was on in February
Earwolf,381zx5,shaky_but_nice,2,Tue Jun 2 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"Must have been NNF, I never heard the Nerdist one."
Earwolf,381zx5,simbajam13,7,Tue Jun 2 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's just that what makes Reggie charming - his cool-as-a-cucumber attitude and apathy - can also frustrate people at times. Scott has said in interviews that he's really proud of what he's written for this upcoming episode, so it probably is a bummer to learn that Reggie hasn't even watched it. I don't think Scott was really upset or anything, but I'd wager that some of that annoyance was genuine, which is completely understandable."
Earwolf,381zx5,blahblahblahdkjdfgj,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:29:11 2015 UTC,When in doubt I always assume Scott is doing a bit.
Earwolf,381zx5,sleepsholymountain,10,Thu Jun 4 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"I find it odd (let me emphasize that this is my opinion) that the ""bandleader"" of the CBB TV show is not a very good CBB podcast guest. Reggie just doesnt gel (or cares to gel) with the podcast and it really shows. Even the Tears for Fears ep, he only ever perked up when Scott mentioned him playing with the band or Reggie's love for the band."
Earwolf,381zx5,requisite_monocle,5,Mon Jun 1 17:03:13 2015 UTC,Probably why they chose him for the TV show and he's not on the podcast that much

Earwolf,381zx5,peon_taking_credit,4,Mon Jun 1 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"Is this the first time Scott has ""died"" on the show?"
Earwolf,381zx5,RyanPumroy,13,Mon Jun 1 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he died in all the time bobbys, or at least presumed dead at the end of the ep"
Earwolf,381zx5,bigontheinside,13,Tue Jun 2 00:06:56 2015 UTC,He killed himself at the end of at least one Suicide House ep
Earwolf,381zx5,TorturouslyOkay,7,Tue Jun 2 01:06:38 2015 UTC,There was that long period of time between Oh Golly and Oh Golly 2 where they might have been dead? Or was that a dream? Or did they die as children? Or did they mysteriously make it out of the cliffhanger? I forget.
Earwolf,381zx5,goofy_ball,6,Tue Jun 2 06:29:34 2015 UTC,The guest lineups have been unbelievable the past couple of weeks!
Earwolf,381zx5,MeanLatifah,7,Mon Jun 1 07:36:52 2015 UTC,"Kind of a lackluster episode considering the circumstance. I would want a Reggie send off episode to be high energy, which this was not. A hype freestyle battle with legends like Brett Gehlman and/or Amy Poehler would have made that segment better, and PFT was desperately needed to make the ball droid segments better.    It felt like Reggie wasn't that into it and he left early, plus the episode wasn't that funny. I'm not complaining so much as disappointed that a Reggie send off wasn't better."
Earwolf,381zx5,shrapnade,3,Tue Jun 2 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the thing is if you listen to past episodes with Reggie he almost always remains silent the entire time another guest comes in. He's clearly not comfortable in that fast paced improv environment and who could blame him?  The tv show is another story, but Reggie's role was a defining aspect of the show and it will be hard to see him go. I'll watch the show regardless but most of my favorite moments in the history of the show included him."
Earwolf,381zx5,temporarychair,2,Wed Jun 3 03:53:16 2015 UTC,Hopefully the TV episode makes up for it on Friday.
Earwolf,381zx5,oshoney,4,Tue Jun 2 20:13:52 2015 UTC,Caution: Friday comes on Thursday this week.
Earwolf,3842ov,PureDarkness93,2,Mon Jun 1 18:31:43 2015 UTC,It could very well be. But since the CBB episode was recorded a few weeks back it seems like too much of a coincidence they released this video today.
Earwolf,3842ov,Ciandotmov,4,Mon Jun 1 22:42:29 2015 UTC,Yeah but in the description it says one afternoon. Could still be the same day and just a coincidence they both came out today.

Earwolf,381zxq,sevillianrites,20,Mon Jun 1 07:29:14 2015 UTC,This was a good 'un. And I have no problem chalking it mainly up to Gourley. That guy is a comedy force.  (That's not to take anything from the others)
Earwolf,381zxq,TvsPhil,17,Mon Jun 1 11:29:28 2015 UTC,And his constant dropping of Hamlet quotes and plot lines in the unrelated improv was fantastic.
Earwolf,381zxq,olenine,3,Mon Jun 1 19:27:44 2015 UTC,The line-up was top-notch and it definitely showed in the scene!
Earwolf,381zxq,requisite_monocle,3,Mon Jun 1 16:51:50 2015 UTC,This might  have been my favorite episode so far. And it was all because of Nolte
Earwolf,381zxq,lemonpjb,12,Tue Jun 2 15:25:43 2015 UTC,Great for Nick Nolte to stop by and chatting with the show

Earwolf,381zxq,nohorseman,5,Mon Jun 1 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"This was definitely a stronger episode than most overall and you have to give credit to the guests involved, Gourley, Burns, and Tallman. This show is ultimately driven by the likability of PFT and that's what brings me back again and again, but like all improv, it's often hit or miss. This was mostly a hit but I felt like Burns got (unintentionally) boxed out for most of it."
Earwolf,381zxq,temporarychair,4,Wed Jun 3 03:42:11 2015 UTC,That Nick Nolte impression is amazing.
Earwolf,381zxq,KingDongBundy,3,Wed Jun 3 16:48:55 2015 UTC,"This show feels like an Earwolf version of Superego --- and that's a GOOD thing. The world needs more Superego, in any form it cares to take."
Earwolf,381zxq,KingDongBundy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"I like that it's more focused. As much as I love Superego, it has a tendency to trail off into complete indecipherable nonsense. Which works for it usually, but can feel gimmicky. I like the linearity of Spont's nonsense as, even when there are weak moments, it's not difficult to pick the thread of the narrative back up and move on."

Earwolf,381zxq,satyagraaha,4,Mon Jun 1 11:23:35 2015 UTC,"I've started to skip the interviews. If it is a guest I'm particularly interested in I guess I'll listen to it, but it hasn't really been worth listening to most of the time. Does anyone else feel the same way? The improv is always C+ material though."
Earwolf,381zxq,satyagraaha,6,Mon Jun 1 17:39:09 2015 UTC,"Man I couldn't be further from you here. I don't really care for this sorta format and the premise was not something I was onboard with at all, but I am really loving this show. The last few have just been crazy funny to me. It seems to require a lot of attentiveness, as the eps build hard on themselves. But once you zero in, shit is great. Even the interviews I'm onboard with, if for no other reason than PFT is just so charming."
Earwolf,381zxq,sleepsholymountain,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:26:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love the improv and I like PFT on CBB, but his personality is a bit too much for me in such a heavy dose during the interviews, I guess. It feels fake in this context. Plus, the guests for the interviews have been so random and it just seems so detached from the improv, besides the location suggestion."
Earwolf,381zxq,TakeItToTheMax,6,Mon Jun 1 20:48:39 2015 UTC,"Opposite. I really like the interviews even when it's someone I don't especially care about like Jason Ritter, but I struggle a little bit with the improv. PFT is a good interviewer and a pretty engrossing conversationalist in general. He's obviously a good comedic improviser as well, but I don't think he has a lot of formal training in it, and sometimes it shows a little bit."
Earwolf,381zxq,satyagraaha,4,Mon Jun 1 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time with the podcast overall. Maybe it's because I typically am gaming or driving when I listen to it, but I can't seem to follow the improv that well. Maybe I'm just lazy and not attentive. Some of the episodes have been really great like the one with Kaitlyn Olson, but I'm a little let down by it. That makes me sad."
Earwolf,381zxq,nohorseman,3,Mon Jun 1 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, PFT also seems to force a lot of stuff like hes overexcited or something and his off-mic laughter seems to be forced sometimes."

Earwolf,37yeri,oshoney,3,Sun May 31 14:20:18 2015 UTC,His episodes talking about beastiality are among my favorite I4H and still keep those shows downloaded to my laptop.
Earwolf,37yeri,MadMan2012,3,Mon Jun 1 20:53:37 2015 UTC,His view makes sense in it's own weird way.
Earwolf,37yeri,istartriots,5,Sun May 31 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"Me too. He's a very funny guy, but he talked some absolute nonsense in that episode."
Earwolf,37yeri,Riverboat_Gambler,7,Sun May 31 23:03:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with him on the bestiality thing. And I think a lot of other people feel the same way he does, they just don't have the balls to actually defend it because they're afraid of being thought of as ""promoting"" bestiality. All he was saying is that if the animal enjoys it, how is it a bad thing? Maybe I'm a little biased because I fuck animals literally all day, but I don't really see how you can disagree with his point."
Earwolf,37yeri,traunks,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:20:20 2015 UTC,"But that's completely missing the point. The point is that they cannot consent to having sex, so you cannot assume they'll enjoy it and then retroactively say it was a good thing if they did. How is having sex with an unconscious woman a bad thing if she enjoys it when you tell her later? Same thing."
Earwolf,37yeri,Riverboat_Gambler,3,Mon Jun 1 09:37:43 2015 UTC,"You're imposing very rational human rules of consent on very irrational animals. They don't abide by the rules we set for ourselves in our society, they don't feel what we feel, at least not really. I leave my dog in a cage for a few hours when I go to work. I hate to see him in there, but I know that's just me projecting how I would feel if I were in a cage. He likes his cage for some primordial reason. Animals have a different set of emotional benchmarks and we shouldn't try and put our moral compass onto them.   Also, if an animal doesn't want you to have sex with it, it'll let you know. Dogs try to hump each other all the time and if they're not down with that, they bite and growl and bark. I think Gemberling made that point. It's not like dogs are brain dead and can't voice displeasure."
Earwolf,37yeri,Teenageboy69,3,Mon Jun 1 19:34:16 2015 UTC,As weird as that is. I respect his abiltiy to stand by his beliefs and actually defend them intelligently.
Earwolf,37yeri,Pluppets,10,Sun May 31 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"I was unfamiliar with Gemberling until Little Button Puss, at which point I started mainlining all of his I4H episodes. His one true love moment in that episode had me full on ugly crying with laughter."
Earwolf,37yeri,BronsonMagnifico,3,Sun May 31 15:06:07 2015 UTC,Definitely one of my favorite CBB moments. I don't think I've ever laughed that hard at an episode.
Earwolf,37yeri,Condawg,7,Sun May 31 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"Gemberling is a master of the slow burn. Little Button Puss has plenty of great moments but the best example I can think of is the i4h episode 113 where in one of the scenes he plays the titular (til I die) character ""Non-Descript Hole"". Everyone is totally in the moment and Matt says a sentence that isn't grammatically correct but makes sense and would usually just get plowed over, but Gemberling stops the conversation and shines a spotlight on it. He does this same thing on plenty of other episodes but this one is perfect and hilarious because of the voice he is using. He is one of few people I have heard that can stop a scene dead in its tracks to make a joke but still keeps it going somehow."
Earwolf,37yeri,hodgie,6,Mon Jun 1 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"""Who other better to know?"" I also loved the recent 420 episode where Matt asks Brett if he'll be okay to record while high and Gemberling goes ""Yeah will getting high affect your ability to have already pushed record?"""

Earwolf,37yeri,Condawg,2,Sun May 31 17:12:09 2015 UTC,there was a thread where a fan recounted an interaction with MC chris  saying he was flippant and kind of rude. Others chimed in.  It snowballed and a lot of people were recounting unpleasant encounters where dude came across as a jerk and pitchforks were brought out. Eventually other questionable stuff about him was brought to light.  It ended up with MC Chris making a video of himself crying about it and apologizing IIRC.
Earwolf,37yeri,istartriots,2,Sun May 31 20:06:56 2015 UTC,"That was such a strange event. I was really active on his fan forums back in the day (like a decade ago at this point...), so I had tons of great interactions with him online and at concerts.

Earwolf,37uz8y,imfromtn,5,Sun May 31 14:11:59 2015 UTC,I got mine but they were both three sizes off of what I ordered.

Earwolf,37vzcr,gabe1108,3,Sun May 31 03:10:06 2015 UTC,"Also, see if you can find their short-lived NBC show, Best Friends Forever."
Earwolf,37vzcr,NewSid,12,Sun May 31 06:53:34 2015 UTC,"I am almost sure that Adam Scott talked about the documentary series The Staircase on UTU2TM. I watched it, and loved it. It's a 6 part series about a husband who may or may not have killed his wife by pushing her down the stairs. Lots of twists and turns. Beautifully made."
Earwolf,37vzcr,lakeradio,9,Sun May 31 00:29:53 2015 UTC,So... it was a spiral staircase?
Earwolf,37vzcr,DanzigMeowMeow,11,Sun May 31 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL!! SO fucking good! I can't believe I put it away for so long. NTSF:SD:SUV is also really good, but man children's hospital is out of this freaking world."
Earwolf,37vzcr,Slayner,2,Sat May 30 23:17:06 2015 UTC,Last weeks episode where it turns out Owen was secretly a monkey? Amazing.
Earwolf,37vzcr,jwalterleavesnotes,2,Sun May 31 09:53:40 2015 UTC,Children's Hospital is hilarious
Earwolf,37vzcr,the_the_the_,8,Sun May 31 11:51:06 2015 UTC,"Nathan for you is probably the best example. I watch/listen to stuff from regular guests on the regular, but rarely am drawn to watch something from someone in the one time club.  That show is a so good and so rewatchable (rewatched both seasons this week)"
Earwolf,37vzcr,GiantDeviantPiano,7,Sun May 31 10:04:33 2015 UTC,"I watched A Band Called Death after hearing about it on Who Charted and it was well worth the watch. On a semi related note, I've been catching up on old episodes of Who Charted and I was so glad to hear them speaking about Hunx, I was super into Gravy Train!!!! (who Howard opened up for back in the day) as a kid and all the Hunx & His Punx stuff is still great."
Earwolf,37vzcr,summahdaze,3,Sat May 30 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"A Band Called Death looks super interesting, it's on the watch list. Hunx! I am liking their style so far, started with Private Room, moving on to new tunes. Thanks for the great response, fellow chartist!"
Earwolf,37vzcr,summahdaze,3,Sat May 30 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"Hunx is super fun, like a Ramones/Ronnettes mix in a John Waters movie. Interesting fact: Hunx/Seth used to also be Moshe Kasher's hairdresser."
Earwolf,37vzcr,oshoney,1 point,Sat May 30 22:00:12 2015 UTC,That makes so much sense.
Earwolf,37vzcr,oshoney,1 point,Sat May 30 22:50:13 2015 UTC,Ohhhh! When does Howard talk about Hunx? What ep?
Earwolf,37vzcr,summahdaze,1 point,Sat May 30 22:50:32 2015 UTC,Episode 70
Earwolf,37vzcr,ernstrohm96,5,Sat May 30 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"The Vampire's Kiss film, recommended by Scott a couple years ago."
Earwolf,37vzcr,kemppettyjohn,13,Sat May 30 21:48:09 2015 UTC,are you referring to I Married a Van Helsing: The Skellington's Kiss?
Earwolf,37vzcr,oshoney,2,Sat May 30 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"Cool! Have seen that still of Mr.Cage as a vampire, but the film? Never heard. Thank you for the response!"
Earwolf,37vzcr,nicemaker,1 point,Sat May 30 22:09:38 2015 UTC,It's so incredibly Nic Cage.
Earwolf,37vzcr,tbboy13,3,Sat May 30 22:50:57 2015 UTC,St. Vincent (oooooh)'s self titled album from last year is really good. I don't think she was promoting it when she was on CBB but she was on Nerdist before it dropped.
Earwolf,37vzcr,AdmEnderDelphiki,3,Sat May 30 23:21:59 2015 UTC,She also did one with David Byrne that was fantastic.
Earwolf,37vzcr,GiantDeviantPiano,9,Sun May 31 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"House of Pies, of course.  I actually really like House of Lies, although I did miss this last season."
Earwolf,37vzcr,Home-Baked,2,Sat May 30 22:13:58 2015 UTC,"Same, loved the show but the most recent season wasn't on iTunes (no legal streaming here) so I didn't bother taking it down outside that"
Earwolf,37vzcr,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Sun May 31 10:01:18 2015 UTC,What we do in the shadows was promoted on Sklarbro and it's probably my favorite movie of the year. I also remember Kumail talking about the TV series Black Mirror which I adore.
Earwolf,37vzcr,KillerPotato_BMW,4,Sun May 31 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"Cake Boss got me to check out this movie about wars in space, it was pretty good."
Earwolf,37vzcr,MondoBizarro,5,Sun May 31 02:08:07 2015 UTC,"U2, Jaws, Party Down, Sleepaway Camp, Babymetal, Review (technically from an ad), Playing House."
Earwolf,37vzcr,ecctv,3,Sun May 31 04:03:07 2015 UTC,"On an old ep of the Todd Glass show, PFT recommended a song called ""Losers"" by Belle Brigade. It's pretty great.  http://youtu.be/J0-HLG7Dxec"
Earwolf,37vzcr,CakeBoss16,2,Sat May 30 22:46:06 2015 UTC,I heard lots of praise for The Babadook on DLM and other podcasts  and I literally just finished watching it. I loved it.
Earwolf,37vzcr,theloniousfunkd,2,Sun May 31 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"It was from a non earwolf podcast. The poundcast had ariel pink on when he released pom pom which became one of my favorite albums of last year. It actually has had a lot of great indie artists : Mac demarco, dirty projectors, and some more."
Earwolf,37vzcr,NardsOfDoom,2,Sun May 31 02:19:20 2015 UTC,Gerry Rafferty - most recent Spont
Earwolf,37vzcr,nohorseman,2,Sun May 31 14:38:14 2015 UTC,Open Mike Eagle made an appearance on a live I4H episode and got me into rap.
Earwolf,37vzcr,KyleCrusoe,1 point,Sun May 31 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"I get frustrated by it and their quick retreat into NPR quiet safe laughs, but Filmspotting has led me to some (especially at the time) underrated hits. I saw Snowpiercer, Under the Skin, and many of the would-be Oscar noms while they were still in the theaters here, and Blue Ruin as soon as it hit Netflix. Felt pretty hip, totally worth all the forced ""huh huh huh"" laughs too close to the mics and audible smiles."
Earwolf,37u13g,Slayner,7,Sat May 30 11:30:19 2015 UTC,Good for you! I'm glad you're figuring things out.   The /r/hollywoodhandbook re-listen has been really fun if y'all haven't checked it out.
Earwolf,37u13g,chicknsandwich,6,Sat May 30 12:56:05 2015 UTC,"Oh is this the plugs comment chain? Hey guys the slack chat is still going and is pretty fun, come on and join us!"
Earwolf,37u13g,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,2,Sat May 30 13:27:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, pm me or slayner your email address and we'll add you"
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,6,Sat May 30 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"Driving 2 hours to see Neutral Milk Hotel today. Gonna be worth it. Unfortunately, I have to wake up early tomorrow morning to drive 2 hours back into town and go to a six hour SAT review session. C'est la vie."
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,4,Sat May 30 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah! They've been around KY a lot, surprisingly. Jeff really seems to enjoy performing, I'd love for that new music the Pitchfork interview guy heard to be released one day"
Earwolf,37u13g,ajcfood,4,Sat May 30 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"Will this be your first time? I've caught them a few times on this reunion tour and each time has been absolutely wonderful. I never thought I'd have a chance to see them, so that makes it extra sweet."
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,2,Sat May 30 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was my first time! What an amazing show. It was at a very small venue, and I got Scott, Julian, and Jeremy to sign my record after the show. Jeff left immediately after the show so I couldn't get his signature, but it was still a fantastic night."
Earwolf,37u13g,bloodflart,5,Tue Jun 2 03:14:14 2015 UTC,I'm very good this weekend. I wish everyone here has a great weekend as well!
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,3,Sat May 30 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"/u/ajcfood, thank you very much for the kind wish.  I'm v glad to hear you're doing well. Keep up all the good work!"
Earwolf,37u13g,carpadium,3,Sat May 30 21:13:05 2015 UTC,When is Reggie's final ep of the tv show? Thought it was this one but they didnt even mention him leaving and I thought he would get a big sendoff ep
Earwolf,37u13g,nicemaker,3,Sat May 30 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's next week, or maaaaybe the one after it.   Scott said he gets a big send off so you'll know when it happens."
Earwolf,37u13g,nicemaker,2,Sat May 30 15:01:33 2015 UTC,Should be ep 20
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,5,Sat May 30 15:18:39 2015 UTC,Had a pretty busy weekend last week so I think I'm just gonna hang out and play Smash and rewatch Hannibal before season 3 starts on Thursday. If you guys aren't watching this show you legit need to stop sleeping on it. Hannibal's up there with Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,3,Sat May 30 16:04:19 2015 UTC,And here I am about to start 24. I'll get there eventually!  eventuallyeventuallyeventuallyeventually...
Earwolf,37u13g,nicemaker,3,Sat May 30 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"Gather 'round children and let me tell you the tale of /u/Slayner Devourer of Content.   If you have the DVR space, definitely start recording Hannibal because if you get through season 2 and realize that you can't watch anymore eps until the blu ray comes out you're gonna go insane."
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,2,Sat May 30 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely on my list, it looks great and from what I read it's right up my alley, but I'm still catching up on all my old crap.   In order of the next 3 things I'm gonna watch it's: mad Men last 2 seasons, I left off at season 5 a couple years ago.  24, and then probably 6 feet under.   I mean hell the last 3 shows I watched were the x files lost and prison break lol, I'm slightly behind the times."
Earwolf,37u13g,ELBdelorean,2,Sat May 30 16:35:53 2015 UTC,Mad Men is the dopest thing
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,2,Sat May 30 19:15:47 2015 UTC,"It's awesome, I didn't stop because I didn't like it, I just wanted the show to finish before I watched any more. It's the perfect show to just buy some whisky sit in the peace and quiet and enjoy."
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,3,Sat May 30 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"Is Hannibal on Netflix or anything? I've been wanting to watch that. I really like Mads Mikkelsen, almost exclusively based on his performance in Casino Royale."
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,2,Sat May 30 16:27:59 2015 UTC,I don't think it's on Netflix but each season is only 13 eps so it shouldn't be too expensive on Amazon or iTunes.
Earwolf,37u13g,potatohead3,2,Sat May 30 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Blah. If they want people to catch up so they can watch the new season, why not put it on Netflix/Hulu/whatever? I'm not gonna pay for an entire series of TV before I even know if I like it. I'd be all over it if it were on Netflix. Now I guess I'll go illegally watch it elsewhere."
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,2,Sat May 30 17:00:09 2015 UTC,It's on Amazon Prime if you have it
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,2,Sat May 30 17:03:36 2015 UTC,If anyone doesn't have Amazon prime they need to get it. Not even for the music or TV. God damn do I love that free 2 day shipping.
Earwolf,37u13g,Emleaux,4,Sat May 30 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"This is still podcast themed, but my brother and I like to do it when we hang out on the weekends, let's try it here! Can't wait to feel that confirmation bias settle in on Monday.  Who do you predict will be on CBB this week? HH?  CBB - Based off Scott's twitter, it seems like the CBBTV wrap party is this weekend. Could be getting a classic PFT ep like last year after that!  HH - Hmm my only guess is Erin Whitehead or Stephanie Allynne. I'd love Benny Schwazz Again treatment, but there are lots of Earwolf regulars that have been on other shows that might be making the rounds too like him.   As many know, like to make another The Secret efforting at CHELSEA PERETTI ON HOLLYWOOD HANDBOOK although I imagine it's not likely just yet. Settling in for a long, very passive campagin"
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,3,Sat May 30 18:39:02 2015 UTC,"Oh man I have no idea where to begin predicting who's on what episode. I keep on holding my breath for Matty B on HH, it's gotta happen eventually right?   Also there's always a small correlation with podcasts when one guest is on one there's a chance they recorded another one while in the studio, so I'm gonna guess Ben Schwartz on CBB Monday.   I'm also gonna guess reggie watts on either Monday or a B-B-B-BONUS-S-S-S-SSSS ep to promote the late late show and his last episode."
Earwolf,37u13g,Slothnamedshotgun,2,Sat May 30 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna make blank wiki pages for Chelsea Peretti, Our Close Friend and Matt Besser, Our Close Friend. You know, just to prepare.  We just use clues from who is making the rounds, who hasn't been on in a while, etc."
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,3,Sat May 30 19:07:25 2015 UTC,"Has anyone here watched United States of Tara? I just finished the first season a few days ago and I'm really enjoying it. A few Earwolf favorites keep popping in - Jessica St. Clair, Nate Corddry, Patton Oswalt, etc. I dunno how I missed this show when it was actually airing. Toni Collette is so good in it."
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,3,Sat May 30 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"I watched some of it quite a few yrs ago, but will now find and watch the episode Jessica St. Clair is in :3"
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,3,Sat May 30 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"She has a two episode arc in the first season, and it's great."
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,4,Sat May 30 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend turns 21 this week (I'm 26 so I guess I'm whatever you call a male cougar?), so I'm excited to not have to sneakily buy her booze anymore. Plus I'm going to a super fancy place for dinner with her family that night that I've always wanted to try but could never afford, so that'll be fun. Then we're seeing Clap Your Hands Say yeah the next night, and they're playing their first album in full so it'll be awesome."
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,5,Sat May 30 13:27:00 2015 UTC,I'm 26 so I guess I'm whatever you call a male cougar?   Mougar.
Earwolf,37u13g,oshoney,2,Sat May 30 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome, I don't think I've ever even heard of that band, is it common to play an entire album though? Sounds really cool."
Earwolf,37u13g,nohorseman,2,Sat May 30 13:30:16 2015 UTC,"Sorta. Bands tend to do something like that on big anniversaries. Not always, but happens enough to be a thing.   For CYHSY, its the 10th anniversary of its release so they're re-issuing it on vinyl and doing an album tour. In this case it's perfect because they never lived up to that excellent first album, so now I know going into it that I'll see all the good stuff. You should check that album out, it's self titled and it's on spotify. It's not for everyone - his voice is very divisive - but I looooove it."

Earwolf,37p1o2,sevillianrites,29,Fri May 29 07:28:52 2015 UTC,I love that this just became them singing 90's sitcom themes.
Earwolf,37p1o2,muddypuddy,10,Fri May 29 10:01:38 2015 UTC,And that they just sort of gave up doing their characters to do it (especially Benny)
Earwolf,37p1o2,requisite_monocle,18,Fri May 29 12:52:06 2015 UTC,"I like how at one point he was like ""no this is real."" Ben barely gave a fuck about his character to begin with, so I died when he straight up dropped it to sing 90s theme songs."

Earwolf,37p1o2,TheandreGreyjordan,4,Fri May 29 14:30:17 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I would subscribe to a podcast where Benny Schwaz just does a weekly podcast of him and a guest singing stupid songs that they both know for 20 minutes straight.
Earwolf,37p1o2,TheBlackSpank,16,Tue Jun 2 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Great episode such a delight anytime Ben and someone burst into song.  A lot of highlights really, Ben and Lauren just bounce off each other so damn well.  Also benny schwazz needs to have his own podcast, we got Lauren Lapkus Andy daly Horatio Sanz and PFT their own, now we need him to!"

Earwolf,37p1o2,RedFrogMario,12,Fri May 29 23:56:30 2015 UTC,Ben has an amazing ability to quickly and sleazily convince people to sing and/or come up with ridiculous names.
Earwolf,37p1o2,bloodflart,6,Sat May 30 06:57:50 2015 UTC,He is manipulative in the best way
Earwolf,37p1o2,katiebug88,7,Sat May 30 14:12:53 2015 UTC,he definitely has a tendency to pimp his 'scene partners' which I usually find annoying but he plays with such skilled improvisers it doesn't throw them off it just leads to amazingness!

Earwolf,37p7yf,Emleaux,4,Fri May 29 15:02:15 2015 UTC,Very cool! I've gotten a shoutout before and it is the weirdest thing to hear Howard and Kulap say your name out loud like that.
Earwolf,37p7yf,JasmineForsythe,8,Fri May 29 17:21:55 2015 UTC,I've noticed that Twooch episodes have much more of a response on here than Whooch. I wonder why that is.
Earwolf,37p7yf,LaurenLapkus,19,Fri May 29 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think Stard has a genuine chemistry with Howard and Kulap, and is legitimately a great addition to the team. Also, the looser/more personal structure allows for delving deeper into the Howardisms that make most of us love the show in the first place"
Earwolf,37p7yf,Prax150,9,Fri May 29 17:07:28 2015 UTC,Plus the guests can be hit or miss.
Earwolf,37p7yf,PDCchewie88,5,Fri May 29 18:00:09 2015 UTC,The Kremerisms really started to take off after Howard gave his earbud a coffee bath

Earwolf,37p1p4,Tahler,9,Fri May 29 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"I was at the late show that night and he does it even more there, can't wait to hear it again, lots of shaming people there wearing shorts"
Earwolf,37p1p4,Memphish_Boognish,7,Fri May 29 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"I can't believe they didn't mention the soundtrack. It's like they took one long track from a ""Sounds of Italy"" record one might have for their Italian restaurant, and then cut that up into like six different tracks for this movie. It's such an odd choice and never worked well for any scene it was used in."
Earwolf,37p1p4,reverendnathan,7,Sat May 30 03:53:56 2015 UTC,Can't wait to listen. This movie is SO hilariously bad. It's on Netflix instant for anyone who hasn't watched.
Earwolf,37p1p4,oshoney,3,Fri May 29 14:20:14 2015 UTC,Is this movie worth watching before the episode?
Earwolf,37p1p4,patrickthewhite1,8,Fri May 29 14:19:53 2015 UTC,Absolutely. It's almost unbelievable how bad it is. And how unintelligible Arnold is.
Earwolf,37p1p4,oshoney,3,Fri May 29 14:21:02 2015 UTC,Yet they famously overdubbed his voice in this movie with some random guy without an accent.
Earwolf,37p1p4,Emleaux,8,Fri May 29 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"Not in the version on Netflix currently, and we're all better for it."

Earwolf,37p1p4,Emleaux,3,Fri May 29 15:38:10 2015 UTC,Haha I got that version somehow. It's so distracting.
Earwolf,37p1p4,mi-16evil,3,Fri May 29 21:49:13 2015 UTC,this is the first time they've done a movie I haven't seen that I feel like I NEED to watch it asap
Earwolf,37p1p4,katiebug88,-9,Fri May 29 20:29:11 2015 UTC,"Why do they always let women skip the question line? If they want to ask a question then fucking get up and get in line when it's time. At this point I think they stay put because they know Paul is going say ""any ladies in the audience"" and they can just skip everyone."

What if hdtgm came to your town, you scored tickets, had a question ready to go then right before it was your turn 20 girls get to skip you?"
Earwolf,37p1p4,void_rocket,3,Sat May 30 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"If CBB shows are any indication, maybe it's because the audience is 75-80% male. The CBB live tour show I went to was so overwhelmingly penis heavy"

Earwolf,37mwio,Prax150,11,Thu May 28 20:17:50 2015 UTC,AMC has DEFINITELY gotten their moneys worth out of giving Howard that free pass.  Howard devotes at least a couple of minutes every episode promoting AMC theaters.  The guy who gave him that pass should get a raise for a shrewd marketing move.
Earwolf,37mwio,newprofile15,18,Thu May 28 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but think of all the money AMC loses with rogue concession workers using the drinktangles as secondary popcorn holders!"

Both start with a disclaimer, it took awhile for Ed Helms and Will Forte to get what the show was about. Pretty boring shows, not fun to listen to.  In hindsight I find Analyze Phish hard to listen to. Harris telling fun drug stories, while knowing how serious those problems were for him and the internal struggle he was dealing with at the time. Now its more like a depressing This American Life than funny Earwolf show."
Earwolf,37kfr2,nicholasalotalos,15,Thu May 28 09:12:10 2015 UTC,But he called Sean a homo. That's funny right?
Earwolf,37kfr2,klobbermang,11,Thu May 28 19:49:23 2015 UTC,Pauly Shore's HH ep. He was a bit of a dick.     It's never a good sign when H&S go out of their way to talk to Engineer Codyboy. Good thing he was on fire with @FindCelebsNearArbys and his Old School references. He definitely brought more to the table than Pauly
Earwolf,37kfr2,WhosCountin,13,Thu May 28 15:57:33 2015 UTC,The EHH WRONG segment in the following episode almost made the Pauly Shore ep worth it.
Earwolf,37kfr2,Gambit-One,7,Thu May 28 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"The Helms episode was a fun one, I think. His character took awhile to get off the ground (understandably, as he was blindsided to do it ), but he definitely got it going. Not a top ten episode or anything, but I liked it.  The Forte one was weird. He just didn't seem to get the format. Not his fault, but a shame."

Earwolf,37kfr2,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,35,Fri May 29 02:33:38 2015 UTC,"Episode 46 of CBB with Ben Stiller might qualify. Nothing especially dramatic happened, but as I remember Stiller only stayed for part of the show and treated it as a conventional opportunity to promote a project. Didn't seem to understand what show he was on. I think Scott has referred to that episode in disappointment a couple of times.  The recent Tom Green 'Sorry to bring the mood down (Dead dog story)' episode may go down in infamy too."
Earwolf,37kfr2,dabbling,5,Thu May 28 08:14:49 2015 UTC,"That was one of the first episodes I ever listened to because the guest lineup is so strong (also had Jeff Garlin, PFT, and Andy Daly). Ben Stiller's segment wasn't great, but I remember liking the rest of the show."
Earwolf,37kfr2,sleepsholymountain,9,Thu May 28 14:22:44 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty low tolerance for awkwardness (and Tom Green, for that matter), and I didn't think his recent CBB appearance was that bad. Not all that funny to be sure, but the vibe was good. And Trabitha Tarteen was there!"
Earwolf,37kfr2,tenyearsyounger,7,Thu May 28 22:56:19 2015 UTC,I don't think I'll ever listen to the Tom Green episode.  It's a pretty rare occasion where I'll see some guest and just refuse to listen to it... but at this point I think Tom Green qualifies.
Earwolf,37kfr2,newprofile15,3,Thu May 28 22:31:06 2015 UTC,Why? I like Tom Green and I could've swore I listened to that episode but don't remember anything terrible about it. Seemed like they did do a lot of industry type chat though.
Earwolf,37kfr2,Khanstant,1 point,Thu May 28 22:36:37 2015 UTC,It was a recent one.  Maybe I'm mistaken... he just strikes me as a guy who would be unwilling to embrace the spirit of the show.

It was for a film festival and they did a comedian Q&A with Michael ian black, mike Myers, and ben stiller. He was so awkward. Every time someone complemented him he was aggressively modest to the point where you could tell they others were uncomfortable. Maybe he just doesn't interview well?"

Earwolf,37kfr2,Gambit-One,35,Thu May 28 22:31:15 2015 UTC,The Chris Gore episode of Who Charted would qualify. Dude comes off as kind of a creepy sexist predator and I believe it was pretty universally reviled. It still comes up all the time as a sort of 'bad guest' measuring stick.
Earwolf,37kfr2,mrseantron,6,Thu May 28 12:40:02 2015 UTC,He was terrible when he was a guest on improv4humans too. He seems awful.

Earwolf,37kfr2,VanceFerguson,4,Thu May 28 16:51:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't particularly like Nova, but I also didn't think she was that bad. Howard was pretty smitten with her, so it was kind of fun to hear him gush."
Earwolf,37kfr2,mrseantron,4,Thu May 28 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind that episode either, but I think a lot of people were mad at how blissfully unaware of the world around her she was. Compare that to the Kitty guest spot that had a few months later and there's a world of difference in listener reaction, despite being very similar artists."
Earwolf,37kfr2,VanceFerguson,10,Thu May 28 21:01:07 2015 UTC,Kitty was definitely the polar opposite of Nova. Nova basically took an attitude of 'I deserve to be successful and you need to recognize that' while Kitty was so self-deprecating it was like she was apologizing for any success she had.
Earwolf,37kfr2,mrseantron,4,Thu May 28 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that was the difference that made people okay with Kitty, which was her ""wow, this is so cool that people like what I'm doing"" whereas Nova had more of a ""I do cool shit, get into me"" vibe.  I think at first glance, Chartists saw a young, white, female rapper and thought, ""here we go again"", but there's quite a bit of personality difference between them."
Earwolf,37kfr2,VanceFerguson,27,Fri May 29 03:41:38 2015 UTC,"Not earwolf, but the YOU MADE IT WEIRD #83 live with Eric Andre Jackie Kashian, Jon Glaser and Brett Gelman got to the cringe level of that DLM ep.  Basically Pete outs Glaser as the runner up for the e-trade baby voice and Glaser was not cool with that. it sets up an ultra uncomfortable vibe for the rest of the show and Gelman gets really upset at some point later on (might just be his ""character "" though)  I really love train wreck postcasts for some reason"
Earwolf,37kfr2,Maracle2,16,Thu May 28 14:31:46 2015 UTC,"While on the topic of non earwolf eps, there is an episode on WTF with Marc Mah-ron with Gallagher where Gallagher takes everything said the wrong way and ends up storming off.

Earwolf,37kfr2,Pluppets,8,Thu May 28 20:07:14 2015 UTC,That episode is amazing - Gallagher is fascinating to listen to just to hear how insane and delusional he is.  He has an appearance on Opie and Anthony where he probably comes off even worse.

WhoCharted has a few. The Chris Gore episode is obvious, but I at least listened all the way through that one for how unbelievably tone-deaf that dude was. I also was able to make it through Nova Rockafeller episode because the lack of self-awareness and talking-out-her-ass was almost parody, and Jensen Karp trying to play PR man live was entertaining. But I consider myself a completest-Chartist and still couldn't make it through Steve-O's episode."

Earwolf,37kfr2,newprofile15,3,Thu May 28 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"The Tony Clifton episode is so unbelievably weird.  He's like a real life Don Dimello.  But he's also a character.  But also definitely did not feel like a character during the episode, certainly not in the way that a character like Dimello is just plainly a character.  It felt out of place at the time but I don't remember really caring that much one way or another.  Don't remember it being particularly funny."
Earwolf,37kfr2,al_leight,3,Thu May 28 22:46:43 2015 UTC,It wasn't really hilarious but I did find it rather interesting. I enjoyed the stories about Jim Carrey getting casted as Kaufman.

Earwolf,37kfr2,newprofile15,4,Thu May 28 22:02:23 2015 UTC,He's a racist and misogynist character.  Showed up with two girls who he treated like prostitutes.  He's kind of a Don Dimello like character.  I think the backlash in part reflected confusion over whether or not the guy is really a character.
Earwolf,37kfr2,jwalterleavesnotes,3,Thu May 28 22:54:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's because there was no wink wink type deal. He'd just randomly say something horribly racist or something, no real joke behind it."

I understand Howard sometimes has conflicts with the podcast taping and can't make them all. I listen to Who Charted? for Howard and all his fun musings about summah and hatred towards space - he and Kulap have a great chemistry as well.   Armen was an okay substitute for a few episodes a while back, but now he's been on more than a few episodes and I don't personally care for his style or the manner in which he talks.

Earwolf,37kfr2,JasmineForsythe,2,Thu May 28 19:18:52 2015 UTC,I think the Billy Eichner ep is one of maybe one or two episodes that I turned off part way through.

I still am not sure of the ""real"" story.  The ep with James Adomian as PSH haunts me to this day."
Earwolf,37kfr2,Fatmanredemption,20,Thu May 28 13:04:58 2015 UTC,"The Kristen Schaal thing was a stunt that was too drawn out to work effectively. The special was an intentional disaster and supposed to be cringe comedy. When she came onto the show after it had aired a few months later she and Scott laughed about it being a hoax, but the joke had too much time in between setup and punchline."
Earwolf,37kfr2,mrseantron,2,Thu May 28 13:45:12 2015 UTC,What's wrong with the PSH episode? Besides the fact that Hoffman died? (a while after)
Earwolf,37kfr2,Fatmanredemption,8,Thu May 28 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Philip Seymour Hoffman drags his sex-slave Paul Giamatti into the studio and forces him to read the script to the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie while they both wear full-body costumes for their respective characters (Giamatti is Tails, PSH is Sonic.) The scene involves Sonic anally penetrating Tails and then cumming in his mouth, a taste which Giamatti admits is ""not that bad"" after a dozen or so times of getting used to it. Meanwhile, Scott forces his nephew Todd to watch the whole scene while being spanked and repeating the phrase ""I have a red Indian butt."" Half-way through the scene Todd alludes to being sexually aroused by this anal furry sex. PSH experiences post-coital lament and tearfully professes his shame for having raped such a talented actor."
Earwolf,37kfr2,mrseantron,8,Fri May 29 01:15:14 2015 UTC,I love Adomian but I totally needed brain bleach after that ep.
Earwolf,37kfr2,Gambit-One,6,Fri May 29 01:21:37 2015 UTC,"To be honest I actually like that episode a lot. Not that part specifically, but it's Todd's first episode, we're likely never going to hear another PSH appearance, and I just think it's a fucking blast anytime James Adomian does two characters at once. Plus, his Paul Giamatti impression has me laughing uncontrollably in public places. Like, remember the episode with Andy Dick and Janeane Garofalo? It's not that good, but when James enters after the break it's one of my favorite moments in CBB history. Even when Janeane isn't really playing a good straight man (it almost sounds like she's offended that Giamatti's being mocked,) James is just too funny for the moment to be ruined.  On that same tangent, an infamous CBB episode for me is one of the live ones with James Adomian doing Paul Giamatti. Somehow, the crowd is not having it. It's just not going over. During the last ten minutes somebody in the audience shouts, ""Tom Leykis!"" Made me kind of sad for James. Made me think maybe I was wrong for liking the Giamatti character in the first place. That's how susceptible I am."
Earwolf,37kfr2,sedef122,5,Fri May 29 01:35:25 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree for the most part re: James, he just took that character pair so dark that I remember feeling physically uncomfortable. It's a rare CBB that I can't re-listen to. But I do love any time Scott basically plays an insane, evil version of himself with Todd.  I've noticed that Earwolf live audiences can be a real mixed bag. Adomian can play so many interesting characters, there's just just no reason to box him in like that."
Earwolf,37kfr2,mi-16evil,2,Fri May 29 13:31:13 2015 UTC,I remember it perfectly. Problem?  Todd never lost his virginity to Paul Giamatti!

Earwolf,37kfr2,ColonelOfSka,16,Fri May 29 19:21:59 2015 UTC,I thought that Scotty (and myself) found the juxtoposition of Corny Grandpa and Zizek to be bizzare and hilarious.
Earwolf,37kfr2,headless_bourgeoisie,6,Thu May 28 18:08:00 2015 UTC,Cross comes off like a total asshole in that one. He definitely derailed it.

I don't care who else is on or what they're doing or what their attitude is about anything, that's enough. I'm over the moon, I'm ecstatic. Oh, and the fact that Scott was put off by Slavoj either as a bit or seriously? That's icing on the cake. I'd just seen The Pervert's Guide to Cinema and The Pervert's Guide to Ideology the previous week, so that podcast came out at the perfect time.  (btw if you really want something infamous go and watch Hits! It could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Definitely in the bottom 5)"
Earwolf,37kfr2,Elaine_Benes_,6,Sat May 30 19:47:27 2015 UTC,It's not necessarily infamous but there was one older ep of Sklarbro Country where they got Terrell Owens on. It actually went decent for 90% of the show but at one point he brings up how he's against gay marriage and it gets awkward.

CBB Halloween episode of ""Welcome to Suicide House"" was rough sledding. The following year it got better, and Jon Daly, Hot Saucerman and Brett Gelman's awareness that with any given line, they may have worn out this premise is funny in an awkward way.   I think the others are pretty great with some classic lines and bits, like Suicide House being at ""1-1-2-2 Boogie Woogie Avenue"", or hearing ""The Monster Fuck"" song."

Earwolf,37kfr2,the_three_stans,2,Fri May 29 04:29:42 2015 UTC,"Marc Maron on Ronna and Beverly was kind of awkward. He's a miserable prick and has low tolerance for character work (which makes me wonder why he agreed to it in the first place), so he was just mean and nasty to R&B the whole episode. He even called them cunts at one point. Excuse me. You don't call Boston's sweethearts cunts you miserable dick."
Earwolf,37kfr2,Emleaux,-14,Fri May 29 08:33:00 2015 UTC,"CBB 162 Best Bro Hang with Andy Samberg and Adam Pally was a super awkward episode and Scott never misses a moment to mention how upset he was with Adam Pally for his bahavior. You can listen to Scott trash talk it when it was in the top ten best of the year episode as well as any time either Andy Samberg or Adam Pally get mentioned that episode will always come up. Basically Adam Pally was late that day and Scott texted him to coming in and jump into the show as his character and do his thing. Adam said he interpreted this to mean derail the show, but he just came across as resentful towards Andy because he didn't want to be some goofball character while Andy got to promote a bunch of cool projects he was doing. Adam pretty much dropped his Bro character and started talking as himself and Scott kept doing a straight interview with Andy and tried to steer Adam back into character. Adam took a few digs at Andy for the rest of the episode and the whole thing was very awkward and confrontational.  Edit: You guys are all wrong btw. Go back and listen to CBB 181 which was Adam's next appearance (and final one on CBB). Scott brought up the incident several times and was clearly not happy about it and Adam kept trying to explain himself. Doesn't take a clinical psychologist to tell they was some real animosity there. Not sure if you guys are delusional or just oblivious."
Earwolf,37kfr2,Memphish_Boognish,16,Sat May 30 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah Scott usually runs such a tight ship, it was a real shame to see Adam Pally make a mockery of the regimented showbiz institution that is Comedy Bang Bang"
Earwolf,37kfr2,WhosCountin,14,Thu May 28 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"They all laughed when Pally said Scott texted him to come ""derail the show."" I think that episode was very fun to listen to, especially when they get into all that Woody Allen ""Oh yeah"" Entourage stuff.  When you bring up an opinion about something as subjective as a comedy podcast that you are trying to pass as fact and you feel the need to tell people that ""they are all wrong,"" people will more than likely tend to disagree with you. You can say you thought CBB episode 162 was awkward - that's fine. Just don't go telling people that they are either wrong or right."
Earwolf,37kfr2,thecricketnerd,29,Thu May 28 19:44:00 2015 UTC,Scott making fun of that episode was 100% a joke. It wasn't awkward at all and was a hilarious episode
Earwolf,37kfr2,Ed_Sullivision,14,Thu May 28 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get the sense that Adam, Andy, and Scott all legitimately have a great time together. I don't think Adam was resentful at all, just being funny and not giving a shit about staying in character. It's like his story with the press conference and Shaq; it doesn't sound like he was trying to cause problems so much as he was trying to entertain himself and didn't care if that resulted in some problems"
Earwolf,37kfr2,newprofile15,16,Thu May 28 15:34:34 2015 UTC,"I kinda just took that as Scott making fun of how loose(ly disguised) Adam's character was. Like, just ripping on the poor character work."
Earwolf,37kfr2,KyleCrusoe,14,Thu May 28 15:53:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't agree. This and the previous Andy/Bro ep are two of my favorite episodes because there's some moments on it that made me almost cry laughing the first time I heard it. I've listened to it several times and I've never sensed anything confrontational or awkward about it. The fact that Adam barely had a grip on his character was what made it so great. Scott knows this and always points out inconsistencies in thin characters because it usually leads to some great comedy (see every Horatio episode ever). And I'm pretty sure the whole ""Bro derailing the show"" was just kind of the point of the episode. Then again, I didn't listen to this best of where Scott talked about it, I've just never sensed any resentment or awkwardness."

Earwolf,37ktm4,lemonpjb,8,Thu May 28 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"HH has pretty much taken over my podcast listening for the last month or so. The only CBB episode I've listened to all the way through since jumping into HH is the Sean and Hayes episode... Though I did make it through most of the anniversary special.    As far as non-Sean/Hayes CBB guests go my favorites are: 1. Harris 2. Adam Pally/Bro 2. Lauren Lapkus as Todd or Tracy 3. Tim Heidecker (and Eric) 4. Neal Campbell and Paul Rust 6. Wompler and Listler 6. Brett Gelman 7. PFT sometimes, mainly as Herzog and Mike the Janitor. Sometimes I find him really annoying, like as JW Stillwater. 8. Eddie Peppitone's impotent teamster character    That's not a hard and fast ranking really"

Non-Earwolf: Gilmore Guys, Call Chelsea Peretti, Serial, Call Your Girlfriend, Nerdist (depending on the guest), Pop Culture Happy Hour, Pop Rocket, Reply All, The Sporkful, and You Made It Weird (depending on the guest).   I'm not entirely surprised that your survey worked out at that percentage. I do think Earwolf does a pretty good job at diversity of hosts and guests but I still think a lot of it can be very male heavy at times. I think reddit cuts that percentage significantly lower (I'm not going to lie I was super hesitant to even visit Reddit for the first time).

I think I know less women who listen to podcasts at all, so that might explain it.  I dabble in a bunch of shows, but the ones I consistently listen to in order of obsession are:    The special rare ones: Andy Daly's Podcast Pilot Project, UTU2TM, Analyze Phish Professor Blastoff Hollywood Handbook (nice and funny although I secretly miss Reality Show Show sometimes, don't hate me) Comedy Bang Bang  How Did This Get Made? Who Charted? Womp It Up   Been meaning to get into Never Not Funny and SPONT but I have yet to do so. I wish I could get into i4h, but I miss too many jokes if I'm working while listening, and Besser's booming voice means I can't listen while I'm trying to sleep.  I would listen to a Wild Horses podcast so hard."
Earwolf,37ff3v,thatssoravens,2,Wed May 27 15:18:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe comedy is just boy friendly in general? Waaaaay more males in comedy than girls, so maybe it just naturally translates to comedy podcasts.   Which sucks because there are so many AWESOME female comedians that I've discovered solely through podcasting! There was a R/AskWomen thread a couple weeks ago about finding new girl comedians and I campaigned for Lapkus + Wild Horses and Perreti so hard. Didn't see them mentioned by anyone else though."
Earwolf,37ff3v,theloniousfunkd,3,Thu May 28 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"A non-Earwolf show I think most of the ladies here (and I'm sure the fellas) will enjoy is The JV Club with Janet Varney on the Nerdist network.  Lots of female Earwolf favorites, along with general comedy/acting/writing/music stars that you'll find interesting.  She also did a ""boys of summer"" series last summer.  The show is generally talking about their childhood and adolescent years, and it is so much fun, though I am not ashamed to admit I've cried (OMG TIG'S EPISODE).    I have such a lady-hardon for Janet, it's ridiculous.  http://nerdist.com/podcasts/the-jv-club-channel/"

When visiting the Stern show, Van Dam is given material by the show's staff.

Earwolf,37ayy0,nyan_swanson,5,Tue May 26 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"I used to be a sound engineer and it's pretty easy to make it sound good, but not if you're just recording them by mic-ing up a computer with a skype session running which is what I think they do at earwolf. I'm sure their engineers could do better but I don't think the studio really cares if it's a little shitty as long as you can understand them"
Earwolf,37ayy0,katiebug88,2,Tue May 26 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"Considering that Hayes got a studio for the last show, it really wouldn't be hard to get good sound quality for the show. Even if Earwolf isn't equipped to do a direct link, they could tape synch while speaking to Hayes over Skype (He would record his own track and email his audio to add in post).  Not that I mind very much. Still an enjoyable ep."
Earwolf,37ayy0,mitchwinner,2,Wed May 27 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"If they don't wanna pay for the equipment to do a direct link they probably don't wanna pay for the extra studio time at a non-earwolf studio either. Using an external studio is probably way more expensive than paying their in-house engineers for that time, so they probably try to avoid it. Ideally they'd get an ISDN and hook up with Hayes at a studio in NY with an ISDN and it'd sound like they're all in the same space.  I am kinda fucked up sry if I said the word ""probably"" one million times"

Earwolf,376gwp,sevillianrites,1 point,Wed May 27 03:49:33 2015 UTC,For sure. Also Harmontown really isn't the venue for improv characters. A lot of Harmenians disliked his appearance because it didn't match the tone of the show.

I understand there's a lot of pressure on being a performer and you need to be in a certain headspace to do it, we respect that, but come on man, don't be snarky and rude to the people who are helping to put your show together."

I think I like his lower brow characters a bit more, but I can see how that's maybe boring to him as a comedian and doesn't have much room to grow."
Earwolf,376gwp,pat965,4,Tue May 26 04:34:50 2015 UTC,"I think it really just comes down to how well you know the person he's spoofing. His Zizek was spot on, it was easily one of his most impressive characters to me especially because you can tell he actually understands (on some level) what Zizek is all about, which is no easy task. Some of his characters like Leykis and Ventura are funny without really knowing the source material, but they are still much better if you know where he's drawing the little ticks and jokes from."
Earwolf,376gwp,jayraay,-2,Tue May 26 07:10:12 2015 UTC,It felt like it was too political. Like Adomian was just trying to drum up support for Sanders by making him more likeable.

Earwolf,376gwp,SirPribsy,0,Tue May 26 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"He's reaching an audience that appreciates humor. The absurd impersonation is not really a satirical take on him to poke fun, but lifting him up in a funny self-deprecating way to appeal to this audience."
Earwolf,376gwp,ShockinglyEfficient,4,Tue May 26 17:55:26 2015 UTC,"Think it just comes down to a matter of mindset going into it on this one. I can easily see how they took some of his more ridiculous takes on politics (universal base income, income inequality ""stats"") and poked fun at them.  I get the sense that maybe calling satire ""too political"" is a result of the critic being too politically minded."

If they had attempted to portray the character as a realistic version of 5 year old then it would have just been straight up shock humor, but I thought they kept it weird and silly enough the whole time that they never crossed into an uncomfortable territory."

With that an unfortunate impossibility I think that Eric Andre would be absolutely bananas on their show. I think he would try to throw out the whole format of the show and I would love to see the boys try and handle it like they did with Pauly Shore.
Earwolf,375tzg,Jakemasterflex,1 point,Mon May 25 11:49:16 2015 UTC,Eric Andre would be excellent!

Oh and Matt Besser   Edit: oh and my dream scenario for Besser to be on, is to be like a bad improviser or something and Sean (a ucb student) pass him, student becomes the master type scenario.   That or the exact opposite, like all Matt does is shit on Hayes and Sean the whole episode, he's just super mean to them, being the harsh teacher type of thing.   I could totally see either one playing out."
Earwolf,375tzg,nohorseman,16,Mon May 25 03:35:05 2015 UTC,Yes Chelsea Peretti is my new campaign to undergo since they made it on CBB.   Jimmy Pardo a distant second.
Earwolf,375tzg,Slayner,9,Mon May 25 03:58:50 2015 UTC,Ooh Jimmy pardon would be good too.
Earwolf,375tzg,brosephjyant,9,Mon May 25 04:01:04 2015 UTC,Besser needs to be on every show. He's the best. I keep hoping he'll pop up on Spontaneanation.

Earwolf,375tzg,thejjar,5,Mon May 25 22:08:34 2015 UTC,Todd would get so nervous.  He would be concerned the whole episode that they were making fun of him
Earwolf,375tzg,TheDimasBow,1 point,Wed May 27 04:35:22 2015 UTC,Just let him put some extra reverb on the mic and he'll feel right at home.
Earwolf,375tzg,TheBlackSpank,3,Tue Jun 2 01:16:48 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind them getting more regular actors on there that don't really get what Sean and Hayes are doing. And Besser should have been on a while ago.

Earwolf,375tzg,awesomeman462,4,Mon May 25 21:39:28 2015 UTC,Don't really hate him; he's just way too enthusiastic about everything. Who needs that!?

Earwolf,373eg4,AdmEnderDelphiki,7,Sun May 24 14:59:31 2015 UTC,Very accurate.  You might even say laser accurate.
Earwolf,373eg4,Slayner,4,Mon May 25 02:59:48 2015 UTC,Great analogy actually
Earwolf,373eg4,nohorseman,13,Sun May 24 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not an i4h completist but I love love loved the trilogy episode, particularly the first one where Jon gets forced to deliver and nails it. I listened to it wrapping presents for Christmas last year and it was a great time."
Earwolf,373eg4,Drocavelli,6,Sun May 24 15:10:13 2015 UTC,Have you listened to the 4/20 episodes from the last couple of years? Gabrus and Gemberling. Could be two of my top five i4h eps of all time.
Earwolf,373eg4,Slayner,3,Sun May 24 19:32:47 2015 UTC,I liked this years 4/20 ep more than last years but I don't get the hype over them. They're good but I didn't love them as much as most people I guess.
Earwolf,373eg4,Drocavelli,1 point,Sun May 24 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"They're pretty messy. I just appreciate that they're really off the wall. They seem a lot less structured than most shows. I don't think I would appreciate the ""4/20-style"" episode every week, but they're great for a departure from the norm once in a while. A lot of people dislike the musical guest(MYOOOSICLE GUEST!!!)episodes, but I don't mind them for the same reason. A nice departure from the normal format."
Earwolf,373eg4,Slayner,8,Sun May 24 22:25:11 2015 UTC,"Out of every single earwolf guest, I wish I could share a drink or two with Gabrus.   Aside from that, God damn what an amazing improviser, idk what I like better his constant interruptions and questions as Gino on CBB or any of his appearances on I4H where he can turn the scene into the most grotesque thing imaginable.   Top 5 guests easily."
Earwolf,373eg4,changry_perdvert,3,Sun May 24 14:37:45 2015 UTC,"You didn't even mention his HH appearances.  I'm disappointed in you, Slaynerd."
Earwolf,373eg4,WhosCountin,5,Sun May 24 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, until you've heard Gabrus riffing on the newspaper you have no idea what he's capable of"
Earwolf,373eg4,nohorseman,2,Sun May 24 20:09:42 2015 UTC,Have you heard his You Made it Weird? One of my faves (not that I've listened to that many). He comes off very thoughtful and interesting (and funny)
Earwolf,373eg4,Slayner,4,Sun May 24 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't but I listened to both his Totally Laime and I know he's a pretty smart guy, who just did dumb shit when he was younger."
Earwolf,373eg4,traunks,6,Sun May 24 14:46:40 2015 UTC,"I like him on i4h, but I LOVE him on cbb. Few other characters than Gino have given me as many consistently solid laughs per minute. Also, he seems to be a man of the people and interacts with fans on a lot on twitter, etc. He favorites pretty much any reply he gets, which to me is a nice gesture to say you appreciate your fanbase."
Earwolf,373eg4,JonBoyWhite,4,Sun May 24 17:03:19 2015 UTC,He seems like the type of guy that would be totally normal to hang out with. He's also quick to respond on twitter. Seems like he really appreciates the pseudo celebrity status he's achieved. Gino kills me.
Earwolf,373eg4,istartriots,4,Sun May 24 16:28:39 2015 UTC,Love Gabrus. I don't have a lot to contribute to this thread other than the improv 4 humans 4/20 special from this year features him and has some straight bonkers meta humor and completely off the walls scenerios that is definitely worth a listen.  Gino is hands down one of my favorite CBB characters as well.  edit: his hollywood handbook episode is really funny as well. I am not a big HH person but this episode was very easy to get into.   He is a riot!
Earwolf,373eg4,ksaid1,3,Sun May 24 18:53:01 2015 UTC,"Known for outside the Wolf: Guy Code   Woo hoo! Tell us more about side chicks, Jon! :p  He's so clever and so funny. Hopefully he's gonna get a shot on a legitimate show someday. Maybe the holiday show on TruTV?"
Earwolf,373eg4,samantha-mulder,3,Sun May 24 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"Recently went to an improv at UCB Sunset he was in called ""My F'ed Up Family"" where they ask an audience member with the craziest childhood about said childhood and then base the show around it. I grew up in a cult so I obviously won, got interviewed by Jon Gabrus - I am here to tell you he is so nice, he was a very safe space. So not only is he funny, from what I gathered he's also a really kind and friendly person."
Earwolf,373eg4,WhosCountin,1 point,Sun May 24 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"Well, that explains why he's one of the few repeat guests on a show as nice as Holywood Handbook."
Earwolf,373eg4,TheandreGreyjordan,3,Sun May 24 20:06:40 2015 UTC,I remember Jon Gabrus from Brohemian Rhapsody maybe a decade ago.  Dude's killing it since and I look forward to any appearance he makes.
Earwolf,373eg4,pbbatenatar,3,Sun May 24 21:59:34 2015 UTC,Gabrus was in one of my favourite CollegeHumor sketches
Earwolf,373eg4,jerrbles,2,Mon May 25 00:14:05 2015 UTC,His appearance on Hollywood Handbook was the first episode of that pod that I listened to its fucking hilarious.
Earwolf,3753bf,chicknsandwich,39,Sun May 24 23:18:20 2015 UTC,I think he'll be too cheesed off about dads and grads to worry about it.

Earwolf,372416,ksaid1,5,Sun May 24 13:52:29 2015 UTC,"Every time she plays a male character she talks about her dick. And most of her male characters are, like, 13 years old."

Earwolf,372416,thecolorifix,5,Sun May 24 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"He's definitely one of the best, I hope they use him a lot."
Earwolf,372416,TheBlackSpank,4,Sun May 24 13:39:20 2015 UTC,He absolutely counts. He's got an improv background. Have you listened to his episode of With Special Guest? He does sort of a weird Harry Cary type version of himself.
Earwolf,372416,MacManji,48,Sun May 24 14:03:40 2015 UTC,I have to go with Andy Daly just on the basis of how great he is even when Mantzoukas is dragging his characters all over the place.
Earwolf,372416,mrmastermustard,18,Sun May 24 04:51:23 2015 UTC,Him flipping the script on Mantzoukas and telling him to read a limrick from his book is one of my favourite moments.
Earwolf,372416,Yahoozy,37,Sun May 24 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"Andy Daly, Neil Campbell, and Adomian are my perennial favorites. Sucker for ridiculous characters."

Earwolf,372416,thecricketnerd,29,Sun May 24 07:03:44 2015 UTC,I'll go with Gourley too. Ben Schwartz is another favorite.
Earwolf,372416,bigontheinside,27,Sun May 24 03:54:10 2015 UTC,No one has mentioned Matt Besser? FOLKS!
Earwolf,372416,splice_of_life,6,Sun May 24 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"Besser's like a legend, though.  He literally wrote the book on improv.  His scene choices and cut-to's are without equal."
Earwolf,372416,MysticBounce,27,Sun May 24 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"Sticking to people not mentioned yet:  Nick Kroll. He used to appear way more and his character work helped set the tone for CBB. I think most of his early episodes are essential alongside PFT, Adomian, Daly etc.  Adam McKay is my favorite underrated I4H guest. I was blindsided by how hilarious his episodes are, and I believe both are with only 3 humans. Check them out.  Eugene Cordero. Does quintessential CBB characters. You don't get how stupid the premise is at first, and then once it's figured out, he just makes it more ridiculous and wont let it go. Definitely reminds me of Neil Campbell and Joe Wengert.   Tim Heidecker just for the ep where he talks about doing a Woody Allen film and doing improv based on Star Trek. The dryest absurd humor ever between him and Scott."
Earwolf,372416,ElectricMarmalade,10,Sun May 24 10:32:11 2015 UTC,"That Heidecker bit was great, but personally I prefer the one where he talks about selling unofficial whistles at Who concerts."
Earwolf,372416,thecolorifix,11,Sun May 24 15:26:51 2015 UTC,I love the interactions between Tim Heidecker and Scotty Auckz. They're such opposite personalities and it seems like they're trying to fuck with each other and throw each other off.
Earwolf,372416,mondriandroid,3,Sun May 24 13:46:16 2015 UTC,"A second vote for Cordero. Went to the zoo yesterday and couldn't stop saying ""I pet a TI-ger.""   ""DE-BO-RAH! I pet a TI-ger!"""

Earwolf,372416,mrmastermustard,7,Sun May 24 05:20:19 2015 UTC,I laugh more at Sean but Hayes has introduced some of my favourite conceptual bits.

Earwolf,372416,PunkMoon,3,Sun May 24 06:04:47 2015 UTC,"What exactly does OP's ""now pls listen!"" criticism of Matt Gourley mean? Is that shorthand for something?"
Earwolf,372416,thecricketnerd,5,Sun May 24 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"That's his way of bringing it back to himself when Scott goes off on one of those famous tangents. PFT goes ""shut up for a second"" sometimes."

Earwolf,372416,changry_perdvert,14,Sun May 31 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"Nick Kroll's characters and improv skills are incredible.  I constantly relisten to the Gil Faizon and R Shrift episodes.  James Adomian, Brendon Small, Joe Wengert, Jon Gabrus, Andy Daly, and Zooks are great too.  I feel like Scopp Aukerman's improv skills are underrated. He perfectly steers his guests into madness while still kinda playing his own weird character and it takes a lot of skill to do that.  Although no one beats Sean and Hayes."
Earwolf,372416,cmurphy97,2,Sun May 24 14:04:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Nick came up with it on the spot, but the title and premise for Dentist The Mentalist was genius"
Earwolf,372416,changry_perdvert,2,Sun May 31 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"All of his shows and podcasts were brilliant.  There are so many genius moments in that whole segment, and Claudia did a great job starting bits with Kroll."
Earwolf,372416,aborted_bubble,8,Sun May 31 13:59:03 2015 UTC,James Adomian seems to have a very wide range of knowledge and uses it well.  He probably utilises it more on Todd Glass than he does on CBB though.  So I'd go with James.    Neill Campbell's freestyling is something else.  So he'd be a close second.
Earwolf,372416,Fatmanredemption,3,Sun May 24 10:42:32 2015 UTC,"When James Adomian did his Slavoj Sizek impression for nobody, I was one of those nobodies! That was the happiest I could have possibly been listening to CBB. I love his tendency to pick villains, imposing dickheads, and political weirdos he secretly agrees with as characters."
Earwolf,372416,slave_to_technology,8,Tue May 26 00:43:35 2015 UTC,"Neil Campbell, Joe Wengert, Tommy Middleditch"
Earwolf,372416,ElectricMarmalade,6,Sun May 24 04:56:29 2015 UTC,"I love Mike Hanford's Lennon, even though it's clear he doesn't know enough about the man to be performing him as a character (which makes it hilarious).  He was pretty funny as Ducky Powell also.  Jon Gabrus is great as well.  Gino comes up with some of the funniest lines I think I've ever heard in a podcast."
Earwolf,372416,randomsandwiches,5,Sun May 24 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"Zach Woods always impresses me with how quick and smart he is. That man has a way with words! And he's hilarious, of course."
Earwolf,372416,arrogantandarcane,3,Sun May 24 22:55:57 2015 UTC,yes! I wish he would come on I4H more often/CBB at all.
Earwolf,372416,Doesntgetredditatall,4,Wed May 27 05:06:01 2015 UTC,It has to be Neil Campbell. I love Lapkus and Gabrus et al but Neil is a level above.
Earwolf,372416,TheBlackSpank,6,Sun May 24 13:49:22 2015 UTC,"I could never pick an all time favorite, but Sean Clements, Andy Daly, PFT, Lauren Lapkus, Neil Campbell, and Horatio Sanz are all up there pretty high on my list.   Gun to my head, it's got to be Andy Daly, though. Scott and Zouks just actively try to rattle him, and he just spins everything into comedy gold."
Earwolf,372416,upupandbelow,2,Sun May 24 13:56:21 2015 UTC,Neil Campbell for sure and Jon Gabrus at a close second! Neil's always quick on the wit and Jon has really embraced the Gino character and regularly makes me laugh whenever he's on the show.
Earwolf,372416,mr3316,3,Sun May 24 06:47:32 2015 UTC,Neil Campbell and Mike Hanford are my favorites.
Earwolf,372416,splice_of_life,1 point,Sun May 24 12:58:49 2015 UTC,Hanford did a character called Tom Purdy that was on an early ep of CBB and the second season of the Birthday Boys.  One of my all time favorite characters.
Earwolf,372416,muddypuddy,14,Sun May 24 23:46:35 2015 UTC,"I personally dont think PFT is good at Improv. It is not his background and you can really tell when he has been on I4H he is the worst out of the people there. i think Joe Wengert, Neil Casey or Sean Conroy are the best."
Earwolf,372416,ectomimedbison,15,Sun May 24 07:04:44 2015 UTC,"Paul does really well on CBB because it fits his sensibility and he gels with Scott so well, but when he improvs in other situations it becomes clearer that he's not formally trained."
Earwolf,372416,muddypuddy,3,Sun May 24 07:31:52 2015 UTC,I agree he is great on CBB but personally to me he only shines there i do watch Speakeasy whenever a new episode comes out.

And Ho-ho!"
Earwolf,372416,fermatprime,3,Sun May 24 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"I know people have said that PFT is a really generous laugher and stuff. I know I really enjoy listening to him on podcasts, I'm sure he's just as enjoyable to have on a podcast."

Earwolf,372416,lovers_acid,3,Sun May 24 18:35:51 2015 UTC,I would have to say Nick Kroll. All of his characters are amazing at reacting to Scott and the other guests. He is also great on the fly which was cemented in the Tony Macaroni ep

Earwolf,372416,TvsPhil,2,Sun May 24 14:23:01 2015 UTC,"I have to go with Jon Gabrus simply for how amazingly quick his responses are. It feels so natural. Even guys like Andy Daly tend to go through some ""umms"" at times to find their next line(which I'm not knocking them for. It's understandable)  Gabrus seems to have some super power that makes his mind quick.   It's tough separating who I like the most as comedians and who I think is objectively good at improv. So I'll just leave it at one choice."
Earwolf,372416,cookizzamonster,2,Mon May 25 04:13:13 2015 UTC,"My faves that come to mind are Jon Daly, Tim Heidecker, and Horatio Sanz. I tend to like everything they do. And how Sanz says ""um"" too much on CBB, but it just ends up being funny."

I had a best friend in junior high he was amazing he got all of my joke. Then suddenly he moved and I didn't see him for 3yrs. I found him just another school district away so we are talking and he is telling me about all these drugs he is into now. Me being a naive little mamas boy, after our talk on the phone. I tell my mom frank is I not drugs now and can I still hang with him. Her answer was a resounding NO! Call the local sheriff and tell the police. In my mind I'm thinking that sounds reasonable, so I call the police they tell use to come in and talk. The police want to setup a sting operation on my best friend. This entire time in my head I don't understand what is happening. They make me call him with a tapped phone to meet at a Wendy's to buy a handful of weed. I am in the unmarked cop car with an undercover cop, and he ask me if I'm hungry of course I am I always am. He buys me 2 dollar burgers. I just finished the first burger when my friend arrives. I'm in the drivers seat he gets out and comes to my window. Hey man what's up we say, I missed you buddy and do you have the stuff. He pulls out a handful of weed and I take a bite out of the second burger and say great! He hands it to me I give him the money, then like in the goddamn movies 3 other police cars swarm around us. He gets slammed on the hood of my car at gunpoint. I am still eating this fucking burger while he is giving me the death stare. I slowly grab the recline handle on the seat,slowly recline to a laying position with burger in mouth till he can't see me anymore all while keeping eye contact. Best burgers of my life yo."

Earwolf,36zeqk,Sketchy_Prism,4,Sat May 23 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"We're having a welcome home/diaper party for two of my friends tonight, and by party I just mean a nerd get together. We've got a couple Xboxs set up for Halo and a GameCube for Melee and Mario tennis. It's gonna get really silly.   To join the slack chat I know we need to dm you our email but once we get in the chat can we make our own usernames or is our email our name by default? All my emails are my full name so I was going to make a throwaway one (no offense Slayner haha) but I don't want my slack name being something stupid.   As for an interesting story, when I was in high school TPing houses was like the number one thing to do. For awhile there was even TP factions and a war had broken out with people leaving their calling cards behind and everything. One night myself and three of my friends, Nate, Matt, and Luke, decided to TP a friend of ours who had graduated that year. He lived in the same small town as us and not out in the country where it was safe to TP as long as you didn't wake the people up but we decided it was worth the risk. We all piled into my old Jeep Cherokee and headed to Andrew's. We drove past his house once and saw a light on so we came up with the plan that I'd stop the car and Luke would bail out to survey the scene and see if anyone was awake in the room with the light on. I pulled up to a stop sign on the corner where Andrews house was a Luke jumped out the back. The three of us drove around the block and stopped back at the sign and waited for Luke to jump back in per the plan. He didn't show. We drove around the block again. He still didn't come back. We drove around one more time and just parked at the stop sign. Luke comes sprinting into the Jeep and yells ""get the fuck out of here man now!!"" I see headlights turning on in Andrew's neighbors' house. Not knowing why he was freaking out and being in a 25 mph zone I slowly started driving away and the new car followed me. We drove a full circle around some other block and they kept following. We decided to try and out run them so we got to the end of town and I buried the needle at 85mph flying down an old dirt road. We eventually lost them and cooled out jets at a friends place out in the country for awhile. Luke told us that someone had looked out the window at Andrews and spooked him so he ran to the neighbors house and hid amongst their old junker cars in the front yard. The neighbors had seen him run over there and thought he was breaking into their stuff and that's why they chased us. We went back to my house and thought of someone else to TP since Andrews was out of the question. My idiot friend Nate made himself a Kahlua and milk in a Taco Bell cup and grabbed a pack of gum and bottle of water that he had bought. Being the dumbass that I was I let him in the car with booze even though we were all minors.   We started heading north through town when we saw a sheriff's SUV heading our way. We quickly turned down the next road and Nate put his 3 years of Shot Put throwing to the test and jettisoned his drink into a tree in someone's yard just as the cop was turning the corner with his lights on. He ended up letting us go with a warning after we all fessed up that we were TPing. That was the last time I ever tried to throw toilet paper in someone's trees."
Earwolf,36zeqk,Sketchy_Prism,3,Sat May 23 16:26:17 2015 UTC,"Holy hell I love it. I had a couple TPing stories growing up too. Maybe on the next FTS thread I'll share my most embarrassing drunken dumbass story. I don't have time to type it all out on mobile but it's kinda similar with issues to the neighbors.   Anyway as far as slack goes, I don't blame you for not wanting your name on there, I don't want mine and I don't think anyone on there does either.   All the email is for is sending the invite you can choose any name you want in the chat. Most people just use their reddit usernames."

I've easily heard 75% of the episodes since then, and it's opened my eyes to how uncultured I was. Living in a flyover state, most of the entertainment I've been exposed to has been pig wrestling at the town buffet, but now Sean and Hayes have so nicely opened my eyes to real vibrant art like Franch feelm. I wasn't even aware of countries before HH, but now I'm a real world nerd. If podcasts is sound tv and TV is small movies, HH is The Gods Father of doing podcast"

Earwolf,36vfv1,oshoney,3,Fri May 22 16:52:18 2015 UTC,It sounds like they have her pegged down in a role that she can't really get all that outrageous with.  I'm afraid that her character will likely end up being the butt of jokes.

Earwolf,36to8e,airJordan45,-3,Fri May 22 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"I think he was just trying something different. Besser's post UCB TV career hasn't been too great.  We hold him in pretty high regard because he's a UCB forefather but before comedy nerddom was big he was taking part in zombie westerns, walsh and roberts were getting dropped from FX, and amy was a small player on SNL. edit: amy was doing pretty well.  He's got a good thing going on now but let's not blame him for trying something else for the comedy central crowd."
Earwolf,36to8e,istartriots,3,Sat May 23 03:33:39 2015 UTC,"amy was a small player on SNL   To be fair, she was the third person ever to be promoted from featured player to full cast member in their first season on the show, and became co-host of Weekend Update in her fourth year."

Earwolf,36qh0q,GiantDeviantPiano,9,Thu May 21 08:50:41 2015 UTC,"Finished the ep. Playing 7s really got Lapkus's energy up! Much more pleasant during that part.   And I love hearing Jimmy shit on Matt.   I'd love Jimmy to go on WSGLL, he often mentions how much he loves interacting with characters. I've been relistening to old Comedy Death Rays and he is indeed quite good at it. Plus who can forget the R. Shrift episode of CBB"
Earwolf,36qh0q,nohorseman,7,Thu May 21 20:38:30 2015 UTC,I want Larry on WSGLL
Earwolf,36qh0q,nyan_swanson,4,Thu May 21 23:24:12 2015 UTC,Or the blind actor. Jimmy sure has some great characters.
Earwolf,36qh0q,ELBdelorean,4,Fri May 22 00:40:01 2015 UTC,Who can forget the Lizard or Maddog.   Which might be better than a couple of the bottom-tier WSGLL hosts
Earwolf,36qh0q,nohorseman,5,Fri May 22 01:35:16 2015 UTC,I'd love Jimmy to go on WSGLL   That would (will??) be amazing.
Earwolf,36qh0q,tkdgns,7,Thu May 21 21:25:55 2015 UTC,From Jimmy's favourite show Orange is the New Black!
Earwolf,36qh0q,pbbatenatar,15,Thu May 21 08:54:35 2015 UTC,From Jimmy's favourite comedy show Orange is the New Black!
Earwolf,36qh0q,VanceFerguson,3,Thu May 21 08:56:00 2015 UTC,"They certainly have the best comedy ensemble. Better than Parks and Rec and Veep, at least."
Earwolf,36qh0q,the_the_the_,1 point,Thu May 21 18:36:49 2015 UTC,I wonder if he'll address his dislike of the show. I always appreciate his dislike of the show because I often feel alone in my strong dislike of Orange is the New Black.
Earwolf,36qh0q,jack_sjunior,14,Thu May 21 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"He likes the show, just doesn't like that it won an award for best comedy when it's a pretty far stretch to have it be labeled that."
Earwolf,36qh0q,the_the_the_,2,Thu May 21 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I dislike it, so I feel alone again."
Earwolf,36qh0q,ivtecdoyou,5,Thu May 21 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I understand not liking it.  The main character, Piper, is just as bad as Nancy Botwin was in Weeds. She's so inhumanly selfish and annoying, and takes every opportunity to do that ugly Claire Dane crying face.   The rest of the characters are generally very over the top and cheesy, which I will attribute to them being stage actors (it doesn't always translate well to screen). The stereotypes they wedge them into are so on the nose that it sometimes sucks me right out of it.  The acting drops to zero sometimes, and the lighting is SO OFF sometimes that it makes it look like a soap opera.   I like the story lines though, and I am also super attracted to Natasha Lyonne."
Earwolf,36qh0q,credibit,2,Thu May 21 16:54:43 2015 UTC,The show has tonal problems. It shifts from comedy to drama pretty inconsistently and without good transitions.

Earwolf,36qh0q,VanceFerguson,3,Thu May 21 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"I think he bailed on season 2, so I don't know saying he liked it is entirely accurate."

Earwolf,36qh0q,GeorgeTaylorG,4,Thu May 21 18:40:17 2015 UTC,This whole episode had a weirdly confrontational vibe.
Earwolf,36qh0q,Prax150,2,Sat May 23 06:24:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think the fact that Lauren had to go sit in her car for an hour may have afforded it"
Earwolf,36qh0q,Emleaux,5,Sat May 23 12:20:15 2015 UTC,I really could have gone without that 20 minute review of the Nashville concert.
Earwolf,36qh0q,rdw1809,9,Thu May 21 13:40:54 2015 UTC,It just goes to show how two men - one in his early 40s and one in his late 30s - love a network TV show about country music starring Hayden Panettiere.
Earwolf,36qh0q,bkbro,5,Thu May 21 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"I believe Matt's in his early 40's now too, he may be older than Jimmy actually."
Earwolf,36qh0q,bkbro,10,Fri May 22 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"He's like 41, I think. So the same age as Jimmy."
Earwolf,36qh0q,goofy_ball,9,Fri May 22 05:57:22 2015 UTC,Do you not listen to NNF much? That's what this show is.
Earwolf,36qh0q,nohorseman,3,Fri May 22 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't imagine a world where Jimmy and Matt go to a show like this and it takes less than 15 minutes for them to break it down."
Earwolf,36qh0q,klobbermang,3,Fri May 22 23:26:15 2015 UTC,I liked Jimmy's cowboy hat bit and image. Matt just turns the cynicism up and I want to hang myself with my earbud cord
Earwolf,36qh0q,oshoney,2,Thu May 21 15:17:41 2015 UTC,Usually I skip until the guest part but today for some reason I decided I'd listen to it. I really didn't think they'd spend the whole intro on it.

Earwolf,36oqp8,toomanylizards,5,Thu May 21 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"It's weird to realize that when I started paying attention to Letterman, he was about the same age Scott is now.  Anyone who enjoys the kind of comedy we enjoy owes a lot to Letterman. I think it's because I watched Letterman as a kid that I receive Scott & co's comedy so eagerly."
Earwolf,36oqp8,goofy_ball,9,Thu May 21 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"I love Letterman, but I'm too young to have grown up with him.  So I imagine him retiring might be comparable to when/if Scott ever ""retires"" from comedy.  I feel like since I've found CBB and Earwolf my personality, sense of humor, and worldview have changed quite a bit."
Earwolf,36oqp8,CrouchJr,6,Thu May 21 12:52:23 2015 UTC,I know what you mean. For me it will be Conan. I grew up with his late night show and then saw how the whole tonight show fiasco changed him. Oddly similar to Letterman.
Earwolf,36oqp8,weaglebeagle,2,Fri May 22 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"As I was reading the article I was kind of thinking Scott is a bit to me (and I'm sure many others) what Letterman was to him. That subversive do-whatever-you-want element that he was talking about with Letterman definitely resides within him. Comedians who get a kick out of fucking with their audience have always inspired me. I remember being enthralled by Andy Kaufman and wanting to be like him when I was a kid, he just had such balls and was clearly so intelligent and got a kick out of people not even getting what he was doing. There's just something so refreshing about that to me. That same spirit lives in Scott, and many earwolf regulars. And it really inspires me. In fact, it makes me want to get into comedy. Seriously how do I get in?"
Earwolf,36oqp8,traunks,4,Sat May 23 03:57:47 2015 UTC,love when scotty goes sincere
Earwolf,36oqp8,katiebug88,3,Thu May 21 20:05:37 2015 UTC,So awesome. My dad loved Letterman so that was who I watched and who I came to love. Now finding this connection between Letterman and all the comedians I love has been really cool. I know it most likely will not happen and is obvious but seeing or listening to Letterman and Scott interact would be anazing

Earwolf,36my8r,thewhiteafrican,9,Wed May 20 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"Brett Gelman has a voice that is instrumentally important for today's youth to hear. His stories are an insightful look at man's addictions to technology and where that will lead us in the future. I'm a fan of Scott. But to be honest, he just can't handle the truth. Sure, Brett is a little crude sometimes. But you know who else was a little ""crude""? Michelangelo. Brett has something to say and Scott is trying to censor this brilliant man. I haven't listened to Comedy Bang Bang since the lifetime ban. And I will continue to protest this show until Brett Gelman is allowed to exercise his First Amendment right without prosecution from the liberal blowhard...yeah I said it, BLOWHARD...Scott Aukerman!"

I recognize that it's sort of besides the point of the p-cast, but they literally spent 5 minutes talking about movie ratings and couldn't surmise that the reason Mad Max wasn't #1 was because it was rated R. Also 233 episodes in they don't seem to know the difference between domestic and international gross. I know this is a really nerdy thing to get ticked off at but as a movie fan it is pretty annoying. Especially since Howard clearly doesn't care about movies."

He listened to a bunch of CBB eps and said he really liked the Mantzoukas/Daly episodes, but other than that, he didn't like how crazy it gets.    He also said he thinks ""yes, and"" is dumb.

I've tried getting my family to listen to Earwolf stuff but they really aren't into podcasts. It's frustrating because I know if my dad just sat down and listened to one of these things he would love it. He's a huge Howard Stern fan, and Stern's show is basically just a primitive version of a podcast that's less funny than Earwolf stuff. Occasionally I'll tell him about something and he'll sound sufficiently interested so I'll send him a link to listen to it and he just won't get around to it. I think the big problem is that he associates podcasting with stuff like NPR and This American Life, which he hates."

Earwolf,36i0jz,plant_man,9,Tue May 19 15:59:13 2015 UTC,"Don't think you deserve downvotes for this. I've loved Weirdo Al since I was a wee lad. I think the majority of that comes from childhood nostalgia. When I was a kid and I listened to his stuff, it was just so funny and crazy because, for me, he was an introduction to the art of parody. And it was new and smart and fresh and edgy to my young mind since most funny stuff before then was physical comedy and dumb jokes. Parody, however, is a style that can begin to feel a bit dated since it's so reference dependent and time sensitive. And as we get older and our tastes refine, it can start to feel linear and sorta hollow. That being said, I think Al is a genius at what he does. I think he's a comedy treasure because he has maintained an insanely high quality of work over an even more insane length of time. In comedy, you're lucky to get a few good years out of a career. He's gotten fucking decades on decades. In what most consider a trite, hacky subgenre. Like him or not, you can't deny how good he is at elevating his artform. I mean, he even limits himself to PG humor and still manages to write stuff that is so clever as to be near universally revered. Further, he is one of the most gracious people in entertainment. He seems to truly, truly love and respect his fans. And there are countless stories of him going out of his way to do right by them. He's just the epitome of what a celebrity should be.   Now, I don't really listen to his music anymore. I feel like I've sorta outgrown it and that breaks my heart a little bit. But that's okay. There are new kids everyday discovering and falling in love with this truly awesome individual. And whether or not he ever becomes 'my thing' again, he will always have my adoration and respect for the part he played in helping me and countless others find some joy on the long, sad, lonely road of adolescence."

Also, check out old episodes of The Reality Show Show. I really don't care much about reality TV, but I've been absorbing as much Hayes and Sean as I can, and it's still really entertaining. It's also kind of nice to listen to them when they're not in character. They'll still go into bits at times, but a lot of The Reality Show Show is just them earnestly discussing the shows they love. If I had known how good it was when it was still going, I would have watched every show they talked about right along with them, but it's still hilarious even without having watched them."

And isn't it good when they have clips that is make people laugh? But Sean was on point.  Also, shout out to Debra Subway for birthing the best HH engineer."
Earwolf,36guab,mitchwinner,3,Wed May 20 02:27:54 2015 UTC,"I loved this episode. I think my problem with HH before has been that I never had the stamina to listen to a full ep before, I usually stopped at half an hour or so. If I knew how many good games / bits there were on HH I would have stuck around more before. Plus it seems like it takes a while to be acquainted with the characters Sean and Hayes play, and maybe blindly listening to an episode isn't the best way to do that. I'm sure moving forward that new Earwolf fans will more easily enjoy HH because of this ep.

Earwolf,36fnka,lapsedlurker,42,Tue May 19 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Honestly for the first couple weeks I thought it was a quick running joke and it would be over by the next one. When I realized he meant to keep running with it for a bit longer, I was pretty proud of it--I had only hoped he would read one of my dopey suggestions on air, and given the numerous funnier catchphrases he's gone through I'm pretty sure he just picked at random.  The wind has kind of been taken out of my sails, though--a few hours ago a forum poster (AxeD) pointed out that back in October there was a pretty identical catchphrase suggestion from Phrancis Phord Coppla. I haven't been able to find an episode where it was read as the catchphrase yet, but if it was then I clearly subconsciously picked up on the catchphrase from there.  Page where it was pointed out  PPC's post  My 'Sally Sells' suggestion  So now I'm just kind of bummed about the whole thing. I knew it probably wasn't a terribly original premise since it's such a common expression, but the close structures of the two catchphrases make me think that at the very least we probably both got it from some third piece of media.  Further googling brought me to this tumblr post from a year ago that has the same structure as well. I know I didn't actively plagiarize anyone, since that would honestly be the most pathetic plagiarism of all time, but the other options are 1.) subconscious borrowing or 2.) basic unoriginality.  Anyway, it was a treat for the last 4 weeks, and whether or not he switches it up it's been a fun ride. Half the point of submitting anything was to try to get him to say Bronson Magnifico anyway."
Earwolf,36fnka,BronsonMagnifico,9,Tue May 19 01:34:55 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't sweat it! I think of it as like sending a hot chick to the crowded bar to get your drinks, knowing she'll get quicker service. We all just want good catchphrases, and your grade A username helped it get the attention.  A related argument: It's not ""original catchphrase submission"" it's just like requesting a song at a DJ booth.  We're all proud of you and your place in podcast history.

Earwolf,36cg4t,TOMMPTTTC,18,Mon May 18 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"And they killed it too. The first part was a little slow and I sorta got the vibe that Hayes and Sean were nervous. Then, after the break it was just home run after home run. This ep was pretty much a perfect hybrid of both shows."
Earwolf,36cg4t,sevillianrites,10,Mon May 18 19:21:04 2015 UTC,I preferred the conversation before the break!  Just hilarious quick-wittedness.

Earwolf,36cg4t,klobbermang,27,Tue May 19 19:15:45 2015 UTC,That picture makes me so unbelievably happy. It's hard for me not to frame this as a Hollywood Handbook episode where our golden boys go on CBB... Especially after seeing that pic
Earwolf,36cg4t,WhosCountin,20,Mon May 18 08:44:00 2015 UTC,They should release an episode of just commentary on this episode.
Earwolf,36cg4t,ivtecdoyou,16,Mon May 18 11:51:47 2015 UTC,Time for a return of the classic segment Riff’rent Strokes for Different Jokes: Comedy Burn! Burn! Edition.

Earwolf,36cg4t,TorturouslyOkay,31,Tue May 19 20:21:01 2015 UTC,5 minutes in and already the best episode ever  Edit: Finished the episode.  Irrefutable evidence that Sean and Hayes are the funniest people of all time.
Earwolf,36cg4t,changry_perdvert,5,Mon May 18 13:01:24 2015 UTC,Also of all space.
Earwolf,36cg4t,tkdgns,6,Tue May 19 18:49:10 2015 UTC,As a new listener to HH and Sean/Hayes... Which of the two keeps mini-snorting with laughter?
Earwolf,36cg4t,Mr_Viper,16,Tue May 19 07:04:51 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive it's both, but I think Hayes does it the most."
Earwolf,36cg4t,siriusthinking,5,Tue May 19 12:39:35 2015 UTC,Hayes is the bigger snorter.
Earwolf,36cg4t,sevillianrites,4,Wed May 20 16:10:52 2015 UTC,"As awesome as this episode was. A major highlight was hearing Saves the Day, even if it was for 10 seconds."
Earwolf,36cg4t,Goldsmifff,17,Wed May 20 00:32:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll finally begin to understand all the Sean and Hayes hype around here. Listened to two HH eps awhile back and was meh about it, but I have enjoyed their recent CBB ads."

Earwolf,36cg4t,ill-cozby,10,Tue May 19 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"I was the same way, but I just decided to go back and start HH from the beginning, definitely helped. The biggest difference is getting used to the hosts being the characs instead of wacky charac guests. Took some getting used to but once you do, their host characters are hilarious!"
Earwolf,36cg4t,SirPribsy,1 point,Mon May 18 11:28:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I can't get behind their podcast, but love their adds on CBB. Pretty pumped for this ep!"
Earwolf,36cg4t,pizzamarie,7,Mon May 18 10:44:23 2015 UTC,"I also don't ""get""  their podcast,  and their ads on CBB have been hard for me to listen to.  I really tried to like Hollywood Handbook because it is so highly recommended but after ten episodes I had to stop downloading them. Still subscribed, just have auto download turned off."
Earwolf,36cg4t,jacabo,9,Mon May 18 11:13:20 2015 UTC,I was like you and /u/pizzamarie once. Now I'm spending about an hour a day updating the dang wiki. It'll click for ya both
Earwolf,36cg4t,nohorseman,2,Mon May 18 14:01:10 2015 UTC,"I'm finally getting caught back up to my normal rotation after taking my harris memorial relisten detour. After I listen to this episode today, if it does click, I'll try and go back and listen to all of HH."
Earwolf,36cg4t,jacabo,6,Mon May 18 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"I did the same, downloaded a bunch, listened to 2 whole and 1/2 of at least 5, can't get into it. They do seem funny though. Just not in their podcast format - to me anyway."
Earwolf,36cg4t,pizzamarie,5,Mon May 18 13:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah it took me around 10 or so before it clicked. I thought it was super boring before then. I think my issue was I listened to the show in my car and I'm prone to sorta spacing out, which is not a good mindset for HH because its a ridiculously dry/subtle show. There's a lot that's sorta implied under the surface that you're gonna miss if you're not focused. I'd recommend just occasionally going through eps of guests you like. That's how I did it. It really is worthwhile if you can just get past that ridiculous entry level."
Earwolf,36cg4t,sevillianrites,9,Mon May 18 15:26:12 2015 UTC,"YES! Can't wait to listen to this! It could be an hour and a half of ads for all I care, I wouldn't mind.  edit: ""Now I'm reading Pogo."" God damn, Hayes was on fire this ep. I love all their newspaper comic references."
Earwolf,36cg4t,WhosCountin,12,Mon May 18 07:41:31 2015 UTC,"This is the most excited I've been for a CBB ep since I started listening to Hollywood Handbook a month or so ago. This actually might be the first one I've listened to besides the anniversary special since I've pretty much switched over to all HH all the time. I'm an avid listener, maybe even for a whole year"
Earwolf,36cg4t,TvsPhil,6,Mon May 18 08:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, between some of the comments here and the Earwolf forums about this episode, I'm incredibly confused.  I'm sure they're all inside jokes but all together and it's like I'm reading a different language. This must be what it feels like to hear things like ""C+ episode"", ""Iiiittt's been..."" and ""Larry Mullen Sr's son"""

Earwolf,36cg4t,arlencanhang,3,Tue May 19 18:29:10 2015 UTC,Time to get on the HH hype train!
Earwolf,36cg4t,FirstFuego,7,Tue May 19 15:31:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Harris Wittels was only vaguely on my radar before he died. Perhaps this is the reason why I got so heavily into all his shit after he died, and why I haven't been able to stop grieving about it. Until now.  Somehow, Scott's off-handed incorporation of the Foam Corner theme into this episode was exactly what I needed. I feel I am finally able to fully move past the sadness of Harris's death, and to remember him in as pleasant a light as I can assume he would want."
Earwolf,36cg4t,notalek,5,Mon May 18 23:34:21 2015 UTC,Was I missing something with the Andrew Ti bit or was it just a ribbing?
Earwolf,36cg4t,ihavepoliosis,15,Mon May 18 13:59:29 2015 UTC,He's got maybe the least popular regularly released Earwolf podcast. They were joking that he's actually the real boss of Earwolf. It really didn't sound like more than just having fun.
Earwolf,36cg4t,notalek,5,Mon May 18 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he'll do an episode on this podcast, since they mentioned him and it kinda had some race based jokes."
Earwolf,36cg4t,sevillianrites,3,Mon May 18 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"That reminds me of the most recent live CBB with Kroll. It was pretty funny that once he was doing El Chupa in front of a live audience, he realized how offensive it was and immediately called himself on it."
Earwolf,36cg4t,TheBlackSpank,7,Tue May 19 15:28:05 2015 UTC,Mmm yes. I hope Scott doesn't make them play that awful would you ravver segment. Sean still seems like he's smarting from PFT being such a mean person and didn't we all lose so much respect for him for being that to him?
Earwolf,36cg4t,JW_Stillwater,6,Mon May 18 07:45:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've never seen Tom Paulkins get so scary. He was acting like some kind of Frankingstein. I was ready to get a few licks in on him myself to protect Sean."

Earwolf,36cg4t,Condawg,-2,Mon May 18 15:27:02 2015 UTC,"Long-time CBB fan here, and I feel the same. I've grown kind of bored with the show's recent tendency to rely on ""random nonsense said in a weird cadence"" for laughs; considering that this is basically the whole of the HH guys' schtick, this ep is pretty arduous to slog through. I'm okay being in the minority on this, but the whole thing feels self-satisfied and, again, kind of boring."
Earwolf,36cg4t,VernacularRobot,14,Tue May 19 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"ERR, WRONG! It's actually NOT self-satisfied and is super entertaining and educational and cool."

Earwolf,36cg4t,catch_th3m_all,-24,Tue May 19 18:50:01 2015 UTC,hopefully now that they've had their episode the ads will stop
Earwolf,36cg4t,ThorgrimWolfsgaar,26,Mon May 18 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yes I also enjoy plain vanilla ads. In fact I mostly listen to podcasts FOR the ads. And it bothers me to no end when people  make the ads into some sort of hilarious, entertaining, romp rather than the dull, groan inducing forced act break they are meant to be! I mean, why make something fun when it can be super boring instead!"
Earwolf,36cg4t,sevillianrites,1 point,Mon May 18 21:32:54 2015 UTC,I agree.
Earwolf,36cg4t,cryptogrammar,-1,Tue May 19 00:20:36 2015 UTC,Why is this being downvoted?
Earwolf,36cg4t,thejjar,13,Mon May 18 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but for me it just doesn't make sense conceptually. It's an ad. In my experience most people either skip the ads or zone out for them. Why? Because they're boring as fuck. No matter who is reading them with what flourishes generally, they are exactly the same. So complaining about Hayes and Sean doing bits during the ads is like..complaining about there being too many fights in Hockey or too few grind related quests in an MMO. This shit is there to break the monotony.  To make something dull a little less so.   But even given THAT, the comment sounds dicky. There are ways you can phrase a dislike for something without sounding vaguely inflammatory.  No one says you have to like HH. In fact, I'll upvote a comment about disliking HH as long as OP respects the fact that other people do like it. Something along the lines of ""I'm not a huge fan of these guys because (X)."" or ""It's just not my thing because (y)."" That's totally fair. It's not for everyone. And comments like that engender empathy and respect. I'm not a huge Andy Daly fan, but you don't see me going on his CBB ep threads and saying shit like ""hopefully when Andy Daly's CC show starts back up, he'll be too busy to be on CBB anymore."" People love that dude and I respect that they do and I see why. He's just not for me.  And finally, that account is an alt. So whoever posted that comment likely posted it to intentionally be inflammatory and troll people. That was probably my biggest reason for downvoting it.  Guess I shoulda lead with that!"
Earwolf,36cg4t,Virginonimpossible,2,Mon May 18 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100%, except when you say that its an alt account. I assume you are reaching that conclusion based on the fact that he's been a redditor for five months and that is his first-ever comment. But how do you know he isn't just a lurker?"
Earwolf,36cg4t,Slayner,7,Mon May 18 23:12:09 2015 UTC,CAUSE THE ADS SHOULD NEVER STOP
Earwolf,36cg4t,changry_perdvert,2,Mon May 18 21:16:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's just me, but for me the ads are a close second for favourite segment after the What's Up Hot Dog Memorial Plugs Section."

Earwolf,36cg4t,credibit,0,Tue May 19 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"Great episode, probably shouldn't win ""best of"" this year, probably will because HH fans are, uh, devoted."
Earwolf,36cg4t,klobbermang,3,Tue May 19 00:31:37 2015 UTC,I think it'll be hard to top Abelson and Sixth anniversary. Plus last year's holiday special is eligible I believe
Earwolf,36cg4t,georgeoscarbluth,4,Tue May 19 18:47:13 2015 UTC,My guess is that it will not. If the voting system is the same as last year you don't rank the episodes you just select X episodes. I doubt that we HH fans are capricious enough not to select other good episodes for the sake of advancing this one.

I really hope he becomes a regular, he's got an off kilter brand of comedy that fits right into the show.  Watching him errr, not so gracefully, but organically fall into a character was very entertaining.  Although, I can see where some folks might shrug off this approach as being unprepared..., I don't.  Maybe it's just me, but for me I like it!"

Earwolf,36bfx2,Quinez,9,Mon May 18 07:25:39 2015 UTC,"June says all sorts of hilarious stuff and Jason ribs her for being kookoo, but I think she is genuinely a perceptive film watcher.  She does not shrug off weird choices that the film makes: she takes them at face value and tries to understand the film from its own perspective.  She doesn't gloss over things that a movie tries to get you to gloss over.  There's a lot of comedy to be milked from doing this.  ""What is a Street Fighter?"" is a hilarious question, but it's also a good question that the movie tries to sweep under the rug.  She's also really good at reading which elements of an actor's performance are choices and which are due to incompetent acting.  Paul and Jason just tend to lump everything under an umbrella heading of ""bad acting"".    And she's also good at noticing wigs!  That said, sometimes she just plain misreads movie (usually because she could not care less about the movies, I think).  The misreading about the birthday candles in After Earth is a case in point.  Paul and Jason act as if all of June's zaniness is due to an inability to understand a movie, but it's not.  Usually, her questions are actually hilariously insightful.  Usually, June is on point.  She's the real star of the podcast, IMO."

Earwolf,369uii,nicemaker,28,Sun May 17 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"What I always loved about Neil Campbell is that he can be so funny while also being clean and kind of childish. I always view his characters as innocent...like Pee Wee Herman. With his whimsical and silly mind, it's no wonder that Scott hired him as the head writer for the TV show."
Earwolf,369uii,jpatton89,11,Sun May 17 18:25:26 2015 UTC,I get that same child-like innocence from a lot of Scott's humor. I've always loved seeing grown adults carry that childhood silliness that most people lose into adulthood.
Earwolf,369uii,traunks,3,Sun May 17 20:06:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love how uncomfortable Scott can get at some of the more blue humor that pops up, ""Hey, this isn't that kind of show!"" Sure, it's partly a joke on his part, but I think there's some truth to it when you get a good understanding of what his personal humor is like."
Earwolf,369uii,gladvillain,5,Mon May 18 07:00:30 2015 UTC,"Nah, Scott's personal sense of humor is very blue.  UTU2TM is closer to his genuine sense of humor than CBB, and other podcast hosts have read texts from him that are way beyond anything he'd say on one of his podcasts.  He's just a professional and he knows that there is a difference between ""house humor"" and humor for public consumption.  Bob Odenkirk taught him this, as he explained in that recent Pedestran interview:   When I first got that job as a writer, I was like “oh good, let’s do offensive comedy!” and I still think it’s really funny when people curse in the middle of sketches for no reason or whatever. But there was a lot of stuff that we would do around the office that was just offensive; ‘house’ comedy- it’s funny around the house but don’t put it on stage or on TV. And I would say we should do it on the show, and Bob would say “Why would we do it? What’s the purpose behind it? What are we trying to say?”. He never wanted to put out something offensive without having a reason to back it up. For example, ""I’m saying this because I’m trying to make a satirical point about people in positions of power, and I’m not just making fun of people who are less than me""."
Earwolf,369uii,Quinez,4,Mon May 18 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"Good point. I guess I just hold CBB Scott in my head as default Scott since that is how I have come to ""know"" him most. I even remember loving the antagonistic side of him we got to see in Analyze Phish, and he definitely has a different vibe on UTU2TM. I concede to your well thought out analysis."

Earwolf,369uii,gladvillain,3,Sun May 17 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"I love that Matt ended the scene with a ""Holy Shit"" after Neil said that.  Usually Matt is very good at never ever commenting on the quality of a scene after it's done.  (That surprised me at first... I thought that a lot of scenes deserved a pat on the back after they were done.  But I realized later that it's really professional.  If some scenes get props, the ones that don't get props seem like they're ones the players thought less of.  Plus, it's annoyingly metatextual.  Matt's even good at shutting down other players when they start doing it.)  The ""Clit's Alive!"" from the recent 4/20 episode also got a ""Holy Shit"" from Matt.  Any others?"

A notable mention goes to the character he played with Zach Galafinakis (spelling?) and Jon Daly from a few years ago, where he details the play the he wrote titled ""Quackers Featherbeak's Coo-Coo Caper.""  I got to see him perform a bit that he did with CBB live in Austin a couple years ago with Martin Starr and Paul Scheer.  It was one of the funniest things I've ever gotten to see, about a fictitious disease called Gart.  He also did a monologue at that show that was really stellar, too.  Neil is the man."

Campbell and Paul Rust do strangely innocent silliness better than anyone else. There's a real sense of unbridled glee in his performances. He's always solid on improv4humans too."
Earwolf,369uii,HipGuide,3,Sun May 17 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished watching the CBB VPN episode with Jeff Ross, Ron Sexsmith, ""Sarah Silverman"", and Neil Campbell as author Cam Bilmoth: https://youtu.be/Dt0qnC9ofn4 Neil always manages to kill with subdued, understated characters, even in a room with louder personalities.  My personal favorite episode with Neil is the ""Poehler Ice Caps"" episode with Amy Poehler and PFT. All the guests in this episode feed off each other so well (I especially love the utter delight PFT has with Neil, especially during his freestyle rap)."
Earwolf,369uii,TheBlackSpank,3,Sun May 17 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"My favorite bits of his are:  -The Rick Faber stories of running into a guy in his 30s who seems an awful lot like Neil Campbell.  -His Halloween one man show about a psychopath whose favorite word was ""bugs"" and loved R.L. Stine's Fear Street series over the Goosebumps series as they were for an older crowd.  -Stories about Mordor go fifth in the ordor. -The Time Keeper  There's something in every appearance that I like. He doesn't get a ton of time to explore characters I don't THINK. Could just be my opinion. Maybe he doesn't plan them to be long term, recurring characters with deep backstories like Cake Boss but who knows. Rick Faber has returned a few times but generally his bit the same. Which is fine. It's funny. The Bachelor Brothers have returned but the canon is a bit jumbled. Which is fine. It's funny and works for Neil and Paul.  I'd like to see him take a character like the Time Keeper and bring him back to explore and create a funny backstory. If not that character, then another. He could do it and it'd be cool to see Neil rise in the ranks of CBB guests."

Earwolf,368wzw,BentleyCarr,1 point,Mon May 18 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"I have been saying for a little while now that the podcast has really picked up their game as of late. The episodes for Junior and after, going forward have all been very strong. I was nervous going to the show that these episodes, for SUCH bad movies, might not hold up to say, the Con Air or Face Off episodes, which were brilliant. I'm so happy to say that I was worried for absolutely no reason. I went to both, they were both incredible. I had an amazing time, too many highlights count. So glad i walked away with one of the Nundercover posters. It was so dark in Irving Plaza and i got home so late, it wasn't until the next day that I got to really enjoy all the details on the poster.    The only two things I was disappointed at were that: 1. I could have sworn that by the end of the night, either Jason, June, Paul or someone with a good Q would have put forward the idea that Pretzie and Keno (both NY'ers) were somehow related. 2. That I didn't get around to asking the question of which Vanilla Ice vehicle will they be watching next, in order to complete the 'Van Winkle Trifecta'.    All 3 hosts were at the top of their game, and both Abbi Jacobson and Adam Pally were hilarious. FIVE STARS."

The least expensive snack served at the theatre would often be peanuts, which the patrons would sometimes throw at the performers on stage to show their disapproval. The phrases ""no comments from the peanut gallery"" or ""quiet in the peanut gallery"" are extensions of the name.   In the late 1940s the Howdy Doody children's television show adopted the name to represent its audience of children.

Earwolf,35zvtl,angelfromthecoast,19,Thu May 14 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"little boy                                           But he wanted very much to be a big boy, right?"
Earwolf,35zvtl,nettski,15,Thu May 14 22:36:19 2015 UTC,Hey!  They had a Closing Up the Mailbag theme!
Earwolf,35zvtl,tkdgns,5,Fri May 15 00:23:29 2015 UTC,That's a good song!
Earwolf,35zvtl,ral315,5,Fri May 15 02:29:01 2015 UTC,That is a good song.
Earwolf,35zvtl,mullacc,4,Fri May 15 03:38:13 2015 UTC,That song's okay.

Earwolf,35zvtl,jpatton89,6,Fri May 15 02:11:46 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking. I actually kind of feel bad for Scott Aukerman. I know that David Letterman is a huge comedy inspiration and he never had a chance to be on his show. And now he never will. In fact, now that I think about it. Has Scott ever been on ANY late night program? As big a fan of late night TV he is, you'd think he'd always try to get on them. He personally knows so many of the writers, warm-up acts, and hosts/co-hosts of late night TV, I wonder why he never goes on them? Has Scott ever talked about this before?"
Earwolf,35zvtl,thornset,3,Fri May 15 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"He was on Seth Meyers several months back, but I think that's about it so far. I'm always hoping to see him on Conan myself, but network wise that might be a step down from Meyers? (not in my eyes of course)"
Earwolf,35zvtl,PDCchewie88,2,Fri May 15 07:38:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe with his schedule cleared Dave can find his way to CBBTV? Doubtful, I know, but it would be a great thing I'd it happened...."
Earwolf,35zvtl,nyan_swanson,1 point,Fri May 15 16:13:30 2015 UTC,He could play Fred Armisen's replacement on the TV at Night Show.
Earwolf,35zvtl,klobbermang,1 point,Sat May 16 06:41:48 2015 UTC,He's only famous to a pretty small segment of people
Earwolf,35zvtl,jpatton89,2,Fri May 15 11:51:18 2015 UTC,"Right. But he has a television show. He could have used that as his excuse to get on for a few years, now. I watch conan every night. I've seen plenty of guests who are less famous than Scott as the second interview."
Earwolf,35zvtl,ReliableSource,1 point,Fri May 15 14:03:31 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who feels like the bit didn't really go anywhere? Like, ok, she was on the phone asking if everyone else was married, and I was wondering where it would lead, then she said yes and Andy left. It was like an anti-bit"
Earwolf,35zvtl,archobler,7,Fri May 15 14:38:33 2015 UTC,That IS the bit. She'd only agree to marry him once she checked to see if anyone else was available.

Earwolf,35yuwr,tkdgns,7,Thu May 14 17:39:42 2015 UTC,"Sometimes someone will do a character and within two sentences they’ll say their really weird thing. And it’s such a leap that it’s difficult for an audience to go with them- because we’re just getting settled in.    Immediately thought of HP-DP-69B (Little Button Puss) sex robot.   Edit and this :    It gets me upset when fans actively tweet negative comments to guests. When I have someone new on the podcast and they don’t deliver whatever the fan expectations are, they get really mad and say “That person didn’t play along ""right"" or “That person wasn’t as funny as…”. How terrible is that, to be an entertainer, get asked to do a podcast you’ve never done before, show up, have a good time and then start receiving messages from fans that you sucked. Or when people just directly tweet at me that they don’t like this week’s episode. Every single episode is going to have people who hate it, so how does that make me feel, every Monday, dreading a podcast coming out because I know I’m going to get several messages saying “hey this one sucked”. I mean I know it’s my 'job' technically, but I do it because I love comedy. I know when an episode doesn’t work. But I’m still going to put it out. What would you rather me do, just have no episode that week?   I know hoping that fans don't do this on the forums, or here, or twitter is basically asking the internet not to be the internet, but I can't imagine how tiresome it can become for them. ""Oh user boner69 doesn't like X guest or this weeks episode ! Alert the presses ! Thanks for letting us all know !"""

Earwolf,35xgc0,beisbol_por_siempre,9,Thu May 14 09:29:03 2015 UTC,I think it's so funny that those elephants in Dumbo reminded Matt of Wild Horses so he showed them the clip and immediately forced them to play the elephants before they could complain about the comparison.  And they did a pretty pitch-perfect imitation.
Earwolf,35xgc0,Quinez,5,Thu May 14 13:47:21 2015 UTC,Their imitation was pretty damn spot on. That and the Little Mermaid scene were hilarious.
Earwolf,35xgc0,oshoney,2,Thu May 14 17:07:44 2015 UTC,Who was Ariel? Erin? That voice was spot on
Earwolf,35xgc0,nohorseman,1 point,Thu May 14 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"My favorite scene since the naming the royal baby one with Gemberling last year. I don't understand how amazing and energetic the Wildhorses are on I4H yet only Lapkus seem to really hit on CBB. Is it the format, or is Scott just a bad match for their personalities.  They seem the thrive when things get crazy, but play flat normal characters on CBB.  Though I suppose it does speak to how ace Besser is at bringing out the best in fellow improvisers."
Earwolf,35xgc0,stenchwinslow,2,Sat May 16 16:26:36 2015 UTC,I thought Mary and Erin were pretty great on CBB in the Tom Green episode before it got really weird

Earwolf,35xgc0,JasmineForsythe,2,Thu May 14 12:39:57 2015 UTC,Are they singing the Rolling Stones version of Wild Horses or the Sundays cover?

The show needed more Gabrus and less of everything else.  Like maybe instead of a shitty game show, they make the people who walk into the barber shop do improv instead."
Earwolf,35y4n8,stenchwinslow,3,Sat May 16 12:25:19 2015 UTC,I have so much goodwill for Gabrus from I4H that I'd support anything he does. Hugely talented guy.

It's wild how I believe they know what they're talking about, even though they clearly don't. I catch myself saying ""heey that sounds pretty good."" Their announcer voices are powerful things. And I'm a pretty big basketball fan.   Also when Matt finds out about Amanda's injury in ep 3 it was the sweetest dang thing I ever heard. It's also extremely cute whenever she checks into the game at all. A wonderful subplot to every episode.   Anyone who has ever thought something to the effect of ""I could listen to Matt Gourley riff off the phone book"" owes it to themselves to check this out."
Earwolf,35s26j,nohorseman,7,Wed May 13 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Gourley fan and haven't heard of PSR, could you give me a brief description of what the show is?"
Earwolf,35s26j,unholypencil,9,Wed May 13 05:08:04 2015 UTC,There is a female comedian recreational basketball league in LA and a team (the Pistol Shrimps) has quite a few earwolf regulars including Gourley's girlfriend (Amanda Lund). So Gourley and Mcconville decided to provide play-by-play of the team's games this season as a podcast and it is hilariously perfect.

The show is Matt and Mark McConnville bring a folding table and dress in linen sport coats, set it up and provide only audio commentary, while knowing next to nothing about basketball. Basically an excuse to improvise and riff.   The games are Tuesday nights and the show goes up Wednesday mornings at the latest, there are 3 episodes so far with the 4th coming probably in an hour or so. Colin Hanks joined the guys on the third ep.   EDIT nm the fourth ep went up 8 hours ago!"
Earwolf,35s26j,HearnsHouse,3,Wed May 13 13:08:02 2015 UTC,So funny!  I noticed some chemistry between Amanda Fun Buns Lund (the secret weapon) and Matt...
Earwolf,35s26j,TvsPhil,3,Wed May 13 13:04:28 2015 UTC,I love it. I'm a huge basketball fan in general and this is just great.
Earwolf,35s26j,Gercke,3,Wed May 13 21:36:31 2015 UTC,"I do now. It was a strange path to take getting to my awareness of the team. Watching Comedy Bang Bang and Googling Angela Trimbur like a creep after that episode with Kid Cudi. This led to me internally asking ""Why does she look familiar?  I must've seen her in something else."" Well I didn't figure that out but she led to the Pistol Shrimps/L.A. Municipal Dance Squad and then later, an encyclopedic compendium podcast of women's rec league basketball appeared involving comedians I really like.  And that's the story.  I'm describing the podcast as the UTU2TM of women's rec league basketball. Not to anyone else. Just myself...and you guys."
Earwolf,35s26j,Dax_Webster,2,Fri May 15 12:43:54 2015 UTC,PSR reminds me a lot of UTU2TM. Like there is something to be said about two friends just doing something for shits and literal giggles with no higher purpose at all.

Earwolf,35r9kg,RyansPodcastReviews,13,Tue May 12 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"The one bit I liked was when Matt Walsh got attacked by the baby seals. That was pretty funny.  Someone pointed out that there was a lot of ""retard"" humor. There really was a lot. The scene at the party (where Paul Scheer's character brings all the people claiming insurance to attack his boss or whatever) is an obvious example.  The whole time that scene was happening, I was just uncomfortable. I kept thinking of something PFT said, which was basically ""The question isn't whether you should be allowed to say 'retarded', the question is why do you want to?"" And I think they just wanted to make fun of people with mental disabilities. And I didn't enjoy that.  I know they were trying to be wildly offensive and subversive, but I think they failed. They were less subversive than South Park or GTA, which are both incredibly mainstream and popular.  The craziest character in the script was played by Jason Mantzoukas, who did a really good job at playing a less-interesting version of any Jason Mantzoukas improv character.  ALSO I haven't listened to episode 4 yet, but I'm assuming Paul ends up with Lauren Lapkus? Because that seemed to be very obviously where it was heading in episode 1, and in episode 2 and episode 3 that subplot developed exactly like I expected it would."
Earwolf,35r9kg,ksaid1,7,Wed May 13 04:06:11 2015 UTC,"A tangential rant but I think it's important: it's not subverting anything if the joke isn't on the people saying the offensive shit. The line there is something both comedians and comedy fans seem to miss a lot of the time (and the fact that the primary demographic of both is straight, white men with no mental health issues outside of maybe anxiety/depression plays into this, if you aren't a part of the oppressed group that is being made fun of then maybe it's not your place to say it's not offensive and that people who don't laugh are just being too sensitive).  I'm of the firm opinion that nothing is off topic in comedy, but how you frame a joke with a ""controversial"" subject is absolutely critical to making it funny. Making fun of people with mental health problems, or gay people, or non-white people, or women, or whatever isn't edgy and it's ridiculous to me that that's the word we use to describe that type of ""humor."" Perpetuating stereotypes and upholding the status quo is not edgy or subversive, it's the Fox News of comedy. Saying ""r*tard"" as a punchline, even as hyperbole, is not edgy unless you're using satire to skewer the person saying it and make it obvious why it isn't actually edgy, funny or interesting at all. How you frame a joke matters. If there's no context and it's just the same, boring slur used for shock value, then it's not funny. I didn't listen to this whole thing, but it was pretty clear to me that if there was intent for satire, it was not executed well."
Earwolf,35r9kg,fireswater,2,Thu May 14 00:53:26 2015 UTC,Nailed. it.
Earwolf,35r9kg,stepintomyofficebaby,2,Thu May 14 14:14:14 2015 UTC,Yup. I stopped listening after the party scene.
Earwolf,35r9kg,wikais,6,Wed May 13 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"I listened to 3 of 4 episodes but didn't really pay attention enough to know the story. For some reason, for the scenes that I did pay attention to, I visualized them all in the style of GTA5, which I have never even played and have only watched being played briefly. It was probably because of the seediness of it all.  I almost unsubscribed after part 4 was released, but decided to wait until the next screenplay."
Earwolf,35r9kg,ksaid1,5,Wed May 13 01:20:49 2015 UTC,"Yes! GTA was exactly what I thought of, too. Which made me confused how Leonard kept going on about ""this script is so insane! whoa!"" I was like, GTA V was easily as crazy as this and it made a billion dollars immediately."
Earwolf,35r9kg,VanceFerguson,2,Wed May 13 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"As a video game nerd, I would say it's closer to Saints Row than GTA."
Earwolf,35r9kg,ksaid1,2,Wed May 13 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"yeah true there was some stuff that was too heightened for GTA, like the baby seals thing.  but I think Paul Scheer's character is, like, spot-on a regular guy turning into Trevor from GTA V"
Earwolf,35r9kg,Space_Wanderer,10,Thu May 14 03:08:40 2015 UTC,I listened to the first 20 or so minutes and I couldn't continue. That script just is trying to be as edgy as it possibley can be and its annoying. It almost seemed like a bit from Hollywood Handbook because of how hard it was trying to be fuckin cool and subversive or whatever. Bummer.
Earwolf,35r9kg,nrkist2424,1 point,Wed May 13 00:04:38 2015 UTC,"I think that's the point.  They are mocking these scripts?  All the people involved in Ball's Out episodes are just too funny and smart.  Despite how earnestly they discuss this script like it's the freakin bible of comedy (which it obviously isn't) and how earnest their performances are, and the production level and sound-effects, it's devastatingly terrible and the anti-thesis of comedy.  I think that's the point?  Still not enjoyable to listen to on that level though...and to be fair, trying equally as hard to be as hip and edgy as the script they are deriding."
Earwolf,35r9kg,EYESoftheHAWK,5,Sun Jun 14 11:07:58 2015 UTC,"I wanted to like it so bad. The cast was great, the script was hyped, and I had a reasonable hope that I'd like it because it's on Wolfpop. And I did, for a minute at least, if only because I gave the over-the-top vulgarity of it all a pass. But after the third retard joke (early on, btw), I understood why the writers' agents refused to send it out; it was oh-so-edgy, but nothing new and not very good."
Earwolf,35r9kg,Steapenhyll,2,Wed May 13 13:13:19 2015 UTC,I've actually been generally disappointed with the Wolfpop content that I've tried.
Earwolf,35r9kg,Quinez,1 point,Wed May 13 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"The Canon is truly fantastic.  It's really great movie conversation by two people who are knowledgeable, opinionated, and unique.  And they're clearly good friends who love giving each other shit.  I Was There Too is often pretty good.  But everything else is a dud, IMO."
Earwolf,35r9kg,Steapenhyll,1 point,Thu May 14 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"I like listening to episodes of The Canon when I've seen the film, but that's not often enough since I'm not a movie buff. I eventually unsubscribed because I was skipping so many episodes.  I have listened to I Was There Too when I like the movie they're discussing ... but that podcast has limited appeal I think, and I've never subscribed to it.  I did give Maltin on Movies a shot for a while, but Leonard Maltin and his co-host just don't really have the chemistry I'm looking for ... and once again I'm not a movie buff.  One problem I see with Wolfpop is that as Hollywood-centric as Earwolf is, Wolfpop shows crank that to 11. I don't need as much entertainment industry content as either of these podcast networks put out."
Earwolf,35r9kg,scorpiondeathlock,3,Thu May 14 11:30:57 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm in the minority that really enjoyed this. I think the joke was that it was so over the top vulgar it veered into being completely idiotic. The thing starts with ""Fade the fuck in."" I felt like it was making fun of itself 90% of the time."
Earwolf,35r9kg,turnk,6,Wed May 13 04:20:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't find it funny either and I was really doubting my own sense of humor. Then I thought it might be funny if it was done in a David Wain ""They Came Together"" kind of way that makes fun of the raunchy R-rated comedy tropes that this script supposedly ""subverts"". Or maybe that was what they were acutally going for and it just didn't translate."
Earwolf,35r9kg,branmuffinzed,6,Tue May 12 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe there needed to be visual cues to sell the jokes and the ""subversion?""   But still! Tom Cruise is not a punch line! Neither is inserting ""fuck"" into your stage (camera?) directions! Or having the lead be given everything he wants and still be dissatisfied! How is anything actually being subverted?!  I get that it's meant to grab the script-reader's attention but come on. It's just old by the fifth extraneous ""fuck.""  The more I think about it the more baffled I become."
Earwolf,35r9kg,istartriots,2,Tue May 12 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"It felt like every other R-rated comedy. It's really more of the same. Maybe when it was written, it was more original, but after the hangover, it really doesn't feel special."
Earwolf,35r9kg,nohorseman,2,Tue May 12 21:39:43 2015 UTC,I'm only on episode two but I didn't think it was nearly as bad as you are making it out to be.  At the same time I didn't laugh a lot but still found a lot of it legitimately funny.   I feel as if it was an actual movie and I saw it in theaters with other people I would be laughing a shitload.
Earwolf,35r9kg,ericfishlegs,2,Wed May 13 13:31:46 2015 UTC,I'm interested to hear your thoughts when you get to the end.
Earwolf,35r9kg,nrkist2424,5,Wed May 13 14:17:38 2015 UTC,Yes I dropped it after the second episode. I can't imagine a drama keeping my interest more.  I'd love for it to lead to jobs for the incredible cast though.
Earwolf,35r9kg,nrkist2424,1 point,Tue May 12 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine a drama keeping my interest more.   At FIRST I was intrigued at the prospects of a drama - The Truth podcast  does short, dramatic fiction and it's very engaging (which, honestly, did ""ear movies"" first and way, way better).   But the short synopsis didn't sound at all interesting. I'm willing to give it a shot, though.   And yes, if it leads to more jobs for the cast then more power, I guess."
Earwolf,35r9kg,airJordan45,1 point,Tue May 12 22:21:53 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of the show because they're basically radio plays which could be great, but I'm relieved at the mixed reviews it's getting because I love the cast and thought some it it was kind of funny (amusing enough to listen to the whole thing) but I hardly thought it was some work of undiscovered greatness. I didn't even really think it was all that vulgar. I basically felt the whole thing was kind of OK."
Earwolf,35r9kg,nohorseman,1 point,Sat May 16 21:42:37 2015 UTC,I think...the entire thing is a joke.  They play it absolutely straight in the context of a podcast resurrecting a blacklist script.  I can't explain it otherwise.  Neither the script(s) nor the weird concept (if I am correct) is funny in execution.  See Wolfpop's/Scheer's own flagship Stallone Show.  It was an entirely meta thing that he played totally straight.  I think Wolfpop might be just 'to edgy' for me to get the comedy...but I'm pretty sure they are taking a huge **** on these scripts they review and are mocking them.
Earwolf,35r9kg,GeorgeTaylorG,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:49:12 2015 UTC,"That actually DOES make the MOST sense out of any other interpretation I have seen. And I could get down with that except:  1) The writers were on the show talking unironically about how great their script was and talk on their website about how succesful it is.  2) When I wrote a negative review about episodes 1-4 Leonard Franklin and Paul Scheer were all up on me about how I didn't understand why the script was funny and about how it was actually satire.  I mean MAYBE they go to the mat for something they're making fun of but there was a lot of language like ""we believe in this script"" and ""we think this is funny.""    3) The Blacklist is an actual thing with an actual reputation and it seems unlikely they would put their name on the line for the sake of some larfs at the expense of their customers. I mean, maybe. But I sincerely doubt it.  And still! If they did it for the meta-lulz it still failed completely and utterly in that regard since you are the first of a number of people I have talked to even catch a whiff of that.   Not that you're wrong!"
Earwolf,35r9kg,homestar86,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"Well, if my theory is correct, Wolfpop is gas-lighting the writers of the 'blacklist' scripts.  Also, Balls Out, had a weird meme campaign to establish itself as a 'blacklist' script.  It snowballed a little 5 years ago, and people started looking at it, but it was entirely engineered by the writers.  It's not a real thing, or a blacklist script.  Nobody ever looked at it.  You can find the script online, and it looks like it was composed by a child.  Like, the mechanical aspects of the script are beyond illegible..."
Earwolf,35r9kg,homestar86,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:51:51 2015 UTC,"Man, I don't know.   If they're trying to mock the writers they sure go to a lot of trouble to try and defend and promote the piece as being actually funny. I also found the script and it seems perfectly legible to me.   And the writers are real - why would they go onto the podcast if they had even a whiff of being mocked? They also seemed to genuinely believe the script was funny.   I'm also almost finished with the second script and ... well ... they seem to be playing it straight. This one isn't outright bad but it isn't great, and if Wolfpop are playing it for yuks, they're failing miserably, even approaching it with the meta-snark level you're suggesting.   I mean I love the idea of Scheer and co secretly mocking terrible scripts but I don't think that's what's going on here. As far as I can tell. If that's what it is, I think they're hiding it too well."

Earwolf,35phih,Cantkillabullmoose,35,Tue May 12 13:16:58 2015 UTC,"I don't get why companies invest so much time and energy into these type of things.  Why would I want an app to get only Earwolf p-casts when I can get an app that will allow me to listen to any p-cast?  It ends up destroying the user experience.  When I want to listen to something I don't want to end up having to check my Earwolf app, Nerdist App, Maximum Fun app, NPR app, TWIT app...  I instead check Overcast and am listening to the newest p-cast in seconds."
Earwolf,35phih,Vincent__Adultman,13,Tue May 12 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"I can think of a few reasons.   Listener Analytics: Beyond download stats, they can now have more insight into when people listen, which episodes get skipped and which ads they skip. This information is pure gold for Midroll.  It's not necessarily for the experienced podcast fan: As mentioned, it's an easy way to get introduced to the Earwolfpop universe. Now podcast guests and hosts can simply say ""Download the Howl app"" to listen. It's not meant to be a competitor to Overcast, Downcast, etc.  Discoverability: I've been a loyal Downcast user for years, but there is no way to conveniently see a collection of all the shows on a particular network. If I wanted to sample some of the under-the-radar shows, I'd go the Howl app route instead of adding each one to my list of subscribed shows within Downcast.  Exclusive Content: No clue if this has been implemented, but it would make sense to start offering paid content through the app like the Live CBB episodes.   It's an experiment: These types of apps are not expensive to produce. If it's successful, I'm sure they will roll it out to Android."

If I wanted to sample some of the under-the-radar shows, I'd go the Howl app route instead of adding each one to my list of subscribed shows within Downcast.   This is probably the biggest reason. A dedicated app will give more of a spotlight to the more obscure shows. Just downloading and checking the app for the first time introduced me to 3-4 p-casts I had never even heard of. Also I have been meaning to download the new Black List podcast but I always kept forgetting. Now it's right there in my face. I subscribe to so many podcasts that my app gets unwieldy and cluttered. This is a good way to clear some of it up and pick and choose episodes I want to listen to across all of Earwolf and Wolfpop"

Earwolf,35phih,CrouchJr,1 point,Tue May 12 17:59:46 2015 UTC,Will it import from the apple app? The main reason I don't try other apps is because I have all my podcasts including a few with a large back catalog I'm working through with various smart playlists. I used to use Downcast but after updating once I accidentally deleted all my app data so I switched to Apple's app because it seemed like they improved it since last I tried it and it's all backed up in the cloud.
Earwolf,35phih,sojik,2,Tue May 12 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"I use Overcast for a number of reasons. The interface is WAY nicer, in my opinion. It has really convenient buttons that let you skip 30 seconds back/forth. It also gives you the option to speed up playback without distorting the sound. I didn't even realize I wanted that feature until I tried it out.  Actually, the initial reason I started using a 3rd party app was that I wanted to get podcasts out of iTunes. Syncing between the phone and iTunes on the PC was cumbersome and always seemed to create problems. Mostly I just want to sync my listening progress so I can pick up listening on any device. Overcast makes this easy because they have a web interface."
Earwolf,35phih,mullacc,2,Tue May 12 17:54:30 2015 UTC,"The apple app has the speed up and slow down feature, and a 15 sec forward and back button as well.  I guess I think it's a good looking app, and I never listen to podcasts on anything other than my iphone, so that's why I don't see the draw I suppose."
Earwolf,35phih,CrouchJr,1 point,Tue May 12 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"hrm. I guess it wasn't the existence of skip buttons, but the ability to change the interval. Overcast gives you a choice of 7, 15, 30, 45 or 60 seconds.  I guess I just forgot about the podcast app's playback speed setting."
Earwolf,35phih,mullacc,1 point,Tue May 12 21:56:05 2015 UTC,You might be thinking of Smart Speed.

Earwolf,35phih,apaeter,3,Tue May 12 21:26:27 2015 UTC,They commented on facebook that an android version is in the works.
Earwolf,35phih,wafflesocks,6,Tue May 12 14:54:49 2015 UTC,"They said that with the old app, too. It never got to anything useful."
Earwolf,35phih,JustinPA,5,Tue May 12 18:21:46 2015 UTC,So that's what Bob Ducca was talking about.
Earwolf,35phih,oshoney,4,Tue May 12 22:37:12 2015 UTC,Hmm I will try it just to support them but I am happy with podcast addict. I used stitcher for 3000 hours but they recently had problems getting podcasts to update as soon as they were released.
Earwolf,35phih,bloodflart,4,Tue May 12 13:21:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I like Pocket Casts but I'll use this to listen to some of the dead shows like Earwolf Challenge and stuff. I don't like having those cluttering my app up.
Earwolf,35phih,oshoney,1 point,Tue May 12 13:22:52 2015 UTC,"I use stitcher at home, but I listen to the most pcasts at work on my work computer,  which usually means listening a few hours from when episodes get posted."
Earwolf,35phih,steampunkjesus,2,Tue May 12 13:32:57 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with the top comment, it reminds me of the Facebook messenger app. It was too redundant to have two apps for one thing."
Earwolf,35phih,IBIZABAR,4,Wed May 13 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"The messenger app isn't redundant though. I have no desire to ever look at a Facebook news feed again, but I do want to easily be in contact with some of my Facebook friends.  But yeah, this app is pretty pointless."
Earwolf,35phih,iamtheliqor,5,Tue May 12 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"Great app (grap). Love the design and I listen to so many p-casts on both networks that it doesn't both me to have a separate app for it. Especially since while I listen to a lot of their p-casts, I might not listen to every episode of every one. Having an easy place to pick and choose is a good call.  I would love it if they could add easy access to the player's club for NNF on this though."
Earwolf,35phih,Prax150,4,Tue May 12 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna think positive and hope that maybe downloading the app will get me a sclussi or two. Like commentary on the commentary grep of UTU2TM, or one giant mashup remix of all the ""Daly and the Zouks"" eps.  Hell, I'd even take VIP access to Zouks' friendster profile  (He's not on twitter, guys)"

He never brings it up on HDTGM or anywhere else that I can tell.  Earwolf has CBB as their ""anchor"" podcast but Wolfpop seems to be a hodgepodge of random podcasts with nothing really tying them together."

That would be frustrating."
Earwolf,35phih,fireworksordie,3,Tue May 12 21:23:58 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's just a relaunch of the old Earwolf app that they used to have."
Earwolf,35phih,blahblahblahdkjdfgj,-2,Tue May 12 15:30:17 2015 UTC,Okay? Doesn't really negate what I said though.
Earwolf,35phih,fireworksordie,2,Tue May 12 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"To clarify: There's probably no reason to worry that they're going to make stuff app exclusive since they've had an app for years and never did that, and they're just relaunching it."
Earwolf,35phih,blahblahblahdkjdfgj,1 point,Tue May 12 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"so, is this what Bob was talking about relaunching on?"

I had always loved the CBBTV show since I discovered it and I had read that it was based on the podcast.  Then noticed it on Soundcloud one day, listened, and I was completely hooked.  Over the past six months CBB has lead me to Thrilling Adventure Hour, Superego, I4H, Andy Daly PPP, Spont, UTU2TM, NNF, Womp It Up, and as of today Hollywood Handbook.    What would I be doing without these podcasts?  Probably a lot more work."
Earwolf,35nizd,POZZD,3,Wed May 13 05:14:26 2015 UTC,I took it! Thanks for putting this together. It was a simple yet great survey. Interested in the seeing the results.

Here's an iTunes link, but it's the Irish iTunes, so not sure if it'll redirect for you: https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/who-charted-live-from-vancouver/id605500402  The price is a bit high [I've always wondered if that was a pricing error], but I'm happy to pay considering all the ""free funny"" they give us."
Earwolf,35ohbr,IWantToMakeASuperman,2,Tue May 12 07:15:20 2015 UTC,EUR9? that's punchy.  I guess if you treat it as covering for all the freebies it's a bargain  Just checked the UK iTunes store and they're £7.99 there too - three of them
Earwolf,35ohbr,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Tue May 12 08:54:27 2015 UTC,"It's weird... another podcast I listen to, The Crabfeast, put up 'premium' episodes on iTunes now. But they always warn you that when the thing first appears on iTunes, it'll be around $9... due to being interpreted by Apple as an album, or something. Then they have to go in and get in re-categorized as a single.  So yeah, they always say don't buy it when it first appears, wait until the prices reduces to €1.49.  I just wonder if that's what happened with the Who Charted eps, and they just didn't realise it/didn't try 'fix' it."
Earwolf,35ohbr,IWantToMakeASuperman,2,Tue May 12 09:27:11 2015 UTC,"Strange, I've said before but I don't know why podcasts don't set up a podcast fee for premium episodes.  NNF have a feed that you need a login for and its super easy from the customer end.  The CBB live shows for example, I need to download on my laptop, then get them onto my phone, then use an alternate music player which doesn't keep track of which one I've listened to"
Earwolf,35ohbr,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Tue May 12 10:20:50 2015 UTC,"My app let's me set up a ""virtual feed"" for a particular folder on my phone, which makes it look like it's coming in from an RSS feed (and more importantly get the skip forward and backwards, and which are in progress / listened etc.) Your app might too, under some Advanced heading somewhere"

I get that you need to publicize the Handbook a bit, but two 7 minute ads is not the way to do it. Advertising a podcast inside of another advertisment is condescending and overbearing."

My favorite moment from Byron Denniston: His angry bang of the table when Scott explains a way Kate Middleton can escape from Byron's sight (""That makes angry!""). I got the same laugh from Joey Tortellini's loud knocking during the Silicon Valley episode and from Victor Diamond's loud thud when he passes out during Would you Rather.

Earwolf,35hpne,nicemaker,18,Sun May 10 14:08:05 2015 UTC,You should also mention that Jessica St. Clair plays Andy Daly's wife on Review!
Earwolf,35hpne,angelfromthecoast,2,Sun May 10 16:23:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, updated!"
Earwolf,35hpne,potatohead3,14,Sun May 10 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"<3 I adore Womp it Up! The last episode had me really envisioning lil' Nicky and Marissa living together, Wompler and Listler's world seems very realistic. Playing House is great, the police stripping and Bosephus are my favorite bits. And for a romantic comedy, the romance between Jessica's character and Keegan Michael Key's character always keeps me interested. Maybe just because the two of them are both so funny and so beautiful (and actually have chemistry).  Jessica also plays Tony Hale's over-protective cheese making girlfriend (Dana) in Veep. And as good as she is in that role I was a thousand times more excited to see a snippet of Lennon's new character last week on Veep! She plays Selena Meyer's new advisor and is more poised than any other member of Selina's incompetent staff. I love seeing her in a glamorous, professional role & she will be a great addition to the cast.  In a Paley Festival Veep Panel (from a few years ago?) that's on yahoo, Julia Louis Dreyfus said that her favorite guest stars are Jessica and Lennon. She also said thinks they are hilarious and hopes to work more with them & now she is with Lennon's new role on Veep! I was so happy to know how much she appreciates their craft.   Ok, think I've made it clear that I love these ladies, bye."
Earwolf,35hpne,gabe1108,3,Sun May 10 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"You summed up my opinions perfectly! I first heard of them through CBB and fell in love with their voices and personalities then heard through their plugs of playing house. I was happy to hear it was new enough to catch up on the first season quick. Loved the show. I'm glad to see all their success going forward. Also I love when I compliment them on twitter and Lennon and Jessica actually respond. They seem super down to earth. They have my full support. And I'm going to look into finding some ""Womp it up!"" Merch."
Earwolf,35hpne,potatohead3,2,Sun May 10 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"TY! I'm anxious to see what they do in the future too. & I would love Womp It Up merch, if I got some it would be my first earwolf purchase :)"
Earwolf,35hpne,ProRustler,8,Mon May 11 00:48:44 2015 UTC,Lennon was great as the easy listening DJ on the CBB TV show. Forsythia! Forsythia...
Earwolf,35hpne,potatohead3,1 point,Sun May 10 16:58:48 2015 UTC,Shit I haven't seen that....this is why I should watch all of CBB tv instead of choosing episodes that seem good.
Earwolf,35hpne,Condawg,2,Sun May 10 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"That was the episode that aired this past Friday. They're all good. Some obviously aren't as good as others, but this isn't a show you should only watch ones with guests you like or whatever, they've all got great moments."
Earwolf,35hpne,potatohead3,3,Sun May 10 22:26:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just watched it with my sister after you mentioned it today. Then I made my sister listen to ""the Reason"". And I really should make it one of my weekly shows."
Earwolf,35hpne,Quinez,11,Mon May 11 00:45:00 2015 UTC,"Jessica St. Clair is such a glorious weirdo.  I like podcasts where she doesn't play a character but she might as well be playing one.  Like the HDTGM where she is completely lost over the plot of Pluto Nash, or the Improv4Humans where she invents a false memory about Jason Mantzoukas being chased through Manhattan after 9/11, or the Improv4Humans and the Who Charted where she talks about trying fruit for the first time as an adult and hating it.  ""Berries.  They have the consistency of slugs and they explode in your mouth... no thank you."""
Earwolf,35hpne,oshoney,8,Sun May 10 22:47:54 2015 UTC,They are just so good together. Wompler's solo appearances are still good but it's another level when it's with Listler. It really shows that they're real life best friends in the way they improv. If you've listened to actual interviews with them the Wompler/Listler relationship makes even more sense. Lennon is kinda that rock that keeps Jessica grounded.
Earwolf,35hpne,jacabo,5,Sun May 10 16:41:49 2015 UTC,I haven't seen Best Friends Forever but enjoy Playing House.   What's the consensus on  BFF?

Earwolf,35hpne,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Sun May 10 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"Worth a watch, it has a lot of bits that are classic Jess and Len.  For me it feels like they took a lot of the stuff they found funny and would joke about regularly and mashed it into a TV show.  I'm not saying this as a negative, but Playing House has a much better story arc and feels more like a TV show than BFF did - I think BFF was almost a prototype and they took what they learnt there and made something better"
Earwolf,35hpne,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,5,Mon May 11 02:10:08 2015 UTC,I loved them on HDTGM Pluto Nash.
Earwolf,35hpne,jpatton89,3,Sun May 10 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"The namesake of my Reddit flair! Whomp it up!  Paul F Tompkins has some great continuity with his characters. But Marissa Whompler and Miss Listler have the absolute best continuity in Comedy Bang Bang. I actually get excited to hear about what's been going on in these fictional characters lives. lol And it's made even better when they talk about other people like Gutterballs, who become cannon to the show as characters themselves!"

He had previously said ""All right, this is the one, this one sticks..."" and didn't reuse that particular catchphrase.  I figure if he says it a third time it might become a thing.

Earwolf,35g9no,CrouchJr,3,Sun May 10 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like sports too, after I finish the backlog of the podcast I'm currently listening to, I'm thinking of starting the sklars."
Earwolf,35g9no,dcfc821,13,Sun May 10 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"Best part is you can just pick right up with the most recent episode no problem. No feeling of obligation to go back and listen to older episodes, unlike some other podcasts where you need to start earlier to understand the concept.  Though if you are at all interested in pro wrestling, I'd recommend their most recent episode with Chris Jericho. A lot of funny stories there."
Earwolf,35g9no,HipGuide,5,Sun May 10 02:06:04 2015 UTC,Haha. It's sometimes a rough listen because they hate dead air. Hence the unpopularity.
Earwolf,35g9no,catch_th3m_all,5,Sun May 10 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, well you know the worst thing I can do is try it out and decide I don't like it. I've heard a few episodes though it's pretty good."
Earwolf,35g9no,dcfc821,2,Sun May 10 02:06:05 2015 UTC,I love the Sklar Bros! They're so enthusiastic about everyone they have on the podcast. Probably to enthusiastic but their enthusiasm is infectious. Both a solid guys as well!
Earwolf,35g9no,pbbatenatar,10,Wed May 13 02:36:49 2015 UTC,Does Affirmation Nation count? I can't get enough of Bob Ducca's hilarity.
Earwolf,35g9no,arcadium83,3,Sun May 10 02:07:24 2015 UTC,I guess it does kinda count huh? I didn't even think about that one because of how much I love it. I hope it's not really ending like he said in the last episode. It's one of my favorites.
Earwolf,35g9no,2128m,5,Sun May 10 02:16:26 2015 UTC,Jessica Chaffin and Jamie Denbo are so good as Ronna & Beverly that it's easy to forget these are people playing characters. Infact even if they were real people it would still be a great show because the characters have such good chemistry together.
Earwolf,35g9no,catch_th3m_all,5,Sun May 10 07:37:03 2015 UTC,"I love the Sklars. If you're into sports, this is the long awaited union of  in depth sports banter and comedy. The guests always have something interesting to say about their fandom. The format of the show is sharp and just works, for both Country and County. They also feature fantastic music."
Earwolf,35g9no,DanzigMeowMeow,5,Mon May 11 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"Sklarbro County was the first Earwolf podcast I got into after listening to the first episode with Colt Cabana as guest. I still listen though I do think the earlier episodes were the most fun. I rarely listen to Country unless there is a no brainer guest.   County is a good listen though. Dan Van Kirk is one of my favorite personalities in podcasting, the show is much less sports-focused than Country, the guests are usually pretty interesting and more obscure, and the stories they dissect are generally good for a laugh. He doesn't do as much for them anymore but the Jason Nash character voicemails are pretty great, as are the Jesse Ventura call ins (I'd argue that this character works better in these short bursts than he does as a long form CBB guest).   If you'd like to give it a shot, I'd recommend ep 34 w/Beth Lapides, 26 w/Cash Levy, and 31 w/Jon Dore (""ohh hey Jon, Brandon's gotten so big!"")"
Earwolf,35g9no,TheBlackSpank,1 point,Tue May 12 00:41:24 2015 UTC,They are crazy about Jon Dore!
Earwolf,35g9no,DanzigMeowMeow,7,Wed May 13 02:39:13 2015 UTC,"I like Nerd Poker because I'm drawn to narratives and characters. When it first came out there wasn't a whole lot of RPG podcasts, and I liked Brian Posehn's Live In Nerd Rage album and his goofy ass on Mr. Show and Sarah Silverman, so I had a full on nerdboner the day it showed up on Earwolf. It's admittedly not what it used to be, but it still has a special spot in my nerdheart even though there are literally shitloads of RPG podcasts that I'd consider better now. I'm holding out hope they bring some new people in soon to take it back to the top, because when it's good it's real good."
Earwolf,35g9no,ksaid1,5,Sun May 10 02:48:31 2015 UTC,"It's gone way downhill since the original group fell apart. I love Blaine, but Sark is a hell of a DM, and much better about getting the players back on track if they start riffing for a bit too long. And Gerry was easily the most entertaining player with the best characters. I haven't listened in a while."
Earwolf,35g9no,nohorseman,2,Sun May 10 11:17:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not great"
Earwolf,35g9no,DanzigMeowMeow,4,Sun May 10 12:54:00 2015 UTC,"Ooh, any RPG podcasts you would recommend?"
Earwolf,35g9no,DanzigMeowMeow,4,Sun May 10 14:02:32 2015 UTC,"The Adventure Zone is completely wonderful! So good.   And Nerd Poker was great until episode 76 (or something like that) when their DM left the show. There are a few moments in the campaign I'll remember forever, it was amazing."
Earwolf,35g9no,flipperflooper,3,Sun May 10 14:31:05 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, The Adventure Zone is awesome so far, and they're only about 15 eps deep so if you want one you can catch up to quickly I'd suggest it.  Recently I saw someone mention Campaign, and I'm real glad I did. This one is a Star Wars RPG game done by improvisers from Chicago, and they really have fun with bringing their characters to life. The dungeon master is exceptional too, I think she might be the main dm from the One Shot Podcasts.  Drunks & Dragons, Total Party Kill and Crit Juice are popular as well. Critical Hit is one that borders more on drama than comedy, but I think it's 4 years old at this point so they have a massive story backlog that would take a year or more to catch up on. There're a lot to choose from anymore, really. If it has professional sounding audio and players/dungeon masters that you can tell are having fun, I usually fall right into them."
Earwolf,35g9no,Quinez,1 point,Sun May 10 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"I couldn't get into it myself but I was so intrigued by the premise and concept of the podcast. I'm just not crazy about D&D but I imagine if you're into that kinda thing that podcast is amazing.   Even though I wasn't too into D&D and whatnot, I got some big laughs from the first 10 episodes I listened to, I just couldn't keep focus was the main thing. Either way, I still see a lot of potential with this one, for people who like that kind of thing."
Earwolf,35g9no,WhosCountin,1 point,Sun May 10 02:51:15 2015 UTC,"That's cool :) I enjoy a good D&D podcast in the same way I enjoy an I4H scene, except the characters that are created can entertain for years, until their (usually gruesome) death, and the better dungeon masters know how to keep the story moving and interesting."
Earwolf,35g9no,klobbermang,6,Sun May 10 03:00:25 2015 UTC,Hollywood Handbook is a ton of fun. The silliness of Hayes and Sean had me addicted after my first listen. Either episode with PFT would make a great starting point.
Earwolf,35g9no,Lukepatrick88,11,Sun May 10 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know if we can really count Hollywood Handbook as unpopular (at least on this sub) It's my favorite podcast, I'm really glad it's getting the recognition it deserves."
Earwolf,35g9no,Lukepatrick88,3,Sun May 10 03:06:54 2015 UTC,"Scott always says Hollywood Handbook is the least popular podcast, but I'm not sure it's true.  It would not surprise me if ""HH has the fewest listeners"" were an everlasting bit, even if it became one of the network's most popular shows."
Earwolf,35g9no,Lukepatrick88,2,Sun May 10 22:42:35 2015 UTC,"Anchorman is in a bit of a jam. Hollywood Handbook is clearly a threat to every other podcast out there - I know I used to think CBB, i4h, WSGLL, were all quality programming until I stumbled upon Hollywood Handbook and listened avidly. I'm sure as an artist, Scott would love to cancel HH so he could stay relevant, but he's also trying to rake in that sweet sweet cheddar, and Sean and Hayes must bring in the vast majority of Earwolf's revenue. So what he to do? Simple: leave the cash cow that is Hollywood Handbook on the air, but publicly state that it's a ratings failure. He can pretend he's still the big ole king of the podcasts, but he can also be business and moneysmart while playing his little game"
Earwolf,35g9no,IggysGlove,2,Tue May 12 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"The Rafflecast sketches were really funny, especially the one where it's the writers room for that cartoon. The making the song ones were sorta hit or miss, but they were still good, and not too long. The Howard Kremer one is great.  Don't think there's been a new ep in like 2 years tho."
Earwolf,35e8jl,Slayner,7,Sat May 9 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"I just found out yesterday that I'm going to Late Show with David Letterman on Tuesday!  It's a week and a day before his final show. I know he hasn't been great in a long time but I grew up watching his show so I'll always have a soft spot for him. I'm taking my mom as a belated Mother's Day present. The guests are Bill Clinton and Adam Sandler. Yesss.   Also, Europe was incredible. I'm so sad I'm back in the states and back at work right now haha."

Loved when Kulap said something to the effect of ""this is probably the most articulate the Chartists have ever heard you"" which is true. She's aware he's a bumbling goof on the show.  Which made me feel like a Chartist more than ever. I was upvoting all the positive Armen posts in the Whooch thread this week like a mad man cause I always liked him, since Kulap and Harris couldn't be wrong about someone. And the Whiplash i4H is such a dang classic and Armen was amazing on it.   Also still digging the Stereogum chart every week, hope they keep that going."

Earwolf,35a02g,goofy_ball,5,Sun May 10 02:01:05 2015 UTC,"I've been pretty anti-Armen in the past, but this IS actually the most coherent I've ever heard him. I know the tone was really downbeat in comparison, but it made me appreciate his sense of humor more than I ever have before in the places where it peeked through. That's something I've often missed in his previous appearances, as he often steps on his own comedy with awkward bits of self-awareness and the eternal parading of his insecurities.   Wouldn't have expected myself to say this after last year's guest stint, but I hope to hear him on more podcasts (though maybe not necessarily as the Whooch guest host) in the near future.  Also, for real, it probably would've been best if they'd recorded this before Whooch. He was even more off his game than usual there.  Edit: Also, this was really cathartic for me, too. I know I didn't know Harris, but I'm still smarting from the loss, so this helped. Hope it gave Kulap and Armen some good catharsis, too."

Earwolf,35a02g,comedyprepster,6,Sun May 10 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"Armen talks about being worried about what we the listeners think, but honestly I just want to hug Armen. This community has gone through a huge loss, but what most of us felt is nothing compared to Armen's grief. It was brave of him to open up to us on Two Charted today. I feel like Kulap is right about never getting over this loss, but I hope this episode brought just a little bit of closer. It hurts to hear such a lovely people go through this pain.    Armen, we have your back 100%. We love and support you so so much."

Would also love to see Sarah Silverman and Laura Silverman on more podcasts.  Craig Ferguson on any Earwolf shows (not KPCS). That might actually be my number one.

I browse in night mode constantly to save my eyes being blinded by white backgrounds everywhere, and it conveniently turns off the subreddit style automatically if it doesn't play nice with night mode. You're gonna love it."

If you're having lots of issues with eye strain or headaches while on your computer be sure to check out a program called F.lux, too. It can automatically adjust the intensity of your screen at night so your circadian rhythm isn't as disturbed by late night browsing, as well as manually dim your screen with a simple shortcut - which is handy for desktop users who don't have a simple brightness control at their fingertips (like most laptops)."

In their defense though it's not really a simple fix for the mods unless they know their way around how the CSS works, so it's far easier if a subscriber gives them a template or design to use."

However, I never really needed it but figured the app worked so much better than the Apple Podcast App that I felt I was willing to pay 5 bucks for the service to help out the developer. If you choose not to buy anything, it works just great on its own. (Speeding up podcasts or boosting the volume is something I rarely, if ever, do.)  This thread might be of more use."

Earwolf,3549b0,nohorseman,2,Thu May 7 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"Pocketcast is the best with beyond pod coming in second. Pocketcast has a great ui with the ability to stream podcasts. The ability to boost volume, skip silence, and increase variable playback on local media. Most free podcast apps are really not worth the hassle due to it missing key features, bad ui, or some restriction too pay for a pro version. Good podcatchers are worth ever penny if you use them often."

Earwolf,351d35,goofy_ball,3,Wed May 6 17:06:07 2015 UTC,June should be a guest host and Armen can be a guest. Because Armen can't deal with letting anything not come back to being all about him.

Earwolf,351d35,krankortega,2,Wed May 6 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"I usually find Armen amusing, but after this episode I kind-of dislike him now. Why? When he's on Earwolf with other guys he's nervous & submissive, but in this ep he's with two women and was markedly more confident. Along with June and Kulap gushing over what a lady's man he is, now I'm starting to think his nervousness is an act to disarm women.  Meanwhile, he also comes across as an out-of-touch elitist. He whines about getting work, having to talk to co-stars, etc. He grew up super-rich & well-connected, and as a result may have gotten used to everything going his way, no matter how he acts.  I don't know. I just picked up on something about him in this ep that has changed my view of him."
Earwolf,351d35,jononyx,17,Wed May 6 11:22:45 2015 UTC,"he seemed just as nervous and weird as ever, dont know what you are talking about"
Earwolf,351d35,krankortega,0,Wed May 6 12:14:46 2015 UTC,"shrugs Just my observation. If you listen to him talking around other men he's a sputtering, apologetic nebbish - which (IMO) makes n m tolerable, even amusing. Around June & Kulap he's more laid-back - even subtly arrogant. A guy that switches his personality based on the gender around him us suggestive of a manipulative personality.  Again, just my own inference. Something about him on this episode  chafed me and changed my opinion on him."
Earwolf,351d35,Teenageboy69,8,Wed May 6 12:49:10 2015 UTC,"I think he's more comfortable this time because he's friends with Kulap and June. He was more in his element. Also I think he doesn't like talking to people after takes not because he's entitled, but because he's shy and introverted."

Earwolf,351d35,JasmineForsythe,6,Wed May 6 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"Is that persona not an act? This was my first Armen episode (I've skipped them when going from the beginning, I felt like it would be a different show without Howard), and it was definitely a different experience. How did he come to be the regular co-host?"
Earwolf,351d35,Emleaux,4,Wed May 6 11:56:04 2015 UTC,"Because he is a part of the same circle as Scott and Kulap, and they seem to like him for whatever reason. He also seems to be readily available whenever they need someone to fill in for Howard."
Earwolf,351d35,Teenageboy69,10,Wed May 6 16:00:16 2015 UTC,"I think Kulap feels that the show needs a kind of ""out there"" host for the show since a lot of her hosting ability/charm comes from asking her co-host to explore their insanity."
Earwolf,351d35,summahdaze,6,Wed May 6 16:07:27 2015 UTC,I think he's just more comfortable around June and Kulap because they're friends. He seemed even more confident in the episode he co-hosted with Paul Rust as the guest.
Earwolf,351d35,willwakef,10,Wed May 6 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"He kept saying he was in a bad place or that he was going through a hard time.  That's because he was very good friends and creative partners with Harris.  He's obviously very sad, perhaps depressed, and I don't think he was ""confident"" at all in this episode, he was more vulnerable than perhaps we've ever heard him.  I think it's unfair to say that it's an ""act"" because it clearly isn't to anyone who knows much about mental illness. He obviously has almost constant anxiety and now it seems, because he was talking about being alone, that he has depression now as well. I hope it's temporary and he can find a way to move past his massive loss."
Earwolf,351d35,temporarychair,2,Wed May 6 16:23:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He's just comes off as one of those people who bashes himself in order to (sub-consciously?) receive compliments refuting his self-loathing, and even then he still won't accept the praise. It's not cute or endearing, it's irritating. You can only tell someone they're great and have them deny it so many times before you start to think, ""maybe you're right, maybe you are just a boring, neurotic mess."" Just my thoughts."
Earwolf,351d35,krankortega,-2,Fri May 8 03:07:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I may have phrased things like kind of a dick earlier, but honestly how is he enjoyable in this format?   Also: made some statements about u his wealth and background:  Fuck him.  Honestly: do you know how hard it is to get anywhere near the Earwolf realm in entertainment?  People from nothing and nowhere, their hearts and lives pumped and thrown away by the millions...  then here's Armen, son of rich, famous, crazy connected to a wildly-controversial figure and event , bumbling and stumbling and coming off poorly while indulged for whatever friendship reasons...  I know, it's free entertainment. Alban actively and openly stating my opinion that discourages Armen.  Maybe Fuck him because he doesn't deserve a shot. You have enough. Be a patron, not a participant.  Classist? Maybe. Colin Hanks, Kate Hudson, Rashida Jones, Dakota Johnson, Ben Stiller, Duncan Jones, whoever: they demonstrated an aptitude and ability independent of connection.  I argue Armen demonstrates such little talent that its an insult to artists in that field who could never imagine the riches and comfort of the guy taking yet one more rare spot away from a voice that deserves to be heard.  tl;dr: His position economically and being historically connected via birthright to awful events outweighs his ability and entry-right to outlets that are normally reflective of talent. Unlike other celebrity-born children, Armen has not demonstrated aptitude at the is form and sucks further as he takes away a spot for an unknown talent to find an audience.  In my opinion, of course."
Earwolf,351d35,temporarychair,0,Fri May 8 04:51:57 2015 UTC,"I've clearly tapped a nerve, but you're right. I never paid much attention to the guy but when I saw he was the guest co-host this week I just thought, ""oh boy, here we go...""   Because I remember past episodes where he was literally an energy vacuum, always somehow turing the conversation back to himself and how bad he was at the job he was there to do. And he didn't fail to be awkward in a way that just had me rolling my eyes the whole time.  He doesn't seem like a bad person, but I agree whole heartedly that he should look where he is and shut the fuck up about his boring insecurities. More talented people would kill to be in his position but rather than appreciate any of it he seems to be more inclined to fling this ""I'm so awkward"" shtick in our faces."
Earwolf,351d35,kovalev27,-1,Fri May 8 05:10:32 2015 UTC,I've learned to skip these episodes.  Too aggravating.  I listen to and love Who Charted because of Howard.  Just shut it down when he's not there.
Earwolf,351d35,VanceFerguson,8,Wed May 6 14:46:32 2015 UTC,"I like Armen, but I'm totally okay with getting a different host other than Armen for future substitutions. Get Steve Agee in there! He was in the pilot. Just pull him away from his nerd games with Posehn and friends and have him hate on the charts."
Earwolf,351d35,Emleaux,3,Wed May 6 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"I gave it the first 7 minutes and just had to switch to something else. He comes ""guns blazing"" right from the get-go, if you will - overly awkward, kind of cryptic, fawning over the guest a bit too much.   It is what it is - I understand that the show must go on, and I know it's lame to be critical of a free podcast. But here I am, being critical - I just really enjoy Howard."
Earwolf,351d35,Emleaux,-7,Wed May 6 19:44:31 2015 UTC,"""Yes! Armen's back - I can't wait to listen to this episode!""  -No one, ever.  I'll still give this one a listen, but that dude has used up a lot of goodwill already. I wish Besser was the guest - he knows how to properly handle Capt. Carf."
Earwolf,351d35,lovers_acid,17,Wed May 6 14:13:49 2015 UTC,I actually had that exact reaction when I saw he was on
Earwolf,351d35,PDCchewie88,8,Wed May 6 17:03:50 2015 UTC,It's almost as if people are allowed to have different opinions!
Earwolf,351d35,tkdgns,5,Wed May 6 18:36:27 2015 UTC,I disagree.     wait
Earwolf,351d35,PDCchewie88,5,Thu May 7 02:45:00 2015 UTC,I actually really look forward to him on the show.
Earwolf,351d35,tkdgns,2,Wed May 6 18:35:40 2015 UTC,Me too.
Earwolf,351d35,tkdgns,3,Thu May 7 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree but I respect your right to that opinion. In fact, I find it fascinating that so many people here have such a visceral reaction to him!"
Earwolf,351d35,rangpire,-4,Thu May 7 02:43:30 2015 UTC,Maybe Armen would be happier if he admitted he was gay.
Earwolf,351d35,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,-12,Wed May 13 05:18:55 2015 UTC,Glad she can do this terrible podcast but can't show up to her own for... two months?
Earwolf,351vdw,Slayner,8,Wed May 6 12:28:23 2015 UTC,Maybe keep it to one thread where the discussion is in the comments? I worry about the sudden influx of threads becoming annoying and turning people off of the show.
Earwolf,351vdw,JasmineForsythe,3,Wed May 6 14:23:49 2015 UTC,"I'd do that if we could sticky the post, but it would get buried and there would be next to no discussion.

Earwolf,34y4hc,coitusFelcher,48,Tue May 5 23:39:43 2015 UTC,How does he balance work and family?
Earwolf,34y4hc,NorthDrive,6,Tue May 5 23:55:58 2015 UTC,"No kidding. I've heard some more serious interviews with Scott though, and while he does stay super busy, he still finds time to enjoy himself. And really it's his passion to do all these projects. He LOVES comedy just like the rest of us, so more power to him you know?"
Earwolf,34y4hc,weaglebeagle,6,Tue May 5 23:42:59 2015 UTC,Plus this next season won't be as long as season four. That will probably help a lot.
Earwolf,34y4hc,GiantDeviantPiano,36,Wed May 6 00:44:35 2015 UTC,So well deserved. I swear the show only gets better with each season. There are so many things to love about the show and the insane amount of people making guest appearances or who they book for the main show.   Glad that it's getting the attention it and Scott deserve.
Earwolf,34y4hc,turdninja,7,Tue May 5 15:22:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its great news. There's been some great chat about this on the /r/Earwolf Slack chat   Wait, did you even know there's a Slack chat that people can join (for free) if they PM /u/Slayner their email address?   Huh, you're /u/Slayner... I guess this message is useless unless it helps someone else reading join the chat"
Earwolf,34y4hc,splice_of_life,3,Wed May 6 03:19:45 2015 UTC,"I thought the last few eps have been some of the best out of all the seasons, I think Scott has really hit his stride with the TV show."
Earwolf,34y4hc,thecricketnerd,2,Wed May 6 11:09:14 2015 UTC,"Watching the show on a week to week basis, I have the same impression as you - the show gets better with every season.  This weekend, I went back and rewatched S1, though - still pretty damn strong.  As a side note, I am SO excited in advance for the season 4 DVD commentary.  With so many episodes to bang through it's going to go wonderfully off the rails in the best way."
Earwolf,34y4hc,RadioRaheem_,10,Wed May 6 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"I'm very happy for Hot Saucerman. IFC seem to have a lot of confidence in the show, going by their statement."

""I'm here to discuss why this show sucks but no one will argue with me, so I'm gonna criticize the community that I'm a part of!"" Really though, you're not mad about the lack of intelligent discussion, you're mad because the made-up point system says you're in the negative.  So you attack the Reddit community and act superior, even though the only reason you care is because of an imaginary point system and because people don't seem to generally agree with you.  Obviously the majority of people here don't think the show sucks, because the post we are all replying to is about the show being renewed.  Why would you come here bitching about it if you don't like it?  Do you want us to change your mind?  What kind of discussion are you looking for?  I like it...you dont, end of discussion.  Call it a circlejerk if you'd like, but I'd rather commiserate with other like-minded people about a show I enjoy rather than get into a pointless argument that in the end only lets you tell people why they are wrong for enjoying a television show, and at best will end with both parties agreeing to disagree.

Earwolf,34y4hc,KingDongBundy,2,Thu May 7 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"I watched the first season when it first went up on Netflix and I just remember being so confused.  So confused that I started Googling the show to try and figure out what I was missing.  That, of course, led me to the podcast and all the wonders that lay within.  I'm still not big on the first season, the second is better, but IMO, 3 and 4 have been awesome.  It feels like they figured out how to get the absurdity of the CBB world to fit television better.  The interview sections also feel looser and sillier, and I really love that."
Earwolf,351dpv,lakeradio,9,Wed May 6 08:18:28 2015 UTC,I really like the reality show show theme
Earwolf,351dpv,Slayner,15,Wed May 6 12:40:55 2015 UTC,How Did This Get Made's new one is really really good. HH is a classic theme too.

I'm not that big on NNF's theme, but at this point I feel like bad music taste is apart of the charm of the show. And I'm not sure if I'm just bored of it at thsi point, but I usually skip CBB's theme these days. It just goes on a little too long for my liking."

Earwolf,34sxod,sevillianrites,73,Mon May 4 08:08:01 2015 UTC,Cake Boss!  Ho Ho!  Tic Toc!  Drums!  I'll never get tired of how little Mike Hanford knows about the Beatles. He's been caught off guard each time he's appeared. It really makes that character so much better.
Earwolf,34sxod,NotAGoodPoster,16,Mon May 4 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"It's like Horatio not knowing about Kanye, and Daly not knowing about the Peppers."
Earwolf,34sxod,klobbermang,51,Tue May 5 15:16:22 2015 UTC,Time Keeper is one of the best Neil Campbell creations since all of his other creations.
Earwolf,34sxod,goofy_ball,10,Mon May 4 21:20:34 2015 UTC,"I really hope Time Keeper somehow comes back in a Time Bobby episode, having Neil Campbell, Bobby Moynihan, and PFT would be amazing."
Earwolf,34sxod,atsao,15,Thu May 7 06:44:39 2015 UTC,Favorite Neil Campbell character?  Mine's the extremely self-aware teenager from #193. One of my all-time favorite characters by anybody.
Earwolf,34sxod,tkdgns,8,Tue May 5 21:11:20 2015 UTC,"When it turned in on itself and it was clear that he was talking about teenagers mocking Neil Campbell, that was unbelievably great."
Earwolf,34sxod,IdealizedSalt,3,Fri May 8 16:24:06 2015 UTC,That's hands down my favorite Campbell character. And also one of my absolute favorite CBB characters period.

Earwolf,34sxod,reb_mccuster,3,Tue May 5 15:02:16 2015 UTC,There is something so endearing about him and his dorky wit that it makes terrible characters oddly engaging and funny.

Earwolf,34sxod,steampunkjesus,13,Mon May 4 11:10:19 2015 UTC,My favorite episodes are when he really gets into his character and the rest of the show just flows. I'm still listening to this one but it's been amazing so far.
Earwolf,34sxod,majorspoils,6,Mon May 4 18:47:58 2015 UTC,Specifically the podcast Scott character.
Earwolf,34sxod,tkdgns,63,Tue May 5 21:07:16 2015 UTC,Ahhh what a lineup. I really hope this signifies Middleditch becoming something of a regular. The man is an absolute monster.

Earwolf,34sxod,srbuscher,32,Mon May 4 19:04:39 2015 UTC,I can't wait until the whole show is just the different themes songs and all the additions of people commenting on the quality of the song.
Earwolf,34sxod,fezfrascati,4,Mon May 4 18:36:35 2015 UTC,That was a good comment.
Earwolf,34sxod,fezfrascati,3,Thu May 14 06:29:26 2015 UTC,That was a good comment.

Earwolf,34sxod,goofy_ball,30,Thu May 14 11:38:46 2015 UTC,Scott sounded really happy during this. It made my soul feel good.
Earwolf,34sxod,toomanylizards,27,Mon May 4 22:40:18 2015 UTC,I always forget how funny Neil Campbell is.
Earwolf,34sxod,jayraay,13,Mon May 4 17:05:18 2015 UTC,Rick Faber will always be my favorite character on CBB.
Earwolf,34sxod,deanstockwell,4,Mon May 4 17:17:52 2015 UTC,When he was the snow boarder who wrote a song about righteous trails or whatever was great!
Earwolf,34sxod,shrapnade,37,Mon May 4 18:04:58 2015 UTC,That was Mike Hanford.
Earwolf,34sxod,spacemanoncrack,2,Mon May 4 18:19:17 2015 UTC,i really thought mike did both characters since the snowboarder does sound similar to the time keeper.

Earwolf,34sxod,TvsPhil,25,Mon May 4 13:36:06 2015 UTC,"Now that I've completed it, the highlights for me were the Time Keeper(I love Neil Campbell characters), the new reveal of Brad Hammerstone and which character he was, Riddle Me This bits, Scott flying using his Mantzoukas spell, and John Lennon's ""As My Guitar Gently Sleeps""  We need more Time Keeper in future episodes!"
Earwolf,34sxod,tkdgns,12,Mon May 4 11:32:01 2015 UTC,Favorite Neil Campbell character?  Mine's the extremely self-aware teenager from #193. One of my all-time favorite characters by anybody.
Earwolf,34sxod,TvsPhil,8,Tue May 5 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Rick Faber is a great concept. A teen who knows his terrible.  His news producer from the recent Christmas episode was great even if just for the line ""Stories about Mordor go fifth in the ord-or"" I also like when he played himself on a Halloween episode and read a monologue as a psychopath. ""My favorite word is...BUGS!"""
Earwolf,34sxod,tkdgns,3,Tue May 5 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, having a bunch of rules about what order different stories come in wasn't even part of the producer character as originally conceived, it just happened in the improv. What a pro.  Edit: of"

Earwolf,34sxod,Gagege,11,Mon May 4 22:35:11 2015 UTC,That had never happened before! Engineer Cody Boy is always screwing up but no one ever called him on it!
Earwolf,34sxod,VanceFerguson,12,Tue May 5 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"Scott called him out once for being late to the recording because he was watching American Horror Story: Coven.   ""More like bitchcraft!"" was the sick burn Scott used for Coven. (Also, it's the name of the first episode of the season)  Also, Howard used to bust Cody's balls all the time on Two Charted, but I think eventually he thought it was too much, so he pulled back. However, I think he should have doubled down. It got awkward at times, but it was funny."
Earwolf,34sxod,Gagege,3,Tue May 5 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"I was making a funny. But thanks for the little run down. Also, you forgot the constant Cody berating that happens on Hollywood Handbook."
Earwolf,34sxod,thejjar,7,Tue May 5 17:07:44 2015 UTC,I've grown to love Cody because of HH.  He's surprisingly funny
Earwolf,34sxod,tkdgns,7,Tue May 5 20:28:57 2015 UTC,Plus he got S&H to join the Pen 15 club.

Earwolf,34sxod,blahblahblahdkjdfgj,22,Tue May 5 15:00:44 2015 UTC,"The Time Keeper character was just too good. I love how quickly it was unraveled and revealed to just be a normal guy, and it got better and better throughout the episode."

Earwolf,34sxod,Slayner,35,Mon May 4 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I love the anniversary episodes, and I completely forgot it was this week. This was a pleasant surprise.   I know a lot of people are burnt out on Cake Boss, but I was happy to have him back, he bounces off Scott so well. Ho-ho is amazing, so happy we don't have to wait a year to hear this character, and Klaus is just fantastic so far.   I'll edit this when I get further in, but so far this episode is fantastic.   Edit: the Timekeeper! Campbells voice is so great. ""How old are you?"" I'm 31....   Edit 2: TON of great characters, EVERYONE was so on point. This episode is best of material to me. No crazy backstories, just some past guests fucking around for like 2 hours. Perfect."
Earwolf,34sxod,GiantDeviantPiano,12,Mon May 4 12:31:22 2015 UTC,Cake boss seemed way less Cake Bossy on this one

Earwolf,34sxod,RadioRaheem_,7,Tue May 5 04:21:27 2015 UTC,"Apparently those all came from one session. If I'm remembering correctly, Sean and Hayes happened to be at the studio when Scott came in to record a bunch of ads, and he asked if they wanted to join him. They were really nervous. Sean talked about it when he was on Trends with Benefits."

Earwolf,34sxod,MrJebbers,22,Mon May 4 19:19:36 2015 UTC,Middleditch's German character should be on the next August Lindt episode when the ADPPP comes back.
Earwolf,34sxod,chicknsandwich,11,Mon May 4 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought!  I hope Andy can find enough new Germans to have an entirely different lineup of terrible German accents.

Earwolf,34sxod,utnapishtim,-1,Mon May 4 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"I always feel like he's trying to draw attention to himself the whole time. He'll interrupt good bits and just yell out something ""random"" that he thinks is funny?  Speaking on that, I think he relies way too much on juvenile ""random"" humour that I think I would have enjoyed in middle school.  Also, the voices he chooses to use are unoriginal and grating to the ears."

I feel like there have been several weak episodes this year and they seemed to happen in pairs, which is extra disheartening. E.g. 333 (Jack Antonoff) & 334 (David Cross) and 346 (Tom Green) & 347 (Kevin Pollack).  That said, still love the show and listen to every ep. I feel like the podcast does suffer because of the TV show.  They can't all be C+'s."
Earwolf,34whg1,georgeoscarbluth,3,Tue May 5 03:51:24 2015 UTC,"Occasional weak episodes are par for the course. There's never been a year where absolutely every single CBB ep was excellent. I think because the highs are so extreme, the weaker ones stand out more. That is the essence of improv, though; not everything works and it can be trying to endure, but when it's successful, it's exceptionally good."
Earwolf,34whg1,JasmineForsythe,3,Tue May 5 13:23:07 2015 UTC,Idk I liked the Jack Antonoff and Kevin Pollack ones. But I mean every year has just a couple/bad ones. But the good ones this year have been unbelievable IMO.
Earwolf,34whg1,Mushroomer,1 point,Tue May 5 11:02:29 2015 UTC,While I disagree about the Jack Antonoff episode (one of their best musician guests) - I have to agree about the other three.

Also watched Birdemic with the Rifftrax, one of the funniest experiences of my life.  Also watched Fast 5 after listening to the HDTGM.  Although I probably would have watched it anyway.  Incredible movie.  Other than that, no, although I had seen a few of the movies before listening to their respective episodes.

There are tons of other movies that I had already seen 10-20 years ago but rewatched because they did an episode on them and honestly I enjoyed most of them. I must be easy to please.

PFT may be an experienced podcaster, but this is a new show and new shows inevitably take time to figure out what they are. Compared to the earliest episodes of CDR, Aneanation is fantastic."
Earwolf,34stx0,tkdgns,3,Mon May 4 16:54:27 2015 UTC,Didn't he say in the first ep that it would take a couple to really figure it out? Saying that I've loved everyone one so far.

Earwolf,34qae3,nicemaker,19,Sun May 3 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"It's flown under the radar around this sub, but The Hooray Show is definitely my favorite of the new shows Earwolf has been putting out. Between the phone calls, and the random musical cues, and the improv scenes, it's quite a unique experience every episode. And I know this is a respect thread for Roj, but I can't write a word about the Hooray Show without praising Chad. Chad is hilarious, but at the same time a fantastic producer. This is one of the only shows that truly has no format, and it's great for that reason. I was lucky enough to be able to get through when I called them, and it made my whole week.   TL;DR: Hooray!"
Earwolf,34qae3,nyan_swanson,32,Sun May 3 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"I saw that Coco Marx gets a little bit of hate on this sub, but he's one of my favorite characters. The end."

Earwolf,34qae3,traunks,5,Mon May 4 02:09:45 2015 UTC,"I always liked him on SNL, but had no idea he was as talented as he is until I heard him on earwolf podcasts. What I love about him is the unpredictability. He'll be doing an improv scene that's going well and is already funny, and then he'll just blindside you with something absolutely ridiculous and make it work in the scene. That to me is what separates a good improviser from a great one, the willingness to just throw a curve ball into the mix even when things are already going great. I consider him a comedy rock star.  Plus he retweeted me once which felt good."
Earwolf,34qae3,justabassplayinfool,3,Mon May 4 01:22:11 2015 UTC,"In Live From New York Horatio talks about (or is talked about) being forced into the ""Chris Farley role"" of fat guy who does physical humor even though he's more cerebral than that. I agree with you though he's hysterical when he can play weirder bits and characters when he's in his own scenes."

Earwolf,34qrsx,WhosCountin,1 point,Fri May 8 17:28:49 2015 UTC,There was a caller on Fitzdog Radio that said the same thing about the weed jokes the other day.
Earwolf,34q5h5,jwalterleavesnotes,4,Sun May 3 15:57:38 2015 UTC,I think the podcast has just evolved as has his hosting ability. CDR switched to CBB before the television show so I don't think that is the reason
Earwolf,34q5h5,lovers_acid,5,Sun May 3 16:33:28 2015 UTC,I think its one in the same because he has gotten better and more comfortable improvising with his guests which lead to the change in style. Also I remember reading an interview where he said that the program director for his former radio station told him to switch it up to make the show more entertaining rather then comedians just talking about their projects.   Just watch the show illegally online if you have no other options. I know a site if interested
Earwolf,34q5h5,lovers_acid,1 point,Sun May 3 19:57:38 2015 UTC,Just watch the show illegally online if you have no other options.   Scott has gone on the record saying he and IFC are OK with people doing this.
Earwolf,34q5h5,tkdgns,3,Sun May 3 20:12:12 2015 UTC,"It's kind of amazing to go back to early episodes and realize just how much more confident and energetic Scott sounds as a host now. He was always great at it, but he seemed to become much more comfortable with it and his particular approach to it at a certain point."
Earwolf,34q5h5,goofy_ball,0,Sun May 3 20:25:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Scott changed the name as he was getting ready to end the live show and wanted to differentiate the podcast.

Earwolf,34pntu,jwalterleavesnotes,18,Sun May 3 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"I think the change coincides when CBB (or as it was then known, CDR) stopped being a radio show. Clearing music for radio is easier than clearing music for podcasts. You'll note that many of the old episodes have the songs mostly edited out. I suspect that after it became exclusively a podcast it wasn't worth playing anything."

Earwolf,34m1gp,Slayner,4,Sat May 2 10:47:49 2015 UTC,"I know not many people care about the NFL draft but I'm gonna rant for a split second.   So I think the dolphins knocked it out of the damn Park with devante Parker, we filled that final need and got a red zone threat. He was easily the best player available so it was a solid choice.   Then round two happens, and where we're paying a guy over 100 Mill to stop the run and be dominate on that d line, we go and draft..... Another DT.   I get we needed depth in the future especially with having to pay vernon and Mitchell next year, and wake getting older. But fucking seriously? Second round pick and you're not gonna go grab a corner or for heavens sake... A GUARD? We finally got a franchise QB, and we're gonna get the motherfucker killed next year.   All I can say is I hope they have a plan with the late draft picks, it's not the end of the world but that move was not exactly my favorite. But hey, that's why they get paid the big bucks and I just sit at home and yell at the TV."

Earwolf,34m1gp,oshoney,2,Sat May 2 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"So my team got Marcus Mariota and I still don't know how to feel. I was kinda hoping we would trade back for a boatload of picks. But now he's the future of the franchise. The more I see the more I like... Now with him and Green-Beckham at least we'll have an exciting offense if nothing else.   In other news, Germany was awesome, Belgium is amazing and I'm about to head to Spain! Wooooo."
Earwolf,34m1gp,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Sat May 2 11:05:30 2015 UTC,"I hope mariota lights it up, just to prove that the transition to a spread offense and a pro style is overrated.   It's unlikely he'll be amazing from the get go, but I'm rooting for him. A bit of a head scratcher though right? I mean you guys needed far more than a QB to be contenders right?   I do think if his off field issues can be resolves DGB is gonna be a top 5 draft pick overall though."
Earwolf,34m1gp,oshoney,2,Sat May 2 11:12:09 2015 UTC,I know how to feel about it: relieved. As an Eagles fan I was somewhat concerned Chip Kelly was going to trade every pick we have for the next decade and a few starters just to land him somehow. Now I get to enjoy a full season of Sam Bradfooooohhhhh shit :(
Earwolf,34m1gp,oshoney,2,Sat May 2 13:18:16 2015 UTC,Well if he can stay healthy he's a definitive upgrade from Mr butt fumble.   If he doesn't stay healthy you'll have great draft position for next year!

Earwolf,34jvb5,RedFrogMario,3,Fri May 1 21:15:54 2015 UTC,I went to a Conan taping a few months ago and he just happened to not be there that day. I was sad. The two other times I'd been he's been the warm up and he's always wonderful.
Earwolf,34jvb5,oshoney,-6,Fri May 1 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Pardo mad me a sad person last summer.  Two years ago, I flew to LA to see a live taping of Conan. Jimmy gave the first person in line a prop from the set of the show. Well, last summer I went back to LA and while I was there I saw Conan again. Hoping to get a prop, I waited in line super early as to make sure I was the first person in line. I got to the line way earlier than I needed to. I ended up being the only person in the line for about 5 hours, until another person showed up. My cell phone died because I literally went straight from the airport to the Warner Bros studio. And I used the phone a lot on the plane. So that 5 hours was SOOO long. I was there by myself...jet-lagged after a 10 hour flight from my home in Alaska. Also, I was only in LA for 3 days, and I spent pretty much the entire first day, devoted to making sure I got a memento from Conan. I get into the studio...nothing. I got nothing. At the end of the show, I saw that they were throwing away the cue cards and the note cards that Conan kept on his desk. I asked security if I could have them since it was just getting tossed in the trash anyway. He wouldn't give it to me. I still get sad just thinking about that day. I thought Jimmy did it for the first person in line for every studio audience. I guess not..."
Earwolf,34jvb5,jpatton89,14,Sat May 2 03:44:43 2015 UTC,I don't see how any of that's Jimmy's fault.
Earwolf,34jvb5,HanSwanson,-2,Sat May 2 13:08:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I don't take it personally against Jimmy. I'm still a fan of his. I think he's great. Doesn't mean I can't be sad about the experience, though."
Earwolf,34jvb5,jpatton89,3,Sat May 2 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"why would you start it with ""Jimmy Pardo made me a sad person last summer."" then?"
Earwolf,34jvb5,dihsho,-1,Sat May 2 20:00:19 2015 UTC,"Because he's the one that didn't give me a prop from the show. I'm saying that I don't take it personally. He didn't purposely decide to NOT give me something. But his actions caused me to become disappointed. Again, I don't think he was trying to do that."
Earwolf,34jvb5,jpatton89,2,Sat May 2 20:03:13 2015 UTC,It seems like you made yourself sad with unrealistic expectations and poor planning. Pardo happened to be the warmup act in the story.

Earwolf,34jb5o,clown-from-neck-down,-2,Sat May 2 03:00:47 2015 UTC,"This ep was a little weak. Audience questions were lame, June's contribution was really frustrating to hear, and there was way too much repetition of points like the murder of a kid. I'd be more critical, but Paul Scheer is his usual energetic self (which almost saves the whole ep) and it's always fun to hear Jason make sure he mentions jerking off and (sometimes) shitting.         The episodes on After Earth and Sleepaway Camp are FIVE STARS (out of five). This ep is two stars. Hopefully, the next one will be back up to their usual standard."
Earwolf,34jb5o,DrZoidberg42,3,Fri May 1 22:57:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because I love the movie, but if I go by how much I laughed then this was a great episode.

Earwolf,34jpry,goofy_ball,3,Sat May 2 17:13:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it started to come out when he took his Jaws obsession up a notch. The whole ocean vs space thing seems to basically be him putting the whole Summah/Jaws beachtime ocean fun vibe out there above all else. It's getting kind of meh, but I appreciate that he's found some sort of theme to endorse and run with. I will say that comparing the existence of Griffith Observatory to the Nazis winning WWII is just annoyingly dumb."
Earwolf,34jpry,Mudfap,3,Sat May 2 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"I think the bit has gone stale too, but it'd take way more than that to make me stop liking Howard. He'd have to start saying terrible things about people or come out as a nazi or something."

Earwolf,34heu5,sleepsholymountain,2,Fri May 1 16:47:33 2015 UTC,I think the same could be said about Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Both Conan and Letterman are shells of what they used to be. And I feel bad about saying that because I am such a huge Conan fan and I STILL watch the show. It's just that the old Late Night show was something special.
Earwolf,34heu5,jpatton89,4,Sat May 2 03:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the old Late Night Conan show was really weird in its own way. Late Night Letterman was very sardonic and subversive, while Conan was just really surreal. His old show felt like it took place in its own little universe. He had recurring characters with bizarre premises, recurring bits that made no sense, a monologue style with a weird energy where his reactions to the audience's reactions were funnier than the jokes, and an intimate, relatively small studio in the middle of 30 Rock. I loved when he would go out into New York City or Long Island to shoot segments. Conan was my Letterman. I'm too young to have actually watched Letterman when he was on NBC, I've just watched a bunch of clips of it online."

Lennon's mother, Julia Lennon, taught her son to play the banjo and then showed Lennon and Eric Griffiths how to tune their guitars in a similar way to the banjo, and taught them simple chords and songs.

I only say that because he has been known to be drunk while improving in the past, and that live appearance he definitely seemed drunk or on something."

Any episodes with Zach Woods, Tim Meadows, Lennon Parham, Jon Gabrus, Ben Schwartz, Paul Rust, Stephanie Allynne, Gil Ozeri or John Gemberling are bound to be solid."

Tim Meadows for instance is ridiculously good on I4H. Jon Gabrus can turn any scene into a disgusting mess.   PFT is still a guest I'd take over a lot of others but it's a two way street. I'd take many other people over PFT on I4H specifically."
Earwolf,349qqs,ReliableSource,9,Wed Apr 29 13:25:18 2015 UTC,"PFT by his own admission has no formal improv training, and UCB has a pretty specific style, so it makes sense to me that he might not be the best fit for a show filled with mostly UCB people."

Earwolf,349qqs,Slayner,6,Wed Apr 29 15:32:24 2015 UTC,Well... When /u/lnstergraham made their comment about recommending other guests/episodes before PFT because he didn't fully believe PFT was the best place to start. /u/jarluch then commented and said PFT was great on I4H.   Now here comes me with too much free time I decided to comment with my basic opinion that while I agreed he was indeed great on I4H I more so agreed with /u/lnstergraham that he's not the best place to start. My reasons being that other guests such as Tim Meadows or Jon Gabrus are arguably better than Mr Tompkins in my opinion.   Now here comes some bumbling fool /u/reliablesource who agreed with what I said but worded it in such a way that I thought he was disagreeing with my opinion. So I commented back reinforcing my opinion that he is indeed good but I strongly believe other guests are a better starting point.   /u/reliablesource then replied assuring me that he fully agrees with my opinion but he was just pointlessly adding on to my comment.   Realizing that we got into a conundrum of both pointlessly commenting I added yet another pointless comment hoping that /u/reliablesource would have nothing more to say.   That's when he came up with the most frustrating request known to man. 'speak on that' he said.   And thus I did.

Earwolf,34930i,poprocksandfolk,9,Wed Apr 29 07:17:58 2015 UTC,I refuse to take Analyze Phish off my podcast list. God damn I miss that little guy.
Earwolf,34930i,Mizghetti,3,Wed Apr 29 15:07:23 2015 UTC,I just removed it the other day ...
Earwolf,34930i,Steapenhyll,7,Wed Apr 29 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"I just can't. I feel like I'll miss out on some best of or special episode or something.   I really wish they would have done an episode on one of Earwolf shows where everyone just talked about Harris and the crazy shit he did for like two hours. I think that's the weirdest part of all of this, when you listen to a podcast every week, these people start feeling like one of your friends. And then something horrible like this happens and you feel empty because you don't get that closure you need. These people aren't your friends, and you most likely will never have any personal relationship with them. So you just sit there wanting to talk about all the amazing memories you have of Harris, but no one you know has any idea who he is."
Earwolf,34930i,Mizghetti,4,Wed Apr 29 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad we had such direct (unfettered by excessive editing, writing, gatekeepers, etc.) access to him for as long as we did through podcasts. If he had been working in the 90s, then most likely he would have just been some TV writer to us."
Earwolf,34930i,Steapenhyll,3,Wed Apr 29 20:37:31 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I want Oliver Podcast hosts to talk about Harris more. Its like they think the listeners dont want to hear anything sad.. I would love a long episode where they make fun of Phish and talk about harris. Maybe on CBB
Earwolf,34930i,siriusthinking,5,Wed Apr 29 23:57:54 2015 UTC,I'd love a big memorial episode of something after a year.  I'm sure that most of them aren't ready to do something too big yet.

Earwolf,34930i,Mizghetti,2,Thu Apr 30 03:00:56 2015 UTC,I really only listen to that if there is a guest that I am interested in. Do they talk about Harris on that episode?
Earwolf,34930i,peon_taking_credit,2,Thu Apr 30 03:06:17 2015 UTC,It's a remembering Harris episode.
Earwolf,34930i,Mizghetti,2,Thu Apr 30 03:07:30 2015 UTC,"Grabbing it, thanks for the head's up."
Earwolf,34930i,pdxsean,6,Thu Apr 30 04:27:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't found anything new, but it is funny you mention it because I had a chance ""meeting"" with a fellow Harris fan on /r/askportland, a fairly small local sub-subreddit. It was a real touching surprise to receive the ""RIP Harris"" response, and it reminded me how much his death touched me.  Plus it's nice to know we're always out there. And when in fifteen years everyone realized Harris' genius, we'll be like those guys who have Mitch Hedberg ticket stubs from 1997. We loved Harris before it was cool."
Earwolf,34930i,Elaine_Benes_,9,Wed Apr 29 11:23:14 2015 UTC,Yes.   One of my Facebook friends and I accidentally started a comment chain where we now post something he said/wrote to each other every couple of days. I never want it to end
Earwolf,34930i,JasmineForsythe,13,Wed Apr 29 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"Of course. You'd have a tough time finding anyone on here who doesn't. Almost every day I think of one of my favorite Earwolf bits, it usually traces back to Harris, and I get pensive.   I've taken two things from his death, and how much it's impacted people who didn't even know him personally. The first is that I'll always stay away from hard drugs. The second is that I'm going to do my absolute damndest to pursue what makes me happy in life, hoping that maybe my art can mean as much to one other person as Harris' did to me."
Earwolf,34930i,Elaine_Benes_,8,Wed Apr 29 12:42:46 2015 UTC,"I love drugs almost as much as Harris does but have never tried opiates. His story really scares me because it could be me. It could be any happy friendly stoner out there who experiments and then suddenly realizes they are in too deep. Be careful guys.  (I know Harris had a lot of shit going on when he started using, I just mean the happy stoner stereotype)"

Earwolf,34930i,Elaine_Benes_,6,Wed Apr 29 16:53:52 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I am a recreational drug user and his Pete holmes story made me realise how quickly things can get bad. Never going to try opiates for this reason...
Earwolf,34930i,mgh245,4,Wed Apr 29 23:54:39 2015 UTC,One of my friends who has never done drugs was saying that that interview made him realize what addiction really means. When someone like Harris is willing to go to the worst parts of town to pick up random strangers (and get robbed over and over again). I'm definitely too scared to ever do pills now.
Earwolf,34930i,thecolorifix,2,Thu Apr 30 00:07:05 2015 UTC,I had honestly been seriously considering it until I heard that episode...
Earwolf,34930i,DressedLikeACow,7,Fri May 1 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I was thinking how much I miss him because it's been long enough that, if he were alive, it would be weird if he hadn't appeared on a podcast in this amount of time."
Earwolf,34930i,GiantDeviantPiano,6,Wed Apr 29 13:05:41 2015 UTC,"Searching his name in itunes brings up a pretty good list of podcasts, both free and paid that he's been on, I'm not sure that any of them would be ""obscure"" to this group though. I see that there's an audiobook version of the Humblebrag book, though, I didn't know that before. Has anyone listened to it?"
Earwolf,34930i,House_Of_Pies,8,Wed Apr 29 14:28:28 2015 UTC,"I have actually listened to his humblebrag audiobook.

As a kid from TX who has also struggled with opiate dependency, I can relate to his story more than any other comic's and I felt like I might as well have known him over the past few years.

Chimpanzee's genus name is Pans  (genus as in the first word of the Latin name) which is hilarious that it matches with Howard's gu nomenclature. I was at the zoo the other day calling bonobos noebs so I felt very involved. Although technically noebs are also in the Pans genus.   If you want to know more about noebs, y'all should listen to the Hound Tall ep about Polyamory. They are wonderful creatures"

Earwolf,3485bn,GeorgeTaylorG,3,Wed Apr 29 03:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah the last episode Stard was the Co-Host on Twooch because Kulap was apparently filming a movie or something and it's what made me have this realization where... My god, he's making sense to me.   through Whooch and Twooch I got a whole new appreciation for Brett too, I knew he was the head engineer and could play along on most podcasts, but damn he's a pretty awesome guy himself."
Earwolf,3485bn,airJordan45,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:08:59 2015 UTC,"You should try and listen to the building a track episodes of the Rafflecast.  Jon Daly, a guest, and Stard write and record a new track within the course of the podcast.  Stard usually plays all the instruments and mixes the final track and it's amazing (Brandon Small's, Van Halen ep is the best place to start!)"
Earwolf,3485bn,Anangryman,10,Wed Apr 29 19:18:15 2015 UTC,"I finally gave that show a chance a few months ago and I'm really glad I did.  Howard is so freaking funny, plus him and Kulap have really great chemistry together."
Earwolf,3485bn,Anangryman,2,Wed Apr 29 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I pushed this one back for awhile not thinking I would like it. But it's basically in my top 5 or so. It'll be so nice to get fully caught up though, I got about 200 more or so counting two charted. So I guess I'm like halfway through."
Earwolf,3485bn,Prax150,2,Wed Apr 29 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't go back to start from the beginning.  This show doesn't really have as many ""in-jokes"" as some of the other Earwolf shows so you're kind of able to just jump right on"
Earwolf,3485bn,pilksahoy,3,Wed Apr 29 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"I just like to start back from the beginning. It's just a personal thing.   I don't mind at all though, there have been some GOLDEN episodes at the start. Plus I hear chart goose, pinata, darts, roulette, and whatnot aren't a thing in the current format and that's a damn shame because they're some of the funniest things I've ever heard on a podcast.   Anyway if you have too much free time for listening to copious amounts of podcasts I recommend checking it out. You can noticeably tell how much Howard changes throughout the show.   Like the unveiling of the clench, and his summah ideas unfold.   It's honestly such a joy catching up on this show IMO"
Earwolf,3485bn,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Wed Apr 29 01:57:20 2015 UTC,It did the same thing and it took me a fair amount of episode to figure out why they called Engineer Cody Brett Stard. But the mystery was sort of half the fun.

Not sure which ones you're up to, but I use the plug life ideology to reduce douche minutia (although noise cancelling headphones, not just plugs).  Whenever I have to go out in public without and hear traffic noises, people noises etc. I really regret forgetting my headphones."

While the third act on so many are great, and you don't want to ruin the pace of an episode with that game, so many characters are just so damn funny playing it.

Earwolf,345nwq,thelostdolphin,7,Tue Apr 28 15:10:48 2015 UTC,Is that all payroll or just for hosts and such? They've got a decent amount of support staff that also would be paid.
Earwolf,345nwq,Antonton,20,Tue Apr 28 15:13:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, scratch those figures. Now revenue is over $10,000,000 a year (http://www.influencereconomy.com/2014/04/24/launching-a-podcast-network-with-earwolf-jeff-ullrich/).   Ullrich said they paid out $300K to podcasters in 2013 in a prior inteview, so that wouldn't include operating costs/staff salaries, etc. It must be considerably more now that revenue is ten times higher than just a year or two ago."
Earwolf,345nwq,thelostdolphin,23,Tue Apr 28 15:18:01 2015 UTC,i would have never guessed revenues were that high. that's awesome!
Earwolf,345nwq,jerkministan,10,Tue Apr 28 15:20:03 2015 UTC,7M monthly downloads as of that article (likely more now) = lots of advertising money.

Earwolf,345nwq,plant_man,5,Tue Apr 28 18:12:24 2015 UTC,Midroll is the overarching company that aligns shows with advertisers. That's where the money comes from.
Earwolf,345nwq,thelostdolphin,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:37:03 2015 UTC,I guess the point is that Midroll doesn't just work with Earwolf.  They have Revenue steams from other podcasts / Networks

Earwolf,345nwq,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Wed Apr 29 04:07:28 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Maybe you're right. That could be total 2014 revenue for all the podcasts Midroll handles.

Earwolf,345nwq,nickrami,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:41:53 2015 UTC,"I missed that, but now that I'm looking more closely at it, he says that they went from only $19,000 in 2010 to $190,000 revenue in 2011 to $1M in 2012, so the vast majority of that would have been paid out in 2012-2013 when they became substantially more profitable, and all of that is a drop in the bucket compared with how much they are bringing in now."
Earwolf,345nwq,thelostdolphin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:45:50 2015 UTC,"That's probably true, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were paying out $300K-$500K per year to their artists now. I still doubt anyone except maybe Scott Aukerman and the HDTGM guys are making a living wage from Earwolf podcasts."
Earwolf,345nwq,nickrami,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:56:13 2015 UTC,"Well they're all doing other things in film/tv/standup/writing etc so no matter how much, it's still a supplement. It's probably a profit share thing where they make money relative to their respective shows' listeners since that's directly related to how much advertisers will pay to be on a show.   I'm just thinking that if 300k was paid out when they were a modest reflection of what they've become over the last year or two, it stands to reason that their pay outs have doubled if not tripled, relative to their increased success."

Earwolf,345nwq,zeel2314,4,Wed Apr 29 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"There's a really interesting calculator on Midroll's website were you plug in inputs and get an estimate of earnings potential. I was dicking around with it after someone showed it to me and it's actually pretty cool.  Just off a cursory scan of HDTGM on SoundCloud, it looks like they average a bit over 200k streams an ep there. Assuming that's about equivalent to downloads (no idea if that's accurate or not), and conservatively picking one pre-roll and one mid-roll ad, it gives you $3.5k to $6.5k per episode. Now, I'm sure those numbers are a bit inflated as the website's trying to get podcasters to join up but still, based on that, the huge shows are definitely making decent money."
Earwolf,345nwq,pumpkinoatmeal,3,Wed Apr 29 01:00:53 2015 UTC,"Soundcloud (as far as I can see) is nowhere near the full picture.  I think it counts only those played through soundcloud.com - not anything from a podcast feed.    I assume HDTGM gets a lot of plays that was from more casual podcast listeners who don't use a podcast app etc. That's a very accessible pod, so I expect their SC playcount to be inflated compared to other pods  I wouldn't be surprised if they get more than double the listeners shown on soundcloud   A relatively unknown podcast (Huff and Stapes) on the toad hop network revealed on their last episode (in 2012) that they were getting 100k downloads a week.  A few years later, and regularly near the top of the iTunes comedy charts I'd expect HDTGM's downloads to be substantial."
Earwolf,345nwq,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Wed Apr 29 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agree that SoundCloud listens are way under actual total downloads. Just auditor's instinct over here, lowballing it to get a baseline projection.   Taking the median of the above range, $5k an episode, times 26-ish eps a year, divided by three hosts (if that's how it works...honestly no clue about this), that's around $45k each annually. Being extremely conservative. It's safe to say that the bigger Earwolf hosts do make ""real income"" from their shows."
Earwolf,345nwq,pumpkinoatmeal,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:46:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 5k an ep is a good lowball estimate based on that model on their website.  By that logic CBB would make 260k per year and that all goes to one host.  Wonder how that works with Scott as he has a part of the company and is also once of the artists."
Earwolf,345nwq,GiantDeviantPiano,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:04:10 2015 UTC,"Most of that money goes to Earwolf to cover employees, rent, server costs, etc. There's no way the HDTGM hosts are making 45K per year each."
Earwolf,345nwq,nickrami,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:31:01 2015 UTC,My statement is from my understanding of this frequently asked question from their FAQ page
Earwolf,345nwq,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Thu Apr 30 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do. I actually used to think it was more of a side gig for most of the hosts and but it seems like some of the hosts are actually able to make some significant money off of it, which is great!    Based on the sources I've seen (which definitely involve some speculation, so take it with a grain of salt) podcasts with big audiences can make several thousand per episode (as in, audiences for flagship shows like CBB and HDTGM).  Obviously there are a lot of costs involved as well with the high production values of Earwolf shows.  Also, those are the highest grossing shows... I have no idea what the revenues are smaller audience shows and new shows."
Earwolf,345nwq,newprofile15,3,Thu Apr 30 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"I actually used to think it was more of a side gig for most of the hosts    I thought the same, that it was a great way to get their names out there, but not really a paying gig.  I learn something from this sub every day!  Well... maybe every week."
Earwolf,345nwq,siriusthinking,5,Tue Apr 28 15:29:39 2015 UTC,They make quite a bit. Comedy bang bang probably pulls in 5 to 8k Rev for a Monday show
Earwolf,345nwq,MikeyObviously,2,Tue Apr 28 16:27:14 2015 UTC,Is HDTGM? the most financially successful cast on the network? The soundcloud numbers are crazy.
Earwolf,345nwq,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,-1,Tue Apr 28 15:32:15 2015 UTC,Generally people who do podcasts use it for promotion or as a launching point into something else. They aren't doing it (directly) for the money. I can't imagine them making much on ads when it's the same squarespace/audible ads over and over.

Earwolf,346512,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Wed Apr 29 00:42:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, it was really hard to get excited about their solo episodes. Their recent group episodes have been great, but I wonder if the solos deterred people from listening any longer."
Earwolf,346512,Slayner,4,Wed Apr 29 01:04:51 2015 UTC,Not just the solos but that 6 month period where they prerecorded episodes was a very dull period.   I've enjoyed the last month or so of episodes a lot though I hope listeners pick up again.
Earwolf,346512,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Wed Apr 29 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"I still listened through most of the 6 months but there was definitely a lack of energy in them when they were recording ~4 a day.   The solos were good, but they're not the same. These latest ones are great though, really back to the old magic.  From your other comment, are you not a fan of David? I think he's hilarious, had a great Doug loves movies appearance recently."
Earwolf,346512,Cantkillabullmoose,5,Wed Apr 29 03:12:35 2015 UTC,I thought he did good on doug loves movies! I'm excited for his new special too!
Earwolf,346512,Slayner,2,Wed Apr 29 12:40:07 2015 UTC,"No no I actually personally love David, but this sub has a serious hatred for him so I was just being the voice of reason saying he was pretty damn funny this episode.   and I actually enjoy the solo's all except Tig's mostly (sorry Tig, but your life is just too mushy to listen to a lot of the time; in her own words though, stop listening you idiot)   Anyway I really like PB, the 6 months were the only dark period IMO but otherwise I've been extremely pleased with the podcast. Especially lately.   My only wish is that Kyle would do more characters like he used to."
Earwolf,346512,GiantDeviantPiano,5,Wed Apr 29 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people here don't like David here. I don't get it, I'm really looking forward to his kickstarted being finished  Tig's solos were great, I could listen to a Tig and Stephanie spin off podcast where they talk about their soft furnishings and make eating bets that they never follow up on.   Kyle's bits seem to recycle to fast these days he doesn't go back to the well as much as he's creating new stuff all the time.  I do miss the classics, a couple of times recently I wanted teach to show up and talk to the guest"
Earwolf,346512,Slayner,4,Wed Apr 29 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"Oh my god teach was the best! And so short lived.   I don't hate hearing about tigs life or anything, just in the solo episode format it wasn't totally my thing. It's whatever though.   I'd give anything to hear name that punky again."
Earwolf,346512,Slayner,4,Wed Apr 29 04:23:58 2015 UTC,I am kind of new to this sub - I don't see that many people commenting on PB episodes. BUT WHO WOULDN'T LOVE DAVID!? He works so well with Tig & Kyle.
Earwolf,346512,Slayner,3,Wed Apr 29 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"Well I've made some professor blastoff discussion threads in the past and the general consensus is that he's too serious and isn't funny and whatnot.   I mean it's whatever, personally for how off the walls PB gets they Need David to keep it on the rails at the very least but I think he can usually lead tig or Kyle into some pretty hilarious things himself, so really the dynamic between the 3 is perfect.   Hold on let me see if I can find an old thread I posted on here with general professor blastoff opinions.  Edit: Jesus god damned christ I post here way too often. Anyway I found it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/2bsqpb/are_there_many_professor_blastoff_fans_on_here/  Anyway that's just one example of many, look back into old episode discussion threads and you'll see similar comments about David."
Earwolf,346512,TvsPhil,3,Wed Apr 29 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah with this topic I'm always a bit hesitant for it to be too 'touchy feely' and uh, idk how to explain it but not my cup of tea. But Ian here was a great guest that got his point across while still letting the group do their thing.   Really a perfectly good episode IMO. Group dynamic, dumb puns, making fun of Kyle, even David was pretty funny through the whole thing. And again the guest allowed all this while still getting their points across in a good way.   C+"

Earwolf,346512,TvsPhil,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"I think the reason I never jumped into Professor Blastoff despite loving Tig is that my assumption is it'd become really frustrating to listen to them discuss topics I may know something about and the discussion being really one dimensional, even with experts."
Earwolf,346512,Slayner,2,Wed Apr 29 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"they're not really experts. Very seldom do they actually have someone on who knows what they're talking about.   It's actually to the point where it's almost an inside joke that the show even has a topic at times. There was an episode a few weeks ago where they literally only mentioned the topic twice or three times the whole episode.   You can take it as a good thing or a bad thing, but I just think of it as -- It's a comedy podcast, let me just laugh and not stress over anything else.   All in all I like it, but there are times where you seriously do roll your eyes at how little they know."

Her first ep did provide some amazing story but she seems to get stuck on some improv things and then block others from actually moving the story along.

Earwolf,3408cn,Slayner,14,Mon Apr 27 23:48:06 2015 UTC,Eddie Lee Capers Prime was just unbelievable the whole episode. This is one where I was laughing out loud throughout the whole episode.

I know people didn't really like how much Cameron talks about being a lesbian in her last appearance, but she really brought her game today and was hilarious during the interview segment before the weirdos showed up. Gourley is also in my top CBB(and everything else too) players with how fast his mind works and how well he bounces off everyone without hesitation. Best of material for sure"

I think this episode was pigeon-holed into a certain story line that was getting a little too complicated fast, and Gourley was not hitting the right notes. I know that was part of the joke and they turned things around, but are far as the amazing improv I get from CBB, it wasn't as crisp as most of PFT's.  Just my opinion. I still thought it was funny, and I don't get the Caramel hate. She's not great, and I think she also seemed to force bits a bit. Oh well."
Earwolf,3408cn,Quinez,3,Tue Apr 28 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"Gourley is amazing at being absurd and intelligent and developing a character, but he's not great at developing a narrative.  This episode quickly established its premise but then had nowhere to go.  It's why I think he's especially good in The Dead Authors Podcast and The Andy Daly PPP, where the storylines are largely established beforehand and he can just roll with them.    I think Gourley would be good with someone like Sanz or Lapkus... they are both completely unafraid to blurt out whatever is on their mind and force the other improvisers to massage the mess into a new direction."

The analogy is falling apart as I try and continue it, because it isn't a very good one. But society is both against women and homosexuals, she happens to be both, and is constantly reminded of it by facing hardships on a daily basis. Not that it's insurmountable or an extreme hardship, but I guarantee you it comes up more than being a Canadian expatriate.   Also these same people aren't complaining about (any male comedian ever save maybe PFT) constantly bringing up their dicks, which I think is a better analogy. Sexuality (with the default of course being heterosexuality) comes up with most comedians very often."

Earwolf,3408cn,gs-fl-bi,-22,Mon Apr 27 15:43:37 2015 UTC,wow you people are really aggressive with not liking women
Earwolf,3408cn,Pluppets,11,Mon Apr 27 15:48:43 2015 UTC,Nothing he said suggests that he doesn't like women. I'm not sure if you realize the person you're replying to is not the person who made the original comment. He just doesn't find her that funny as a comedian. There is nothing wrong with that.
Earwolf,3408cn,gs-fl-bi,-19,Mon Apr 27 16:07:31 2015 UTC,whatever you say
Earwolf,3408cn,CollDoll123,8,Mon Apr 27 17:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't even particularly dislike her comedy.  I don't enjoy it, but I'm a dumb straight white male so I don't think I'm in the target demographic.  The people who enjoy what she does certainly seem to really like it.  Also, in the interest of transparency, I have known and worked with Cameron.  She's super likable and a very positive person to be around.  I am not a fan of her comedy, but it does not surprise me that many people are.  But stop throwing around ""misogyny"" and shit like that like it's fucking penny candy.  It devalues the term and it devalues the concept."

Earwolf,340ddq,requisite_monocle,3,Mon Apr 27 17:33:01 2015 UTC,I wonder if that will become part of the show eventually. I do wonder if the guests are usually sticking around for the improv portion. I'm pretty sure Jason Ritter stayed. I see no reason why you couldn't have the guest play a role in the improv portion unless they just didn't feel comfortable doing so.
Earwolf,340ddq,weaglebeagle,19,Tue Apr 28 19:15:05 2015 UTC,"I just came from the Unpopular Opinions thread and after reading 9 paragraphs on why Spontaneanation is mediocre at best, I just have to say I absolutely loved this ep and I love this podcast."
Earwolf,340ddq,wafflesocks,12,Mon Apr 27 18:51:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, wasn't that kind of dispiriting? I love Paul's monologues, and the narrative improv is fun. It's not always hilarious but I appreciate its relaxed, low-key atmosphere."
Earwolf,340ddq,JasmineForsythe,3,Mon Apr 27 19:00:46 2015 UTC,"I never said it was mediocre at best, I was just pointing out the difference in improv style. I liked this episode a lot."
Earwolf,340ddq,Mudfap,5,Mon Apr 27 20:31:29 2015 UTC,"Looking back, my comment does sound directed at you specifically, but I was just referring to the amount of spont comments in general. I definitely don't begrudge anyone for having an opinion, but it made me want to throw some love out there for the podcast!"
Earwolf,340ddq,wafflesocks,2,Mon Apr 27 20:51:10 2015 UTC,No worries. I know I got a bit long-winded.
Earwolf,340ddq,Mudfap,2,Mon Apr 27 21:24:48 2015 UTC,"At worse, Spont is a charming interview (I think every guest is delighted by PFT, and by diffusion makes me delighted) with an heightened improvised narrative that makes for breezy listening thanks to the score (even if the scene isn't funny, it is kind of interesting to see how it unfolds). At best, it's ep 4 Savannah, Georgia."
Earwolf,340ddq,requisite_monocle,8,Mon Apr 27 20:37:01 2015 UTC,Pleased by the return of 'From a deli owner that's a rave.'

Earwolf,340ddq,johnnyawful,6,Mon Apr 27 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"Preparing myself for the downvotes with this but by far the weakest episode, the odd funny moment but nothing like the other episodes, especially Episode 1."
Earwolf,340ddq,jackdall,6,Tue Apr 28 17:05:58 2015 UTC,I think the narrative was weakened when they got confused about whether they were supposed to be a non-traditional couple pretending to be traditional or vice versa.
Earwolf,340ddq,tkdgns,6,Tue Apr 28 21:42:32 2015 UTC,Agree but to be honest it wasn't in any way strong leading up to that point.
Earwolf,340ddq,jackdall,8,Wed Apr 29 12:46:17 2015 UTC,"Yup. I think they just really didn't start with a good premise and they were floundering for a long time trying to get things to stick.  It had a couple good laughs but like you said, not as good as previous eps."
Earwolf,340ddq,House_Of_Pies,5,Tue Apr 28 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. I listened to the first 4 episodes almost back to back, but then when this one came out yesterday I was very disappointed."

Earwolf,340ddq,jarluch,3,Tue Apr 28 23:52:06 2015 UTC,The colors don't really match?
Earwolf,340ddq,branmuffinzed,-1,Mon Apr 27 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"How so? It's purple green and yellow. Maybe it doesn't show up as well on the pic but it's definitely the same colors, just in different order."
Earwolf,340ddq,tkdgns,2,Mon Apr 27 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"Not really... It's got the green and yellow, but I'm more inclined to agree with the above post comparing it to the Wimbledon thing. Plus the lettering is similar."
Earwolf,34192z,spinney,13,Mon Apr 27 14:44:38 2015 UTC,it's a biweekly show from what I understand. so new ep next week.
Earwolf,34192z,dandy_johnson,5,Mon Apr 27 14:54:30 2015 UTC,Biweekly seems like the perfect schedule for this show.

Earwolf,33yenh,jarluch,5,Sun Apr 26 20:41:57 2015 UTC,I have no clue what's happening in the threads but the Jon Gabrus ep was a podcast of the year contender
Earwolf,33yenh,Doesntgetredditatall,13,Mon Apr 27 04:21:29 2015 UTC,"I'm trying guys, I really am.  But I don't get this show."
Earwolf,33yenh,Anangryman,19,Sun Apr 26 23:42:36 2015 UTC,"There's been a few ""I don't get it"" threads about HH, and I can totally get people not being into this show. It has a very specific sensibility that's apparently very polarizing. The mix of the great chemistry between Sean and Hayes and the strange, childish sense of humour just tickles my funny business something wicked. But just like with Mr. Show and Asimov's foundation series, none of my friends that I've recommended the show find it particularly great. It is incredibly annoying, actually.  Personally, I'd say that the Scott Aukerman/Jeff Ulrich episode of HH is just about the funniest episode of anything I've ever heard or seen, so if it doesn't appeal to you then it's probably time to try something else."
Earwolf,33yenh,mak_marin,7,Mon Apr 27 00:23:17 2015 UTC,Your friends are wrong about Mr. Show obviously.
Earwolf,33yenh,sleepsholymountain,3,Mon Apr 27 05:08:30 2015 UTC,It's weird because the Scott and Jeff episode of HH is really the only one I've liked.
Earwolf,33yenh,Ed_Sullivision,6,Mon Apr 27 15:33:55 2015 UTC,"The mix of the great chemistry between Sean and Hayes and the strange, childish sense of humour just tickles my funny business something wicked.   I think this is the perfect way to explain what makes this show so great to me too. The whole uppity Hollywood satire thing isn't the reason it's funny. Sean and Hayes are just freakishly hilarious and work together so so well. And they're really nice and smart."
Earwolf,33yenh,WhosCountin,16,Mon Apr 27 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"I can't even pinpoint a specific episode or moment that did it, but I kept plodding through the early episodes and the show just clicked the funny switch in my brain.  Just the way the speak is funny now.  It's what I listen to every night while getting ready for bed now.  I can absolutely understand not getting/liking it though."
Earwolf,33yenh,siriusthinking,6,Mon Apr 27 00:31:55 2015 UTC,"I listened to Sean and Hayes on WSGLL, then they showed up on CBB ads and I loved everything I had heard so far. I jumped in with the Adam Pally episode, but didn't quite ""get it"" so I switched over to Episode 1 after maybe 10 minutes.    Pretty much from the start episode 1 was getting more audible laughs out of me than almost any podcast I'd listened to. That was around a week ago, and I've probably listened to 3 episodes a day on average since then. I was shocked to find that so many people don't like it. It's not their Hollywood ""characters"" that I find so funny. I just think that the constant bits and their banter are pretty much perfectly aligned with my sense of humor."
Earwolf,33yenh,WhosCountin,4,Mon Apr 27 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"I am 100% the same way. Tried jumping in a couple times, didn't get it. When the PFT, Again episode came out, I have it another try. I found it funny, but not amazing. Went back to Ep 1, and when Jake Johnson said he was 350 pounds working at an airport bar, something about that just broke something. Then there's a big switch a couple of episodes later in the Adam Pally episode where he's (purposefully) not going along with the guys and Sean says ""Talk to us on the forums, did you like the way Adam treated us?"" And he sounds so hilariously vulnerable.   I think they get a lot of ish for it being two guys acting like pompous assholes, but if you really listen to things like ""Ehhh, wrong"" and when they're trying to mine info about how the Gilmore Guys get people to listen, the characters themselves are no longer actually pompous, it's like they're playing characters as characters. Yeah, I'll stick with that nonsense."
Earwolf,33yenh,imfromtn,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"You'll wanna listen to their first podcast too, then. the reality SHOW show (on Earwolf). It's good if you like reality TV, but even if you don't, you'll love it."
Earwolf,33yenh,phisho873,2,Tue May 5 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, that will come when I finish HH. If I listen to them at the same time, I'll lose both at once. This way when I finish the whole backlog of HH, I know I still have more Hayes and Sean to have me going and bussin up my whole shit"
Earwolf,33yenh,WhosCountin,2,Wed May 6 01:06:53 2015 UTC,"Yea I am trying my best to get into this show.  I have listened to like 5 episodes the past few days.  I have also gotten into the habit of listening while I am getting ready for bed, or just kind of doing things around my apartment.  It's really hard to get where the jokes are, it kind of reminds me of Topics.  They are both so dedicated to their cocky Hollywood persona's that it takes a few episodes to start to get all of their wackiness (which I am still having a hard time catching)."
Earwolf,33yenh,1live4downvotes,29,Tue Apr 28 01:25:37 2015 UTC,"EHHHH! Wrong! You do get this show, because you is nerds and nerds is cool now. Sean and Hayes are nice and funny and smart, and jocks is pumping their gas."
Earwolf,33yenh,TheBlackSpank,21,Mon Apr 27 01:13:29 2015 UTC,"Super cool that any time someone says they don't get the humor of this show, they have all the injokes thrown at them."

Earwolf,33yenh,TheBlackSpank,12,Mon Apr 27 02:15:05 2015 UTC,The in-jokes are really fun but I could see how it could be really fucking annoying.  I like to give joke response and then a genuine response to lessen the obnoxiousness.
Earwolf,33yenh,changry_perdvert,9,Mon Apr 27 03:46:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it is cool. And very nice and smart.    But in all seriousness, I think HH appeals to a very specific kind of annoying idiot/harmless asshole. People who basically have thrown themselves so far down the stupid humor rabbit hole that sincerity no longer exists. I include myself in this band of maniacs, and I'd have it no other way. Hayes and Sean's sense of humor and bantering style reminds me a lot of my friends and I (though obviously we're not comedic geniuses like them). I think that the reason it's so polarizing is that if you're not into that kind of constant sarcasm/irony it's extremely grating, but if you are into it, the utter lack of sincerity and deadpan devotion to the bit make it funnier than like anything else.    God. It was scary writing about HH in a genuine way. I feel really exposed and I'm worried that a frankingstein or skellington may find me.  TL;DR: Hollywood Handbook really appeals to people like Hayes and Sean who would love to be friends with Hayes and Sean. If you're not one of these people, you probably find them insufferable and so the show and its fanbase just piss you off."
Earwolf,33yenh,WhosCountin,6,Mon Apr 27 20:29:07 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that.    For myself-- and this may be hard to believe, but I am a casual fan of the show. It's at the bottom of my weekly listening rotation, and I pretty much only get to it when there's a guest I really like, but I tend to genuinely enjoy it when I do. Sean and Hayes are undeniably funny.   The vocal fandom with all its ad nauseum joke repetition actually makes it harder for me to enjoy the show itself, I'm afraid.  But that's just me."
Earwolf,33yenh,goofy_ball,6,Mon Apr 27 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"The vocal fandom with all its ad nauseum joke repetition actually makes it harder for me to enjoy the show itself, I'm afraid. But that's just me.   As one of the biggest fans of HH I kinda agree on this point, especially this sub-reddit. One of the 'in-jokes' on HH has been lampooning CBB fans and their tendency to constantly just write references to CBB jokes. ""Great ep, C+"" ""It's been"" etc  Yet all HH fans go around saying jocks is pumping our gas now.  Now, while this is true and nerds is cool now, it's also something that was said once maybe twice in the show but I have seen it a hundred times on this subreddit.  Scoop-troop, take out your pens:  Just enjoy the show and don't feel the need to role play as Sean or Hayes. I know we're all a bit tense from being worried the show was going to get cancelled for so long, but the numbers have been getting better (going by soundcloud) so I think we can all take a chill pill against people who don't like the show.  okay scoop-troop now meet me out back in 30 minutes and we'll stab this son of a bitch"
Earwolf,33yenh,Zsinjeh,2,Tue Apr 28 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"Sean and Hayes are undeniably funny.     I agree, and I feel like I could listen to pretty much anything hosted by them and enjoy it immensely. I was also a film minor in college a few years back, so this specific topic really appeals to me because I'm so knowledgeable about the industry and hooked into that scene (on top of being so smart).     The vocal fandom with all its ad nauseum joke repetition actually makes it harder for me to enjoy the show itself, I'm afraid. But that's just me.     I almost never go on this sub or the earwolf forums for exactly this reason. I just don't enjoy reading hundreds of references, even to stuff I like. I just came on here recently to see how other people felt about HH and was surprised to find the state of affairs."
Earwolf,33yenh,WhosCountin,2,Mon Apr 27 21:22:18 2015 UTC,Wow that really nailed the reason I think I listen. It is a very weird show but it so easily became my favourite podcast due to the humor.
Earwolf,33yenh,CakeBoss16,3,Tue Apr 28 00:08:14 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Turns me off to the show completely.
Earwolf,33yenh,mrbananagrabber1,5,Mon Apr 27 10:14:46 2015 UTC,"With regards to the Eh, Wrong! segment specifically, the self deprecation inherent in that bit gets lost when it's interneted. The way they do it on the show, it's a clever way to acknowledge criticism while maintaining an arrogant façade. The Eh, Wrong! they did on the episode after the Pauly Shore episode is a good example."

Earwolf,33yenh,TakeItToTheMax,5,Sun Apr 26 23:55:31 2015 UTC,"I think 'The Reality Show Show' is the best introduction you'll get into the relationship and humour of Hayes & Sean, because the sections they do with the clips are just funny without needing to get their whole 'shtick'."
Earwolf,33yenh,insults2injury,5,Mon Apr 27 04:20:09 2015 UTC,Here's the best way I've come up with to explain HH to people who don't get it:  *It's two guys in a room trying to make the other guy laugh off-mic by saying the dumbest shit they can think of.  *Sometimes the two guys in the room try to make the engineer laugh or torture the engineer to make the other guy laugh.  *Their guest is either in on what they're trying to do or oblivious to what the fuck is going on.  My enjoyment of HH skyrocketed when I started to listen to it strictly using earbuds. When I heard someone in the room trying to stifle laughter at whatever moronic shit the other guy is saying it clicked for me. I realized almost every ridiculous baseless statement was it's own I4H scene and they never stop trying to top themselves when it comes to feigned idiocy. C+
Earwolf,33yenh,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Tue Apr 28 11:44:05 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect description. It feels like the major focus of the show is just to get the other people in the room to break, which makes it so much fun to listen to."
Earwolf,33yenh,TheBlackSpank,5,Wed Apr 29 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Have you listened to the Jon Gabrus again episode? I think if you dont find that funny, then maybe it isnt for you."

Earwolf,33yenh,gladvillain,2,Mon Apr 27 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"Hollywood Handbook is pretty hit-or-miss for me, but this episode was a massive hit.

Earwolf,33z2jk,willwakef,13,Mon Apr 27 00:02:37 2015 UTC,I've seen so many negative unpopular opinions. I'm gonna go positive unpopular and say I really enjoyed the recent Tom Green CBB episode.
Earwolf,33z2jk,NardsOfDoom,54,Tue Apr 28 05:42:24 2015 UTC,"In terms of CBB, I've gotten a bit tired of the lore heavy episodes. To me, much of the episodes seem like fan service or Scott trying to fill in the listener to continuity of the character, previous ep etc. Also it kinda pigeons holes a lot of guests IMO. Example; Gillian Jacobs is a great guest, (her appearance with Daly, Peele were great), but now we've done her 5th pairing with PFT and IMO the marriage arc has long since become redundant. I'd love to see her with Adomian, or Lapkus again, or Wompler etc. We know how great Moynihan is and how he's a fan of CBB, it'd be great to see him with someone else. It seems like everyone wants to see Time Bobby 9, Mantz/Daly 15, Suicide House 7, etc.   Plus, Scott, Daly have acknowledged they certainly feel the pressure of trying to keep duplicating these moments in previous episodes and how they prefer doing new characters. I'd much rather see different lineups and them mixing it up. Which to be fair, it does seem like Scott has been trying to do that, but often it seems like those episodes illicit mixed feelings."
Earwolf,33z2jk,thlsisnotanexit,11,Mon Apr 27 05:09:07 2015 UTC,I agree that lore seems to get in the way for a lot of repeat characters.  Several Wompler episodes in particular seemed burdened with how much time they had to spend on exposition just catching the listener up.
Earwolf,33z2jk,FugitiveDribbling,3,Mon Apr 27 06:51:33 2015 UTC,I am not a fan of the comic book lore either. There's nothing funny about it. Having Don DiMello be the ultimate evil in the universe or whatever totally undercuts the humor in the character
Earwolf,33z2jk,ShockinglyEfficient,3,Thu May 7 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I hear you."
Earwolf,33z2jk,WeirderScott,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:45:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of characters stop being about whatever they were originally about or what made them likeable and they become about the lore. A little continuing story is delightful. But there's often a moment where suddenly they become too saddled to be anything other than a cluster of references and a comic book-style mess of mythologies.   I'll cite a minor example. Like, I still love Traci Reardon's appearances, and the weird specificity of her two jobs and her piercings and almost everything about her (and I'm so, so glad she escaped being stuck as a character that only exists in the Womplerverse). But it seems that she has become so defined by the bit about living with her dead grandmother, that that's what she's come to be ultimately about, and it makes me a bit sad. It was never my favorite bit, it doesn't seem to lead to many funny situations, and it seems like it always comes back to that of late."
Earwolf,33z2jk,goofy_ball,22,Thu Apr 30 07:56:33 2015 UTC,"Live episodes are terrible, and to me, downright unlistenable. Sounds a bit extreme I'm sure, but I cannot get through one. It just takes away the magic of 3-4 people in a room bs'ing and cracking jokes.   I especially realized this when listening to the live UTU2TM episode.  Or maybe it's just me. Who knows."
Earwolf,33z2jk,jarethcutestory,16,Mon Apr 27 05:39:00 2015 UTC,The only podcast that works well as a live show is How Did This Get Made. It's just fun all around with everyone reacting to the same parts of the movie and it just seems like a fun experience because the audience knows the show so well and gets involved.    Hollywood Handbook had a couple good live episodes mostly because their weirdo forum fans go to the shows.
Earwolf,33z2jk,Numlocks,5,Mon Apr 27 12:38:17 2015 UTC,"This isn't Earwolf but the one p-cast I absolutely love when it's live is You Made It Weird.

When it's live, he could have 5 people I've never heard of and it'll be my first listen on Wednesday."
Earwolf,33z2jk,Prax150,3,Mon Apr 27 13:59:26 2015 UTC,Paul and Jason are also real pros at dealing with a crowd. The Q&A section at the end is always hilarious. Some of our other beloved earwolf hosts don't seem to want to get the audience involved.

Earwolf,33z2jk,WhosCountin,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:55:37 2015 UTC,I don't think you can judge all live episodes on that one. I was listening to that episode for the second time with my dad and realized it was terrible.
Earwolf,33z2jk,sojik,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:34:53 2015 UTC,"I listen to live episodes at a higher speed, or skip them totally.For me, alot of it has to do with the audio quality."

I don't share their musical tastes 99% of the time and skip the song all the time as I think of them as just extra long commercial. I only liked them when they were comedy music acts like Garfunkel & Oates, Tenacious D, and Don't Stop Or We'll Die."

Earwolf,33z2jk,gs-fl-bi,34,Wed Apr 29 04:36:32 2015 UTC,"I'll start.   I like nothing about Spontaneanation so far.  The name, the logo, the format, almost all the guests, everything, has been less than mediocre to me so far. I've listened to every episode so far and haven't enjoyed any of it.  I LOVE PFT and I loved the Pod F. Tompcast, and I was very excited about this at first, but I think I'm going to give up on it pretty soon."
Earwolf,33z2jk,Mudfap,22,Mon Apr 27 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely not an instant fan, but I believe That PFT is one of the funniest humans around right now. It will find its footing, one way or the other.  The first chunk, his monologue and interview are nothing but charming and fun. Watch any episode of Speakeasy and you'll know that he is at home in interview mode.  The improv chunk is somewhat of a different animal. I think listeners have gotten accustomed to UCB style/I4H, game-oriented improv. The objective of 'game' is to propel the story forward by building a grounded scene slowly, and then exploring and building off of the first odd moment that stands out. The players keep things truthful to their reality, while noting that the oddity has occurred and work outwards bearing that communal realization in mind.  Spont's improv is closer to that of Groundlings or Second City to some extent. It is built off character exploration, with hopes that a plot may develop through conversation. This can lead to the possibility of dead ends and readjustment because the players have no communal idea (""group mind"") or goal to work towards or stray from. The beauty of UCB/I4H/game-oriented improv is that the audience bares witness to these ""a-ha moments"" of finding the game from honest spontaneity through truthful grounded thinking. The audience then feels included in the journey through the scene development. With the Spont style of improv, we are left wondering if the performers will be able to wrap any of it into a neat bow.  I think it should go without saying that everyone that has appeared on Spont are great performers and actors, but the improv style might highlight some faults in the character-driven method. There's a reason Del Close is held in such high esteem for creating game-oriented improv. It gives the audience the chance to feel included in the exploration of ideas. Spont's method relies on the hope that character quirks will be interesting enough to explore and build story out of.  Just my two cents. All love to PFT."
Earwolf,33z2jk,sojik,4,Mon Apr 27 00:06:29 2015 UTC,"I like your insights. While I enjoy the show and look forward to it maturing I wasn't quite sure what made the improv part not quite as enjoyable as I4H. Sometimes the characters and situations seem to start out too crazy and then they're stuck in that crazy because they don't do different scenes like I4H where Besser can usually end a scene at the perfect spot (or edit it if he didn't pick the right time live, I bet)."
Earwolf,33z2jk,Lukepatrick88,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:01:15 2015 UTC,Besser is great at spotting deadends and making a continous flow but sometimes it can be a little jarring
Earwolf,33z2jk,splice_of_life,19,Mon Apr 27 06:19:22 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, and see where you're coming from.  In my personal experience, I feel that Spontaneanation demands much more of my attention than the average podcast, as does WSGLL.  I love them, but I need to specifically carve out an hour or two where I do nothing but listen.  It greatly adds to my enjoyment of those shows; otherwise, I get literally nothing but background noise because I lose the thread so easily.  Consider re-listening to the Secret Society ep again as I feel that one was the strongest thus far.  Spontaneanation MVP: Eban Schletter.  Holy moley that dude is great.  I want him doing background music to everything ever.  If you get nothing else out of the show, pay attention to what he's doing.  Worth the price of admission alone."
Earwolf,33z2jk,mark10579,3,Wed May 6 00:29:49 2015 UTC,"I've listened to it in bed in a dark room with none of my senses active but hearing. I'll listen to that ep again though, because I believe I did listen to that in two or three different segments.  I love Eban too, I think he worked much better on the Paul F. Tompcast format however. Nothing against him, I just don't really like the whole dynamic."
Earwolf,33z2jk,mark10579,15,Mon Apr 27 02:03:09 2015 UTC,"I don't hate it but it's so aggressively mediocre to me. And PFT just isn't that great as a host, he gets kinda up his own ass and not in the pretend way he does as a bit.  Plus the general vibe is just so low-energy and the players usually don't seem to play off each other very well"
Earwolf,33z2jk,nohorseman,10,Mon Apr 27 02:13:59 2015 UTC,I hate that I 100% agree with all of this
Earwolf,33z2jk,gammarayman,14,Mon Apr 27 03:23:44 2015 UTC,"Same. I think it's because all his guests seem like such clever, vaguely sophisticated, vanilla people. There's no one goofy like Scott to push him in weird directions with some nonsense. PFT is at his best when he's being pulled in every direction and struggling (but succeeding) to create a cohesive character"
Earwolf,33z2jk,goofy_ball,8,Mon Apr 27 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think people send the scenes in weird, surprising directions, its just kind of more subtle. I'm a big Janet Varney fan, so maybe I was listening for it, but she was quite an improv wildcard in her episodes (1 & 4). Such as in the first ep, I believe someone made an entrance and she named them Rumple Dumpleskin, sending everyone onto their heels and making it unexpected. It's less jarring than Scott's pushes, but certainly a pretty big left turn."
Earwolf,33z2jk,mark10579,3,Mon Apr 27 04:22:15 2015 UTC,I think you hit the nail on the head.
Earwolf,33z2jk,goofy_ball,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:54:51 2015 UTC,Wow that exactly sums up my dislike of Spont. It's almost too crisp. The guests are too good at what they do.
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,3,Mon Apr 27 04:38:12 2015 UTC,"It's so strange to me that I can enjoy his in-character rants as H.G. Wells on Dead Authors so much, but his monologue style on Spontaneanation just falls so flat with me.  Alas."
Earwolf,33z2jk,mark10579,2,Mon Apr 27 14:50:34 2015 UTC,"Dude, agreed. His regular personality really requires someone goofy like Scott to bounce off of. When he's guiding the show without someone throwing out ridiculous shit for him to react to, he just stays at the same level while getting more and more, well, up his own ass"
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,2,Mon Apr 27 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"He seems really quick to go to the well of saying something kind of odd and then getting fake-angry with the listener for thinking something so stupid, and while that apparently is really funny to some, I just don't get it."
Earwolf,33z2jk,goofy_ball,5,Mon Apr 27 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a big PFT fan as well, but haven't enjoyed SPONT at all. This explains a lot of what I feel the reasons are."
Earwolf,33z2jk,paulymeatblls,5,Mon Apr 27 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"To add to it, I feel like every episode contains way too much of the dated, upperclass British accent thing. It's like all of his guests' go-to character, and it makes for such dry humor. Not in an acerbic way either, just kinda bland."
Earwolf,33z2jk,Quinez,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:13:34 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting contrast with i4h. On SPONT it's like everyone is semi-talented and phoning it in, while on i4h they're typically talented and enthusiastic. Makes a big difference."
Earwolf,33z2jk,CakeBoss16,4,Mon Apr 27 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not really getting it either. I don't think I'm in love enough with the FACT OF IMPROV for it to really be for me.  And I adore PFT.  Really enjoy the interview segments, though."
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,3,Mon Apr 27 04:47:06 2015 UTC,I'm enjoying the monologue and interview but the improv is boring.
Earwolf,33z2jk,CakeBoss16,4,Mon Apr 27 02:08:57 2015 UTC,"I always thought I didn't like improv.  Then I listened to improv4humans and I realized I loved improv.  Spontaneanation is what I thought improv was before I listened to improv4humans.    Spontaneanation is goofy, I4H is edgy. Spontaneanation is rounded, I4H is pointy. Spontaneanation is optimistic; I4H is misanthropic. Spontaneanation is Leno and Conan, I4H is Letterman and Ferguson.  Maybe the best way to describe the difference is in terms of the hosts' background laughter:  Spontaneation is a chortle, I4H is a cackle."
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,8,Mon Apr 27 06:40:43 2015 UTC,This should just be a weekly/monthly thread. I frequent r/android and they started a rant Sunday sticky. Helps decrease the overall negativity of the sub.
Earwolf,33z2jk,Teenageboy69,4,Tue Apr 28 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"It has been kind of fun to air our grievances (Festivus-style) but I don't know that the sub being overall negative is accurate. I feel like /r/earwolf is pretty positive overall, definitely not more negative than subs of similar size in my experience.  Then again, maybe ""overall negativity of"" /r/earwolf is your unpopular opinion. :)"
Earwolf,33z2jk,Cantkillabullmoose,2,Tue Apr 28 00:43:57 2015 UTC,I was speaking in regards to r/android not r/earwolf. Earwolf has always been a positive sub but a monthly grievance sticky or something would be cool.
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,22,Wed Apr 29 01:59:39 2015 UTC,"I've stopped liking Tig Notaro.  I don't know what it is, I've seen her live several times and have great memories of laughing and having fun. PB used to be one of my favorite podcasts, I started listening at episode 1. But somehow, over the last year or so, I've stopped caring and started finding her style annoying. The way she loads her podcast with her non-famous non-expert friends is probably the most easily-explained irritation but other things get me too.  I know she's had cancer and c-diff and come back from a lot, I don't want to take that away from her - she is amazing. However I find her just as annoying as David when I listen to PB (for different reasons) and no longer find myself interested in her upcoming career milestones. I'm glad she's famous and doing well, but I won't put the effort into following her anymore."
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,9,Wed Apr 29 02:15:48 2015 UTC,"Tig seems to have gotten, I don't know, very Hollywood. She seems very disinterested in what other people have to say and kind of feels like she's floating by. She loads the podcast with her friends, which I find to be beyond boring at times. It makes me miss Aaron. I also feel bad for how she and Kyle sometimes railroad David.   In the last episode she talked about how when she and Stephanie have a baby she can change her schedule and ""write another book"" and be fine, as if her future success is guaranteed before she even finishes her first book. I couldn't have been turned off more than in that moment.   As previously mentioned, she's an incredible human being, but I'm annoyed."

Earwolf,33z2jk,shadoire,8,Tue Apr 28 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"Kyle Dunnigan is hilarious. However the rest of the show often is too much work to get to his bits. I doubt he'll splinter off any time soon, he and Tig appear to be best of friends and very loyal to one another."
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,4,Tue Apr 28 04:00:52 2015 UTC,Without Kyle I doubt I would listen to the show to be honest.
Earwolf,33z2jk,bloody_noodle,4,Mon Apr 27 05:52:45 2015 UTC,"Kyle is so hilarious. I was lucky enough to meet him in person and briefly converse with him when I went to his show in Portland last year. He was standing outside the venue waiting to go in and I said hi and chatted.   He's kind of short - maybe 5' 8"" so not bad (the same as me) but you always expect celebrities to be tall - and I said something to that effect. ""I thought you would be taller than me!""  The sidewalk we were on was somewhat on a hill, so he took two steps uphill and said ""Well it's because I am."" In his usual deadpan matter-of-fact way. Just hilarious. But yeah, kind of a small guy. He needs to work those quads and delts and put in his numbers.  His show was hilarious, really great guy, put in a solid 75 minute set despite the fact that the venue was 3/4 empty."
Earwolf,33z2jk,revilo23,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to be a guest on Professor Blastoff, so met them all via the phone. Would love to meet him (and the others) in person one day - but I live in Australia. I still adore the show, I think they have a great dynamic between them, but I think the show would suffer without Kyle. I think he's one of the most naturally gifted comedians I've ever come across."
Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,2,Tue Apr 28 00:15:13 2015 UTC,"I especially like Kyle because he seems to really have his act together, despite his spacey goofy persona. I feel like he's a true professional. While many comedians will continue their running jokes long past the time when they are funny, Kyle appears to understand when a joke has run its course and is not afraid to retire it early. ""Name That Punky"" for example was a fan favorite I think we all agree died before its time... however if he had run it another five or six times we'd have gotten tired of it. There have been lots of examples of this with Kyle.  The sad part of that is, one day we'll no longer be able to enjoy body rapping. OTOH who knows what his next breakout bit will be... it's only certain he'll keep trying them."
Earwolf,33z2jk,downwithlevers,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:00:09 2015 UTC,You need the wacky guy to go along with the straightman(or woman) that's why I gave up on game grumps for a while after jontron left. Dan wasn't half as silly as Jon was.
Earwolf,33z2jk,Slayner,3,Tue Apr 28 04:20:16 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%. I've been so hesitant to come down on Tig after everything she's been through, but stepping back from it, she's had nothing but incredible success since then and I keep getting an increasing sense of entitlement from her. And David, depending on the day, will either be in a thinly veiled funk or a nonentity.   Kyle, on the other hand, is one of the few ""celebrities"" I wish I was close friends with in person, he's just got that way of speaking that makes you start smiling before bursting into laughter. Not sure if you caught the two solo episodes he did at the beginning of the year but they were some of the best in recent memory. Tig choosing to just have Stephanie on and do the ""aren't we cute"" shtick for both of hers were telling of where she's at now. I didn't listen to David's."
Earwolf,33z2jk,pumpkinoatmeal,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:25:38 2015 UTC,"I forgot about those solo bolo episodes, but they are great examples. Like you, I was extremely turned off by Tig's ep with Stephanie - for both! - and couldn't make it through more than a few minutes of the first.  David tried hard in his solo ep, but I found it clumsy and boring and couldn't make it past where he started doing a ""satire"" of Serial iirc. And on regular episodes he's not as petulant as he was in like 2013 but he's still the pill in the overall group.  Kyle's episodes were really strong, having Mother on to do a Mother Meditation might have been a bit much but he really carried the episodes and presented a strong overall product. I really look forward to seeing his star rise and hopefully we'll be able to enjoy him in a lot of content (ala T.J. Miller) in a few years."

Earwolf,33z2jk,MadMan2012,10,Wed Apr 29 01:55:02 2015 UTC,"To me, my unpopular Earwolf opinion is the exact opposite. I genuinely love Wompler and I feel like everyone isn't into her whole universe at all. I know people find the constant rehashing of her and List's backstory annoying but no matter how many times I hear it, it still delights me to no end.   I enjoyed and first Womp It Up and am excited about the guest diversity it, Spontaneanaljadkjhkfahsl, and a bunch of other Earwolf shows, old and new, seem to be bringing in lately. I LOVE all the regulars but when hosts bring in their wider network of comedians who are less familiar to me, like the Thrilling Adventure people or Thomas Middleditch on CBB a few weeks ago, it just makes me so happy."
Earwolf,33z2jk,goofy_ball,4,Mon Apr 27 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on not being the hugest fan of the character as others, mainly because the meat of her story arc occurred before I got into CBB, but I am fairly recent a St. Clair convert; I think she's fucking great.  She was particularly funny as Andy Daly's wife on Review, and also knocked it out of the park on a recent ep of the CBB TV show, not to mention Playing House.  Super excited to listen to the podcast."
Earwolf,33z2jk,requisite_monocle,4,Mon Apr 27 01:20:12 2015 UTC,"I thought Wompler's first three appearances were so good, but then the continuation of the character made me like her less and less."
Earwolf,33z2jk,ElectricMarmalade,3,Mon Apr 27 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"yea, now it seems like every third joke needs to be explained to someone else in the studio so it makes sense and can be rolled with. I think the Wompler continuity is more complex than all of Andy Daly's continuity."

I'm actually hoping having the Wompler podcast will help St. Clair and Parham (both amazing people) figure out how to just BE these characters again.  Otherwise, keeping track of people is going to be twice as the Tale of Genji!"

Earwolf,33z2jk,pdxsean,26,Mon Apr 27 14:09:12 2015 UTC,"Comedy Bang Bang is probably the most inconsistent podcast I listen to. That isn't to say it isn't close to my heart (it is), but I'd say that week-to-week I can easily rely on the average HH or I4H episode for more laughs than the average CBB. There are far more peaks and valleys to it.   This isn't really a complaint, just kind of an acknowledgement that something that I listen to so consistently varies wildly from week-to-week (I think this is particularly stark, now in which we where given two weeks of three really sub-par episodes after a pretty strong run). Again though, we are talking about free professional-level improvisational comedy, so that is why I am airing this opinion here."
Earwolf,33z2jk,MeanLatifah,9,Thu Apr 30 08:04:16 2015 UTC,"I agree.  CBB is definitely guest dependent whereas HH is not.  When the guests are good though, CBB can be non-stop hilarity."
Earwolf,33z2jk,weaglebeagle,4,Mon Apr 27 03:49:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I'd say my favorite episodes of CBB outrank my favorite episodes of HH (even though Skellington's Kiss is pretty high up there), but even the worse HH is worth a chuckle or two, whereas the worse CBB can leave me actually pretty irritated."
Earwolf,33z2jk,requisite_monocle,9,Mon Apr 27 12:51:57 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to CBB for a long time, I think I started in the teens or twentys, and I agree. When it was CDR it was super consistent, home-run style. The second hundred episodes were still really great, with a few down notes. I feel like the last year or so it's really been hit-or-miss.   It does seem to correlate with CBB TV. Obviously Scott doesn't have the time or drive to put into the podcast that he used to. Add to that, he is bringing in a lot of new guests we don't already love - people he's met because of his show, or who are cross-appearing (like Tom Green) on both media.  I know Scott loves his content and the TV show remains top-notch but the podcast has dropped from easily #1 to barely top-five in my rankings... and I feel like it's only nostalgia keeping it there."
Earwolf,33z2jk,tkdgns,8,Mon Apr 27 02:31:23 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more. The drop off seemed to happen when Scott stopped doing the live show and started the tv show. So instead of having all these great comedians on who would appear on the live show. Now it's a lot of actors, musicians, and other random people Scott has met working on the tv show."
Earwolf,33z2jk,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Mon Apr 27 03:23:52 2015 UTC,I never considered that but I think you're exactly right. All of the classic guests were pretty much people in that LA comedy scene that would have frequented the CDR show.
Earwolf,33z2jk,ShockinglyEfficient,6,Mon Apr 27 03:43:37 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it is insane that we get CBB on a weekly basis! Choctaw has to work so much! That's why I didn't want to make it sound like a complaint, it's crazy how much content he is producing, and some of it really is gold (the recent Abelson episode is going to be hard to beat for number 1 this year IMO), but it also really weird that something I consume on a week-to-week basis is so unreliable."

Earwolf,33z2jk,DanzigMeowMeow,5,Mon Apr 27 09:25:24 2015 UTC,"Blaine is so funny, but his DM work is definitely unfocused. I still enjoy listening though."
Earwolf,33z2jk,MadMan2012,2,Tue Apr 28 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"I think his DMing just seems more unfocused compared to Sark. Sark was trying to build a story/journey for the group. that's why when they started they were all in the same trouble and had a defined immediate enemy with clear goals. With Blaine it seems like his style of DMing is about him reacting to player freedom. They started out without any trouble going on and then started it, I would say Sarah started it by attempting flirt-stealing from people in the tavern. From there he has been providing them a world to interact with instead of reacting to the next set piece of prepared story. I have really started to appreciate the freedom he is giving the group."
Earwolf,33z2jk,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Mon Apr 27 13:38:12 2015 UTC,Oh I like it! But I can get why someone wouldn't. A lot of episodes don't end up covering a lot of ground.
Earwolf,33z2jk,Steapenhyll,2,Tue Apr 28 15:24:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I kind of prefer Sark's approach to plot so far but still it's in my podcast rotation
Earwolf,33z2jk,TheBlackSpank,2,Mon Apr 27 13:09:34 2015 UTC,"I do too, but I love Blaine and I do like him as a DM. But Sark was way more into story crafting then making jokes, which made it a bit more necessary to pay closer attention."

Earwolf,33z2jk,spinney,2,Tue Apr 28 01:05:26 2015 UTC,Wow. It was brave of you to admit that
Earwolf,33z2jk,requisite_monocle,9,Wed Apr 29 13:27:28 2015 UTC,"I think Hollywood Handbook might be the best thing on Earwolf. I wasn't sold at first, but after listening to more episodes, I fucking love that show, and it's like the least popular podcast on there."
Earwolf,33z2jk,WhosCountin,4,Wed Apr 29 14:29:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's taken over as my favorite Earwolf podcast. I can see why it's not the most accessible for some but it is constantly brilliant from week to week.
Earwolf,33z2jk,spinney,17,Mon Apr 27 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"First off remember the real unpopular opinions in threads like these get downvoted so check near the bottom.  Anyway I'll go. Barring Lapkus, whom I adore, I don't find the other wild horses members very funny. Their characters do nothing for me and in the end are almost entirely forgettable (I can't remember one character they've done actually)  I feel like they've been getting lots of appearances lately but I rarely get through episodes they appear in."
Earwolf,33z2jk,requisite_monocle,10,Mon Apr 27 17:12:42 2015 UTC,"I actually think they each have their own strengths. Lapkus is by far the best character improviser of the bunch, but I think that Mary Holland and Stephanie Allyne both outclass her in more ""standard improv"" (Holland's most recent HH episode and both Holland's and Allyne's I4H numerous eps are what make me think this). I feel like Whitehead has been the least exposed of the bunch, but from what I have gotten she is more in the middle ground. I like both her characters and her improvisation, and I feel like she does both, well.   Together though, I feel like they are an incredibly strong group that bounce off of each other EXTREMELY well (they have two I4H eps all together and that one WSGLL ep that I would check out, if you haven't already).  EDIT: To get specific, I feel like Lapkus relies on gross-out humor a little too much in ALL the improv that she does, but this translates better into characters than it does a scene (she doesn't do it all the time, but it does seem like a crutch)."
Earwolf,33z2jk,Numlocks,6,Mon Apr 27 18:03:43 2015 UTC,"Holland's most recent HH episode   This episode alone made me like Mary Holland twice as much. I always thought she was funny, but not that memorable. But Sean and Hayes really helped her figure out how to do comedy and set her career off in the right direction. They really are so funny, and so nice."
Earwolf,33z2jk,nohorseman,3,Mon Apr 27 13:52:02 2015 UTC,"This is why I love threads like these, counter points that make me reevaluate some things with a new perspective. I actually don't think I've heard them on I4H so I'll have to check them out."
Earwolf,33z2jk,downwithlevers,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:16:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely wasn't trying to discount your point! I feel like the other three have not had the best appearances on CBB, but I am glad that I brought the I4H episodes to your attention. For me, seeing Allyne on I4H is almost equal to seeing Lapkus on a CBB (like I said Whitehead doesn't have that many separate from the group, and Holland has only a couple more)."
Earwolf,33z2jk,oshoney,3,Tue Apr 28 14:07:07 2015 UTC,Stephanie Allyne is always great on I4H. Mary Holland is pretty good on I4H only. I dont think Erin Whitehead is that funny at all.
Earwolf,33z2jk,WhosCountin,2,Mon Apr 27 02:48:51 2015 UTC,Mary Holland's HH may be my favorite ep of all time

Earwolf,33z2jk,AnkleFarm,6,Mon Apr 27 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"It has some good moments but I just find the improv style so fucking tiring sometimes. The entire show is kind of like the weakest parts of UTU2TM, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I feel like they force a lot of bits and it just slows things down and my mind can't help but wander.   I like how on Scott's shows there's always a mix of improv and sincerity throughout an episode. Switches up pace and keeps things interesting. HH just gets exhausting to listen to."

At first I was digging it, but by about episode three I had had enough. I can tell both of them are funny and smart, and I do find moments of their show banter to be funny. But it just draws on way too long. As someone else said, it kinda sounds like a watered down version of what the Scotts would do on UTU2TM."
Earwolf,33z2jk,Kurisonu,9,Mon Apr 27 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"I find Howard Kremer more annoying than funny these days. It really disappoints me as I used to really like him. Now I'm left wondering if he changed, or if I did."
Earwolf,33z2jk,vagued,9,Mon Apr 27 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"I've been so annoyed with Howard some weeks, that I've almost quit listening. Sometimes he's so narcissistic, I can't deal with it.  (I also find his taste in music dreadful.) I know it's part of his style, doing his own thing, but when he's literally interrupting or talking over other people or not paying attention because it's not about him, it bums me out.  And I guess Ku's okay with it, but his Asian and/or sexual jokes about her really bother me sometimes.  I still love Ku and Stard and, yes, Howard. But one of these days, I may need a break.  EDIT: Added just a little extra detail."

Maybe not being from the USA I don't get it, but it seems a bit inflammatory and up its own ass. Shit stirring for shit stirrings sake."
Earwolf,33z2jk,versusgorilla,5,Mon Apr 27 10:10:33 2015 UTC,"I like it sometimes, and appreciate it overall, but when he openly says, ""I'm ignorant about this, but I'm going to express a steadfast opinion about it anyway,"" it seriously is like, ""Do you realize you've become one of those liberals they say are just as bad as Fox News?"""
Earwolf,33z2jk,Lukepatrick88,11,Tue Apr 28 06:19:17 2015 UTC,"Plus, Andrew Ti won't let Sean and Hayes sit at his table in the Earwolf Cafeteria!"
Earwolf,33z2jk,versusgorilla,4,Mon Apr 27 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"The show has a good concept, a lot of people have this idea that racism is only explicit hate crimes, and it's important to talk about everyday racism and its deep entrenchment in a lot of aspects of life. I like the idea of doing that in a conversational way that's not overly aggressive. It's not inflammatory to bring up everyday racism and point it out where it happens, it's the racism that's inflammatory.  However, the lack of research on that show completely undermines the point a lot of the times. The question will be about an important or complex issue that Andrew/guest won't fully understand because they can't possibly know everything about everything, and as a result they just give really generic, uninformed answers. I like listening to it sometimes because it's easy to follow and it's only ~15 minutes, but more often than not I'm just left annoyed."
Earwolf,33z2jk,pbbatenatar,3,Mon Apr 27 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. It has a good concept, but too many times a question is asked and the answer is ""I don't know anything about ____""  Maybe don't make it a totally unplanned discussion. Listen to the question, do like fifteen minutes of research, then replay the question while recording and discuss."
Earwolf,33z2jk,MeanLatifah,3,Mon Apr 27 23:48:30 2015 UTC,I don't like it because they never seem to give anyone the benifit of the doubt. If Andrew turned on a caller once a week or once every 10 days who was genuinely an asshole I'd be fine with it but it seems each time he tries to call the caller themselves racist when most of the time they seem just a little confused and hamfisted
Earwolf,33z2jk,barrist,3,Mon Apr 27 04:53:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I mean about them doing like an ounce of research before a show.  Today I listened to the new episode where a caller referenced Ben Affleck's recent issue with trying to hide the fact that his ancestors owned slaves.  An issue I'd like to hear them talk about, but neither he or his guest had heard about it.  You host a goddamn racism show where you talk racism questions and that was an actual issue from the week about racism.  Instead, since they had heard nothing about this, they called the caller a racist and yammered on about basically nothing.  Do some goddamn research."

Earwolf,33z2jk,ThinkinWithSand,8,Wed May 6 00:53:31 2015 UTC,I was underwhelmed by the Calvins Twins episode.  I did not enjoy the Solo Bolo.  I don't think Claudia O'Doherty is funny.  The mnemonic device gag in the Time Bobby episodes was amusing the first time. It was tedious every other time.  I don't like the Suicide House episodes.

People feel some need to point out that she doesn't ""deserve"" it. Which is frankly bullshit.   She plays her role on Who Charted perfectly. She's funny but she knows she's not an out and out comedian so plays the foil to Howard's insanity by smartly pausing on something Howard said or making him explain himself that ends up bringing out even more funny moments."

Its' just so easy to listen to and enjoy. Someone mentioned the inconsistency of CBB, which I can relate to. Its' for this reason I often find myself uninterested in checking out episodes that might later turn out to be legendary. Basically, I feel like many of my favorite shows have a lot riding on them before I even download them, whereas WC doesn't. For instance, I love Greg Proops but he can be such a pill that I feel like I have to gear up for his show sometimes.   WC just hits the spot. Its' like going to lunch with your buddies. At worst you'll have a fun meal and catch up, but there's a good possibility you might fall out laughing at some point.

I think I (maybe you) like CBB because of Scott Aukerman's humour and the way he interacts with people, so the characters just derail that, which explains why I like Analyze Phizh and UTU2TM so much, and why the Solo Bolo is my favourite episode."

It was amazing, I'll edit this in just a second so I can add the link. If you haven't heard it it's so good.   EDIT: Okay here we go, this is the episode. It's a bonus episode where Matt goes on a LONG rant about people needing to support good shit (one of his best rants, and one I agree with) but there's a fantastic scene they do that starts at 20:15.

But what I really love most about his comedy is the over the top insincerity, where he'll say something really obvious but act like it's this huge controversial tellin'-it-like-it-is truth bomb. Basically, the entire premise behind New-No-No's, which kill me. Plus he was great as the acting coach on CBBTV.  Also I find his high nerd vocals really endearing. I listen to a Don't Stop or We'll Die song at least once a week."

Maybe Rashida Jones is with them?  Asssscat is okay now but it's hard to live up to back then when there were so many all-stars on stage.
Earwolf,33tpuu,ghosthustler,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:11:44 2015 UTC,I think it's the one in LA because I didn't see the bar in the back like they have at the NY one.
Earwolf,33tpuu,oshoney,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:45:52 2015 UTC,"If you go to the assscats in LA it's still pretty star-studded, at least if you're into Earwolf. Besser, Lapkus, Wengert, Woods, Roberts, Walsh sometimes, Daly sometimes, Morris, etc."
Earwolf,33tpuu,555nick,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'm here on the west side and ASSSSCAT's kinda hit & miss now, IMO. Zach Woods is great when he's there but that's about it. Miss Zooks & Poehler, Sanz and Jack McBrayer, but glad for their Hollywood success. I think (and have heard Besser say) improv sorta peaked,  that sketch is on it's way up. Seems to be cyclical with people pioneering then sycophant followers, then pioneers killing their former improv gods, etc.  Super jealous to see all the people you listed!"
Earwolf,33tpuu,Antonton,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"Jack MacBreyer still does Facebook on Wednesdays pretty regularly.   Honestly, I feel like ASSSSCAT's quality is far more dependent on the monologist than on the players. The players are always good, if not great, but I've seen a few shows where the monologist just doesn't give them good stories to work with or just completely sucks the air out of the room."

Earwolf,33tgv7,nicemaker,2,Sun Apr 26 07:15:52 2015 UTC,"It's quite a mix of people actually; British, American, Indian, Argentinian, Canadian, then a couple of locals. (I'm the British one)     Most of the Comedy I've seen here is British or American (sometimes Aussies) comedian's flown in for big events.  There's a club that brings people in once a month, we get the British 'Who's Line' guys once a year through that club. We also had Russell Peters recently and Bill Burr who were both amazing.   There's a full time comedy club with events most nights but I rarely make it there.  The comedy is pretty similar there, there's a lot of location based jokes which makes sense.  They actually do events in Cantonese which I have no way of understanding, but I'm led to believe the  humour there is different"

Either way congrats! It's something I could never do, so seriously major props to those who can."
Earwolf,33tgv7,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Sun Apr 26 13:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can!    The big thing that pushed me towards doing it was listening to a Sean Clements interview someone posted.  He said that he was always thinking about doing stand up, and he didn't do it because that's not how he was funny.  Then he saw improv and realised that was a good format for him.   That being said I'm not in it to try and get laughs (I will get laughs, but that's not why I'm there).  The main reason I'm doing it is to think about how I react to people, am I really listening and responding properly.  There have been times where I've gone into a meeting/interaction and had a plan of how I wanted to get my point across.  They then said something which would have let me change my approach to get my point across better.  Often I don't notice those queues until after the fact and ploughed on with my original approach which I should've changed based on what I heard.   So, go do it for fun, or to improve yourself, or any other reason you can think of  written by the guy who has taken one improv class"

Earwolf,33t4ut,CakeBoss16,11,Sat Apr 25 10:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'd pay a subscription fee for videos of I4H, CBB, and Hollywood Handbook. The VPN stuff was great."
Earwolf,33t4ut,TheBlackSpank,11,Sat Apr 25 11:58:05 2015 UTC,I'd pay $10 a month to never hear Paul Scheer read another ad into his iPhone as he walks down the street.
Earwolf,33t4ut,dronesoverbrklyn,3,Sat Apr 25 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"I don't like to even think about it.  I buy merch, I go to live shows, I've bought some of the live tour downloads... but yea, I don't know what would happen if Earwolf turned to a pay model.  I think it's pretty clear that a pure pay model isn't the most profitable model for the podcasters anyway.  For example, Jimmy Pardo joined Earwolf and switched from a model where very little was free to a model where he offers a lot more for free and has bonus episodes for paid subscribers.  I'm guessing he did that based on the financial realities of the decision - ability to make more money from advertisers, draw in more listeners (who are then willing to pay for bonus content), etc."
Earwolf,33t4ut,newprofile15,5,Sat Apr 25 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I would. I already bought the pro version of HH, so I don't have much money left now."
Earwolf,33t4ut,FriVault,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:55:18 2015 UTC,There's a pro version of Huell Howser?
Earwolf,33t4ut,Jackie_Jormp-Jomp,2,Tue Apr 28 02:43:14 2015 UTC,"I've thought about it before and I still don't know. For starters it would have to include the paid live episodes. Second, I think it would have to be like WTF, where the x latest episodes are free. If everything costs then they're not going to get many new listeners and they'll probably lose a lot of listeners too.  As for cost I have no idea. If the latest episodes are still free I wouldn't personally see the point, which I think is why it's such a difficult issue."
Earwolf,33t4ut,LostMyPotato,3,Sat Apr 25 11:11:12 2015 UTC,"Well I believe the the live shows would be a good idea. And defiantly ad free but the weird thing is some cbb, Hollywood handbook, etc ads are quite funny. I couldn't imagine they would make you pay for the weekly episodes."
Earwolf,33t4ut,shabby47,3,Sat Apr 25 11:27:08 2015 UTC,"I actually find myself not skipping a lot of the ads now. Especially with shows like CBB, Hollywood handbook and NNF because they are often just as funny as the show.  Other podcasts I hit the 15 sec skip as fast as I can when they start talking about blue apron or legal zoom because I know it will be straight from a script.   The worst (for the sponsors) has got to be joe rogan. He just reads 6 minutes of scripts for crap at the beginning of the show to get it all out of the way at once. I doubt anybody familiar with the show actually listens to those more than once before they realize they can just skip past all of them at once.   I used to fill out those surveys that were being promoted on a lot of the shows a year ago about the products advertised and tell them to incorporate the ads or make them interesting/funny so people don't skip right over them. I like to think they listened to me"
Earwolf,33t4ut,nohorseman,3,Sat Apr 25 14:11:39 2015 UTC,They include a little somethin for daddy
Earwolf,33t4ut,Slayner,5,Sat Apr 25 17:07:45 2015 UTC,Bring out the girls!
Earwolf,33t4ut,Slayner,2,Sat Apr 25 17:46:19 2015 UTC,I'm so deep in the hole of my addiction that my answer is yes.
Earwolf,33t4ut,Condawg,2,Sat Apr 25 12:58:51 2015 UTC,Well from your frequency on this sub that's quite apparent. But what would you like from the money you give?
Earwolf,33t4ut,Slayner,2,Sat Apr 25 13:01:19 2015 UTC,Well earwolf isn't too greedy so I highly doubt they'd ever ask this much but I could go up to like 20 bucks a month and be happy. I could even consider going up higher.   Like another user said if they brought back VPN I would absolutely be happy paying for a premium service
Earwolf,33t4ut,Condawg,3,Sat Apr 25 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"I'd also definitely pay a subscription if VPN came back, but I don't think I could justify $20 a month. Harmontown recently started a subscription service, $5/month for access to video episodes and some other perks. That's a no-brainer for me. The fact that they live-stream the episodes makes it an even better deal, though I don't watch the live-streams.  I imagine it'd cost a bit more for Earwolf since they'd be doing more than one show, but $20 is still a good bit outside of my ""no-brainer"" zone. $5-10/month and I'm there."
Earwolf,33t4ut,Slayner,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:59:50 2015 UTC,Oh I was just giving an example as how much I'd be willing to pay. If they ever did something like this I'd say you're right they'll only charge 5-10 but I'm so deep into my addiction I'd be willing to go as high as what I said.
Earwolf,33t4ut,Condawg,2,Sun Apr 26 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"I knew what you meant, I was just using your comment as a jumping board for mine, I guess. I could've just made a top-level comment, but your eyes drew me in.  I really hope they find a way to bring VPN back. I can only watch the episodes they have up so many times. That's not true, I'll keep watching them. Dammit."
Earwolf,33t4ut,DanzigMeowMeow,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:15:18 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I gotcha, Yeah I'd love it if they brought back VPN, they enhance all these aleady amazing episodes so much. I can't decide what I like more I4H, CBB, or Whooch. So good either way."

Earwolf,33rhdh,CakeBoss16,4,Sun Apr 26 16:21:24 2015 UTC,Awesome! I4h is such an easy podcast too get into due to format. You are bound too get some laughs. It's either legendary status like that episode or confusing but you still laugh.
Earwolf,33rhdh,DanzigMeowMeow,10,Sun Apr 26 16:26:51 2015 UTC,Haven't you heard about the Besser/HH feud?  just kidding but that would be a fun HH scenario
Earwolf,33rhdh,tight_butthole,12,Fri Apr 24 23:12:37 2015 UTC,He's probably a bit too small to get on that show.
Earwolf,33rhdh,Numlocks,5,Sat Apr 25 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah but Sean is a nice funny smart guy, and since Sean graced Matt with his presence on I4H I just figured maybe they'd allow it just this once.   An episode of how the student has become the master. Matt may have taught Sean the ucb arts but now Sean can teach Matt a thing or two."
Earwolf,33rhdh,flimflamslappy,5,Sat Apr 25 03:00:05 2015 UTC,Sean was on I4H back when HH just started. He's pretty great.

Earwolf,33rhdh,dave1338,2,Sat Apr 25 17:44:48 2015 UTC,"Here's a comment I made in another thread:   It's a very funny show where two guys are constantly in character as Hollywood blowhards, satirizing overly-self-important podcasts. That's the basic premise, anyway, but it's a lot more than that. It has rocketed into my top 2 shows ever since their appearance on WSGLL earlier this year.   A common experience is having difficulty getting into it, but then it suddenly ""clicks"" and you're head over heels with it. Kind of like how very continuity-heavy CBBs win the best ofs, people like feeling ""in."" On the surface it might just seem like a couple of guys messing up subject-verb agreement then laughing off mic at it, but it is actually very funny and very smart, and the show is funny smart cool guys being nice.   Check out this thread if you want to consider getting into it and you should!"
Earwolf,33rhdh,nohorseman,2,Sun Apr 26 18:28:54 2015 UTC,i give it a try. i will start with the Pft and aukerman episodes.

Earwolf,33rhdh,istartriots,2,Sun Apr 26 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"Try the recent Jon Gabrus ep. It kind of epitomises the show for me. Its super dry, dead pan comedy and as the comment above says, they never break character. It's just riff upon riff, very silly but incredibly funny."

Earwolf,33qu98,TheBlackSpank,4,Sat Apr 25 01:59:56 2015 UTC,The only problem I see with this is Bob ducca already has his own podcast.   Instead it should be flipped. Todd should be a guest on Affirmation Nation.
Earwolf,33qczf,jarluch,20,Fri Apr 24 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"Cost too much so they stopped. Scott said so in one of his ama's.   I wish they would just set up a cam in the room and record them anyway. Even if it's horrible quality, watching it adds so much more. When it's in my earbuds I never really feel like I can just sit down and listen to it, I always have to be doing something else or I feel like I'm wasting time.

Or maybe it's set up so as you pay more money you get access to a greater number of shows.  $5 a month for one show of your choice, $6 a month for two of your choice, that kinda thing.     I would probably get more out of that than my Netflix subscription.    And I still want my ""go pro strapped on the host's, and guest's head"" idea put to use at least once.  Hopefully on two charted."

They produce a few different podcasts (The RT Podcast, The Patch, and I think there's another one) which are all released on iTunes. But they also record a video version, which they livestream on their website. You can watch it live (and contribute via twitter) if you pay for a sponsorship. Then they release the video on YouTube a week later.  Earwolf could maybe do something like that."

Earwolf,33qeo4,newprofile15,3,Fri Apr 24 17:52:18 2015 UTC,Can't tell if you're being sarcastic...  If you get tired of repeated jokes easily I could imagine that many Earwolf podcasts would be torture.
Earwolf,33qeo4,newprofile15,2,Fri Apr 24 18:21:25 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest here, and get downvoted.  I don't like this joke, this is a sarcastic post, I know sarcasm is cheap comedy.   But I also think this is the only repeated joke, where the repetition is not the joke.  If you get that?  Scott has a lot of jokes that he'll repeat often, and that's the punchline.  Iiiiiiit's been and many, many more.  But this one joke seems to get slipped in very often, but it feels like whoever says it is honestly looking for a laugh based solely on the joke.   I don't know if this is making sense to anyone.   I thought Sean and Hayes would have picked up on this and made it into a bit on the pocast, but they haven't.   I would also have thought Harris would be one to call it out :(      I'm looking way to deep into a dumb joke."
Earwolf,33qeo4,Slayner,4,Fri Apr 24 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying I suppose.  I don't really think it's played purely for laughs though necessarily (at least, not all the time).  For example, it'll often be used as some kind of in-universe explanation... like some crazy character will be admitting to a crime on the podcast and they'll say ""we'll edit that out"" for the purpose of maintaining suspension of disbelief.  So there, it's relevant for the purpose of the character and not necessarily played for laughs.  Either that or it'll be used in a self-effacing way when someone's joke falls completely flat.  It's a throwaway bit... but honestly I feel like that is a lot of Earwolf bits (and podcast bits, and comedy bits in general).  I mean look at the flairs for this sub - it's nothing but catchphrases!  Sometimes the hosts get as tired of them as we do... maybe even earlier.  For me I feel like the catchphrases don't have to be the most brilliant comedy on their own, they're more like triggers that remind me of all the laughs I've gotten from Earwolf."

Especially if he keeps flirting with dramatic roles like this.  And I think you all know what that means. A little contract he signed that he would declare his intent shove the award into his anus in front of the ""academy show crowd upon his win"". And we all know Adam Scott is a man that does not welch on deals."

He was good last time because of Jimmy's interaction with his mom, but I'm still so bitter about his Whooch appearance and his vine comedy in general."
Earwolf,33lg91,nohorseman,4,Thu Apr 23 14:39:20 2015 UTC,Yeah clearly they're saving the better guests for the Player's Club... Wasn't Kulap on recently too? I'm not a member but I've been heavily considering signing up the last few weeks. I'm concerned about accessibility though. I only listen to podcasts offline in my car or at work so I've been wondering how they're normally made available if not through iTunes or whatever.
Earwolf,33lg91,dihsho,4,Thu Apr 23 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"You can easily put the feed into iTunes and podcast apps. You click a button on the website, it opens up itunes and prompts you to sign in with your NNF account. You have to do it for every season but it is very simple and easy."
Earwolf,33lg91,nohorseman,4,Thu Apr 23 15:12:48 2015 UTC,"My podcast app (which I imagine similar things exist in iOS also) allows for setting up an advanced feed for a password protected RSS feed. They give you the RSS link and you put in the username and password. Then the app automatically downloads the newest ep when it's released and is waiting for me when I wake up on Mondays and Thursdays. I never watch the video but I guess it's there on the site, too. I just like the extra show."
Earwolf,33lg91,nohorseman,2,Thu Apr 23 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Uncertainty about how it would work for the extra show was holding me back. Yeah I don't have much interest in the video feed (outside of maybe like a specific gag) but I would like the extra podcast and hey, they would be entertaining me for 4 hours a week, seems reasonable to compensate them for it."

Earwolf,33lg91,dontlookinhere,6,Thu Apr 23 15:22:15 2015 UTC,"It seems like they're using the players club episodes for fan favourites, and first timers (or people with more reach) are normally getting on the main episode.   Makes some sense as they'll attract more listeners (from outside the NNF/Earwolf family) for the free eps, then the people who want the favourites will pay  This season has been such high quality across free and pay eps, really worth getting on board now"
Earwolf,33lg91,nohorseman,2,Fri Apr 24 06:35:37 2015 UTC,"I never heard or don't remember him on Whooch, was he a bad guest?  I havent seen his vine stuff either, but from just hearing him on this and on sklarbro once (i think) he seemed fine."
Earwolf,33lg91,ThinkinWithSand,6,Thu Apr 23 18:11:04 2015 UTC,"He just does low level youtube/vine humor (""women be like ____"") that I'm admitting I'm not the target audience for, but isn't very artful.   On Whooch he was weirdly antagonistic and was attempting to psychoanalyze and fix Howard. KuWie discussed it being very awkward in the following Twooch  EDIT: bet you can't last more than 2 minutes in this video. I guess Vine isn't a great medium for comedy but low level humor combined with casual racism, misogyny, homophobia THEN yelling at the sultan of summah!? I don't THINK so"
Earwolf,33lg91,prembrant,3,Thu Apr 23 18:18:39 2015 UTC,Just once on Sklarbro? Maybe you just mean as himself because he's on it all the time as Bryant Gumbel and Bruce Jenner.
Earwolf,33lg91,bkbro,5,Fri Apr 24 14:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not a member and I just deleted the last few free eps without listening.

Earwolf,33kq86,spinney,13,Thu Apr 23 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah he wasn't bad. Not always hilarious, but the conversation flowed and he was pretty game with the comic business in the second half. Plus, how could the episode be bad with Scott's Liam Neeson impression?"
Earwolf,33kq86,JasmineForsythe,12,Thu Apr 23 14:49:55 2015 UTC,I don't really understand how Kevin Pollak is so hated. He's so muted and calm. His chat show is really great when there's a good guest because he lets the guest talk as long as they need to. I really don't get any pompousness from him.
Earwolf,33kq86,Ed_Sullivision,4,Thu Apr 23 19:57:47 2015 UTC,His conversations on his chat show are amazing and Samm the Ma'am Levine aka Lil' Wolverine is fun on it too.

Earwolf,33kq86,CrouchJr,15,Thu Apr 23 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"This is true. I couldn't stand him for the longest time in spite of my buddy's insistence that he was exceptionally funny. His laugh in particular felt very sycophantic. Then I listened to his standup, and gradually got into his show by listening to episodes with guests I liked, and really came to love his sincerity and humor. He has some dumb opinions but his unabashed enthusiasm and honesty is very infectious."
Earwolf,33kq86,JasmineForsythe,9,Thu Apr 23 16:21:37 2015 UTC,I like his standup but he can be a pretty overwhelming podcast guest.

Earwolf,33kq86,CrouchJr,8,Thu Apr 23 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"He is the biggest dichotomy for me between not liking him as a person very much to finding him exceptionally funny. His appearance on Hound Tall, DLM (sometimes, especially recently with DC Pierson), and many YMIWs are primo pcasting"

Earwolf,33kq86,CrouchJr,8,Thu Apr 23 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"Oh! I didn't word it well. I think he's often a bit annoying and his new-agey California pseudoscience propensity frustrates me.

Earwolf,33kq86,nohorseman,8,Thu Apr 23 18:20:32 2015 UTC,"Ohhh k ya I get that.  I agree with you, I don't like hearing him talk about food especially.  But overall, C+ guy."

Earwolf,33kq86,thejjar,13,Thu Apr 23 14:01:30 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't Scott, who has long admired Paul Reubens and worked with Andy Dick, be aware of both of their histories?"
Earwolf,33kq86,goofy_ball,3,Fri Apr 24 03:09:18 2015 UTC,"My first thought was maybe JP Manoux who was busted a few months back on voyeurism charges (google what he done did, ew what a creep!) I knew he was on some Earwolf podcasts and Doug Loves Movies in the past, but now that I checked, I guess he was never on CBB."
Earwolf,33kq86,bophem,12,Fri Apr 24 02:02:36 2015 UTC,"Throughout this episode, it seemed like Scott was constantly trying to start episodes of ""I Love Films""."
Earwolf,33kq86,Drew_Eckse,10,Thu Apr 23 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"I love it whenever Scott mentions the Murphy group.  On another note, this documentary seems like an interesting concept, has anyone seen it? What did you think? I'm about to rent it tonight..."
Earwolf,33kq86,Pluppets,8,Thu Apr 23 16:58:36 2015 UTC,Tuna: It's clunky in a can and it stinks in a sandwich!
Earwolf,33kq86,AttemptedBirdhouse1,7,Thu Apr 23 17:07:36 2015 UTC,One of my favorite subcategories of Seth Morris characters is characters who are foley artists.
Earwolf,33kq86,tkdgns,8,Thu Apr 23 23:56:10 2015 UTC,"Kevin: ""I don't judge penises   Scott: quietly ""I'm judge, jury, and executioner of penises!""  The greatest line"
Earwolf,33kq86,DrBearPHD,5,Sat Apr 25 00:03:01 2015 UTC,I'm disappointed they didn't play Which Would You Rather.

Earwolf,33kq86,dnmty,3,Fri Apr 24 15:14:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm crazy, but didn't we already have this foley artist character a few months back?"
Earwolf,33kq86,StickerBrush,7,Fri Apr 24 19:31:20 2015 UTC,This was so much better than Monday's
Earwolf,33kq86,Ailite,2,Thu Apr 23 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, the first half hour seemed like a long commercial to me :/"
Earwolf,33kq86,potatohead3,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"Man, Seth Morris needs to take some of Horatio Sanz' improv classes. Quite a few times he dropped a ""no, but"" that totally threw off the jokes."
Earwolf,33kq86,Mr_Viper,2,Sat Apr 25 08:49:40 2015 UTC,"First Tom Green, now Kevin Pollack. No thanks."
Earwolf,33kq86,tenderboats,9,Thu Apr 23 10:58:23 2015 UTC,"Mary Holland and Erin Whitehead made up for Tom Green. I haven't listened to this episode yet, but I can't imagine this episode could be bad with Nick Kroll and Seth Morris. I don't like Kevin Pollak, either, but you've got two hilarious regulars on at the same time. It should still be a C+."
Earwolf,33kq86,TheBlackSpank,11,Thu Apr 23 12:12:45 2015 UTC,"Listening now it great so far. To me Kevin pollack is like a toned down jimmy pardo. He can be a little touch for me, so Kevin is just the perfect amount speed talker I need."
Earwolf,33kq86,stenchwinslow,5,Thu Apr 23 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't complain, I got my Seth Morris fix on the amazing 4:20 I4H lineup this week."

Earwolf,33kq86,stenchwinslow,0,Sun Apr 26 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"I am so deeply torn...can two much loved guests make up for Pollacks pompous, rambling, ass."
Earwolf,33kq86,thelostdolphin,7,Thu Apr 23 10:49:05 2015 UTC,I think you're confusing a dry sense of humor with pomposity...
Earwolf,33kq86,stenchwinslow,0,Fri Apr 24 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"I find his persona off putting and boring, I can live with either but both leave me cold. I won't argue his talent or worth as person, he seems like an o.k. guy and I actually enjoy his dramatic acting, but his comedy stuff just doesn't vibe with me."
Earwolf,33kq86,thelostdolphin,7,Fri Apr 24 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"He's just an old school Jewish comedian with a dry sense of humor and different style of comedy from the alt/meta-humor of Earwolf. You don't have to like it, but declaring him to be a pompous, rambling ass is not the same as saying his comedy isn't for you, which was what I was responding to. Scott wouldn't have negotiated for him to come on board with Earwolf and Kevin wouldn't be able to get some of the absolute greatest actors, comedians, writers, etc currently working on his chat show and in his documentary if he was all those things."
Earwolf,33kq86,GilliMarshall,2,Fri Apr 24 01:40:37 2015 UTC,At least in a podcast I can't see his fedora
Earwolf,33kq86,traunks,-1,Thu Apr 23 13:50:34 2015 UTC,"The way Scott cut off Nick's call and said he was being boring seemed kind of dickish to me. He wasn't being boring and I would've liked to hear more from him. I love Scott but every once in a while he does something like this where he'll just turn on someone in a way that seems a little uncalled for. I get that Nick asked Scott for a favor to call in to promote his thing, but still Nick was being funny! Plus he's responsible for so much great CBB content that he should have license to call in whenever he wants!  So Scott, if you're reading this, LIEB HIM ALONE!"
Earwolf,33kq86,thelostdolphin,16,Thu Apr 23 19:51:38 2015 UTC,It's two friends giving each other shit. Nick thought it was funny. I think the humor of it just went completely over your head.
Earwolf,33kq86,traunks,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"I know he was somewhat ""ribbing him"" since he wouldn't have said that to him if they weren't friends, but he was also serious about the call being boring. I mean he rushed him off the damn phone!"
Earwolf,33kq86,thelostdolphin,12,Fri Apr 24 02:06:54 2015 UTC,It seriously went over your head.   Nick is walking down the street doing a quick pitch on the podcast before probably heading to do a million other promotional things and whatever else is going on and Scott played with the fact that they were only planning on talking a few brief minutes by busting his balls and ending things abruptly.   I promise you that you just misinterpreted what was going on.
Earwolf,33kq86,WeirderScott,6,Fri Apr 24 02:13:03 2015 UTC,Sometimes it's hard to make the best decisions in the heat of the moment while hosting the show.

Earwolf,33kq86,avoidtheshitosphere,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:57:07 2015 UTC,Nick was 1000% more entertaining than Seth's character.
Earwolf,33kq86,CakeBoss16,0,Sat Apr 25 15:14:00 2015 UTC,Well look like the grepesodes have ended their streak this week. Hopefully next week will get better.   Edit: okay Seth Morris saved it. But I was not a fan of such a long promotion. Kinda goes against the whole cbb philosophy for promoting.
Earwolf,33kqet,JasonGrayson,9,Thu Apr 23 08:51:31 2015 UTC,"they really need to just release the whole script reading at once, even if the show comes out less often"
Earwolf,33kqet,jononyx,5,Thu Apr 23 20:50:51 2015 UTC,"I'm really loving this show both in concept and execution, but can they please consider only putting ads at either the beginning or end of the episodes? It really disrupts the flow of the reading, especially when the script is already broken up into multiple episodes. Just a nit pick...."
Earwolf,33kqet,PDCchewie88,5,Fri Apr 24 02:35:52 2015 UTC,Does Franklin Leonard really have to have a losenge or whatever in his mouth while he's talking?! Am I the only one that notices that? haha

Earwolf,33kqet,dcfc821,4,Thu Apr 23 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm, idk if I'll be able to stick with this one. I love the cast and the idea is cool but this particular script seems more sophomoric than I'm willing to deal with...and I laugh at really dumb things."
Earwolf,33kqet,TvsPhil,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:32:24 2015 UTC,"It's tough to tell without having heard the whole thing, but I get the feeling the sophomoric humor is kind of the point. They talked about it in the filmmaker's interview a bit."
Earwolf,33kqet,bkbro,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:07:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I considered that but at the same time as a joke by joke experience, it feels like the overall meaning or point gets lost under the jokes. I don't know if that makes sense, but basically put, even if that is the point, I can't get past a lot of the jokes to enjoy the point they're making.  I'm not offended or anything. Just not my thing.  It may go over better for me as a short film or series."
Earwolf,33kqet,TvsPhil,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:20:08 2015 UTC,"Hey, if you don't think it's funny, you don't think it's funny. Comedies should be funny, no matter what point they're making."
Earwolf,33kqet,bkbro,3,Sat Apr 25 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"This script is basically Office Space meets Crank and I'm loving it. Scheer, Mantoukas, and Lapkus doing the reading makes it all the better.    Great new podcast. It's definitely worked its way into my weekly rotation."
Earwolf,33kqet,NotAGoodPoster,4,Thu Apr 23 22:22:54 2015 UTC,This Black List podcast is such a cool idea. Have they finished the script yet? I want to binge listen to the full performance.
Earwolf,33kqet,mi-16evil,4,Thu Apr 23 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"This is the move! I've listened to the first two and am switching the ol' approach, I'm a bit frustrated by listening to a movie in 4 chunks a week apart.   Also lots of weird ""retard"" (the script's word, not mine) humor today that made me uncomfortable."
Earwolf,33kqet,nohorseman,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:13:39 2015 UTC,No. It's on episode two and it's only about an hour into the read. I just listened and it's really funny. Looking forward to next weeks.

Earwolf,33ivij,angelfromthecoast,5,Thu Apr 23 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"True, but just know that Harris contributed to the premise and probably gave Aziz a ton of hilarious ideas. It's almost like we'll be getting new Harris material."

Earwolf,33ivij,nohorseman,3,Thu Apr 23 02:02:03 2015 UTC,"Aziz's most recent special was low on jokes, but he got me back into comedy. I had stuff I loved in middle school and high school I was obsessed with, then quit paying much attention in undergrad. Then Aziz which led me to podcasts. The moment I heard him talk about how much Jay Z hates the movie E. T. the Extraterrestrial and His Adventures on Earth did it for me"
Earwolf,33ivij,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,3,Thu Apr 23 03:18:48 2015 UTC,Weird. I like some of his previous stand up but this newest one I found myself audibly booing at my screen eight minutes in and shutting it off.
Earwolf,33ivij,nohorseman,2,Thu Apr 23 06:46:07 2015 UTC,"I think this was the first time the ""special a year"" so many comedians gun for got Aziz. He was working on that academic book, and all his sociology stuff leaked into the special with less effort toward jokes. I think he'll come around, but he's so big now he could go a number of directions. Hopefully further away from the Kevin Hart end of the spectrum (joke writers, lowest common denominator jokes).   He at least hasn't been hurt by the policy as bad as Doug Benson.   I caught this show while he was working on it and the crowd work stuff worked pretty well when you're in the room, but it wasn't as fun as his third special's low key engagement story crowd work."

Second Season coming soon, so a good time to catch up  Parks and Rec probably has the most Earwolf guest of any show (outside CBB TV), and its great (as Adam liked to point out) until the final season.

Earwolf,33gxb5,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Wed Apr 22 16:40:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing this grepisode of something I had no idea existed!
Earwolf,33gxb5,Ailite,4,Wed Apr 22 13:19:58 2015 UTC,Holy shit this is funny
Earwolf,33gxb5,nohorseman,4,Wed Apr 22 14:47:10 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to go on a rant here.. but isn't the ""I Don't Know About You"" Foul Call one of the most commonly missed calls? That was supposed to be a point of emphasis this year! You know how that goes, they always start the year that way, but it gets reverted back to the status quo just before tournament time. Sometimes you can expect that call to be more like the coaches vote in the offseason in the big dance, where the best refs advance, but you can't count on it. The first few minutes of the game really dictate how well the Pistol Shrimps will perform, a smaller, quicker team that benefits from the referees knowing about them."
Earwolf,33gxb5,istartriots,5,Wed Apr 22 17:04:43 2015 UTC,Great stuff.
Earwolf,33gxb5,angieseaanemone,5,Wed Apr 22 17:27:26 2015 UTC,This is hilarious. I wonder where they found the fish logo. It's the logo of a popular seafood sustainability certification from the Vancouver Aquarium. Hahah.
Earwolf,33gxb5,peon_taking_credit,3,Wed Apr 22 22:09:20 2015 UTC,Don't know why I'm so surprised but this is actually really funny.

Earwolf,33im14,buddistnuddist,5,Wed Apr 22 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"Mike is prolly working on his studio, while Mike is really just trying to get to work on Topicon and work on his theses.  Also, Michael Ian Black isn't to good with keeping his podcasts regularly updated. He does another hilarious podcast, Mike & Tom Eat Snacks, that you could listen too while waiting for Topics. He plays a somewhat different Charac though.   I'd listen to it from the beginning, cuz there's a lot of in jokes about Storm Troopers and MATES headquarters."
Earwolf,33im14,Drew_Eckse,3,Wed Apr 22 20:47:31 2015 UTC,Oh I will definitely be checking out his other podcast. I never knew he had a second. I cant wait to dip my beak what must be the apex of audio entertainment.

Earwolf,33im14,CrouchJr,3,Mon Apr 27 04:03:58 2015 UTC,I hear they have been having a great deal of difficulty sourcing enough organic millet for the upcoming topicon.  They've both been pouring hours and hours into finding a solution.  I suggested quinoa.
Earwolf,33im14,vierkante,2,Thu Apr 23 12:50:35 2015 UTC,Quinoa would absolutely be a good substitution. But that could be a hard change to make because there needs to be a consideration for the various types and their biology. Hmm...
Earwolf,33gpc6,JasmineForsythe,15,Wed Apr 22 11:32:08 2015 UTC,This is one of the funniest episodes in a while. Ken has great comedic chemistry with Howard and Kulap. Their Winnie the Pooh impressions were flawless

Earwolf,33hq6u,Slayner,8,Wed Apr 22 16:47:46 2015 UTC,Try /r/podcasts They have tons of helpful material.
Earwolf,33hq6u,branmuffinzed,5,Wed Apr 22 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue is the sheer volume of podcasts out there these days... standing out is tough. Are you wanting to do the podcast for affirmation from listeners, or for yourself? The former is especially tricky and the reason why a lot of podcasters bail. If it's therapeutic, as it may be, then awesome, go hog wild, it might turn out a few people really like you and your listener base can grow from there. I'm just speaking generally of course, finding your 'hook' is the critical part."
Earwolf,33hq6u,JasmineForsythe,4,Wed Apr 22 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"It would definitely be something more for me then anything.   I enjoy talking with people about their interests and obsessions and rather then discussing it with people via Internet text I was thinking it may be fun to start a podcast in which I invite one or two people with the simple premise of their obsession.   Then for about an hour or so we just shoot the shit and talk about it. I can get to know random people better and learn more about why they love what they love.  In the most simple way of describing it that's kinda what I was thinking.   Nothing ground breaking, there's probably hundreds like that, but maybe if I can get people from various subreddits including here that share an interest with chatting with me about whatever for about an hour it may be fun.   Again -- just for me to talk and shoot the shit with someone on a more personal level.   If I get some listeners great, but more than anything I think it'd be for myself to just relax and have something to work on.   Idk baby steps as far as putting pen to paper"
Earwolf,33hq6u,agatagopee,4,Wed Apr 22 17:58:09 2015 UTC,"i have one and it's very fun to do but lots of hard work (that thankfully my co-host does). i'd say if you're interested, invest in a soundboard and a couple decent mics. expect editing to be brutal. we mostly do it just to have fun but it's pretty cool when people you don't know start liking something you do. ours is www.twb.cool if you want to check it out (we've had both sean and hayes on!)"
Earwolf,33hq6u,agatagopee,3,Wed Apr 22 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"I've actually listened to both your Hayes and Sean episode. Really fun listen!   I do expect editing to be annoying and I expect to put some hard work into it if I do decide to do it, but that's fine - so long as I have fun doing it then hell I'll just listen to a podcast or two while I do it.   As far as the equipment goes, yeah I fully expect if I decide to do it I'll invest in what I need to make it not sound horrible. Nothings worse than horrible audio quality for an hour straight."

Earwolf,33hq6u,ReliableSource,2,Wed Apr 22 18:40:09 2015 UTC,I just listened to Sean's episode.  Shit was on fleek.  You guys do have a great chemistry! a lot of fun to listen to.     P.S.  youre a superstar on the forums. respect.
Earwolf,33hq6u,ReliableSource,3,Thu Apr 23 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"I did a podcast with a friend that was a typical ""four dudes sit around drinking and shooting the shit"" format, and we did about 30 episodes before it kinda just stopped happening. I had a lot of fun doing it though, and it felt good to actually be making something.  I've since started doing improv, and through that have met a bunch of other like-minded people, and I'm currently planning on doing a character podcast with some people from the troupe."
Earwolf,33hq6u,gs-fl-bi,2,Wed Apr 22 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"Ah man that's awesome, as far as the general idea I have I don't really plan on having a permanent co-host or anything (if I actually decide to do it) but rather invite one to two people on to shoot the shit with them.   Mainly that way the only reason I'll stop doing it is if I want to. Don't have to rely on someone else getting bored.   Love me some improv podcasts though, good luck on yours if you decide to start back up"
Earwolf,33hq6u,ReliableSource,3,Wed Apr 22 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely the toughest thing about the show I used to do was the fact that it depended on more than one person. Lesson learned."

Earwolf,33epks,BlunderBear,-1,Tue Apr 21 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"I can't say I understand the question, but I'll answer a different question.  The best John Frusciante album is 'to record only water for ten days'. The rest were mostly recorded hastily in order to get money for drugs"
Earwolf,33epks,GiantDeviantPiano,5,Wed Apr 22 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"That's a complete exaggeration, and untrue unless you're stuck in the year 2000. Frusciante has been sober since the late 90s. Only two of his solo albums are from his addiction days. He's released at least 8 solo albums since then. To Record Only Water for Ten Days is great, and Scott is either referring to that album or the first Ataxia album. He does quite a bit of genre hopping in his solo career. To Record... is like a mix of existential acoustic songs over lo fi  electronic beats. Lot of his songs there are quite catchy.  Curtains is one of his best albums, it's mostly acoustic, beautiful songs with sparse experimentation thrown in (including a solo from the Mars Volta's Omar Rod.Lopez.) Shadows Collide with People and The Empyrean are two of his most ambitious records, and focus more on fuller production. He released 6 albums in 2004 in a creative fury, and they're all at least pretty good, Curtains being one of the best.  I'd avoid his most recent stuff from the past 2 or 3 years, he's completely abandoned traditional songwriting and has been making experimental electronic music... anyway I just wanted to throw props out there for his solo career, I think it doesn't get enough credit. Especially with the latest Chili Peppers album without him being as dull as it is."
Earwolf,33epks,MysticBounce,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"Of course I'm exaggerating, and tbh my 'opinion' was probably created around 2004.  I kinda stopped keeping up with him then   He was my guitar idol for years, Blood Sugar still probably has my favourite guitar stuff and is up there with my GOAT albums.    I missed a lot it seems, that 2004 year you mentioned looks insanely prolific.  I'm listening to Curtains now and a few songs in - its great.  I also didn't know he'd played on those first two Mars Volta records  Anything else you recommend, Ataxia? stuff with Omar?"

Earwolf,337p17,read_the_article_,5,Mon Apr 20 18:08:30 2015 UTC,"I think the issue was (which isn't really bad) that Tom Green was trying to have an interesting conversation (between 2 people) instead of an entertaining conversation with Scott. And in turn, Scott was trying to have an entertaining conversation for the listeners benefit.   So the flow clashed everytime Tom would respond to Scott in that mode of conversation after Scott would lead off with something silly/entertaining.  And yeah, the talking over Scott didn't help much. I am looking forward to see how Scott would do Tom Green's podcast as a guest host though.  C-"

Earwolf,337p17,sevillianrites,12,Tue Apr 21 18:22:45 2015 UTC,"Eh, you gotta remember CBB pretends to be an interview show when it's really not. This show is very likely, completely different than most of the shows these people tend to go on. It's not weird for me that occasionally a guest will treat it more like a regular talk show than the nonstop comedy circle jerk that it is (which I positively ADORE). Especially if they're unfamiliar with the show's format or its over arching humor. This problem tends to arise every time you get someone outside the general sphere of anti-comedy. This is the issue with a lot of the musical guest eps too. It's not the guests' faults. It's not Scott's fault. It's just a logistical issue that comes from the show (and podcasting in general) being somewhat niche, despite its popularity.  I mean, would you be upset if Scott played a live set with your favorite band and bombed? Of course not. That sort of thing is just not his forte. Just as character improv and wacky anti-humor bits aren't a lot of these guests fortes. But I still think we should admire and respect the people who at least try at it."
Earwolf,337p17,thelostdolphin,4,Tue Apr 21 02:58:40 2015 UTC,"But Tom just did the TV show. If he spent a day taping that, he's going to understand the absurdity and meta humor that Scott likes. When he comes on the podcast, Scott can just say it's like the TV show and anyone with half a % point of comedy IQ is immediately going to get it."
Earwolf,337p17,temporarychair,5,Tue Apr 21 11:23:37 2015 UTC,"Very well said. I feel some guests get too much shit for not immediately picking up on the tone of the show, especially anyone who hasn't heard the show before.   This all just makes me wonder how much prep they give the guests before they go on. Do they try to explain the absurdity of it or just throw them in the water?  Either way, I feel like Scott deserves credit for the fact that it rarely, if ever, feels like jokes are being made at the guests expense. Its more like whether they're along for the ride or not."
Earwolf,337p17,thursdayaug22,2,Tue Apr 21 04:23:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think there's tons of guests that come in from outside and do just fine. Just in the last year, Alicia Witt was totally on-board for all sorts of nonsense. Tears for Fears was amazing. Tash.2 was weirdly interesting but totally seemed into it. These people aren't even comedians. It actually seems more likely for comedians to derail and destroy the show than people outside of comedy- people who should be pretty aware of the joke before coming into the studio."

Earwolf,337p17,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Thu Apr 23 19:20:45 2015 UTC,Your premise depends on a reality where a comedic personality like Tom Green hasn't somehow been made aware of or come into contact with Comedy Bang Bang in the 6 years since it's been a podcast or the 13 years since Comedy Death Ray started doing alt shows in LA.

I mean it was not a very apporpriate time to be talking about it and he kept bringing it up. After a while I thought he was trying to make a joke by bringing the mood down so low. But then he never bounced back and kinda stayed there for the rest of the episode.. he was funny with the Carson bit but that was it.
Earwolf,337p17,StickerBrush,9,Mon Apr 20 23:35:34 2015 UTC,"Well in his defense, he expressed several times his distaste of the subject and his wish to change it, only to have Scott keep it going."

After seeing some of his standup, I couldn't really understand how he still had a career in comedy. He surprised me in this ep with a handful of actually funny quips.

Earwolf,337p17,oshoney,2,Mon Apr 20 23:39:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, but when he brought it up in the first time that was all him. For a fleeting moment I thought it might be some next-level subversive comedy thing of bringing up a real and super depressing topic right in the middle of the funny character part of a comedy podcast. I could see Tim Heidecker doing something like that, but he would have made it up and it would've been deliberate and I don't think that was the case with Tom.

Earwolf,337p17,thursdayaug22,5,Mon Apr 20 08:17:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this one had funny moments but I think Tom needed to calm down a bit.  There's nothing wrong with the beginning section being a straight forward interview. Scott does that quite often.  But when the character guests come in, the dynamic needs to shift.  I think Tom just spoke too much for a room that's dynamic had shifted to include two other character guests and they probably didn't get to breathe. The dog thing didn't bother me as a topic since Tom seemed to be aware it was a downer and I can appreciate that they all tried to make the best of it.  I like both Mary Holland and Erin Whitehead but they kinda got buried. Trabitha returning probably should've been it's own focused section or episode and the therapist character didn't have time to take off, imo.  Lesson to take away: Main guests should probably hang back during character sections or figure out how to balance their comments with the character's."

Earwolf,335ozy,bernardolv,28,Sun Apr 19 20:10:00 2015 UTC,"Episodes with Ben Schwartz aren't continuity driven but there are so many callbacks to older appearances of his that they might as well be (plus he is always a delight). I think that his appearance with Werner (PFT) is the best place to jump in there.  Claudia O'Daugherty is another. She plays a heightened version of herself, and each of her appearances can be taken on their own, but they are really fun when you listen to them all together. Plus her most recent appearance still has me doing her impression ALL THE TIME (I kind of don't want to spoil it).  The Exorcism of Cake Boss is a great episode that can be taken completely on its own even though it is entirely story driven (I just don't want you to overlook it because there isn't a specific lead up to it).  JW Stillwater might be another to look into. They don't really build up a narrative with him until his most recent appearance, but it is fun to build up to that episode because all of his other appearance were a delight.  Marissa Wompler's Birthdays are also usually really funny. Weirdly, I think it would be best to start with the episode leading into her the 5th year extravaganza (I think they do a good job of filling everyone on her extensive back story in that episode), and then jumping back to the the first Womptacular and then into the most recent one. Wompler is probably the hardest character to crack, as she just has SO much back story it can hard to understand what it going on. I do think it is worth it because the Womptacular's had me howling.  Some more asides: Gino eps are always funny, the Halloween eps have some continuity, but I haven't listened to them all (I have enjoyed the ones that I have), Neil Campbell and Paul Rust both always play the weirdest characters so those eps are usually really strange.  If you still need more, just download eps from people that you like. It is hard to go wrong with PFT, Lapkus, Kroll, or Daly. Scott is always making content, so you have plenty to choose from."
Earwolf,335ozy,requisite_monocle,5,Sun Apr 19 21:05:01 2015 UTC,The Halloween eps are amazing! They're always some of my favorites. I love how each year they have a cool new Halloween song to sing.

Earwolf,331ndx,mattisafriend,2,Sat Apr 18 19:47:52 2015 UTC,Paul Scheer said on one of the mini episodes that they don't want to do the prequels because they have nothing to say about them that hasn't already been said many times. He mentions that the Red Letter Media reviews have covered everything they could possibly bring up so they don't believe they could bring anything new or funny to the table.
Earwolf,331ndx,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Sun Apr 19 09:59:34 2015 UTC,The RLM prequel reviews are so well-regarded that people are already  suspecting J.J. Abrams did this intentionally as a tribute to Mr. Plinkett.

Earwolf,3312kw,CakeBoss16,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:00:05 2015 UTC,Is that the 'white men are black men too' album? That's those guys right? They were playing that a lot in the apt I was staying in last weekend. Sounds a whole lot like TV on the Radio.
Earwolf,3312kw,oshoney,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:32:18 2015 UTC,Yes those are the guys. What do you mean TV on the radio?
Earwolf,3312kw,CakeBoss16,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"TV on the Radio is a band. A very good one, that's been around for over a decade. And these Young Fathers dudes sound a lot like them. Not saying they ripped off their style... But it's certainly influenced by them."

Still, I wouldn't have minded getting the Father John Misty 45 or the Vampire Weekend single. I haven't heard any of KMD's stuff, but I love MF DOOM so I bet I would be into it.   Did anyone get anything? Anything you wished you had gotten? Previous Record Store Day purchases, or just any record purchases in general that you want to share?   edit: I can't believe I forgot about Run The Jewels. Damn, maybe I should've gone."

Earwolf,3312kw,oshoney,3,Tue Apr 21 03:57:44 2015 UTC,Anybody else been listening to Kumail Nanjiani's The X-Files Files podcast? It returned last week and I'm so grateful for it.  It's incredible to me that a comedian got me into a television show that premiered 3 years before I was even born.
Earwolf,3312kw,dcfc821,3,Tue Apr 21 04:17:42 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about using that as an excuse to watch x-files for the first time but I've just got so many p-casts backed up that it's hard to make time.
Earwolf,3312kw,nicemaker,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's practically triple the time because you have to watch two 45 minute episodes before listening to an hour+ podcast.

Earwolf,3312kw,nicemaker,2,Sat Apr 18 19:33:05 2015 UTC,Did Chappelle do 4 hours or was it a regular length performance?
Earwolf,3312kw,oshoney,2,Sat Apr 18 20:21:21 2015 UTC,"Longer than I thought it'd be. Can't remember the guys name but ashy Larry opened for like 40 minutes or so then chappelle did like 2 hours. God damn it was great, I could have easily sat there for 4 hours."
Earwolf,3312kw,CrouchJr,2,Sat Apr 18 14:07:26 2015 UTC,Did it seem like 2 hours of prepared material or was he riffing a bunch?
Earwolf,3312kw,oshoney,2,Sat Apr 18 14:10:21 2015 UTC,Oh man it wouldn't surprise me if he didn't have more than like 15 minutes of material. It was just a lot of riffing. But seriously he killed.

Earwolf,3312kw,oshoney,1 point,Sun Apr 19 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"Ya, even the league must be upset about it.  I guess I was hoping he would at least go to an east coast team so I could watch him haha.

I think PFT is an absolute genius when playing characters on CBB, but I just don't find his ""out of charac"" sense of humor to be that funny most of the time. I wish I did because I really like him and admire his talent, and he has brought me SO many belly laughs on CBB. But I have no control over this and having seen literally nothing but praise for Spontaneanation, I just had to get this out. You may now eviscerate me."

Earwolf,33099d,under_chemist,7,Sat Apr 18 07:26:55 2015 UTC,It is discussed further in the Exorcism of Cake Boss cake boss

Earwolf,32xkq4,ksaid1,9,Fri Apr 17 16:54:59 2015 UTC,They should get Gillian Jacobs for this!
Earwolf,32xkq4,RadioRaheem_,3,Fri Apr 17 15:35:29 2015 UTC,Aren't they writing a Deadpool story soon or has that already happened? I know he just recently died but that doesn't mean the story is over.
Earwolf,32xkq4,ksaid1,2,Fri Apr 17 15:53:24 2015 UTC,I think they're each writing their own separate short Deadpool stories that are all being published in the same issue.
Earwolf,32xkq4,downwithlevers,2,Fri Apr 17 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"The issue is out now, I went and bought it to read their stories."

Earwolf,32xkq4,downwithlevers,4,Fri Apr 17 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"I was happy to support them with my cash but personally I didn't think the stories were that good. Although I'm sure it's hard to write a really awesome comic in 5 pages.   After the main book, which is written by Gerry Duggan and Brian Posehn, there are multiple 5 page stories. One by Zouks, one by Scotty Aux, one by Paul Scheer & Nick Giovannetti, one by Acker & Blacker (Thrilling Adventure Hour), one by Mike Drucker (writes for Fallon among other things), and one by Matt Selman (the Simpsons)."
Earwolf,32xkq4,thecricketnerd,2,Fri Apr 17 17:02:07 2015 UTC,He wrote part of the story of the latest issue (Deadpool #250).
Earwolf,32xkq4,Prax150,2,Fri Apr 17 16:08:49 2015 UTC,And a fun one it was!
Earwolf,32xkq4,RadioRaheem_,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"Issue 250 features short side stories written by Scott, Scheer and a few others. Posehn wrote on the main story. Really good issue, and might be the last for a while from what I understand, you should pick it up"
Earwolf,32xkq4,Prax150,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:16:42 2015 UTC,I fell off the Deadpool bandwagon and honestly the comic bandwagon after Issue 20 or so. Probably gonna catch up with trades soon. Just recently started Black Widow though and it's pretty good.
Earwolf,32xkq4,headless_bourgeoisie,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't read much of the recent Deadpool and honestly, other than a couple of references I didn't have a problem. Considering it's the last issue before Secret Wars it might be worth picking up anyway. Also it has the naked ghost of Benjamin Franklin."
Earwolf,32xkq4,Prax150,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, spoilers for Deadpool... Of which I have never read even a single issue."
Earwolf,32xkq4,headless_bourgeoisie,3,Sat Apr 18 08:09:31 2015 UTC,With Wolfpop around there's really no reason for this not to happen now. I know all these guys are really busy but this idea is too perfect.
Earwolf,32xkq4,comiclover1377,3,Fri Apr 17 21:17:33 2015 UTC,If Patton isn't involved somehow it will be a complete waste of everyone's time and money.
Earwolf,32xfra,Courtesy_F1ush,14,Fri Apr 17 14:53:16 2015 UTC,Well at least we kind of get June today.   She has been missed.
Earwolf,32xfra,Pierce2089,-18,Fri Apr 17 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"The thing I don't get about all the June absences - and she shouldn't take this the wrong way - but this is basically what she is most famous for. Paul and Jason have a bit more fame but don't miss the recordings. She needs to record about 90 minutes every other week, not sure what the deal is."
Earwolf,32xfra,jarluch,24,Fri Apr 17 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"That's not really true at all, she actually works just as much as both of them (besides maybe Paul because he's really the most busy person ever) and she is a brand new mom. And she is very well known, just because you found out about her because of this doesn't mean it's what she's famous for. I'd argue outside of comedy nerd circles she's more famous than Jason"
Earwolf,32xfra,Memphish_Boognish,2,Fri Apr 17 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"She had a fairly big role in Anchorman 2, which is a huge deal. She also appeared in all 3 seasons of Burning Love and starred in the second season, and she has a big role in NTSF:SD:SUV. I'd say she's doing fine and will continue to do fine."
Earwolf,32xfra,jakeupnorth,9,Mon Apr 20 16:34:12 2015 UTC,Isn't she filming something out of state ?
Earwolf,32xfra,sauze,6,Fri Apr 17 16:51:30 2015 UTC,I think it's more to do with the newborn.   A baby plus the work she already has (not sure what she is working on at the moment but it's gotta be something) is a lot to handle.   I just hope we get the three of them together again soon.
Earwolf,32xfra,Pierce2089,8,Fri Apr 17 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, probably the only comedy/acting people that are known specifically for their podcasts are like Scott, Jimmy Pardo, and Mark Maron. June is an accomplished actress with a lot of credits. And this probably has zero to do with some sort of power trip about being too good for the podcast, as you make it sound."
Earwolf,32xfra,Prax150,4,Fri Apr 17 21:15:29 2015 UTC,Marc Marone has been a popular stand up comedian since the early 90's!

Earwolf,32xfra,Michael__Pemulis,5,Fri Apr 17 17:36:31 2015 UTC,Screenwriters are always excellent guests on this show.
Earwolf,32xfra,ThorManhammer,8,Fri Apr 17 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"I wish Monica Potter had made it, I feel like we missed out on some great Nick Cage stories"
Earwolf,32xfra,mi-16evil,5,Fri Apr 17 22:32:47 2015 UTC,"I randomly met Monica Potter's mom...I guess. Basically I was a cashier at a grocery store and this lady just randomly says ""I'm Monica Potter's mom"" and I said ""who"" and she said ""she was in the Last House on the Left remake"" and I said ""okay"". One of the weirdest interactions I've had."
Earwolf,32xfra,AgentMullWork,2,Sat Apr 18 17:03:08 2015 UTC,Hopefully Paul works her into the minisode
Earwolf,32xfra,IBIZABAR,9,Fri Apr 17 23:43:45 2015 UTC,I love live episodes of HDTGM much better than in the studio. Keep them coming please!
Earwolf,32xfra,AgentMullWork,14,Fri Apr 17 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"I like them both. Live shows have more energy, but I also love hearing them discuss things without an audience interruption. Lots of comments seem to get lost in the laughter, and i like hearing them bounce off each other faster.    I sort of wish they would release some of these live shows faster. We already know what the next movie is, now we have to wait two weeks to listen to face off. They're making money on tickets on top of the ads, so it seems like it wouldn't be that bad a deal for them to move a little faster."
Earwolf,32xfra,turnk,2,Fri Apr 17 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"Yes it would be nice to get this show a little more often, but you have to realize this show requires homework which I bet can sometimes be difficult to organize with guests which is why they release them every other week. And live shows are a great way for them to record 2 shows in one night."
Earwolf,32xfra,AgentMullWork,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"I would pay for a weekly podcast with just Paul, Zouks, and a guest discussing some of the more coherent but bonkers films like this one (June could come too if she has time). Maybe bring on another host like Scott (Adam) or whoever."
Earwolf,32xfra,I_SHIT_ON_CATS,3,Sat Apr 18 01:36:54 2015 UTC,Wish they would save some of these amaZing films for studio casts.

Earwolf,32xycg,darlini,6,Sat Apr 18 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"It was just under 20 minutes in length. Of which maybe 10 or so was spent actually talking about my ""issue"", the rest was just sort of chatting about where I live and the area, Howard getting derailed a few times, like whether I'd pay to watch an EarWolf threesome with Ronna and Beverly, and 'Stard.   I had a blast, though I wish prepared a little bit, and wrote down stuff I wanted to mention before hand. Because I had a couple things I wanted to ask/say, but totally forgot."

The first several are definitely the exact same episode, but VERY quickly they start subverting expectations.    Not to mention the entire thing is a style parody of old superhero shows where the catch phrases are repeated in every episode (for kids!).  That's part of the gag.  If the repetitiveness is a problem, start with episode #110 with the introduction of the Righteous Brothers, it starts subverting everything that they've established in the first episodes of it.    Also, Patrick the overweight adventurekateer is always hilarious."

Earwolf,32w3g6,hellohelicopter,6,Fri Apr 17 04:52:51 2015 UTC,I was just going to post about this. I think it's awesome. Very strange and funny. Top notch cast. I hope Milana Vayntrub makes more Earwolf appearances because she's funny and I like her.
Earwolf,32w3g6,RedFrogMario,1 point,Fri Apr 17 14:10:18 2015 UTC,"She's only been on the Hooray Show, right?   EDIT: just checked her Earwolf page, duh, and she was on Yo Is This Racist a bunch of times a couple years ago."
Earwolf,32w3g6,nyan_swanson,3,Fri Apr 17 18:59:24 2015 UTC,"Her appearances on Doug Loves Movies were very funny. although the fellas really talked over and ignored her in a mildly cringe-worthy way.   Join me next time on Yo Is This Misogynist, with your host, a man."
Earwolf,32w3g6,nohorseman,3,Fri Apr 17 19:35:27 2015 UTC,I just finished it up.  I loved it!  Super funny and cheesy.  I really wish there were more than 8 episodes

Earwolf,32sznc,TheandreGreyjordan,8,Fri Apr 17 16:38:56 2015 UTC,Incredibly innovative idea.  Some incredible films have been featured on The Black List in the past few years.  So exciting!
Earwolf,32sznc,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Thu Apr 16 15:10:50 2015 UTC,What if one of these ends up getting made? We can say we heard it way back when...
Earwolf,32sznc,franklinleonard,4,Thu Apr 16 15:13:45 2015 UTC,Earwolf and Wolfpop are consistently releasing podcasts that are too good not to listen to

Earwolf,32sznc,mark10579,3,Fri Apr 17 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"Wait, ""The Black List"" isn't doubling as a racial pun? Little disappointed.  But seriously I hope at some point read Twittels and Aziz's script."
Earwolf,32sznc,Fatmanredemption,6,Thu Apr 16 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"It kind of is, he said it was an intentional subversion of the idea that black is negative (in addition to a tribute to screenwriters that were persecuted in the McCarthy era)"

Definitely my favorite ad read to date."
Earwolf,32tm8p,CrouchJr,3,Thu Apr 16 16:47:40 2015 UTC,Yes I remember that..... I'm thinking 10ish episodes back?  Does that seem reasonable?

Earwolf,32uvrn,LostMyPotato,2,Fri Apr 17 07:28:08 2015 UTC,"I like it. It's pretty slapstick ridiculous but that's what makes it funny. Plus all the actor/actress appearances make it that much more interesting. I actually just finished watching the 10th episode and was trying to figure out the song that kathy baker is singing in the truck alone while the drug heist is going down. The lyrics are ""won't you come around, and lay your troubles down."" and its like this 70's folk song it's really bothering me that I can't figure it out."

Earwolf,32smtl,Slayner,7,Thu Apr 16 11:44:11 2015 UTC,I'm really curious who the monologuist was that Matt was referencing. Anyone good at googling to find out?
Earwolf,32smtl,mi-16evil,8,Thu Apr 16 13:55:18 2015 UTC,"Ok so I did a little digging and I think it might be Matthew Gray Gubler.  Based on the criteria we know of the monologuist: He is an actor on a TV show.  He tweeted that he would be on ASSSSCAT.  It was probably recent, considering the Hilary Clinton news.  The most recent ASSSSCAT was on April 12th at UCB Sunset and that is when Matthew Gray Gluber was the monologuist.  Also, judging by this tweet and this tweet, the crowd seems to fit the description from today's I4H episode."

Earwolf,32smtl,autowikibot,0,Thu Apr 16 15:02:12 2015 UTC,Looks like it! Surprised Criminal Minds has such a young following.
Earwolf,32smtl,mi-16evil,5,Thu Apr 16 15:21:13 2015 UTC,I did a little searching and I think it was Matthew Gray Gubler

Earwolf,32smtl,mi-16evil,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:22:34 2015 UTC,It's gotta have something to do with white water rafting right?
Earwolf,32smtl,mark10579,7,Thu Apr 16 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"This was a solid episode. I loved every scene! And I know everyone hates Besser's rants but I think it adds to his charm, believe it or not. It's funny to hear someone get so worked up about 14 year old girls not knowing who Hillary Clinton is."
Earwolf,32smtl,fryreportingforduty,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree, I actually enjoy his rants. I just also usually roll my eyes at some of them.   The only rant I thoroughly did not enjoy was his gun control debate. My favorite one was the one recently about Monica and the bullying thing."
Earwolf,32smtl,fryreportingforduty,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:00:03 2015 UTC,Meh even those don't bother me. But I grew up with a dad who is very similar to how Matt voices his opinion and stand his ground so maybe I've grown numb to it lol.
Earwolf,32smtl,ivtecdoyou,5,Thu Apr 16 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"Oh god Bessers gonna rant about how we should all vote for Hillary Clinton. This is gonna be a great controversial start to my morning   Edit: never mind he didn't really go off too hard on a rant. Moved on pretty quickly too. Wonder if Matt is trying not to lay down his politics too much or if he wasn't in the mood or something.   Anyway good episode, I loved the autograph scene, and the cookie guy scene. I love the crazy voices Matt does."
Earwolf,32smtl,House_Of_Pies,4,Thu Apr 16 11:45:32 2015 UTC,"Matt is certainly not one to hold back on his politics, he likely just didn't feel like going in to it.   Don't worry, he will go HAM closer to election time. I'm not into politics in the slightest and don't know shit about any candidate, so it might be one of the few Besser rants I can sit through."
Earwolf,32smtl,mark10579,0,Thu Apr 16 13:24:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know he usually never holds back that's why this one surprised me.   The election is gonna be grueling, not that I care other people have different political views then me but let's just say Matt and I couldn't be more different when it comes to that stuff."
Earwolf,32smtl,House_Of_Pies,3,Thu Apr 16 13:27:41 2015 UTC,I usually don't mind Besser's rants (although the entire month and half of The Angry Trumpet Guy taking over the show was getting on my nerves) but I think it's really funny to me how he can't possibly imagine any scenario in which someone might not like Hilary Clinton lol.
Earwolf,32smtl,mark10579,3,Thu Apr 16 14:25:22 2015 UTC,He's got this weird paternalistic thing where all women have to like Hilary because a) she's a woman so he can pretend it's a feminist issue and b) he likes her and he knows best. It's weirdly sexist at its core and it annoys me but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Earwolf,32smtl,pilksahoy,6,Thu Apr 16 14:40:04 2015 UTC,I think it's also because they are from Arkansas and so he has that connection with the Clintons.
Earwolf,32smtl,House_Of_Pies,3,Thu Apr 16 14:53:56 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. It's just so weird to hear someone have such pride in a politician. Like, has she never done anything he disagrees with?"
Earwolf,32smtl,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Thu Apr 16 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"He was going off on Twitter earlier in the week about how any criticism regarding her e-mail scandal and Benghazi was just people ""parroting the Koch brothers"".  I'm really liberal, and I'd probably vote for Hillary if I was American, but to suggest she doesn't have a questionable track record is pretty dishonest."
Earwolf,32smtl,Brettster,3,Thu Apr 16 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"Oh god the angry trumpet guy was my least favorite thing ever to happen on I4H.   I disagreed with that guy so hard, but the fact that Matt treated him like a hero for like a solid 2 months and kept having him on for his other opinions was agonizing."
Earwolf,32smtl,DanzigMeowMeow,7,Thu Apr 16 14:40:21 2015 UTC,I just remembered his name.  Doug Levinson.  The worst was when Matt had Doug call into the show and talk about the incident and Doug is just rambling on and on about a fucking parade that he organized for a dog.
Earwolf,32t9sh,oshoney,5,Thu Apr 16 15:15:24 2015 UTC,I really liked the first episode.  It's pretty disappointing that there isn't a true episode this week.  it seems like they could have had a little foresight and recorded some episodes ahead of time to have a little bit of a backlog.
Earwolf,32t9sh,House_Of_Pies,2,Thu Apr 16 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like they dropped the ball here. You gotta build momentum.  PFT implied in SPONT that he had many episodes in the can before they went live."
Earwolf,32t9sh,GiantDeviantPiano,3,Fri Apr 17 01:34:14 2015 UTC,"Same thing with UTU2TM? and Nerd Poker, off the top of my head."
Earwolf,32t9sh,House_Of_Pies,3,Fri Apr 17 01:38:19 2015 UTC,"Well, PFT learned his lesson the hard way by having a beloved podcast and just having no back episodes recorded."

Earwolf,32rgw9,Slayner,4,Thu Apr 16 02:59:00 2015 UTC,Yeah the dead authors podcast is great. I've been thinking of re-listening to them all lately. PFT does so good as HG Wells
Earwolf,32rgw9,GiantDeviantPiano,7,Thu Apr 16 03:00:11 2015 UTC,That's one of his character where I forget its PFT.  His British phrases and use of words are on point.  The other one: #ClassicJarles
Earwolf,32rgw9,Home-Baked,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:42:49 2015 UTC,He does consistently make one little error though which is using the long 'a' sound in 'class' in 'classic' when it should be short like in 'tack'. Such a minor thing but the rest is so perfect it jumps out.
Earwolf,32rgw9,GiantDeviantPiano,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:46:55 2015 UTC,"Depends where you're from, never noticed that myself"

Earwolf,32rja5,Slayner,6,Thu Apr 16 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"It was a great episode. I especially liked how tig kept pushing kyle to date her, and how uncomfortable kyle was with it. The whole episode seemed fun"

Earwolf,32osj3,mi-16evil,9,Wed Apr 15 18:06:35 2015 UTC,I was there mew was so hilarious. I love Margaux the Fat Guy.   Also I though my podcast app was broken at the very very end... Then I realized. Brilliant.
Earwolf,32osj3,KillerPotato_BMW,4,Wed Apr 15 16:10:32 2015 UTC,It was a genius way to end the podcast.
Earwolf,32osj3,KillerPotato_BMW,7,Wed Apr 15 16:50:15 2015 UTC,I'm going to re-listen to the Glimmer Man episode of HDTGM (episode 71). I recall they discussed Stephen's character's 'death' scene.
Earwolf,32osj3,DanzigMeowMeow,8,Wed Apr 15 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see this actor, I instantly flashback to Powers Boothe telling him ""A man might use that time to put some stink on his johnson"" in Deadwood."
Earwolf,32osj3,KillerPotato_BMW,8,Wed Apr 15 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, by the way, Groundhog Day is available on Amazon Instant for free if you have Prime subscription."
Earwolf,32osj3,gulospizzapaddle,5,Wed Apr 15 16:54:05 2015 UTC,Also streaming on US Netflix

Earwolf,32osj3,VanceFerguson,3,Wed Apr 15 23:26:58 2015 UTC,"I own a Maine Coon Cat, and yes, they are chatty catties. And, to confirm Mr. Girley's assertion, Fuzz is also a big, fat asshole."
Earwolf,32osj3,splice_of_life,3,Wed Apr 15 19:30:44 2015 UTC,Man I can't wait to listen to this tomorrow
Earwolf,32osj3,sketchyTK,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:21:26 2015 UTC,I highly recommend The Tobolowsky Files for anyone who wants to hear more great actor's tales and strange true life stories. Tobo is a master storyteller.
Earwolf,32pdar,CakeBoss16,30,Wed Apr 15 17:11:49 2015 UTC,I have been 100% unsuccessful in getting my friends to even laugh at a podcast. It's mind boggling to me but I've learned to just embrace /r/earwolf as my place to discuss podcasts and leave my friends alone with it.   In short it's their loss.
Earwolf,32pdar,Slayner,3,Wed Apr 15 17:14:01 2015 UTC,That might be the sad truth but I have gotten one friend into podcast. I suggested i4h which is probably the most consistent podcast due to the formula besser. Than gave him suggestion based on interest. I just wish they was a easy sharable way to get people into podcasts.
Earwolf,32pdar,Slayner,5,Wed Apr 15 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I4H is definitely the easiest to get people to even attempt but I haven't even had luck with that. I truly don't get it, we have similar interests in comedy but when it comes to actually listening to a podcast it's like they have a mental stubbornness to not enjoy it."
Earwolf,32pdar,Condawg,5,Wed Apr 15 17:24:46 2015 UTC,I think their needs to be a service that surveys the person and then suggest a podcast or like a Pandora for podcast. I know wync has something similar.
Earwolf,32pdar,unholypencil,3,Wed Apr 15 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Once that friend gets more into Besser, you can suggest any episode of CBB with Besser as a transition to that. Or the Travel Bug episode of ADPPP, Besser was on point in that."
Earwolf,32pdar,tiredofnick,6,Wed Apr 15 19:40:33 2015 UTC,The Travel Bug is easily my favorite episode of any comedy podcast ever.
Earwolf,32pdar,Slayner,3,Thu Apr 16 08:50:34 2015 UTC,hmm yes speak on that.
Earwolf,32pdar,tiredofnick,7,Wed Apr 15 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Hollywood Handbook. It's by far the worst podcast to start someone on. My friend asked why I was laughing so hard one day, I let him listen and tried to explain the show. It was the worst failed attempt yet."
Earwolf,32pdar,tkdgns,10,Wed Apr 15 21:39:52 2015 UTC,Ehhh wrong again Slayner! Sean and Hayes is funny and nice and cool and smart. And Hollywood handbook is the ONLY podcast!
Earwolf,32pdar,SirPribsy,2,Wed Apr 15 22:15:33 2015 UTC,It's literally true.
Earwolf,32pdar,comedyprepster,2,Thu Apr 16 15:51:24 2015 UTC,"I got into CBB pretty much first-listen because a friend told me to start with the first time-bobby episode, when fourvel got stabby it sealed the deal. That being said, I think the end of year ""best of"" episodes are a great place to start, especially the ones where they get really inside baseball. Despite that time bobby introduction it took me a while to realize some of these ""real people"" were characters too!"
Earwolf,32pdar,Brettster,4,Thu Apr 16 11:07:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, same. I have a friend who is a huge comedy fan (and loves Call Chelsea Peretti), but for some reason I can't sell her on anything Earwolf. I've tried getting her to listen to Chelsea Peretti eps, but it's like she's written off CBB for being too silly? I feel like Harris trying to get Scott into Phish!"
Earwolf,32pdar,Prax150,2,Wed Apr 15 22:56:35 2015 UTC,CBB is definitely silly. It doesn't ever try to get real on any level. I can understand that not being everyone's thing.
Earwolf,32pdar,DanzigMeowMeow,18,Thu Apr 16 15:52:58 2015 UTC,Due to the popularity of serial    The first podcast!?
Earwolf,32pdar,oshoney,15,Wed Apr 15 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"Guys, we are the podcast hipsters. A year from now when everyone is listening to podcasts we will have moved on to something more underground and cooler. I'm already sending texts via carrier raven."
Earwolf,32pdar,mi-16evil,12,Wed Apr 15 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"I have actually gotten a friend into podcasting. You gotta hook them with something they already love. He's a fan of watching bad movies and he loves the League - so I showed him How Did This Get Made and boom, he has hooked. He now listens to CBB, i4h, IWTT and a few others. I'm so proud."
Earwolf,32pdar,oshoney,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:11:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the breadcrumb approach is best. Get then in to podcasts in general with their interests. My friend loves long interviews so I got him into podcasts via WTF and YMIW. From their you can make connections and build up their library of go tos.
Earwolf,32pdar,spinney,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I should have trained him more though. He started listening to Nerdist because of a few guests that he was interested, but he was listening to every other show regardless of the guest. Maybe it's just me but for me, with interview shows like that I only listen if I have an interest in the guest."
Earwolf,32pdar,RedFrogMario,7,Thu Apr 16 15:12:51 2015 UTC,There is something about the podcast medium that requires a bit more attention to really get hooked. I always seem to notice that if I'm not really listening all the episodes seem very dull (no matter the podcast) because I'm not paying enough attention to really understand what's going. For a lot of people it's rare that they can focus on simply audio for over an hour at a time.
Earwolf,32pdar,sourmilksmell,6,Wed Apr 15 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to suggest specific episodes of your favorite shows, but you have to pick the ones that aren't so inside jokey. A lot of Earwolf stuff is self referential, so it can be tough to get into. For example, if somebody was to listen to that ""listeners again"" episode of Hollywood Handbook without context, I bet they'd be very confused. But if you play something like ""The Calvins Twins"" or ""Solo Bolo"" where you can just tell it's a group of funny people having fun with each other, then you'll have a better shot at getting them in."
Earwolf,32pdar,Slayner,5,Wed Apr 15 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I have a friend who has gotten ever so slightly into CBB because I told them they had American Football as a musical guest. He's super into them, and ended up listening to the rest of the podcast because of zombie John Lennon. It was really cool to finally be able to talk about a podcast to somebody in person!"
Earwolf,32pdar,sourmilksmell,5,Thu Apr 16 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"They would have to have a place for it in their lives. I'm held hostage in a cube for 9 hours a day, then factor in transit time... I'm a nearly perfect podcast audience.  Then you have to factor in that it's device driven. If it's going to take more than a couple clicks, then people will avoid it.   Some people simply refuse. I know a guy that loves Bill Burr, I say again LOVES BILL BURR. Refuses to DL Bill Burr's podcast. His reason? ""I don't listen to podcasts, I watch things on youtube.""  I give up on converting people."
Earwolf,32pdar,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Wed Apr 15 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"That's so ridiculous. his podcast is amazing.   his Thursday afternoon monday morning podcast is really good so far.   Especially the thursday afternoon friday morning edition of the monday morning podcast last week with will forte  Also, I'm going to see him in Savannah for his Billy Bible Belt tour. I'm so excited"
Earwolf,32pdar,ilikemustard,2,Thu Apr 16 00:47:46 2015 UTC,Yep. He just him in Tampa the other day.
Earwolf,32pdar,spagettparty,3,Thu Apr 16 00:59:41 2015 UTC,"I've recommended CBB to a few friends who I knew liked podcasts (mostly UK based) and I think they enjoyed but only listen once in a while.  At least two people regularly listen to Jordan Jess Go! and it seems that that's a really good gateway podcast for alt-comedy.  For people who aren't into 'comedy' I try and recommend specific podcasts.  In the past few months I've recommended 'I was there too' when I found out someone liked HDTGM (and I knew he's a film guy), Go Bayside! a few times when Saved by the bell came up, James Bonding to everyone who'll listen (All British people love James Bond), Cardboard to someone who loves board games.  I'm yet to have a friend who likes U2 or Phish - weird that  I think its good to get them in with a genre based podcast that they'll naturally be into, then if they're in they'll find out more and ask more questions.    I'm not bothered that all my friends don't like Earwolf - that's what I've got you chumps for"
Earwolf,32pdar,Fatmanredemption,3,Thu Apr 16 01:34:28 2015 UTC,Try U Talkin U2 To Me! I've gotten 5 of my friends into it.
Earwolf,32pdar,jaketwo91,2,Thu Apr 16 01:44:30 2015 UTC,"Find out who your friend's favorite comedian is and play them episodes of the podcast with that person as a guest. Every podcast I ever got into was from listening to episodes with Maria Bamford. Except CBB, that was Tim Heidecker."
Earwolf,32pdar,itbeginat3am,2,Wed Apr 15 20:22:47 2015 UTC,"As a fan of the DTFH I very much enjoy podcast introductions and commercials especially when they're laced with absurd psychedelic insight and oddly creative sexual vulgari-- Oh. That's not what this thread's about.  Here's what you do: Recommend them one episode that you think's gonna hit with them. Make sure there's a guest on that they already know about, so they'll listen to it longer.   I first got into Comedy Bang Bang by downloading a bunch of podcast eps with Patton Oswalt. The CBB eps were really off putting to me. This fuckin' podcast where a weird character comes in and ruins a perfectly good interview. But when I listened to the one with Eddie Pepitone as Al the diner marshal? That's when I became a fan. So make sure it's a grep with a guest they already know and a character you think they'll get into."
Earwolf,32pdar,newprofile15,2,Wed Apr 15 23:17:50 2015 UTC,"I like to adjust my suggestions based on reaction. For example I started listening to the worst idea of all time after hearing it on HDTGM. I explained the premise to a few people and one of my friends was like 'oh my god, that movie sucks! How could they do that' and I explained how it has been going so far, and he started listening. Another time I knew my friend loved Benny Schwass from his jake and Amir videos, so I played him a clip from the solo bolo and he's been a CBB listener since."
Earwolf,32p95v,WeeBabySeamus,11,Wed Apr 15 16:40:32 2015 UTC,Damn. That old dude is really sharp for his age. Surprised how well comedically he kept up with The Schwaz
Earwolf,32p95v,biproberts,9,Wed Apr 15 18:57:20 2015 UTC,I wish I had 10% of his charisma.
Earwolf,32p95v,plant_man,7,Wed Apr 15 17:13:27 2015 UTC,"I thought he was going to say ""...I hear Scott Aukerman say House of Pies"""

Earwolf,32p95v,GiantDeviantPiano,8,Wed Apr 15 22:07:40 2015 UTC,"US morning shows get a really bad rap for boring one dimensional interviews. (maybe this is unfair)  This was hilarious, both hosts were really game for anything and they just messed around"

Earwolf,32nv6e,Drocavelli,5,Wed Apr 15 09:33:19 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly he looked really short next to Middleditch in his Silicon Valley scenes and I don't think TM is that tall of a dude. Or maybe he is and that's why Eugene Cordero looked so short.
Earwolf,32nv6e,RadioRaheem_,3,Wed Apr 15 12:16:33 2015 UTC,He's short but ripped.  He really likes fitness.  Monster Muscles!

Earwolf,32kurt,SirPribsy,14,Tue Apr 14 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I would recommend the Iliza episode. While I'm not a fan of her comedy at all, it's a great introduction to their humor. She's an unwitting straight man and it really showcases how they work as a team. And also how insane they are."
Earwolf,32kurt,thehollowpointninja,10,Tue Apr 14 17:21:13 2015 UTC,That's a great one. Love how she's clearly uncomfortable and antagonistic at first and then slowly comes around to find them hilarious.

Earwolf,32kurt,nohorseman,8,Wed Apr 15 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"You have the right attitude! It's worth the time to get into it.   The recent listeners ep lost a little bit of steam as it went on, since Sean and Hayes felt rather obligated to talk to everyone on the lines cause they're so nice. So while it wasn't so appealing to the new listener, it was at the tradeoff to include their loyal forum users.   I love the show but can't get into the forums there, mostly based on the interface, so I just haunt this sub for my discussion fix."
Earwolf,32kurt,Hafkie,4,Tue Apr 14 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"Same, I've really come around to this show but for some reason the Earwolf forums will not let me sign up to them, despite trying with various emails, facebook/twitter, all the ""sign up"" methods. Which is a shame, but oh well."
Earwolf,32kurt,temporarychair,6,Wed Apr 15 07:43:18 2015 UTC,"Is ""ehh wrong"" a recurring joke on HH? Seems like a couple people have used it."
Earwolf,32kurt,nohorseman,4,Wed Apr 15 02:58:49 2015 UTC,Yes its a segment where they read negative iTunes reviews or forum posts (including this sub once!) and tell the writer that they are actually the titular state of wrong
Earwolf,32kurt,NikoEstevan,11,Wed Apr 15 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't start this podcast until about 3-4 weeks ago, and I've been listening in order and am currently (as I type) listening to ep 32.  I haven't heard the ones you mention so I can't speak to those, but here's the ones I really like that I'd suggest to a new listener.  Ep 4 (Adam Pally): He plays the ""straight man"" to their insider-asshat characters and just flat calls them out a number of times.  It plays really well with this being their 4th ep total.  Ep 5: Gotta love some PFT  Ep 10 (Kyle Newacheck): The guest is the 4th workaholic and you can tell they all get along well (with S&H being writers on workaholics).  And him being a director he actually has the knowledge to speak intelligently and idiotically at the same time.  Ep 11 (Fogelnest): Also does a good job of playing along and heightening.  Never cared about him before this ep but now I'm considering his podcast.  Ep 25 (Aukerman & Ulrich): Definitely my fav and not just cause I like Scott a lot. The plot would be S&H are in contract negotations with the Earwolf heads (scott & ulrich) to continue the podcast.  Really funny and a lot of the humor comes from the ""lawyers"" representing various parties.  Also some of the best parts of any episode is when they go apeshit on the engineer, which happens often.  So I can't wait for the engineers ep."

Earwolf,32kurt,TheBlackSpank,4,Wed May 6 04:26:49 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite eps that I think capture the hilarity of Sean and Hayes:  Michael Showalter episode, not just for his segment, but for the beginning when Sean and Hayes discuss a scene from the Godfather in which Marlon Brando was incredibly difficult on set.  Brian Huskey reads his script for his new movie Teen Pope with the guys.  Shelby Fero's first appearance just consists of Sean and Hayes pretending to be younger than they are so they can be ""hip"".   The 2nd Paul F. Tompkins episode, where Paul tries to play Riddle Me This with them, and they refuse to understand the rules of the game.  Grace Helbig episode, where she tries to guide them on how to use a computer to access Youtube. They can't open the laptop, sign on to the desktop, or access the internet, and they insist on pouring water on the computer several times.  Paul Scheer and the guys read his script for ""So I Married A Van Helsing: Skellington's Kiss""  The more I listen to, the more it becomes my favorite podcast ever."
Earwolf,32kurt,SoberKeonClark,6,Wed Apr 15 01:40:37 2015 UTC,"Their ""characters"" are funny but it's more a proxy to make really funny observations about culture and attitudes (mostly pop culture)"
Earwolf,32kurt,JasmineForsythe,7,Wed Apr 15 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"The call-in episodes do run the risk of feeling a little exclusive. The eps you listed also might not be the best introduction to the show for a new listener. Start a little further back to get a better sense of the vibe.  Check any of these eps out:   Dave Thomas Sinbad Tracey Wigfield Grace Helbig   Those are my faves, they get super silly. Of course, not everything is for everyone and it might just not be your thing. Try 'em if you're interested, though."
Earwolf,32kurt,gs-fl-bi,4,Tue Apr 14 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions! Went back and currently listening to episode 1, so far I'm getting into this ep more than others.

Earwolf,32kurt,changry_perdvert,3,Tue Apr 14 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"Ehh Right was one of my favorite moments, if only for the humility it gave our boys.  The time they made up a Spider-Man story with BJ Novak and they were in such amazement about the most basic characteristics of Spider-Man.  When they had no listener questions for Lauren Lapkus and made the mistake of calling up an overly horny intern Andy.  All of the Dave Thomas episode. Never knew animation could be such a hazardous workplace!  All told - I really live for the every-so-often moments where Sean makes Hayes buss up and crack his whole shit up and laff his whole butt off. It's like PFT off-mic laughter in his infectiousness, but much more rare."
Earwolf,32kurt,CakeBoss16,24,Thu Apr 16 00:14:34 2015 UTC,"Ehhh wrong.  It IS as good as everyone talked it up to be and actually, it probably is a bit better.  What you seem to be missing is a fucking brain because anyone with a brain realizes that Sean and Hayes are smart, funny and nice and interesting.  But seriously, maybe listen to a few more starting from the beginning.  The Middleditch and listeners again episodes are Hollywood Handbook at its best though so maybe the show just isn't for you.  The PFT, David Wain, Rob Corddry, Aubrey Plaza, Lamorne Morris, Scott Aukerman, and Shelby Fero episodes are some of my favorites."

Earwolf,32kurt,Ciandotmov,5,Tue Apr 14 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"I completely agree on these points, guess I was expecting more laugh out loud stuff... or maybe those lol moments are there but it's just not something I can listen to as passively as CBB for example.   I feel like its a podcast where you need to start from the beginning, so you can watch their characters develop and see the inside jokes develop."
Earwolf,32kurt,JohnnyCarsonDaly,4,Wed Apr 15 00:44:23 2015 UTC,And by beginning I mean episode 1 of the reality SHOW show.
Earwolf,32kurt,Doesntgetredditatall,3,Wed Apr 15 07:26:26 2015 UTC,Tanks but no thanks.

Earwolf,32kurt,oshoney,3,Wed Apr 15 23:43:24 2015 UTC,I liked their listener shows more than the shows with guests. Just so much fun
Earwolf,32kurt,2x2hands-of-blue,8,Tue Apr 14 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"This show seems to be the most divisive podcast. I can't really understand why. It has the same ""alt comedy"" tone that a bunch of ""alt comedy"" shows have including CBB. HH just takes it to another layer/degree of feigned ignorance. I laugh out loud all the time with it (was just listening to the Paul Scheer episode and I couldn't help but laugh uncontrollably while on the street). What are people confused by?"
Earwolf,32kurt,CakeBoss16,13,Tue Apr 14 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"I'm listening to the first episode now, and their introductions of themselves and the conversation about Don Jon is pretty amazing. The line about teaching ""Rocky Gervais"" jokes got me more than anything I've heard on it yet.  I think I'm starting to realize the difference between this and other podcasts especially CBB. CBB has extremely outspoken, ridiculous characters and this serves as a cue when listening while doing something else. Allows you to train your focus away from the task at hand and to the podcast for the jokey times... Meanwhile on HH, the characters are the interviewers and perfectly normal in terms of accent and cadence, etc. meaning if you're trying to listen during anything more mindless than walking/running or driving/commuting you'll probably miss a ton of the jokes."
Earwolf,32kurt,Jeff-S,7,Tue Apr 14 17:56:43 2015 UTC,I think their rhythm just completely throws me off. I don't like their timing or just the way they talk. It's hard to explain. I don't know how to articulate what I don't like about them. But I just can't listen anymore.
Earwolf,32kurt,mrbananagrabber1,4,Tue Apr 14 17:59:03 2015 UTC,That's fair. I have the same thing with Kevin Pollak's show
Earwolf,32kurt,2x2hands-of-blue,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:25:33 2015 UTC,Ehh wrong! Their timing is perfect and you can't comprehend it because you don't have a fucking brain! /s
Earwolf,32kurt,mrbananagrabber1,0,Wed Apr 15 02:33:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kinda feel the same way.  It sounds too much like they are trying to be wacky or something with their tone of voice.  They are supposed to be playing foolish characters but I think it would work better if they played it a little straighter.  Saying something ridiculous with a straight face is usually funnier than saying something ridiculous and making a goofy face.  Their tone often feels like ""check out this crazy thing I'm about to say!"" and that gets tiring.  I do listen to the show occasionally but don't really think it is a top tier show."
Earwolf,32kurt,2x2hands-of-blue,3,Wed Apr 15 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it's unique.  The ""pretending to be more important than we are"" schtick has been beaten to death by this point.  I can never understand why people think it's so funny."
Earwolf,32kurt,SoberKeonClark,12,Tue Apr 14 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that they're pretending to be more important. At least that's not what I find so hilarious. It's their premises, off beat timing, and general feigned ignorance. They're also incredibly quick to turn down the oddest paths for their improv. That's what I find unique."
Earwolf,32kurt,mrbananagrabber1,-7,Tue Apr 14 22:43:07 2015 UTC,Literally the whole bit is they're pretending to be important Hollywood insiders...
Earwolf,32kurt,SoberKeonClark,11,Wed Apr 15 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Except if you actually listen to the show, you'd see that given their personalities, it would be funny regardless of them being Hollywood insiders. It's almost irrelevant."
Earwolf,32kurt,86themayo,7,Wed Apr 15 00:56:18 2015 UTC,That isn't even remotely true.
Earwolf,32kurt,DanzigMeowMeow,-1,Wed Apr 15 02:34:31 2015 UTC,Can you tell me why you think that?  I've listened to many episodes and that's the exact premise.
Earwolf,32kurt,mrbananagrabber1,8,Wed Apr 15 03:04:33 2015 UTC,"It's the premise, but it's not like it's the focus of the humor at all and the show is hardly repetitive. Mostly the premise just a catalyst to make fun of dumb things in an ironic way like shitty movie trailers, nerd culture, people asking what Kim Kardashian does, faux-intellectualism, etc. It just happens that they mostly make fun of pop culture.  I mean they were basically doing the same thing on their Reality Show Show podcast and they weren't even playing characters. It's just their tone. Acting like the show is limited because of the premise is ridiculous, even if you don't like it. The whole ""pretending to be famous"" thing is barely part of the show."
Earwolf,32kurt,DanzigMeowMeow,6,Wed Apr 15 04:15:20 2015 UTC,That's like saying the premise of Kristen Wiig's Target Lady character is that she's pretending to be a lady that works at Target.
Earwolf,32kurt,nohorseman,2,Wed Apr 15 05:10:29 2015 UTC,But what's wrong with sticking to one premise/bit in comedy?
Earwolf,32kurt,nohorseman,-3,Wed Apr 15 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"Because it gets stale incredibly quickly, not to mention the fact that it has been done many, many times over outside of HH."

While that one makes me laugh so much more, I think I prefer this one because PFT seems to have more fun and interplay with Andy Daly. The Whitman episode is amazing but like many Adomian characters he dominates the entire time."

Earwolf,32je3w,gs-fl-bi,3,Wed Apr 15 02:07:10 2015 UTC,I would also throw the John Hodgman as Ayn Rand episode up there. The sheer energy Andy brought to this episode was similar to Hodgman's version of Ayn Rand with intense contempt for the world.
Earwolf,32je3w,WeeBabySeamus,4,Thu Apr 16 08:46:15 2015 UTC,"I love the Whitman episode. If you know Whitman well, you know James crushed it."

Earwolf,32je3w,stenchwinslow,5,Tue Apr 14 14:15:21 2015 UTC,"I could have listened to Andy read from L. Ron's memoir for ages! The choice of excerpt was what made it funny, which I really appreciate. The delivery helped, but it wasn't the focal point like most readings of excerpts on the DAP. Great closer: ""There are no snakes at the bottom of your bed""."
Earwolf,32je3w,potatohead3,3,Wed Apr 15 04:24:11 2015 UTC,"Wait.  Was that really an actual passage from Hubbards ""memoir?"""

Earwolf,32je3w,gingerbear,5,Wed Apr 15 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"Affirmations (L. Ron Hubbard):       The ""Affirmations"" (also referred to as the ""Admissions"") are a work said to have been written by L. Ron Hubbard in the late 1940s, a few years before he established Dianetics (1950) or Scientology (1952). They consist of a series of statements by and addressed to Hubbard, relating to various physical, sexual, psychological and social issues that he was encountering in his life. After the Affirmations became public knowledge in 1984 the Church of Scientology has disputed their authenticity, though in legal papers it has described the Affirmations as having been ""written by"" Hubbard and sought to retain ownership of them. The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis with the intention of resolving the author's psychological problems and instilling a positive mental attitude. They are closely linked to the occult philosophy of Thelema, devised by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, in which Hubbard participated for a while during 1945–46. In her book Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion, Janet Reitman calls the Affirmations ""the most revealing psychological self-assessment, complete with exhortations to himself, that [Hubbard] had ever made.""

Earwolf,32jdvz,Saadnation,7,Wed Apr 15 00:48:00 2015 UTC,They are on the individual episode pages.  If you click the link that is usually posted for the reddit threads (like this one) it will take you to the page with the pics.  They are at the bottom.
Earwolf,32jdvz,JohnnyCarsonDaly,4,Wed Apr 15 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like an idiot haha, I've been going to the show section on earwolf, never noticed each episode had its own page."

Earwolf,32jdvz,nohorseman,11,Tue Apr 14 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'd say bounce around until you're firmly cemented as into it, then start from 1 and go through all of them.   There are the ones most people point to as their faves: Paul Scheer, Sinbad, Aukerman & Ulrich, Shelby Fero I, Iliza Shlesinger, Dave Thomas.   Kind of strangely, I wouldn't recommend the Earwolf Favorites PFT, Lapkus, and Gourley right out of the gate, as they're good but not classics. People that were on Reality Show Show a bunch and/or are writer buddies of Sean and Hayes (aka people you probably haven't heard of much) have guest segments that are better than these.  This thread has a few mildly off-kilter recommendations too with specific bits singled out. Plus /u/Zsinjeh bought the dang pro version so he is a true Handbook Head.   Doing the Pauly Shore ep followed by the Jarrad Paul would also be a nice afternoon of listening once your feet (or maybe I should say ears) are more wet, get to hear /r/Earwolf 's golden boy /u/Slayner 's roasting."

Earwolf,32hd1w,evilweevil666,3,Mon Apr 13 21:04:57 2015 UTC,"At the time I made the bracket, I hadn't heard Two Thumbs since the day it was released. I forgot what the episode even had in it, but I figured because it was in the Best of 2013, people liked it.   A few weeks ago, after seeing how many votes it was getting, I decided to listen to it again, and it had two of my favorite bits in CBB history in it (Grown Up 3 directed by Werner Herzog, and ""Where's the beef"") I just forgot about them! I'd absolutely put it further into the bracket if I were to update it."

Earwolf,32f2ab,GeorgeTaylorG,2,Tue Apr 14 05:33:37 2015 UTC,exactly what I thought listening to it.
Earwolf,32f2ab,istartriots,22,Tue Apr 14 20:38:39 2015 UTC,I really felt like this was a weak episode.  I love Paul Brittain but it just felt like nothing was landing.  Kyle was a good first timer though.  Maybe I was just expecting something on the level of The Calvin's Twins.
Earwolf,32f2ab,House_Of_Pies,13,Mon Apr 13 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a really great premise, but every time a scenario or twist was thrown up, they seemed to just shut it down to play the situation straight, which sort of meandered into nowhere. Shame, because it had some really funny moments!"
Earwolf,32f2ab,UltimoLJ,4,Mon Apr 13 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"That's a perfect obvservation.  It felt like it was often on the cusp of something very funny, but then fizzled out."
Earwolf,32f2ab,House_Of_Pies,5,Mon Apr 13 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this episode just never hit the rails for me. It's kind of painful to listen to them just flailing with a premise that just isn't working. Hate to be harsh but it was one of the least entertaining episodes in a long time."
Earwolf,32f2ab,temporarychair,2,Tue Apr 14 04:17:40 2015 UTC,"They have had a string of GOAT(greatest of all time) episodes lately, this one just crashed hard in comparison. It wasn't THAT bad, but seems a lot worse than we've been getting lately."
Earwolf,32f2ab,Pluppets,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:02:32 2015 UTC,"I agree it's a minor stumble compared to some of the absolutely awesome episodes that have come out lately. Still love the show, but they can't all be winners. Listening to it I knew it would be titled ""Shifting Bouncy"" because it was literally the only amusing line from the ep."
Earwolf,32f2ab,temporarychair,9,Tue Apr 14 23:09:17 2015 UTC,I could not disagree more.
Earwolf,32f2ab,gerryblog,5,Mon Apr 13 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yup I adored it! Everyone was so game and I loved the narrative. I think nearly everything landed, the gang was howling. I mean who are these guys, Roman dang Sklar!?   Kyle is a Patton Oswalt, near Zouks level interacting-with-characters guest. The damn Jingle slayed me.   I thought Steve was going to end up being Dan's real dad based off their shared classic horseshoes, you know, that old phrase."

Earwolf,32f2ab,Mr_Viper,3,Wed Apr 15 20:03:35 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it! It started off a little slow but it picked up towards the end. There weren't as many laugh out loud moments as there normally are but it was still pretty funny.
Earwolf,32f2ab,catch_th3m_all,4,Tue Apr 14 19:45:00 2015 UTC,Yay Paul Brittan is back! Boo it's not with Taran Killam.
Earwolf,32f2ab,oshoney,6,Mon Apr 13 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"Paul Brittain was tied to too many characters that had too few differences between them that led the whole thing into a muddy, unfunny mess."
Earwolf,32f2ab,temporarychair,2,Tue Apr 14 04:19:33 2015 UTC,"I thought this episode was really great. I chortled at the Happy Days part and Scott doing the math on how his brother died (3 foot trampoline, 8 foot ceilings, average height man 5'10"") was really funny. I like these smaller cast episodes because they can really flesh out one weird character."
Earwolf,32e7n7,chicknsandwich,8,Mon Apr 13 01:42:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for putting it up! It's really intimidating calling in. There's a delay on the phone that makes it really hard to be natural, and when you're hearing their end it sounds like it takes me a full second to say anything. For example, I wasn't trying to say ""yes"" to the beard scanner. But my boss really does have a beard. Mostly I tried not to make any jokes but I kind of wish I played it even straighter than I did. Also I was trying to laugh off-mic, but it was so hard. Those guys are crazy funny.  Really wishing they asked me to sing my song though. Also wish we could have gotten more in-depth with the Patriots talk. Think I could have impressed the guys with my sports knowledge."

Earwolf,32by7r,nicemaker,38,Sun Apr 12 13:52:46 2015 UTC,"Bjork singing little drummer boy on the newest Christmas show was so hilarious, but pretty much every appearance by him is consistently great."
Earwolf,32by7r,chicknsandwich,7,Sun Apr 12 14:04:13 2015 UTC,"Just last night, I re-listened to the Travel Bug episode of ADPPP, where Besser played the pope. So fucking funny. I agree, he is consistently great. Always has a few surprises up his sleeve.  I recommend anyone who's into Matt's podcast appearances should check out his album ""May I Help You (Dumbass)?"" (For a dollar more, you can get a physical copy at the UCB store.)  It's basically a collection of wrong number calls. People call him, he answers and fucks with them. I love it."
Earwolf,32by7r,Condawg,29,Mon Apr 13 03:10:29 2015 UTC,Matt Besser is so stupidly underrated. We always talk about PFT characters or Andy daly characters or even Lauren Lapkus characters but Matt Besser comes up some incredible ones himself. I wish he would shoe up on CBB more often.   Every time I listen to Improv4humans (actually listening to random old episodes right now while cleaning my apartment) I just get blown away that he stays consistently great through 5-10 scenes every single god damn week.   It's just mind boggling to me. That's a lot of improv. But when you Co founded the Ucb and teach it for a living I guess it's just second nature.   And talking more About I4H It's by far the easiest podcast to just jump into and listen to. Very user friendly so to speak.   I think Matt can be a bit of an asshole with his political views but that's part of the charm of listening to him. How heated he gets over what he believes in.
Earwolf,32by7r,Slayner,12,Sun Apr 12 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"He's remarkably good at leading/directing improv scenes. Look at I4H's Atlantis scene, he turns it from a funny, Godfather-esque scene into something completely different."
Earwolf,32by7r,No_name_Johnson,7,Sun Apr 12 18:06:14 2015 UTC,Are you saying you think he's underrated in general or in the earwolf listener community. I think he should be 100 times more famous than he is.
Earwolf,32by7r,natiice,8,Sun Apr 12 18:25:36 2015 UTC,A little of both. Obviously the earwolf community knows and appreciates him but with how good he is be should be recognized with PFT daly and Lapkus which I don't think he is.   He absolutely should be way way way more famous then he is though
Earwolf,32by7r,Slayner,9,Sun Apr 12 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that Besser deserves to be more famous, but a cool thing about him is, every single time I've seen ASSSSCAT, he just walks into the theater past every single person waiting in line to see him.   It's pretty cool; I'm almost certain the people in line know who he is, but they don't bother him. It's just this symbiotic relationship where we can see this amazing improviser up close, and in return we don't bother him.   If he were more famous, like Amy Poehler famous, there's no way that could happen. I just think it's the ideal level of fame where you have a relatively small but dedicated bunch of fans who appreciate you, but you aren't constantly surrounded by cameras."
Earwolf,32by7r,credibit,2,Sun Apr 12 21:36:56 2015 UTC,I love him as Bjork.
Earwolf,32by7r,pdxsean,18,Mon Apr 13 20:38:40 2015 UTC,"It's probably difficult to overstate how much the UCB has affected the comedy scene that we're all fans of. How many of our favorite improvisors studied at UCB and how many of them, along with standups, cut their teeth on UCB stages?"
Earwolf,32by7r,jwalterleavesnotes,5,Sun Apr 12 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"So true, once you start seeing who the writers are for your favorite shows, there's a lot of connections back to UCB. Parks and Rec of course was loaded with UCB talent, as is CBB, but they are out there everywhere. As a co-founder, Matt has played a significant role in making the path of their fame easier. Despite all his bluster and opinion, it's pretty neat that he can sit back and not brag about it, or grouse about his relative lack of fame."
Earwolf,32by7r,oshoney,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"I love when on his show, his co-hosts like all tell a caller or something ""this guy is the father of modern improv"" and he just laughs it off"
Earwolf,32by7r,TheBlackSpank,13,Tue Apr 14 21:29:33 2015 UTC,"I'm reading Amy Poehler's book right now and there's some good stuff in there about him. Like for one I did not realize that those two dated for a long time around their move from Chicago to NYC. The fact that they handled themselves so well and stayed in the same group after the breakup is great.   As far as Earwolf goes, i4h is the podcast I look forward to the most other than CBB. The highs are so so high and it's so consistently good regardless of the other people involved or the scenes they do. It's basically a master class in improv every week. I wish I could do what they do."
Earwolf,32by7r,GoatseMcShitbungle,3,Sun Apr 12 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"Always wondered if any of the three guys ever dated Amy. Whenever it gets asked, they usually joke and just say that Ian dated Walsh for a while."
Earwolf,32by7r,wardypants,11,Sun Apr 12 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"I always love when he slips in his ""guy shouting something from farther away"" voice in the middle of a scene - usually catches the other improvisers off guard."
Earwolf,32by7r,DanzigMeowMeow,10,Sun Apr 12 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"My absolute favorite Besser moment was when he did his Morrisey impression as Smaug the dragon.  Makes me laugh every time.  ""For once in my liiiiiiiiife, let meeee, get what I want!   ....Hobbit blood...."""
Earwolf,32by7r,MysticBounce,2,Sun Apr 12 15:45:59 2015 UTC,My current favorite Besser moment has to be just him laughing off mic at Gabrus' filthy riffed punchline in OkStupid Ep #165. Good ep!

Earwolf,32by7r,jonathandoublel,4,Sun Apr 12 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"I have mad respect for Besser and his dedication to improv. He hosts improv4humans really well and creates consistently funny scenes, his ""man in the crowd"" character keeps cracking me whenever he pops in. He's lived and breathed improv for however many years and will probably keep improving at his improv.   His hard laugh kinda weirds me out though, but not in a bad way."
Earwolf,32by7r,pdxsean,4,Sun Apr 12 17:12:07 2015 UTC,I really really hope he does Lapkus' show soon. They have really good improv chemistry and i think they would do a great job.
Earwolf,32by7r,sm33,3,Sun Apr 12 22:43:43 2015 UTC,"Every time I see him pop up in a supporting role on TV I get way more excited than I probably should. Most recently: Big Time in Hollywood, FL (on Comedy Central)."
Earwolf,32by7r,splice_of_life,5,Sun Apr 12 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"Matt's probably my favorite comedian now that Harris is no longer in the running. Much like Scott, it's really great to see him as a guest on a show other than his own. He's a real pro and doesn't walk over the other guests when they jump in with a joke. On his Getting Doug With High Live appearance, he got the biggest laugh of the night but was pretty content to hang back and let the other louder people say more.  But yeah his retired pope character is hard to beat."
Earwolf,32by7r,CrouchJr,4,Sun Apr 12 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"Matt does ASSSSCAT at UCB LA just about every week, and you can tell he still has a lot of fun doing it. He's not as flashy or fast as some other improvisers, so you don't hear about him as often as you hear about others, but he is a consistently hilarious improviser. So thankful that he and the other founders decided to form a theater - we have so much comedy today in large part because of them!"
Earwolf,32by7r,lemon_sherbet_trip,4,Sun Apr 12 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"In addition to his status as a comedy icon, and the UCB Improv Comedy Manual, and the fact that the UCB is really what got the ball rolling on Earwolf in general and every comic I know and love today, one of the things I respect most about Besser is how he keeps a scene together.  When listening to I4H, keep an eye on his initiations and his transitions.  Each of them makes absolute sense in the scene, yet at the same time, it's stuff that better and on a different level than anything I could have come up with.  Also, look at how he uses the talent he has on the show that week.  it's kind of like watching a master painter at work, except he's painting with people.  Case in point: the recent episode where he cuts to the Woody Allen Starbucks.  Holy shit.  Honorable mention:  Bjork, from the 2014 Xmas show. Honorable mention: The Lumberhack Honorable mention: ADPPP - The Travel Bug with August Lindt"

I love a good Besser rant and respect his conviction. I find his jaded attitude (like crapping on the success of short form) adds to the realism and I love hearing about past UCB stories like the recent episode with PFT. I am so thankful that IFH has exposed me to so many talented improvisers.
Earwolf,32by7r,GiantDeviantPiano,2,Sun Apr 12 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"His performance as Pope Benedict XVI in ""The Travel Bug"" was amazing.  To put it into perspective, he was the standout in an episode that contained Werner Herzog and H.R. Giger."
Earwolf,32by7r,siriusthinking,2,Mon Apr 13 03:58:21 2015 UTC,"Besser is an absolute legend. I finally listened to the Eric the intern episode of improv4humans and it's one of my favourite hours of entertainment ever. He's super passionate about what he does and this passion is evident in the constant stream of hilarious stuff her puts out. Woo Pig Sooie ous great and costs less than a cup of coffee. Over and above his own work, he's influenced so many other comedians I love, it's ridiculous how much talent had emerged from the ucb system."

Earwolf,32ahn2,FugitiveDribbling,3,Sun Apr 12 01:50:50 2015 UTC,"If they do, I hope it's more grounded.  I think the greatness of the series rests on the interactions of ALW, Scott, and Fourvel as themselves.  Complicated identities and nonsensical time travel lose their novelty pretty quick when that's all that happens.  Similarly, I also like the simplicity of the early Wompler episodes, when she was like Gino is today, just a hilarious intern throwing on the cans."
Earwolf,32ahn2,macrowive,4,Sun Apr 12 05:44:01 2015 UTC,I say they should do a spiritual sequel and start a new series of episodes. Same people involved but new/different characters and a new story.

But really I'm just lucky. I can fly out to cool things like this since I work at the airport, and in SNL's case I just happen to have a mother who went to high school with one of the writers. It's an awesome connection to have."

Other than the perk of free flying how's working at an airport? I wouldn't mind applying myself but I've always pictured the work as being agonizing"
Earwolf,32895o,Emleaux,2,Sat Apr 11 19:18:42 2015 UTC,"It's really not to bad. I mean if you're ok with some physical labor and working outside in whatever weather, it's totally worth it. Even if I got a real job I'd probably try to stay there part time just for the benefits.   You do have to do some heavy lifting, and sometimes stay out there hours at a time, but at least where I am, when there's not a plane on the ground that you're actively working on, you can just chill in the break room. Sometimes we'll get random two hour breaks. It gives me time to listen to podcasts or read books or play my 3DS. Being outside when it's super cold or super hot or rainy it suxxxxxx, but overall it's really not that bad. Especially at smaller airports with less flights."
Earwolf,32895o,CrouchJr,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:02:18 2015 UTC,"Well I already work outdoors and do some heavy lifting year round so none of that sounds too bad. The only thing I would hate about having any other job then what I have now is I can listen to podcasts all day everyday, but in order to get a real job that'll probably just be something I have to give up eventually."
Earwolf,32895o,Emleaux,6,Sat Apr 11 20:06:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a week or two late, but holy hell that CBB with Middleditch, Kumail and Martin Starr is funny. I honestly believe Middleditch does the best Harry Caray vocal impression I have ever heard. Will Ferrel can dress up and look like the guy, down to his head bobbing and pursed lips, but Middleditch sounds like Caray to a disturbingly accurate extent.  This week's episodes of both Professor Blastoff and Who Charted are some of the worst they have ever done. That was unfortunate, but these things happen. Another podcast I love, The Crabfeast, is also having a streak of bad episodes.   I've been thinking why they were so bad, and it's because the guests were so unrelatable. The hosts of either podcast tried so hard - especially Tig, Kyle and David - to make their guests seem decent and/or funny. Someone like Ross Jeffries, though - that guy is just an outright ass. Kitty wasn't too terrible, but that's not Whooch's bread and butter - white female rappers. They do so damn well with comedians and actors as guests, but I guess you gotta switch it up every once in a while.  Never Not Funny, on the other hand, remains consistent and always enjoyable. In the midst of some stinkers from other Earwolf podcasts, I can always fall back on Jimmy and Matt."
Earwolf,32895o,CrouchJr,3,Sat Apr 11 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"The more I listen to NNF, the more I love it.  Guests I don't expect to be great, turn out to fit in to the show extremely well.   It has so many moments of very very micro suspense, like when they bet on something, or have Garon look something up in the background and come back to it later.... such a charming show, every time."
Earwolf,32895o,Emleaux,2,Sat Apr 11 16:14:52 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right about the guests part. They will bring in musicians from time to time as a guest and I don't at all expect them to be funny, but Matt and Jimmy always end up making them look hilarious. It's just the nature of that show. They've been at it for over 500 episodes - they have that show down to a science now and I enjoy every minute of it."

Earwolf,32895o,oshoney,2,Sun Apr 12 04:55:34 2015 UTC,Free talk Saturday all I want to talk about is Daredevil edition.    (3 eps in) are you all watching this?
Earwolf,32895o,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,2,Sat Apr 11 13:58:04 2015 UTC,Daredevil the TV show? Didn't even hear about it until now. I'm assuming you like it though huh?
Earwolf,32895o,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,2,Sat Apr 11 13:58:43 2015 UTC,It's the first of five Netflix series set in the Marvel movie universe and it's amazing. Super dark and violent and crazy.
Earwolf,32895o,Condawg,2,Sat Apr 11 14:06:36 2015 UTC,Would you still recommend it for someone who isn't too crazy about superhero movies?   It's not that I hate them I just find them repetitive.
Earwolf,32895o,SquidWithBatWings,2,Sat Apr 11 14:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's unlike pretty much every superhero movie/tv show I've seen. It's much more grounded and realistic than say a Thor or Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It only requires a very small understanding of the Marvel universe to get everything, like you just have to know that during the Avengers New York was a war zone because it has a small effect on Daredevil."
Earwolf,32895o,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:12:12 2015 UTC,Yeah that's fine I know the marvel universe okay just got burnt out of the genre but I'll have to check it out daredevil was always one of the cooler marvel characters IMO

Earwolf,326mio,MysticBounce,7,Wed Apr 15 00:19:22 2015 UTC,"Sinbad and Dave Thomas got me hooked. The Ronald Reagan riff they go on in the Sinbad episode is possibly my favorite HH moment. It's brilliant how well he fit in on the show.  I love the Iliza schlesinger episode. I think the show does better with unconventional Earwolf guests. If the guest is not completely in on the joke but still knows how to play along, then HH kills it. Iliza antagonizes Sean and Hayes and in turn they get more and more obtuse with their material.   I think the polar opposite is CBB in recent years. New guests often don't fit in at all past the interview stage.  HH thrives on it."
Earwolf,326mio,klobbermang,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:05:56 2015 UTC,"You sound like two Dutch guys who are just figuring things out.  Those episodes you mention are the two general styles of the guest. the Sinbad/Dave Thomas type who immediately go with the flow and talk about made up insane hollywood stuff. The other is the Iliza type, and like the Kumail type who are sorta combative and not really going with the premise, but it's funny because of the combativeness. I think I like the latter better."
Earwolf,326mio,changry_perdvert,5,Mon Apr 13 17:54:40 2015 UTC,There are no bad episodes.  Listen to a few with guests you know to get used Sean and Hayes' humor if you want then just start from the beginning.

Earwolf,326mio,SirRibShack,2,Sat Apr 11 21:00:34 2015 UTC,Not the best episode but IMO the best moment/bit is the first By Grove I've Got It: You're Doing it Wrong. The whole Abe Lincoln thing just makes me laugh my little butt off every time.  Edit: It's the Alex Borstein episode.

The fact that Scott is so close with Posehn would give a lot of connections to the comic world if needed. Gerry Duggan isn't on Nerd Poker anymore, but I have to assume he'd be willing to come and do a podcast to talk about comics. Rick Remender is also someone who could be a fun guest.   I asked Scott about it on one of his AMA's a long time ago and he said he had thought about it and it was a possibility in the future.   Basically, I think there really would be a place for a comics-centric podcast on Earwolf."

I was surprised the two dudes actually had some knowledge about the league (knowing the playoffs went from 5 to 7 games in the first round, etc), and I love how it contrasted how little LL knows (but I was happy she at least knows Hakeem the Dream).   The ""what are they now"" segment was so damn funny. Also loved all the old role player references - Pooh Richardson, Otis Thorpe, Clarence Witherspoon, Jack Haley, Dee Brown, etc. I also laughed out loud on an airplane at the sweatshirt thing (where they were guessing what it was - irony, coincidence, chalice, chair, etc).

Earwolf,323hzy,GeorgeTaylorG,4,Fri Apr 10 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"Ha ha. Honest.  As Kulap says in the Two Charted after the Steve-O ep, Howard seems to share a strange bond/familiarity with him.  I like the ep because it's like Howard getting the chance to talk to 'alternate dimension Howard'... He gets to meet the him that he would have turned out to be, if he 'wasn't smart'. Know what I mean?  [But yeah, I won't be disappointed if he never shows up as a guest again!]"
Earwolf,323hzy,patrickthewhite1,6,Fri Apr 10 21:41:34 2015 UTC,"even the Nova one   damn, you are a true fan."
Earwolf,323hzy,oshoney,7,Fri Apr 10 08:03:39 2015 UTC,I loved the nova one. She seemed cool.
Earwolf,323hzy,patrickthewhite1,5,Fri Apr 10 14:22:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, I like Nova. I just said that because I know it's a thing on here.  I own all her music, and almost feel invested in her as I 'got up on her' so early thanks to Jensen's pod [Get Up On This].  Her appearance on Who Charted just confuses me though. Like, they're all friends in real life. And they've worked together. And she's charming and funny in her appearances elsewhere. It's just like she forgets that she doesn't have to be 'in character' for Who Charted. Just creates a weird tone.  [I said ""just"" way too many times there. Sorry.]"
Earwolf,323hzy,GeorgeTaylorG,3,Fri Apr 10 21:37:39 2015 UTC,What's the Nova one? I'm pretty new to Whooch.
Earwolf,323hzy,dracomik,4,Fri Apr 10 11:48:00 2015 UTC,It's the nova rockafeller episode. I just learned that people on this sub don't like it.
Earwolf,323hzy,FriVault,3,Fri Apr 10 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"I'm partially joking, but I definitely cringed more during that episode than any other Whooch.   I can't remember the specifics, but the Earwolf boards summed up my feeling on that episode pretty well."
Earwolf,323hzy,JasmineForsythe,3,Fri Apr 10 17:06:06 2015 UTC,Does it get better?
Earwolf,323hzy,JasmineForsythe,3,Fri Apr 10 08:32:55 2015 UTC,"I'm in work. The office started filling up with people [it was 08:10 when I posted that] so I switched from the video over to listening to today's new Two Charted.  Will I go back to the video later... to be honest, I'm not sure. It was ROUGH."
Earwolf,323g80,kazenzai,7,Fri Apr 10 07:05:45 2015 UTC,"I said to him ""Hey Harris, I miss you buddy"" he said something but I didn't hear anything.    Those were probably the secrets of the universe."
Earwolf,323g80,pm_me_ur_garmonbozia,4,Fri Apr 10 13:53:45 2015 UTC,I had a dream once where I was sitting in on an episode of UTU2TM. At the end of the episode Scott (aukerman) suprised (adam) Scott by bringing in the every member of U2 one by one. Adam Scotts reaction made me laugh so hard that I litterally woke up while laughing. Good times.

Earwolf,323g80,turnk,3,Fri Apr 10 19:22:59 2015 UTC,I had a dream once where Paul F. Tompkins and I would call each other at the end of every day and just talk about what we did that day.
Earwolf,323g80,temporarychair,2,Sat Apr 11 02:50:27 2015 UTC,I had a dream where I met Adam Scott. He was nice at first but you could tell he was just sort of a polite dick. Then we rode horses through a snowy valley and Adam said he was going ahead to fix a fire. I knew he'd be waiting for me. Then I woke up.

Earwolf,323dw8,angelfromthecoast,4,Fri Apr 10 06:38:53 2015 UTC,I would be personally offended if Scott didn't appear on TLLS sometime soon after Corden stole his friend. And also for Corden/Reggie to be on the podcast.
Earwolf,323dw8,Prax150,2,Fri Apr 10 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"How's Corden been received over there in the good ol' United States of America? Over here in the UK people seem to either love or hate him, but maybe it's just me, but for me he's somewhere in the middle."

Earwolf,320pzc,CakeBoss16,2,Thu Apr 9 20:59:16 2015 UTC,The tour bus episode where Tim played David Lee Roth and Mike Love was amazing.
Earwolf,31zo6o,oshoney,8,Thu Apr 9 12:24:50 2015 UTC,"I just finished listening, and it's great.  I became a fan of both Rich and Ty through their appearances on Never Not Funny, so I loved this episode."
Earwolf,31zo6o,adamav,5,Thu Apr 9 14:29:09 2015 UTC,Rich is really fun on Doug Loves Movies too.
Earwolf,31zo6o,thelostdolphin,3,Thu Apr 9 14:56:53 2015 UTC,I love how intense he gets but also how terrible he is at the game.
Earwolf,31zo6o,klobbermang,3,Thu Apr 9 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"Haha. It makes sense why he's doing a podcast about board games. He clearly likes the competition element of it. If anything, he probably gets super frustrated playing the LMG because he's normally good at games like that. It would be like Samm the Ma'am playing another type of game and getting pissed because he's normally a genius at the LMG."
Earwolf,31zo6o,thelostdolphin,2,Thu Apr 9 17:17:50 2015 UTC,His run at his first appearance (12 Guests of Christmas 2013) gave him the confidence that he can go far in the games. Even eliminated Samm the Ma'am himself. But his subsequent guestings he became worse.
Earwolf,31zo6o,herrdunphy,2,Thu Apr 9 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"This was really great and I look forward to hearing who else he gets. Anyone else feel this was a bit ad heavy for a first ep, though? Seemed like nearly half the episode was selling something."
Earwolf,31zo6o,Kurisonu,4,Thu Apr 9 23:44:31 2015 UTC,I love board games guys. Very excited to listen to this.
Earwolf,31zo6o,1slinkydink1,3,Thu Apr 9 15:59:38 2015 UTC,"Great first episode, IMO.  I'm hooked already."
Earwolf,31zo6o,justincorrect,2,Thu Apr 9 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"I like that there's both a wide variety of segments Rich employed and a theme running throughout! It seems very thought out, the kind of stuff borne from day dreams."
Earwolf,31zo6o,potatohead3,2,Fri Apr 10 04:13:22 2015 UTC,I guess a board games podcast hosted by Rich Sommer is not a bad idea? Anyone listen to this yet?
Earwolf,31zo6o,Prax150,3,Thu Apr 9 14:04:43 2015 UTC,It's strange that this exists.
Earwolf,31zo6o,vladimirscootin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"So I like Rich Sommer, I think he's an interesting and funny guy. It sorta seems weird though that all of a sudden he started appearing on the Earwolf/Douglovesmmovies/Nerdist podcasts and became part of the scene. Why did it happen with him and not some other actor on a drama? Is that something he was going for? I guess I just don't get hollywood."
Earwolf,31zo6o,klobbermang,6,Thu Apr 9 17:17:33 2015 UTC,Pretty sure comedy is his background or at least part of it. He did have a minor reoccurring role on The Office.   But the real answer is probably just that he is friends with the right people.
Earwolf,31zo6o,Michael__Pemulis,7,Thu Apr 9 19:39:37 2015 UTC,He did improv in Minnesota while he was at university. And probably didn't hurt to know Jon Hamm.
Earwolf,31zo6o,OblongIgloo,5,Thu Apr 9 20:42:43 2015 UTC,He was part of the UCB scene before he got cast on Mad Men
Earwolf,31zo6o,Memphish_Boognish,4,Thu Apr 9 23:16:50 2015 UTC,He's a UCB alum
Earwolf,31zo6o,Memphish_Boognish,3,Thu Apr 9 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"Well I would shmooze with comedy bigs too if I could, so more power to him I guess."
Earwolf,31zo6o,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Thu Apr 9 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"I think he started appearing on comedy podcasts because he wanted to. If like Kevin Spacey or even fucking Aaron Paul decided they really wanted to be on these podcasts and they were really fun guests with a lot of energy like Rich I'm sure they could easily become ""part of the scene."""
Earwolf,31zo6o,catocatocato,2,Fri Apr 10 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"He appeared on The Chris Gethard Show months and months ago. I don't know, this question seems odd? Sometimes you meet new people?"
Earwolf,31zo6o,spinney,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:41:39 2015 UTC,Yesterday I listened to him on the Nerdist podcast waaaaay back on episode ~30 and he talks about his improv and comedy background. I wondered the same thing. I thought maybe it was through Jon Hamm that he ended up on DLM once in a while but that wasn't the case

Earwolf,31zsha,gs-fl-bi,3,Thu Apr 9 14:02:22 2015 UTC,I genuinely liked the David Bazan episode. Although that ep. is top 3 in terms of GOAT I4H.
Earwolf,31zsha,No_name_Johnson,5,Thu Apr 9 19:32:33 2015 UTC,"They had a rapper Open Mic Eagle doing a song on a live show and it, too, was kind of the pits. But they didn't improvise off of it. I've resigned myself to bad rants and music on this show that I'm going to have to skip past."
Earwolf,31zsha,nohorseman,3,Thu Apr 9 14:11:08 2015 UTC,"Open Mike Eagle is really good and steps outside of the conventional hip hop bounds. I'll have to listen to that episode to see if he did anything different to make it the pits. That being said, yeah the bands that come on the show are mostly really fucking boring."
Earwolf,31zsha,RadioRaheem_,3,Thu Apr 9 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"Ah I see! It could just have been that he was brought out to do a single song at a comedy room and just didn't sound that good. It was 169 LIVE Xmas Special; Horatio Sanz, John Gemberling, Matt Walsh, Open Mike Eagle. I remember not liking it that much but it's all I've ever heard of him.  Edit: I went back and listened to it (~44 mins in that ep) and he's kind of got a Chance / Bronson semi-grating singing voice thing going on that because it's mixed badly live and is only one song didn't go over that well for me. I was almost certainly too hard on him cause the beat is cool  now that I listen to it again, and it's absolutely way more interesting than dorky MySpace guitar folk"
Earwolf,31zsha,nohorseman,4,Thu Apr 9 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"I still haven't listened to the episode so there's the chance that I could listen to it and see that he was maybe off his game or something, but yeah it probably was the mixing like you said. Not that I'm the guy who gets to pass final judgement on him or performances or really anything for that matter, I just can't really speak on it because I haven't listened to it but I know that he's usually really good. You should really listen to his album Dark Comedy. It's really good, and all the beats are really interesting and there's even a song with Hannibal which is really fucking funny."
Earwolf,31zsha,RadioRaheem_,3,Thu Apr 9 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've tried to be really openminded about it, but it just doesn't add anything to the show. I was so excited to see Wenger,Holland, Huskey, then two minutes in when I realized it was a ""music"" episode I was like what the fuck."
Earwolf,31zsha,jarluch,9,Thu Apr 9 14:09:40 2015 UTC,Or just keep on doing their free podcasts however they like

Earwolf,31z1v6,klobbermang,6,Thu Apr 9 17:13:53 2015 UTC,I can't really blame her though. It's gotta be daunting being on the show without having a comedy/improv background.

Earwolf,31z1v6,kmingle,26,Thu Apr 9 15:01:18 2015 UTC,"It's a very funny show where two guys are constantly in character as Hollywood blowhards, satirizing overly-self-important podcasts. That's the basic premise, anyway, but it's a lot more than that. It has rocketed into my top 2 shows ever since their appearance on WSGLL earlier this year.   A common experience is having difficulty getting into it, but then it suddenly ""clicks"" and you're head over heels with it. Kind of like how very continuity-heavy CBBs win the best ofs, people like feeling ""in."" On the surface it might just seem like a couple of guys messing up subject-verb agreement then laughing off mic at it, but it is actually very funny and very smart, and the show is funny smart cool guys being nice.

Earwolf,31z1v6,spinney,16,Thu Apr 9 15:02:35 2015 UTC,"Probs not.  Between the references to the Silicon Valley podcast, Tiny's addition to the plug, and Scott mentioning that Deadline article that no one wanted to get into, this is most likely recorded after Harris's passing.  Nice to hear some remembrances for Harris from Scott though."
Earwolf,31z1v6,TheandreGreyjordan,5,Thu Apr 9 15:27:26 2015 UTC,"Plus Scott mentions ""apr 6, no wait 9"", so he knew for sure it was coming out this week. That would have been a long time to know when a random episode is coming out."

Sorry.""  http://forum.earwolf.com/topic/4035-episode-16-%E2%80%94-the-smurfs/page__st__20  I was a little worried about giving it a try, but after reading the forums, it sounds like a good ep that must have had outside complications.

Seems like a plausible theory."

I was looking up a bunch of Patton Oswalt stuff and came across this album, but when I heard Jimmy confidently berating his audience, I just had to learn more about this guy.  I looked him up and started listening to NeverNotFunny where I got introduced to all my Earwolf favorites like PFT, Andy Daly, Scottrick, etc.  A year or so later Scott announced Comedy Death Ray Radio on there and, bada bing, Podcastings!"

Earwolf,31vk44,patrickthewhite1,6,Wed Apr 8 18:45:51 2015 UTC,Honestly I thought it was just OK. Kitty was good as a guest but there was something lacking.
Earwolf,31vk44,VanceFerguson,4,Wed Apr 8 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they fawned over her in such a way that was confusing. She seemed cool and all, but it was an odd vibe for me as a listener. It does sound like they had a blast though."
Earwolf,31vk44,CrouchJr,11,Wed Apr 8 21:24:00 2015 UTC,"Howard always seems so nervous around female musical guests.  This episode had a weird vibe of both Howard and Kulap trying to prove to Kitty how cool and hip each of them are despite being older haha.    I loved the number 5 song on her chart too, called '285'  really fun, she has a great voice."
Earwolf,31vk44,nohorseman,8,Wed Apr 8 14:40:26 2015 UTC,It was on Broad City this year too! Kitty is invading all my fave comedy realms
Earwolf,31vk44,CrouchJr,2,Wed Apr 8 14:42:35 2015 UTC,"Oh really?  I'm still not through season 2, but I do love Broad City.  Cool!   I'm going to buy a bunch of her stuff, give her the old Who Charted bump."
Earwolf,31vk44,nohorseman,2,Wed Apr 8 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite DJs works with her a lot, this is my faaave:   Ryan Hemsworth - Day/Night/Sleep System (ft. Haleek Maul & Kitty) (her verse starts at ~3 minutes if you have a short attention span but the whole track is ahem tight)   Ay Shawty 3.0 was used in a mix by Ryan Hemsworth as well as the above song from his album but I gotta find it, I'll edit with it when I do  EDIT: found it! It's in his Rinse FM mix (Hemsworth starts at 47 minutes, he plays kitty at ~50'), but it's not so different from the regular studio version. Anyway, Ay Shawty is good and it's the first song I heard by her and I like it"
Earwolf,31vk44,nohorseman,8,Thu Apr 9 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"Great ep! I've liked Kitty for a while she fit in very well.   I thought the music chart was going to be the top 5 songs Kitty listened to most on Spotify, which would have been cool too. It was fun to hear her pride that her newer EDM stuff was popular.   I also liked how Ku started saying ""tight"" by the end of the show. That was tight."
Earwolf,31vk44,SmashingRectums,3,Wed Apr 8 14:40:21 2015 UTC,I'm thrown off by the mix of positive and negative comments on this post. I like Kitty and I like Who Charted but is this episode worth listening to?

Earwolf,31vk44,SmashingRectums,3,Thu Apr 9 00:06:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're absolutely right. I only asked because I had a ton of shit to get done tonight so I didn't know if I'd have time to listen to this but I think I'll give it a shot."
Earwolf,31vk44,nohorseman,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah! If you have a pre-existing positive opinion of Kitty you will like it. I love her twitter/IG account and many of the charming parts of her personality shine through, and I thought Ku and Wie had a great time with her. Whooch is often kind of throw-away, even if KuWie know the guest intimately, so I'd say it's objectively at least average, above average if you're asking your's truly"
Earwolf,31vk44,RadioRaheem_,10,Thu Apr 9 00:44:36 2015 UTC,Can't lie. I cringed a couple of times during this episode.

Earwolf,31vk44,lovers_acid,7,Wed Apr 8 17:12:37 2015 UTC,I did too but only because of Howards enthusiasm towards her. Considering how young she is I think she handled it well
Earwolf,31vk44,sourmilksmell,14,Wed Apr 8 18:03:27 2015 UTC,"Please don't take this negatively, I'm not singling you out, but for folks feeling that Howard and Kitty's dynamic was lecherous, those feelings are on you.   I'm old (older than Howard), and people lose their shit about how we (older guys) engage young people. If were nice to young people, we run the risk of people thinking we're creepy. If we act neutrally, people assume were old, bitter, and angry. Howard is hosting a show, and was being nice to his guest. He pointed out viewpoints held by Kitty, that he shared. This is something he does with every guest on the show. (except for Jason Nash)  I think Howard did a great job. He had a young guest, he was friendly, enthusiastic, and was trying to match the energy level.  Charts!"
Earwolf,31vk44,spikey666,6,Wed Apr 8 22:15:35 2015 UTC,Howard's just really in tune with young culture.
Earwolf,31vk44,onegallant,11,Wed Apr 8 22:38:37 2015 UTC,One might say he likes to keep a finger on the pulse of youth culture

Earwolf,31vk44,goofy_ball,0,Fri Apr 10 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't think there was anything really lecherous about Howard's demeanor, but his (and to a lesser extent Kulap's) breathless desire to be seen as cool and validated by Kitty was disorienting and kinda tiresome.  Kitty's, of course, younger and from a different world from most of the guests, so maybe that threw them, too. It wasn't just that he was pointing out viewpoints he and Kitty shared, he seemed almost desperate to be as cool as she was. A super-different vibe than I usually get off the show.   The format where they play a musician's own songs for them would work better if the musician was expressly interested in talking about her music or How and Ku had something major to say about them. But musicians often also have the most interesting stuff to say about other musicians' music."
Earwolf,31vk44,CrouchJr,7,Thu Apr 9 19:21:10 2015 UTC,"Ehh she's well above legal age isn't she?  She can handle that.  More seriously though,  I think it's more that Howard is always over aware that he is talking to another rapper/musician, and really wants to connect, and come off as cool to them."

Earwolf,31vk44,RadioRaheem_,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"I just think it was a bad matchup. Kitty being too hip and Howard and Ku not really knowing that much about her. Then the whole thing with Howard pushing his finger being on the pulse of youth culture. I know it's a tried and true bit, but it's not really the youth culture that Kitty is a part of. I wouldn't put all the blame on Kitty, and I also wouldn't put it all on Howard and Ku. The chemistry just wasn't really there for me, or at least I couldn't see it."

I've heard of Kitty in passing but never paid much attention to her work. But from this episode she seems like an alright person. I found her humble and interesting for the most part, putting in the work to develop her art. Not telling stories to come off as a ""hard"" or random, like Nova's stories about dealing drugs or telling the police shes a dinosaur.  Edit: That said, I dont know if I'll listen to Kitty's stuff, but I'm Probably not her target market."

Just always skip the intro and outro they get repetitive."

You Enjoy Myself, Harry Hood, AC/DC BAG, etc. Stuff that mostly draws from classic rock conventions. But I don't think I'm going to sit down and listen to their late 90s funk jams or spin their studio records.   I truly don't get the hatred of Phish. I guess it has something to do with the culture surrounding the band. Much of their music isn't really my cup of tea, but it's not offensive to me. I just find the stuff I don't like sort of boring."
Earwolf,31ujqq,PunkMoon,3,Wed Apr 8 13:07:34 2015 UTC,"As a Phish fan, I have realized most people who openly hate on Phish have never listened to them"
Earwolf,31ujqq,Memphish_Boognish,21,Wed Apr 8 14:44:18 2015 UTC,I went in not liking Phish and came out really not liking them. I know Phish are (besides vocally) musically proficient but I don't think they're at all talented when it comes to composition or lyrics. I also don't think they are concerned with that fact as they're aware 99% of their audience just wants to get totally fucked up out of their minds and just be at a Phish concert.  tldr: great cover band looking for a singer
Earwolf,31ujqq,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Wed Apr 8 12:06:10 2015 UTC,"There is no need to engage in any type of drug use whatsoever for anyone to enjoy Phish's music. People who say you must are generally fans of drugs first and the band second, honestly."
Earwolf,31ujqq,DanzigMeowMeow,0,Wed Apr 8 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"There's no need to use drugs to enjoy any music, but that really doesn't change the fact that there's a whole lot of the drugs first/band second people at Phish shows."
Earwolf,31ujqq,Memphish_Boognish,5,Wed Apr 8 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"Saying that ""99% of their audience just wants to get totally fucked up out of their minds and just be at a Phish concert"" makes you sound like a person who knows nothing about the band and just listens to stereotypes about things you don't know about and believes those stereotypes and reports them as fact because you heard them somewhere  Also I can agree with you about lyrics, but not many bands on this planet can touch Phish on composition"
Earwolf,31ujqq,DanzigMeowMeow,-3,Wed Apr 8 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"ok  Awesome downvotes! That's what I get for using phrases like ""I think"" and ""I don't think"", me and my stupid subjective personal opinions, but thanks for letting me know in absolutes that not many bands can touch Phish on composition. Complaining that I'm just making assumptions while stating the assumption that I'm an easily suggestible person who hasn't actually listened to Phish or been to a show makes good sense! 😀"
Earwolf,31ujqq,Memphish_Boognish,2,Wed Apr 8 15:51:41 2015 UTC,To be fair you said I don't think Phish is concerned with 99% of the fans going to the shows just to get fucked up implying that that part of the statement was fact.  And I was making that part of the assumption because I have a hard time believing anyone that's actually been to a show could possibly think that  I get why people don't like Phish and don't have a problem with that at all (in fact I enjoy that part of it) but just like any group I get upset when people just old put out negative stereotypes that aren't close to true or huge exaggerations at best as fact
Earwolf,31ujqq,DanzigMeowMeow,5,Wed Apr 8 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"Whatever, let's just be friends through the power of /r/Earwolf and agree that One D won't be the same without Zayn."
Earwolf,31ujqq,Memphish_Boognish,3,Wed Apr 8 16:55:03 2015 UTC,Agreed
Earwolf,31ujqq,klobbermang,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Phish and U2 have the same problem, the songs are just boring as hell."
Earwolf,31ujqq,arandompurpose,7,Wed Apr 8 21:59:38 2015 UTC,So I started knowing they were kind of a drug band I guess and didn't think much of their music. The episode with Adam Scott after he heard one of the songs (You Enjoy Myself maybe?) and he said 'I liked that' I had to agree. It was entertaining and while I don't really listen to them I at least respect them as proper musicians.
Earwolf,31ujqq,Fatmanredemption,5,Wed Apr 8 10:41:36 2015 UTC,"The first band I ever played in was comprised mainly of Phans/Deadheads. For a long time I viewed jam band music the same way I view soccer: fun to play, zero fun to watch/listen. But having since acquired a taste for Frank Zappa (known both for his intricate compositions/virtuosic players and a tendency to go off on 7 minute guitar solos over a vamp of one or two chords,) and listening to Analyze Phish for the 4th time, I'm now deciding to give them a try.   I love the '93 Harry's Hood (Was The Harriest Hood) in its entirety. But listening to something like Reba, I could tell they were trying to write their own ""Inca Roads"" or ""What's New in Baltimore?"" (magnificently complex songs by Frank Zappa which have in the middle/build up to a two-chord vamp guitar solo.) They were good at the jam part, but their attempts at avant-garde and dissonant music sound pretty random, like what somebody who didn't know much about music theory would think Frank Zappa's doing when in reality there's a lot of sensible thought put into his stuff.  However, if I can wholeheartedly unabashedly love Harry's Hood (It Recedes When I'm Excited,) there's gotta be something else in their catalogue I can dig, too. I haven't done that much exploring yet, and I might come out a real Phan. Though I kinda doubt it."
Earwolf,31ujqq,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Wed Apr 8 13:01:54 2015 UTC,I just can't see Phish ever writing anything musically on the level of Black Napkins. I can definitely see them writing something lyrically on the level of Why Does It Hurt When I Pee.
Earwolf,31ujqq,KillerPotato_BMW,3,Wed Apr 8 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"My dad is a huge Zappa fan and he says Phish is in no way BAD, but they tend to copy things like Zappa without much thought going into the orchestration. They're exactly what you said- random.    I don't mind it, but I'm not a musician. I just find Phish relaxing, though. I started with the studio albums and then searched for my favorite songs off of those, but live. Waste 11/02/96 is a song I just love."
Earwolf,31ujqq,stepintomyofficebaby,2,Wed Apr 8 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"In high school I was really into Phish, in fact I own six of their albums, and I've seen them in concert I think three times. Eventually I got sick of them so I was pretty apathetic about them. I kinda liked a couple songs, but that was it.  Listening to Analyze Phish made me hate them."
Earwolf,31ujqq,realjamesbrown,2,Wed Apr 8 13:17:45 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed Analyze Phish and a few of the songs sounded okay. I ended up buying one live album. I realized it's really good for studying and going to sleep! The jams are great for zoning out to
Earwolf,31ujqq,AliAtes,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"Analyze Phish solidifies that Phish as a band is an open helping friendly book of endless conversation and discovery... even the people who don't ""get it"" surrender to it and discuss it and make broad dumb statements about what ""99%"" of the fans at Phish shows are there for... but they're still here talking about it ...  it's funky!  Analyze Phish was not for Phish fans and was never meant to be... it was a comedy show about how Phish fans can't convince their friends to ""get it.""  And Harris did a great job illustrating our struggle...  The people who do ""get it"" are rewarded with 31 years of layered bootlegged music with side plots and back stories and funk and bliss and just when you think you know the band... they do something to surprise you.  You hear something you've never heard before.... or they play a set of Disney funk jams dressed as zombies... they're an endless well of discovery - and those of us that ""get it"" are lucky... with Phish you can always peel back another layer... being a fan is tapping into a music well that keeps giving... making it really fun to be a fan."

Earwolf,31svh2,gs-fl-bi,11,Tue Apr 7 23:03:49 2015 UTC,"You can do it multiple ways: pick an author you love or a comedian you love posing as that episode's author. For my money, some top picks are Chapter 15 (Andy Daly as Marquis de Sade), Chapter 24 (Jason Mantzoukas as Plato), Chapter 30 (Thomas Lennon as William Faulkner), and Chapter 34 (Ben Schwartz as Roald Dahl). As soon as PFT drops the episode with Lauren Lapkus as Beatrix Potter, it will rise to the top of this list."
Earwolf,31svh2,gerryblog,13,Tue Apr 7 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"The Iceberg Slim episode recently was also really funny, and the one PFT picked as his favorite in that recent interview."

Earwolf,31svh2,oshoney,2,Wed Apr 8 00:24:59 2015 UTC,Protip: episodes with two guests are a lot more informal and joke-laden if you're into that sort of thing. Good example is the one with Nietzche and Lovecraft. Or the one with Vonnegut and whoever else. Single guest shows tend to take their character's history a little more seriously.
Earwolf,31svh2,DanzigMeowMeow,2,Wed Apr 8 04:18:40 2015 UTC,"The Brothers Grimm is my favorite one ever, but you might as well start from the beginning, because they're all great. Needless to say, every episode featuring Andy Daly is amazing."
Earwolf,31svh2,headless_bourgeoisie,2,Wed Apr 8 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every episode is great. I'll recommend John Hodgman as Ayn Rand as well as the Shel Silverstein episode. Aesop is also very hilarious. And +1 to the other suggestions, Plato and Ben Franklin. But to be honest, they're all great. Don't feel bad if you don't know the author, I knew little about any of them but it's pretty easy to pick up on the exaggerated humor from the context."

I'm a single guy, but I'm not looking to manipulate anyone for the sake of ""getting laid."" I wish they had taken him to task a bit more."

Earwolf,31rfzt,mko09ijnm,8,Mon Apr 13 04:28:01 2015 UTC,I listened to the whole ep. Very strange to have that dude on. I was a little upset by how much they let him control the conversation and let him talk over them at every turn so he could essentially have an infomercial on the ep.  But the entire time they were definitely making fun of him and David definitely sounded like he was on the brink of slapping the dude.

Some highlights I've come across recently:    His latest appearance on Hollywood Handbook. He begins by saying the introduction is ""interminable"" (which is true) and then he tries to explain the Riddle Me This game, but Sean and Hayes are too preoccupied with monsters to understand him.     The episode of The TAH in which Jib Janeen is posing as Sparks' sidekick. He interrupts the theme song, cracking everyone WAY UP, and tries to explain that his nanotech innards are too overworked to deal with a space virus. It almost doesn't make actual sense, but it does.     On NYSU, his show-inside-a-show with Al Madrigal. (""Did you see that, Hot Dog?! Did you see what that cat did?!"")     Any episode of The Todd Glass Show with the Juice Bar Genie. ""You ask, 'Where is gym?' Go home you fat person. Gym won't help you, you are too fat. I spit on you.""

Earwolf,31m72f,sevillianrites,3,Mon Apr 6 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"I suggest just listening to them all, I think there's only about five episodes with Victor and Tiny on them. But my favourites were the one with Kumail Nanjiani/Jonah Ray (which made last year's top 10) and also the one with Alex Borstein.  Plus if you listen to their episodes in order, you get to hear the evolution of plugs theme addenda."

Earwolf,31ioa7,ElectricMarmalade,31,Mon Apr 6 12:07:34 2015 UTC,"Harris was really on fire during Not Farts and Pro 4.

Earwolf,31ioa7,TwoTacoTuesdays,27,Sun Apr 5 13:45:19 2015 UTC,"The whole scheduling email thing was really, really funny to me, and I have no idea why.

So bitter and hilarious, and yet you all know it was so full of love."
Earwolf,31ioa7,Slayner,12,Sun Apr 5 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been going through the backlog of who charted and yesterday I got to episode 115, and the guest was Harris Wittels.   The episode was incredible, probably my favorite who charted yet. It was their bizzaro episode which was funny, but Harris himself was just so effortlessly funny and laid back that it's always such a joy to listen to.   One sad thing mentioned on the podcast was that even 'after' Scott on analyze phish, Howard and Kulap mentioned he should keep the Podcast going but with a different guest to try to convince each time. They were talking about having Howard as the next guest to convince, needless to say it won't happen, but it had the potential to be the best thing ever.   Anyway to get off of that episode specifically I always find it amusing how Harris just got along with everybody I think that's part in why we were so upset with his passing is he felt less like some comedian spouting out jokes, and more like your buddy just shooting the shit with you.   I'll miss hearing new things from him, but I always get happy when - like yesterday I stumble onto a podcast with him in it I haven't heard yet. Keeping my laughing from beyond the grave."

The problem with it is you can't recommend it to new listeners because without all the background information on Howard and Ku it would make absolutely no sense.  They nailed it with having Harris guest for that episode.  I also want to add that Eastbound is probably my favorite show of all time.  Season 4 was a masterpiece, so much emotion, love, heartbreak, and funny."

Earwolf,31ioa7,Fatmanredemption,9,Thu Apr 9 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"I'm listening to the Comedy Bang Bang Podcast all the way through for the first time. I've currently listened to about 220 episodes. It's a strange feeling to know that I have several more months of material by Harris that I will come across and it will all be new to me. A dead man is making me laugh and will continue to make me laugh for a while.  It's eerie. But it also makes me very sentimental. I was a Harris fan before I listened to this podcast and his death was extremely difficult for me. And now that I have lots of new jokes and Foam Corner gags that will continue to make me laugh, it gives me a rush of depression. Since his death, CBB has been a constant reminder of the brilliance of that man. I laugh and tear up at the same time. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced. As difficult as it is for the fans, I can only imagine how hard it was for his friends to lose Harris. These podcasts are the equivalent of friends talking in a room and making each other laugh. The audience is basically just a fly on the wall. We get a taste of what it's like to be a friend of these comedians. Because of CBB, I can now imagine how fun it was in the writer's room on Parks and Rec or The Sarah Silverman Program and having Harris make everyone laugh. Fans of these podcasts feel a connection to the performers because we get a sense of what makes them who they are. And Harris was simply a lovable, funny dude.  So much great comedy left unwritten and unperformed because Harris couldn't get a hold of his deadly addiction. It's just so sad..."
Earwolf,31ioa7,thecricketnerd,6,Mon Apr 6 00:18:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't get Harris when I first heard him, which was on ""Impotent Teamsters Unite!"" Somehow I thought this guy was intentionally making bad jokes and acting like he didn't realize they were bad while never acknowledging with even the slightest hint he was just playing a character. But you know, something changed. Not sure when. Maybe it was on one of the episodes with Don't Stop Or We'll Die (whose breakout hit ""Austin and Ace"" became a guilty-pleasure of mine,) maybe it was one of the Holiday Spectaculars. But he grew on me, so I decided to give Analyze Phish a listen.  That turned out to be probably the best podcast of all time. I could relate so hard to the premise of a guy with an acquired musical taste trying to get people to change their perspective. I could also relate to Scott being that I totally didn't like Phish but almost every musician I've played with was a huge fan.  I quickly went and listened to every CBB podcast with Harris on it. Next to Patton Oswalt, he was my favorite non-character guest. Hell, even James Adomian had a couple appearances that didn't land with me, but every Harris podcast was enjoyable 'cause he was such a fun personable guy.  I should've been worried when I heard the 2nd You Made it Weird appearance, but I wasn't. Even though he had sunk even deeper since Analyze Phish, I thought he bounced back and was fine forever."

Earwolf,31ioa7,dihsho,18,Sun Apr 5 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"He would hate a lot of tributes that came out. But this really isn't a tribute or anything, it's just a ""hey, list some of your favorite moments by your favorite performers""."
Earwolf,31ioa7,TweetsInCommentsBot,7,Sun Apr 5 15:58:48 2015 UTC,It's similar to the respect threads for /r/whowouldwin so you can give them as a reference. And I hate when people make assumption about what people will and will not like. I mean are you a close friend of Harris or something.

Earwolf,31ezjj,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,6,Sat Apr 4 14:36:18 2015 UTC,Oh man that's awesome. I'm not huge into twitter but I find it cool that it's so easy to interact with our favorite comedians and stuff.
Earwolf,31ezjj,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,4,Sat Apr 4 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree. The downside of twitter is that the same tweet got a random guy saying he wanted to punch me to toughen me up.  I think he was joking, but, well, I can't be positive."
Earwolf,31ezjj,DanzigMeowMeow,5,Sat Apr 4 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"Well until they invent a way to punch people through a computer screen I'd say you're fine.   When that day happens though, be afraid!"

Earwolf,31ezjj,downwithlevers,3,Sat Apr 4 17:37:25 2015 UTC,Loving them! I'm learning lots but at the same time the focus is on playing around with a bunch of funny people. At this point I honestly can't see myself stopping any time soon.

Earwolf,31ezjj,headless_bourgeoisie,2,Sat Apr 4 18:43:22 2015 UTC,In London with a group called Hoopla.
Earwolf,31ezjj,nohorseman,9,Sat Apr 4 21:17:23 2015 UTC,"I'm doing my first open mic next week so I'm terrified. The problem is I don't think my material is THAT funny although I do feel like there are little things in there that could get a laugh. I'm going up there anyway of course because I'll never be able to improve without it.  Hopefully once I start doing this a little more I can move somewhere with a bigger comedy scene. I've got some friends in Portland so it would be really fun to live with them up there, but my real dream place to live is LA."
Earwolf,31ezjj,Pluppets,4,Sat Apr 4 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"Good luck! you got the right attitude so far, just no matter what happens remember two things.   One -  you have more balls than a ton of people to get up there and even try.   And two - you're right you can't improve until you try, so keep doing it man."
Earwolf,31ezjj,MysticBounce,2,Sat Apr 4 17:43:03 2015 UTC,"Have a blast! I did stand-up for a while and I'll bet after your first mic is over you'll be dying to feel that high again. Be prepared for sure but don't over worry, it's just an open mic :)"
Earwolf,31ezjj,funnyhowthings,8,Sun Apr 5 01:23:45 2015 UTC,"Yo, real talk? Got a question. I've been reading this sub for a few weeks now and realize I'm quite in the minority for preferring Analyze Phish over U Talkin' U2 to Me? As in I firmly still think of Analyze Phish as maybe the best podcast of all time (definitely in the top 4) because of how it combines humor with a real-life continuity narrative and a sincerity that's rare in Earwolf and most media in general. Whereas U Talkin' U2 To Me celebrates insincerity in the most over-the-top fashion with fuckloads of injokes and running gags that resonate a lot with Earwolf fans, but somehow this approach gets dangerously close to alienating me altogether. Though I don't totally hate it. I mean I have listened to 6 episodes. I think ""What's your deductable, bro?"" is a funny question. I'm hip.  But hey, if you are one of those people who definitively prefers one of these shows over the other, can you pinpoint why? Am I close to understanding the appeal?"
Earwolf,31ezjj,WithForte,5,Sat Apr 4 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"I like them both a lot it's hard to say what I like more because they're both fantastic I'm their own rights.   I like the absurdity of UTU2TM which makes me have more 'shock' laughs, but I'd say from like a binge listening take I might prefer analyze phish."
Earwolf,31ezjj,CrouchJr,5,Sat Apr 4 17:16:40 2015 UTC,I enjoy both equally but I definitely get where you're coming from.
Earwolf,31ezjj,angelfromthecoast,4,Sat Apr 4 18:26:46 2015 UTC,"I was too late to the game to be around for when Analyze Phish was in progress (for the most part). Although I was there day one for UTU2TM, baffled by it but checking it out anyway. So it's just a little more special since I was along for the ride."
Earwolf,31ezjj,nicemaker,5,Sat Apr 4 19:29:42 2015 UTC,"I think I thats part of the magic. Watching this show turn from a pretty straight forward U2 podcast, to a semi U2 related podcast about two guys and their lives, into two guys fucking around with a bunch of subpodcasts and occasionaly mentioning U2."
Earwolf,31ezjj,MeanLatifah,3,Sat Apr 4 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"Just relistened to episode 3 of AP the other week.  The story about 17 year old Harris getting a minute long hand job from a 40 year old woman at a Cowboy Mouth concert is amazing.   I love the U2 podcast in part because I find the musical nerdery as appealing as the humor,  as well as how freewheeling and long some episodes are. The fact that it all builds up to the commentary episode is fucking brilliant."
Earwolf,31ezjj,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,3,Sat Apr 4 21:16:25 2015 UTC,"I prefer Analyze Phish, because it is more about the music. I also prefer Phish to U2. I think that Adam plays more of the ""Harris Role"" on UTU2TM because he is more of a die hard- but even he admits that his favorite album No Line On The Horizon has a weak track or two.   Big fan of both shows."

Earwolf,31ezjj,nohorseman,5,Sat Apr 4 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"What would you all think of a new weekly thread, probably on Sundays, in the same vein as /r/respectthreads where we talk about all the greatest hits of a different member of the earwolf family each week. I was probably going to just call it Earwolf Respect Threads and I'd just randomly pick a prominent guest/host every week."
Earwolf,31ezjj,DanzigMeowMeow,6,Sat Apr 4 15:37:55 2015 UTC,I'm all for it. The first thread should definitely be Harris.

I fly for free and I want to go to more places this summer than my usual NYC, LA or Chicago. So tell me why I should visit your city (or, alternatively, tell me why I definitely should NOT go there)."
Earwolf,31ezjj,oshoney,3,Sat Apr 4 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"I was born in Cincinnati but never really lived there. That said, it's a cool place, classic city like environment, good sports teams, plenty of live venues the city is beautiful, and the food is great.   Specifically most people will sell you on Cincinnati chili, but go to some small shitty looking pizza shop and see if they sell hoagies. I promise you the hoagies up there in those small corner restaurants are absurdly good.   I admit I don't know Cincinnati too well though so I'll say the place I live now Dothan Alabama is a place you should never visit. Unless you like not going more than a quarter of a mile for a fast food restaurant or church then you're not gonna miss out on skipping the big ol' city of Dothan Alabama.   Fun fact though, if you landed in our gigantic luxurious airport (that only flies to and from Atlanta) you'll be within walking distance (less than a mile) away from my duplex."
Earwolf,31ezjj,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Sat Apr 4 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"I went to Cincinnati to watch my Titans play the Bengals and really enjoyed it. Oktoberfest was that weekend which helped, but still.   And yeah, I tried Skyline. I still don't know if I loved it or hated it. A bit of both I think."
Earwolf,31ezjj,oshoney,3,Sat Apr 4 19:26:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not a chili fan either so I feel you on that. I went to new Orleans for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I loved it there if you've never been. The food is every bit as good as they say it is.   Also, my condolences for being a titans fan lately."
Earwolf,31ezjj,DanzigMeowMeow,3,Sat Apr 4 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"Ha, thanks. It's been rough."
Earwolf,31ezjj,nohorseman,3,Sat Apr 4 20:11:31 2015 UTC,Well I'm a dolphins fan and I'm only 22 so it's not like I know the taste of success either.   I'll actually be going up to Tennessee to watch the dolphins @ titans game this year.
Earwolf,31ezjj,Bill-Cosby-Bukowski,3,Sat Apr 4 20:13:50 2015 UTC,Nice! I will be at that game as I won season tickets through a Budweiser contest somehow. No matter how bad we are this year I will be at every single game. I'm so excited about having season tickets. Ahhhhh.   You have got to try hot chicken while you're up here. Do you like spicy food?
Earwolf,31ezjj,oshoney,3,Sat Apr 4 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"Love spicy food, and fuck yeah man, through thick or thin you gotta support your team. Obviously winning is nice, but it's just fun to watch the games.   If I remember by the time that game rolls around we should meet up to tailgate."
Earwolf,31ezjj,downwithlevers,3,Sat Apr 4 20:28:51 2015 UTC,Yeah that would be great. We always have a big group tailgating and people are always welcome.   Hot chicken is my favorite food ever and it's a local specialty and it's so goddamn spicy and amazing. Ahhh. Love it so much.
Earwolf,31ezjj,Antonton,2,Sat Apr 4 20:30:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome. Well it's a long ways away so I'll try not to forget, but that sounds awesome. You'll also have to let me know the best place for that chicken"
Earwolf,31ezjj,downwithlevers,3,Sat Apr 4 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, but for me, I'd suggest Portland, SF and Colorado if you haven't been yet.  My hometown is not worth visiting, sorry."
Earwolf,31ezjj,Antonton,3,Sat Apr 4 18:50:02 2015 UTC,"I went to Colorado a lot as a kid, but haven't been as an adult so it's on the list. As are the other two. West coast cities are a little harder and take more planning than east coast for me tho. I'm in Nashville so places like Chicago and DC are easy for day trips or day and a half trips that I can fit into my off days. LA, SFO, Seattle, Portland, etc are a little more tricky. But I plan to hit them all at some point."

Earwolf,31ezjj,Antonton,2,Mon Apr 6 03:28:42 2015 UTC,My schedule at work just changed this week. The good part - I'm no longer on the midnight shift (which really means I usually don't leave till 1 or 2am). The bad part is my off days are now Tuesday-Wednesday instead of Saturday-Sunday. Blah.   All the shows in LA that happen on the weekends are off the table for me for the summer so that sucks. But Earwolf presents happens twice monthly on Tuesdays so maybe I'll be able to fly out for one of those if it's something good.
Earwolf,31ezjj,downwithlevers,6,Sat Apr 4 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Look at this guy, flying out to LA just to catch a comedy show, like some kind of Michael Ableson."
Earwolf,31ezjj,Antonton,3,Sat Apr 4 15:57:48 2015 UTC,Heh. Well I work for an airline specifically so that I can fly free to do cool stuff like that. Otherwise no chance I'd be able to.

In 1990 they were talking about how Gary was buying Cartoon replicas (cells) from Bugs Bunny and shit like that. He was talking about one of the ones he wanted was Baba Looey, but he said it as ""Baba Booey"" and the rest was history. Howard Stern was a big deal especially in the 90s and people would prank call into call in shows to yell ""bababooey"" at inappropriate times to spread the word of howard stern.  The origin from the stern show 1990 https://youtu.be/KEZY32dq3CI?t=2m  The most famous Bababooey prank call on a show was in 1994 during the OJ Simpson chase.

It seems like something that would be fun to watch live, but there is a reason it hasn't taken off as a big podcast hit, and listing all these episodes as ""best"" doesn't really fit."

I LOVE Todd Glass's comedy. The Jingles are funny, his 'failed' bits are great, his guests are solid. The one thing that I can't STAND are the fact that his listener base emails him every week talking about how they can't stand it when he uses some word or phrase, and then he has to spend that huge monologue exclaiming how he's going to stop using it.  You can only hear, ""Maybe I'm wrong and in 20 years when someone looks back they will say Oh he's an idiot or Oh he was right!"" so many times. He WILL say that 245 times an episode also.   I love him though, I just don't get offended at everything he says like apparently some of the listeners do."

At one point they opened it up for audience Q&A, which went a little slow because we weren't expecting it. They were still ironing out some of the kinks, but it was only the 7th episode. It will definitely be a fun podcast to listen to."
Earwolf,312m4c,Antonton,3,Wed Apr 1 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, it was the 7th one? I didn't figure they'd make so many episodes of a podcast before releasing the first one.  Anyway, good to know! Thanks for reporting in. I can't wait to hear how this show goes."

Earwolf,312m4c,illme,0,Thu Apr 2 07:12:22 2015 UTC,"April Fools I am guessing. I love the CBB characters but they don't all need their own shows, much for the same reason many great SNL skits don't always translate into great movies, if that makes sense. Keep it short and sweet."
Earwolf,312m4c,dadkisser,8,Wed Apr 1 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"Nope, there's a real press release on Midroll and they've already recorded at least one live episode of this thing. It's real."
Earwolf,312m4c,dadkisser,2,Wed Apr 1 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow. Well there ya go. Maybe it will be great, who knows. I have my doubts about how much you can squeeze from Marissa Wompler as a main character in a podcast but I will try to reserve judgement until I see how it goes. Certainly a funny character, I have to give her that."
Earwolf,312m4c,CrouchJr,5,Wed Apr 1 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"Im kinda worried too?  And I want to be proven wrong, but for me the Lapkus podcast hasn't been great, even though she slays every CBB appearance.  I'm worried about flooding the market with specific characters, when the real magic is working out the characters."
Earwolf,312m4c,read_the_article_,13,Wed Apr 1 17:11:00 2015 UTC,"The issue with her podcast is the premise and that it relies solely on how good of a host her host is.   Lapkus is 100% a super star improviser that can come up with the best scenarios, but all of that can't be fleshed out with a person who is not a great host.  The high quality episodes of the Lapkus podcast all had great hosts (scotty auks, Thomas Middleditch, Andy Daly, Sean/Hayes, PFT, etc).  This is not to say the lackluster episodes had bad improvisers (in fact all of those improvisers are excellent), it's just that they lack in great hosting.  Because of this, I don't think the podcast can ever ""gain its footing"""
Earwolf,312m4c,CrouchJr,2,Wed Apr 1 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"Perfect.  I'm not so eloquent, but this is the truth."
Earwolf,312m4c,thecricketnerd,5,Wed Apr 1 21:41:41 2015 UTC,But she's done a different character every episode. Only Reardon is recurring!

Earwolf,312m4c,CrouchJr,3,Wed Apr 1 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Just that, to me at least, the best part of her characters is hearing then develop in a very structured environment, like CBB, with a 'straight man' like Scott to escalate or ground whatever situation arises, and to introduce new information to this new character.  If that makes sense?  Obviously her show has lots of fans, and that's awesome!  I'm pulling for her too."
Earwolf,312m4c,thecricketnerd,2,Wed Apr 1 18:05:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, fair enough. I'm sure a few characters from her podcast will make it to CBB, the rest will remain one-shots though."
Earwolf,312m4c,dadkisser,0,Wed Apr 1 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, pretty much this. I just keep thinking of the ""Ladies Man"" movie when I hear things like this. I mean a great character is sometimes left in a guest appearance spot where they stay tasty and leave you wanting more.   That said I love these comediennes and it's not like the characters aren't good, it's just, I hope this doesn't ruin them for me."

Earwolf,312m4c,CrouchJr,3,Wed Apr 1 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I was just poking fun haha, some women comedians really do not appreciate it though.  Like Chelsea Peretti I believe, I've heard it a lot before, and I know Scott says it on CBB to get under the skin of female guests too."

Earwolf,30xj6x,CrouchJr,2,Wed Apr 1 20:50:15 2015 UTC,People always bring up the hostility between him and Kyle but I just don't see it.   My observations are that David hated being interrupted or when he can't get a word in so usually he sits out for large portions. But you can always hear him laughing or giggling when he talks so I'm sure he's having a good time.   Kyle and David just seem to have a brotherly type of friendship. They give each other shit but it's either not too serious or all in good fun.
Earwolf,30xj6x,wafflesocks,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:55:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I think he plays up the hostility but is just way more subtle about it than Tig and Kyle. I think he enjoys being along for the ride as much as actually having a conversation.

For example they did a episode exploring the start of the French Internet.   Hound tall- 3 comedian try to learn from a smart person.   Tell em Steve Dave - legendary status in the podcast game. Start from episode one. They are the friends and inspiration for Kevin smith. Two life long friends and another friend talk about mess up things from Hitler to the flea market in new Jersey. The best episodes are the makin hay series.

Betsy Sodaro - The Write Stuff: Casablanca   https://soundcloud.com/hollywoodhandbook/betsy-sodaro-our-close-friend#t=9:28  The boys do a read-through on the opening scene in Casblanca and start with having Engineer Brett making the sound for starting the selection machine. Lots of great stuff, also great line about making fun of people just repeating lines from podcasts.  For short listen just focus on the Engineer forced to make sounds, but the whole Casablanca read is great.  Betsy Sodaro - A listener question about sound engineers (also references the Gil Ozeri incident)  https://soundcloud.com/hollywoodhandbook/betsy-sodaro-our-close-friend#t=1:05:42  Jes Macallan - Drop the mic (Engineer Brett freaks out about 300$ microphones)  https://soundcloud.com/hollywoodhandbook/macallan-our-close-friend#t=57:13  ""Ooooh 300$ dollars they cost 300$ dollars ooooh. That's what YOU sound like Brett. That's YOU.""  Kind of a trend going on here maybe, but I just love when they get antagonistic against someone which is usually the engineer. Also the Jes McCallan episode has some great Italian bits but I'm not sure how to summarize it into one link.   The Gilmore Guys - Sean is a guest on another podcast  Sean turns out to be a bit of a jerk against Hayes on another podcast and they way the situation escalates and eventually defuses is some hilarious mental gymnastics.  https://soundcloud.com/hollywoodhandbook/the-gilmore-guys-w-demi-adejuyigbe-and-kevin-porter#t=48:48"

Earwolf,30ugug,WeeBabySeamus,9,Tue Mar 31 06:10:13 2015 UTC,I'm legitimately surprised the Scott and Jeff Ulrich episode hasn't been posted. Incredible improv from Will Hines and the boss / employee dynamic is hilarious.
Earwolf,30ugug,Home-Baked,3,Tue Mar 31 02:53:44 2015 UTC,And Neil Casey! I love that old timey voice he uses.
Earwolf,30ugug,thejjar,9,Tue Mar 31 17:43:15 2015 UTC,The Sinbad episode is one of my favorites.  They really go after the the engineer in that one (I think Cody but maybe Brett but really who even cares which one)
Earwolf,30ugug,WeeBabySeamus,8,Mon Mar 30 20:59:26 2015 UTC,I still can't get over how game Sinbad was

Man pretty much every ep."

Earwolf,30ugug,vagued,2,Tue Mar 31 02:39:07 2015 UTC,I listened to this one on my way home from work today and I was cracking up pretty much the whole time. One of my favorites for sure.

Earwolf,30s8sz,thejjar,2,Mon Mar 30 23:47:27 2015 UTC,I don't know about that. There were two very weak episodes early this year (the David Cross and the one before that?). I was concerned.

Earwolf,30s8sz,fireworksordie,9,Mon Mar 30 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"That's a good question  I would say he's probably the busiest guy out of the SV cast. He has ad campaigns, movies, and his own podcast that sucks up most of his free time. All that on top of (just from following him on Twitter and Instagram) seemingly constantly traveling or going to an event of some sort.   He also is NOT one to stick to a format, even of his own podcast, which is funny on a show like DLM or CIwTJM, but if he started breaking the fourth wall on CBB it might not work as well.   It's probably much more of the former, as he's really never on a podcast at all except for DLM when he's already in town."

Earwolf,30s8sz,ivtecdoyou,2,Mon Mar 30 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"Ya he's usually serious when he's a guest, but I feel like the way he acts on cashing in is so absurd that it would fit in on CBB. At least in terms of interacting with a character and playing along."
