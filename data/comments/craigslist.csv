craigslist,3cx84d,kwpg3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:38:57 2015 UTC,My strategy for selling unwanted items on CL is to initially list them for what I would like to get paid. Each time I have to relist the item I'll lower the price from $5-10 bucks until it sells. This works get when you're not in a hurry to sell and want to maximize profit.

This ad, however, has a slightly different location but the same phone number so it's definitely her.  I've been in e-mail contact with her.

By putting the email address on a public post, they know it's going to get a lot of spam but they're trying to take you out of the already Wild West-ish Craigslist ecosystem and communicate with you directly.

It's honest and straight to the point.  Either way, people are offended by every little thing that goes against their beliefs.  It's just the world we live in.  And people tend to be much ""bigger"" when communicating over text or email.  Making an offer in person is a completely different situation and the following conversation would have most likely been much more calm and understanding for both parties.    I try to only make low offers in person.  It's a lot more respectful to show your full interest by viewing the item directly before offering.

About a week later I got a call from that phone number, but they didn't let it ring enough for me to answer.  I didn't call them back.  I think that if I was to call that number they would charge my cell phone account. This is my best guess so far."
craigslist,3c3u3g,cb_dt,-3,Sat Jul 4 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"Craigslist isn't about buying and selling. It's about spam, scams, flagging, filters deleting your ads, phone verification, lowballers, no-shows, etc.  The buying and selling is on facebook groups."
craigslist,3c13nk,74123,14,Fri Jul 3 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"Tha checks fake, you're to deposit it and send the wheels and remaining balance back, in a couple days when the bank figures out its fake you're out the 2500 and your tires. shred the check cut all contact and move on with your life."
craigslist,3c13nk,Goingdef,10,Fri Jul 3 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"This is a classic scam: Deposit the check, send a check back for the difference, check bounces, you're screwed out of your item and the cash.  When this happened to me in college, I went to the bank and explained it, and asked them to run the check through their fraud system to see if it's fraudulent (which it will be). At that point I would contact the police with the address and name of the person who sent it or contacted you. (chances are this won't actually be the same person who sent the check, but you never know)  After that, cut all contact with them, and move along."
craigslist,3c13nk,Tullyswimmer,5,Fri Jul 3 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"Banks don't have a ""fraud"" system. Best a bank could do is if the check is drawn on the bank where you're taking it to, they could check the account status.  Otherwise, they would send it for processing and the check would bounce a few days later and the depositer would be out the difference plus typically a fee for a bounced/returned check."
craigslist,3c13nk,dawnofthemichael,2,Fri Jul 3 22:27:49 2015 UTC,I think it was basically a dummy depositer. They used it to see if a check would clear.

I wouldn't really correlate the two at all, it just means that the IP/block your ISP has currently assigned you has more recent activity on Craigslist or potentially spammed it in the past."
craigslist,3bskrs,pompousrompus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"Hm, this seems somewhat plausible. I would think that CL would punish IP ranges based on what pages they're accessing. But maybe not. The posting I was managing was for a remote region."

craigslist,3bskrs,dugber,2,Wed Jul 1 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think I wasn't clear enough. Pressing the ""reply"" button or the ""show contact info"" button (I think that's what it's called) triggered the anti-spam test. So, this, at the time at least, made it very difficult to access the remailer address or included phone number.  It is working now, so that's good. However, I'm still a bit concerned that the spam blocker might be a bit too aggressive."

craigslist,3bskrs,dugber,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"I have an update to this. The above happened to me on another website and it appears that it is a fallback method employed by reCaptcha. The reason I suspect this is because I had the same problem on popmoney. However, the problem went away when I disabled Disconnect and uBlock. So, if anyone else is having a similar problem, it may be because of extensions that block scripts and whatnot from loading. I'll post this down below too.  EDIT: to clarify. After disabling those extensions, reCaptcha employed a simple checkbox."
craigslist,3bskrs,dugber,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:01:32 2015 UTC,Craigslist is sinking faster than myspace went down. Craigslist is so slow it's hardly worth listing for free. Most of the users who buy and sell on facebook don't even bother with craigslist anymore. It's a waste of time.

craigslist,3bskrs,casemodz,-1,Thu Jul 2 03:49:20 2015 UTC,"NYC is a strange area. Unfortunately, it may be one of the few exceptions.  You will find tons of groups, with thousands of members, buying and selling sneakers. I really don't get it.   Every other city/location you look up has buy/sell groups selling everything that would normally be sold in classified listings.

He told me he didn't live local and if I could sell it on ebay so he could buy. I did that, but since I don't really ship stuff I forgot how much shipping and packaging actually costs. By the time I paid for the shipping and for Fedex to package it for me, I didn't really make any money. A total waste of time, but I did get positive feedback on ebay for it.   I wouldn't trust some unknown escrow. Go the ebay and paypal route like I did, but account for shipping and packaging better than I did. If that person doesn't have an ebay account with a history they are a scammer. On ebay unlike shitlist(and Reddit), people have actual reputations that matter, that they care alot about and don't want to ruin because so much effort and history is invested into it.

No one wants to try pick up an item if it might be gone. That is what the userbase wants. Try to repost but the same will likely happen.    But curb alerts are worthwhile for people in the immediate vicinity. If the cheap asses were not such time wasters, I wouldn't list curb alerts if they could act like normal responsible people. Or I often get:      If you don't like it leave, no one forces you to use craigslist.      Craigslist has hugely declined and is going into a slow deathspiral.

Sometimes buying stuff is semi-difficult in that alot of the dismally stupid public that uses the site sell stuff never take the ad copy down till it expires. But if you are not a flake or an idiot you can buy stuff, you will just be often disappointed at all the stuff you think is for sale, but is really sold. The problem is that for sellers, you don't really get replies and when you do most are from flakes and morons.   I bought this beautiful Waterford 1200 road bike from Craigslist last year. But that was me, I exchanged 3-4 emails with the seller, arranged to meet him up in Williamsburg, NYC, called him before I left off for the train and called him when I arrived. Then I gave him the $950 and even some extra for new pedals, since unlike most idiots I always draw out extra money just in case. But that is not how most Craigslisters are, that was me, there are so many people out there that make selling difficult because they are time wasters."

craigslist,3b8csk,orangetiem,3,Fri Jun 26 20:05:18 2015 UTC,Sellers don't have to list their exact location.
craigslist,3b8csk,sixtrees,2,Fri Jun 26 22:16:09 2015 UTC,Database load. It takes a lot of work to real time calculate the distance between two records and work load goes through the roof when you have 20k records.  Google and other big sites can do it because they have huge server farms and 1000's of developed paid with revenue from ads.  Craigslist is free with like ten developers paid with free coffee and donuts.

craigslist,3aj9a6,SixtyCycleBum,2,Sat Jun 20 23:21:51 2015 UTC,It's not out of the ordinary. I do nationwide CL searches sometimes. A few months back I was looking for passenger pegs for my bike. They're hard to find used and ordering from the stealership is cost prohibitive so I started searching CL and found a guy with a set in CO. He agreed to ship them to me if I would send a check. Worked out perfectly.
craigslist,3aj9a6,had0ukenn,2,Sat Jun 20 23:06:06 2015 UTC,"Ive bought some books from different states off of CL, even used paypal to do it."
craigslist,3aj9a6,Gameattic1,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:00:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly after talking to him on the phone I would have taken PayPal, but eBay has all my money after my first sale they claimed it was resealed with an ""anchor measuring cup"" inside. It sat in a locked storage room for 3 years, and I've never used an ""Anchor"" brand in my life. Plus the buyer is on a bad buyer website for doing the same thing to brand new accts.  Last time I don't Google a username.. but I digress."

craigslist,3aj9a6,casemodz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:27:51 2015 UTC,Not weird.  You can tell he's a serious collector.  Both parties are satisfied. Good transaction.
craigslist,3a8z6d,blvrcks,8,Thu Jun 18 04:20:49 2015 UTC,"I have requested payment this way when selling my last car. I am buying a house and the bank needs proof of where the cash came from, hence a certified check or cashiers check."
craigslist,3a8z6d,satin_rules,6,Thu Jun 18 16:09:42 2015 UTC,"That's pretty weird. Maybe he thinks once you've made the commitment to get a cashier's check you'll be less likely to back out or something. Which doesn't make sense since you can just return the check to the bank and re-deposit the money. Either way if he has the legitimate title and you're happy with the price, it shouldn't matter how you pay. You might run a vin check on the car before you hand him the money though or better yet before you even fly out there."
craigslist,3a8z6d,fuzzydunloblaw,6,Thu Jun 18 04:55:28 2015 UTC,Everything went smooth. Ended up being some sort of situation where he is probably only reporting part of the income from the sale.  I just know the dangers of accepting cashiers checks and it made me wonder why the seller was so trusting. But in the end he was just a nice guy that put his trust in me so that's good!
craigslist,3a8z6d,thescrapplekid,3,Thu Jun 18 21:45:28 2015 UTC,Maybe its so you're not flying with a shit ton of cash?
craigslist,3a8z6d,juicetyger,2,Thu Jun 18 15:22:33 2015 UTC,He may be doing this to avoid paying some taxes on the sale.
craigslist,3a8z6d,KeavesSharpi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:30:23 2015 UTC,Yeah ultimately that's I figured out. There was some advantage to him of not reporting all of the income on the sale
craigslist,3a8z6d,hedjhog,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"Some good reasons here already- taxes, safety, etc. He  may also be concerned about counterfeit money, getting pulled over and losing to the police in civil forfeiture, etc. There's really no additional risk to you.

craigslist,3a5sel,deathwhitch,3,Thu Jun 18 05:03:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, $35 might work, it's just that the tone of his reply was like ""here is $20, done deal, where are you so that I can buy the shoes."""

Ironic because I'm pretty sure we had included ""no drugs""; his breath gave it away, though...  I think the quality of anonymous Craigslist is very low compared to Facebook, where people are accountable because their profiles are constantly visible. I think I'm never turning to CL again. Safety is a separate and huge matter, indeed, but just not even getting what you want in the first place is ultimately the issue. You can try it. Meet somewhere loud and public (e.g., a crowded restaurant), or be with a friend or two. But your time would probably be better spent tapping into your social networks, whether literal (Facebook) or not (just asking friends/family/friends of family)."

craigslist,39r201,PlasmidXD,3,Sat Jun 13 22:40:04 2015 UTC,"I wrote up an ad and listed it in the M4W personals section about 3 years ago and received about 8 responses from women. It was surprisingly more successful than I thought it would be, in that anyone at all responded. Of those responses there was a girl who stood out right away. She was pretty by the images and I really clicked with her, just the way she wrote things I felt like I knew a fair amount of her personality right away.   I didn't really spend much time getting to know the other responders, there was a second one that I put a small amount of effort into getting to know but with the majority of my interest in Bonnie, I just didn't really pursue it. So Bonnie and I began exchanging emails and we both agreed we'd like to exchange numbers and text. We had really good conversation and within a few days she invited me over for bowls on the porch.   Everything fit really well, her humor countered mine and vice versa. We just had a really great time with each other on all levels. We ended up sleeping together one night and we connected really well, it was amazing for both of us. Things were just rad, we were going out on dates and I really thought I could spend forever with her.   Then things took a turn. I had some family hardships, mother OD'd but they brought her back in ER. It ended up getting in the way of a night we planned on spending together and I made the mistake of not calling Bonnie or letting her know what was going on for almost two hours after the time I was meant to arrive. She really seemed slighted more than I felt a person should be given what was going on, but I also felt like she had a point that there was a moment where I could have made a quick call to her just let her know.   All in all the entire thing got blown out of proportion in a text argument which was horrible. We broke up and ignored each other for about 7 months. One day she texted me and said she'd understand if I didn't reply but she could really use some herb and had no other sources to obtain any. I agreed and we had sex the following night, I feel like she probably could have found herb elsewhere and she was just missing the sex as much as I was.   We agreed very quickly to maintain an FWB type understanding, we both seemed on board with it. That went on for several months, things were good. We'd still cuddle sometimes and watch movies, it wasn't strictly fuck buddies or anything. I gave a shit about her yanno? Work on her car, take out the trash when I was leaving, this sort of thing. I guess I believed that was a thing, that we could sort of halfway a relationship.   I had an interest in learning massage techniques so she was also an awesome body to have on hand. I'd go by there more nights than not and give her full body massages, rub her feet, I'd hook it up. I think I just took the passion a little too far for being in what we were calling an FWB situation. Something must have happened because all of a sudden she snapped when I had a little family drama again. She raged at me, through text yet again and said this is my routine, that I always blow her off when my family is going through some shit.   Granted, my family is a bit dramatic and often times I'm pulled in to mediate or something but I just feel like wait, aren't we FWB's? Didn't we agree that we were not in a relationship and there really shouldn't be this extreme level of expectations? So the couple times that she blew up like that she gets really angry and I just have no interest in fighting with her so I politely exit the war she's trying to wage.   It's been a few months now that we haven't talked and if I'm being honest, I fuckin miss her. I miss her humor, she was able to make me laugh a lot. I miss the way her skin tastes, her scent. I wish I could have her in my life somehow, but we just can't figure out how to make it work right now unfortunately.   I think one of us will give in and make contact with each other one of these days, I'm having a hard time not contacting her. I can't say the entire craigslist experience has been successful on all levels, but if you're asking if I've successfully met someone on craigslist, yes I have. She was kinda nuts, I think I probably am too."

craigslist,39hbk6,SkunkMonkey,-3,Thu Jun 11 21:19:55 2015 UTC,"Oh it's the craigslist fanboy. Why does this fanboy love CL?   Craigslist is free. As is facebook.  You can save money buying on CL. As you can on facebook.  You can make money selling unwanted items on CL. As you can on facebook.  You can flag your competitors items on CL. Not on facebook. Users can't fuck with your listings.  Craigslist will ""ghost"" your listings (on an arbitrary basis).  Not on facebook.   Craigslist requires phone verification and prevents you from verifying with mobile phone numbers. No phone verification required on facebook.  You can't post hyperlinks on craigslist. No problem on facebook. You can post all the hyperlinks you want to your website or wherever you like. If you create your own buy/sell group, facebook will promote your group and increase traffic.   Craigslist traffic is declining. Facebook buy/sell groups are growing. More members andmore traffic every week.  Craigslist deletes posts from users who post ""too much"". In 10+ years they've never stated what ""too much"" is. You can post a hundreds/thousands of items on facebook.  Facebook will eventually bury craigslist. Why? Facebook doesn't limit the number of groups and number of postings. You can list in multiple groups and create your own groups. Craigslist is all about restricting users. Facebook is all about generating growth for their buy/sell groups."

It was left handed and I found it sticking out of my neighbor's trash can, I wanted it gone, but I knew I could get $150)  He walks out to his truck, came back and was like ""I found this in my truck.""

If I gave the impression that all I do with my time is flag people on Craigslist, that was not my intention.  I have looked for other ways to find free stuff in my area, like freecycle and facebook, but freecycle is a wasteland and all the local Facebook stuff is for sale, not free.  I guess I got spoiled because the last city I lived in didn't have these BS problems.  I guess dealing with crap that doesn't belong on there is the not-so-hidden cost of the stuff I find there."

Like 8 months later the guy messages me saying all of the fish have died and that the tank is cracked and he wants a refund. I just told him there were no discussions of a return or refund and that it was not going to happen. The dude lived like 2 hours away so I don't think he was going to drive to my house anyways but if he did I just let him know I wasn't giving him anything and that I will defend my property if I have to. He never showed up so it worked I guess. You should be fine the guys probably just angry
craigslist,38u4hp,TrippyToast0,11,Sat Jun 6 23:19:32 2015 UTC,Ask him if he put it on its side during transport. If he did he might have messed up the coolant system. I did this to a fridge once and it crapped out shortly after.

The auction ends after a period of time, typically ten to twenty seconds, without new bids; the last participant to have placed a bid wins the item and also pays the final bid price, which may be significantly lower than the retail price of the item. The auctioneer makes money in two ways: the fees for each bid and the payment for the winning bid, totalling typically significantly more than the value of the item.

craigslist,388fxp,INeverPutMyRealName,6,Tue Jun 2 16:38:57 2015 UTC,Don't mail anything - it's a fake check. It'll clear straight away and then bounce in a couple of weeks.   Don't believe me? Contact the issuing bank.
craigslist,388fxp,cliveholloway,5,Tue Jun 2 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, pretty typical scam. The person offers more than what you're asking to get you excited, usually with a little extra to do a 'favor' which involves giving money to somebody. They tell you to cash the check, take the extra money and give it to somebody.  Unfortunately X amount of time later, the check will finally come back fake or whatever, your bank will suddenly show $1500 less (or whatever the check is), and now you've sent money you didn't actually have to somebody and are responsible for paying the bank back."
craigslist,388fxp,flappity,3,Tue Jun 2 18:20:24 2015 UTC,Next thing --- he will say deposit the check and send him a wire for the difference.  Then the check will bounce.    Even if the issuing bank says it's good -- that is only for the moment.  Doesn't mean it will be good when it gets presented.
craigslist,388fxp,BobHHowell,3,Tue Jun 2 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"It's a scam. I've heard this exact story before.

craigslist,388fxp,barneytoe,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:33:56 2015 UTC,I bet he will contact you and try to get you to send 'back' the extra money. Then the check will bounce and you'll lose the cash.

craigslist,38bfhh,RealDiels,0,Wed Jun 3 03:20:25 2015 UTC,"My last 3 facebook sales came within 15 minutes of posting. People comment right away and say they want to buy.   If it doesn't sell right away, the listings drop down the list and I don't hear from anyone. It's like the next chance to sell is when you repost and bump the listing back to the top.  I wonder if anyone actually uses the group search. Whatever, I'll take the sales any way I can get them. It's been months since I've sold anything on craigslist. Right after Christmas. Really hard to believe."

I'm not sure if we need separate categories. 100 to 300 postings per day and anyone can use search to find what they are looking for.   I would like to see facebook make a serious effort at a classifieds section.   Their last attempt (with oodle) was weak. If they put a classifieds link on EVERY homepage, they would probably have a busy classified site for most cities.   Should have been a no-brainer to include a link on home pages. Not sure if they were really serious about classifieds working or not."
craigslist,38bfhh,triforce721,2,Thu Jun 4 00:17:25 2015 UTC,I think it's because it's easier to contact people on Facebook and because people see your name I think that makes people a little less worried meeting you in some parking lot to pick it up.

As for all the other crap on CL, the lowballers, the stupid questions that are answered right there in the text of the ad, sometimes those people actually buy stuff, and I try to respond to them as if that were true.   I do get frustrated sometimes with the slow pace, but AFAIK there's no better free marketplace out there.  And I remember the time before CL.  Classified newspaper ads for 3 or 4 $ per week per item; garage sales, get a dime for a dollar item; consignment stores, give up a commission.  CL is okay in my book."

Nothing wrong with making lowball offers. It's a free country (or use to be) and the seller is free to decline.  The problem I hear from most people trying to sell on craigslist, is that is the ONLY offers they get. People not buying anything unless they can double the price and list it on eBay.

I mean, I guess you don't want it to be a meth lab, so get some references, maybe friend them on Facebook.

That's a common scam, they'll pay WAYY over the required amount, ask you to send the remainder back, and then your bank will tell you it was bad money and you'll be out a ton of money"

Most likely not deposit it.. banks hit you for fee's with ""bad checks"" that's just my experience.. not about it being a forgery or anything or Non Sufficient funds.. they just have fee's :(   Fell for a craigslist scam! What now?   Nothing.. move on! with your life..   Call the police?   The cops won't care.. but you can fill out paperwork and stuff if it makes you feel better?  What you can do is.. hit the craigslist link for scam email.. (bottom of every email reply) and report it.. doesn't mean they won't random email the next guy.. just means they'll have to do a little more work to get back to ""the fishing"" that they do.. your a fish who bit and broke the line and got away.. congrats.. they'll still keep fishing though.. waiting for that fool to swallow the hook whole."

craigslist,37362q,TheDanimal438,5,Sun May 24 13:02:08 2015 UTC,Problem I have is peoe think that because they paid $100 for something it's worth $100. As soon as the wrapper is off its worth $50. Do not try to sell it for more than $66.
craigslist,37362q,Ferrisprost,2,Mon May 25 02:42:32 2015 UTC,Delivering heavy items to people who still want to negotiate. Negotiating after both parties have agreed. Buyer not having funds after 3 other buyers have been turned away. Fear of physical harm from the buyer.
craigslist,37362q,coinslists,1 point,Fri May 29 01:36:56 2015 UTC,"Not a huge deal and life goes on, but this was a little annoying this morning.  I've had a $10 item up for sale on craigslist for months now and someone finally emailed me yesterday morning asking if they could come pick it up within 2 hours. Annoying off the bat to assume that I'm monitoring my email all day so I of course don't see it until after his 2 hour window.  I call him at the # he left to make other arrangements and he's only available Saturday night after 9pm or Sunday morning at 8 am. Annoyance #2 in picking odd times of the day to be available, but I go with the 8 am option. Send him email with address and specifically ask if he's running late or can't make it to please call me between 7:30 - 8 am.  8 am comes and goes. No one shows up. Ok, I'll give him a few minutes for error or traffic. Which isn't likely this early in the morning. I finally call him around 8:20 and he says he's a few minutes away. Ok, no problem. Guy doesn't show until between 8:30 - 9 am.  He gets here and of course only has a $20 for the $10 item and I don't have any change on me, so now I have to wait for him to drive to a local convenience store to get change and bring it back.  Again, my day isn't ruined and I'm not pissed, but it's just one of those minor annoyances with dealing with people via craigslist. Something that should have been as simple as pulling up, handing him the item and him handing me $10 turns into me sitting around for an hour on a Sunday morning before all is said and done.  Simple etiquette is all that's needed. Be available at decent hours, show up when you say you're going to show up and call if you're running late, have the correct amount of money on you for the item and don't assume the seller has change on them, and don't ask me if I have anything else for sale. This isn't a yard sale. Am I expecting too much of people?"
craigslist,37362q,KeavesSharpi,2,Sun May 24 13:10:57 2015 UTC,"No, I think you're right in expecting  common courtesy. That said, You need to keep in mind that people suck, and generally only think about themselves and their friends and family as actual people. To them, you're just an internet person with a thing. You need to hold them to account. So if they agree to say, be at your house at 8, you need to tell them that you will be leaving at 8:30 for example. Or, set demands yourself. You're the one with the item for sale. If they want it, they can work with you on time and place, not just force you to be inconvenienced.  Personally, I don't deal with people who act sketchy, whether I'm buying or selling. It makes things a lot easier."
craigslist,3718ff,xxevil92xx,10,Sat May 23 22:35:09 2015 UTC,You'd basically just be acting like the trashy assholes that craiglist is notoriously known for. Why the hell would you want to do that?
craigslist,3718ff,midwestcreative,3,Sun May 24 03:25:48 2015 UTC,You are right. Sounds like a waste of time. Life is more precious than wasting time on trying to scam a lawbeller. Thanks.
craigslist,3718ff,midwestcreative,2,Sun May 24 03:45:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I know it's frustrating, but lowballing is a pretty normal part of business. They aren't being rude by doing that. If you're not getting what you want out of it, just try ebay instead, but sometimes stuff just isn't worth what you wish it was too."
craigslist,3718ff,lexpython,1 point,Sun May 24 03:54:43 2015 UTC,"Lowballers suck, for sure, but being an asshole to them just makes the world worse.  I usually just send them dick pix.  Just kidding, I've never done that, but it would be funny!"
craigslist,3718ff,Its_Not_My_Blood,1 point,Sun May 24 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of people that sell on Craigslist are willing to negotiate on the price, so you shouldn't let yourself get upset about people making offers. It's only in their own interest to see if you will take less. Just state that you are firm on the price. They might just be willing to go though with the deal."
craigslist,3718ff,beardedheathen,1 point,Sun May 24 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"or offer a different price. Part of selling on craigslist is haggling. If you aren't interested in that put ""price is firm"" or something similar in your listing."

craigslist,36wo2m,clwerf,1 point,Fri May 22 19:04:19 2015 UTC,"I think you answered the question yourself. I'm not sure if I would call it a double standard, but if you pay for an ad, CL will scrutinize your ad less and decide for themselves whether the ad should stay up or not.   My real question is, why are you searching for ""arabic navy funeral""?"
craigslist,36wo2m,rebu_auschwitz,1 point,Fri May 22 21:11:55 2015 UTC,":-)  That was merely an illustration to show how awful it is.  You get the same results with punjabi best buy  Back in the real world, I don't want to search for ""French"" and then get hit with the same 30 postings for a job at some car dealership (which does not involve French, best buy, or a navy funeral).  And clicking boxes for individual job fields does not help, because there are legit sales jobs which could involve German, etc.  (Btw I also understand that Spanish is a different matter altogether, given it's Texas.)  As for the double standard, there's nothing on CL that says that paid ads can appear more often than 48 hours.  (Though the misleading 8-point keyword spam is arguably the bigger problem.)  If this egregious spamming does happen elsewhere and is countenanced by CL, please let me know.  But I've checked probably 30 metros and never seen anything like it."

craigslist,36kvfh,Aduialion,4,Wed May 20 12:04:00 2015 UTC,"I sell frequently. So many awkward scheduling conflicts. Honestly, the first person able to come, pay asking price or close, and take it away has always been the best.    For me the dilemma is dealing with very small time frames, like one person wants to come at 5, another at 6. The 5pm person shows up late and the 6pm people are there. Also the 5pm person had to drive 1.5 hours each way.    It sucks to deal with but I expect to be on time or communicate changes. I expect that of myself. It makes buying and selling things so much easier.    I don't want to waste a Sunday killing my morning bc someone said 10am, reschedule to 12, shows up at 12:30.  But, for people that don't sell things often I'd say be forthcoming, but do what feels right for you. That bit of money doesn't feel worth much after dealing with people getting pissed around you."

I've been selling on Craigslist and other non auction type places for years, I know better.    For me it's always who can pick up first.   There's nothing wrong with it.  When I see something I want, I tell them I can pick up asap.  If I can't pick it up with in the same day I comment, I don't comment.   Because nothing is worse than waiting 3 or 4 days because they were first to comment and then they change their mind during that time."

craigslist,35sw53,Casemods,5,Wed May 13 06:17:57 2015 UTC,5 hours of your time and 30-40 in gas? $100 minimum.
craigslist,35sw53,8lue,2,Wed May 13 06:31:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks. $100 feels like the right low-end to me, too. I was timid to suggest such a high number (relative to the cost of the $200 chairs) because of the possibility of sticker shock souring the deal. I'm glad my intuition was in the right ballpark.  I figure gas will be $40, and then there's my time. I have no idea how to quantify this, but want to be fairly compensated (I've been too generous with this in the past). If I were doing freelance photography I'd charge $20-$25/hr. If I were writing I'd probably take work for $10/hr. If I were appraising antiques I'd ask for $75/hr. If I were making more money on this deal I'd do it for free.  Think I'm in a position to say my time is worth $15/hr and ask for a $130 delivery fee, or would that come across as too money-grubbing? Is $100 the right number to toss out?"

I find those people are usually the ""flippers"" that offer a really low price just to turn around and sell it for a profit. These are what I call bottom feeders.   To avoid these scumbags, mention in your ad that you are open to offers and that you wont respond to price inquiries - anyone who wants it and it serious will make a cash offer.  I ignore anyone asking ""how much""  Most of these responses are probably bots too. But more likely just bottom feeders.   I find its better to ignore all emails and just update the ad to cover any questions. That will make it easy to filter through people who don't read or bots/automated messages"

What you might want to consider, for future transactions, is that when you advertise an item on Craigslist, you need to expect people from all walks and styles of life. In other words, just because they showed up in long white T-shirts, baggy pants, boxers exposed, etc, doesn't mitigate that bad things will happen to you. Stop being stereotypical.   Also, if dealing with the outside public in this manner is uncomfortable, perhaps you should meet potential buyers in public or have a buddy system set up at your place.

craigslist,3486ae,kickstand,2,Wed Apr 29 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"I bought and sold about a dozen cars off of Craig's list over the last two years.  Let me tell you first hand.  The sub $3k used car market is brutal.  You got two things goes on.  You have people selling end of the life junk and people selling good cars for cheap because that's all they can get.  First off, deal with smart nice people.  They tend to take care of their cars and get work done as needed.  Avoid ads that say ""getting rid off"".   Instead look for ads that tells a story of an owner that generally care about the car.  They should be willing to tell you the history of it.  The right seller will enjoy talking about the car.  They may even show a level of sadness of selling it.  Deal with only these folks. This tip alone will get you very far towards finding a good car.  Bad ad http://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/5001948700.html  A good ad http://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/4969117899.html  The most important thing is undetstand how they drove it.  Let them drive it for it a bit.  If they gun the gas, rev it when it's cold, crank the wheel without moving, you're going to have problems.    The kid I bought my '04 GTO from turned the wheel while parked, now I'm having to replace the complete power steering system because of leaks.  My sister drove hard around corners and blew the suspension joints out.  If they try to throw you off for any reason, respectfully run away.  When you see the car, looks for uneven gaps between fenders and doors. These are signs of a poor repaired wreck. Look for hack job on the wiring.  If the engine is dirty, they never took car of it.  Pull the oil cap.  Look inside of it for build up.  If you see what looks like chocolate milk, there's water in the engine.  Run. Listen for noises in the engine.  If your feeling risky pop the radiator cap just a little.  It should push back, but don't open it all the way.  When driving check that it steers straight, makes smooths turns, and shocks work well.  Play with knobs.  See if you fit.    If you like it, there are mechanics that will inspect cars on site.  Generally we can find everything wrong with a car in about 10 minutes.  Edit: Didn't notice the airbags were deployed on the bad car ad.  I was just looking at the words.  I guess that proves my point."

Only real advice I have based on experience, will generally be honest and take low-balls and obo's to pay tuition and rent etc.   Another trick I've learned is to set up with a local car shop that does free inspections so when you do your test drive let the person know you want to take it to the mechanic and most people with a legitimate history and truthful status on the car are fine with it, obviously people who know their car is going to come up a bit negative than what was advertised to you will be a bit objective to it."

craigslist,3486ae,Its_Not_My_Blood,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"What I did when I was looking for my first car last year:   Don't scoop up the first thing that's within your price range, be patient, if possible. Look for something that's a bit under your price range, allows you some money to fix things if necessary. Compare their asking price to the Kelley Blue Book value. If the list price is way lower than the expected value, chances are there's something wrong with it. Or would you be overpaying for what the car is worth? Kelley Blue Book will also give you the expected mileage on the car, based on its age. This can give you a clue if the car's been driven into the ground by previous owners. Think about what's most important to you. Are you worried about gas mileage? Do you need/want a truck for anything?    And then I'll just echo what everyone else has said. Look at what the best used car options are. Absolutely take it for a test drive and get a mechanic to check it out, if possible. If you aren't able to take it to a mechanic, ask one what to look for. And yeah, sure, it's cliche, but trust your gut. If you get a feeling the owner isn't trustworthy, go with it.  I spent a few months looking and was able to get a 2001 Ford Taurus for $2000 from a guy who was moving across the country and didn't want to take it with him. It's only been 7 months, but it's still going strong and I'm pretty happy with it.  Sorry that got really long, but maybe it can help you. Good luck!"
craigslist,3470cv,letschou,2,Tue Apr 28 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"I bought my car on craigslist about 5 years ago. Bring someone who knows something about cars/a mechanic if you can manage it. Try all of the knobs and buttons, open the trunk and all of the windows, check for a spare tire/jack, try the AC and stereo, listen for any funny noises while test driving/making turns/idling/breaking. Request paperwork from their mechanic, proof of repairs and maintenance. Don't go alone and don't meet at your house. Meet somewhere with cameras like a bank parking lot or similar. Be aware. I don't want to sound paranoid but you need to be smart, not everyone is as trustworthy as you would like them to be. It can be a great decision as long as you are smart about it."

If you have all highways drives, a regular engine would be fine, as long as it's not a huge SUV. A small, economical Japanese car is your best bet. Honda, Subaru, Toyota. Very reliable and cheap to maintain.  Around 10K, you should find cars under 100k miles easy. If you're spending $10k on a car with 200k miles, I'd stay away."

In my experience on Craigslist in northern, NJ the people browsing the free section are the worst. I have put up curb alert items in the past as I don't want to deal with the retards and time-waster in person, only to keep getting the posts flagged enough to get taken down repeatedly. When I posted about it in a related craigslist forum, the forumers there said craigslisters don't like curb alerts because the free item could be gone. I said that is messed up, since they don't have to come, if they live far don't come, simple, don't flag my legitimate free ad. They replied, well that is what the userbase wants so that is how it is. Which sucks because the userbase is often so stupid that even though I always list my relative address(my town and county) in every listing and sale I often get caught up in long exchanges only for the imbecile to reveal they live 50+ miles away after 10 or so total back and forth emails since they never looked up my address and of course they will never come. I have had similar bad experiences with my local freecycle. This time wasting woman kept messaging me that she was interested in an item and always flaked on picking up: ""Oh I cannot come Tuesday like I said earlier, there is a football game I really want to see.""   People are just assholes in general these days, it is not just Craigslist, our societal framework creates these assholes who say they are gonna do something, but never do. In theory craigslist could be great, but with a population full of assholes selling or getting rid of anything requires a time investment almost akin to working at your job. Only on ebay where your reputation will be ruined, can such assholes be curbed, but unfortunately I don't want to deal with the hassle of shipping."

A guy comes to pick up your item, you give him the item AND some money!  *edit: generally the check they send appears to be a bank check, so your bank will credit your account immediately.

craigslist,336d7z,unique616,0,Mon Apr 20 03:40:11 2015 UTC,"The reason craigslist is in a downward spiral, is because they have no interest in maintaining real classified sites.   They are only interested in having the appearance of a classified site. Any other site, with their traffic and free listings would have explosive growth. They would be the biggest commerce site on the internet.   Craigslist has always been more interested in restricting and clamping down on users, than providing a valuable service. This is why there are few listings in most categories, and even fewer buyers.   Free listings in most categories and the number of craigslist listings is approximately 3% of eBay's listings.   The craigslist ""execs""/staff are the biggest bufoons on the internet. The sooner craigslist collapses the better. They represent everything that is wrong with the internet. Nothing more than self serving pigs."

Also, I don't know what market you live in, but here in the Washington DC area there are no shortage of real posts. I bought my last 2 cars and motorcycle off CL.  What personal interest do you have in CL failing? It seems you have some sort of personal vendetta against them."

I don't have any problem with competition. It's good for everyone. Hell, there's a million other websites where you can buy and sell stuff, they just aren't as ubiquitous as CL. I do personally take issue with Facebook specifically. They know enough about everyone's personal life; I don't think it's a good idea that they know who's buying what from whom.

But I don't disagree with what you are saying. The ONLY reason I use facebook is to buy and sell on their groups. I don't use my real name on facebook. Never have. Most likely, never will.   So why the big attraction with facebook? Craigslist sales just died. Like 1 or 2 sales every three months. And it seems craigslist does nothing but restrict and work against their users. Arrogant Assholes pretty much sums it up.  Started listing on facebook groups and had 2 sales the first day. New audience. Many who will have nothing to do with craigslist.  Ebay has the same problem. Jerked so many sellers around for so many years, they forgot that a lot of those sellers were some of their biggest buyers.

But u can repost them.   Thats about the extent of how terrible craigslist as a website is for me.   The problem with craigslist is mostly the users. Flakes, weirdos, and douchy trying to scam.

Listing items at GIVE AWAY prices and they sit for weeks without a single response.   I don't care if craigslist survives or not. They are next to useless for me. I havn't bought or sold more than a few items in months.   Craigslist ""shits in everyone's cereal"" everytime they block/delete legitimate ads. If you havn't had legitimate ads blocked or flagged off, most likely you don't post more than a few ads on craigslist every month/year.  Kind of strange since it costs pennies to store and deliver thousands of ads. Craigslist looks like an active site until you notice 90% of craigslist free listings are the same crap posted over and over for months. Few people even look at craigslist when they are shopping for used items. They've learned from experience the chances are nil to none they will find anything.  Craigslist is dying."

That is communicating and try to negotiate vs just pretend like that didn't realize they don't have the money.    Story time: I like to clean up furniture and resell it on craigslist. I had a small credenza up. A person from far away wanted it. Set up a time for them to come over on Thursday. 15 mins prior they decide to call because they haven't left. It's a two hour drive for them and should have called two hours before. Reschedule to Saturday. They call an hour befire, going to be an hour late. Show up an extra 15 mins late. Tries to ask for $200 off.  The best part for me was giving her a death stare and a strong ""No."" Each time she tried to negotiate. 200 less, No, 100, No, 50, No, 20. No, 10, No. She gives me an envelope with the money. Don't try to negotiate if you waste someone's time.    Usually though prices are negotiable. My furniture isn't perfect, but there are many people insterested. I build this into the price. Taking $50 off isn't a huge deal, but if three people want it I'll stick to the asking price or only go down 20-40 to help speed things along. Not trying to get high retail price for what the piece is worth actually. Just what it will sell easily in a week.    /rant"

craigslist,3289v7,peaheezy,2,Sat Apr 11 13:48:57 2015 UTC,"It's very viable. I know people who have furnished entire houses for almost nothing from craigslist. Just use common sense and trust your intuitions about it when shopping. Have them plug it in and show you it works. Skip it if something seems shady, etc.   If you're talking just a basic fridge and stove, just go through the free section, or make really low offers on people selling. If you're wanting something higher grade where you're spending a significant amount, I'd be much more careful and I wouldn't do it unless you trust that you have a good instinct for people."
craigslist,3289v7,midwestcreative,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"I've bought dishwashers, stoves, microwaves, refrigerators, washer and dryers on Craigslist.  A few tips:  1) Ask them how old it is and/or ask them for the model number so you can look up the age of the appliance.  Before you even go look at it you can figure out how used it is -- which should give you a good idea of its expected longevity now that you're buying it.  2) Try to figure out why they are selling it.  I like when they say ""we're just selling this because we are getting new appliances and this one doesn't match.""  It indicates that the appliance is in good shape -- they're not selling it because it has problems.  3) You can get a cheap fridge depending on how long it needs to last.  You can probably get a newer fridge in really good condition for $400-$500 or a sort of older, shittier one for $150 or so.  If you need it for a few years and want to make sure it's not going to have problems, spend the money (and you're probably paying half price or less compared to a new one still.  3) Remember that if/when you need to move, you can likely re-sell these again and get some money back."

craigslist,31kbsi,disgustipated,0,Mon Apr 6 13:54:45 2015 UTC,"Scam. They always use random words in the title and the ad, the price is always some random number like  ""$2965"" (a number no real person is actually going to ask for their car) the price will be entirely too low, and the phone number is usually out of state or there is some email for contact. Flag those ads please for the sake of the people who don't know there are pieces of human trash on Craigslist who want to scam them. Or contact them, deliberately waste their time, and have fun with it. I have an archive of emails and texts of when I waste these idiots time. Priceless"

I haven't heard of VRC before, but googling brought me to http://www.vericoin.info/ which seems like a likely candidate for what the Craigslist seller was referencing.   There are next to no valid reasons for a seller not to accept cash, even if it isn't their primary desired form of payment. Craigslist has a good page describing common scamming techniques, which you can find here.  If you're ever skeptical about something seeming TGTBT, just ask if you can check out the product before you purchase it. Most sellers with nothing to hide won't hesitate to let you do so, especially if the product is expensive."

craigslist,30bjvg,whatevermansure,8,Thu Mar 26 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"Posted prices are meaningless on craigslist. Doesn't matter what price you post. 99% of the time the only responses you get are from lowballers looking for hand outs.  You want to find good deals on craigslist? Try making offers that make it worth the sellers time. Most people don't bother with garage sales. They have better things to do than waste their time selling items at pennies on the dollar.  If the best price you find on an item is $50 on eBay, how cheap do you think it should be on craigslist? Most craigslist buyers seem to think $50 eBay items should sell for $20 or less on craigslist. Most sellers have better things to do with their time."
craigslist,30bjvg,shellysum,-12,Thu Mar 26 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"I guess I thought craigslist was for people to sell off stuff they didn't want anymore. But that makes sense now, it's been infected with people wanting to make money. Same thing thru happened to Ebay and why it's so hard to find good deals.anymore. You people suck."
craigslist,30bjvg,shellysum,9,Thu Mar 26 02:37:00 2015 UTC,"You remind me of a guy who complained every day about DVDs being overpriced on craigslist.   DVDs were selling for $2 and $3 and he was unhappy because no one would sell to him for $1 each.  I ask him, ""How many DVDs have you listed and sold on craigslist for $1 each?"" Big surprise. No answer. Never heard from him again.  A lot of these buyers refuse to pay the market or going price because they are looking to buy and resell at a profit. Or as you put it, ""craigslist is infected with people wanting to make money.""  One thing you should consider. If I'm looking for a quick sale at low ball or give away prices, I don't need to waste time waiting on craigslist lowballers. I can sell bulk loads to pawn shops and dealers within minutes."
craigslist,30bjvg,Aduialion,6,Thu Mar 26 08:18:56 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're expectations of CL are incorrect. CL is not amazon at garage sell prices. you want something specific, and in a certain guaranteed condition. CL is a crap shoot for that. If you are patient you might find it at the price you want. If you're more flexible you'll find a deal more easily."
craigslist,30bjvg,nubi78,4,Thu Mar 26 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"I've bought and sold on CL.  My opinion on buying so far has been pretty good so long as you adhere to the basic rules of buying.  The prices have been what I expected.     Selling has been a disappointment... Most people who sound interested don't bother getting back to you or say they will meet and never show.  After a few no shows, I felt that making $15-20 on an item was not worth the gas/time to mess with the hassle.    I tend to not look at CL much any more for these reason... So I would not call CL a ripoff but more of a white trash haven."

craigslist,2zw3cg,craigslist_slut,2,Sun Mar 22 10:24:57 2015 UTC,"Some of my ads get automatically flagged and i don't know why.  It's a relatively new thing,  started maybe a year or two ago.   Just write a whole new one,  and the save the other for another day.  I've had some be auto flagged, and then three months later it works again.   Happy fucking!"
craigslist,2zw3cg,coprolaliast,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:56:21 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain.. but hang in there.  There area a couple of things to consider.... CL flags as a community and as CL itself. These are distinct. I have had ads up for 5-7 days, only to get flagged down after. You get an email saying your ad is flagged. This is due to people flagging it (I do not flag myself for other reasons). Anyways. I have 10-15 ads up at any given time. Post them from different email accounts at different times, preferable from different IP locations and in different categories. Eventually they will expire, DON'T renew them all at the same time, but at strategic times around lunch, after work, late at night.  The second category baffles me, that is when CL itself flags you. Symptom of this is when you do not get an email at all when the ad is flagged. You will not be notified, only when you go check on your ad with the admin link you will see it was flagged down. The odd thing is this happens once in a while and I can not find rhyme or reason. One hallmarks is that sometimes CL asks for a phone nr. I have like 10 GV numbers I use so I have plenty. Mostlty they go through fine, but with ads that get flagged I noticed that I always had to do the voice thing. It's soooo odd.. I have some out there ads up that didn't need verificiation but write an innocous sounding one, without 'example' pics and need to do the phone thing and oddly, it gets shut down. When I now get the voice verification thing I kinda know that it's a lost ad...  It's a game of attrition. Think human sexuality. We men are expendable.. we are too plenty, want too often.. are too 'available' our mating strategy is to shoot tons of sperm at just one egg. That means you got to do that to CL as well. You need to keep a good line of ads up. I have numerous, white collar, blue collar flavoured, short, lenghty, funny etc etc.. to appeal to a wider range of women.  Hang in there, it does work. I have a whole system setup too where I can just copy paste my way through the initial email correspondence with people who respond. It takes me no time at all, but it did take me time to setup.  I meet different women about 1x a month or so.   My advise, if the mood is right, go for it, you need to do your thing right off, chances of seeing each other again are slim. Just be honest, polite and a bit insistent... mostly it will work.. if your date wants to see you again that's a bonus...  I usually don't see them again for fear of them becoming attached since I am a normal, sane, interesting guy not to tout my own horn and that I want to keep it on the d/l."

I rely on my phone heavily for work and just in general so I was panicking - I felt stupid - was wary of buying used again and ready to just go to Best Buy and drop $500 or so on a brand new one.   In a stroke of luck - my local Best Buy didn't have the lower GB models on hand so I retreated back to my car and continued doing more research on how to fix it. Eventually, I stumble across a forum that says that if the phone is still covered by the Apple warranty (1 year standard comes with it) I can just take it to the Apple store and they will replace it if after their tests they find they cant repair it.  I used this website to check it and luckily enough the warranty was still in effect: https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do  I walked into the apple store and told them that out of nowhere my service was not working. I told them that I got a new simcard and it did nothing - this is important - if you didn't do this they will likely tell you to take it up with your provider. They asked me where I got it and I did tell them I bought it used. However, I did not tell them about calling T-mobile and what they said to me about the payments, just to be safe- I'm not sure if theyd replace my phone if they knew that. This may be a bit morally reprehensible but to each his own. I  Walked out with a new phone in less than 20 minutes and saved myself about $500 buying a new one from the store.   I know our situation differs in a few ways but I still hope this can help you in some way"

craigslist,2zldl7,Veerapriya,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:32:20 2015 UTC,Great. What could be improved to make your selling experience better?
craigslist,2zldl7,isabob,-1,Thu Mar 19 19:21:55 2015 UTC,"It's not a real classifieds site. Most people don't realize it's a scam.  A real classifieds site with free listings would have billions of listings. Ebay has 1.5 billion+ paid listings per month. Craigslist has 20 to 30 million (less than 5% of eBay listings).  Usability? ...Most people find craigslist next to useless. It looks like an active classifieds site until you take a closer look and start following the listings.   Most of those listings have been posted for months. There's not a lot of buyers because most people no longer bother with craigslist. If they are looking for a specific item (a specific book title, movie title, tool, auto parts, clothing in their size, etc.) the chances that they will find it on craigslist is nil to none.  This is a site with FREE listings, and your chances of finding something you actually need, is no better than neighborhood yard sales. It's laughable.   Free listings for businesses, dealers, and private parties and craigslist limits their users to offering little more than garage sales.  Phone verification, ghosting, blocking, flagging. Craigslist is a malfunctioning wreck by design. It's a scam. The biggest farce you will find online."
craigslist,2zldl7,MonkyThrowPoop,-1,Thu Mar 19 19:31:42 2015 UTC,I don't understand.  Who is scamming who?  Are you saying that craigslist is being paid by businesses to put their ads up and take down competitive ones by general users?
craigslist,2zldl7,shellysum,0,Thu Mar 19 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"Read his/her post. No one has to ""pay"" to have competitive ads taken down. Phone verification, flagging and blocking is enough to make craigslist a useless shit hole."

craigslist,2zldl7,operaman5000,-1,Thu Mar 19 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"Man, you guys must have had some bad experiences on there.  I've bought maybe 20-30 things on craigslist, only sold 2-3 things, but have never had a problem.  Other than one dude who, after agreeing on a price and time for pickup, sold a couch an hour before my moving guys were going to show up for it.  I think a lot of it depends on how good you are at adjusting the search (using """"s and -s), what you're looking for, and how patient you are looking through the listings, almost like an online Salvation Army store. Only thing I can say about the website is that it crashes the web browsing app on my phone when I try to use their website on it, so that sucks.  I had to download an app for it, which is actually better."

I dealt with that a couple times so now I only meet people 2 minutes away from my house in a public place, so problem mostly solved. If they're late or a no-show with no communication, I go home and ignore them. Since then I have the new weirdness of people agreeing to one price, then when they arrive they complain that it took longer than expected for them to travel so now they want a lesser price. I'm not sure if craigslist is a microcosm of our culture as a whole or if its just sort of a magnet for wacky self-involved people."

craigslist,2z74ux,lycore,3,Mon Mar 16 03:53:31 2015 UTC,"Two Problems  1) You are very limited to the amount of items you can list. I can usually list about 10 items before items are blocked or I get constant phone verification.   2) Yes, I list all my items below eBay prices. About 2/3 of the lowest eBay price. ($60 eBay / I list for $40 on craigslist). Still not enough for most craigslist buyers. They will normally offer about 1/2 the listed priced ($20 for item listed for $40 on craigslist / $60 on eBay)   Craigslist is not a big part of my online selling. I started listing at eBay prices again and get a few sales every couple months. Discounting items well below eBay prices didn't help (atleast for me).   Very much like garage/yard sales. Too much time and effort to sell $10/$40 items for 50¢/$1.00   I agree. The selection is poor. Mostly the same items listed every week. I could list hundreds of items, but craigslist isn't set up that way."
craigslist,2z74ux,tedshony,6,Mon Mar 16 22:48:43 2015 UTC,What irks me about CL is that people think that if they paid $100 for something that it's worth $100. NO it's not. As soon as it comes out of the wrapper it's worth at least 30% less. Why should I pay retail for a used item?
craigslist,2z74ux,Ferrisprost,3,Mon Mar 16 12:04:26 2015 UTC,I have a friend that is constantly selling used items on CL. He and his father clean stuff up very well. If it cleans up decently they always call the items new. It drives me nuts.
craigslist,2z74ux,ucanthandlethetruff,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:26:33 2015 UTC,I've noticed this with a few items as well. It also depends on how big of a city you live in.
craigslist,2z74ux,had0ukenn,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"Craigslist could be huge. Free listings and look at the pathetic amount of listings they have (less than 5% of eBay listings).
