Onodera,3dnkxx,Koutte,5,Fri Jul 17 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. If Komi was influenced by the polls, then Kosaki would have been a more centered part of the story after the first poll. Instead, he did the opposite so no. I find it hard to believe he cares about the polls."
Onodera,3dnkxx,hak091,6,Fri Jul 17 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"As much as I wish for Kosaki to win, she doesn't stand a chance against chitoge. I doubt the polls or anything for that matter would change the inevitable ChitogexRaku ending.  Onodera is very popular, rivalling Chitoge's popularity and is debatably more popular, which really is a big achievement since she ain't the main heroine. So I hope that Komi respects that fact and atleast gives her somewhat of a happy ending and tries to please the fans, which he has shown through allowing Kosaki to be the MC of her own spinoff."
Onodera,3dnkxx,Hazonskie,2,Sat Jul 18 04:56:00 2015 UTC,Maybe? I've got the feeling Komi has big plans for Kosaki and that's why he doesn't focus on her so much because the best always comes last (or at least I hope so). I mean most of us didn't saw the Christmas chapter coming.
Onodera,3dnkxx,Opal158,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:23:05 2015 UTC,"Well, since you made mention of the last chapter. I might as well share what I think might happen. I think Komi already had his ending girl from the moment he made the one-shot of Nisekoi. It probably didn't play out as how it was depicted in the one-shot, but so far it's still leaning to the main heroine end. And the latest chapter might be a flag for ships to start sinking. It might not immediately happen but it's possible. Like Raku will one-by-one reject the heroines.  Nonetheless, as an Onodera supporter I won't lose hope until the end. :)"

Onodera,3b5riv,railwarrior,2,Fri Jun 26 19:25:09 2015 UTC,"Damn, shame that it has to be redone. Oh well, these things happen.  Some advice going into Sunday's re-vote: Kosaki's chances of winning go up if we don't vote for Yukinoshita and Shiro, since, like Kosaki, they won the previous 7 rounds and their statistical totals (which I don't fully understand) are highest. In fact, Shiro got ~1000 more votes than Kosaki in a previous round that allowed the top 2 (Shiro and Kosaki) to advance, so this is a big deal.   Worst-case scenario, Shiro and Yukinoshita will win, so we need to take every precaution to ensure Kosaki advances. I myself also like OreGairu and find Yukinoshita to be an interesting character, but I won't be voting for her come Sunday because Kosaki winning is priority #1."
Onodera,3b5riv,Intrepid11,2,Fri Jun 26 22:50:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are right. To put it in simple terms. JUST vote ONLY for ONODERA and no one else. Regardless of having interests in her competitors. Haha"

Onodera,39w6hd,Epan1216,5,Mon Jun 15 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"What would you like to see in future episodes/chapters with Onodera (date at amusement park, another beach episode, Raku & Onodera stranded on an island,etc.)"
Onodera,39w6hd,hak091,4,Mon Jun 15 08:12:22 2015 UTC,"An amnesia episode where she still retains her talent for decorating food, but also gains the ability to make it super tasty as well. Mamadera needs Kosaki to tend to the store while she runs an errand so she calls Raku again to help out explaining the situation to him.   Raku is good guy as always and compliments Kosaki's sweets.  Kosaki is shy as usual, but at the end of the day confesses to Raku. She goes in for a kiss, but he stops it and Haru + Mamadera shortly walk in on them.  Day ends Kosaki faints for some random reason and wakes up 1 hour later, with her memories back plus still remembering the confession. When confronted by Raku, however, she pretends she knew nothing and he talks about what happened during the time of her amnesia-- not mentioning the confession. Kosaki just listens and nods, and comments with an important detail from that amnesia time that she was supposed to hide. Raku doesn't pay attention to it at first, but after he leaves their shop he  has second thoughts and ponders whether she actually remembered or not --> episode end  (future episode maybe raku confronts kosaki a second time about that day and she actually confesses ;_;)"
Onodera,39w6hd,Ailim,3,Mon Jun 15 08:39:08 2015 UTC,"why not do all the things you mentioned in to one arc    (date at amusement park, another beach episode, Raku & Onodera stranded on an island,etc.)   Instead of having Haru forcing them to go on a date just so she can get a ""teddy bear"". let's have one of them actually have the courage to go up to on another and asks for a date. Raku decides on a place that they should both meet up so he decided on an amusement park they enjoy themselves until 12:00PM and Raku decides to go on a tropical island because he thought that a regular beach isn't good enough. He wanted to have more of a meaning with Kosaki than just walking along the shore of a regular beach. They take a boat there and there were lots of people as well because the tropical island is a tour site in Bonyari (the prefecture in Japan that the author has made up) enjoys their rest of their time on the island (This can be treated as a beach episode without the harem). They enjoyed a bit too much forgetting that the boat will have there last time to leave the island. They didn't make it in time thus being stranded on an island. They both try to figure out a way to get out of the island before its too late at night. They weren't able to due to a lack of materials/resources on the island Raku decides that they should spend the night on the island. Kosaki agrees with him. They both start talking. They talked for hours. Then suddenly the conversation kinda died down leaving a long silence. They both decide that it was too silent so they tried to talk again but they just interrupted each other Raku being a gentleman at times let's Kosaki speak first. Kosaki gets all shy and blushy she confesses to Raku. Raku being in shock and told Kosaki that he was about to say the same thing to her. Which leads them talking again. Time passes they were waiting for the morning boat to come and go back but this time they were both even happier than before.   TL;DR Both of them Have fun in the amusement park for the first half of the day goes to an island the second half of the day. Forgot the last ride home. Stranded on an island Kosaki confesses and Happy ending."
Onodera,39w6hd,Areselia,2,Mon Jun 15 09:18:47 2015 UTC,"One thing that I hope Komi does, is for her to have the spotlight during the next school festival arc.   The first year, she sprained her ankle and couldn't play Juliet.  Second year, she barely lost to Haru (that wedding dress was too strong).  I hope Komi gives her a good memory like she wanted in the first year, not a cop-out."

Onodera,39w6hd,erosa63,3,Mon Jun 15 08:50:11 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much a three way tie with these:  I really like the vector work on this one, especially Kosaki's expression and the background color in the source. This is my current desktop and will likely remain so. (Source)  Kosaki looks great in this nightgown. Some people would say she looks too plain, but I think she looks beautiful in it.  I always liked this image for some reason. I liked Kosaki's expression here, almost as if she is breaking the fourth wall and telling us that she has a secret that she's keeping from Raku, likely her crush. It could also be just her and Raku, and she's winking at him, as if she's hinting her feelings to him from the safety of being turned away from him. I also liked the quote there, ""Falling in love means...becoming more sensitive"". I feel like I understand if I don't think about it too hard, but I don't really get it, since Raku and Kosaki are already sensitive people to begin with. Perhaps someone else has a perspective on it?"

Onodera,39w6hd,Intrepid11,6,Mon Jun 15 08:12:13 2015 UTC,"I want to say everything, but I feel that's pretty half-assed.  I guess three qualities that really appeal to me would be  Understanding   I both love and dislike this part about her. On one hand she's always empathizing and considerate, but on the other it sometimes holds her back from putting herself forward to Raku.   Quirkiness   Who doesn't love this about her!? Personally I think it makes her really adorable.   Her smile   It can put anyone's heart at ease. Warm, sincere, and extremely adorable"
Onodera,39w6hd,Areselia,9,Mon Jun 15 08:49:36 2015 UTC,tbh she looks and has the personality of an RL ideal girlfriend to me
Onodera,39w6hd,hak091,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:56:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously! A lot of people who don't like her say she's too plain, but I think it's more that she's the most realistic, which is the best!"

Onodera,39w6hd,Intrepid11,5,Tue Jun 16 07:01:25 2015 UTC,What's your favorite moment from the anime/manga?
Onodera,39w6hd,Epan1216,9,Mon Jun 15 08:12:18 2015 UTC,"From the anime:    when she gives the chocolate to Raku after a long day of failures    From the manga:    the recent Christmas chapter, won't say anything because spoilers"
Onodera,39w6hd,Epan1216,2,Mon Jun 15 08:42:11 2015 UTC,That Chirstmas arc wins it for me too because they finally got a little closer (after nearly 2 years in high school...).  Even Haru acknowledge it in a later chapter.
Onodera,39w6hd,KorStonesword,2,Mon Jun 15 12:21:34 2015 UTC,"I feel the same about the Christmas Arc, it is the best we have seen so far towards bringing Kosaki and Raku together. Unless one of them confesses or kisses the other, this arc can't be topped."

Onodera,38vh0y,Intrepid11,2,Sun Jun 7 10:27:11 2015 UTC,as far as i've seen from my laps around love live community. Nico is a love her or hate her character so Kosaki will likely get some for lack of a better expression.... fuck Nico votes.
Onodera,38vh0y,ravensshade,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"That's true, she definitely isn't as popular as Kotori or Rin. I was just figuring that series fans would vote for Nico anyway just because she represents Love Live.  In any case, Kosaki is very likely the most popular of the two and should still win just fine. The fact that Nisekoi currently has a second season helps as well."

Onodera,37wmiw,MOETORE,2,Sun May 31 00:40:09 2015 UTC,"This image shouldn't degrade since it's a PNG, which is a lossless file type. JPGs are lossy file types and compress every time they are saved, so the quality will go down(by a little or a lot). So you either saved it as a JPG, or you zoomed in past 100%"

Onodera,35pw7f,jshwrd89,6,Tue May 12 15:17:04 2015 UTC,No there definitely has been a severe lack of Kosaki/Haru. Rest assured the next 2 episodes should be guaranteed to be more enjoyable despite how I actually feel about the Haru introduction feeling like the most forced thing by Komi.  Now we just pray that we get some of the 'irrelevant' chapters adapted for us just like Marika did for a little extra screen time..
Onodera,35pw7f,TheStraggier,3,Tue May 12 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I look back at the screenshots from last season and there was WAY more good stuff by this time. Pretty disappointing really. I mean sure, I would love a Kosaki-centric episode, but it would be great if she was around more in these other episodes."
Onodera,35pw7f,MOETORE,2,Tue May 12 18:31:08 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. Hopefully the next is focused only on Kosaki, since every other main girl got their own episode.   Otherwise, Shaft will do a great job at trolling this sub."
Onodera,35pw7f,hak091,2,Tue May 12 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"It's true, but maybe that means she'll get a heavy amount of focus towards the end of the season :o  I'd be happy if we finish off strong with Raku x Onodera (kinda like last season)"
Onodera,35pw7f,Pause_,1 point,Tue May 12 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry,its not happening,be prepared for more Chitoge and more Haru"
Onodera,35pw7f,LoneWizzy,1 point,Wed May 13 10:03:30 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, I haven't read the manga, but I am pretty sure they just abandoned Kosaki :/. Really pisses me off as she was entirely the reason I watched season one."
Onodera,35pw7f,TheExpertCrafter,1 point,Wed May 13 15:15:25 2015 UTC,"it would be better if they just abandoned Kosaki...Mangaka did something worse,he keeps making Kosaki fillers where she gets 0 character development and destroys her already non-existent chance of being the end girl..."
Onodera,35pw7f,LoneWizzy,1 point,Wed May 13 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly am planning to watch back through season one, documenting which episodes primarily focused on her, and then will go back and watch those when I need some Kosaki in my life. It really pisses me off that the Mangaka is doing this to us :/."
Onodera,35pw7f,TheExpertCrafter,1 point,Thu May 14 12:10:11 2015 UTC,"There was a pretty good few episodes that involved Kosaki and ichijou in the last few weeks, when the went to the mall and lost the keys etc. Pretty enjoyable. Ended up just being larger filler though :("
Onodera,35pw7f,MARKRULZ1,1 point,Thu May 14 12:36:38 2015 UTC,"it's only been 5 episodes so hopefully the onodera girls get some more screentime since the other girls got their episodes. I wish this season wasn't only 12 episodes. From how I see it, it's only gonna be 1 arc for each girl the season."
Onodera,35pw7f,Pause_,1 point,Tue May 12 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"Only 12 episodes, that kinda sucks :("
Onodera,35pw7f,MOETORE,1 point,Wed May 13 09:05:15 2015 UTC,"Hm I didn't realize this season was only 12 episodes, I just assumed it would be 24. I guess we shouldn't expect too much Kosaki then  :/"
Onodera,35pw7f,MOETORE,3,Thu May 14 22:53:23 2015 UTC,I think last season was only supposed to be 12 and then they extended it for some reason. Maybe that will happen again?

Onodera,35n91d,Pause_,2,Mon May 11 22:43:56 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Just going to warn you though, there is a little bit of plastic you over her skirt that you have to wiggle a bit to get out. I struggled with it a bit and it kinda loosened her skirt, (If you know what I mean ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o).) I don't know if this is normal, or if I am just being a noob, but, heads up. (No aesthetic changes her skirt just wiggles a tiny bit when touched.)"
Onodera,35n91d,Pause_,1 point,Mon May 11 22:52:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I don't really have much experience with figures so hopefully I don't screw it up lol"
Onodera,35n91d,Pause_,1 point,Mon May 11 23:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this was my first figure, I was nervous as hell when I was removing that plastic."

Onodera,35iu7n,thegreatdante,1 point,Mon May 11 06:35:04 2015 UTC,ok i've been a pretty fervent fan'o'dera since i started watching nisekoi but tsugumi is becoming a really close second...  especially after seeing that wallpaper...
Onodera,35iu7n,LoneWizzy,2,Mon May 11 07:21:01 2015 UTC,"her face looks a little off in this one tho,:{"

Onodera,35cvrc,MOETORE,1 point,Sat May 9 03:37:23 2015 UTC,I think her ear looks weird.
Onodera,35cvrc,Dean_Pervert,1 point,Sat May 9 05:06:22 2015 UTC,looks like there are more than 1 hole in the ear

Onodera,35b4d3,wardaniel9,2,Fri May 8 17:15:59 2015 UTC,She was there! Hopefully next week we get the legitimate introduction.
