humor,3dimnd,laredk,6,Thu Jul 16 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"A Hutt would not be ""in the closet"" to begin with.   Similar to worms, Hutts were hermaphrodites which meant they had both male and female reproductive organs. One reason for this was because of their race's fertility rate being very low that was possibly a consequence of damage following the loss of their original homeworld of Varl. As a result of this, gender was more of a case of a Hutt's deliberate decision or a viewer's deduction. Often, Hutts carrying children were referred to as female, though it was entirely up to the Hutt in question as to if the distinction was accepted or not.   http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hutt"
