AncientCivilizations,3e04us,sirjuicybooty,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:06:56 2015 UTC,It's pretty obvious the civilization(s) before the incas was more advanced than our own. We have to let go the notion that we are the most advanced humans in our history.

As far as I know, it is extremely hard to cut granite with the tools the incas had. Everything I read mentions that it was basically impossible to shape those stones with the technology available to the incas. The video mentions that what the incas built was more aligned to what was to be expected, small stones with rough surfaces. Those larger monolithic stones were not only harder density, they were smooth and carved to fit perfectly with each other. Why I'm interested in reading the link u posted."
AncientCivilizations,3e04us,siriand,2,Tue Jul 21 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"It can be granite, but coarse grained granite which makes it easier to cut and shape.  The Inca also made use of andesite since it could be cut into slabs pretty easily. Most of the sidewalks in Cuzco during the 80s were paved with andesite slabs.  The quarry is also not a quarry like we would think. The stone was not cut off a rock face or detached from the bedrock. Most of the time stone was selected from rockfall, minimally dressed, and then sent to the construction site for final dressing for construction. Or boulders and stones already at the construction site were minimally moved and dressed accordingly for construction. Sometimes they did not have to transport large stones great distances like many people believe.  But please, do read the articles."

By 2,500 BC, the Akkadians, a Semitic-speaking people that dwelled north of the Sumerians, starting using cuneiform to write their own language.    This describes a 500 year period during which cuneiform transferred from Sumer to the neighbouring Akkadians. Can that really be called 'not long'?"

TheDvārakā [1] submergence - The ancient city mentioned in the epic Mahabharata tells the story of submergence of following catastrophes.  The Kumari Kandam [2] - The oral traditional accounts of Southern Indian communities (Tamil speaking people) tells the story of their ancestoral migration from southern parts of the country, which are now under sea, towards more northern parts in a process spanning many years.  These stories were studied by many people and this kind of claims were generally considered pseudo-scientific (possibly due to biases in research towards some prejudiced goals and bad reputation created by hoaxters like Erich Von Daniken)  But I have surveyed [3] with satellite pictures available on-line and infer that these accounts may have some truth, which need to be studied scientifically.  I welcome this study and glad to see that similar accounts are available from other parts of the world and slowly coming to light.

I highly suggest listening to the Joe Rogan Experience episodes on YouTube if this subject interests you. He talks a lot about the likelihood of lost civilizations due to this type of event.
AncientCivilizations,2tzh07,boydbd,3,Sat Feb 14 17:06:53 2015 UTC,thanks. I will have a look at it. Besides I have interest in the subject and I have seen not very popular cases near my home town -  link to my blog post  I have seen two temples excavated from underground which nobody knows from which age. Because such a catastrophic event were never recorded in local history (neither oral nor written). I was wondering then where is it coming from. Was their a big catastrophe not so long ago which wiped out the entire people of the place so that no body left to tell about it? If that why did anybody know about such an event happened.   Else if this was a remnant of an older settlement which is forgotten in time?
AncientCivilizations,2tzh07,anandmallaya,2,Sat Feb 14 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"Well I know very little about the subject, but according to Carlson and others like him, there was a massive catastrophic event at about 11,600 years ago (interestingly, the date that Plato gives for the sinking of Atlantis), that caused rapid temperature rise and glacial melting. This would have caused massive sea-level rise and would have quickly drowned huge areas of land.   Before this, the land mass of Southern India was much larger than today, due to sea-levels being hundreds of feet lower. Now, consider that most civilizations are built along coasts, and it's reasonable to assume that most ancient civilizations before this time would have been quickly covers by hundreds of feet of water."

There was a shot of him shooting very quickly at targets very far away. Also what about when he shot a pop can lid in the air? Is that not accuracy? Or how about when he shot an arrow that was flying straight for him and split it in half? If he had messed up the shot, or did multiple takes like the article claimed, he would be seriously injured. I had trouble believing the rest of the article after reading those first few, obviously BS paragraphs."
AncientCivilizations,2tu916,frostbiyt,4,Wed Jan 28 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"Just talking about the accuracy part, isn't accuracy less of a concern on a battlefield? My understanding was arrows were fired in large volleys in large arcs most of the time. That situation seems to favour being able to put as many arrows up as fast as possible, rather than trying to hit a single enemy soldier."
AncientCivilizations,2tu916,IronRule,8,Tue Jan 27 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"Not really. You have to think about how much draw weight war bows had (all these trick shot bows don't even come near!). You can't just quick draw a bow and fire an arrow every other second. That's not how it works.  You are right that arrows were mostly fired in volleys, but especially in siege situations that's not necessarily true. If your castle is being sieged you don't want to blindly shoot your finite ammunition to the enemy. They just pick them up and shoot them back or even wait until you are out of arrows.  So being able to shoot a war bow isn't enough, you also have to be able to accurately hit something with it, so you don't waste arrows in a siege situation.  So in the end it's a mixture of strength and accuracy. You don't have to shoot an arrow a second and you don't need to hit a penny at two hundred meters distance. But you need to be able to hold a drawn war bow for a few seconds (which is hard enough) and still fire it as intended (either on a target when close, or in the right angle when firing in a group at large distance)."

I learned on a 250 N (later 400 N) bow and even that takes some training and practise. On Wikipedia the estimates are as far up as 800 N for medieval english long bows. I don't think I could safely use one of those.  I don't know how the draw weight was for ancient bows, but at least from greek vase paintings they seem to be rather short, similar to asian style bows. I think the draw weights can go up to 500 N or so for these, but I am only familiar with western bows, so I am not sure."

Before the recovery of the Mary Rose, Count M. Mildmay Stayner, Recorder of the British Long Bow Society, estimated the bows of the Medieval period drew 90–110 pounds-force (400–490 newtons), maximum, and Mr. W.F. Paterson, Chairman of the Society of Archer-Antiquaries, believed the weapon had a supreme draw weight of only 80–90 lbf (360–400 N).  Other sources suggest significantly higher draw weights. The original draw forces of examples from the Mary Rose are estimated by Hardy at 150–160 lbf (670–710 N) at a 30-inch (76.2 cm) draw length; the full range of draw weights was between 100–185 lbf (440–820 N).  The 30-inch (76.2 cm) draw length was used because that is the length allowed by the arrows commonly found on the Mary Rose.

AncientCivilizations,2o9al5,hkdharmon,3,Thu Dec 4 13:52:46 2014 UTC,"This is very interesting, however, I find the linguistic links to non PIE languages (Japanese and Sioux) to be unlikely, though the links to PIE languages are cool. Maru is Japanese meaning ""circle"" not man or water, as in a ships round bulkheads. And there are literally hundreds of Native American languages, the fact that one has a word meaning water that sounds like m-n is not particularly noteworthy.  However, the connections between various PIE languages are pretty well known among linguists and can even be determined with Grimm's Law and Verner's Law between PIE roots and German.  I also have no doubt that ancient civilizations shared legends. We still do it today with Santa Clause/Sinterklass/Kriss Kringle etc.  I would love to see a similar work up between Manu, Noah, and Utnapishtim."

AncientCivilizations,2o9al5,ExpeditionOfOne,4,Thu Dec 4 17:31:13 2014 UTC,"Doesn't it seem more likely that these are stories of river flooding exaggerated through hundreds of generations of oral tradition rather than a reference to ONE catastrophic event that common ancestors shared?   Almost every early civilization began along a major river. Isn't it possible that at one point there was a large flood and it washed away an entire village. A survivor from that flood would say he had ""lost everything."" When he told this story to others it he might even paint the picture that his ""whole world was washed away.""   Take that story and play the Telephone game with it and it would probably turn into a story of how the world was flooded. Now play the Telephone game for thousands of years before it is written down, and you have the story of Noah and Manu.  Isn't that the most likely scenario?"

AncientCivilizations,2n7sjx,Kingofqueenanne,-4,Mon Nov 24 05:33:30 2014 UTC,"But that's literally socialism, with an authoritarian twist at the end..."
AncientCivilizations,2n7sjx,anonagent,9,Mon Nov 24 05:46:49 2014 UTC,"Socialism is a modern concept that emerged in the 19th century, predicated on the existence of capital. If you don't know what capital is, then you won't understand why even the concept of socialism was impossible 11 kYa.  Socialism is not whatever you've been told it is if you can look at Neolithic pastoralists and call their living socialistic. In fact, the main thing that makes this impossible is the clear lack of even an idea of personal property ownership, that likely extended even to family members at the time. In other words, we're talking about people that didn't even sell their daughters off for marriage or have any social distinctions created by the accumulation of wealth at all.  For there to be Socialism, there first must be the establishment of industrial society. The idea's only about 200 years old, and that's being favorable. Socialism involves a state that allows the people to own the means of production indirectly, in preparation for a theoretical final leveling by Communism, capital-C. In truth, we now live in not only a post-industrial, but a post-consumer First World, and this means you would have at least thousands of pages to read to understand anything about what socialism actually is in this day and age.  I'm a history teacher. Hope this helps your understanding."
AncientCivilizations,2n7sjx,PaterTemporalis,1 point,Mon Nov 24 10:15:09 2014 UTC,Socialism makes sense in the Roman world. They had an industrial society with clear ownership.  It's fair to call the Gracchan revolution socialist leaning.
AncientCivilizations,2n7sjx,randomfact8472,3,Mon Nov 24 20:06:40 2014 UTC,"I find this article's title in particular to be disingenuous. When speaking about prehistory, you have to have far more evidence than the failure of climactic changes to explain population changes to exclude all other theses.  In fact, I'll propose another hypothesis, far older, but just as valid: what really caused the collapse of the Neolithic into the formation of Early Civilizations like Sumer and Egypt could just as well have been a change in human mentality. Are we simply to believe that these early humans had our same thought processes about disease, sanitation, and location, even though it's been less than two centuries since we truly pinned down the germ theory of disease?  Moreover, the correlation between the leveled society of the Neolithic vs. the totally new hierarchies of the first literate theocracies has to lead us to ask how vastly different the minds of these humans had to be! Consider all that had to be invented out of whole cloth, that a million years of humans living essentially as advanced, tool-using animals had not yet produced: ownership, first of women, then of offspring, and then of hereditary property; social class and the concept of dynasty, having evolved from the concept of ownership; time, in the form of past and future, recorded in the first preservation of ideas in a manipulable form; taxation and formal war, which are predicated both on ownership, literacy, and time... The list is gigantic. To use the modern parlance, it begs the question of whether these people had anything at all in common with their ancestors of just 1-2 millennia before them.  It was decidedly not farming that killed the Neolithic. There was a massive societal collapse; that much is clear. To claim causation without some massively convincing physical record, in the absence of any cultural recording due to prehistory, is simply misleading and false. But hey. It's clickbait."
AncientCivilizations,2n7sjx,PaterTemporalis,2,Mon Nov 24 10:27:32 2014 UTC,"I'm puzzled by this quote from the article: ""As people accumulated more food stores, women began giving birth to more children.""  Did nomads have sex less often than farmers? If not, why would women give birth to more children?

So, healthy, well-nourished women with optimistic futures  are likely to birth more children...Wherein nomadic cultures with no real agriculture, less physical health, and less of a nurturing environment for child - rearing are less likely to conceive, or permit a pregnancy."

AncientCivilizations,2n7sjx,cityterrace,-1,Mon Feb 16 13:49:01 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting. The fact that a ""flat"" society isn't viable beyond a certain size seems to be the reason why a true communist/socialist society has never worked well at the level of a country.   The kibbutzim in Israel are an example of a working flat society that's at the size where everyone knows everyone. When you get to a size of a thousand people or more the need for specialized classes arises and the whole social organization changes."

AncientCivilizations,2mdwv9,OmegaZero3,25,Sat Nov 15 16:00:44 2014 UTC,"Religion was a bit different back then. You didn't believe in only ""your"" gods, you worshipped the gods with the most influence on your life. Let's have a Roman-born legionary veteran who got a villa in a province in Greece for his time in the army.  That Roman man would be worshipping and sacrificing for his personal house god and most likely a few other Roman gods, like Mars (for keeping him alive in battle) and possibly the Emperor God (like the Lares Augusti) of the current emperor.  But he would also be sacrificing for a few Greek gods, if he needed their assistance, like a local fertility god/goddess.  You could also have a Greek-born man coming to Rome as a slave and later get his freedom and citizenship. He would possibly be still praying to some Greek gods, but he would also be sacrificing to Roman gods, as they would have the most influence over him, because he was currently in Rome.  The same can be said for Gallic or Egyptian people or Romans visiting those regions. In ancient times gods were not a thing of ""believe"" like today, they were part of the land and the people. If you were in Egypt, you better behave yourself so you don't make one of the mighty and (even in Roman times) ancient gods angry."
AncientCivilizations,2mdwv9,loofou,8,Sat Nov 15 17:41:19 2014 UTC,"What you have to remember about the ancient Greeks and Romans is that because they were polytheistic, they had no problem with the idea of different gods and religions coexisting. So, a Roman could believe in the Greek gods without worshipping them, and vice versa.   The Greek and Roman pantheons were very similar, partly because they share Indo-European ethnic roots, and partly because there was a lot of god-sharing going on in the ancient Mediterranean. Usually, people worshipped the gods of their homeland, but religious ideas were always spreading from place to place. For example, the Greek gods Apollo, Artemis, and Aphrodite were all originally from Asia Minor, and were later adopted by the Greeks. If you read the Iliad, these gods all side with the Trojans, because they were Trojan gods! And in Rome, there's even better documentation of the spread of cults: the Persian god Mithras became very popular among Roman soldiers in the 1st century CE, and the Phrygian cult of the Great Mother, Cybele, was brought to Rome during the Punic Wars, in the hope that she would ensure a Roman victory. So, generally speaking, people worshipped their own gods, but there was a lot of diffusion of religious ideas, and cults frequently circulated throughout the region."

AncientCivilizations,2ld7xh,StuartSmiles,7,Wed Nov 5 14:05:21 2014 UTC,"Just went to France over the summer and I'm a big history/archaeology nerd so I dragged my folks to a bunch of old locations that were pretty cool.  First, Niaux Cave (it's in south-western France, right by Spain and actually very close to the tiny country of Andorra) was incredible. It's a huge cave with Neolithic cave drawings in it, and it's the only one in France that still does tours inside. Not only were the cave paintings amazing, but the cave itself was huge and super cool, aaaaaand the Pyrenees mountains that you drive all through to see the cave were just breath-takingly beautiful. That was one of the highlights of my trip. If you only speak English try to book your tour ahead of time though, they only have the one English tour at noonish so it can sometimes fill up (they wont take more than like 20 people in at a time to help preserve the paintings).  The second one, is a decent sized city, and it's only about an hour-ish drive from the caves, so it's where we stayed when we went to see them. The city of Carcassonne is a big beautiful medieval city with a huge walled off fortress and a castle in the middle of it. You can climb the hill and go inside the walls of the medieval city, where they have a bunch of shops and restaurants (yeah, how many people can say they had dinner in a giant walled off fortress/castle), as well as tours of the actual castle and stuff. There are also these 3 castles on mountain-tops not too far from Carcassonne (maybe half an hour driving) and an archaeological dig next to them of an old medieval village, all of which you can go see and walk around in for a couple Euros. Those castles were beautiful, and if you do visit Carcassonne I definitely recommend checking them out as well. Also, kinda unrelated but there's this restaurant in the more modern section of Carcassonne called the Artichoke (in French, can't remember the word though) and it was probably some of the best food I ate on the whole trip........ I still have dreams about it some nights.  Anyway, the third place on my list is a little town called Annecy. This place is on the exact opposite side of France from the other two (very close to Switzerland), and it is right beside the beautiful Lake Annecy. As well as the Lake, it also has these really cool looking canals running through the old part of town, almost giving it a 'Venice' kinda feel.  Fourth, Bayeux is in Northwestern France, and is only about a twenty minute drive from the D-Day beaches. I would some of the beaches are better than others (they turned the Canadian one, Juno, into a windsurfing beach), but one of them has a nice museum as well as huge chunks of the portable harbor that they built after taking the beaches. If you're a big WWII history person then I would suggest seeing that. If you are more into ancient history like me, then Bayeux has a museum in it that contains the Bayeux tapestry. It's an old tapestry that depicts the entire story of William the Conqueror taking over England in 1066. The museum gives you a great audio tour with an interpretation of the tapestry, as well as tons of other artifacts from that time period.  Lastly, you're obviously gonna visit Paris and do tours and stuff, but something you might miss (and we kinda stumbled upon by accident), is the ancient Roman ruins under the city. The entrance to this little place is right in front of Notre-Dame (a staircase that leads down under the street). You can walk around these old Roman ruins and do an audio tour talking about the history of the city and what archaeologists know about the Roman time period.  Tl;Dr: Niaux Cave in Southwestern France has beautiful Neolithic artwork. Carcassonne has a huge medieval fortress and castles that you can not only see, but even eat, shop, and spend your day there. Annecy is a medieval city with canals that is very pretty and kinda like France's version of Venice. Bayeux is close to the D-Day beaches, and it also has a great museum about William the Conqueror. Check out the Roman ruins underneath the street in front of Notre-Dame in Paris."
