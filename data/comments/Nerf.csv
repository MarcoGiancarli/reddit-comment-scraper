Nerf,3e34nx,SearingPhoenix,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:08 2015 UTC,That's because of the alkaline batteries and the super cheap thin wire I am guessing is in there.

Nerf,3e34nx,SmoothOperator117,5,Tue Jul 21 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"That is a good question what it uses. /u/BlasterLabs, after testing, could you show us the guts if you feel like you know what you are doing opening a gun?  Different size motors will not be a problem. I can see FC280 or RC280 being used. Those have upgrade paths though not well explored at this point. They are also perfectly capable motors generally.  As to battery voltage, it really depends on how these motors are wound and whether the stock setup is critical or not. If it is, 2S would be the way to go. Otherwise I am expecting these to want 3S lipo or maybe 3S LiFePO4."

It's been our stance since day one. So opening them is of little use to us in a practical sense.  2) We don't have enough cash to simply go out and buy every new blaster that comes out, so if we open something up and can't get it back together (like we once did with a Revonix), then that particular blaster is no longer available as a reference for us to use in the future.

At BAFF (years ago) we had to draw a line somewhere, otherwise kids would just use BBs with a trace of foam glued on.  So we said one inch of foam, minimum.  Battlemax just barely passed.  Rival would not.  I don't think the Rival ""rounds"" are any heavier, either.  I only have one Battlemax ball here right now, but it's pretty clean and measures 2.24 grams.  I think it may have shrunk a bit with age, because I remember measuring >0.97, and today it's barely 0.94 inch.  Rounded to a tenth, it doesn't meet our old rules either."

If the ammo is as accurate as claimed to be, it should be relatively possible to do without taking forever."
Nerf,3e193k,Jangular,4,Tue Jul 21 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea. We might try something like that, especially if the rate of velocity drop-off is noticeable (kind of like Vortex, where they'd spend half their range basically just floating!)."
Nerf,3e193k,Jangular,3,Tue Jul 21 05:07:28 2015 UTC,"Please do as unless Target gets their shipment soon I won't be able to do it until the August release date, and it seems to be something that people have expressed as a concern. Would be important to do a comparison to the velocity drop off in darts as well so there is something to put it up against, which might be a bit more time consuming once you get out to 40-50 feet trying to get it in the right spot for the chrono, but would be worth the time investment I think."

Nerf,3e2lri,SocksofGranduer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"I like your puzzle based idea, too. Another good objective."
Nerf,3e2lri,code_echo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:32 2015 UTC,I never even considered something like this for nerf.  That would be brilliant.
Nerf,3e2lri,SocksofGranduer,3,Tue Jul 21 16:52:24 2015 UTC,Well I didn't think of it first either :)
Nerf,3e2lri,SocksofGranduer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I think it is important that games should have objectives (not just be elimination.) So, I agree defend the core or some variation could work. Perhaps setting up plastic eggs or balls atop traffic cones between the zones, and let the teams shoot them off, etc.  Regarding respawning, here is my plan: to respawn, you have to touch the back wall on your side of the gymnasium. The gym is large enough, that it would effectively take them out of play (range) for however long it takes them run back and forth. I would allow for unlimited respawning."
Nerf,3e2lri,DerpMods,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"You could even do empty pop cans with colored tape on them. For tagging and respawning, and easier way to do this might be freeze tag style. It would create a faster paced game, which the kids might appreciate."
Nerf,3e2lri,gubermench,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:34 2015 UTC,Your post is an example of value of this community. Good ideas!
Nerf,3e2lri,DerpMods,5,Tue Jul 21 18:04:00 2015 UTC,"I have a seething hatred for ""all ages"" games, not only because of the ""stranger danger"" stigma but also because of the reason you've addressed. Still, I think your take on how to handle it is a great idea. :-) If you can refine ammo collection/refill rules a bit, I'd say you've got a winner."
Nerf,3e2lri,gubermench,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. Regarding ammo, my plan was to provide the ammo myself (for safety and recovery reasons.) I'd divide the ammo evenly between teams, and of course they'll scavenge darts during the game. Do you see any problems with that?"
Nerf,3e2lri,torukmakto4,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"It would be really sweet if the zones were colored lights (eg. red vs blue) projected from the ceiling on a revolving rig so that the zones slowly moved around the arena. That way, the players have to clear new areas or be eliminated by leaving the zone. Sort of like the moving screen cave levels in super mario world. It could only be done indoors though unless you could get a really nice light rig."

Nerf,3e00iy,RS09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:07 2015 UTC,Indeed they are... this was a good product drop. We're looking forward to talking with them in-person about some of the designs here in a few weeks when they fly us up to R.I.  Should have some time to test things and ask questions by then!

Nerf,3e00iy,WalcomS7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:19 2015 UTC,"I just double checked just now, and Amazon has them available again, so I'm rolling the dice with that again. At the time they cancelled, they weren't taking more preorders, and Toys 'R Us had closed their preorders too.   Upside is now Amazon is listing the red Zeus for the proper price, so that's some money saved over the blue ones I had ordered initially."
Nerf,3e00iy,Donkie-Donk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:25:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I wanted a blue one but money is tight and that's a whole magazine just to have it another color.  Good luck. We all need your range tests out there.

Kewsh has a general love vibe with all the clip system blasters, but the XBZ needs FVJ honey.   Odd that he messed with the breach on this, the allure of using the 99¢ Raider is to simply utilize the already-in-place clip system with minimal work. Most people don't bother with Stefan Clips either.   Glad he did though, proper NiC shitcannons always need some love."

Nerf,3dyckc,SocksofGranduer,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:35 2015 UTC,Undecided. I have them sitting around I'm just not sure if I can use them on something. Originally that cut out in the shell was going to be for both a clip holder and dart holders on the outside. But the blaster is not wide enough to attach a clip holder and still be able to fit a clip in.
Nerf,3dyckc,Dysvalence,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"I want to try to convert them to belt clips.

Nerf,3dyckc,SearingPhoenix,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:50 2015 UTC,"No range mods for a couple reasons. First, the clips act as the barrel and won't let the darts have much space for velocity increases beyond a certain point. While I'm sure I would get some range benefit RoF would suffer as well as air capacity.  Second. The black box. That thing is intimidating looking and I have avoided messing with it as much as possible.  EDIT: I am also satisfied with the range the Rapid Madness gets. My most effective range is between 20ft and 30ft so I try not to fire at anything beyond 30ft. The Twisted Spinner gets better ranges so I will be using that for pot shots."

Nerf,3dzbd6,Rx30,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:26:01 2015 UTC,July 5. If you live on the east coast it usually takes ~2 weeks.
Nerf,3dzv1g,K2TheM,7,Mon Jul 20 21:40:02 2015 UTC,The added mass from the tape directly on the front of the tip is likely the cause of the stability and not the change to the holes.  The reason there are 2 holes is probably to make the drag symmetrical. Even if the drag was significant (it is proven not to be for the .50 cal tips but the mega may vary) the net torque applied to the dart about any perpendicular axis will be zero and thus the holes should not cause the dart to yaw.
Nerf,3dzv1g,torukmakto4,6,Mon Jul 20 22:02:34 2015 UTC,"Pardon my obsession, but I did some testing.  I did up several different styles of modifying the darts. I used simple sheer vinyl (the kind used for die cut decals).   STOCK DART: Really inconsistent flight path (IME). MINIMAL VINYL: I took a small strip and looped it over the top of the dart to cover both holes as a single piece. MINIMAL VINYL, HOLES EXPOSED: This was the same amount of vinyl as used in #2, but placed 90o so that the holes are exposed. FULL WRAP, HOLES EXPOSED: This was a large piece of vinyl that wrapped all the way around the tip, but then had pieces cut and relocated to expose the holes and maintain similar weight as the Full Wrap. FULL WRAP: Solid Wrap. Large piece of vinyl covering both holes.   Results:  In general the more vinyl applied the more accurate the dart became. I found that in low wind conditions there were minimal differences between the exposed hole and closed hole versions. However, when there was wind (particularly crosswind) the fully covered darts tended to perform the best.  Conclusion: Overall accuracy is largely influenced by how much front weight was added. In crosswind conditions the fully covered darts tracked best. It is however, much easier to just wrap a single piece of vinyl/tape around the tip without care for the holes.  In short:  You were correct that the better performance was in fact more due to the increased weight and less that the holes were covered."
Nerf,3dzv1g,torukmakto4,3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Excellent. I was about to do the same test with 33 tape, but my only 7 megas at the moment are all variously worn."

Nerf,3dzv1g,ThunderKrunk,0,Wed Jul 22 00:39:35 2015 UTC,"I will have to some more experimentation to see who is correct, as I didn't take it any farther than achieving my desired result (truer flying darts). It could be that the Mega Darts are ever so slightly neutrally balanced, but as I said to another commenter, I don't think it's a balance issue since the darts aren't tumbling through the air, they are veering off course (as if pulled in one direction).  Or, if this phenomenon is unique to me, I could just have a wonky batch of darts."
Nerf,3dzv1g,caffinated_logic,5,Mon Jul 20 23:14:21 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying is that adding a full gram of mass weight to the tip of a dart will make it more consistent.   Wow, who would have thought?"
Nerf,3dyrsr,oicu81shoe,4,Mon Jul 20 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"First the Hammershot. I was wondering if taking off the front orange thing would decrease performance. And if I do take it off are there any specific things I need to do?   People do that, but I am not convinced about reliability or accuracy.  Why not just cut some of the fat off that cylinder support? It doesn't have to be as tall under the frame nor stick out as far in front of the cylinder to accomplish its function.  You do not need to change the spring. A shim can get these up to 85-ish fps and at that point they are difficult to operate one handed and if you have smaller hands probably completely unworkable. Start with 3/8"" of 1/2"" CPVC and don't glue it to the spring guide until you have tested and adjusted the length to do what you want.  Also remove the AR, port the seal plate, and glue the seal plate on with Devcon, and remove the pegs from the cylinder.   Next the vulcan. I am going to be doing a battery mod on it using a 9.6V 2000mAh battery. Should I replace the motors or will the stock ones last? I'm planning on rewiring it so It wouldn't be too hard to do. Also is there a good method for extending the ammo belts? And is there a good way to store a larger belt while moving?   It's an AEG and there is only one motor. Said motor happens to be fine for upgrades.  Remove the AR (reliability) and consider locking the clutch solid if you will be careful with it. Also, watch out with spring upgrades, rod may break with no warning or apparent cause, other than stronger springs obviously increasing the chance of failure. Have spare parts on hand.  You might want a higher voltage battery. ROF will be low with 9.6V.  Ammo is best linked by removing the cover plate from one round and cutting the webbing of both belt segments to meet in the middle, then gluing everything with Devcon, maintaining belt pitch. Older ammo can be linked with a dummy round if you don't mind a ""click"" in the middle of your belt.   Next onto the Retaliator! I'm planning on replacing the spring, where would be a good place to buy one? I know that OMW sells them but I remember hearing it takes a long time for them to ship out. And is there any way to make a detachable pump grip for it so you could swap out the barrels?   OMW doesn't have a problem shipping springs. That is the one product safe to buy from OMW.  Not sure what you specifically mean by barrels (inner barrels? Nerf barrel extensions/whole forends?), or what you are considering detachable for the pump grip (all of them necessarily are but they may not be tool free or detach rapidly). Typically the pump grip uses some element of the forend/handguard assembly as a support rail."

Nerf,3dyrsr,DreadPirateRobertsIV,2,Mon Jul 20 17:49:13 2015 UTC,For the retaliator I've not heard of any swappable pump grips. The two barrels that have pump kits are the retaliator barrel and the longstrike barrel and they both have slightly different rail heights so different kits are needed.  That doesn't mean it is impossible. Why don't you try to. Grab some tools and try.

Nerf,3dyrsr,foam_data,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"I actually was thinking about this the other day while looking at my own Retaliator. I have both the V1 and V2 pump grips from f10555 on taobao. As far as I can tell with the V2, the only thing preventing the barrel from twisting is the piece being attached to the bottom rail. The barrel looks to have enough clearance to rotate enough to be removed. I was thinking that perhaps the V2 kit could be modified to not be attached to the rail on the barrel, and have the grip+frame rotate up and over the top after the barrel was removed and become usable as a top slide. The Retaliator itself would need some additions to stop the pump grip from just rotating freely, like L Brackets that the frame arms would sit on when rotated into either the pump and the top slide positions.  I did a quick concept in Photoshop so you can kind of see what I mean a bit clearer.  EDIT: I got the idea from a stock on an airsoft smg that does basically the same thing."

Nerf,3dyrsr,OracleofEpirus,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:34 2015 UTC,"Vulcan- the motor powers the gearbox which pulls the action back, it's spring powered, so you don't need to change the motor at all, just upgrade the wiring, battery and mainspring. The6kg Vulcan spring is available from Blastersmiths UK or BlasterTECH or possibly Dormlabs, OMW is out of stock. The same spring works in the Hammershot and OMW sell a Hammershot only one separately as well.   If you are making a bigger chain then the common mod is to put a big metal ammo can on the side. I like a centre mounted box. Google joining the chains together. Modifying the Vulcan is a waste of time IMO, it gets barely elite ranges and will be nowhere near as potent as a Rapidstrike or even a Stryfe.  Screw the overpriced kits from OMW for the Retaliator, the best combination is their 5kg spring, a new catch spring (hardware store is really cheap) and off you go. Springs are usually in stock and ship quickly, I have never had to wait more than a week for in stock items and I am in the UK.   The popular pump grips all have to stay on the barrel. You can't have a pump and swap barrels. If you want modularity buy a Stryfe or Modulus. The soon to be released BSUK pump grip kit will work with both Longstrike and Retal barrels."

Nerf,3dyoew,foam_data,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Send them back. They are not as good as stock motors on 3 IMR cells, even with a 1s Lipo. Don't waste time on them. If you haven't bought a battery yet and you really want to spend more money,  get a 2s pack and some 180's or a 3s pack and Falcons.  This is the 2s pack which fits without cutting. If you want meaningful 3s then look at Make Test Battle which has a list of parts as well as a good guide.  TBH your current set up is pretty good, if you rewire and get a new microswitch in there you are up the top end of performance. The difference in lag time is going to be pretty minimal, you will still shoot about 110fps average with what you have and none of the other solutions are going to top that. Tamiyas will be lucky to get 90fps and their torque is lower than most other common motors, so don't expect good snap response."

It can be a little difficult to reload or top effectively when you've got a LARP safe axe hanging from your wrist but I make it work. And yes, I leave it hanging there so if I get surprised during a reload, I can sink a hit (I think my character's on about 6 per location), snap my axe into my hand and cut them up before they become a problem. No more resorting to head butting people...  I'll get a video of my system done at some point. :)"

Nerf,3dxf06,Jangular,3,Mon Jul 20 20:09:29 2015 UTC,"Have you figured out what was causing the malfunctions? What darts are you using (FVJ?) and what barrel is in your barrel extension (is it a fluted recon barrel or a rifled retaliator one?)  An unreliable gun is a freakin' headache, and leads to a frustrating day :)"
Nerf,3dxf06,LimeyTactical,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:02 2015 UTC,The darts used are from a community dart pool that we pay 5$ to rent from for the day. Mostly streamline darts with some occasional koosh mixed in. I know the koosh darts perform terrible in my fly wheelers so I try to avoid those like the plague! The barrel is a retaliator barrel and doesn't seem to add to many issues to the jam factor. On the next battle I'll be using all of my own brand new FVJ'S in hopes that this will solve issues.
Nerf,3dxf06,torukmakto4,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"I know the koosh darts perform terrible in my fly wheelers so I try to avoid those like the plague!   They really shouldn't. Koosh is more or less THE flywheeler's dart. They are the definitive superstock dart in general.  UNLESS... you mix them with rifled barrels, that results in epic failure!"
Nerf,3dxf06,LimeyTactical,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"The rifled retaliator barrel is doing you no favors with regards to reliability, especially with koosh darts. Look for a thrift/yardsale recon extension or raider and swap the barrels."
Nerf,3dxf06,torukmakto4,3,Tue Jul 21 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"Good job on the footage. You have some of the coolest HUD graphics of any of the FPV nerfers out there.  Now as to the gameplay. I do not claim to be good, only someone who has been there and had Murphy strike and knows what it feels like. What I can give feedback on regarding how you played:   Reloading. You don't have to be super fast at drawing mags. I use tight fitting paintball pouches for mags. They are not easy to pull mags out of and I cannot do super 1337 oper8or mag changes from pouch to gun in a quarter second. You do not need to do that to play well. All you need to do is draw the mag before you NEED it. 6 or 10 rounds left during a fight, go for a fresh mag and have it in your support hand. You can then do a near seamless ""drop and move over"" reload and keep the pressure on. If the empty needs to go on the ground, it needs to go on the ground and it should go on the ground. Always keep the pressure on. Using corner as cover when possible. Take it wide in zombies, tight in PvP. Some of your deaths were from places you could have been shooting from behind cover and only added what should be an insignificant distance to your engagement range. ROF - If you are going to take potshots from the bleeding edge of effective range, you need not necessarily change the number of rounds you commit to that action, just fire them closer together in time. Spreading them out reduces or removes the cumulative anti-dodging effect of a burst fired at a decently high rate. From how you played semi, I think you should be a full auto player.   And finally, as uncool as it may be to say ""if you want to play better, you should tech your gun"" I think you need to take a careful look at equipment because some gut feeling with that build tells me you were having trouble directly because of it, perhaps more than is immediately apparent. If you are a long range player and like to stretch effective range and take potshots, you need to get any accuracy problem or missing fps accounted for and rectified or you are going to be at a disproportionate disadvantage. And it goes without saying that if you are having malfunctions, that needs to be addressed."

Nerf,3dwtou,ruthlessracer,7,Mon Jul 20 04:47:37 2015 UTC,"Try not to lose the shells. Here is were you get more if you do lose them. Don't leave a shell in the blaster, it will ruin the seal. Don't leave the darts in the shells, it will ruin the darts. Pros - Badass, badass, and badass.  Despite some shortcomings, it is a very fun blaster to use.  LaserGnomes make inserts that let it fire one dart with the same force that it uses to fire 3, as well as Megadarts. Cons - Not very practical.  Slow Rate of Fire, so intend to hit what you aim at, your shots are precious - you will also be vulnerable to attack until you've reloaded.  Dependent on shells, which can be lost.  On board storage for only 3 shells, but you can pick up some 3rd party 3D printed pieces for that. Or keep extras in your pocket.   It's one of my favorite blasters to goof around with, but I don't think I've used it in any type of game."
Nerf,3dwtou,Bert_The_Beard,5,Mon Jul 20 05:04:10 2015 UTC,"First, the blaster is basically a secondary. It's also amazing for close-quarters as it fires 3 darts at once is not only very hard to miss with, but it's very hard to evade. Take the stock out (two screws in the back), and either glue the shell holder to the side of it or make a new shell holder, and do a ductape/cardboard holster for it. It will not disappoint as a secondary.  You will also benefit from practicing reloading, especially while moving."
Nerf,3dwtou,WalcomS7,2,Mon Jul 20 05:51:53 2015 UTC,"Always hold a spare shell in your hand for quicker reloading. When you eject the previous shell, hold onto it until you're safe to drop it back in your stock or empty shell storage. And please, please, buy more shells. 3 is not nearly enough."

There is a 3D printed shell for the Sledgefire that can hold a Mega Dart (I believe you can achieve the same result by modifying the stock shells.) With some modifications to the blaster, you can make a Sledgefire that can fire both Streamlines and Mega Darts simply by grabbing the right shell.  I was planning to look into this mod myself if I can find this blaster on sale anywhere."

Nerf,3dv5kk,BigScaryBlackDude,2,Sun Jul 19 19:52:54 2015 UTC,Air shouldn't be getting back into the pump from the air tank so I can only guess that your leak is either in the check valve or somewhere else between the pump and the tank.  It's possible that you've got something stuck in the check valve that's preventing it from sealing. What did you use to deactivate the PRV?
Nerf,3dv5kk,-SSGT-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:58 2015 UTC,I used super glue to keep it shut. I waited quite awhile to make sure that the glue  was completely dry just to make sure that super glue wouldn't get into anything I don't want to.
Nerf,3dv5kk,-SSGT-,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"The pump cylinder isn't under pressure when you're not pumping so the only reason air would leak out of it is if air is first leaking into it from elsewhere.  It might not be the glue, small bits of debris could be trapped between the check valve seal and seat allowing air to pass back through it."
Nerf,3dv5kk,Supahvaporeon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:36:51 2015 UTC,"After firing it a a couple hundred times, I can confirm that it is probably debris getting caught in the check valve since the leakage is very little compared to before and sometimes barely noticeable now.

Nerf,3dv5kk,OVERL0AD,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:07 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's the plunger tube and not the valve in the front? If dust gets in the gap on the valve, it will discharge prematurely. Just pump and keep trying to discharge it."
Nerf,3dv5kk,OVERL0AD,2,Sun Jul 19 23:47:56 2015 UTC,It certain it's from the back since the sound changes when I cover the back portion.

Nerf,3drhy4,RANGER_RS,6,Sat Jul 18 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"Overall Thoughts:  --Switches: Janky as Hell. Probably Definitely going to replace these in my rewire.   --(In)Active Breaking: Also Janky as Hell, but I kind of like it. One less switch to deal with and works consistently.  --Flywheels: Actually not too worried about these. So long as they don't act like computer fans, everything should be fine.  Plans: Rewire and LiPo upgrade (2S). Let's see if we can't make a Working Man's SMG!  Sidenote: Not sure about others, but the one I have works WAY better with NERF mags than the Stock cheap 20-rounder.  EDIT: Formatting."
Nerf,3drhy4,foam_data,5,Sat Jul 18 19:32:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting. That is a horribly large pusher mechanism, it's like a steam engine! I would avoid coating the flywheels in anything, you will wreck their balance. Wiring loom looks nice and simple and all the weirdos who don't like rev triggers will like the single one on this.  Do you think it would be a viable war primary alternative to a cut down Rapidstrike?"
Nerf,3drhy4,foam_data,3,Sat Jul 18 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking to coat the flywheels in anything unless absolutely necessary. I know off-balance wheels can be problematic - they're the bane of my existence.  I think, in stock form, I would choose this over a RS for battle. The RS suffers from 2-3 times the rev up time, and while it has a longer battery life and a potentially faster fire rate (still not sure on this one, they're damn close on fresh batteries...), I'll take the price point and ultra-light weight (about half as much as a RS, both with batteries) any day.   For modded equipment, that is still yet to be determined. I'm thinking that the pusher motor on this may be potentially less powerful than an RS motor. That being said, if they perform roughly the same on a 2S LiPo, then absolutely I would use it as an alternative primary.   I've been looking for a ""Working Man's Assault Rifle"" to build for my HvZ squad for quite some time now, and if I can make this thing perform for cheap, then we have a winner.  EDIT: Nitpicky spelling."
Nerf,3drhy4,Lecic,3,Sat Jul 18 20:05:14 2015 UTC,"I have had 2 truly awful sets of RS flywheels across the bench this month. A cheaper, compact full auto is certainly tempting."

Nerf,3drhy4,torukmakto4,3,Sat Jul 18 20:28:54 2015 UTC,it's like a steam engine!   That brings me to an interesting question- has anyone ever attempted to make a steam powered nerf blaster?
Nerf,3drhy4,TopDart25,5,Sun Jul 19 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, those switches look very similar to a Nitefinder's light switch! Yeah, those should go.  I wonder if this revs up faster than a Rapidstrike simply because it lacks so many of the safeties present in the RS (which are a source of resistance); not to mention the Rapidstrike's diodes which drop voltage prior to firing."
Nerf,3drhy4,farmcoffee,3,Sat Jul 18 20:01:00 2015 UTC,"The clean current path, I think, is DEFINITELY a contributor. I don't recall any diodes in the stock wiring of a RS... though I could be wrong. Where in the blaster are you talking about?  They're spooky similar. And also I feel a major source of resistance. Those will be executed in place of something that can actually handle current. ;)"

Complete with the crank mechanism, trigger reset stuff, crazy clockwork linkage and little springs, and the tiny gears and fine pitch worm that always used to grind. Check the stock bushings to be sure they are not the wrong damn size as they were in the days of the T20A!  Pusher motor is a super long shaft. That's gonna be trouble, best solution may be to put carbons in the stock one.  The janky open air switches are carried over from the T20 IIRC.  Flywheels look OK. Larger diameter is good. If balanced they could be a possible upgrade for Nerf design cages although something looks funny with the hub area so perhaps not.  I find it funny that none of the usual Hasbro EMI related crap (motor inductors, motor caps, ferrites, etc.) is in here. I have always wondered what the deal is with that and I suspect Hasbro is just overzealous. Rarely do I see anything like what Hasbro does in other (non-electronic) electrical products."

Nerf,3dt9gm,fuckniggabitch,2,Sun Jul 19 06:07:33 2015 UTC,"There's a small 'slamfire mech' that will be right below your catch that will get dragged forward as the bolt comes forward.  If the trigger is pulled back as this comes forward, a sliding piece will be pushed up and disengage the catch.  It's pretty obvious here on the Raider (It's that bar above the trigger).  It's almost identical on the Rampage   That's not likely what's preventing you from pulling your bolt back whenever you want -- the part you likely want is your bolt lock. Coop's video shows how in pretty good detail"
Nerf,3dt9gm,SearingPhoenix,2,Sun Jul 19 12:47:34 2015 UTC,"To de-prime it you'll need to remove the bolt lock (to let you move the bolt back and open the breech) and hold the slam-fire bar forward (to allow the trigger to actuate the catch).  There is a better way of holding the slam-fire bar forward that allows you to de-prime but also allow you to keep the slam-fire feature if you still want it. All you need to do is hold the slam-fire bar forward which you can do by adding an external lever to make a ""de-priming catch"". This is how you do it with an EAT but it should be possible to do the same with a Raider or Rampage."

The foam compresses and the fit becomes too loose to hold the a/r spring down.  Firm darts never have that problem in any blaster."

A smart AR blaster will still function with ARs removed, but differently. All the barrels will fire at once.

Use 9/16"" for the end barrels and nest some 17/32"" to load the darts into. Seems like it'd be a cool way to operate the breech."

Nerf,3dqtnf,AuraCorp,6,Sat Jul 18 15:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that there is a best type of motor, but this video seems to cover which ones are mostly used my the Nerfing community and for what purpose they are used. I advise you watch it. I'd say the motors mentioned in the video cover the best of each category.   Perhaps the video can help you out.  My only suggestion: do not get RM2s. I've had a terrible experience with them. They're terrible 130 sized motors. Stock motors are better than those motors.  Since I don't want to list motor types, the video covers the best of each.  Again, you should probably watch it.   Edit: I'd also recommend checking out this video if you're considering a power source for an upgraded motor. Honestly, installing a motor is simple if it's a 130 size. It's basically a rewire then plug and play. This is coming from someone who really doesn't solder at all. If you need any help with that, you know who to ask (I've seen you here before, you know who the experts are). These guys have a good video which should help you with a motor upgrade, specifically if you choose Falcon motors, which I highly recommend.  Hope this helped. There isn't a best type of motor for each category, there are just ones that are better than others for specific types of upgrades if that makes sense. If you want to go all out Xtreme 180s would probably do more than enough for you."
Nerf,3dqtnf,ben827,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:59 2015 UTC,"Do not get RM2s. They're terrible 130 sized motors. Stock motors are better than those motors.   But not really?   What people don't seem to realize is that the RM2 hobby motor was designed for robotics and precision, they actually have a rated voltage of 1.5volts less than Hasbro motors.   Simply clean your circuit and continue to use AA cells. I'd recommend the 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, I'd bet the RM2's would outlive the 14500 cells."
Nerf,3dqtnf,Duke_Wintermaul,4,Sat Jul 18 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"Duke, I get they're good for certain circumstances, but after my bad experience with them and having to get someone (ask /u/foam_data, he had to deal with my ordeal, great guy for doing what he did) to make me a new circuit with new motors, I would never want someone to go through that. That's perfectly reasonable, isn't it? Now, I know RM2 motors are awesome for robotics and very light mods, but if you want the best, don't go for those.   So you're right, as a guy who was big on robotics, RM2s were the go-to, but for Nerf...stick with the stock motors. Believe me. As for the longevity claim, I honestly don't believe that at all, no offense. One died on me the minute I started using it. RM2s are best left for very light mods or simply left alone. And by light mods I mean don't use anything higher than 2 __fire cells and a dummy battery with them. Don't use IMRs or higher with them. Stick with basic Alkaline batteries if you go RM2 and don't upgrade your wires."

Nerf,3dqtnf,Duke_Wintermaul,2,Sat Jul 18 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"Simply clean your circuit and continue to use AA cells. I'd recommend the 1.2V NiMH rechargeable cells, I'd bet the RM2's would outlive the 14500 cells.   That will give stock response and stock ROF support, but 90fps. If thats what you want or think is good then go ahead. And I doubt that, people have burned them(stock brushes) even on 4 alkalines, the rated life of this motor is mere hours of idle speed.   But not really?   But yes really.  3S lipo, or even 3 IMR14500 cells in an AA tray (not optimal) and stock semi-auto motors will stomp on the RM2/4.8V setup by a large margin of torque, response and velocity.  You might be able to make RM2 deliver those things with a higher voltage, more current capable battery, but then the stock brushes will be instantly blasted. Swap those to carbons and they hold up, but the performance will be more ""rough sorta works"" than nicely tuned (excessive/loud speed and meh response).  In terms of AA/14500 setups, RM2 as a EDIT: HIGH kv (Geez that was dumb!) motor are current hungry, that is not what you want to make little cells and high resistance contacts work best. You want a low kv motor and the highest voltage battery possible. P=VI and V(drop)=IR, you can't reduce R without throwing away the AA tray and using a pack, but you can increase V and reduce I and thus cut your losses.  See, stock semi-auto motors and 3 (IMR) Li-ion cells. If there was a good motor wind out there that would be sweet spotted on 4S it would be even better."
Nerf,3dqtnf,torukmakto4,2,Sat Jul 18 20:11:32 2015 UTC,"Basically a longer version of what happened to me. Not to mention when you're trying to swap out an RM2, it comes apart. This happened to me when I tried switching them out. Thankfully I didn't need them after I swapped them out, but if I did I'd be pretty irritated that I'd have to be buying two more RM2s.   I actually have 4 spare RM2s if anyone wants them, so there's that. I might try them out if I'm doing a springer to flywheel mod sometime in the future."
Nerf,3dqtnf,ben827,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"The problem with the RM2 is the brushes fail. The nominal spec for them isn't bad. They are very like the Tamiya motors, they would probably like a 1s pack. People stopped using them because they broke all the time, far more so than with stock motors, coupled with the fact that AA cells couldn't keep up with the current demands. About all they are good for is office wars if you want something noisy."
Nerf,3dqtnf,foam_data,2,Sat Jul 18 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"They are kind of like a lower end Tamiya. I don't think they have the potential to do anything worthwhile. On 1S I don't think they would rev high enough or have enough stall torque to not be sluggish. On higher voltage (which I have seen) they are too fast and still have the typical low-turn motor ""laziness"" regardless of how much current they draw."
Nerf,3dqtnf,torukmakto4,2,Sat Jul 18 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"Carbon Brush them, and they're the best you can do on AAs.  That's about the best thing you can say about them.  It's not that RM2s are awful, it's the fact that a rewire and IMRs on stock motors is just as easy, and provide so much more performance."
Nerf,3dqtnf,SearingPhoenix,2,Sun Jul 19 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want it to go in, how you intend to use it, what battery you are planning on using and what game limits your preffered game has.

OMW 2.5 spring 390 motor, locked clutch, 18 cell SC nicad (yes you read that right and yep it's heavy!) About 10rps, velocity sucks but capacity rocks.  However I have seen a lot of piston rod failures right in front of the rack with decent springs on other guns than mine. That is my main concern, I have spares of everything else. Yes I could easily have enough spares if I thrifted some parts guns but to me a known risk of something breaking hard parts with any kind of regularity is really off putting."

Nerf,3doxsy,justusUMBC,2,Sat Jul 18 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"Could you describe the feed ramp mods?   That applies mostly to RS cages, and mostly the lower feed ramp, and involves grinding away part of it leaving more of the flywheel exposed and a shallower ramp angle. Stops shitty worn out darts from hitting the ramp and bending.   Why do you switch out the stock flywheels?   Mostly because a lot of RS flywheel sets are garbage, unbalanced, not even smooth on the surface, and I find they don't shoot that great.

Nerf,3doxsy,grimsaur,3,Sat Jul 18 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"Worker sells barrel stock. You can use any thin wall tubing with a smooth inside surface that will fit muzzle devices and flywheel cage snouts and isn't too much smaller than a stock inner barrel, but inner barrels usually have the fluting in them to reduce friction so YMMV. It hasn't been tested too well.  The LSFG, Raider, Alpha and Rayven (all color schemes) also came with long enough inner barrels to cut down. Have a Rayven one in that bullpup."

Nerf,3do6af,McRex007,2,Fri Jul 17 23:47:37 2015 UTC,Well I skimmed it :X Derp me.  I totally forgot PLA is picky about solvents. Supposedly Plastruct Plastic Weld works (according to 3dprinting boards anyway). Need to get some to try.
Nerf,3do6af,McRex007,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wasn't too worried about the PLA, though,since I knew it was going to get braced with the apoxie putty in addition.  They aren't going anywhere."
Nerf,3do6af,Blasterworks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:36:10 2015 UTC,I was thinking of just glueing two modulus stocks in line to make a nice solid stock capable of holding 2 magazines.  Now I have adjusted my ambitions accordingly and want to double the original idea up so that it holds 4 magazines in a 2x2 pattern.
Nerf,3do6af,WalcomS7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"2x2 would be tricky, I think.  It's going to start getting cramped, and the weight is going to be very significant."
Nerf,3do6af,WalcomS7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:19 2015 UTC,I'm more worried about getting 4 modulus stocks.
Nerf,3do6af,ben827,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:54:41 2015 UTC,It looks badass. But do you have plans to fill in that gap at the bottom to connect the bottom of the stick to the grip??
Nerf,3do6af,ben827,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"Nope, I like the openness of it.  I wanted to keep it open so that it can maintain universal functionality.  I can put that bad boy on any blaster that can take stocks and get the magazine storage.  Playing with people with severe velocity limits -- throw it on a stock motor Stryfe.  Want to run a springer?  No problem."
Nerf,3doix4,Duke_Wintermaul,8,Fri Jul 17 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"For those of you that don't know who 3DBBQ is, besides being mental and missing a huge portion of the hobby, he's a Taiwan Nerfer who for the past 5 years has been making progress on what he calls the JSPB homemade airblaster.   It looks like things have finally taken off for one of the famed founders of the R.S.C.B. system, they are now offering amazing 3D printed parts to build your own quality blaster.   For those wanting to replicate his design, yet unwilling to pay him any money, should take a gander at his 2010 Mad Ghost write-up. The Mad Ghost was one of the first designs he published, and can be made with hand tools and a trip to the hardware store."
Nerf,3doix4,ninny_muffins,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"ooh, thanks for the link to that write up, definitely going to try this myself!"
Nerf,3doix4,WalcomS7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:18:34 2015 UTC,"3DBBQ has a few iterations of the JSPB published, but the JSPBpro is the only available via his shop."
Nerf,3doix4,justusUMBC,4,Sat Jul 18 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"This is pretty interesting, but I'm not seeing any range claims or actual demonstrations of the finished kit in action.   The rifled darts is absolutely bonkers and the overall design is appealing."
Nerf,3doix4,ThunderKrunk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"Range is claimed at 75 feet flat on Nerfhaven. At that velocity, stefans should be pretty much spot on accurate."
Nerf,3doix4,justusUMBC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:27:53 2015 UTC,At what velocity?
Nerf,3doix4,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"The velocity necessary to shoot a slug type stefan 75 feet. So somewhere around 150 fps. As I understand it, the goal of the JSPB isn't to shoot really hard, it's to make a simple to build homemade air blaster that works well. 2 pumps is hardly any time spent compared to pumping most stock air blasters; not going to get insane performance, but will shoot quite well. I'm sure he includes an OPRV in these kits since they're made of PVC and it would be irresponsible to do otherwise, but it could obviously shoot further without it."

Nerf,3doix4,Aldegar1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:17:03 2015 UTC,Is it worth it to buy this kit?
Nerf,3dnc31,code_echo,6,Fri Jul 17 17:48:49 2015 UTC,As God intended.
Nerf,3dnc31,sarcasmcannon,5,Fri Jul 17 19:19:09 2015 UTC,The thing is absolutely massive with a stock attached.  Retaliator stock or a fully compressed Raider stock seem to be the best two options since the grip sits so much further forward from the rear compared to other blasters.
Nerf,3dnc31,SocksofGranduer,2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:20 2015 UTC,Second that.
Nerf,3dnc31,mazzDit,5,Fri Jul 17 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"Nice, there is now a use for the Retaliator stock!"
Nerf,3dnc31,Zombona,2,Fri Jul 17 22:14:54 2015 UTC,I bet a black worker stock would look pretty slick.
Nerf,3dnc31,PlanetElka,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"I bet you're right. I'd be a little worried about the size though -- seriously, it's huge. Shouldering it and reaching all the way forward to prime feels a bit awkward with anything bigger than the two stocks shown. The Spectre stock I tried was hilariously long."
Nerf,3dnc31,ironmagnus,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:11 2015 UTC,u/Bobololo thanks you.
Nerf,3dnc31,dvrocknroll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:56:50 2015 UTC,I guess Hasbro decided they'd rather hear people bitching that it didn't have a stock attachment point instead of bitching that they haven't made any mega themed stocks.
Nerf,3dmoz7,Pie_Gun,9,Fri Jul 17 14:53:45 2015 UTC,For the lazy.  Actual demonstration at 8:15.
Nerf,3dmoz7,noonespecific,4,Fri Jul 17 16:34:39 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Nerf,3dmoz7,Helicuor,9,Fri Jul 17 16:46:50 2015 UTC,Are you saying the Corps Scatterblast isn't good?
Nerf,3dmoz7,Duke_Wintermaul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:19:52 2015 UTC,It's pretty rare...
Nerf,3dmoz7,Elusive2000,5,Fri Jul 17 23:47:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, this is more useful as a mine hooked up to a tripwire."
Nerf,3dmoz7,Lecic,2,Fri Jul 17 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"This is really cool! I would like to make my own. However, it does not seem very practical."
Nerf,3dmoz7,crocs54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"no, but if you could make it fire in more directions it would be"
Nerf,3dmoz7,LandgraveCustoms,6,Fri Jul 17 15:38:57 2015 UTC,I think the trick is the mount this into a sphere with a weighted bottom. That way it would tip upward and get more spread without that much more tech. The drawback would be the size; it's already just at the limit of acceptable carry size and I don't think a huge ball would help that.
Nerf,3dmoz7,JugglerCameron,5,Fri Jul 17 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"Not a horrible idea the other option is to make it more complicated and add an air bladder that is round and weight it so when you pull the pill it inflates and becomes round with the weight on the inside of the sphere so the explodey bits are up,  then it explodes."
Nerf,3dmoz7,LandgraveCustoms,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:00:22 2015 UTC,That sounds like the most efficient yet complicated way to do this.
Nerf,3dmoz7,Captain_English,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:41:42 2015 UTC,Hmmm. A small but heavy hemisphere on the pin end would work and shouldn't take up too much space.
Nerf,3dmoz7,troyareyes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:14:49 2015 UTC,I suppose you could cut the darts down by 3/4s?
Nerf,3dmoz7,FC-TWEAK,2,Fri Jul 17 21:12:14 2015 UTC,You could take two and tie/glue them together at the middle with one facing one way and the other facing the opposite way
Nerf,3dmoz7,Kaiju_Blue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:23:53 2015 UTC,Airsoft grenades are really expensive...
Nerf,3dmoz7,Big_Poppa_Nerf,2,Fri Jul 17 21:45:00 2015 UTC,Now I want to see a Radio controlled detonator version. Or some kind of mine/trip wire version would be pretty cool.
Nerf,3doct5,RANGER_RS,2,Fri Jul 17 22:30:23 2015 UTC,Have not yet disassembled. Planning to take internal pics either tonight or tomorrrow.
Nerf,3doct5,farmcoffee,2,Sat Jul 18 00:01:14 2015 UTC,Great! Thank you!
Nerf,3doct5,Lecic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:17:09 2015 UTC,No problem!
Nerf,3doct5,foam_data,2,Sat Jul 18 06:54:22 2015 UTC,"Only 7 mags before batteries start draining? That's... a bit annoying. Carry spare AAs with you if you're using this, I guess."
Nerf,3doct5,foam_data,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:19:26 2015 UTC,"Like I said, that's a guess. I'm pretty nit picky about my power output. Plus I'm gonna be opening this up and giving it a LiPo overhaul."
Nerf,3doct5,torukmakto4,2,Sat Jul 18 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"The battery drain is no surprise at all. AA's are tiny for this job, that's why Hasbro use C batteries.   Those numbers compare pretty well with a stock RS."
Nerf,3doct5,torukmakto4,2,Sat Jul 18 07:15:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. What excites me about all of this is the flywheel motors - in stock form, they're fully revved in about half a second, roughly half to a third the time of a stock RS. This leads me to believe that either A) Auto Tek motors are designed to rev quickly and accept high current, which will make them perfect for a LiPo overhaul, or B) BuzzBee is using decent stock wire and/or low-resistance components. Both prospects excite me.  EDIT: Spelling."
Nerf,3doct5,foam_data,2,Sat Jul 18 07:22:38 2015 UTC,"I suspect that they are tuned for the lower power output of AA batteries, which means they might perform like some of the other aftermarket 130's when hooked up to Lipo.  The problem in the Nerf system is purely the lack of current to the motors. Internal resistance of wire and components are pretty munch the same across all the blasters, I can't see buzzbee doing anything high performance, not at that price point."
Nerf,3doct5,foam_data,2,Sat Jul 18 08:04:57 2015 UTC,"Well, only time and lots of modding will tell if these motors are worthwhile. If they are, I've got some carbon brushes ready for them. If not, I've got some banshees waiting for them.   I'll open it up today and we can find out for ourselves. I'm really curious to see what kind if switches they used. There also seem to be no electronic or mechanical locks in this blaster."
Nerf,3doct5,EldVrangr,3,Sat Jul 18 15:16:41 2015 UTC,Be careful of motor temps with the serrated flywheels.  What I really want to know is how the pusher works and if it is a T20 type gearbox.
Nerf,3dnphq,nerfmaster8,7,Fri Jul 17 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"Might have to repost some of these on our site... a lot more useful than those janky ""behind-the-scenes"" videos they've been sending us."

Nerf,3dnphq,KyranTheWalker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:21:47 2015 UTC,that intro's been in these demos since the release of N-Strike though not every blaster back then got a demo video. still good to see what little extra details can be gotten despite knowing most from the Toy Fairs.
Nerf,3dnphq,traingeek2000,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"Already I don't like the Zeus, as it cannot accept larger magazines."
Nerf,3dnphq,SearingPhoenix,2,Fri Jul 17 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"The main consideration will be whether or not 12 foam golf balls is roughly equivalent to 18 standard darts.  If they're significantly more accurate, it might be even enough to be reasonable."
Nerf,3dnphq,foam_data,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"I still feel like however accurate they are, you will still be able to dodge them. You might get the hit ratio down to 2:1 which means the same number of tags as a decent modded Stryfe on an 18 which is around 3:1.   Overall the lack of a protruding magazine may have benefits for things like shooting prone."
Nerf,3dnphq,Lecic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"I have an idea for a larger Zeus mag, actually. I think I'll draw it up and post it on the subreddit in a little bit."

Nerf,3dmmxq,Zombona,2,Fri Jul 17 14:36:42 2015 UTC,That is a very focused arsenal. I still love what you did with the crossbow/rs integration.
Nerf,3dmmxq,SocksofGranduer,2,Fri Jul 17 14:41:34 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by focused? I have springers and flywheels.  I call that integration the Falcon. It is incredibly fun and very comfy. It is however heavy and off balance. I made it to be used at an HVZ game (Clips, rapid fire and reliability, back up shot) but I am not considering using it again."
Nerf,3dmmxq,SocksofGranduer,4,Fri Jul 17 14:50:57 2015 UTC,It's a small collection of blasters that all point to one specific way of enjoying Nerf Games. You know what you like and you stick to it. Focused :)
