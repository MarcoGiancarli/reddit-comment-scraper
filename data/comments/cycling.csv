If you've got mates riding, or you want to gauge yourself against other riders in your area, you might want to register with Strava; MovesCount will automatically push to Strava on each upload once you configure it. Premium membership has a nice feature that gives you a 'heatmap' of everywhere you've ridden.  I've just clocked up 2,800km (~1,740mi) since July '14 (although I didn't have my Ambit2 for the first few months). My average ride is around 35km (21mi) which I can do very comfortably and 50km (31mi) is around the time I'm looking to get off the bike. My longest ride thus far is 82km (50mi) which left me drained but it was an impromptu effort and I was admittedly under-prepared on the day. FTR I ride a 29er MTB with off-road tyres mostly on the road. I've just ordered some road tyres and am awaiting delivery.  It's a great way to keep active and I've already hooked one mate and he, in turn, has dragged another rider along semi-regularly. Still working on the wife but with a baby at home it'll be 6 months or so before she can get out and about with me. Like you, I'm hooked, and look for every opportunity to get on my bike. I've even just started riding to work when weather permits."

cycling,3e2un6,Nightshade400,5,Tue Jul 21 17:44:51 2015 UTC,"""Technology"" is very vague.  As examples: A lot of pros nowadays are using electronic groupsets now.  Those haven't trickled down below that price point on a bike yet, and those came out in 2012 or 2013 I think?  On the other hand 11 speed is now a standard across most bikes on the upper side of that range.  Carbon fiber is barely obtainable around $2000, but you're not usually going to get much aerodynamic consideration at that price point.  Functionality tends to ""trickle down"" pretty well, it seems, but at any point in time the fancy stuff is going to have other ""bonus features"" that don't make their way down so quickly."
cycling,3e2un6,illustribox,7,Tue Jul 21 16:50:21 2015 UTC,There are lots of CF offerings in the 1-2k range.
cycling,3e2un6,megagreg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"barely obtainable   That does not preclude your statement, and the spirit of its statement was to say that carbon fiber is indeed now obtainable at lower levels of the price spectrum.  It's doable, but it's mostly on the very high end of that range, and also in that spirit it is worth noting that a similarly specced aluminum bike costs $600-1000 less."
cycling,3e2un6,illustribox,3,Wed Jul 22 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"other ""bonus features"" that don't make their way down so quickly   Power meters are a good example of this. Strain gauges are expensive, and will continue to be expensive until new discoveries lead to cheaper manufacturing."
cycling,3e2un6,DonOblivious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"Strain gauges aren't actually that expensive, the expense of power meters has more to do with the niche market (low quantity) and the consequential problems with obtaining sufficient accuracy under temperature changes, distribution, minimal competition, etc...  The lack of distribution structure alone, for example, helps knock down Power2Max to $600 for a crank spider meter."
cycling,3e2un6,megagreg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:33:36 2015 UTC,"niche market (low quantity)   It doesn't help that the manufacturers are intentionally shooting themselves in the foot by refusing to reuse tooling.  I don't recall the brand but they were bragging in an interview about how they designed a new battery cover to save weight.  All I could think was ""sure, just throw away that $20,000 you spent designing and building a mold just to save a few milligrams, fucking retards.""  Increasing the amount of p/n's used to build your products is the exact opposite of what you want, especially when it comes to something as expensive as an injection mold!"

cycling,3e2un6,TotesMessenger,4,Tue Jul 21 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"As you say, unfortunately for this comparison we can't really do it directly.  Across eras, you'll have bikes that are better at some things and worse at others (e.g. some older bikes are lighter but without aerodynamic focus, there are a lot of things like fit differences that compound performance differences, trying to compare actual performance differences across minor changes like 10-11 speed or different shifting mechanisms is really hard, etc...)  I can tell you I rode an entry level carbon bike from 2007 recently (Felt with 105) and it was about comparable to my 2013 good aluminum.  So I'd assume a top of the line bike from the beginning of the big carbon era would still be significantly nicer than anything in this price range."

Don't put money into a bike you're just going to sell ... you won't recoup your money unless you get your hands on used parts cheaply.  Let the buyer know the history, and price it appropriately.  Someone will be happy to get a bargain on a bike they can build up their own way, and you get to make some money back on a bike you had written off."
cycling,3e3vzs,Gnascher,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:57 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I've posted it now. I just haven't had much success with it. I was just wondering about a straight answer on the minimum I'd have to do, if I decided to go down the route of fixing it for sale.  I know it's counter-intuitive, (the potential buyer might not want those particular wheels, etc), but some of the prices I've been getting have been a bit ridiculous - I keep getting lowballed for about $100, and this bike was $560 when new only a couple years ago."
cycling,3e3vzs,w1n5t0nM1k3y,3,Tue Jul 21 20:39:14 2015 UTC,"Sell them separately. Sell the bike without wheels, and the rim brake wheels by themselves."
cycling,3e3vzs,Gnascher,3,Tue Jul 21 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"Bike's have rather large ""off the lot"" depreciation.  So, $100 might be a little low, but probably not too far off the mark for ""damaged merchandise"".  A couple thoughts:   If the frame has mounts for traditional rim brakes, you could add a set of those... but I don't see any bosses for cantilever or v-brakes, so you're looking at some kind of caliper brake.  Not correct for that kind of bike, so  I don't think it'll help the value out much. Try and find a set of used rims with appropriately sized disk brakes ... but I don't think you'll make your money back here unless you get real lucky and find a steal. Strip the bike down.  Sell it as a bare frame/fork set, and sell the components separately.  You said it's a $560 bike new, so I'm guessing pretty low-end components, but used components don't depreciate as bad as the whole bike does if they're in good shape.  This is probably the best way to maximize your money. Easiest (if you just want to walk away) is to take the best offer you get from Craigslist after a little time running the ad."
cycling,3e3vzs,i_speak_the_truf,2,Tue Jul 21 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure they're low balling you. If you paid $560 several years ago it's probably worth like $300 in good condition. Considering the cost of new wheels and rotors I'm not sure id pay more than $150 for that bike. If you fix it yourself you may get $350 or so off cl but you'll spend $150+ replacing the missing parts unless you can source used parts. Maybe ask your local shops, I know one near me has used rotors."
cycling,3e3vzs,Infinity6,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but what do you think this bike is worth?  It was $560 new a couple years ago, so if it was in perfect condition it would be worth what, like $280-$300 tops?  But this bike needs a new set of wheels and some work put into it.  Equivalent quality new wheels and discs will probably cost you $150+.  I would try and sell the frame and wheels separately."
cycling,3e3vzs,CreatineBros,0,Tue Jul 21 22:16:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't think that markdown would be 50% at best - that is ridiculous. I'm not asking for 90% of the ticket price, but I thought that it was worth more than just a hundred bucks."
cycling,3e3vzs,Nomnom_downvotes,3,Tue Jul 21 22:41:07 2015 UTC,"Well, you've got lower-grade wheels, and need discs / rotors. That's a lot.  Plus, it's coming with ""it got stolen"" on it, so you knock something off as there was at least one owner who really didn't care and people will get scared away.  Lastly, the new owner has to feel confident doing that work on the bike, so that reduces the pool.  To be honest, $100 seems a touch low, but not a lot.  Sorry for your situation.  That sucks."
cycling,3e3vzs,Gnascher,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:16:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately bikes don't really hold value. A $650 bike a few years ago is probably only worth a couple of hundred now. It would probably be better to strip it and sell it as parts.   Good luck with it though, fuck thieves. >:("

It does have its perks one being that it stops me from drinking as much as I would do.   Vaping is a good shout. Or even cooking my own space cakes again - They are way more efficient then smoking imo but the high lasts so damn long!

It's hard because I have people offering me blunts and bowls literally everyday at my house due to roommates and roommates friends. But so far so good three weeks in. Vapes don't make it that much better for me unfortunately. But again I have pretty sissy lungs that don't want anything non-air related in them.

While any amount of cigarette smoking is bound to be bad from you in some way, quitting didn't really show any positive impacts in my ability to cycle (either from basic respiratory ability or my energy levels) or the way food tasted or positive mental state or any of that other stuff people drone on about why life is so much more rosy when you quit smoking. My guess is that stuff happens for people who are pack a day smokers.  What it did successfully accomplish is not making me smell like an ashtray all the time."
cycling,3e3m9o,v12wannabe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:01 2015 UTC,Yeah that doesn't seem like enough smoking to be completely detrimental to your health especially not for a short period of time. How long had you been smoking before quitting? Also I am training quite a lot more then 90 miles a week so I'm hoping the tiny effects will have a significant impact on my performance (although I'm also kinda hoping that I don't get a performance boost to show I haven't done too much damage).  I am going to be touring around Europe in August for 11 days doing about 100 miles a day so I want to be in peak condition for that!  It sounds like you really had your smoking habit under control. But for me there are days when I feel I really am doing damage by the amount I will smoke.  And the smell of smoke is disgusting - I agree with you there!

I never felt like smoking hurt my riding ability.   Smoking after a ride was awesome! I had my habit under control. I was able to stop for a week if I was traveling and didn't want to deal with it.   I decided to stop September of 2014 and haven't had one since and haven't wanted one.   When I first started riding this season I felt no different. It wasn't until April that I was going up a large hill 3 gears harder than usual and I was barely breathing. It hit me! This was the result I was hoping for.   The whole reason I didn't quit sooner was because I didn't think there would be much benefit, but I finally have my reason. Before September I was looking online for solid proof of how much speed I will gain or how my performance will get better without smoking. That info isn't there because it's different for everyone and only you can convince yourself that you will benefit in someway.   I don't taste food any differently but I think people who smoke smell awful now. I was convinced I didn't smell, but now I know!  I think if you stop now you might never notice anything, or you might get similar results as I did. The only guarantee is that the longer you smoke the harder it will be to quit and harder biking will become. You will notice a drop in performance at some point.   I don't care if you quit or keep smoking, that is your choice. I just hope the information I have helps you make a decision. Feel free to message me or ask anything else. I will be glad to help."

I do know that the BB area is a place companies put extra material to reinforce the frame, but I tend to go to the side of caution.

However I'd recommend either buying from someone you know or just finding a reputable bike shop with used bikes.   I bought a new 2015 specialized allez comp after trying to find a used bike, which I'm much happier with than had I bought a used bike. The particular bike shop I got it from gave me a TON of perks (2 free tune ups, 15% discount, etc.)and really made spending a few hundred dollars extra worth it.

cycling,3e4i8z,gaugeinvariance,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:13:38 2015 UTC,You can try to run wider tires which may help if you keep the pressures the same or go for tubeless tyres for puncture resistance
cycling,3e4i8z,sonorous7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:06 2015 UTC,"are new tires likely to help the problem?   Maybe, maybe not. Puncture proof resistant tyres are good against objects intruding upon them, but not so great against pinch flats caused by low PSI and ramming into obstacles.   Make sure your tyres are near their max PSI. Are you using a pump with a gauge, or are you going ""by feel""? If you don't have a gauge, you're probably running on flat tyres.  Avoid hitting potholes if possible - you don't have to ride straight over them. If they're unavoidable, slow down and take your weight off the wheels as they hit it."
cycling,3e4i8z,Gnascher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"There are two types of flat, puncture and pinch. Puncture flats occur when the tube gets penetrated by something, like a nail. Pinch flats occur when you hit a deep pothole and the rim itself cuts the tube. You can tell which of the two you are getting by examining one of the used tubes. If you are getting pinch flats you have to pump your tyres more, and probably more regularly. If you are getting puncture flats, you need better tyres, not better tubes. Get some tough, puncture-resistant tyres. Also, when changing tubes, make sure there's nothing left in the tyre that can damage the new tube.  At any rate, the best thing you can do to avoid flats is to keep your tyres properly inflated."

cycling,3e2q3d,Gnascher,6,Tue Jul 21 14:35:49 2015 UTC,Have you had your sit bones measured? You may have a saddle that is too narrow.  I did when I got my Giant TCR it came with a fizik Arrionne a very good saddle so I figured I would get use to it and I endured.  Anyway had the same pain you are talking about.  I then watched a youtube video on sitbones and I measured myself and what do you know I needed a saddle that was 25mm wider.  I bought myself a Fizik antares and now I am very happy. The reason it matters is that if your sit bones are not taking the weight your soft bits sure are!
cycling,3e2q3d,Cranky24-7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:30 2015 UTC,Seems like a nice easy method for getting sit bone width.  I'll give that a try.
cycling,3e2q3d,Nerdlinger,4,Tue Jul 21 15:10:15 2015 UTC,"For these things I always recommend Rido saddles more or less, these saddles are built so that the area where you sit is higher than the nose of the saddle so your perineum has breathing room while you ride.  They're incredibly comfortable, and I've logged a number of centuries and a couple of 500+ mile tours on mine without once noticing the saddle beneath me (and really, that's about the highest compliment you can pay a saddle)."
cycling,3e2q3d,dingusbattus,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:10 2015 UTC,I put a Serano RL saddle in replace of my stock saddle and it helped lots.  It's not a super cheap saddle and it looks like it wouldn't help but it did nonetheless.
cycling,3e2q3d,PandaWatch_,2,Wed Jul 22 01:17:53 2015 UTC,"Seems like everyone here has noted the most likely suspect: sit bones and getting a matching saddle.  However, it is probably best getting a full fit if you can as there might be other factors at play: - having your saddle too high will mean you 'rock your hips' as you pedal and therefore make more friction downstairs. - having too long a stem may mean your overreaching and putting more pressure on the fore of your undercarriage - having the right width handlebars will also impact your reach  Finally, I'd recommend getting the best bibshorts (for the chamois pad) and gel pads under bar tape or overtaping the handlebars to help with road buzz and your wrists.  Good luck in sorting it out!"
cycling,3e2q3d,PandaWatch_,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"Bar width and stem length are worth checking for tweaks I suppose.  I do like an aggressive position though, and I'm not having any discomfort in my neck.   While I do find them generally comfortable, I've never had them checked by someone knowledgable.   I ride with lightly padded gloves and nice cork bar tape ... in general my hands feel fine ... it's just additional stress on the arms when I have to keep pushing myself back in the saddle when I have a tip the nose down.  I do have cycling shorts with a good chamois ... they do help a bit and I don't really have any chafing issues.  I'm pretty confident in my seat height ... if anything it was a smidge low, but I recently raised it 1/4"" and feel an improvement in my stroke."

cycling,3e21sy,xXxHealz,7,Tue Jul 21 10:25:48 2015 UTC,Puking after exercise doesn't sound ideal and certainly shouldn't be considered 'normal'. The swerving and discomfort may both be caused by inappropriate bike set up. Check out a YouTube vid on how to set up your bike.
cycling,3e21sy,stevenumb,2,Tue Jul 21 13:12:23 2015 UTC,"Is it normal for the anterior aspect of the thighs to be the prime muscles utilized on a ride?   Yes, these are the muscles that extend the knee downwards, which is the primary source of power when pedalling a bike.   How long did it take you guys to stop swerving around as if being attacked by bees?   Road bikes feel a bit odd if you're not used to them. Unlike a mountain bike or something, a road bike's minimal weight and very thin tires make it a bit less stable and more sensitive. With practice, you'll get used to the finesse necessary to keep it moving in a straight line.   Are the bike seats supposed to deter you from sitting by being as uncomfortable as possible?   Again, this might simply be a matter of getting used to things, as road bike seats aren't typically ""comfortable"" by conventional standards. That said, it shouldn't be so uncomfortable that it hurts or that you don't want to sit. If this persists for a while, consider going to a bike shop and trying out a saddle that better suits you."

I might go see a doctor if you haven't seen one before starting to exercise. It doesn't seem like that should be normal for anyone.  E: Congratulations on getting out on your first ride! Keep at it and all of your issues listed here should disappear fairly quickly.  I'm not sure what your route looked like, but bikes tend to be much more stable at about 6-10mph I've found and getting a bit more forward momentum will help your swerving significantly."
cycling,3e21sy,mnews7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:08 2015 UTC,"I've gotta ask, how often do you throw up? Is it related to exercise? Yes your thighs have the big power. Also your butt muscles. Next time when your thighs are tired, try pedaling by using your ass muscles as well. Kind of like a squat feel. Swerving will stop as you grow more confident. Look further ahead and hold steady! HOOOOOOLLLLD!  Depending on your weight, you might consider replacing the stock bike seat with something else. Cushy, springs, a big wide ass perhaps? Depends on your body type."

cycling,3e21sy,MTFUandPedal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"Yes those are the prime muscles used in cycling. It hurts initially but they get strong rather quickly with repeated use, so don't give up.  Look further out in front of you, relax your grip on the bars and try going just a bit faster. Speed helps balance and a deathgrip on the bars will cause unsteadiness, it seems counterintuitive but it is truth.  You just started so your body has to get used to it and your butt will be sore. Just like with the leg muscles it takes a little bit of time.  Puking afterwards should never be considered normal. If you don't have a known health issue you may want to get checked out concerning this."

The Gatorskins are very non-pliable, which gives them that ""dead"" ride feel without much damping and usually increases the rolling resistance.  In the affordable but pretty good all around category, one of my favorites is the Continental Grand Prix.  Other options include the Specialized Roubaix Pros and the Vittoria Rubino Pro III."
cycling,3dyvs5,illustribox,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"Yep lots of experience.  Don't touch them. They are fucking horrible.  The wet grip borders on the lethal. It was likely a contributing factor in at least one accident I believe I'd have avoided on the 4 seasons I prefer to run as winter tyres.  They are also heavy, roll poorly (so they are slow).  They are however cheap.  There's a fantastic solution for not having to walk your bike home. Take spare tubes with you and learn to change one!"
cycling,3dyvs5,MTFUandPedal,2,Mon Jul 20 20:16:38 2015 UTC,"Same experience, in the dry they're alright, in the wet, don't expect to stop without putting a foot down otherwise you'll meet the pavement (especially if they're fully inflated)"
cycling,3dyvs5,tyrrtll,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:32 2015 UTC,I had an accident in rain thanks to them as well. Now I refuse to use them.
cycling,3dyvs5,blopp,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:58 2015 UTC,I went from multiple flats in a single ride to 3 in the last 7 months switching to Gators. We have goathead thorns in abundance around here so everyone armors up or suffers the cost.
cycling,3dyvs5,Nightshade400,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:01 2015 UTC,Used Gatorskins for years riding round London. Rarely got a puncture. Try and get a wider width to offset the harsher ride though.
cycling,3dyvs5,speed_sloth,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"I've ridden the same pair of gators on my commuter bike for 3 years and have never had a single puncture flat. Worth every dime, huge recommend."

I've popped a bunch, but…  A lot of people here say they're horrible. I mainly ride in decent weather, and haven't noticed anything problematic with them.  You can also check out ThickSlicks since they're supposed to be really puncture resistant too. I've never used them."
cycling,3dyvs5,rjksn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:52 2015 UTC,They're good tires. But the Performance brand Strada K (as in Kevlar) did as well for me at a much lower cost.  YMMV
cycling,3dyvs5,StrawHousePig,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"I ride Conti Gatorskins regularly here in the San Francisco Bay Area with only 1 flat in ~6,000 miles. I am aggressive about swapping them out for new ones every couple of thousand miles, however. If you follow the advice others have given here about keeping tires inflated to the right pressure, pinch flats shouldn't be a problem either.  I'm a serious recreational rider (don't race any longer) so the heavier weight isn't a big deal for me. I ride 700x23 tires, for reference."
cycling,3dyvs5,coda7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:40 2015 UTC,"I have 300 miles on gatorskins as a commuter. Previously I had Vittoria rubino pro slicks and loved them. I got about 2000 miles before the back tire squared off and the front ran over a massive piece of glass (but didn't pop! It got me home but I don't trust it so took it off). If the gatorskins get me 3k before they square off, I will keep getting them for commuting."
cycling,3dyvs5,Pulptastic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:34 2015 UTC,I am approaching 3k right now and the rear is showing signs of squaring off. I am hoping it is just paranoia but I aint mad either.

cycling,3dyvs5,Mirageswirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:45 2015 UTC,I commute 12 miles a day in Chicago and haven't had a flat in 15 months.  I highly recommend them.
cycling,3dyvs5,soapinthepeehole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:24 2015 UTC,"Funny to see this thread, because I just had to replace my back Gatorskin after 1200km. I only got one or two punctures in that time, but what got me was a ~ 1cm cut across the sidewall that was large enough for the tube to poke through like a tumour. My last two rear tyres were worn to the bead after ~2000km, but never had a cut open up like this. So I wonder if the Gators are more susceptible to being cut open?"
cycling,3dyvs5,monsieur_le_mayor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:48:30 2015 UTC,"Roadbike, 2 years with gatorskins.   I've hit huge rocks, had to vault up curbs at high speeds, towpaths, etc. No flats from any of that.   Love my Gatorskins. 100% worth it. My old tires didn't feel so stable.   They're not super performance, or very light, but they are durable for someone who just want something that won't pop on his commute."
cycling,3dyvs5,crawsome,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"Use them on my bike for commutes.  Decent price, not terrible to put them on. I use stop flat liners too, I know it's an overkill but I want to avoid flats as much as possible.  Im tired of replacing tires mid-ride, especially when I'm going to work.  They are great for commuting.  I don't exactly ride a million miles an hour in traffics or take super tight fast turns."

cycling,3dyvs5,luckylee423,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:04 2015 UTC,"So much hate on Gatorskins in this thread. I went at least 2000 miles before getting my first flat on my 25c gatorskins. As for traction in the wet, just drop your pressure by 10-15 psi."
cycling,3dyvs5,cat-the-great,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"I am still new to cycling, but 1,000 miles so far and no flats on my first set of Gatorskins. I am 240 lbs, and I ride 28 mm Gatorskins. I live in NE Ohio where the snow plows destroy the streets and there are lots of potholes. The first 8 miles of every ride I do is through those city streets and all their lovely potholes. I am pretty anal about keeping them fully inflated which probably helps. I run them at about 105 psi of the 116 psi that is recommended.   P.S. My Brother-in-Law who turned me on to them has about 4,000 miles on his without a flat as well. Hope this helps"

cycling,3dyvs5,printgod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:37 2015 UTC,The biggest thing that annoys me about Gatorskins (and even the 4Seasons people are suggesting instead) is their absolutely awful ride quality. To be even somewhat comfortable you have to run them at pressures which basically guarantee pinch flats if you're not super careful over potholes and uneven pavement.  I've been running extremely light tires (Vittoria Open Corsas and now Compass Barlow Pass Extralights) for years and haven't struggled with flats even in an area plagued with goathead thorns.
cycling,3dyvs5,FalseBuddha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"OMG. For about a month,  I had flats everytime I rode. I tried a number of different tyres, to no avail. I tried gators, no flats since. They're awesome"
cycling,3dyvs5,WhyArentIHigh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:30 2015 UTC,"Once they're installed, they are awesome. Getting them on is a bit of work though, sometimes. They can be a bit slippery in the rain though. Still, better than fixing flats in the rain, to me. I don't think I've had flats with my gatorskins until they were seriously worn down."
cycling,3dyvs5,Gneisbaard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:42:45 2015 UTC,"I've used them for a few years, covered at least 25,000 miles on them.  They're fine in the dry, but in the wet they're not very grippy.  During winter I switch to 4seasons.  The main reason I use them is their puncture resistance.  People tell me other tyres are just as resistant, but I stick with what I know.  I very, very rarely get punctures.  I ride between 5-10,000 miles annually."
cycling,3dyvs5,ParrotofDoom,0,Tue Jul 21 07:27:14 2015 UTC,"Schwalbe Marathons > Gatorskins  But seriously, you should get some tweezers and pick out all the rocks + glass in your tire before you patch/replace your tubes - a lot of people get flats from the same tiny piece of glass."
cycling,3dyvs5,King_Big_Dick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:04 2015 UTC,"I've only had mine for about a month.  I had to step in and stretch them to get them on my wheels, but no flats.  I haven't been able to ride in the rain yet, so I can't speak to that.  So far, they ""feel"" different, but they're definitely better than my old road slicks."
cycling,3dyvs5,vman4402,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't like them as the 'grip' on them is almost non-existent. I can put down enough torque to break my rear tire away on a climb and lose balance. (I might have poor form) I use armadillo skins, then have a nice center line and outside line that sticks to pavement like glue. IMO"
cycling,3dyvs5,Not2original,7,Mon Jul 20 19:19:51 2015 UTC,You must be writing this from your break during the Tour de France. I have a hard time making these puppies skid on my fixed gear bike. Grippy as all get out.
cycling,3dyvs5,masgniw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:25 2015 UTC,"Um seriously?  They break traction in the damp with no provocation. I could get wheelspin up a particularly steep but short climb on my commute. While tyres that have actual wet grip don't have the same issue.  Same place, same bike, same rider, same pace, tyres are the only change."
cycling,3dyvs5,MTFUandPedal,3,Mon Jul 20 20:20:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, seriously. 3 years on the same pair and I've never come close to out-torquing their grip. I don't ride in the pouring rain much, but I've ridden through thin layers of snow many times with no issue.   You may put out watts like Canvendish, but my experiences have been nothing but grip for these tires."
cycling,3dyvs5,masgniw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"I'm seriously wondering if you have a magic set of gators, or have little experience of alternatives? Because our experiences are such a total polar opposite.... In a light dusting of snow I find 4seasons find grip where there just isn't any and Gators are like ice skates....  The only thing I found they were better than was bargain basement £5 each Kendas. Gators were my first new set of tyres on a cheap bottom of the range road bike. I wore out two sets.  Compared to what was on before, they were an upgrade in every way. Compared to anything vaguely decent (and even many middle of the line tyres) they are frankly just terrible....  Wish I had that power output :P"
cycling,3dyvs5,MTFUandPedal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:45:09 2015 UTC,I never had any issues with traction on Gatorskins commuting in Seattle through winter. That includes some fairly steep hills. Those bumpy textured pads at crosswalks were troublesome though.

cycling,3dzq6m,Jeeper13,5,Tue Jul 21 01:28:52 2015 UTC,Rowing. It strengthens a lot of core muscles while adding more leg and cardio work to what you're already getting on the bike.

That being said, in order to get the most out of rowing/erging, form is paramount.  I've seen extremely muscular people sit down next to me and just treat the machines like it came straight out of a crossfit lab only to pull awful splits and not get anything done.  Good stuff though, I don't row anymore but it's one of the most brutal forms of exercise (second to swimming/water polo) and kicks you to shape if you do it right."

If you weren't doing that AND moved to the right, he could have interpreted that as you being a dick and not giving him his legally required 3-feet AND being aggressive and not allowing him to pass you on the right. He was probably asking you to move to the left to allow him to pass on the right and POSSIBLY catch up to his friends who were ahead of you.

cycling,3dx1er,NativeImmigrant,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:25 2015 UTC,Actually that's not the law.  The 3 foot law says you have to give the cyclist 3 feet of clearance when passing.  The white stripe is not mentioned anywhere and has nothing to do with the law.  The only purpose of the law is to keep drivers from passing too closely.

I am the same height as you and I have a Defy 5, get a M/L. Here's the official size chart. If you're on the edge between sizes, you always want to go with the smaller one. It's easy to affix a longer stem if you want a more stretched position. Fitting a shorter stem than stock makes the steering rather fast/twitchy. If you buy a non-Giant, you want a 56cm, if you buy Giant, get M/L which would be equivalent to a 57cm."

The Allez is competitively priced, it's got decent mid-spec components that aren't as good as the Giant Defy, but doesn't cost nearly as much, the specialized frames are fantastic and look great, so if you did end up wanting to upgrade in the future, you can keep the frame with you.  The Hoy has a step up in terms of gears but I prefer the frame and wheels of the allez, the giant defy seems like overkill for someone just starting.  Bike sizing is tricky, for someone 6ft + I thought you'd be riding 58cm+, but the shop assistants probably know best and if you buy in store, you can likely get it properly fitted and maybe have a test ride to find the perfect match."

Tell us the year and model of bike (or better yet, look up the stack and reach numbers yourself).  Also give us your height and pants inseam to give an idea if you're long legged or built like a dwarf. Without seeing how far out of whack you are now, there is no way anyone can give you feedback on how to correct it.  Is your goal aerodynamics for racing, or comfort for long rides? Sounds like the latter, but clarify that as well.  Just putting the spacers back in to raise the bars may help the pressure, but who knows. Or maybe move the seat back on the rails to decrease the effective seat post angle and make it more like road geometry than TT geometry. Lots to try before switching out hardware, but in the end it may be required."
cycling,3dyfkk,swingbaby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say go back to your LBS and complain about the fit of the bike.  My LBS allows for multiple fits.  One initial fit, another after a few rides, and another after a couple hundred miles.  They figure, after a couple hundred, you've gotten your position right and have the core strength to sit properly.  Any other pain or discomfort must be due to bike fit."
cycling,3dyfkk,vman4402,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"This is impossible for anyone to answer without details on your bike, your body geometry, fitness level etc.  I would guess that that the shop set you up for a racing position. Often bikes come with the steerer tubes cut very short which, along with small frames being in fashion, make for an aggressive riding posture. The +17 degree stem will certainly help if the issue is a too low riding position. Other than that I agree with othrr posters that you should return to the shop with your concerns and have them address the issue.  Handlebar width is more of a taste than fit issue. Although, 38 cm is a bit narrow (42 cm is more standard)."
cycling,3dyfkk,_Ymodos_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"How well reputed is this shop in your area?  I'm wondering because $100 is a bit steep for a stem, and most of the shops in my area will swap stems with a new bike purchase, either for free or for a nominal fee ($10).  Even if you have a fancy road bike you don't need a carbon stem, and you should be able to get decent aluminum ones for between $15-50 each.  I would consider getting a second opinion fit from another shop if you can.  Sometimes a shop's fitter just isn't that good.  I went through this struggle when eventually I realized the fitter was giving me bad advice (ie telling me to change saddle position based on reach issues) contrary to commonly accepted fit techniques.  I found the shop in town that had the best reputation and paid them for a fit and I have no regrets."
cycling,3dyfkk,i_speak_the_truf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"You don't need to spend anything like that much on a stem or bars to get a good fit. Decent stems and bars can be found for around $20-30 a piece. Check out Nashbar, Amazon, ebay etc. just make sure your bars and stem are compatible diameter and your stem fits your steerer tube.  Wider bars and a shorter/higher stem would probably help.  Scout around youtube for fitting videos and do a basic fit yourself.   Cleats  Assuming you are using clipless pedals/cleats, take some masking tape, put it along the side of your shoe where the ball of your foot sits. Take a pen and mark the centre of where the ball of your foot is.  Take another piece of tape and put it along the inside edge of your pedal, clip into your pedal and mark on the cleat where the center of the pedal spindle is. Now adjust the cleat until you align the two marks, this positions the ball of your foot over the pedal spindle.  Saddle fore/aft  Set your fore/aft saddle position using a plumb line. With your pedals level to the ground, hold the line in the centre ""dip"" in your knee and drop it down. Adjust your saddle back and fore until the line dissects the pedal spindle.    Saddle Height  Put the pedals at 12 and 6 o'clock and put the heel of your foot on the pedal with your foot flat. Your leg should be pretty much locked out without your hips rocking when you pedal. Another way is to take a long level and straddle it as if it were a top tube. Get it level then mark on a wall its position. Measure the mark from the floor and deduct 10cm from that number. Set your saddle height to this new number when measured from the center of the bottm bracket to the top of the saddle, along the seat tube.  Reach  Now that your positioned correctly in the saddle you can play with the reach. Basic rule of thumb for getting a ballpark good reach is to sit in your riding position with your hands comfortably on the hoods. Sight through the bars and look at the hub of your front wheel. If the hub is obscured by the bars you're in the right ballpark. If the hubs are in front of the bars your reach is too short, if they're behind it's too long.  Ideally you're looking for a roughly 90° angle between your torso and your arms when your riding on the hoods, with about a 15° bend at the elbows. If you feel like you're stretching to reach the levers, you need a shorter/more angled stem.  TL:DR You need a shorter, more angled stem and wider (44cm) bars."

cycling,3dyx5n,j4n3st,6,Mon Jul 20 17:41:27 2015 UTC,Ulnar nerve compression is causing the numbness. Having an elbow in a prolonged bent position can cause this. Many on here will suggest a bike fit (which is legit); I'll provide the alternative that helped me: form. Maintaining proper form is essential. The basics being a majority of your weight should be on the seat and your core should be holding you up. Your back should be straight with slight leeway for bending but in general you don't want to be holding your self up on the handlebars.
cycling,3dyx5n,grizzly_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly that. A bike fit might be useful, also consider thicker bar tape and / or good mits, but ultimately you need to reduce the pressure on your hands by getting the weight off, this means a strong core.   I suffer from this on long rides (over 4 hours), I used to get it on shorter rides but now it only kicks in when I'm tired and my form drops off. As soon as a notice it I can now alleviate by relaxing my shoulders and arms and focusing on a better posture on the saddle."
cycling,3dyx5n,JellyLegsMick,2,Tue Jul 21 10:59:26 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that the bike fit should be a function of how much torque you make on the bike.  If you compare the position of track bikes, time-trial and triathlon bikes, road bikes, touring bikes, hybrids and fitness bikes and finally beach cruisers and Dutch commuter bikes, you see that the upper body is bent over much more when the torque levels are really high, and as you consider riding styles which use lower powers the posture goes more to vertical.  If you are resting too much weight on your hands it may mean you should have your bars a little higher and maybe a little closer to you.  What kind of bike do you have?  One of the advantages of drop bars is the ability to move your hands to different positions (tops, corners, hoods, drops) for different purposes or just to relieve your hands."
cycling,3dyx5n,miyata_fan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:32 2015 UTC,It's my dad's mountain bike.  I'm a small female so it probably isn't the best fit for me.  I think the handlebars are probably too far away and it's possible that I'm putting too much weight/pressure on my hands because the seat is pretty uncomfortable.
cycling,3dyx5n,JellyLegsMick,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe try a shorter stem, and try adjusting the saddle to move it forward so your reach is reduced."

However, even new, a good bike can be had for < $1000.  Especially if you find a last-years holdover, or wait for the bike stores to put stock on sale in late Autumn.  Sure, at the sub-$1000 level, you're going to have Sora or Tiagra, but the fact of the matter is that Shimano equipment is well made up and down the line.  The lower stuff is a little heavier, maybe doesn't shift as snappy, but unless you're racing, the minor differences really don't matter.  Also, in a given bike line ... the frames really don't change much from the bottom to the top ... paint scheme, groupset, etc...  You're $1000 budget will get you a good entry-level road bike in a major name brand.  That same $1000 (or less) will get you a mid-level used road bike, but do expect to spend a little extra in a tuneup and fitting (swapping out stem, bars, seat, etc... to make sure you're comfortable).  As you're just getting into it, I'd stick with aluminum or steel ... Carbon's nice, but really it's more than most recreational cyclists really need.

cycling,3dwodv,shdwghst457,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:58 2015 UTC,"We do have a website. http://cycleloft.com/ I don't know what we have in store at the moment as I am not at work when I'm writing this, however, we can order any Specialized/ Trek bike."
cycling,3dwodv,GodSubstitute,2,Wed Jul 22 01:04:46 2015 UTC,My Specialized Allez Sport Triple (Tiagra-equipped) cost around $900 and has been with me since 2004. I love my bike but the front shifter has never been quite right; I largely stay in the middle gear up front because of it. I imagine things have gotten better in the last decade though.
cycling,3dwodv,shdwghst457,2,Mon Jul 20 16:30:18 2015 UTC,If you're so inclined a new front dérailleur has to be one of the cheapest swaps you can do.
cycling,3dwodv,dingusbattus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"What exactly does Tiagra equipped mean?i understand it's a brand, but does that mean that all the components in the bike are Tiagra brand?"
cycling,3dwodv,markhewitt1978,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:15 2015 UTC,"Tiagra is one of Shimano's product lines, such as 105 (below Tiagra) and Ultegra (above Tiagra). What I mean is that my bike has Tiagra shifters and derailleurs.  Edit: I think I'm incorrect in my 105 > Tiagra > Ultegra order. I think it's actually Tiagra > 105 > Ultegra."
cycling,3dwodv,Steptafu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty sure Tiagra is a grade above 105 because if you look at the different bikes available from Trek and Specialized at least you can see that the bikes at a higher price point have Tiagra.  That is not necessarily indicative of how good the products are. That being said, in general two bikes are around the same price point chances are they have similar components.  EDIT: I'm wrong, 105 is better."

cycling,3dwodv,printgod,2,Mon Jul 20 05:55:56 2015 UTC,"Trek 1 series, Giant Defy, Merida Ride, and Cube Peloton are the bikes I'd be looking for. Popular, reliable, reputable manufacturers. My advice: don't spend all your budget on the bike - keep £100-150 back for accessories like shorts/jerseys, tools, pedals & shoes etc.  I personally ride a Trek 1.2 and it's great. Not the lightest, stiffest, or the fanciest in terms of components, but it's perfect for me as a relatively new weekend rider."
cycling,3dwg4o,Anne_of_Avonlea,4,Mon Jul 20 02:38:04 2015 UTC,"That depends upon what your goals are for biking.  That will be fine for short trips to run errands ... a little cruise around town, but you won't be wanting to take long trips on a bike like that.  You could spend a lot less than $350 on a bike that fulfills those needs.  EDIT:  Just noticed the asking price is $200.  That's probably a fair price for that bike."

Also, the chain guard would be nice for wearing jeans/long pants while riding but will make chain maintenance difficult. Other than those few points 200$ seems like a fair price for that bike!"

cycling,3dvz41,BurntBanana86,6,Mon Jul 20 00:04:57 2015 UTC,In many cases the answer is no.   In some cases it could be weight (an arguable issue at best) and in other cases it is build quality most notably in seams and stems. I have played around with both and have only found a very small number I won't buy again.
cycling,3dvz41,Nightshade400,7,Mon Jul 20 00:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, stay away from Slime tubes.   They are a great idea in concept, but the tubes themselves are garbage.   I've had two fail at the valve stem seams. All the self healing goo in the world won't help that failure."
cycling,3dvz41,Gnascher,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"Funny you said that because that is one brand I will never use again, same issue and another is that if it gets a flat and the slime fails you can't get a patch to stick to the tube."

cycling,3dvz41,Electronical,5,Mon Jul 20 14:20:37 2015 UTC,"Sometimes weight, but more importantly quality control. MEC could end up with a batch of sketchy tubes, that are more prone to failure. In general though the MEC ones are good, just avoid the Canadian Tire ones."

cycling,3dvz41,mountainslayer,3,Mon Jul 20 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"Cheap tubes tend to be more porous than higher quality tubes. And generally use less rubber. Meaning they don't hold air as long, and don't stretch as far. Will cheaper tubes work fine? yes."
cycling,3dvz41,Brodude5,3,Mon Jul 20 01:13:05 2015 UTC,"Whatever you get, avoid Forte Tubes (a Performance Bike brand). Those things will lose air like crazy.

cycling,3dvz41,kwaaaaaaaaa,3,Mon Jul 20 04:17:36 2015 UTC,"I like the MEC tubes because the packaging is more compact and easier to stuff in a jersey pocket.  The boxed ones take up more space and tend to come unravelled eventually.  Unless you're buying lightweight racing tubes, there's really no difference between brands."
cycling,3dvz41,mountainslayer,2,Mon Jul 20 17:51:08 2015 UTC,I've found that valves tend to go bad more often on cheap tubes.
cycling,3dvz41,spike,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:54 2015 UTC,"I've always used Schwalbe inner tubes, but switched to more cheaper non-branded inner tubes. For each Schwalbe inner tube I can buy 6 non-branded tubes. Only difference is in the butyl material which doesn't hold the air as well in the cheaper versions. Failures of the valves don't really matter, since it's cheaper to just change the inner tube for a new one."
cycling,3dvz41,Electronical,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the best brand is, but of the ones I've tried, Continental have been pretty poor performers despite being a famous brand. I've had good luck with Kenda tubes, Bontrager, and some no-name ones. It probably varies over time as well. When shopping for tubes in person, look for those with minimal seams which do not protrude much. This makes them easier to patch when punctured."

All gloves get pretty nasty after a while anyway, and I've found that a trip through the washer is usually ""the beginning of the end"" for even ""nice"" gloves ... so I try not to spend much money on them and treat them as semi-disposable.

cycling,3dujn5,rabinabo,4,Sun Jul 19 20:54:33 2015 UTC,What exactly is the issue. It's usually a matter of getting one side fully on then feeding in the tube at the same time as pushing the tyre onto the rim.
cycling,3dujn5,Nightshade400,3,Sun Jul 19 18:20:44 2015 UTC,"First, I would say practice will eventually make it easier.  To help get the tire bead on, I've heard of people applying talc to the bead. Also, squeezing the tire as you go, putting it in the center, reduces the tension. And leave the area around the valve for last.  If all else fails, here's a tool that I've heard about, but have no experience: https://patchnride.com. It sounds too gimmicky to work well, but you could try it."
cycling,3dujn5,rabinabo,3,Sun Jul 19 19:14:59 2015 UTC,"Neat idea but it looks like it has way too many variables it can't possibly account for such as thorns that vanish making it impossible to locate a puncture without removing the tire, wheel slippage vs tube placement etc.  Sure if you hit a screw, nail or staple then you are probably pretty set for repair, but around here those are a lot less common than a goathead that vanishes once it has done it's damage.   Not trying to be a dick just saying it is pretty limited in its application."

The vast majority occur in the middle of the bone and can successfully be treated non operatively even if they are a little displaced, but patients can feel (or see) a bump there forever.  The old rule was to fix them if they its displaced or overlapped by more than 2 cm, but some studies in the last 10 years have suggested that we be more aggressive about fixing them with plates and screws in overhead athletes / workers.  Usually patients just wear a sling for 1-2 weeks for comfort, and get it moving as pain allows.  Takes about 6 weeks to heal, most return to activities shortly after that.

cycling,3dtrc7,Jab239,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:23:17 2015 UTC,"First, make sure you see an orthopedic surgeon ASAP.  Totally depends on how bad the fracture was.  Most are either minimally or nondisplaced.  In those cases its recommended to just wear a sling for a week or so for comfort, then get out of it asap and get the elbow moving (elbows get stiff quick), especially pronation / supination of the hand.  It usually takes about 6 weeks to heal, most people return to full activities shortly after that.  If its a pretty crunched up fracture, it could need surgery to fix it to avoid post-traumatic arthritis and stiffness in the future."

cycling,3dtrc7,MilkTheFrog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:28:59 2015 UTC,"Did exactly the same thing at Christmas. They were worried about a scaphoid fracture too but a follow up x ray showed that wasn't a problem so they got rid of the wrist splint after that, it's mainly just a precaution. Pain wasn't too bad for me, just had plenty of ibuprofen. Dunno about your doctors but i didn't get a cast, they said it wasn't going to cause any damage by moving it and since it had bled into the joint it was more important to keep it moving or else i could permanently lose some movement in it. I found a leaflet that really helped with this, if it's the same for you. Took about two or three weeks once i was able to start doing these stretches for normal movement to return.  http://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/files%5C101109radialhead.pdf  Just take it easy for a bit when you do get back on the bike and you should be fine. Another note - this type of injury is usually caused by landing on an outstretched arm. If you can learn how to crash properly you'll avoid anything like this in future with a bit of luck, i know you might only have a split second to act but if you can keep hold of the handlebars initially and try to roll rather than stopping straight away you'll save yourself a lot of trouble."

Mu thumb was hurting right in the spot of the scaphoid bone so they wanted to not risk it and splinted me up. i have a followup in a week with an orthopedic surgeon to reevaluate and take it from there. did you have pain in that area? when did you remove the wrist splint.   my elbow/arm definitely are sore and uncomfortable (happened about 24hrs ago). i can barely rotate or move my arm / bend my elbow. is this normal? everyone says the elbow gets stiff quickly so am i supposed to start exercising it now or wait? what did you do? the pdf doesn't really say.  as far as falling....exactly what i did. ill have to practice in a safe area with padding so i can learn how to fall :) - most frustrating the nypd parked their cars all along the bike path so it was closed and i had to go on the pedestrian walk when i then hit a groove in the road and lost control. should have never been there to begin with. i still dont get how i lost control (rained earlier probably didnt help) but holy hell did all this hurt  *pardon typo/grammar    one handed and the wrong one"
cycling,3dtrc7,stravadarius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:27:24 2015 UTC,"Heh, well i don't know about ""practising"" falling but just try to bear in mind - keep your hands on the handlebars. I did have some wrist pain but i think it was just a bruise. When i went back the nurse said the splint was mainly for overnight, if you can take it off without too much pain then you probably should.  The lack of movement sounds very similar to what i had. The advice is usually to start the stretches as soon as you can bear it, i think i managed it 2-4 days after the accident. Not a fun thing to have to do three times a day but there you go. I found them easier to do against a wall, using my body weight to put a reasonable amount of pressure on it. When you first start you probably won't be able to stretch it out completely, but be patient and keep at it, should be back to normal in a couple of weeks. Your doctor will probably tell you to make another appointment if you're still having trouble with it."

A lot of my club's riders use it so we harass each other and shame each other into riding if anyone is slacking.  As for the routes, I like the function because so can plan a route and see the elevation, so, if I'm riding with beginners, I can plan accordingly.  I keep my phone in my bib's rear pocket. I pretty much know where I'm going and basically memorize the turns. If I'm on a new route, or, doing 60+ miles and there are a lot of turns, I'll just take a look every 10 miles or so and memorize the next four or five turns.

So I live with the breadcrumb method (e.g. red line plotted on map, which I follow).

Strava would be a well suited product to do this- and I think the risk is putting high attention grabbing distractions in the eyes of cyclists that should be focusing on the road? So google maps has cycling specific routes- which works well- and I've used cycling mounts on my bike- but I've also just plopped the phone in my jersey with volume up and used the voice commands while running strava in the background. I've recently procured an apple watch and the haptic notifications combined with the easy to read visuals actually work very well too. So I can use strava for its own thing and the watch feels like it's doing the map work. So I'd say that's a good couple of options to explore. I'm not a fan of the Garmin Technologies so I can't say what that's like.
cycling,3dsflu,justasack,2,Sun Jul 19 13:36:35 2015 UTC,FYI I just went out for my first ride with Ride WIth GPS and you should check it out. It requires some legwork before you ride (ie planning the routes including cue sheets from a web browser) but then it worked amazingly.   Only odd thing was that it wouldn't tell you how much longer you had left on the route.

It can link to your ridewithgps.com account and use routes that you create there. It has a few bugs, but it's worked well for me. I think it has a free trial period and then there's a one-time fee to unlock it. I think it was about $10. So far it has been a good solution for me, but I do eventually want to get a garmin with built-in navigation."
cycling,3dsflu,la_neva_dies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"What I've found that works quite well is the app OsmAnd (I use it on Android, but I'm pretty sure it's on iOS as well). It's a free sat-nav app, with offline map and offline turn-by-turn features. What I tend to do is create new routes using Strava, then simply export the gpx files, load them into OsmAnd, mount my phone on the stem and leave Strava running in the background whilst having the screen on OsmAnd. Works great for the most part, does drain the phone battery quite quickly though as the screen is always on so you may want to take a portable battery charger just in case!"
cycling,3dsflu,IAmA_realmermaid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"I use the mapmaking function solely to sort out mileage and a rough idea of elevation for climbs.   If you need turn by turn you can shorthand note and stick it to your bars or top tube with tape, real simple. If thats not what you want then you can program the route into Google maps and use their turn by turn, kind of a pain and picks some shit routes if you don't manually create the entire route."

This way, if anyone posts the word ""Diamondback"" or any other keywords, you'll immediately get an email. Good luck getting your bicycle back!"
cycling,3ds4g2,Lemkie,6,Sat Jul 18 22:47:04 2015 UTC,"They are mountain bike shoes and pedals, but many people prefer to use this style on road bikes.   The advantage of mountain bike pedals shoes it's that they are designed to allow you to walk in them."
cycling,3ds4g2,Gnascher,3,Sat Jul 18 23:43:27 2015 UTC,Thanks.  These are pretty hard to walk in tough.  They're very stiff Is that normal?
cycling,3ds4g2,Evil_Bonsai,5,Sun Jul 19 00:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yes. Biking shoes are intentionally stiff so that all your energy goes into the pedal stroke. Basically, most MTB shoes will have cleats on the bottom (like a really aggressive hiking or soccer shoe, depending on their being casual or race oriented.) A road bike shoe is FLAT on the bottom. Trust that waling in a MTB shoes is much easier than a road bike shoe.  Also, road bike pedals are usually one-sided whereas mtb pedals are two-sided. Some people use MTB shoes/pedals for road cycling because shoes are easier to walk in and the pedals are a little easier to clip into, though they will be slightly heavier than their road dedicated counterparts."

cycling,3ds4g2,adeathsovicious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:51:20 2015 UTC,I started using them when I started commuting and I felt it helped. It's kinda hard to quantify how much it helped since at the time I was also getting stronger since I went from biking a couple times a month to every day and for longer distances. I just use mountain bike pedals and the shoe I use is designed to walk around as well even more so than a typical mountain bike shoe so I'm far from using a very stiff setup.

So for the average consumer, they may be the most appropriate purchase. This set up is purpose built for mountain biking but definitely does the trick for road if you're a beginner- it'll also be a fire sky introduction to clipping in and out, giving you Mobility off the bike while traveling. If you went with a traditional road clip you wouldn't be able to walk around much, certainly not comfortably, and would likely damage/wear out the clip quickly."

Not that it's necessarily a bad thing, but MTB can be rough on pedals and new SPD pedals like the M520's (which replaced these 515's) can be had for around $21. The 520's are built like tanks though, I'd imagine the 515's were similar."

cycling,3dqkye,_Ymodos_,3,Sat Jul 18 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"I run the ultegra hubs to open pros. 32 hole double butted spokes. Love them. The only difference between the DA hubs and Ultegra is the titanium freehub body and weight, which in my opinion don't mean anything. It's not that big of a difference and plus the hub isn't the rotational weight, the wheel is. So, IMO scratch the DA to open pros and save a little cash and get the Ultegra to Open pros. Unfortunately I don't have any experience with the other rims. The one thing I can say about the Ksyrium Elites is that they are great rims. However, I believe they are proprietary bladed spokes which makes it hard to replace if they break. Living in the west coast and Mavic is located in the east coast, it takes a while to replace them. Just my thoughts."

cycling,3dqkye,Adamarr,2,Sat Jul 18 16:46:00 2015 UTC,Can you explain how the riding surface and the suggested depth of the rim are related? Stuff like this is what I'm trying to understand.
cycling,3dqkye,dandar4600,3,Sat Jul 18 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"On flat surfaces, ~80% of your energy is put into overcoming wind resistance. Deeper dish aero wheels improve your aerodynamics, and once you're up to speed (if it even does make a difference) the extra weight is small potatoes.    Whereas climbing (and this is going to depend on the grade and your speed as well) it's more like 80% of energy overcoming gravity, so lighter wheels make more of a difference. Although on a light grade you might be able to trundle fast enough to get the same benefit with deeper wheels.    *note, numbers are vague recollections, may not be entirely accurate"

My core is much stronger, my legs are MUCH stronger and don't compensate my moments in other muscle groups anymore. My posture at my desk is still shit. But I don't suffer from back injuries not nearly as often anymore to the point where I don't consider myself as ""having a bad back"". It was life changing and I'll likely never stop riding because it's changed my health and outlook so dramatically"

cycling,3dp6go,consistentstrength,10,Sat Jul 18 16:33:34 2015 UTC,I think this is a legitimate concern.  My PT said the same things to me.  You have to strengthen and stretch to counteract time spent on the bike.
cycling,3dp6go,consistentstrength,3,Sat Jul 18 04:05:50 2015 UTC,Balance it with lifting weights and you should be fine. It takes a lot of miles to counteract a few sets of heavy deadlifts per week.
cycling,3dp6go,marcobartolli,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:26:58 2015 UTC,Really? Do you know of any more detailed info on this? I do some kind of deadlift variation twice a week but figured the cycling would really outweigh that.
cycling,3dp6go,Foobarzot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:36:24 2015 UTC,"I don't have any detailed info, but from observing how my own body changes with lifting vs. riding, it's pretty clear that muscle mass/strength are largely gained via lifting. Any of the posterior chain exercises (deadlift, low bar squat, glute-ham raises, Roman chair, etc.) should offset the quad dominant aspects of cycling.  Just make sure you're using proper form, as rounded back deadlifts aren't going to help with any of your goals."

cycling,3dp6go,fn1889m,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:01:56 2015 UTC,Any recommendations for post-ride stretching routines?
cycling,3dp6go,AlvaSt-Snow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"You should try to adjust your current bike, if you have one, instead of buying a new one, until you find the geometry that works for you, if there is one. For distance riding, it is recommended that one relieve fatigue by standing up to give the seat-muscles a break, and changing hand positions, back angles, etc. If you do so regularly, it does help tremendously.   You should focus on strengthening your core, and try to be moderate/gentle on how hard you bike - leg muscles stay stronger than back muscles, so after a break from cycling, many strain their backs. Doing a lot of cycling before you have your core muscles in pretty good shape would probably not be the best thing you could do.  I know someone who has made a conscious effort to keep from rolling the hips (sorry, not the best explanation) after seeing a physiognomist (Dr. looks at motion) - after doing some things wrong, and straining some muscles. Took some mental concentration for awhile, but now seems to be fairly standard.  You can work more than the quads by pushing down/back as the pedal is at the bottom, or if you have clipless or toe cages, pulling up. In general, that works the back muscles more than just pushing down."
cycling,3dp6go,SmartToaster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"I find my core is much stronger with cycling, and that helps my posture. I do not see how moderate rec. cycling could hurt your muscles. But nothing wrong with mixing it with weights, even a home set of dumb bells."

Biopace had the largest radius offset so that your leg's momentum would carry you through the dead spot; it almost had the smallest radius for your powerstroke. Modern rings put the largest radius where your strongest muscles can push the extra resistance and have the smallest radius in the dead spot where your weaker muscles, like your hip flexors, can carry you through."

However, there's no third party data that suggests that. At least since the last time I looked into it, which admittedly has been a while.  'The credible tests and research that has been done is inconclusive, according to Kerrison: “Crank-based power measurement systems [e.g. SRM, Quarq] appear to over-report power when using Osymetric rings, which is probably due to the variable angular velocity of the crank throughout the pedal revolution. In other words, power reads higher, but this does not correspond with an increase in the power actually being generated by the rider.”'  http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/osymetric-chainrings-do-they-work-28044"

That gives you the widest range of gearing and the tradeoff isn't huge.  However, you say your commute is pretty flat, so maybe you'd be better off getting either the compact (50/34) with the 11-25 cassette for slightly cleaner rear shifting or the double (52/39) with the 12-28 cassette for slightly cleaner front shifting due to the smaller jumps between cogs/chainrings.   I'd compare the current lowest gear you use on your commute to the 34/25 low gear.  If you can make your commute easily in 34/25 then I'd get the compact double and 11-25 cassette option.  That will get you the cleanest rear shifting."

But if you ever race or ride around at your limit in groups of competitive riders, sure, you could survive with friction shifters on the downtube. But once you feel what it's like to shift instantly without even thinking about it once every few pedal strokes while standing and desperately sprinting up a hill because it's the only way to hang onto the back of a group that's about to drop you, trust me, most people fall in love with integrated indexed shifting. There's a reason 99.9% of racers use them. If fast, at-the-limit riding isn't for you, then I'm sure friction is just fine.  edit: said index, meant friction"

It has minor advantages of not needing to be as finely adjusted and you can do arbitrarily large shifts.  One of my friends saw me do a shift from one end of the cluster to the other.  It caught his eye because the slack part of the chain bounced around quite a bit; I hadn't thought about the fact that you can't do that on a brifter.  Of course, on my old bike that's only a 2:1 change, on a modern cluster I'm not sure you'd ever want to go that far in a single shift.  On the other hand a nice modern brifter and associated derailleur make very nice crisp shifts.  Compare the lateral stiffness of a modern derailleur to your old unit (try to wiggle the end of the tensioner from side-to-side) - there's a huge difference with the old one being relatively floppy (it didn't need to be as stiff)."
cycling,3dls3q,miyata_fan,2,Fri Jul 17 15:32:45 2015 UTC,Quite a few people like friction shifters for the front as it can be tricky to set up the indexing on those. Never met anyone who prefers friction for the rear though.

I recently had some issues with my front derailleur not shifting responsively into the big ring and tried for a while to tune it myself (it was futile).  I eventually caved and paid the LBS to do it and now it shifts great.  Still, I would prefer a system where you just adjust the limit screws and can slam the front derailleur back and forth without worrying about having perfect indexing.  On the rear though you could never get me to give up indexing, especially not with a 9+ gear cluster.  The current Sora 3500 shifts almost instantly in the rear and allows shifting down two gears at a time.  Even my old hybrid with Altus 7-speed parts shifted ""instantly"" in the rear (but the front shifting the the indexed triple was a hot mess)."

It has a much nicer feel and almost never needs any kind of adjustment  Also one more thing. 2003 Sora was a pretty bad groupset and not a good benchmark to judge index shifting.

cycling,3dkfig,somanybadgers,33,Fri Jul 17 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"Here's some rules of thumb for you to follow:   You should probably be in a lower gear than you think you should.  A fast, steady, light-feeling pedaling rhythm is better than ""slow and heavy"".  Find the pedaling speed where you find yourself bouncing in the saddle, then kick it back a notch ... that's where you should be. The front gears are called ""chain rings"".  You have three of them, so you have a ""triple"" crankset.  The outermost one is called either the ""big ring"" or ""outer ring"".  The middle one is usually just referred to as the ""middle ring"". The innermost, gear is called the ""inner ring"", ""little ring"", or ""granny gear"". The rear gears are referred to as ""cogs"".  The whole stack of gears is collectively called the ""cassette"". Regardless of whether we're talking about the crank rings or cassette cogs, they are numbered from ""easiest to hardest"".  That is, from the inside to the outside.  Up front, the littlest chainring is #1, the middle ring is #2 and the big ring is #3.  On the cassette, the biggest cog (closest to the spokes) is #1, and the little guy is #8. You have an 8-speed bike.  The layman's convention is to multiply the # of crank rings by the # of cogs in the cassette.  This is just marketing.  You don't have 24 speeds, as there's a lot of overlap.  So, instead, we just talk about how many cogs are in the cassette.  For reference, most cassettes on the market these days have between 8 and 11 cogs ... your's has 8. You can think of the front rings as ""gross adjustment"", and the cassette cogs as fine tuning.  Most of your shifting will occur on the rear.  The big ring and middle ring are probably going to be your bread and butter.  The big ring is probably where you should be when you're cruising, and you'll probably be on cogs 4-6 ... you'll hit 7-8 when you're really flying down a hill.  When encountering hills or headwinds, drop to the middle ring.  Again, you'll probably be on cogs 4-6, but you can go lower as the climb gets longer or tougher.  Remember ... adjust your gearing to maintain a good, high cadence and light pedal effort.  When the going gets REALLY tough, drop to that little chain ring ... you'll be on cogs 1, 2 & 3 when you're using ""granny gear"". Cross-chaining is bad.  In general, you want to select gear combinations that result in a relatively straight chainline.  When on the big ring, don't go below cog #3.  When on the middle ring, stick to cogs 1-6.  When on the little ring, stick with cogs 1-3.  It's OK if you occasionally find yourself in a cross-chained situation ... it's not going to cause immediate damage, but if you do it frequently it will cause accelerated wear on the drivetrain.   So, to boil it down.  Choose your front chainring for the type of terrain you're currently on.  The big ring is primarily for flats, downhill and very light uphill. The middle ring is for longer or steeper climbs, or if you're fighting a strong headwind.  The little ring is for the most extreme climbing or when you're just ""out of gas"".  Once you've selected the front ring, use the rear cogs to make minor adjustments to adapt to moderate changes in grade, wind, etc...  Your goal is to select a gear combination that will allow you fairly easilyvturn your pedals somewhere between 80 - 95 rpm.  Finally, try and avoid gear combinations that put the chain into opposite extremes, as this stresses the driveline.  EDIT: Thanks for the gold!"
cycling,3dkfig,Gnascher,3,Fri Jul 17 03:41:28 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the full rundown on things. It's all starting to make a lot more sense to me.
cycling,3dkfig,SgtBaxter,2,Fri Jul 17 04:27:26 2015 UTC,"Also, since you have a triple you'll probably want to spend a lot of time in the middle chainring up front. Save the small ring for steep hills. Save the big ring for fast flat sections. Use the middle for everything else."
cycling,3dkfig,bikesandpipes,3,Fri Jul 17 11:55:19 2015 UTC,This was an excellent write up. Thank you!
cycling,3dkfig,MisuVir,4,Fri Jul 17 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"mild fear that I'll damage something   It is called cross-chaining and it won't immediately damage anything.  It potentially increases component wear over time. Just avoid the extreme gear combinations. My rule of thumb is that if the front is in low gear, I avoid the high end of the rear gears. If the front is in high gear, I avoid the low end of the rear gears.   Is this normal/safe for the bike?   Yes, that's normal. It is less to do with your speed and more to do with how fast you're pedalling. When changing gears, you ideally want to be pedalling at a decent rate. This usually means shifting gear before you need to. Shift down before you start going up a hill."
cycling,3dkfig,reddituser97531,3,Fri Jul 17 00:11:26 2015 UTC,I always attack the hill with an unrealistic sense of optimism and then find myself struggling to down shift in time before I stall out. One day though...
cycling,3dkfig,MisuVir,5,Fri Jul 17 03:17:34 2015 UTC,The worst feeling is when you stop moving forward and start rolling backwards while simultaneously losing balance. :D
cycling,3dkfig,reddituser97531,2,Fri Jul 17 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"That moment when you try to shift, but the gears aren't spinning enough to grab the chain."
cycling,3dkfig,SgtBaxter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:31:07 2015 UTC,"What's funny - all the guys in our club who have race experience use all gear combos and could care less about cross-chaining. It's only the recreational riders who seem to have any concern with it. Of course, the race guys know how to shift properly under load so it's not really much of an issue."
cycling,3dkfig,Gnascher,2,Fri Jul 17 11:58:27 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how frequently you want to replace your chain and cassette. Race guys do this often, so they could care less...   Cross chaining doesn't cause immediate damage, but it adds up.   Also,  ""little/little"" cross chaining can result in a slack chain and increase the probability of throwing the chain."
cycling,3dkfig,MisuVir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it is one of those things where in theory it is bad, but in practice it doesn't really matter that much. It isn't like you're running in those gear combos all the time anyway."
cycling,3dkfig,markhewitt1978,2,Fri Jul 17 12:12:44 2015 UTC,"Quite so. A lot of people are obsessed about making a chain last 10,000 miles, when if you're cross chaining it might only last 5,000 miles, but for the price of chains what are you going to save? $5 ?"

cycling,3dkfig,Jevo_,2,Fri Jul 17 12:36:15 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that when I'm going fast, changing gears is quick and fluid; when I'm going slower (like climbing a small hill), changing gears feels forced and I can physically feel the ""bump"" from changing gears. Is this normal/safe for the bike?   The reason this happens, is likely that your cadence is low, and you're pressing hard on the pedals. You need to keep the chain moving to change gear, but it shouldn't be under load so to speak, because that will cause this kind of bump. If you let up for half a rotation as you shift gears, the gear change should be as smooth as it is normally. It will likely take some time to get this technique dialled in, so try and practice it. If you try to ride with a higher cadence as well, it'll be easier to do it, since you are already applying less torque, so you won't feel like you are losing as much momentum when you ease off for a second."
cycling,3dkfig,markhewitt1978,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:07:23 2015 UTC,"They are talking about cross chaining. Where the chain on the front has too steep an angle to where the chain is on the back.  For your setup it's quite simple really. 1 on the front, avoid 8 on the back 2 on the front, avoid 1 and 8 on the back 3 on the front, avoid 1 on the back  I'm sure you're aware that 1-1 will be your easiest gear - for climbing big slopes. 3-8 your hardest gear, for going down the other side.  Stick to that you won't go far wrong. You won't immediately break anything if riding in 1-8, but you will wear your chain and since there's a big overlap in the gears then something like 2-4 will probably give you a similar ratio without cross chaining.   For question 2) again it's not going to damage anything, just wear it out a little, in general when changing gear you need to be turning the cranks, but not putting a lot of force through the pedals while the change happens."
cycling,3dkfig,lescannon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:39:01 2015 UTC,"You should have noticed that changing the rear is much quicker than changing the front, so you want to be early on making the front easier when climbing hills, then while you are pedaling hard on the hill, you are usually only changing the rear. I still guess wrong sometimes on when to change the front, so don't get too down on that, especially on a hill you haven't ridden before."
