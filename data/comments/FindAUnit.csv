We're a huge advocate of learning by doing, of learning by personal research and conversation, and critical evaluation. If you don't want to learn in your own time, then you don't have to and you will still naturally (slowly) improve over time.  This doesn't mean we don't have a pile of essays and posts on how to do things and we're willing to dig to find materials for people who want to learn more (That means field manuals from old militaries, military science books and pamphlets and the like).  We always have a group After Action Report at the end of our sessions to see where we're going wrong and what we can do to improve.  We've been through a lot, and have spawned a handful of strong units led by guys who cut their teeth with us.  Above all things, We want people to come and play and have a good time. I want to meet friends I can relax with at the end of a long day.

FA doesn't require you to have mods or you to attend every session. But there are some optional mods that benefit you, like SThud.  Sessions are ran on Sundays and Tuesdays at 19.20 UK time (That's 13.20 for CST). And in our sessions we run 4 or 5 missions, that are mainly infantry based and they last ~30 minutes each, so if you miss the start, you can still jump in the next mission, or if you want to call it a day earlier, there are no obligations to stay for all the missions.  What's more, we are all equal, if you decide to take a leadership role, go ahead, if you just want to be a ground-pounder, then be my guest, before each mission we have a slotting phase when we decide who will be who and after that there is the briefing, where the commander will decide how will we approach the mission. We like to play organized, not lone-wolfing through the thing. And if you don't know something, just ask, people will be happy to explain.

We usually get 20-40 players per mission and have knowledgeable mission makers that make quality missions. We play a mix of TvT and COOP gamemodes, and there is no obligation to show up if you have things to do. We are “relaxed realism” which means that we do not have any milsim hierarchy aside from the leadership roles chosen inside the mission.  Our only requirement for new members is that they go through a quick, casual orientation session to familiarize themselves with the basics of our mods and work out any technical issues before a mission. Our mods are very easy to download (Using BTSync or PlayWithSix) and we are able to troubleshoot your issues and get you playing if you have any problems. What sets us apart from other groups is our ability to continually get 25+ people per mission (More during the college/work year for some reason) and our quality missions.

Or don't and feel free to ignore me.  I'm a staff member in Dog Company, an Arma 3 group that's been going for about four years now in various forms.  Dog Company's an infantry-focused group that will generally be mechanized/motorized infantry squads.  We're looking for guys who want to play Arma, guys who may want to take leadership roles, guys who have a good attitude and want to have a good time.  We're not looking for an instant commitment, you'll decide that after spending some time playing alongside us.  We do ask that all applicants are 18+ however sometimes concessions are made to those who are 16-17 years old.  We don't require people to sit through a formal basic training, advanced trainings, qualifications, lectures or anything. We're a huge advocate of learning by doing, of learning by personal research and conversation, and critical evaluation. If you don't want to learn in your own time, then you don't have to and you will still naturally (slowly) improve over time.  This doesn't mean we don't have a pile of essays and posts on how to do things and we're willing to dig to find materials for people who want to learn more (That means field manuals from old militaries, military science books and pamphlets and the like).  We always have a group After Action Report at the end of our sessions to see where we're going wrong and what we can do to improve.

Sometimes we will act as roleplay elements for them on their very large operations. They usually have around 30-40 people per op.    We currently only have 1 pilot, but he's also an airline pilot in real life so he can't always be on during our contracts so we can use a backup pilot. At the moment, however, we're only using the little birds since we're a smaller PMC unit. Once we grow some more, we will consider Blackhawks.   We could really use Team Leaders and Field Supervisors.  Currently, we're mostly operating on the weekends, but we are hoping to get our public server up soon that we can play on all the time.
