pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,MKSLAYER97,2,Tue Jul 21 12:41:53 2015 UTC,"I believe, /weak."
pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,Vengeance417,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"It's not going to stay long. As frail as it is physically, its ability to completely decimate any moderately defensive team is just too much (then again, Manaphy still exists)."
pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,MKSLAYER97,3,Mon Jul 20 15:52:04 2015 UTC,"Manaphy is still capable of switching in to most attacks thanks to a very nice defensive typing in mono water and base 100 defenses which is invested in most of the time. While yes, Hoopa-U has no switchins and has tremendous power and coverage, it barely has any switchin opportunities of its own despite a base 130 SpDef (investing in bulk is a terrible idea...) and no staying in power thanks to no resistances due to its Dark/Psychic typing which also gives it the aformentioned 4x U-Turn weakness (pretty much any user of this is gonna get free momentum vs this thing) along with having to deal with a low base defense stat and sub-par speed of base 80. Being very weak to Pursuit despite not being hit super effectively by it is also a bane for Hoopa-U.  This thing would be broken as shit if it got Sucker Punch or at least Agility to mitigate its low speed, making its low base defense not really matter at all."
pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,SirHoneyDip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"OK. It still completely shits on just about any defensive build, considering most stall/semi-stall teams tend to run at most 1 Pokemon that would be able to outspeed it. And against offensive teams, if it gets a free switch in (which isn't hard to do considering its great natural bulk and although it doesn't hae any resistances, it only has 2 weaknesses, neither of which are ever run for coverage), it's more or less guaranteed to get a KO out of the deal."
pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,MuffinManWizard,2,Mon Jul 20 23:43:08 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling it'll be more popular in doubles. Hyperspace fury goes through protect which is a staple of doubles. Also, tailwind support is popular to help mitigate the 80 speed."
pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,FireSteelMerica,4,Mon Jul 20 21:07:57 2015 UTC,I didn't know that either... That is OP though.
pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,jazaniac,6,Mon Jul 20 11:22:09 2015 UTC,"Yea, 80 speed and a common x4 weakness is OP..."

pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,jazaniac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:29 2015 UTC,"It's not really fast enough for a scarf. Any priority attacks (extremespeed, bullet punch, etc) also kill it as it has poor defense which gets weaker with hyperspace fury. Scarf lando-t shuts it down completely."
pokemonshowdown,3dwrgq,El_Capitano_MC,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"I suppose. I guess I should be retracting one thing, I don't really agree with /u/muffinmanwizard's original statement, I don't believe that hoopa is OP. I do believe that it is very good. sure, it has weaknesses, but so does every pokémon, and covering for a u-turn weakness can be done very easily by slapping a rocky helmet on a ferrothorn or a bulky chomp. Also, there are plenty of pokémon with low speeds that have good scarf sets (heatran, diggersby, Chandelure, Emboar, Heracross). The scarf is meant to let it outspeed unboosted pokes. And I'm standing by my statement that it is an amazing wallbreaker, as it can run both physical and special sets."

Seriously though, if you want a good team to ladder you're gonna want some legends. You should post this over to /r/stunfisk, they will be much better help, although I don't think they will tell you anything different:  Use Baton Pass.   Don't want any legends? A well executed Baton Pass team can dominate the AG ladder.   I suggest you do something similar to this team, made by deniSsSs which dominated the OU ladder and reigned as #1 for a really long time."

I hate laddering alts in AG just because of the amount of low ladder players alerting me that I have legendaries on my team with the majority of players saying I have no skill.  However if you must not use legendaries, baton pass, klefki spam and other very clever playstyles are the way to go. Take it from a former #1 in AG, if you want to do well in this metagame you're going to have to use legendaries as the strategies listed earlier are often well prepared for by top players.  But then again, you might not care about laddering and only about having a good time. If so just use what you find appealing to you. When I started AG for the first time I used a team of six Zangooses, which didn't do too well but did make me enjoy myself.  If you want any help and are accepting of the need to use legendaries in such a hard hitting meta, PM me on Showdown and I'll be glad to help (Name: Zangooser)"

pokemonshowdown,3dlss6,xXDragonPDXx,9,Fri Jul 17 08:39:24 2015 UTC,"The first thing I see is the three fighting moves on Breloom. It's like it's trying to do too many things. If you want recovery, you might be better served with poison heal and toxic orb. if you want to set up, try switching PuP for swords dance (although 60bp Power-up punch does sound interesting, maybe try it out and see if it works).  My suggestion for Breloom would be Bullet Seed, Mach Punch, Spore and Rock Tomb, and the item being Life Orb.  Next is why do you have two mega pokémon on your team? You can only use one per battle and if you don't mega your Charizard it won't be doing a lot to help I don't think. Also the two fire moves. Swap one out for SolarBeam and swap dragon dance out for focus blast for coverage. Rock slide, ehhh I'd be tempted to change it for ancient power if i want max coverage and to abuse my insane SpA, but Roost and Dragon pulse are good moves too.  Whimsicott needs encore. Swap SolarBeam for it and change it's ability to prankster, it's a better prankster user than a chlorophyll user; the only chlorophyll user I'd want is Venusaur, although there are a few niche other. With prankster you can lock an opponent into setting up then you can force a switch or do what you please while they're sat calm-minding or whatever with a sad sorry look on their face.  Crawdaunt is a really good dragon dance user. Once he gets on or two up, with adaptability, he can tear teams apart. I'd suggest DDance, Aqua Jet (although you do have priority in mach punch, idk. Either use this or superpower for coverage), Waterfall (or crabhammer if you want extra power) and knock off.   Oh and Life Orb for Crawdaunt, quick claw seems a bit gimmicky; It'll lose you more games than it'll win."
pokemonshowdown,3dlss6,DecimalPoint,5,Fri Jul 17 09:16:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything /u/DecimalPoint has said, but maybe try a focus sash on the Breloom, so you can at least make sure you get off a spore/live something that'll sweep your entire team. Change Aggron's nature to Impish to increase it's defense, ability to sturdy, give it Thunder Wave over Rock polish as well as switch out Head Smash for something more reliable, like Earthquake. Then change the attack EV's into HP so you have a reliable wall."
pokemonshowdown,3dlss6,Lily-Olivia,3,Fri Jul 17 10:15:00 2015 UTC,Rock Polish is stupid if you're running a minus priority move like Roar. Put waterfall on Crawdaunt instead of Razor Shell.

pokemonshowdown,3dii4u,Delvez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:06 2015 UTC,He's running a Sky Plate on a Yvetal. That's a given.
pokemonshowdown,3dii4u,c6k,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:30:24 2015 UTC,Yeah I was surprised he didn't switch to a physical attacker once Chansey was out. I guess he didn't know how multiscale worked.
pokemonshowdown,3dii4u,mythrowaway1684,2,Thu Jul 16 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience OU teams go really well in AG. Because most people tend toward Uber pokes in AG, there's a much smaller pool of threats. granted they're massive threats but they can be handled by OU pokes with little trouble. Skarm walls virtually every physical threat, Chansey/Blissey almost every special threat. Heatran also does a good job there too, walling out a lot of the tier. Something else I noticed is that because the players there rely on big powerful threats, they rarely stop to think multiple plays ahead. I took an OU team consisting of mostly UU/NU pokes to 1500s in AG a while back, and I was able to do that because I was never predicted. I could freely switch in my Espeon on Darkrai, because it always went for Dark Void, which got bounced. I wasted so many lead geomancy Xerneas' because I used Mega Beedrill as a lead, and nobody there recognised the threat. Just little things like that, that an OU player recognises and adjusts to which most AG players never did."
pokemonshowdown,3dii4u,mythrowaway1684,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:28:10 2015 UTC,That may work with lower AG players but top tier players would never lose to an OU team
pokemonshowdown,3dii4u,El_Capitano_MC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"No, I don't imagine the top tier players would, but I see OU players in the 1100s and 1200s recognising and adapting to threats, whereas AG players in the 1500s weren't. There seemed to be a big difference in skill."
pokemonshowdown,3dii4u,Specktagon,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:40:14 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure. Even though AG has much more power there is still a lot of strategy required to do well

pokemonshowdown,3cx4mc,El_Capitano_MC,2,Tue Jul 14 03:55:27 2015 UTC,"It varies. Sometimes I can find them in a matter of moments, sometimes no one is there"
pokemonshowdown,3cx4mc,El_Capitano_MC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:48:34 2015 UTC,It looks like a boat load of fun. And something completely different
pokemonshowdown,3cx4mc,El_Capitano_MC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:01:44 2015 UTC,"I'm lazy and only do random battles. It's really nice to get the nostalgia going with the gen 1 battles. I also never run into an ability or item i don't recognize, which is nice"
pokemonshowdown,3cx4mc,danitykane,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:04:45 2015 UTC,Yeh I only do randoms as well. It's really so much simpler that way
pokemonshowdown,3cx4mc,-Connor-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:30:16 2015 UTC,"How is the gen I random battle? I played a few times but every time I got matched against one of a group of kids that all joined each others' games and just talked homophobia and shit the whole time, so I was kind of turned off from playing again. I just figured the community was niche enough that there probably wasn't gonna be much better."
pokemonshowdown,3cz5eq,MastaSplnter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:40:14 2015 UTC,How do people still not expect Espeon to have magic bounce?   Nice sweep also
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,DTask,19,Sat Jul 11 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Why is this sub ""look bow angry this immature teenager got"" and not interesting battles? I don't give a shit this kid got mad, I want to see some good battling."
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,c6k,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"Fuck, guys! We forgot this sub is supposed to pander to this guy's likes and wants."
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,ddrt,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:44:04 2015 UTC,I thought the battle was pretty good
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,bhjammin,3,Sat Jul 11 16:42:38 2015 UTC,I enjoyed watching the battle. Certainly glad it wasn't some super low ladder crap like what usually gets posted.
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,BandedKlefki,10,Sat Jul 11 17:06:22 2015 UTC,Low ladder really shouldn't matter. A good battle is still a good battle whether it's played in the 1100s or 1500s.
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,bhjammin,2,Sat Jul 11 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"Ya, but good battles are few and far between at the bottom of the barrel. I don't mind when people have a few bad plays, but in a lot of really low ladder stuff the players just have no idea what they're doing."
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,C17H21NO4,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, upper ladder is pretty crappy to watch. I prefer middle ladder, where the biggest difference in 2 people's teams isn't commonly which rotom-w set they're using"
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,Etern4mPh4nt0m,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:38:44 2015 UTC,That REALLY isn't how the upper ladder looks
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,C17H21NO4,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:35:48 2015 UTC,"It was obviously an exaggeration, but the higher I get on the ladder, in my experience, the more samey teams get. Sometimes they'll even be complete rip-offs of someone else's team who laddered very high up then posted their team"
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,StroHersh,4,Sun Jul 12 14:44:24 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it really grinds my gears when people say ""GG"" before the game's ended officially, even if the win is seemingly certain. It kind of just comes off as jeering, as opposed to sportsmanlike."
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,DecimalPoint,6,Sat Jul 11 17:20:53 2015 UTC,I'd normally agree with you but I said 'gg' on the last turn literally after I clicked my move to finish the game.
pokemonshowdown,3cx99b,-Crum-,6,Sat Jul 11 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"Also, looking at the replay, you said gg after it said ""00 Taskr won the battle!"" So I'm not sure where he's coming from in the first place."
pokemonshowdown,3cwuts,Kkalox,8,Sat Jul 11 13:54:40 2015 UTC,pretty sure this in direct violation of rule 1 becuase that was boring as fuck.

pokemonshowdown,3cuvxb,Mattnorden,3,Fri Jul 10 23:41:34 2015 UTC,your opponent had no way to counter you.
pokemonshowdown,3cuvxb,rog3r,2,Sat Jul 11 00:00:10 2015 UTC,"If I went for EQ on turn 1, he could've used a water attack on excadrill. Wouldn't have made a huge difference but who knows"
pokemonshowdown,3cuvxb,VanillaThunderbolt,2,Sat Jul 11 00:10:12 2015 UTC,"We also didn't see what Mon #6 was, and I'm pretty sure Barbaracle could have lived one Earthquake. That means they basically gave up Articuno and Nidoking, who actually could have done work here."

pokemonshowdown,3cqa6j,quintus_duke,3,Fri Jul 10 02:10:20 2015 UTC,"Probably scarf. Though, those sheer cold's were hitting at a higher rate than 30%, so maybe wide lens. He was outspeeding the greninja, so I'm saying most if not all had a scarf on them."
pokemonshowdown,3cqa6j,Fallout-,4,Fri Jul 10 02:39:18 2015 UTC,"All were scarfed, wide lens only adds 3% accuracy so to me the speed is more worth it"
pokemonshowdown,3cqa6j,The_BlazeMan,5,Fri Jul 10 03:03:28 2015 UTC,I don't think Wide Lens actually boosts OHKO moves.
pokemonshowdown,3cqa6j,Nikwal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"The accuracy on 1HKO moves in %  is:  Your level minus your opponent's level + 30.   If your Pokemon has a lower level, they will never hit. It's not affected by Accuracy or Evasion."
pokemonshowdown,3cq5sa,C17H21NO4,4,Thu Jul 9 21:53:42 2015 UTC,I think my favourite part about that is the fact that Caitlyn Jenner's wish kept coming true
pokemonshowdown,3cq5sa,El_Capitano_MC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:54:02 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, he had a better team than I did and probably should have won, but it was still a close battle anyhow. I do always get a chuckle when people act like it's your fault when you get hax against them, though."
pokemonshowdown,3cq5sa,danitykane,3,Thu Jul 9 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think they played particularly well, personally. They seemed really dedicated to keeping their Porygon2 alive above absolutely everything else, but it wasn't gonna do much besides paralyze everything on your team. He could have dished a lot more damage to your team once he saw stalling out with P2 wasn't a viable strategy."
pokemonshowdown,3cr2dt,Ryelvira,7,Fri Jul 10 02:22:07 2015 UTC,what?
pokemonshowdown,3cr2dt,SaiyanPrime,3,Fri Jul 10 05:39:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know which one you were, so please don't be offended, but HemStar was one of the worst players I've seen on here  recently."
pokemonshowdown,3cr2dt,eh8904,3,Fri Jul 10 12:52:11 2015 UTC,Speedy Goodra  Slow Alakazam   Even if I messed up on who's who the title does not match the game
pokemonshowdown,3cr2dt,FireSteelMerica,0,Fri Jul 10 18:15:36 2015 UTC,"I was basing the name on his team having a lot of priority, a shell smasher and naturally fast pokes when I had 4 on the slower end of the stick.   Although, admittedly, I could've used a better title."
pokemonshowdown,3cr2dt,Etern4mPh4nt0m,2,Fri Jul 10 20:29:12 2015 UTC,"That was like, 2 prioritt moves, not really a lot, while Goodra and M-Medicham aren't exactly fast."
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,raisquai,2,Thu Jul 9 05:56:00 2015 UTC,90% burn chance?
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,rog3r,3,Thu Jul 9 06:27:10 2015 UTC,"He said that because scald has a fairly high chance of burning, and it seems to almost always burn within the first 2-3 times"
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,DemonicSnail,2,Thu Jul 9 06:59:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is me. Sorry for the salt, I just hate the move Scald - seems like it always burns. Kinda funny how many people I play with turn out to be redditors, though.  Note to self: Stop forfeiting after my gimmick fails and just play it out."
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,DemonicSnail,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:59:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like a lot of people forget that you can burn and poison shedinja
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,The_BlazeMan,2,Fri Jul 10 04:40:37 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I certainly didn't forget about status. Audino was ready to Thunder Wave next turn, and if she went down, Thundurus would do it. If there's an obvious status incoming, like Toxic or Will o' Wisp, I'll switch in either Thundurus or Mandibuzz to Taunt the threat before I switch in Shedinja. That's why I hate attacking moves with a high chance to burn/poison - I can't Taunt them, I have to rely on luck."
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,DemonicSnail,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:51:40 2015 UTC,Any room for Safeguard on Audino?
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,The_BlazeMan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"Well, there's no point using Safeguard over Thunder Wave. Safeguard only lasts 5 turns whereas Paralysis lasts forever. You can't burn or poison someone through Paralysis, so t-wave just does safeguard's  job but better. The only downside is occasionally you fail to use Protect when you switch in someone to neutralize a threat, like Mold Breaker or Leech Seed. If you want to see how the whole strategy works, I wrote up a whole thing about using Shedinja in doubles and singles, too, which includes a ""hate list"" of everything that threatens Sheddy and how to deal with it."
pokemonshowdown,3cnaau,note-to-self-bot,2,Fri Jul 10 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't really get what you were saying. I thought you were going to T-Wave the other team. But now I get it."

pokemonshowdown,3c9q8s,SirHoneyDip,4,Tue Jul 7 06:23:42 2015 UTC,"This is based on the Ubers metagame. Basically, any Pokemon OU and below can ""mega evolve"" with the various mega stones in ORAS.   For example, you can give a Manaphy Sceptilite which will make its tying turn to Water/Dragon, its stats increase the same amount as Sceptilite does for Mega Sceptile and its ability becomes Lightningrod. All 6 of the Pokemon in your team can mega evolve. Even the Red and Blue Orbs for Groudon and Kyogre work for Pokemon.  There are limitations. Beedrillite is only allowed on Beedrill. Any mega stones that give the user speed boost or huge/pure power are only allowed on users that already have speed boost and huge/pure power, respectively. Ubers Pokemon are only allowed to use their native mega stones, aka Mewtwo can only use Mewtwonite X/Y. Kyurem-B, Slaking, Cresselia and Regigigas are not allowed to hold mega stones."

pokemonshowdown,3c1k9p,lu7421,14,Fri Jul 3 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"While still a highly unlikely event, it's at least more understandable given that Blissey has Serene Grace as an option."
pokemonshowdown,3c1k9p,Spazasaurus,3,Sat Jul 4 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"Lopunny - 1/2 potential freezes = (.1)(.9)   Blissey - 3/3 potential freezes = (.2)(.2)(.2)  (.1)(.9)(.2)(.2)(.2) = 0.00072, or still about a 1/1,400 chance of it going the way it did.   Edit: Embarrassing, it's 2C1 * (.1)(.9)(.2)(.2)(.2), which gives you the number /u/spazasaurus was talking about. Sorry about the mistake!"
pokemonshowdown,3c1k9p,Kwells1994,11,Sat Jul 4 03:00:50 2015 UTC,"Hm, rather than determining the chances of those exact sequence of events, I think a slightly better statistic would be to calculate the likelihood of getting 4/5 freezes (given the circumstances).  The numbers for Blissey stay the same.  0.8% chance for 3/3 freezes with Serene Grace.    As for Lopunny, it had two chances with Ice Punch to pull off a freeze.  (1 - 0.92 ) = 0.19 = 19%   Factoring both together, you get: 0.8% x 19% = 0.152%  or ~1/658  Admittedly, this is still considerably slim, but it's nonetheless more plausible than a non-Serene Grace alternative."
pokemonshowdown,3c1k9p,Spazasaurus,2,Sat Jul 4 05:57:25 2015 UTC,"Still, I'd say there's more than 1400 battles a day. So, according to the law of large numbers, hax is bound to show up sometimes."

pokemonshowdown,3c1k9p,DuckyOfChaos,5,Sat Jul 4 01:13:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if he goes first, you're likely dead anyway and wouldn't get a second turn to kill. Better to go for the kill in that situation than the Dragon Dance."
pokemonshowdown,3c1k9p,kilphil_lipey,5,Sat Jul 4 02:44:30 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is indeed 20/20. My thought process was I DD and kill with Dragon Claw the next turn, and that way I can break through Blissey. It was really skewered, especially since if I could've picked up the K/O with Zard I potentially could've roosted up on the Blissey.   I didn't think he could really hit me too much because Rock Blast/Stone Edge escaped my mind (I wasn't thinking very well, was too bothered by hax). I know I didn't play very well this match, and that was like my second or third battle with the team. Just thought it would be funny to look back at the crazy hax, haha."

pokemonshowdown,3bkxe4,Etern4mPh4nt0m,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"Um, Stored Power runs either RT or Sub, which is mainly personal preference and Heatran is the one steel Latias doesn't run RT for, lol."
pokemonshowdown,3bkxe4,StalemateVictory,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:01:37 2015 UTC,"I mostly see them in simulator running support sets, or roost over sub."
pokemonshowdown,3bkxe4,Etern4mPh4nt0m,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"You have the set all wrong actually, the normal set runs CM, Stored Power, Roost and Sub/RT"
pokemonshowdown,3bkxe4,StalemateVictory,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:43:16 2015 UTC,"Huh, no second move for more coverage? Stored power is great after 2 CM, but until then it's kind of lack luster. Plus dark types shut that down. That's why I usually see Stored Power paired with Dazzling Gleam or some other offensive move. Hence why I thought there were 2 attacking moves."

I highly recommend Global Battle Association as a restriction style tournament, it definitely helps you think outside the box.

pokemonshowdown,3bgs9u,Keplz,6,Mon Jun 29 04:15:29 2015 UTC,"He kept predicting you to use Protect with Kingdra. He fucked up by hitting Heloilisk with Encore because he thought you'd predict the encore and use protect to keep Kingdra from being stuck using focus energy. Later he expected you to protect when he had out a fairy type so he threw out sunny day instead hoping to trip you up. Basically, he was way overthinking things."

pokemonshowdown,3b8qd2,milkman1233,6,Fri Jun 26 21:51:14 2015 UTC,That reflect type play is pretty nasty. Is that a common Latias set? Is there good counter?
pokemonshowdown,3b8qd2,kekkyman,5,Sat Jun 27 02:35:23 2015 UTC,It's a nice option over Substitute to troll Ferrothorn/Scizor/Pursuit trappers and such. Every single Dark type counters this set because it runs only Psyshock or Stored Power as an attacking move.

pokemonshowdown,3b0s1y,brownboss,4,Thu Jun 25 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"Well, if you destroy someone like that saying, ""gg"", at the end is a pretty big, ""fuck you!"", to the guy you beat.        It's good sportsmanship on their part if they say, ""gg"", after getting stomped but coming from the one doing the stomping it's not so much.        As someone who is salty at times too often...just sayin'."
pokemonshowdown,3b0s1y,Magicbison,4,Thu Jun 25 02:37:12 2015 UTC,"Saying gg in the end is good sportsmanship coming from both sides, doesn't matter if you win or lose. Saying wp on the other hand from the winning side is basically mocking your opponent."
pokemonshowdown,3b0s1y,Etern4mPh4nt0m,5,Thu Jun 25 06:00:07 2015 UTC,"No, if you stomp your opponent into the ground and then say gg it just sounds like an insult. If you 6-0 someone and say gg then you are being a bad sport."
pokemonshowdown,3b0s1y,Magicbison,3,Thu Jun 25 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"The term ""gg"" shows that you're giving your opponent credit and respecting him, no matter the outcome. Not to mention, this wasn't even close to a 6-0."
pokemonshowdown,3b0s1y,Etern4mPh4nt0m,0,Thu Jun 25 15:56:43 2015 UTC,You are missing the point entirely.         If you stomp someone into the dirt be a good sport and stay quiet. If they say gg then respond if not don't.         If you want to be a good sport and be respectful then learn when it's appropriate to give a gg.        If you say gg to a guy and he tells you to fuck off then you should know you came off as a jerk.       Simple.
pokemonshowdown,3b0s1y,Magicbison,4,Thu Jun 25 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"First off-was that a stomp? No.  Second of all, if you play a football match and you win with a very one-sided 7-0, will you not give the other team a handshake? This is basically the same thing, since ""gg"" is not used to say ""you played well, good game"" or ""you sucked, I win"", it's used to show respect. If showing respect is so dirty and makes you an asshole, I guess that's it for society."

However; Umbreon with Curse, Sub, Payback and Moonlight with max HP and SpD is so fucking good. People that don't expect the set up and expect a Toxic can easily get swept by it. Espeon is the best bouncer (maybe excluding M-Sableye) because she can also hit like a truck. Vaporeon is also fun with a stall set; Toxic, Wish, Protect, Scald."

Vaporeon as the Scald Toxic guy. Umbreon as the Heal Bell Toxic guy. I had Jolteon instead of Glaceon, as I feel it's more useful as a quick sp. attacker, but up to you. Espeon I had screens + light clay, quite handy for a set up, too. Leafeon swords dance, knock off, leaf blade etc. And Flareon I had a fun set of: Facade, Rest, Sleep Talk, Flare Blitz/Flame Charge (Toxic Orb + Guts).  Give the attackers speed + sp. att/att EVs, and the more defensive ones HP and def/sp.def.  Sp. Def Umbreon, Def Vaporeon. I also gave Espeon and Flareon full HP EVs, but up to you.

pokemonshowdown,3au5i3,Gullibler,6,Tue Jun 23 16:34:02 2015 UTC,"Also with that ""strategy"" you have to somehow ensure that your guy outspeeds the other because linking a priority move with a non-priority move negates priority"
pokemonshowdown,3au5i3,brownboss,5,Tue Jun 23 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"Mons with Fake Out+U-Turn are better off scarfed anyway, since they need to outspeed the opposing Pokemon and Linked uses the priority of the lower priority move."

pokemonshowdown,3au5i3,saprwin,-11,Wed Jun 24 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"The opponents strategy was Fake-Out, U-Turn, Fake-Out, U-Turn. Both pokemon were holding King's Rock to increase chance of flinch which is why U-Turn was causing flinches. He needed both pokemon alive to keep his strategy going, but Persian died to Rocky Helmet so he only had one Fake-Out pokemon with both U-Turn as probably their only attack. So no way the opponent could've won without pivot momentum."
pokemonshowdown,3au5i3,metoxys,20,Tue Jun 23 16:36:12 2015 UTC,Both pokemon were holding King's Rock to increase chance of flinch which is why U-Turn was causing flinches.   Both pokemon were holding Life Orb.

Like I didn't notice they had life orb because I assumed King's Rock was what caused all that flinching. I feel stupid for not noticing the Life Orb damage though."
pokemonshowdown,3au5i3,VanillaThunderbolt,3,Wed Jun 24 06:13:28 2015 UTC,"This was a new thing to me about a week ago, so maybe I can explain.  This is a linked battle, where the moves in slot 1 and 2 are done in tandem (move 1, then 2) in one turn. Moves 3 and 4 can be used independently, but each will take up a turn as they would in a normal battle.  This guy was using Fake Out and U-Turn in slots 1 and 2 respectively, so Persian and Mienshao would Fake Out, then U-Turn in one move. This would allow them to Flinch the opponent, then switch out.  Other common strategies I saw in this format were Light Clay + Reflect + Light Screen (dual screens in one move) and Smack Down + Earthquake."
pokemonshowdown,3au5i3,JonasCliver,6,Wed Jun 24 14:20:30 2015 UTC,U-Turn wasn't causing fliches. Fake Out was. Both lost HP to Life Orb with every attack.

pokemonshowdown,3agwsb,tezzeret1,3,Sat Jun 20 17:44:30 2015 UTC,I suppose it was a 4-1 forfeit. Although his aurorus was already dead if you count the rock damage.

pokemonshowdown,3ag48h,DemonicSnail,13,Fri Jun 19 23:56:21 2015 UTC,I'm scratching my head wondering what else that Rotom might have had that couldn't have been useful. Was it a Volt Switch / Scald / Hydro Pump / Rest or something?   Will-o-Wisp would have won the game.

I'm sure there are other good item options, I was only curious as to why he chose a Quick Claw over everything else."
pokemonshowdown,3agdjk,DemonicSnail,3,Sat Jun 20 00:34:38 2015 UTC,Dont want to get locked into one move. And people try to outplay the scarf to not get hit with a super effective move. So i hit them with one of the other moves available to me.
pokemonshowdown,3agdjk,DemonicSnail,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:41:39 2015 UTC,Just curious as to why Quick Claw is your item. I feel like excluding scarf you might have better options.

You could have easily pulled off a Tyranitar sweep about halfway through the game. For future reference, Mega Tyranitar is basically the perfect counter to Zard Y. You can switch in on basically anything it can throw at you thanks to sand stream and the SpDef boost it gives you, Dragon Dance until it switches out then wreck everything."

pokemonshowdown,396b0w,Kwells1994,10,Tue Jun 9 16:00:20 2015 UTC,I swear people will look for anything to whine about. This guy in particular complaining about my sets.
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,Kwells1994,16,Tue Jun 9 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"I mean, AV Magnezone is a bit unorthodox, but it's not at all unviable. With its good defense it gives it special bulk and that's really valuable.   And max defense Ttar is a standard set, isn't it? It complements its special defense from sand pretty well. Definitely unwarranted whines."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,Housesize,10,Tue Jun 9 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"The Tyranitar set is indeed a standard set on smogon. Here's the set:  Tyranitar (M) @ Leftovers  Ability: Sand Stream  EVs: 248 HP / 80 Def / 180 SpD  Relaxed Nature   Stealth Rock Stone Edge Pursuit Ice Beam   I wanted to use defensive T-Tar and it's been rather effective so far. The AV Magnezone was just something I wanted to try as it gives Zone good special bulk and I can bluff choice sets, as shown in the replay."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,C17H21NO4,4,Tue Jun 9 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"max def set ttar isn't as viable as others, mainly because it can still be toxiced/burned and doesnt really have recovery. people see ttar and think big/bulky hitter, so it does give def ttar the element of suprise tho."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,Housesize,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"AV Magnezone is not that viable--I hate to say it, but there are better ones. I don't have access to it, but this was brought up in a Smogon ""Don't Use That, Use This"" Thread. AV Serp/Magnezone/Victini/one other thing i forget are just outclassed as AV users. The thing is that the thread is specifically about things that are outclassed, not things with niches. Go scarf or Specs. I'm not saying AV Zone can't put in work, but there are better things you can be doing with zone/better sets for AV users. Mag is used for trapping slower steels, not to take special hits. You have AV Torn-T for that kind of stuff."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,C17H21NO4,6,Wed Jun 10 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"Just because something is outclassed doesn't mean it's not viable, and sometimes the element of surprise you get using a team that isn't just some rehash of the other cookie cutter teams on PS can bridge that gap.   It gets a lot of hate, too. People ought to realize that you aren't a noob for using something other than smogon copy pastes."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,Housesize,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:35:44 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with the idea that something completely outclassed can still put in work, e.g. Darmanitan can still do stuff in OU even though Victini outclasses it. The thing is, Victini outclassing Darmanitan implies that there is no reason to ever use Darmanitan in OU.   ""Surprise"" is almost always used as a catch-all phrase by less experienced players to justify their choices when there really is none. The thing is, if you're using something only for its surprise value, it's worthless. If you want to play competitively, you use surprise sets because they do something that nothing else can do better. If you want to play competitively, you do not use something unusual just to be a hipster."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,Cephalophobe,6,Wed Jun 10 23:08:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not proposing that people use under-tiered teams in OU and up, even though that can be a valid strategy (not using a completely NU team in OU, but running a mon from a lower tier which OU teams aren't prepared for).  I'm saying that using sets that aren't listen on smogon, that you've come up with yourself in many cases, can really tear apart teams because their team is set up to respond to particular threats, not what you're throwing at them.   And I'm also not saying that the surprise value of doing something unexpected alone is worth more than pokemon that may out class it. I'm saying that the surprise value in addition to the value it holds for your team can sometimes make it worth more than something that, on paper, outclasses it.   Competitive or not, it's still a game. You should do what you have fun doing, not copy and paste someone else's team because it's completely broken."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,reekhadol,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:04:11 2015 UTC,"agree completely with that last part--if using unusual stuff is your thing, do it."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,King-Slime,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:06:23 2015 UTC,"I think there are two types of surprise we're talking about here. There's teambuilding surprise, and there's playstyle surprise.  Teambuilding surprise is when you run a weird set that is sufficiently esoteric that people don't build defenses for it. I think this is perfectly viable, although you have to be aware of the ways the meta shifts.  Playstyle surprise is when you use an esoteric set and your opponent doesn't do well against it because it's something completely unexpected. I think this isn't a great idea, because on the higher-level ladder, your opponents are going to have seen your battles and know what sets you're running."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,JonasCliver,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:41:29 2015 UTC,"The team he was using is very fragile and requires careful play, the only thing he could have done for a positive outcome was go into chomp and set up rocks.

pokemonshowdown,396b0w,kkjdroid,3,Wed Jun 10 14:02:22 2015 UTC,True but I think Garchomp or Dragalge would have been way better switch ins then Sharpedo.
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,JustyUekiTylor,5,Wed Jun 10 15:52:58 2015 UTC,"I got the same reaction for running BW BoltBeam Latios in ORAS OU. It was fantastic, dude had a Gyarados and a Gliscor iirc and expected to take a Draco Meteor and have Gliscor tank everything. And of course I was the noob for winning."
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,brownboss,3,Wed Jun 10 15:47:53 2015 UTC,His first mistake was trying to have a Gliscor tank a hit from a Latios.
pokemonshowdown,396b0w,360Saturn,5,Wed Jun 10 15:51:51 2015 UTC,A -2 Latios with a standard XY set can't kill a Roosting Gliscor. They usually run DM/Psyshock/HP Fire/Defog and DM isn't guaranteed the one-shot even at -0 with orb.

pokemonshowdown,388aws,MyGrandpaLikesGuns,3,Tue Jun 2 21:56:47 2015 UTC,"I e been wondering the same thing. I ended up downloading the game itself and it runs just fine. As for the .com, I haven't been able to access it for al out a week now."
pokemonshowdown,388aws,MyGrandpaLikesGuns,2,Tue Jun 2 16:16:54 2015 UTC,"This worked, forgot about client. Ty."

pokemonshowdown,385vp2,C17H21NO4,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:08:38 2015 UTC,Aerolite + quick attack just destroys teams
pokemonshowdown,384vun,danitykane,2,Mon Jun 1 21:41:58 2015 UTC,Freeze proc and 15 consecutive turns of not thawing = .1 * .815 = 0.352%
pokemonshowdown,384vun,BobRoss1776,3,Tue Jun 2 00:34:07 2015 UTC,It's actually around 0.004 with 6 or 7 more decimals.
pokemonshowdown,384vun,Etern4mPh4nt0m,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:32:41 2015 UTC,Are you sure? I double checked my math
pokemonshowdown,384vun,BobRoss1776,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:57:47 2015 UTC,May have done sth wrong but that is 0.003 not 0.3% :P
pokemonshowdown,384vun,Etern4mPh4nt0m,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:43:04 2015 UTC,0.003 is 0.3%
pokemonshowdown,384vun,BobRoss1776,2,Wed Jun 3 11:41:31 2015 UTC,"Right, was barely awake at the time, my bad."
pokemonshowdown,384vun,Etern4mPh4nt0m,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:05:57 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it only be 14 turns? Or can you unthaw on the same turn that you get frozen?
pokemonshowdown,384vun,bhjammin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:29:51 2015 UTC,You can do that on the first turn. Every time you try to use a move while frozen you have a 20% to thaw
pokemonshowdown,384vun,BobRoss1776,2,Tue Jun 2 11:29:53 2015 UTC,Oh cool. Thanks for letting me know.
pokemonshowdown,384vun,bhjammin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"also that team, this game wasn't for him."
pokemonshowdown,384vun,rog3r,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:34:08 2015 UTC,Being frozen for that long is straight up BS. 10+ turns of not being able to do anything is unfair.
pokemonshowdown,385lq1,brownboss,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:42:16 2015 UTC,That Espeon move is pretty sick
pokemonshowdown,385lq1,FireSteelMerica,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:27:29 2015 UTC,this tier is absolute garbage
pokemonshowdown,385lq1,chopsticktoddler,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:55:51 2015 UTC,"It's just a monthly meta, dude. They're just for fun/experimentation"
pokemonshowdown,385lq1,chopsticktoddler,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:00:05 2015 UTC,"fair. but jeez... just a bit broken, don't you think?"
pokemonshowdown,383p1x,TricksterDude63,3,Mon Jun 1 17:03:51 2015 UTC,Yeah man fuck you. How dare you play to win the game!
pokemonshowdown,383p1x,brownboss,-5,Mon Jun 1 23:07:14 2015 UTC,"Saying ""gg"" after destroying your opponent makes you sound like a douchebag."
pokemonshowdown,383p1x,Magicbison,5,Tue Jun 2 00:45:41 2015 UTC,"if you think that, then you can't take a loss properly"
pokemonshowdown,383p1x,brownboss,2,Tue Jun 2 00:59:50 2015 UTC,Wasn't even that close

pokemonshowdown,381nky,rog3r,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"With skill link/king's rock/any multi-hitting move, you get a chance between 40-50% of critting, so it's pretty likely. It's why the biggest hard counter to Cinccino is priority. It can't take hits at all, haha."
pokemonshowdown,37z3zt,Cr4nkine,1 point,Sun May 31 17:01:28 2015 UTC,Why did smeargle have wonder guard?
pokemonshowdown,37z3zt,thenordicbat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"In Challenge cup, all the pokemon on the team are randomised, along with their moves and abilities. That guy was lucky enough to get a water move on a water pokemon."
pokemonshowdown,37z3zt,FlaccidFlamingo,0,Mon Jun 1 17:56:19 2015 UTC,Was it always like that? I swear they only used learnable moves and abilities before.
pokemonshowdown,37z3zt,FlaccidFlamingo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:26:41 2015 UTC,"Abilities and moves are randomised. In a game I just played, my joltik got taken down by a precipice blades bunnelby."

pokemonshowdown,37wttj,thirty-eight,4,Sun May 31 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"It was more like: ""I'm going to lose this battle, better find something to blame."" The crit on cresselia didn't matter at all, Chandelure over doubles it's speed."
pokemonshowdown,37wttj,Cr4nkine,2,Sun May 31 18:50:38 2015 UTC,The Snorlax getting confused certainly mattered
pokemonshowdown,37wttj,DarthNader_,2,Sun May 31 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"But at the same time, that was bound to happen because of the 25% chance within the three to four turns. Don't forget about the crit and para haxed that occured against Machamp. That made it a lot more difficult to stop Snorlax."
pokemonshowdown,37wttj,chopsticktoddler,2,Sun May 31 19:18:03 2015 UTC,It's part of the game
