RomeSweetRome,3604yw,smacbeats,11,Fri May 15 02:38:27 2015 UTC,"Day 2 - Morning      Lance Corporal Stephen Zeigler woke at 0500. It took him 30 seconds to remember where he was and what had happened the previous day. It was dark before Colonel Nelson had stopped bellowing orders at them, and then all he could do was bed down for the night. All he knew was that he was supposed to be in Kandahar by now. But he sure as Hell never left Kabul. Colonel Nelson was at it again, shouting for four of the Sea Knight crews to take to the air ‘yesterday’.  “Zeigler! This means you!” Sergeant Thompson screamed as he stuck his tiny bald head through the tent flap.  “Yes Sarg!” Zeigler retorted. More enthusiastic about taking to the skies than he hand been for the whole of his 4th Tour.      Ziegler had done this before. Too many times. He had over 600 hours of flight time as a crew chief. The Sea Knight lifted comfortably into the air above the makeshift camp as Ziegler took stock of their surroundings. In front of them was a large river, winding through what appeared to be underdeveloped countryside. Spacious settlements could be seen dotting the rolling hills around them; sleepy villages were mixed with country estates. Some sort of villa within its own fortified compound lay less than two miles beyond the boundaries of the camp. Ziegler wondered if the sentries had already reported this to the Colonel. But he didn’t really care. He signalled the crew to follow the course of the river, as per Nelsons orders. The three other Sea Knights fall in tight formation behind him as they cruise along the banks of the river toward a tower of smoke on the horizon.  As they pass over vineyards and orchards, one thing is for certain. This is neither Kabul nor Kandahar.     ...    Tiberius’s skull was about to split in two. He didn’t know whether he had spent the whole night in the brothel or the arena. He looked around him at the piles of dirt and human shit and for a moment thought his time was finally up. Solonious must have reported him to the authorities in Rome – claiming his property in the process. Augustus preached mercy but his cronies were always looking for land to settle their own.      “Someone get him cleaned up for Jupiter’s sake!” an unknown figure bellowed down the steps to the small holding cells. “You were supposed to hold him securely, not imprison him! One of you will be flogged for this you mark my words!” A small figure emerged form the shadows. Around 40 years old, black hair peppered with grey at his temples, and the hint of a growing gut beneath a perfectly white toga. Murena! It had to be. The thick purple band decorating his toga betrayed his position… as did his pronounced nose. Tiberius felt joy turn to ash in his mouth as he remembered the purpose of his visit.  “Dominus...”, he managed “I have grave news from your lands aside the Tiber. I must speak with you”. “Yes, yes, yes. We have plenty time for that. Now tell me, what is your name Sir?” Senator Murena asked as he motioned for the guard to release Tiberius from the holding cell.  “My name, Dominus?” Tiberius asked, now unsure of himself. Nobody this far advanced of his station had ever cared to ask his name. A cloud of dread passed over Tiberius – there was no reason for a Senator to extend him courtesy – save in attempt to bend him to his will. The snake pit of politics and power was a place Tiberius had no desire to be."

RomeSweetRome,3604yw,therealknewman,1 point,Fri May 15 13:22:08 2015 UTC,"Day 2 – Afternoon     The beasts roared as they crossed first the Aurelian walls then Servian walls with impunity. The greatest city in the world stopped and descended into chaos at the sound of their arrival. Woman screamed at the sky and prayed for their children. The ruling classes coward in their Villas on the Caelian Hill or darted toward the sacred temples of their ancestors. Before long, heretics from every religion imaginable filled the streets with their shrill warnings and cries of penance.      Caesar Divi Filius Augustus, Imperator of Rome stopped mid address. Screams carried up the steps of the Senate House as Praetorians moved to block the entrance. Several Senators shot nervous glances toward the mob, now clearly visible ascending the Capitoline.      Senator Aulus glanced at the tight gaggle of Republicans two rows in front of him. Their eyes betrayed their fear, and he knew he had them. He had been awake all night as peasants streamed into his villa seeking protection. At first he hadn’t believed their stories. Daemons were not something he concerned himself with, he knew that the men he sat amongst every day were far more dangerous than anything Hades could produce. But details had started which made it clear there was a strange army on his land, bringing with then an array of siege materials unlike anything he had ever heard of. Strange armoured carts, which seemed to travel under their own power, and even some talk of flying machines! These stories were confirmed by Tiberius that morning. Tiberius. The mans family had served his own for longer than any of them could remember. Always a loyal bunch. Stupid, perhaps. But loyal.      As far as the Senator knew, Tiberius was the only man to meet any of the strange invading army. Something in the way he described their confusion filled the Senator with hope. No invading army could possibly be so ill prepared for the local conditions. They must have come from the east; Aulus had heard strange stories of magic from beyond the furthest reaches of the Empire. Perhaps the invaders had been caught in a storm and washed up on the banks of the Tiber. Immediately Aulus had begun formulating a plan to turn the unexpected news to his advantage. At the very worst the invaders would confuse Augustus for long enough for the Republican co-conspirators to take back control of the Senate. And at best he could use their siege machines to seize power for himself. He had sent trusted messengers to inform the others before news hit Rome herself. When he returned from the Senate he would send Tiberius to treat with invaders, if he was caught by Augustus’s spies it would be no great loss to the world.            Ziegler instructed his crew to take the Sea Knight lower and lower. Until he saw the mobs of screaming people below him he refused to believe where he was. He had no way of explaining what his senses were reporting. The undeniable truth was that they no longer occupied the same space or time as they had the day before.           On the ground below, Centurion Rufus Aurelius Atticus shoved his way through the growing crowd and out into the street. He had spent the morning sampling wine in the markets of the Subura. First Centurion Marcus Cato had given him the task of purchasing 50 barrels for the officers to enjoy on the Feast of Ludi Piscatorii. The man claimed he didn’t trust slaves to pick a decent vintage, but Rufus suspected it had more to do with Marcus’s distrust of anyone threatening his power base. Marcus has become First Centurion of the Praetorian Guard, the highest honour available to a man born of his class, two years previously. He had demonstrated loyalty in Augustus’s civil wars but lately had turned to corruption and wouldn’t risk Rufus’s presence when any of his more suspect encounters were due to take place.      Rufus shielded his eyes from the sun as he stared toward the sky. At first he didn’t know what the fuss was about, but as the wine induced haze began to clear he recognised the source of the panic that seemed to have gripped the streets. Huge metal beasts screamed through the sky above his beloved city, diving close to the grand buildings of the Forum before rising back up to dizzying heights. Immediately Rufus recognized the threat posed by these strange creatures, he burst into a run through the streets of Rome, heading towards the Capitoline. The Praetorian barracks were too far and Rufus knew that any orders would come from the Senate directly.      Rufus arrived at the steps of the Senate house as Imperator Augustus stepped out into the light. The noise tripled in intensity as the mob immediately started screaming at Augustus to save them. Rufus swelled with pride as the Praetorians locked shields and held the mob back; all the while their faces betrayed no emotion. These truly were the best-trained soldiers in the world and Rufus knew that with 4,000 of them at his back he could face any foe.      Augustus looked out over a city in panic. Will grim determination he signalled for his horse and moved out into the streets. His Praetorians filled in around him, more appearing from the crowd all the time. He was resolved not to address the mob until he knew what he was facing. He hadn’t emerged as ruler of the greatest empire the world had ever known by making rash decisions. The growing body of horsemen filled out of the Forum and followed the strange creatures toward the city limits.   As the scale of the panic struck Augustus he motioned to the nearest officer. A centurion of the Praetorian Guard trotted forward unsteadily on his horse, clearly a little intoxicated. “Mobilise your men Centurion,” Augustus barked “I don’t want to be greeted by a rebellion when I return!” “Yes, Imperator”, Centurion Rufus replied, praying that he wouldn’t slur his words.  “And have every other available man mobilised and ready to garrison the walls.” Augustus added.  “Imperator,” Rufus turned his horse slowly so as not to disgrace himself and set of toward the Praetorian barracks.           Augustus returned to the senate after watching the machines leaving his city from the Porta Latina. The streets were noticeably quieter now. He made a mental note to find the centurion he had given his orders to. The man was clearly drunk, but he had done a fine job all the same.   Augustus noted that most of the other Senators had remained within the relative safety of the Senate House during his journey. This only served to strengthen his resolve to replace many of their number with his own Generals, once this latest crisis had been dealt with. ""My fellow Romans,"" he said simply, ""those were machines, not creatures. I've seen enough campaigns to know the difference."" Grizzled military veterans in his audience are smart enough not to dwell long on the difference between their field experience and his. ""It appears, gentlemen of the Senate, that we have a war on our hands."""

RomeSweetRome,3604yw,Jatexi,4,Fri May 15 04:22:09 2015 UTC,Awesome! Can't wait for Day 3 (and beyond).
RomeSweetRome,30xdnz,Prufrock451,41,Tue Mar 31 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"DAY TWO  Josh wakes up in a fetid swamp. His clothes are torn and fouled. He's lost a boot. He's covered in mosquito bites and he discovers three leeches on his legs and one on his back.   Two helicopters roar overhead. Josh stares dumbly at them through the trees as they recede. Finally, shouting, he staggers after them. His shirt snags on a vine. Desperately, Josh pulls at it until it rips. He ties it around his waist. Waving his hands, he slogs through the swamp after the helicopters.   He emerges from the copse of trees into tall reeds. He can hear distant voices, but the creaking, chattering reeds and the sounds of birds and insects drown out the noise. His head is pounding. He's desperately thirsty, but he doesn't dare drink the muddy water around him.   A swamp anywhere close to Bagram, he figures, is going to be swimming with filth. He's swimming through a decade of unfiltered MREs. The images get maybe three seconds to run through his head before he's puking. He rips another leech off his leg and starts crying as the blood pours out, as he realizes his open wounds are getting all this shit and swamp water sloshed into them. I'm going to need my own weight in antibiotics tonight, Josh thinks.  The sandstorm must have knocked him downhill. He's racking his brain trying to think of where the hell is downhill and full of swamp inside the perimeter. He spots a hill and climbs it.   It's just swampland as far as he can see. It's hazy and humid.   ""This is ridiculous,"" thinks Josh. ""This is not right.""   He turns around and through the haze, he sees a shimmering mirage - a flat disc, hundreds of meters across, surrounded by a ragged ring of bent and crumpled concrete. He sees tents and shelters being erected, and wrecked helicopters, and the distant shapes of Marines at work. Beyond them, he sees no mountains, no dusty plains, no Bagram Air Base. He is somewhere else. He is somewhere new.   He has only a moment to register this before he hears a twig snap. He turns around and sees a stick whistling down at his head. With a flare of light, he's struck down and in a red roaring haze he passes out, stunned."
RomeSweetRome,30xdnz,SWEET_JESUS_NIPPLES,23,Tue Mar 31 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"DAY THREE  Josh is staring at a ceiling of woven sticks. Sunlight is twinkling in, and it makes Josh wince. His head feels taut and pain is pulsing through his scalp. He's wearing some kind of bandage.   Josh sits up but that makes everything hurt. He falls back, groaning. It's some kind of straw mat.   Adrenaline shoots through him. I'm in a hut. I got hit in the head. The Taliban got me. I'm going to get beheaded on LiveLeak.   Josh's head is swimming and he leans over and pukes. A clay jug appears in front of him, cool water in it. He drinks. The water tastes almost salty, and there's a teaspoon of silt at the bottom of it. It's the best water he's ever had.   His heart seizes up again. He looks over. It's a girl, hair in twisted curls. Dark black eyes. She reaches out and takes the jug and leaves without a word.   Josh checks his pockets. His Leatherman is gone, and so's his iPhone.   ""Taliban goatf-""  He's not in Afghanistan, is he? That hill. Josh shakes his head. Nothing makes sense. What was he saw yesterday? He has a concussion.   The girl comes back with another jug of water. Josh drinks it greedily. She looks at him curiously.   ""Salaam,"" he tries out. She blinks at him curiously. ""Salaam,"" he repeats. She grins and grabs the jug. She brings it back with more water. He drinks, but it's basically brine and he spits it out reflexively. She looks disappointed and confused.   ""Sorry,"" Josh mumbles. ""Sorry. Maybe I should just go back to sleep for a while. Can I sleep with a concussion?""   ""Concussion?"" The girl claps softly. Josh gives her a thumbs up and passes out."

I really like the tactics and military conflict aspect of the story, but I had an idea from reading this that it would be cool to explore the science fiction aspect of how / why the time travel occurred. Of course there's the trope of some secret U.S. government experiment gone wrong, but I think a fun twist would be if it was something the conspiratorial senator did... like an alchemy style secret ritual experiment he was paying some priests to do - they were stacking blocks of special strange stone (raw uranium) accidentally forming a runaway nuclear reaction just as a neutrino passed by and blah blah quantum wormhole blah leads to the transport of the Marines. So then when everyone discovers it was these Roman priests who did it, it can kind of be up in the air whether it was pure science or the gods really were involved."

RomeSweetRome,2vgg2t,Squirmin,8,Wed Feb 11 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"An aircraft carrier in WW1, while it might be useful, would not drastically impact the war (Unless you mean it joined the German side, in which case could cause the fall of Great Britain)   The German navy in WW1 was modern and powerful, but the British navy was far superior in number. The Germans attempted to curb British trade through the use of U-boats in the Atlantic and north sea, but the Germans, fearing the wrath of the Americans, ended this practice, and moved their ships to the Mediterranean. The British, French and Italians had nearly complete control of the seas from Gibraltar to Gallipoli. The Ottomans was the sick man of Europe, and while their troops were brave, they lacked proper weapons, supply and leadership. Besides, their navy was awful.   TL;DR: Essentially, WW1 was a land war with some less significant naval battles.   A french carrier (the Charles De Gaulle?) Could have ended the British, allowing Napoleon to conquer England, and truly establish his hegemony over Europe and their colonies."
RomeSweetRome,2vgg2t,RaceHard,5,Wed Feb 11 07:06:46 2015 UTC,"Are you serious?  Think of the tech inside an air carrier, nuclear power, radar, missile tech that is literally way, way ahead the wildest dreams of the time. Anti submarine depth charges, computers, supersonic jets, etc. You know whichever side it allies with would have a jump in the tech tree so drastic that it would signal the end of all other countries. It would mean a hegemony being established.  They are small cities at sea, but imagine this baby: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gerald_R._Ford_%28CVN-78%29  Drones, lasers, and possibly a magnetic gun, she is death at sea.   Even in WWI's land battle, she is so powerful that her airforce would wreck any target."
RomeSweetRome,2vgg2t,Wake_Island,4,Wed Feb 11 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"I hesitate to say they would leap up the tech tree. They would still need to be able to replicate the tech, which they wouldn't be able to do. Micro circuitry requires finer instruments than they had in hand back then. If the people in the ship had blueprints for the machines that built the ship and everything that went in it, then it would be easier to advance."
RomeSweetRome,2vgg2t,RaceHard,4,Wed Feb 11 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"Well an air carrier has some very capable engineers, and more than a few people with doctorate level degrees, not to mention an extensive technical library just in case they must do repairs at sea in null security conditions. That meaning they being alone. While they could not make a computer easily, they could certainly start the process much easily that anyone with no technological nor technical knowledge.   Their technical library does have a fairly detailed amount of schematics for the ship, and some blueprints to help locate and repair problems. Its reactors can power it up for about 25 years before needing refueling."

RomeSweetRome,2vgg2t,oatmealsnap,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"well, considering how the Ford still doesn't work, I don't think it would be as big of an advantage as you think.  Also, the ship would be out of supplies in a week.  The amount of at-sea replenishments necessary would lead to the ship being abandoned within a relatively short amount of time.  Source?  I actually am attached to a nimitz-class aircraft carrier.  But it would be fun reading about how the people might circumvent those logistical problems.  And what if some Russians or ISIL soldiers made it through, too?"

Also, the generals were of the higher classes."
RomeSweetRome,2v25mc,speccy2,8,Sat Feb 7 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"VUlgar Latin in the days of the late Republic and Early Empire was very close to the Ciceronian Latin we know and love.  It was the same exact language.  This single tongue would likely to have been spoken by everyone they're likely to encounter.  It's the middle of Italy near Rome.  Not the fringes of the empire.  I may be exaggerating a little here, but what you're saying is about as comparable as if 2000 years from now writes a story about their people timetraveling back to ""Ancient America"" and someone asks if they're actually going to be speaking English in this movie, and the future version of you says that actually most people there actually spoke French (the elites) and the regular everyday folks spoke Ebonics or Spanish.  Yeah, to an extent, all that is true.  But what is also true is that Ebonics, at this point, isn't far from regular English at all, and that virtually everyone can speak English.  Your entire argument is just very misinformed.   The Roman people most commonly spoke Greek or Vulgar Latin.   The Roman people, in Italy, at that period of time, spoke LATIN, and could converse easily to the elites, because vulgar latin is just one dialect of the same language they shared.    You are way overcomepnsa"
RomeSweetRome,2v25mc,SeVenthRequiem,-7,Mon Feb 9 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"Perhaps my wording was not the best because the Romans did not come up with the word Barbarus. They Latinized it from Greek. It certainly does mean one who speaks a language other than greek. The fact that you deny this, shows that you're not actually a classicist.

RomeSweetRome,2v25mc,septicsmile,0,Sat Feb 7 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"You either don't know what ""literal"" means or you don't really understand βάρβαρος. By literal, I assume you meant that the word contained the implicit definition of ""not speaking Greek"". In fact, βάρβαρος is merely a reduplicated onomatopoeic imitation of foreign speech. It literally means, if by literal we mean comes from etymologically, ""babbler"", and we can compare it to Sanskrit barbara-' ""stammer"", if Beekes 2010 (Etymological Dictionary of Greek) is to be believed (you can check it in Pokorny as well, #95).   Using literal is not the right word, sure. That doesn't mean what I said was wrong. In fact your entire post below confirms everything I had said.    What you mean is not a literal definition, but rather one of the many connotations of βάρβαρος. More importantly, it does not, even by your own quoted definitions, mean someone who doesn't speak Greek, but rather, a non-Greek ethnically, where the ethnic indicium is language, rather than religion, customs, or blood descent (for more on this, see J. Hall, ""Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity, 1997). If you'd rather see something free online, you can check out my Master's thesis, ""Building Barbarian Belief"" (2011), in which the second chapter goes over much of this in relationship to the Greek conception of the Scythians. I focus on religion, but I cover the scholarship just fine.   My first quoted definition says ""One who speaks another (non-greek) language. What does that mean to you? It means to me somebody who doesn't speak greek. Of course it would relate to culture as well but somebody who was Roman and spoke greek would not have been considered a Barbaros by other Romans.   To cover your other points, Classical Latin (by which we obviously mean the literary Latin of Cicero, Caesar, etc.) is perfectly intelligible with the common, spoken Latin. It's no different than the situation today where people can say one thing, like ""me and my friend went to the store"", but perfectly understand a sentence in the book like ""My friend and I went to the store"". One is vulgar, the other proper or literary even.   Vulgar latin versus Classical latin is not that simple. Sure what you're saying is improper and holds to the vulgar definition but the better comparison would be what is crudely called Ebonics and Standard English.  For somebody immersed in the area and used to hearing it sure they could translate it, but a person who studied classical latin explicitly and did not hear vulgar latin? No they wouldn't be able to understand it.    Finally, the Romans borrowed barbaros as barbarus, but it was applied even to Latin for centuries, but this was in opposition to Greek on a literary level. You don't see graffiti on the walls of Pompeii talking about barbarians. That educated Romans would be able to speak both Latin and Greek is clear, but what's less clear is how much Greek illiterate people would have known. Key to this, I believe, can be found in Cicero's writings. If you read his private letters to Atticus, Greek words abound untranslated. But if you read his philosophical works, uncommon Greek words are often explained. These would be for the common citizens, those who cannot read Greek. Finally, Greek is largely absent from his orations. Who do you think would be listening to his speeches? So most people in ancient Rome knew Latin, not Greek. If you have doubt about this, just read J. N. Adams' Bilingualism and the Latin Language (2008).   I said this in my reply that saying the Romans came up with it was incorrect. I corrected it and said that the Romans took it from the Greek word. So this whole paragraph was kind of a waste.   As far as the bit about Cicero. He would have of course written the speeches in Latin because it wasn't a casual conversation. It was a speech and official/political thing. I never said Romans didn't know Latin I said they didn't speak it often. At least not Classical Latin. Just like I could understand somebody speaking really poor and bastardized English, and they could understand me, Cicero and the people could communicate through Latin but that doesn't mean that a scholar in Classical Latin could understand Vulgar Latin! Just like a Frenchman who learned English, even if they spent 10 years out of 20 to learn it, couldn't really understand Ebonics.    Finally, yes, finally, we do know far better than you indicate how ancient Greek and Latin were pronounced. There were several treatises on it (such as Varro's De Lingua Latina), but more importantly, we know from mistakes how things were actually pronounced. We know that in Koine η (eta) and ει (ei diphthong) collapsed with ι (iota), because of frequent misspellings in the papyri. In the Vindolanda tablets, the aspirate was lost in many instances, for example the intervocalic aspirate in cohors was lost and then, in writing, misplaced, so we end up with ""chors"". They knew an h was in there somewhere!   ""We can make approximations but we don't know exactly how everything was pronounced""   Oh, and speaking of which, the very existence of the Vindolanda tablets, private letters from low-level military leaders and their wives to each other, fundamentally disproves what you have to say about Latin not being common. This is about as common as you get.   ""The Roman people most commonly spoke Greek or Vulgar Latin.""  Is what I said... apparently that means I said Latin was not common.   You're wrong, stop touting your Master's and admit it. You read my post wrong or you jumped to conclusions and assumed I was spreading the same misinformation that I often see on this subject. I know what I'm talking about."
RomeSweetRome,2v25mc,sje46,0,Sat Feb 7 23:07:34 2015 UTC,"You literally have no idea what you're talking about. None. Have you even read any vulgar Latin? Can you trace its origin? Hint, go read J. N. Adams again. Anyone in first century CE Rome who did not study Classical models could still perfectly 100% understand them. Vulgar Latin isn't a different language. Everything else you say is just special pleading.   Okay once again you've not read what I said. I said that a modern person who was transmitted back in time and had studied classical latin, would not be able to understand Vulgar Latin.    You still are wrong. Even if a Roman would learn Greek, that Roman would not cease to be a ""barbarian"". Read the stuff I sent you. Barbarian is category of being non-Greek.   Really so a Roman using the word Barbarus would called themselves a Barbarus because they weren't Greek?  e: I don't want to discuss this with you anymore. You're either not reading my responses or you're twisting it in your mind. Everything you said affirmed what I said or was a strawman version of what I had actually said."
RomeSweetRome,2v25mc,TheScienceNigga,1 point,Sun Feb 8 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"Do you think we who study Latin for decades couldn't understand them enough to communicate? That's what I meant by special pleading. You've no evidence that this is the case, and people who study foreign language can and in fact regularly do pick up slang, lingo, and dialectal differences all the time. Seriously, read a book.   Yes they pick up slang after spending time to learn it. I am talking about a first contact situation, not a Roman and US solider dating for months talking to each other and learning to communicate.    Re: Romans and barbarians, it might be helpful to realize that Romans co-opted Greek culture, and traced their (fictional) ancestry through the Aeolians (a branch of the Greeks). Likewise, they did so through Aeneas and the Trojans, who, too, if you go back far enough, were related to Greeks. So they could for most of their history connect themselves to Greeks and escape being called barbarians.   I never said this was false. We're talking about Romans though and how they would view the world. We're not talking about the Greeks.    I translate it thus: For I heard that the head of a Barbarian poet is supported, over whom two guards ever keep constant watch.   I can translate it myself thank you.   My whole argument was discussing Roman views and uses of the word Barbarus, not Greek use of the word Barbaros. My whole argument was discussing the fact that Vulgar Latin is not easily understood by a Modern Scholar of Classical Latin. If your argument is ""they could learn"" well they could learn having no latin background at all too if given enough time but I was talking about first contact.  You didn't explain how I was wrong, all you said was the Greek perspective was different (of course it is)."
RomeSweetRome,2v25mc,afrustratedfapper,1 point,Sun Feb 8 03:45:52 2015 UTC,"a) Romans didn't speak Latin (demonstrably false),   I never made this claim   b) barbarus literally means ""one who can't speak Greek"" because all Romans spoke Greek or vulgar Latin (wrong on the first part, just nonsensical on the latter)   Barbarus does mean ""One who does not speak greek"" and the second part I never said.   c) vulgar Latin is not easily understood by a modern scholar of Classical Latin, which is just mind-numbingly ignorant.   That's because you seem to think its a minor pronunciation difference. It's not a minor pronunciation difference. It's slurring words dropping terminal letters and syllables. It's using words where a Classical speaker wouldn't such as ""Jar"" for ""head"".   These are not things which a Classical Latin speaker would pick up on in a first contact.   I only say you agree with me because you basically come to me after I say ""2 + 2 = 4!"" and you say ""no no no you're wrong, 2 + 1 does not equal 4! It equals 3! 2 + 2 = 4!""   In other words, you're saying what I've already said but you're nitpicking and holding up strawmen against me.   things I never said that you say I said:   Latin was not common They only spoke Greek The Greeks would not consider Romans Barbarians It's impossible to learn slang   Things I actually said but you seem to think I didn't   The Romans spoke Vulgar Latin The Romans sometimes spoke greek The Romans wouldn't consider themselves Barbari but considered non-Greek speaking people to be Barbari Classical Latin was used in speeches, official documents, and in the senate    Things I said in my OP which were technically incorrect   The romans created the word Barbarus (I never said this but I insinuated it)    Things which you think are wrong but are actually correct if you just apply some logic to it instead of being too pompous   Classical Latin scholars would have difficulty understanding Vulgar latin until they had spent time being exposed to it   I will go over the reasoning for the Vulgar latin point again just in case you still don't get it.   There are two points here.   Somebody who learns a language but doesn't learn the slang or bastardized version of it would have trouble understanding that slang or that bastardized version of it. This is simple fact. People who come to the United States from other countries and have learned English simply do not know slang and do not understand it.    For example: If I were to say ""You have a stupid head"" in Classical latin a Classical Latin scholar would easily comprehend and respond. If I were to say ""You have a stupid jar"" as would somebody using slang of Vulgar Latin, it would not be easily understood. In addition, syllables are cut off and it doesn't sound quite like Classical Latin.   You argue that people can learn slang etc This is true. I never said it wasn't true. The issue is we're talking about a first contact situation. Two people meeting for the first time, we're not talking about two people having time to learn to communicate."

How about ""The forever war"". Here's an excerpt that may remind you of the training in the battle room (This scene takes place on Charon, moon of Pluto. Damn near absolute zero): ""Now everybody pay close attention. I'm going out to that blue slab of ice"" it was a big one, about twenty meters away-' 'and show you something that you'd better know if you want to stay alive."" He walked out in a dozen confident steps. ""First I have to heat up a rock- filters down."" I squeezed the stud under my armpit and the filter slid into place over my image converter. The captain pointed his finger at a black rock the size of a basketball, and gave it a short burst. The glare rolled along shadow of the captain over us and beyond. The rock shattered into a pile of hazy splinters. ""It doesn't take long for these to cool down.""He stopped and picked up a piece. ""This one is probably twenty or twenty-five degrees. Watch.""He tossed the ""warm"" rock onto the ice slab. It skittered around in a crazy pattern and shot off the side. He tossed another one, and it did the same. ""As you know, you are not quite perfectly insulated. These rocks are about the temperature of the soles of your boots. If you try to stand on a slab of hydrogen, the same thing will happen to you. Except that the rock is already dead. ""The reason for this behavior is that the rock makes a slick interface with the ice- a little puddle of liquid hydrogen-and rides a few molecules above the liquid on a cushion of hydrogen vapor. This makes the rock or you a frictionless bearing as far as the ice is concerned, and you can't stand up without any friction under your boots. ""After you have lived in your suit fora month or so you should be able to survive falling down, but right now you just don't know enough. Watch."" The captain flexed and hopped up onto the slab. His feet shot out from under him and he twisted around in midair, landing on hands and knees. He slipped off and stood on the ground.""The idea is to keep your exhaust tins from making contact with the frozen gas. Compared to the ice they areas hot as a blast furnace, and contact with any weight behind it will result in an explosion."""

RomeSweetRome,2aekwd,SimpleRy,6,Fri Jul 11 14:02:33 2014 UTC,"So far, it's hard to say. It's just the very beginning of the story, and you haven't gone into a lot of detail yet. My instincts are telling me that you might benefit from holding off on the constant action until you develop your characters more and set some stakes.   You usually can't go wrong in early chapters by establishing your setting and main character, and then picking up with the main plot of the story. Basics would be that your main character has some sort of problem, and a strong desire to get this thing that they want.   It seems like James is your main character, but I'm still kind of waiting to see what his main objective is aside from surviving, and ensuring the survival of his kid. There doesn't have to be anything else, but it would help if he had a goal of some kind to work toward. A place for safety, a way to fix the bug with the machines, etc.   But take your time. You have a lot happening really fast, which is generally a good thing for a story, but a breakneck pace like this is a bit much right out of the gate. Give the reader some time to breathe and figure out what's going on.  Hope this helps. I don't want to presume to give you tons of advice or anything, but I figured I'd give my impression. It's good, I'll keep reading."

The Tom Cruise movie just came out.    I'm still confused by the idea that the producers apparently only look at one film at a time.  Is that true?    Anyways still (relatively) high hopes.  Hollywood is ridiculously slow with making more movies--it's only fast with sequels to very popular things.  It isn't even in development hell yet.  It may seem like it is, but it really isn't.

JH wrote him back, and said basically 'no sweat, don't worry about it, and i hope your RSR project goes well'.

RomeSweetRome,1yzirq,darkhorn,12,Wed Feb 26 13:19:13 2014 UTC,"Identification of this type of stuff is often tricky as the romans had a lot of different types of helmet in circulation at any given time as ever improvement needed time to arrive to every frontline soldier. We also have precious few sources on the equipment, the main one being good ole Vegetius.  The neckguard seems almost horizontal, it is made of iron with brass parts. My best guess would be that it is a reproduction of an imperial gallic helmet of the type used between 45 and 105 AD.  Examples of it have been found in Central Europe and in East England. It is probably the helmet considered most typical of the roman soldiers of this time.   Vegetius tells us that the longitudinal crest was for legionnaries so this would be a standard grunt helmet, probably a parade version."

Please understand that we have many amazingly preserved helmets, and we have some that arnt so preserved and that conjecture was used for its reconstruction, my late roman koblenz helmet for example.  If you'd like to see some of these go to the helmets page of romancoins.info  The 'trooper' helmet was created by a company called depeeka back in the day and has been copied by many mass armor makers in india. It corresponds with NO finds, and is based on nothing more than a cursory glance at an imperial gallic helmet. The lobster tail back, the puffy cheek pieces, the soldered centurion crest on most - this is al fantasy. Not conjecture, made up."

RomeSweetRome,1wirel,five_cacti,2,Thu Jan 30 07:37:03 2014 UTC,"Spellcross:      Spellcross: The Last Battle (Spellcross: Ostatnia bitwa in Polish; Spellcross: Poslední bitva in Czech) is a turn-based DOS strategy game for the PC, developed by a slovak company Cauldron HQ and published by SCi in 1997/1998. For a variety of reasons (notably, a relatively nonexistent marketing budget and the emergence of games dominated by the demands of 3D-graphics cards), unfortunately for its designers, the game had little mass appeal, sold poorly, and has remained obscure.  In Spellcross, a contemporary Earth military fights for survival against an extradimensional invasion of orcs, undead, harpies and other fantastical creatures.  The game only features a single-player mode, split into tactical battles and a strategic planning mode. The former is the actual combat, each unit has action points, which can be used to commit actions such as attack or move, or reserved for opportunity fire or movement. Resource and troop management, research, maps, territory acquisition and counter-attacks tie the scenarios together in a rudimentary narrative.

RomeSweetRome,1vts1h,saberactual,24,Wed Jan 22 04:38:32 2014 UTC,"I'm no historian, but I'll take a shot at speculation:  This paper speculates that the Greek paid about ~1 obol per sheet of paper made of papyrus. 1 obol is worth 1/6 of a drachma(src), and 1 drachma is about a days wages for a skilled laborer. (In the US this might be ~$100)  So we could round that to $15/sheet of papyrus.  $15 * 500 sheets (a ream) = $7500  But then, if we're talking a ream of modern milled paper, I'd imagine that'd be much, much more valuable because of its quality compared to papyrus. So, a fortune.  Other sources I used:  http://ancientcoinsforeducation.org/content/view/79/98/  http://jaysromanhistory.com/romeweb/writers/art2.htm"

I don't know what context you're using this in, but if it helps the Roman Empire was incredibly concerned with education. Because of the cost of papyrus students typically used hollowed tablets filled with wax and scribed on those with chisels. Even their equivalent of newspaper was chiseled on stone.  Libraries and written knowledge were a thing of great prestige at the time. Using the context of this subreddit, if I were to imagine a Roman being presented with 500 sheets of A4, it would be treated as a national treasure."

RomeSweetRome,1snxb0,sje46,2,Fri Jan 24 21:09:37 2014 UTC,"Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Acadia :      Acadia (French: Acadie) was a colony of New France in northeastern North America that included parts of eastern Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and modern-day Maine to the Kennebec River. During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southern-most settlements of Acadia. The actual specification by the French government for the territory refers to lands bordering the Atlantic coast, roughly between the 40th and 46th parallels. Later, the territory was divided into the British colonies which became Canadian provinces and American states. The population of Acadia included members of the Wabanaki Confederacy and descendants of emigrants from France (i.e., Acadians). The two communities inter-married, which resulted in a significant portion of the population of Acadia being Métis.     Picture  image source | about | /u/canadianatsea can reply with 'delete'.

RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,sje46,14,Sun Sep 1 05:47:31 2013 UTC,"I'm holding out hope that this ama doesn't confirm my fears that hollywood has rewritten it to be call of duty:time travel, rome edition. Those hopes I'm holding aren't very high though."
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,flexd,28,Sun Sep 1 01:06:04 2013 UTC,"He said before that the second scriptwriter made it be about only a small unit of special forces operatives (or whatever), instead of an entire MEU or something of similar size.  I really, really don't like that.  Because that just screams ""generic action film"".  A generic time-travel action film.  The beauty of Rome Sweet Rome, the essence of it, was the thought experiment itself.  Could they take on the Roman empire?  If it's a team of five buff action heros, the answer is ""yes"", because they wouldn't be taking on the army in big battles, but trying to infiltrate something.  And hollywood logic dictates that in those kinds of movies, the action heroes would win.  The idea of an army versus an army is so much more intriguing."
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,effedup,6,Sun Sep 1 06:06:32 2013 UTC,"I totally agree, but I kind of feel it'll end up being 5-10 characters we know about (max) and however big a MEU is of people we do not see or interact with or hear the story of at all.  For a long-running series like BSG a big gang of people would be good because you have lots of stories to go through, personal problems and so on.  But for a movie that is going to be like 3 hours at an absolute max (which is very long). It's very hard to tell you enough about the characters to cover more than a few of them.  Which in a movie like Troy for example is fine, because you know like 5 characters on the greek side, all of which lead a batallion or whatever like that.  I think doing that with present day troops would be a bit odd?  Just people dying all the time but you would have no connection with them or know anything about them?  Consider how it was in Band of Brothers, where you actually knew the name and a bit of the story behind everyone that died, which was done in a really good way."
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,flexd,5,Sun Sep 1 10:31:06 2013 UTC,.. what if it was made into a TV series..
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,sje46,-1,Wed Sep 4 17:31:21 2013 UTC,"It'd have to be a 'million' seasons to cover a whole MEU worth of characters. I think maybe 10 at the very most characters is what a TV show could handle, and a bit less for a movie."
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,flexd,4,Thu Sep 5 00:59:23 2013 UTC,Why the hell do you think they're supposed to have a story arc for every single person in the MEU?    It is not bad scriptwriting to have a ton of characters in an organization of a sort to not even have any lines at all.
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,sje46,-2,Thu Sep 5 06:26:28 2013 UTC,"I do not think they are supposed to have a story arc for everyone.  A MEU is like 2200 people. It would be odd to bring 2200 people back in time but only tell the story of a tiny amount of them.  I liked how Generation Kill did it, but again, that is a series with more time to build characters."
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,flexd,6,Thu Sep 5 08:34:51 2013 UTC,"How would that be odd at all?  Did you think it was odd how Spartacus didn't have a storyline for each and every slave in the revolt?  That would be ludicrous.  There is absolutely nothing ""odd"" about it at all."
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,sje46,-1,Thu Sep 5 09:27:53 2013 UTC,"As you said in the original comment, the second writer made it into a special forces team or something instead?  It would be odd to have 2200 people go back in time but only cover the story of like 5 of them.  I'm not saying EVERYONE should have a story, I do not know where you got that from."
RomeSweetRome,1lgqd2,endercoaster,5,Thu Sep 5 09:30:23 2013 UTC,"I do not see what relevance the size of the army has, at all.  You keep saying how odd it would be to have a storyline with 2200 but only focus on a small handful of them.  There are tons of examples of books, movies, shows, etc, that do this.  A ton of science fiction, for example.  You are making it sound like there would be something really off if they did that, but it really wouldn't be, at all.    It is not a valid criticism."

Let me provide a little bit more context for that. Posted on Facebook April 1   Guys, it's been a while but I have some exciting news. I've seen the new screenwriter's second draft and there are some changes to the script. I wasn't sure about them at first, but I am really on board and I can't wait for you to see this film.  -The MEU has been replaced by a small Special Forces unit.   -Ancient Rome has been replaced by World War II France.  -Augustus Caesar is now Hitler.   -The Special Forces are all Jewish convicts.  -Brad Pitt(!!!!) has signed on to play the leader of this unit.   -The time travel angle has been removed.

RomeSweetRome,1bull8,exessmirror,47,Tue Apr 16 15:45:15 2013 UTC,"I don't care if special forces are better trained.    The problem with this plot is that it very strongly indicates a particular bro-action movie.  Something like The Expendables.  It took away the thing that most people found intriguing about the concept, which is the question of if an MEU can take on and presumably invade all of Rome.  It's a thinker that invites debate.    A generic sci-fi action thriller with a force of ultra-elite special forces would be shit.  Who gives a flying fuck about how good the American soldiers are, anyway?  Maybe I don't want to root for them?"
RomeSweetRome,1bull8,crackerdoctor,35,Mon Apr 8 04:06:43 2013 UTC,"^ THIS. sje46 is right.  I really like this story and it would make a good movie but it has to be an entire unit of thousands strong. A movie was made with this concept back in the 80s. It was a meh movie but I thought the premise was incredible and never forgot it.  It has to be thousands vs the Romans. Special forces are better trained, but so are the Romans. Special forces aren't combat engineers, some aren't shitting their pants because they are in fucking Rome and can't come to grips, others that are history buffs are in awe of Caesar, while others have delusions of grandeur of being gods because they have a lighter. It's not the training of the soldiers that makes it interesting. (A dozen special forces guys vs a Roman legion is no contest. The Romans have a insurmountable number advantage and have the edge in hand to hand combat and don't have to worry about supplies.)  It's all about the technology vs the numbers. Both have the best armies in the world. A few dozen anything can't take over a country, but a few thousand might. Plus there's the question of what could a man like Caesar do if he got his hands on a few modern weapons."

RomeSweetRome,1bull8,robozombiejesus,34,Fri May 17 11:52:05 2013 UTC,"Which was the whole point of the story anyway, if one MEU could take down the Roman Empire before they ran out of supplies. With a special forces group that's only like twelve guys, once they're out of ammo it's over to."
RomeSweetRome,1bull8,scientologist2,21,Sun Apr 7 18:39:25 2013 UTC,"But special forces are sufficiently bad-ass that they might go undetected, and be able to slip into town, if they were not especially taller than their competition.  So it is a totally different sort of story.  And Augustus was no fool. He likely understood logistics from a roman viewpoint very well. Also, Augustus was seen as a good protector of Rome. He was the guy who originally had the title of ""Prince of Peace"" etc. Not that Jesus fellow."
RomeSweetRome,1bull8,kenjisan231,19,Sun Apr 7 18:54:30 2013 UTC,"They MIGHT be able to hide, but that they could take down the whole Roman Empire seems far fetched. It's changed the entirety of the story, the movie isn't going to be anything like the story that started this subreddit."
RomeSweetRome,1bull8,IamUnimportant,6,Sun Apr 7 19:00:46 2013 UTC,"very true. Although some men have done more with less.  No if they went in and took out Caligula or Nero, they would likely have a bit more support.  And I would not put it past a special forces team to have someone who was an expert in latin, because it would be a badass hobby to have. (reading Ceasar in the original latin, just for the insight into the military mind sort of thing)"

RomeSweetRome,17bq69,Nyhlis,14,Sat Jan 26 18:37:32 2013 UTC,You could also reason that the time stream required 31st century game show addicts to send the marines back in time and that those killed never had any descendants anyway. To prevent the game show would be the paradox in the first place.

RomeSweetRome,17bq69,sje46,6,Sun Jan 27 02:31:31 2013 UTC,"Does it matter why it happened?  Sometimes, trying to explain why something that happens makes the whole thing seem silly. Treat it as a matter of fact, the time shift happened and leave it at that. Do the Marines (or the Spec Ops guys in the movie) really need to know? Does the viewer? How does it make a difference other than forcing an explanation for something.  Its something that was used quite well in Cloverfield and in the Walking Dead. Sometimes a little mystery is a good thing."
RomeSweetRome,17bq69,davidyourduke,0,Sun Jan 27 06:07:23 2013 UTC,"Well, the central problem with all those extraordinary stories is the suspension of disbelief. The Walking Dead works, because there are so many people who ""love"" the thought of the zombie apocalypse, so, since they wanted to buy into the scenario, they could.  I am just afraid that RSR without any background will just look like Hollywood was trying to make some easy money and no one will be engaged in what's going on."
RomeSweetRome,17bq69,brokenarrow,5,Sun Jan 27 08:24:38 2013 UTC,"Totally disagree.  Over-explained contrived backgrounds are actually a staple of terrible sci-fi-y movie writings. Think of the new TMNT movie where the turtles are going to be interdimensional aliens.  Over-explaned.  Just make them mutated turtles.  People don't love the Walking Dead just because of the idea, they love it because it's well executed...similarly, they may hate other zombie media because they're not well executed.  Suspension of disbelief is never the problem with a movie.  It's a vital part of any kind of sci-fi or fantasy movie.  Does the fact that none of the stuff in Harry Potter explained (or could exist in our universe) make it shitty?  It's so much satisfying to go into a movie where they're placed into a really weird explanation that is never explained.  Really.  Read Metamorphosis. It's never explained why the guy is turned into a giant bug, nor should it be, because that would ruin the entire story.  It's reality, it's not explained, and you have to deal with it.    http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OntologicalMystery  It should be mysterious, because it would make the film much more intriguing.  Your idea is interesting (and I actually really want some kind of screenplay or something dealing with a very similar idea), but doesn't fit in Rome Sweet Rome, and really shouldn't."
RomeSweetRome,17bq69,racergr,0,Sun Jan 27 20:46:24 2013 UTC,"I am not convinced that you are right regarding this particular movie and I am fairly certain that there is a need for explanation once sequels are made (and we are talking about Hollywood here, so expect vikings vs. samurai etc...). Because when you have a single movie, Romans vs. Marines (or whoever), you might get away without any explanation. But when you want to watch the sequel and suddenly there are samurais and vikings fighting, that will probably look like Hollywood was trying to make lots of money with a basic idea without putting any thought or effort behind it."

RomeSweetRome,17bq69,Cardboard_Boxer,3,Sat Jan 26 22:29:33 2013 UTC,"And if you don't like parallel universes: you can argue that if you time-travel far enough into the past then your  actions change the future but the changes are not detectable and do not affect the overall course of time/progress.  For example, if I go back and kill 10 dinosaurus, it would have no effect in our current state of the world. Tings eventually even-out.  So your scenario could work if the ""bored"" super-humans are living far enough into the future, not just 31st century, but something like 60th or 100th century.   Alternatively, you can keep it fairly close to the present (31st century) and say that the pitting of old armies is orchestrated by a Hitler-like figure who wants to study ancient Strategy techniques, and who does not give a shit of what will happen to the present."

Than I saw the post about WB changing it to special forces and I lost my excitement. I agree with you that if it is a budget issue I would gladly accept a scaled down force of marines over a group of special forces. I think part of what excited me about these story is the scale of it, an entire MEU could have drastic actions in ancient rome, while staying contained to themselves. A group of Spec Ops has much less power. For one its easily possible for Romans to kill them in sheer numbers. They cant have any major affects on Rome without exchanging the tech they know and allow them to examine their small arms. But where are the helicopters, humvees, and a full camp :("

RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,Ekiph,12,Thu Apr 11 07:37:54 2013 UTC,"I'm sorry, I totally disagree.  I know that cynicism is popular on reddit, and cynicism about Hollywood and the general public is even higher, but I still don't think that's going to happen.  I really don't.  After I heard about the changes to the script and the new head-writer, my hopes severely plummeted.  But I still think that they're going to speak Latin.  As long as the movie still involves modern English speakers interacting with ancient Romans, we will have Latin.  Even with the new shitty screenwriter.  It just wouldn't work, at all, if they had the Romans speaking English.  Romans speaking English works just fine for Gladiator and Rome (HBO) because, well, you don't have to reflect on the fact they're speaking English.  But absolutely no way will there be a scene where the two groups are comfortably speaking English together.  Absolutely zero.    One of the first things nearly everyone will think when the Americans go back in time to the Romans is ""How will they communicate?""  If they have that kind of cop-out, the movie will get HORRIBLE reviews, and people would mock it forever.  Hollywood may have some shitty films, but they are still professional.  They will know that this will be a good source of conflict and that ignoring the language barrier for an adult film about two alien cultures would be disastrous.    Cynicism won't change the fact that WB wouldn't allow such a thing to occur.  To deal with the ""horde of dumb masses"" they will just have English subtitles when the Romans speak. The worst case scenario, I think, is the Romans speaking English with each other, but Latin to the Americans.  Even with the shitty new screenwriter, I am fully confident that Latin will be preserved."

RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,kithkatul,-1,Wed Feb 27 00:59:03 2013 UTC,I'm ok with this. I hate subtitles and making all those people speak a different language just for the novel sake? Fuck that
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,Gella321,17,Thu Jan 17 05:20:10 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I'd forgive the language thing if it was the only thing.  Not a huge priority to make the actors speak proper latin.  But since its going to be crap anyways, its just one more reason added the pile."
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,InVultusSolis,9,Thu Jan 17 05:35:46 2013 UTC,"Shit - the military guys especially weren't speaking proper Latin. They were speaking some bastardized form of it, which is probably difficult to reproduce being that it was primarily a spoken language. Although it probably would've sounded similar to how modern Italian sounds today (at least in Rome). Remember, the Romance languages that we know today derived from the vulgar Latin that was spoken among the lower classes. Hence why ""horse"" in proper Latin is ""equos"", but in today's Spanish it would translate to ""caballo"" which comes from ""caballus"", a Celtic word.  Proper Latin, I believe, was mainly used by the State and Religious bodies - for official communications. Second, the high command/aristocracy would be speaking Greek to each other, most likely."
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,Gella321,2,Thu Jan 17 16:19:59 2013 UTC,"For the amount of ""proper"" written Latin, there seems to be a stark shortage of documentation of the common speech of the time. There are a few scribbled lines, and a few transcribed church sermons in what is called ""Vulgar Latin"", but by and large it was never really written down. For example, I don't think there's a canonical story of how Latin speakers switched from ""equus"" to ""caballus"", a seemingly random shift."
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,Gella321,1 point,Thu Jan 17 16:49:50 2013 UTC,"Which, I wonder has to do with the lower literacy levels of common Romans. In addition, maybe there was a reluctance from the higher classes to actually acknowledge the vulgar form of Latin as they most likely weren't communicating together on a regular basis. The upper classes would've had slaves that were well versed in Greek or proper Latin to interact with their upper class masters.  I am guessing the switch to ""caballus"", for example, had more to do with the legacy of the Gauls, Celts, etc. being in their land for much longer and these words just replacing the proper Latin words. Maybe this is why the spread and integration of the empire was so successful - the political bodies of the time understood that the people they were ruling over would be more agreeable to being ruled if they were allowed to integrate as much of their culture as possible.   In general, I believe the Romans were pretty agreeable to other cultures. Basically, ""let us put soldiers in your lands, pay us some taxes and just don't give us too much trouble and you can keep doing your thing""."
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,Jackpot777,2,Thu Jan 17 17:59:23 2013 UTC,"Yeah - I do seem to recall reading that plays, shows, etc that were aimed at the masses were performed in 'street' Latin, which makes sense."
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,sje46,0,Thu Jan 17 20:01:49 2013 UTC,"As the person that modified the design of the RSR Facebook design so the logo in the Profile pic merged into the Cover image... I just want to say that I have a British accent (born in Yorkshire, lived and worked just north of London). And I live in the US (Pennsylvania). And I bet I look pretty smart in a toga. And I did a few months of Latin in school so I remember things like ""puer et pueri sub arbore favorant"" was something to do with a boy and a girl getting frisky, or meeting, or SOMETHING, under a tree...  Pick me! PICK ME!"
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,Simbrian,2,Thu Jan 17 20:57:57 2013 UTC,"Boy and boys favor under the tree?  Well, I'm assuming ""favor"" since there's no such thing as ""favorant""."

RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,E-Squid,45,Mon Jan 21 04:17:15 2013 UTC,"Wouldn't the language barrier be a major part of the conflict? They could easily settle any misunderstandings right then and there if both parties spoke English. This whole movie feels very rushed, in my opinion.  Roman: ""So where are you from?""  Marine: ""We're from the future, it seems. Don't worry; we mean you no harm and we're not looking for a fight.""  Roman: ""Okay then; you can stay with us until you figure things out.""  I have a very bad feeling this movie is going to be one of those ""awesome concept; terrible execution"" stories."
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,endercoaster,21,Wed Jan 16 22:51:49 2013 UTC,That's actually an excellent point. The language barrier is largely the source of the conflict. Asking the actors to learn Latin might be too much though.
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,sje46,17,Wed Jan 16 23:01:08 2013 UTC,"They don't need to learn it really. Speaking the lines need not be too hard to pull off either, especially since there is no proper Latin accent or dialect to my knowledge to offend an audience. At the very least I'd reckon only scholars would pick up on bad Latin - a small percentage eh?"
RomeSweetRome,16pnu1,RockabillyRebel,7,Thu Jan 17 06:00:07 2013 UTC,"At the very least though, the spoken Latin would need to sound consistent - you couldn't have one guy speaking it with a pseudo-Italian accent while another guy pronounces stuff with an obvious Spanish inflection. (Note, however, that scholars estimate that Latin probably did sound like how Italian is pronounced today, and that the excuse of ""they're from different parts of the empire"" isn't very plausible) Consistency in pronunciation would be the most basic thing to get right, and then if it's not so much trouble they could try for an approximation of the original pronunciation/accent.

A quick overview of basic Latin grammar (such as teaching them what the hell a declension is), stuff about word order and pronunciation, and they'll be good to go.  They won't have to translate Cicero; they just have to read the lines they're given.  I would give them a script that has the equivalent English words/phrases above the Latin, so the actor would understand which words to inflect, where to pause, etc.  Hell, I could probably do this for them.

RomeSweetRome,16kp3z,ewar-woowar,4,Mon Jan 14 22:05:54 2013 UTC,"How so? It would make for a smaller cast and you don't want a platoon of characters in a film, you just don't end up caring about any because they have to divide up screen time so much. In that vein, they're probably cutting a lot from the original idea so it will be trim enough for a movie. As the phrase goes ""You can make a good movie out of anything, sometimes you just have to rip its guts out though."" I agree with endercoaster further down this thread, would probably fit better as a mini-series."
RomeSweetRome,16kp3z,Purple10tacle,77,Mon Jan 14 23:33:48 2013 UTC,"Because it's an entirely different movie. A small group of U.S. Special Forces going back in time is the plot of generic survival action movie - they may just as well have been stranded in the jungles of Vietnam or the Iraq desert with limited resources - it's boring and unoriginal and has been done before dozens of times, usually badly. It's ""Rambo goes to Rome"" not the ""Rome, Sweet Rome"" we fell in love with.  An entire army base going back in time is a very different beast. In theory and at the peak of their power, they would be the world's strongest forces, able to single-handedly overthrow the entire Roman Empire. But rapidly dwindling resources would stop them just as much as politics and betrayal. This the fascinating, deep, tense and original SciFi movie we wanted this to be but will most likely never get."

RomeSweetRome,16kp3z,pragmatick,17,Tue Jan 15 19:44:10 2013 UTC,I am pretty sure the reason for the change is that this movie will be low budget and filming a team of 4 or 5 guys against the romans costs a lot less than huge battle scenes with thousands of soldiers and choppers and what not.
RomeSweetRome,16kp3z,ewar-woowar,-7,Tue Jan 15 11:54:53 2013 UTC,"Yeah well, did you not read the ""rip its guts out"" part? Think of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Blade Runner.

RomeSweetRome,16kp3z,kaptainkeel,47,Tue Jan 15 11:47:33 2013 UTC,"Simply because it has a 'platoon' of soldiers in it doesn't mean every one of them is going to get screen time. The majority would likely be in the background, with just a few main characters. When I think of 'Special Forces', I think of an elite, small 4-man unit (or similarly small unit, maybe 8 men max). That's not what RSR is. RSR has choppers, an actual military base... you can't do that with a tiny group of 4-8 people. If it goes this route, I see it being more like Timeline (2003) but in Rome with Special Forces.  Mini-series... you wouldn't have near the budget or story continuation as a movie. The producers or writers would likely add in useless elements to keep it going longer as that happens for almost all mini-series.  My prediction if this goes with Special Forces: We're gonna see a cliche action movie with a small set of heroes (4-6) that gets thrown back in time, and then they have to race against the clock to get a piece of a technology or to a specific place to get back home. Throw in a few flashbacks to the previous morning/day with them thinking about their wife and kids to inflict emotions upon the audience."

RomeSweetRome,16kp3z,sje46,5,Tue Jan 15 04:19:52 2013 UTC,"Won't the scale of the challenge seem harder?   No, on a few levels.  First you have to consider what the goals would be between the ""five men surviving in strange place"" movie and an ""Army battle against other army"" movie would be.  For the first, it would almost certainly be to get back to where they were.  With the second, it would be more about conquering the opposing threat so they're no longer a threat.  I'd argue it may be easier for four or five men to try to blend into the environment, do what they need to do, and win.  There wouldn't be any sort of battle with tens of thousands of legionaires battling five men.  But I mean even if you are right (which you kinda are), yes, five men don't stand a chance.  But with movie-watching logic they kinda do stand more of a chance.  Think about it.  When you're watching a movie about one guy taking on the entire world, your mind automatically thinks that one guy actually has a chance.  Think of Rambo--it's kinda what the genre is.  But for a war movie, your brain goes into logistics mode.  The entire point of this high concept movie is to make you think ""wait, who would win?"" and you start having a debate with yourself.  Is the Roman army doomed because of their vastly inferior technology?  Is the American military doomed because of their relative lack of numbers and reliance on technology that will soon run out of power?  And then you think of possible cultural/time things.  How will Americans manage to communicate to the Romans?   Stuff like that.  We all signed up because of the idea, not because of the challenge.  We want intellectual tension, not....Rambo tension."

The first draft was just finished three months ago.  I don't think they even got the second one yet.  There's a lot that goes into a film.  Finalizing the script, finding actors, director, crew, building sets, and so on.  We'll know when they start filming, and it won't be for years.  We will go months without seeing any updates in the meantime, until it's officially announced about a year before it actually comes out.  The guy was just making a pun.  It's not even going to be called Rome Sweet Rome.  Again, it will probably be years before we start seeing any actual filming.  Think 2015.  Maaaybe 2014 if we're lucky."

He didn't lose interest.  He stopped publishing on reddit in order to write it as a movie, which he has.  All we have is those 8 days."

If one of the premium providers like HBO or Showtime picked it up as a limited or mini series (10-20 episodes) than yes, this would be awesome, it would be enough time to develop the story, characters, and have a few battles along with a nice conclusion at the end."

But to pull it off as a movie where it's not going to be cheesy will be difficult.  Honestly I see it being one of those movies that are released during seasonal downtime when there's no blockbuster releases, with a cast that no one's ever heard of.

If you were an executive producer for a major studio, would you rush the process?  Would you be okay with a script that has only been worked on for a month?  It takes years.  Like, maybe five years on average.  And this is a war film.  This will likely be around $200 million budget.  (Not something you want to rush on).  It isn't ""fucking taking forever"".  You just don't understand shit about the movie industry.  Here's a hint: I'd be surprised if they finalized the script in this year.  Be patient."

Him having to pass on the script may not mean he got ""fired"".  It doesn't mean he won't contribute anymore.  He will probably get his due credit and salary.  He is a first time screenwriter...it's probably to be expected he won't get final draft.  As far as I'm concerned, the fact that they're commissioning a second draft in the first place is a great sign.  Don't forget that he probably wasn't the sole writer anyways...there's probably an entire room full of writers that were going to change a crap-load of things anyways.  And about it being a Michael Bay explosion-packed thriller...of course it's going to be that.  He said himself that he already had to make a lot of sacrifices and had to write certain things in (he said you can't have a Hollywood summer blockbuster without a love interest, for one)."

So: for the moment, this bird has flown. In the future - three to four months at the earliest - the finished second draft will be chewed on by the studio and producers. It is entirely possible (but I'd say the odds are under 50-50) that I'll get another crack down the road.   This is tough. It really is. I put a lot into that draft. But this is how this industry works. This is what I signed up for. The best way to protect my work is to work hard, play fair, and stay visible. So: I'm actively working on a new project and still pitching ideas to Madhouse. And this particular story is far from done.   And if it is, well, someday when you least expect it I'll brush off my old outline and post the rest of the story as fan fiction."

It takes years to perfect the art of screenwriting, and that's why most authors don't adapt the books they write with a handful of very rare exceptions."
RomeSweetRome,xkbkp,robfrap,25,Thu Aug 2 17:19:41 2012 UTC,"It really doesn't have anything to do with him being a first time screenwriter. Everybody gets rewritten. It's a law of Hollywood. As Tom Lennon and Ben Garant (Reno 911) explain in their book Writing Movies for Fun and Profit, it's actually a good thing. If the studio is paying someone else to keep working on your project, it means they're still actively invested in making it a movie. You just have to take the big picture view."
RomeSweetRome,xkbkp,ungr8ful_biscuit,10,Thu Aug 2 23:03:30 2012 UTC,"Uhhh, yes it does.  Lots of people get rewritten, but it's debatable if it's a good thing.

Maybe not a great thing, but there is a silver lining.  It shows, first off, that they're still interested in the film, which is fantastic.  Not to mention the fact that the exec liked it.  Not bad for a first script.    Hopefully a lot of the script remains the same, and any changes to the script are improvements!  Also, if this becomes a thing, it will be great on his resume (writing the first script for a major Hollywood blockbuster?  Fuck yeah.).

Are they going to start with a modern-day scene...? Excited expert leads colleague off a landing chopper just off the coast of Italy, a small island with steep cliffs within the Natural Marine Protection Area of Ventotene and Santo Stefano (yes, it exists). ""This better be good,"" says the man fresh off the helicopter. ""See for yourself,"" answers the expert. The remains of a small settlement is there, a few stone walls and a faded mosaic on the floor being cleaned. Nothing that hasn't been seen before. Apart from the pattern of the small mosaic: the eagle, globe, and anchor of the United States Marine Corps. And a plate, partly broken, with the words ""Miles Nelson"" still legible."

That is enough to muddy the copyright waters to the point that the lawyers won't let him touch it.

And I'm not trying to be mean either, I'd honestly like to discuss the merits of having an idea vs. capitalizing upon it and what a person should be entitled to.  Very relevant, considering the huge debates over intellectual property and copyright going on right now."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,ungr8ful_biscuit,2,Tue Jul 17 23:37:18 2012 UTC,"And, also, for the record.  I'm sure both Prufrock and OP are great guys and nobody is ripping off anybody.  I just think the whole situation is fascinating and unprecedented (throw in the whole hive mind conundrum and the fact that Prufrock is being encouraged NOT to post here)."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,gnovos,1 point,Wed Jul 18 00:33:10 2012 UTC,"I definitely would love to discuss this with you (in a friendly way).  We'll get to your first sentence later as I'm curious what script ideas you came up, as I also write/produce in Hollywood.    But for starters, when Prufrock got paid, he hadn't written the script yet.  He wrote a very interesting series of posts based on the OP's original idea.  A Hollywood manager liked what he wrote, signed him, and they went out to different studios and sold a pitch, or a detailed proposal about the film they WANTED to write (again, based on somebody else's core idea).   Now that sad reality of Hollywood is that after Prufrock turns in his first draft, he'll most likely get re-written by a more established writer, who will then most likely go back to the core idea as he rewrites the script, a core idea that Prufrock didn't come up with (Marines go back in time to fight the Romans).   I say most likely because the less of Prufrock's specific details the new writer keeps in the script, the less chance the new writer will have to share credit, which means sharing money.    Anyway, my point is that Prufrock's got paid a lot of money for somebody else's idea.  Sure, he added a lot to that idea, but the core was somebody else's.  And there's a good chance that the core idea is all that makes it to the screen (if any idea at all as it's fucking hard to get a movie greenlit even with a completed script).  That being said, this is where it gets more interesting....  you can't copyright ideas... so legally Prufrock doesn't owe the OP anything... but ethically is a different story.  In Hollywood, producers hear pitches from writers all the time, and legally they don't need to pay the writer if they steal that idea (but don't use the writer to execute it), but ethically they do.  And most ethical producers (you could make a joke that there is no such thing) will pay a writer for their idea if it's good enough, let them take a stab at writing it, even if they know they're going to bring in a bigger writer later to rewrite it....  Because if they didn't, no writer would ever want to work with them.  It's the same reason that most writers don't steal their friends' ideas, even if they know they'll do a much better job executing it... as people here live and die by the strength of their ideas and it's never a good idea to just start feeling entitled to these ideas without compensation.     Does that make sense?  Hopefully it does."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,ungr8ful_biscuit,2,Wed Jul 18 00:25:18 2012 UTC,"Thank you so much, that makes a lot more sense.  Hollywood is my ambition, but my aim is directorial and I can sympathize much more with an opposing viewpoint that I will explain in a moment.  But I understand much better what you're saying about the environment and ethics of professional writing for film.  If I recall correctly, the author of the original idea was one who had proposed it and said something to the extent of: ""Reddit, someone write this!""  I doubt he ever expected a response, especially one of such quality.  Again if I recall, the user who proposed the idea claimed that he/she was not a writer and would never have really taken a stab at it anyway.  But let's say that the user was a writer and did want to execute a script himself.  The code of ethics you've described for script writers would certainly encourage Prufrock to have let him have the first go.  But two things rise up to me that challenge this idea.   The first is practical. Because we're chatting anonymously online, if you have ideas that you want to write you had better keep them to yourself.  This is an open forum, not a private conversation between you and your friends.  Posting an idea on Reddit is tantamount to giving others consenting carte blanche with your concepts.  This may not be your intent, but it's akin to putting out a press release that lets everyone know to get in before it's been done. The second point is along the same lines but distinctly different.  If I'm with a group of friends and one of them says something wacky or awesome, chances are that I'm not going to ask for their permission to go riff on that subject (granted, my friends aren't a bunch of authors).  It's true that without User Zero (whatever his/her name was) Prufrock might never have been inspired to write that exact script.  But an idea is maybe 5% of a production.  And Pru didn't just write an idea, he showed what he could make it feel like.  Anyone could have, but he was the one who put forth the effort and made something out of a concept.   So yes, I would say the original idea-holder should get some recognition.  Maybe his/her name in the credits at the end of the film?  But one distinction to make is that as much as anyone is concerned, the idea came from the internet.  Heck that one person could easily have stolen it from someone else, who knows?  And on the subject of the first part, I'm wary of putting any of my best stuff down on the internet without writing it first myself. =P"
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,gnovos,-1,Wed Jul 18 01:03:03 2012 UTC,"Hahahaha.  No you're totally right about OP perhaps taking the idea from somewhere else.  We'll never know.  And you're right about the other points as well, to a degree.  If the OP gave up his rights to get paid for this idea by posting it on the internet, then why didn't Prufrock do the same thing?  He was responding to hive mind feedback, changing and editing the idea as he went along.    My main bone of contention here is simple.  Prufrock is getting paid for an idea that he didn't come up with.  Now it seems like the OP doesn't want compensation... but that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve it.   Because it wasn't like he posted, ""Let's discuss the military prowess of Rome in 300 BC.""  And then somebody came up with an awesome story set in Rome that he sold.  Rather, the OP came up with the core premise of what will be the movie.  Later, when people talk about the film (assuming it gets made), they'll say, ""It was a movie about marines who go back to Rome and they get in a big war.""  That's EXACTLY the OP's premise.  Not Prufrock's....  So, I just think he deserves something for that.  Now, granted, this is all hypothetical, but it's definitely fun to think about it as it's all so unprecedented and the OP could potentially derail this project if he wanted to (no studio wants to make a movie with a disputed IP), but of course he won't because then the whole hive mind will hate him and he'll be the most despised redditor since Kleinbl00 (who I happen to know and who's also an aspiring screenwriter amongst other things but that's a whole different story)."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,ungr8ful_biscuit,2,Wed Jul 18 01:13:00 2012 UTC,"Anyway, my point is that Prufrock's got paid a lot of money for somebody else's idea.   Not exactly.  He got paid for writing something that hundreds of thousands of people wanted to see more of, the audience is what hollywood wanted to buy."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,gnovos,0,Sun Aug 26 00:23:01 2012 UTC,"I seriously doubt that. I work pretty high up in Hollywood (not to mention, I'm repped by the same management company as prufrock) and very few execs know what Reddit is or how to quantify the impact of its audience. They bought the idea.  And now somebody else is executing it."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,ungr8ful_biscuit,2,Sun Aug 26 02:30:35 2012 UTC,"That's silly.  It's not like this a completely new idea that nobody had thought of before when out drinking with friends, right?  They didn't have to buy anything, they could just have their own, seasoned writers write it up and pay nobody for it.  It was only a couple of paragraphs to begin with, all of which could easily be changed to get around any potential plagiarism complaints.  Why pay for anything that you don't have to?  Especially when this guy isn't a professional screen writer, that's a lot of risk."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,ungr8ful_biscuit,0,Sun Aug 26 02:53:53 2012 UTC,"You don't understand.  Prufrock's post got attention from a manager, he wrote a treatment (synopsis of screenplay), WB then bought that, the underlying idea, and also gave him a one step deal to execute the screenplay. At the top levels, it had nothing to do with reddit, it had to do with the strength of the idea.... Hollywood buys these kind of ideas all day every day with the hopes that they'll eventually become a movie... Most don't.  Anyway, I'm not sure why I'm explaining this to you... But there it is.... Also, for a first time screenwriter, there is very little risk as his fee is a drop in the bucket in regards to what they plan on planning to develop this idea. Typically, they'll spend 3% of a movie's budget on a screenplay (using multiple writers).  For a 100 million dollar movie, that's 3 million for the screenplay. Of course, Prufrock probably got about 90k for his part which means they have 2.91 million left to hire the writer that they want (and they still get all his work including the core idea). It's just how things work."
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,veruus,2,Sun Aug 26 04:01:00 2012 UTC,"Ah, well still, that manager would never have seen the thing without it being so popular.  I'm just saying if we're going to be giving out prizes to the OP that asked question, then we should give it to the upvoters, too, right?"
RomeSweetRome,wny6k,ungr8ful_biscuit,-1,Sun Aug 26 04:06:20 2012 UTC,"No.  Let's pretend that Prufrock is a comedian. One day, a talent agent goes to a club and sees two comedians riffing off each other and then decides to only hire one of them even though the material was coming from both of them, does he then have to hire the club as well (the club being Reddit of course) and pay the audience who is clapping? Of course not. Weak analogy but the best I can do. Two people came up with an idea. Only one person got paid for it. That doesn't sit well with me."

RomeSweetRome,w5xvc,grandpapete,3,Sat Jul 7 04:11:11 2012 UTC,"Even though I have nothing to do with this other than reading the story, I would say that the split between Roman flair and Marine flair changes depending on the scene, but it should stay pretty heavy towards the Marine side in the battles (at least for the 7 days of story I have read).  The Marines have 2,200 people when they first embark on their mission.  Assuming they lose about 10 (suicides, runaways, mental breakdowns, etc.), that still means that their only battles are with 50 Roman cavalrymen (only one Roman survivor) and 100 Praetorian Guards (to whom they try to make peace with).  Sure, scenes of the capital or the Guards' camp might show far more Romans than Marines, but the battlefield flair seems to stick mainly to the Marines (93.18/6.81 split).  Assuming their battles go any further (tales of thousands of veterans gathering in the capital as word of the Invasion spreads), that would be the moment Marine flair takes a dramatic drop for the bottom (the minimal definition of ""thousands"" would make the whole thing just 50 people shy of a 50/50 split).

Add a better micro/macro management system to make the scalability work and still be fun.  Also, no army size limits of, say ""20 cohorts"" etc., but rather, even though the engine can only support a limited size of armies on the actual field of battle, just adjust the ratios as appropriate. Million man army vs. 5,000? 200-1 ratio."

RomeSweetRome,u86ii,aurelius3,12,Mon May 28 03:27:51 2012 UTC,"You know, I recall Dan Carlin mentioning that the Romans often justified wars of aggression as being pre-emptive strikes upon neighbors who were supposedly about to attack Rome, but I've never seen any actual information about this. Can anyone link me to some?  EDIT: I started a thread about it in /r/ancientrome."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,EsquilaxHortensis,11,Mon May 28 05:01:36 2012 UTC,"They won't vilify them.  There will be conflict in the beginning, sure, but I would bet that the villain of the story is some barbarian group or something, that the Marines and the Romans have to work together against to stop.  They'll start off enemies, fight a bit, then realize that they share a lot of things in common, and suddenly a new threat will rise they have to work together against.  End of the movie, both groups part ways with much manly, honorable chest-clapping and arm-grasping, and the Americans either go home or settle down, depending on what route the producers/directors plan on taking."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,kithkatul,7,Mon May 28 06:21:43 2012 UTC,So they'll vilify the Gauls?  But i like the Gauls :C

RomeSweetRome,u86ii,dejust,17,Tue Jul 3 11:25:52 2012 UTC,"It'll be easy. They'll portray Emperor Augustus not as he was in real life, the curator of the princeps mentality but some ruthless and maniacal dictator. Because, y'know, that sort of thing could never ever happen here.  Right?"
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,tomsaz,5,Mon May 28 03:37:06 2012 UTC,"While Augustus was overall probably a good thing for the Empire in terms of shit he got done as emperor, and he was pretty damn far from Caligula...he was far from innocent.  He did have innocent people assassinated (for one of many examples, Caesarion), he did wage frivolous, personal-ambition-driven wars (such as his war with Antony, which he did to establish himself as the sole ruler of Roman provinces), censored history (he purged all mentions of Antony from the historical record) and the fact that he established the position of princeps (or whatever you want to call it) and made it hereditary.    Don't get me wrong...I would be pissed off if they portrayed him like he's Caligula and completely miss out on the moral ambiguity of his character.  But he was far from perfect."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,sje46,6,Fri Jun 1 11:19:41 2012 UTC,"You're right, 100% accurate. My point was that compared to later Emperors such as you mentioned with Caligula or Elagabalus, Nero, and Commodus- Augustus was a pretty good guy. A certain level of moral ambiguity seems to be a requirement for an Emperor. Even the finest of emperors to include Trajan, Hadrian, Claudius, and Diocletian had enough of their own controversies."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,tomsaz,10,Fri Jun 1 17:06:18 2012 UTC,Slavery. Including a scene where a black Marine (probably an officer) acts with disgust when served by a slave during negotiations or something.
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,the_raptor,11,Mon May 28 07:46:49 2012 UTC,"I felt the same way about the Capitol in the Hunger Games, but it seems that no one noticed/cared the the US is basically the Capitol."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,brandnew87,15,Mon May 28 03:30:01 2012 UTC,The Capital is the U.S. government crossed with the American Idol audience.
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,thepodgod,9,Mon May 28 04:39:43 2012 UTC,Panem was every PR dude's wet dream in that movie; you have a state-sponsored murderball happening every year and the only protesting anyone did happened in the state-run concentration camp. That would make making your average politician look good the easiest job in that world...
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,darklooshkin,4,Mon May 28 06:56:33 2012 UTC,I loved how their plan to prevent a violent uprising was to keep the population constantly on the verge of a violent uprising. (I don't know if they ended up justifying it slightly better in the movie than in the books.)
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,Cr4ke,2,Sun Jul 15 17:53:09 2012 UTC,The voters of the US govt. IS the American Idol audience.
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,thepodgod,3,Mon May 28 11:04:02 2012 UTC,I'm siding with Huxley as well as Marcuse and the Frankfort School on this one. American Idol is currently the cultural distraction from the political as such.
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,DAVYWAVY,2,Mon May 28 14:40:54 2012 UTC,"The voters for every governemnt of every country are at least partly made up by viewers of (insert countryname here) idol/next whatever/got talent/ Jersy shore/Oh oh Cherso, they are a world-wide part of the demographic."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,darklooshkin,4,Mon May 28 19:47:38 2012 UTC,"There wont be any vilification.  And there is nothing in prufrocks story that indicates there will be, of either side. To think there would be is to seriously underestimate his writing skills."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,endercoaster,5,Mon May 28 18:45:50 2012 UTC,"What will be more interesting is to see how the US forces will cope once fuel and electricity run dry. Will they resort to slavery? Will they try and set up a primitive oil extraction industry? Will they take over Rome? Can they take over Rome?  Of course the Romans will be vilified, given that the good & evil shtick makes for drama and such while grey on grey makes for confused audiences. But what will be interesting is to see how the Americans are portrayed as their tech level slowly goes from helicopters and tanks to guns and horses. Will the vilification shift if Marines take slaves as cheap labour? What will happen if the Americans are forced to police & administer Rome? If they take over the Empire, how will they be portrayed when they fail to change things for the better and their children take the reins of power, awash with tales & American values and surrounded by relics that made the crossing with their parents?  Bear in mind that these guys aren't scientists or engineers, exactly; very, very few of them would have the training or know-how to set up a functioning factory, electrical generator, oil rig, open-cast mine etc with modern tools, let alone with the trifecta of hammer, chisel and surplus humans they are likely to have on hand.   That, and unless they somehow brought a scientific and technical library's worth of reference books with them, they won't be able to spread the little knowledge they do have.  Few options would be available for maintaining their machines for long and none of those options are likely to be good ones. So what will they do? This is where the real moral dilemma will come from."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,darklooshkin,9,Mon May 28 07:11:18 2012 UTC,I hate that the movie is going to remove all this nuance that would have gotten into the story if Prufrok had kept writing...
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,darklooshkin,4,Mon May 28 15:15:16 2012 UTC,"Nothing says that we can't keep on writing it bub. After all, that's what fanfiction is for..."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,Enleat,6,Mon May 28 15:33:59 2012 UTC,I hope he publishes the novelization.
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,sje46,6,Mon May 28 15:54:31 2012 UTC,"He probably will. I mean, who better to write the book than the guy that wrote the script?   Even if he just came up with a detailed outline that's slightly more fleshed out than the script, all you have to do then is get a bunch of history buffs together and make it a joint project; one team does the research, another translates the results into probable overall behaviour on both sides and either a team of writers or Prufrock + editor go in and turn it into the final product."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,Enleat,4,Mon May 28 16:04:50 2012 UTC,"Of course the Romans will be vilified, given that the good & evil shtick makes for drama and such while grey on grey makes for confused audiences.   While true for some, i doubt all movie-goers are blubbering simpletons. They can understand gray moral areas.  This is sort of the fault of movie producers and shit directors who see that the big money is in simple, stupid summer blockbusters, which is a great shame. It sucks the creativity out and clogs the movie theatres with shit, leaving no room for actualy, quality movies."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,sje46,3,Fri Jun 1 20:08:10 2012 UTC,"While true for some, i doubt all movie-goers are blubbering simpletons. They can understand gray moral areas.   This is, actually, relatively true.  The thing that most people don't realize is that blockbusters aren't just for Americans.  They're for worldwide audiences.  The reason why movies like Transformers perform so well isn't because ""Americans are so stupid and easily entertained"".  It's because the world is so easily entertained, and when you make complex dialogue into the story that deals with gray moral areas...international audiences, who may not know English nor American mores that well--will get confused and won't like the movie as much."
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,Enleat,1 point,Wed Jun 6 15:50:40 2012 UTC,"Oh i wasn't generalizing against Americans at all, i just wanted to say that deeper and more complex movies get remembered and reveered, so there has to be a large number of cultured people who enjoy actual effort, rather than the tits and explosions that Michael Bay showers us with.  However, it is the sad truth that people would rather watch Battleship over 2001:A Space Oddysey, or Blade Runner :("
RomeSweetRome,u86ii,Trollzilla69,3,Wed Jun 6 18:05:00 2012 UTC,"2001 was actually a box office hit.  It made 190 million on a 10 million budget...in 1968.  Multiply that by 6 to get that in today's dollars, and consider the fact that going to the movies was less of a big deal in the 60s, and American movies weren't as international.  All considering, 2001 was huge.    Battleship was a box office success, but actually faired very poorly in the US.  Again, it's the international market, man."
RomeSweetRome,tj4k6,scientologist2,9,Sat May 12 02:16:06 2012 UTC,"To put this in perspective, a single denarius was about the daily wages of an unskilled laborer in the early Roman Empire. If you use that as a guide, and consider unskilled labor's wages today, one could say a single denarius is worth about $40-50.   However if you go by sheer purchasing power at the time, most historians agree that one denarius was worth about $20 of contemporary bread."
