Gamebundles,3e383d,Basicball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware mobile bundles were allowed in this particular sub, but I don't mind it if they are."
Gamebundles,3e383d,flowgurt,4,Tue Jul 21 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"I think they are, it doesn't say pc gamebundles, after all :)"
Gamebundles,3e383d,dougmc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:15 2015 UTC,"Right or wrong, /r/gamedeals doesn't allow mobile posts any more, which is probably what you're thinking of -- but this isn't /r/gamedeals ..."
Gamebundles,3e383d,flowgurt,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just hadn't seen mobile bundles posted here recently either. Which I suppose could also be because there haven't been too many mobile bundles going on that I know of."
Gamebundles,3e383d,cycophuk,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:32:27 2015 UTC,"Oh god, why doesn't this come with Steam keys?  What an awesome bundle."
Gamebundles,3e383d,dougmc,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:37:06 2015 UTC,First humble bundle mobile bundle that I recall with a $1 minimum ...
Gamebundles,3dybgs,jaymondc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"Is this game worth it? I like strategy games, I liked a lot CivV.  I did not try europa universallis, reviews said it is complicated and did not want to try it. what about HoI?"
Gamebundles,3dybgs,tech_engineer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:46:11 2015 UTC,Very complicated. It has the reputation of being the most detailed WW2 game/simulator around for a reason. Approach this being prepared to go in the deep end with no hand holding.
Gamebundles,3dst1t,jaymondc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:53:44 2015 UTC,Lilly and Sasha again... Is this normal?
Gamebundles,3dst1t,AwesomeYears,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:34 2015 UTC,There are three Lilly and Sasha games.  Are you specifically talking about Guardian Angels?
Gamebundles,3dq6l5,NippleThief,6,Sat Jul 18 11:03:17 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool, thanks for sharing!"
Gamebundles,3dq6l5,mart3h,3,Sat Jul 18 15:02:46 2015 UTC,"To me, Bundle Stars is like the ""shotgun"" method of bundles. They do tons and tons of bundles and some of it just sticks (and does really well).  Its not a criticism at all, in fact its nice to know that going to Bundle Stars will frequently mean seeing new content.  I hope they keep up the good work. I like their promotional team."
Gamebundles,3dq6l5,Darkersun,3,Sat Jul 18 19:00:54 2015 UTC,"That's kind of how i view it. Plus, the price is occasionally insane, they sometimes get really good games in their bundles, and there's always lots of games per bundle. Absolutely perfect for gift-giving"
Gamebundles,3dq6l5,dethb0y,3,Sat Jul 18 23:52:51 2015 UTC,"That's why I like them better than most bundle sites.  I'm willing to pay a slightly higher price for bundles that aren't filled with garbage, and Bundlestars tends to have more of those good ones."
Gamebundles,3dq6l5,imunfair,-1,Sun Jul 19 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"what a bunch of noobz :P  Still, I love them and their bundles <3"
Gamebundles,3dp3nn,jaymondc,5,Sat Jul 18 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"These games are on the older side, but they're a ton of fun and have a ton of content each. If you own none or rven just a few of these and like massive real time strategy games, this is a fantastic bundle."
Gamebundles,3dnw6v,Trislar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:18:36 2015 UTC,I'm running a survey on how following Groupees pre-order/full-game-listing posts should be handled.   Please vote and/or write your opinion over here.
Gamebundles,3dnw6v,Torchiest,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:19:40 2015 UTC,How does this work? I've never heard of Groupees before. Do you get a better deal if you do a blind pre-order?
Gamebundles,3dnw6v,APerfectCircle0,4,Sat Jul 18 00:30:10 2015 UTC,Yes it will be cheaper if you do a blind pre-order
Gamebundles,3dnw6v,Obamunism,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a 50% discount."
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Basicball,4,Thu Jul 16 19:42:01 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping to like this one, but I already have Guns of Icarus, and AR-K's art design does absolutely nothing for me. Too bad."
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Torchiest,3,Fri Jul 17 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"I got AR-K in another bundle and was mildly interested, despite sharing your dislike for the art style. I figured I'd get over it, and I probably would have, but what put me off even more was the everything else. Voice acting, dialogue, animation and story (as much of it as I witnessed at least) was pretty bad, and I put it down after less than an hour. I hate skewering Indie games like this, but I gotta say, if AR-K makes or breaks this bundle, then give it a miss."
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Morrinn3,3,Fri Jul 17 12:07:48 2015 UTC,Is it worth it to get any tier but the first? I'm thinking about picking it up for Guns of Icarus but none of the other seem too interesting.
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Rizuko,2,Fri Jul 17 06:28:47 2015 UTC,"Among the sleep is good if you're into horror/walking sim. It's got an amusingly original premise with a great concept for the unreliable narrator (you play as a toddler, so who knows if what you're seeing is real or just your imagination.)       Of the other three games in the upper tiers I only know Warmachine: Tactics. I understand it's fun, but I got that idea from a friend who already plays the miniature game, so his opinion may be a bit biased. I don't know if it's 12 bucks worth, but it's the only game I haven't played in the bundle I'm interested in."
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Morrinn3,3,Fri Jul 17 12:17:10 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for the help! I think I'm going to stick with the first tier as I have never really  been able to get into horror games.
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Rizuko,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:15 2015 UTC,The first Tier is definitely the best value.
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Obamunism,2,Sat Jul 18 01:06:07 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to try Among the Sleep for a while now.
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Tebeku,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"I found the premise highly amusing and it does have some rather tense moments. The sound design is amazingly haunting. The game does have some flaws, but for an indie horror you can do a lot worse than this."

Gamebundles,3djhdf,FungalCactus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"Been wanting to try Full Bore for a while, so seems good to me."
Gamebundles,3djhdf,Incubuslacker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"Guns of Icarus is pretty much the only one worth it (to me). AR-K has been in bundles before as well, but the art/voice/unskippable dialogue isn't my cup of tea."
Gamebundles,3djog1,Minhs2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:58 2015 UTC,"Dont buy it just because of Impossible game. I got it and it has a lot of bugs. Yes, it is awesome game, but not for PC. Android version is great but version ported to PC has no music-sync, the game laggs itself even when playing on better computer, game minimize if you keep playing it nonstop or longer (i dont know, some thing happens on Geometry Dash game -> yyou can see mouse cursor during the game, PC version)."

Gamebundles,3dhhpy,Trislar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:53:07 2015 UTC,"Dollar Days:   If you have already purchased the higher tier bundle, including during presale, you can now purchase or gift additional copies of the full bundle for $1.

Gamebundles,3cvk1b,Obamunism,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"Note: There is a limited number of this bundle available.  A bit more than 2,400 left right now."
Gamebundles,3cqtmr,Basicball,4,Fri Jul 10 01:07:02 2015 UTC,These bundles with a lot of games / Games that have very long titles really are a pain in the ass to post with 300 char title limit... especially if they have both.
Gamebundles,3cqtmr,Gramatike,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:11:32 2015 UTC,If I buy this bundle now do I get the secret game when it comes out or should I wait until its revealed?

Gamebundles,3cqtmr,Torchiest,2,Fri Jul 10 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, and I just bought the bundle now."
Gamebundles,3cqtmr,Obamunism,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:27:18 2015 UTC,One other point: you can upgrade your tier later on if initially you purchase a lower tier.
