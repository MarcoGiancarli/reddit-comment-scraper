cowboybebop,3dvmpb,kaveds,15,Sun Jul 19 22:18:34 2015 UTC,I think he could still play the part because he doesn't age.
cowboybebop,3dvmpb,Komacho,5,Sun Jul 19 23:00:17 2015 UTC,"I've said it once and I will say it again, he could still play and would be a fantastic Vicious."
cowboybebop,3dvmpb,solidsnake32,9,Mon Jul 20 04:48:52 2015 UTC,"IMO, no one can do it, but especially not Keanu. He's great, and John Wick was great, but he's one of those actors who is always himself, like Clooney, Morgan Freeman, Alec Baldwin, Robin Williams, etc. The role of Spike is really subtle, really demanding, you can't have your actual real-life habits and idiosyncracies tainting the character. You'd need some kind of chameleon actor, on the order of like, Gary Oldman, and even then I'm pretty sure it can't be done."
cowboybebop,3dvmpb,TheVegetaMonologues,4,Mon Jul 20 00:02:05 2015 UTC,I agree. I feel like it'd have to be a completely unknown actor too. Someone the world has never seen grace the screens.
cowboybebop,3dvmpb,Piku_Chan,2,Mon Jul 20 01:11:34 2015 UTC,"I personally suspect that movie and his part in it were a love letter to Cowboy Bebop.   Damaged once dark but now somewhat redeemed man goes back into action and is dragged back into dealing with his twisted history? He left because of a woman? Has no emotional connection to the world except for the ones he makes to humanize himself? But not fully willingly?  And those amazing combat scenes?   Man, that was Keanu playing out his love for what would have been an amazing role and amazing character."
cowboybebop,3dvmpb,GetMeOffReddit,3,Mon Jul 20 05:56:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I could see Keanu learning the water style of hand to hand combat

cowboybebop,3dvmpb,rdxj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:27:24 2015 UTC,80's/90's Keanu would have been perfect.
cowboybebop,3dvmpb,kvlasco,2,Mon Jul 20 01:42:54 2015 UTC,I think maybe 90s vintage Takeshi Kaneshiro would be the way to go. But that would have to be for a Japanese adaptation.
cowboybebop,3dvmpb,infantile_leftist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:48:04 2015 UTC,"I was actually just thinking the same thing the other day about the similarities in plots between the two, especially in terms of both Wick and Spike being bounty hunters of sorts, and the whole woolongs vs gold coins currency as the ultimate reward."

cowboybebop,3dqwcj,ArmadonRK,3,Sat Jul 18 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Well, it's better, but still has pretty heavy jpeg artifacts. Is there a lossless version that can be hosted, imgur or elsewhere?"
cowboybebop,3dqwcj,zopiac,7,Sat Jul 18 21:37:16 2015 UTC,You just resized it and now it's blurry. I don't think you understand how resolution works.

cowboybebop,3dqwcj,PayisInc,8,Sat Jul 18 17:12:53 2015 UTC,Okay.
cowboybebop,3dqwcj,temporarycreature,2,Sat Jul 18 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"There's definitely some JPG compression at work here, the source images in the other thread are higher quality than this image as uploaded."
cowboybebop,3dqwcj,ArmadonRK,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:50:18 2015 UTC,"That's because he just resized the image, and then resaved it with a higher compression rate than the original was saved at. The more you save a JPEG, the worse it looks. I wonder why they never made it so the compression rules for a new save replaces the old rules instead of just stacking up until it looks like someone vomited on the JPEG."
cowboybebop,3dqwcj,temporarycreature,3,Sat Jul 18 18:54:10 2015 UTC,"Alternatively the compression is on imgur's end, because I just tried recreating this collage using the images from the other thread and uploading it to imgur uncompressed, only to get the same artifacting on the uploaded image."
cowboybebop,3dqwcj,ArmadonRK,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:56:11 2015 UTC,"Regardless, OP doesn't understand resolution if he thinks changing the size of the image is the same as increasing resolution. I know video can upscale, but I am not positive that the same can be done with images since they're not made to be scalable. As far as I know, you can go down in resolution, but never up due to there not being enough data, pixels, etc to do so."
cowboybebop,3dqwcj,temporarycreature,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"Actually I grabbed the individual images posted in this comment and stitched them together to form an image with a better resolution than the previous one. You're right though. It still has issues, it's just the best I could do.  I also did not know that imgur compresses images when you upload them anonymously. The top comment in this thread has rehosted the image on their part and the resolution looks better there."

I mean, that's a lot of freaking episode, the 3 shooting star book just contains like 5-5-5 episode.   There's only 5 manga and both start with Jet & Spike already together.   Shooting Star has them meeting Ed, Ein & Faye, but it's completely different from how they met on the TV show. And there's only 2 Shooting Star books, and the 1st book is mostly introduction & setup.   The other one, just called Cowboy Bebop, is 3 books but only like 11 chapters. It starts with the whole crew together."

cowboybebop,3do1fq,30cuts,2,Sun Jul 19 07:20:14 2015 UTC,"There were 2 novels published only in Japan. According to Jazzmess.com one is about Ed's origin and the other takes place after Faye & Ein are already on board.   There was also a novelization of the movie, and and a couple of behind the scenes type books.  As for the Japanese blu-ray, as far as I know the books that came with it are just art books, but I've only seen pictures, so I can't confirm."

An error would have been corrected a long time ago.  Besides, if you go to amazon.jp and google translate the description of the book with just Spike and Jet on the cover, the translation isn't great, but it is clear that it's about Ed's orgins.   The other one has EVERYBODY on the cover, making it unlikely it's just about Jet & Spike. And this ebay auction shows Faye & Ein in the book: http://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-NOVEL-Cowboy-Bebop-Wild-Man-Blues-Michiko-Yokote-OOP-/301571598061  I believe it's a story that takes place after Faye joins, but before Ed joins.

He goes on to say that Spike's star is going to fall.  Then, when Spike is bleeding out right before the credits, we see a star in the sky wink out of existence.  The correlation of the symbolism seems pretty strong to me."

But when Ed and Ein leaves, well, their star also falls. So its not about dying. Its maybe about fullfilling their quest. Glen died in peace, and Ed found her way. But Spike's star just vanished. Maybe because he failed his quest? Or the star what we can see when Ed and Ein leaves is rather a meteorite, implying that she is going to that way, because she will find her father there? OH CRAP, I need to watch these episodes tonight. Again. And then once more. Maybe. For sure."
cowboybebop,3ddotw,hotLikeSausage,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:48 2015 UTC,It could be because Spike fulfilled his quest of reuniting with Julia and killing Vicious. He had nothing else to do and he was done. At least that's my take on it
cowboybebop,3ddotw,zacharyxbinks,5,Tue Jul 21 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"You can choose to interpret any show any way you want, but to me, it's a much better ending if he dies.   All of the lines like ""I'm not going there to die, I'm going there to find out if I'm really alive"" and the fact that Julia was all he had to live for and Vicious was the only one who could kill him would be rather pointless if he lived. Everyone has to die, I'm sure spike would have rather gone out like that than die an old man in bed."
cowboybebop,3ddotw,Mekbop,3,Wed Jul 15 17:32:37 2015 UTC,He died once before....
cowboybebop,3ddotw,Symbi0tic,3,Wed Jul 15 18:29:31 2015 UTC,Spike is dead.   In episode 6(I think it was 6) the guy who couldn't age was telling Spike that he knows it feels like to die. And Spike said something along the lines of 'Hell if I know' or something along those lines. And then he did the 'Bang' thing in the sky.  I think the reason he did the 'Bang' thing in the final episode was because he finally found out what it was like to die.  All my opinion of course.
cowboybebop,3ddotw,Mekbop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"Not just an opinion, though..pretty much the only logical explanation."
cowboybebop,3ddotw,Symbi0tic,2,Tue Jul 21 01:22:46 2015 UTC,Tbh I don't know why people want him to stay alive. If he died there and then it would be the perfect closure for the anime imo.

cowboybebop,3da39d,LGarrad,41,Tue Jul 14 18:00:17 2015 UTC,I love it. Have you tried rewatching the series and inserting the movie chronologically? It takes place between sessions 22 and 23 if I remember correctly but the truth is somewhere in this sub.

cowboybebop,3da39d,ShadowKing94,5,Tue Jul 14 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. I treat it like a really long episode. This is the way I always watch it. It's actually well placed because it's really the last time we have fun with the crew.  I don't like my trip on the Bebop ending happily. This story ends with You're Gonna Carry that Weight, as it's supposed to."

cowboybebop,3da39d,colgato,12,Tue Jul 14 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"The thing about the Cowboy Bebop movie is that it doesn't feel like they were trying to make a movie, if that makes sense. It just feels like any other episode of the show, with the only exception being that it's much longer.   Because of this I feel like I enjoyed the Bebop movie much more than most other movies made out of popular anime series. It was a great movie that was able to keep the 100% of the charm of the original show."
cowboybebop,3da39d,chewysteve,21,Tue Jul 14 22:10:35 2015 UTC,I was disappointed when it ended.
cowboybebop,3da39d,lovemyMFLB,8,Tue Jul 14 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"It felt like a slightly longer episode. Nothing that wasn't more amazing than the rest of the series. I'm glad it happened and brought more great music to the mix. But, I agree that it wasn't what it could have been."
cowboybebop,3da39d,Cool11989,7,Tue Jul 14 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the movie!  It is better than most episodes, imho.

cowboybebop,3da39d,ShadowKing94,2,Tue Jul 14 22:26:52 2015 UTC,People are always surprised when I claim Black Dog Serenade as my favorite one-off episode. It's just perfect to me.

cowboybebop,3da39d,stackshot,7,Wed Jul 15 23:10:26 2015 UTC,"No. It's amazing and I love every second of it.   I wasn't looking for some sort of end-all be-all, ""this one's for all the marbles"" like a lot of people were though. It was just like an episode of bebop lengthened to feature film length, and given the corresponding depth and nuance, which is more than enough for me.   It has great action, great music, a great sort of film-noir plot, a great villain (someone here said he's not characterized distinctly enough and I disagree entirely), and it does a great job of expressing some big and powerful ideas without going up it's own ass.   Also, if you watch it in its chronological place in the series, it does a great job of preparing you for the massive tone-shift that occurs with Spike in the final few episodes."
cowboybebop,3da39d,TheVegetaMonologues,6,Tue Jul 14 21:02:02 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was good but not very memorable in my opinion..

However, that can be said for any artwork if you listen to a lot of people's thoughts and reviews.    If you have the time and interest, a movie podcast covered this back in 2008:  http://media.libsyn.com/media/gooberzilla/bebop100208.mp3  Visually it was far better than the series, yet the movie definitely had more money and time to focus on the artwork and visuals."
cowboybebop,3da39d,MisterRoku,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"The animation in the movie was out standing. I'm not saying the show had bad animation at all either, it's probably one of the best animated shows ever. But the movie had incredible scenes, like Spike fighting while using the broom, and an outstanding feeling of the city being alive.   I've only gotten a similar sense of scale in terms of a city from movies set in New York. Leon the Professional comes is one of the first to jump out."

cowboybebop,3da39d,hairypolack,4,Wed Jul 15 12:22:23 2015 UTC,"The villain is simply a Vicious retread, and suffers from Vicious' main issue: not enough definitive characterization.

cowboybebop,3da39d,CorpDelta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that ultimately the actions/consequences of the film don't have any impact on the overarching plot of the series. It just feels like a 120 minute session between sessions 22 and 23. I recall watching the movie immediately after finishing the series. All I wanted was some acknowledgement of the ultimate fates that would befall our beloved bebop crew. But there's nothing; the movie recalls absolutely nothing from any other other session.  There are no winks or nods to the audience.  I just wanted something, something that said, ""Hey, enjoy this now because you know what's coming.""  The closest we as the audience get is Spike's dream, which is fun because it reintroduces Laughing Bull and is followed by a sincere moment between Spike and Jet. This is by far my favorite sequence of the film."

It isn't the worst anime movie I've seen, and you really can't go wrong with a little more bebop."
cowboybebop,3d6m66,Bobeez,3,Mon Jul 13 22:50:07 2015 UTC,Is this the definitive set to own? I don't want to buy it if there is a better version out there.
cowboybebop,3d6m66,temporarycreature,4,Tue Jul 14 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"no, there is debate between BR and the original. there is lot of weirdness in the editing for the newer ones like unnecessary sounds being added certain scenes having the color and contrasted edited so much it changes the mood. In a way it's like how lucas edited starwars too much but, not that bad. i wish i had link to side by side comparison. TBH it's probably best to have a HQ rip of the original and the BR version then you have both."
cowboybebop,3d6m66,cdoublejj,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me I'd rather the original, to create an anime with such great detail there would have to be a lot of thought and reasoning put into every element of each scene. It's not like a film where somethings are just there, everything has to be drawn. With that reasoning I think any edits, although they wouldn't happenly lightly really shouldn't be made unless there is an extremely good reason. But then again I could be almost completely wrong."
cowboybebop,3d6m66,N1cko1138,3,Tue Jul 14 05:41:48 2015 UTC,"Just to give the opposing viewpoint, to most, the differences between versions will go unnoticed, and some who feel like many of the changes are an improvement, such as the sound effect and music changes. I'll just quote my last post on the topic:  ""As for the version the creator intended, that's a tougher question, I think, than just the original release. Director's Cuts, Extended Cuts, George Lucas Cuts; more often than not, you can really only choose the cut you feel best represents the work.  Not having seen the entire series as originally broadcast (the Perfect Sessions) I can't say for sure which is the better representation. The Remix was marketed as remastered ""under Watanabe's supervision"", though who can say whether or not that's accurate? For me, it's things like the change of music in the final episode preview that make me consider that the changes were made with careful consideration. Though the argument could be made that the new track doesn't fit the mood, I've always argued that Farewell Blues, being closely tied to Jet and his resolved arc, was a thematically dissonant chose of score. The replacement, however, ties it into Jupiter Jazz's themes, and Spike's arc more honestly, and the rhythmic, bass-driven tune suits the almost beat-poem style voice-over much better.  Not to say that it makes it the superior version, just a personal preference in terms of tone and thematic continuity. There's merit in considering the original to be truer to the original vision, as well. I suppose what I'm saying is, I don't know that there is a definitive version of Cowboy Bebop. Pursue and prefer the one you think is best.""  Let's just say I disagree with the Lucas comparison. Yes, there are changes made, and I understand if people prefer the original version, but it isn't anywhere near as radical as what George Lucas did to Star Wars. In fact, many HD remasters undergo many more and more radical changes than Bebop."

cowboybebop,3d7usi,LGarrad,3,Wed Jul 15 19:05:45 2015 UTC,This isn't a book or anime but it did fill my need for something like Bebop. Everyone probably seen this but watch a TV series called Firefly. It's a space western like Bebop and has a slightly similar protagonist and when it comes to emotions... It has the Bebop feel. There is a TV series then a film which finishes it all.  (Your English is better than most native speakers)

cowboybebop,3d7jsc,Spacegaterambler,3,Tue Jul 14 03:16:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think they can make it work.  no doubt they could make a good script, and have awesome special effects, and an insane soundtrack - that's easy.  and addressing your question about how to approach the script - the basics of doing something like this would be that they would mention the odd thing that seems really obvious (to the people that have seen the anime) but helps out the people that havent seen it. Obviously it's not going to be solely made for the fans, it's to make more fans, so they'd have some explanations of maybe what the Bebop is, who the characters are, maybe mention Faye's past or something like that. Then of course there'd be a huge number of little easter eggs that would maybe seem weird to those that havent seen it - and make those that have feel nostalgic.  but they can't make it as cool as Bebop is as an anime.  I say that because Spike, the coolest character in history, is partly cool for a hairstyle that looks great in a cartoon, but really really stupid on a human. and he is also out of proportion - he has unnaturally long legs and almost a swimmer's torso.  Then there's Ed - who is a purely for anime character with her fluid movements and leaping around which would look really, really dumb if a human was doing it.  also, i think the space-dogfights would most likely be a load of green screen crap that wouldn't look all that engaging.  I don't like the idea of a live action because they'd have to make it way more realistic and detract from all the extra little aspects that made the anime so good."
cowboybebop,3d7jsc,chubbyurma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are completely right! The characters... they are too anime-ish, even if it sounds like I'm an idiot. Their face, body, etc. is perfect, they dont even have scars or something like that. Like 4 model. They require the perfect actor... just imagine how frustrating is, to find the perfect actress for Ed for example... short, very skinny, very-very athletic, needs a lot of hair for that hairstyle, and yes, she also need a flat chest and last but not least, a perfect face shape.  That's impossible.  So I think it would be better to do maybe 5 new episode. Or a big movie, but in cartoon style. About what happened after the show. Maybe the characters would met again, or we could watch them how they live their lives separated. It would be great, because there is a lot of question: Is Faye and Jet still hunts together? Or they parted their ways? Or maybe Jet died since the show? What about Ed? How does she look like now? What is she doing? And Ein?  That would be sooo lovely if we could see them meet together. I would definietly cry like a baby. Twice."

cowboybebop,3cyffu,Piku_Chan,3,Sun Jul 12 12:28:30 2015 UTC,"As a matter of fact, it's hard to sound like Bebop. I've only ever came across one or two saxophonists who can play in a style similar to the way Masato Honda or Jan Garbarek of the Bebop OST crew play.   And it's this guy, Adrián Terrazas-González. Link  Keeping in mind that he has his own little nuances as well.   Masato Honda barely ever plays the way he did on the Bebop OST in his actual solo work, nor Jan Garbarek. However, it's very surprising to see Jan Garbarek's career, and it's even more surprising that he even played a role in the creation of the Bebop OST considering Jan Garbarek is truly a legend amongst the jazz community globally, not just some unknown artist who worked on the Bebop OST."

And more importantly, no brass instruments. What about this is Bebop? None of it sounds like Bebop, not even slightly. It's a completely different style.   It's a drumkit, a guitar, bass, and vocals.  Bebop is much more.   I'm not knocking the band by the way, they remind me of the band Jet (Are You Gonna Be My Girl) and Red Hot Chilli Peppers, if they had a baby. Quite a big fan of that Gunpowder Blues track."

cowboybebop,3cq61j,megamullet286,12,Thu Jul 9 21:55:41 2015 UTC,"She is my favourite character. Its really annoying that we dont know where she went at the end... Is she went back to her father? But he dont really cared about her... Or went back to the orphanage? Or maybe just continued her nomadic lifestyle on the Earth? I dont know... The show about her is a fantastic idea, although I think she is more like the hacker type, not the gunslinger bounty hunter like Faye. Someone in my country wrote a fanfiction about her, and she had her own little comfy electrical device repair shop in it, thats also a pretty cute idea :)  At around 18, I can only imagine her like this :)"

cowboybebop,3cmozw,chubbyurma,6,Thu Jul 9 03:24:32 2015 UTC,"My theory is this. Everyone gets bitten and comes down with the sickness, but before Spike loads up on weapons and hunts the thing down, he sets the ship to automatically land on Mars (I think). One could assume that once they land, they find Ed asleep and the rest of the crew unconscious. Everyone gets resuscitated and off they go to the Jupiter Jazz sessions."
cowboybebop,3cmozw,TheBlueRaccoon,2,Thu Jul 9 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that's the best theory I've heard so far. It seemed like a pretty big plot whole to just have them miraculously heal when they made such a big deal about the severity of the poison/infection/bacteria."

cowboybebop,3cmozw,Citrus_supra,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:51:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's what it was, and was a satire episode, not sure to what exactly, but it just gave room for the public to get to know more of the personalities of the crew (No lighter?.... got a torch though...)."
cowboybebop,3cmozw,Thulox,2,Thu Jul 9 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"Spike set the autopilot to Mars before he got bitten. And Ed didn't got sick because... well, because she is Ed. She and Ein simbolizes the purity, the fun and the innocence in the show. Negative things don't really affect her, luckily."
cowboybebop,3cmozw,Symbi0tic,2,Thu Jul 9 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're the only one that's posted the correct answer so far. They didn't show Spike programming the ship for Mars for no reason.  And Ed ate the blob, she didn't get bitten by it. A little different?..Maybe."
cowboybebop,3cmozw,SonicGamer74,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"It's just a joke episode, that (IIRC) pays homage to the movie, ""Alien"".  This is actually an extremely memorable episode, tbh."
cowboybebop,3cmozw,marshall_banana_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:18:02 2015 UTC,They don't. This is the end of the series. Everything afterwards is Spike's last dream before dying.  Why else do you think the episode ends with this?

You get to know her character much better. I always wondered how she survived on her own after she left the orphanage, but this episode gave me the answer :D  And also, soon you reach the end of the series. There's going to be a lot of surprise, the last 5 episode is an emotional rollercoaster. Who is your favourite character? :)"
cowboybebop,3cjlic,Thulox,2,Thu Jul 16 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Well after finishing it i have to say it's probably the best anime I've ever seen. I actually like the fact that it's short because pretty much every episode is masterfully done (I thought 21-Feng Shui) was pretty fillery.  The ending has gutted me honestly, because of how my favorite character Jet has been consistently hurt over the course of the show even though he tries to do everything the right and honorable way.  I would go so far as to say i now have a love-hate relationship with this show because of how little closure it gave me, i think i am going to hold off on the movie until a rainy day a few years into the future when the thought of cowboy bebop creeps back into my mind and i'll remember that i have saved this last bite of glory for later.  My favorite scene was from Session-10 Ganymede Elegy when Jet tells Spike to go back to the ship and this song starts playing and my Favorite episode is a toss up between Mushroom Samba and Cowboy Funk.  Well that is pretty much my whole review of it, Am i a space cowboy now? :D"
cowboybebop,3cjlic,Thulox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it, welcome onboard :D Its brilliant how the mood changes constantly, the show really plays with your feelings. And the music is also brilliant. I only cried in the Walking Dead video game years ago, but the ending, or when Ed leaves... cracked me up very badly.   It's surprising that Jet gutted you the mostly, I think his ending ist the happiest, or I dont know. I mean, Spike dies, Faye is keep struggling with her past, and Ed just leaves, we really don't know where she goes, there are just speculations... But Jet, well, he gets over his past, and stays alive, although he is the oldest from the 4 protagonist. I kinda expected him to die, I don't know why, just had the feeling."
cowboybebop,3cjlic,woodstock219,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if you think about it everything he ever tries to love is destroyed or leaves him. His wife, his ship, his new family. A lot of characters ( e.g. faye) say that everyone that gets close to them dies, but in reality it is only true with Jet.   (I thought it was pretty obvious that faye wasn't sticking around in the bebop after spike left)"
cowboybebop,3cjlic,disasterpi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, its kinda true. I never thought about it that way, but yes, his story is just as sad as the others. What am I supposed to do with all these feelings :("

Bebop,Trigun, And Dai-Guard set the stage for the future of Anime man. The animation and story Arcs where so well done,Like nothing anyone had seen at the time.

Not quite the same, but released the same year so there are some quality similarities and it is somewhat of a ""space western.""

I didn't care for the style so i didn't buy it... kinda wish i had now.  They are omake stories, that is, they take place with the entire crew, not within the confines of the series.

""This motely lot of intergalactic loners"" Double nope - they never leave the galaxy, and they make as far as Jupiter (though more further out places are mentioned).  And "" The pilot Jet is a bruiser of a brute who can’t wait to collect the next bounty."". Jet's the owner of the Bebop, not just a pilot.

It's weird that all of these people are praising the quality for being just as good as when originally aired, and then you have evidence showing things were cut and changed. I might just buy this, and then get the original release that way the people who created it at least make something off of their product. Have you tried this release of the blu-ray version?"
cowboybebop,3bst5q,mqrss3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:51:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen bits and pieces of it. I made the mistake of not pre-ordering (I would've liked to have the physical material), but it upsets me that we'll likely never see a proper high definition release of the original series as a result of this release and the remix.  The resolution is definitely an improvement, but I don't like the brightened footage and I wouldn't take any of the changes over the original."

I used to go on the Jazz Messengers website every day a long time ago. The website's curator, a person who referred to themselves simply as Fata Morgana, helped me obtain the MP3s of the two Poor Faye piano tracks. They legitimately crafted who I am as a person. I burned them to CDs and walked out into the woods listening to them as a kid. I felt this profound melancholy while doing so. It was something else, but whatever it was, it has to do with who I am now.  The music of this show. Man."

Up to that point I had really enjoyed the first four episodes of the show, but I didn't quite feel emotionally invested in the characters. Ballad of the Fallen Angels comes in at the perfect point, giving the viewer a little peak further the background of Spike, and shows us that this is no ordinary anime."
cowboybebop,3b9mgx,TomBonner1,8,Sat Jun 27 13:47:09 2015 UTC,Pretty much. The Green Bird scene is still my favorite thing in animation.
cowboybebop,3b9mgx,Xator_Nova,2,Sat Jun 27 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"100% agree.  The Ballad of Fallen Angels is easily my favorite episode in not only any Anime, but also in animation in general."

Grenn's monologue while dying in Spike's arms followed by the old Native American's speech about lost souls, accompanied by the gorgeous soundtrack as the credits start to roll as we pan up across the stars... I was left utterly speechless.   I've only watched through the whole show once so far, but I'd still say the Jupiter Jazz two parter is my favourite episode(s)"
cowboybebop,3b9mgx,I_Am_The_Slime,4,Tue Jun 30 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"Technically, never happened for me, as I still wouldn't call CB my top favourite anime series.  I agree that the fight scene in Asteroid Blues is fantastic, and its music theme (Rush) became my favourite part of the soundtrack. I rather liked the car chase scene with Ein in the second episode (Bad Dog No Biscuit, another great piece of music). Ballad of Fallen Angels is, obviously, incredibly impressive all on its own. The ninth to eleventh episode sequence is probably my favourite part of the series, and even after that some of the episodes helped to redeem Feye's character, whom I didn't like much prior to that.  So all and all, it was a very gradual process, and I think I enjoyed Cowboy Bebop much more when I came around to rewatch it."

This show called ""Cowboy Bebop"" would come on and I'd watch it. Thought it was a weird title. It was anime. The only other anime I had ever seen was for kids. Seemed pretty interesting. Ballad of Fallen Angels was the best TV episode I'd ever seen. The series' music was phenomenal. It caught my heart REALLY quickly.  It broke the mold for anime and forever ruined it for me.

cowboybebop,3aoiul,mexican33,9,Mon Jun 22 05:20:51 2015 UTC,"I second this completely. It's about half the length of Bebop, so it's very short but it's also really great and very well-animated. It can also be pretty emotional. Hell, it can even be relatable in some ways. I think it's the first show where I actually prefer sub over dub, but that could be because I watched the whole show subbed on Crunchyroll. The music is also really awesome, one of my favorite tracks being one called Rosario. Basically, there's a lot of great things about this show and I definitely recommend you check it out. You won't regret it.   FYI, if you do watch the whole series, check out the manga to see an even better ending and better closure to the show and story overall.   I didn't even know there was a subreddit for it, thanks!"
cowboybebop,3aoiul,Cobrarara,3,Mon Jun 22 05:53:39 2015 UTC,I bought the soundtrack as soon as i finished the series. And yeah i forgot to mention the manga which has a better ending imo.

cowboybebop,3aoiul,Acmnin,2,Mon Jun 22 19:39:22 2015 UTC,First show where you prefer sub over dub???? Are you a masochist? Other than Bebop... most Dubs historically have fallen flat...
cowboybebop,3aoiul,deadfenix,3,Mon Jun 22 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of pretty bad or mediocre dubs out there but I have to admit that Bebop caused me to give more respect for dubs. I've since grown a greater respect for a lot of voice actors in the past 13 or so years. Full Metal Alchemist, FMA: Brotherhood, Hellsing are pretty solid dubs.  I grew up watching the sketchy dubbed versions of stuff that aired on Sci-Fi on Saturday mornings so it's possible my bar is set a bit lower than others. I do still think a lot of dubs have improved greatly... just ignore stuff like Naruto or One Piece.   It seems like some of the better dubs are found in more mature material like Ghost in the Shell (tv series), Baccano, Darker than Black, Durarara, Eden of the East, or Steins;Gate.  I will admit, there are certain American VAs that I find their voices to be quite appealing so I do admit a bit of bias on the matter."
cowboybebop,3aoiul,Acmnin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:49:33 2015 UTC,I do enjoy Ghost in the Shell's dub.   Absolutely hate Alphonse' English voice.
cowboybebop,3aoiul,Cobrarara,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd make a reply too, since I just saw this. I do agree with you about Bebop, it's one of the best dubs out there, in my opinion. I also really enjoy FMA's and GitS's dubs too. Although, I also enjoy Naruto's dub and One Piece's Funimation dub, but not that 4kids crap. I grew up watching 4kids dubs, so my bar is set REALLY low. But even if you don't watch Naruto's dub, Steve Blum is still an awesome voice actor in it and other shows like this one, Bebop! I believe all dubs could be really great though, with the right VAs."
cowboybebop,3aoiul,Cobrarara,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:41:23 2015 UTC,"Haha, no. Really, the whole sub vs dub thing is no big deal. Most anime I've watched or grew up watching was in English, so I've always preferred that. Really, I probably would've watched this show in English if I hadn't had jumped on it when I saw it on Crunchyroll, but I did anyway and continued from there. What I'm saying is the only real reason I prefer sub instead of dub to this show is because I watched it all in sub first. That doesn't mean the English dub for this show is bad, I just haven't watched it in English.   Although I do have to agree though, I've heard some pretty cringeworthy dubs before."
cowboybebop,3aoiul,Acmnin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:35:17 2015 UTC,"Not to mention some of the dubs massacred the translations, same for video games.. a la ""All Your Base Are Belong To Us""  I think it was far more common for terrible dubs in past decades when little funding or importance was put on anime by Western Audiences.."
cowboybebop,3aoiul,Cobrarara,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. It makes me wish Funimation could actually go back and redub some of the shows with not-so-great dubs, like they did with One Piece. When I was younger, shows like Zatch Bell!(actually Gash Bell!, which also comes back to what you said about mistranslations) and MAR, in my mind, were good dubs. But when you return to them when you're older, that's when you see how cringeworthy they are. I'm still pissed Zatch Bell's dub didn't get finished, even if it was bad."

cowboybebop,3aoiul,minTeafresh,0,Wed Jun 24 06:53:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. I mean I felt like the English actors sounded cheesy in this anime. Tried both early on but quickly realized the right choice.  Watched that a few months ago but I've become almost only a sub watcher now, the English voices in most shows sound way more emotionless in my opinion."
cowboybebop,3aoiul,Cobrarara,0,Wed Jun 24 06:57:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the English voice actors in this anime made me cringe, which was weird because I'd mostly watched dubs my whole life and never cringed, but something about these voice actors really bothered me, and like I said earlier, it could've been because I watched it subbed first instead of dubbed."
cowboybebop,3aoiul,TheHomesickAlien,4,Wed Jun 24 09:00:22 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing! I would also (but not as strongly) suggest Welcome to the NHK.  Perhaps even Terror in Resonance. Vibessss

A show about loneliness, companionship, sadness, happiness, diversity, importance of family, and exploration of the soul of our civilization - our culture. This song always triggers sadness in me, suddenly throwing me back into vast emotions that I have experienced throughout my life...  ""You're going to carry that weight...""

cowboybebop,3ankp6,Xenuthorzha,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, they definitely did. I've been listening to the soundtracks for years and I just rewatched the show for the 3rd time after quite a few years. I can't help but feel emotional listening to ""Rain"", ""Singing Sea"", ""The Real Folk Blues"", ""Green Bird"", and definitely ""Blue. There so much more beyond that too, just the stuff I could think of right now. ""Memory"" is a very bittersweet song.  Moments like watching Faye watch that beta video of her younger self were difficult to watch. So many really emotional moments nestled in a mix of action and comedy. The music really brought it all together and accentuated it all."

cowboybebop,3aoafl,Masterdoctorn7,2,Wed Jun 24 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"I suppose because they wanted to make the movie of it's own despite being cannon. While a lot of people view it as a 2 hour episode, it stands out on its own. Having it's own intro and ending song helps on cementing it."
cowboybebop,3aoafl,rdxj,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:34:28 2015 UTC,I guess I don't see a need to tip their hat to the fans in that way. The whole movie accomplishes that! They needed something unique to accompany that intro and they nailed it.

cowboybebop,3aepf9,Okarine,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:39:17 2015 UTC,"1st recommendation, buy the OSTs. I initially got sucked into the show but I also ended up getting sucked into the music. I hunted for the music when Spike falls out of the cathedral (""Green Bird"") and I fell in love with the music despite buying every OST but the one I was looking for last.  That said, finish the show first. It has some great moments left for you. After that, well you'll appreciate the music nonetheless even if you haven't already.  I hope you continue to enjoy it. When you're done, well, I can speak more stuff and music and whatnot.  EDIT: The movie is also pretty good. Watch it after the series but it roughly takes place between 22 and 23 (I think). Anyway. Considered it like and after dinner dessert."

cowboybebop,3ab791,MAXMEEKO,3,Thu Jun 18 21:25:14 2015 UTC,Asteroid Blues. You gotta start from the starting point.
cowboybebop,3ab791,Discover_and_Become,3,Thu Jun 18 22:46:44 2015 UTC,number 1 is so good. keep those eyeeeess opeeennn
cowboybebop,3ab791,Discover_and_Become,3,Thu Jun 18 19:21:03 2015 UTC,How did it go?
cowboybebop,3ab791,deadfenix,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"SO - I went with episode one. She adored the soundtrack, and made comparisons between the show and Westerns/ Film Noir crime movies, so... she's up for watching more. Appreciates the art, but maybe not her thing overall. Not the end of the world I suppose!"
cowboybebop,3ab791,TheVegetaMonologues,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:14:24 2015 UTC,Ballad might push her all the way in  Exciting! Sounds like a fun experience
cowboybebop,3ab791,rgba0000ninja,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:50:37 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely try continuing in order. If she seems wavering after the 2nd or 3rd, maybe skip to Ballad. That scene out side of the cathedral while ""Rain"" plays, the ""Green Bird"" scene... If she still doesn't like it, then it might not be for her and probably not best to force it. Pulling farther ahead in the series might not have the same impact as they do for us since we've watched the build-up for such moments."
cowboybebop,3ab791,nicecleatswannaruck,2,Sat Jun 20 03:24:50 2015 UTC,Any answer other than one implies that you somehow know better than the creator what order they should be shown in.
cowboybebop,3ab791,Masterdoctorn7,2,Wed Jun 24 10:15:21 2015 UTC,It's simple: Start at the beginning.
cowboybebop,3ab791,StewartDC8,2,Thu Jun 18 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"The movie would be a good primer, then if she's interested go on to the series in order."
cowboybebop,3ab791,MmmmmKittens,2,Thu Jun 18 21:40:33 2015 UTC,Start it off with the first episode. If she likes it - show the rest hates it? ...show her the Alien like episode Hates that even more? ...damn it..show her the movie :)
cowboybebop,3ab791,daemon_hunter,2,Thu Jun 18 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"Session 1 wouldn't be a bad intro, but I was introduced through Waltz for Venus, and I was hooked. If she doesn't like the magic in that episode she won't like the series at all."
cowboybebop,3ab791,BigPaenix,2,Fri Jun 19 03:09:48 2015 UTC,I started my girlfriend on Mish-Mash Blues (session xx). It does a great job of introducing the characters and the style of the show. I wish more people knew about that session.
cowboybebop,3ab791,SutorenjiKamereon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:27:41 2015 UTC,You should definitely not start at the beginning of the series. Why would she wan't to start with episode one? Start her towards the end so she has no idea what is going on. How about the episode where ed leaves the bebop? That is clearly the best place to start.
cowboybebop,3ab791,Citrus_supra,2,Fri Jun 19 16:43:41 2015 UTC,THE MUSHROOM EPISODE!! But actually start from the beginning I would say.

cowboybebop,3a0rb3,PunchedDrunkLove,9,Tue Jun 16 13:00:22 2015 UTC,I gave the artist a reference image of the Swordfish and requested for him to make a sketchy/hand-drawn version of it. He's pretty good at those kinds of tattoos.  You can check out his work here: http://instagram.com/jared_asalli/

cowboybebop,39uyu0,pawptart,30,Mon Jun 15 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"This is from Gemini Rue, a point-and-click game I picked up during the Steam Summer sale for $2.99.   It's a very good game so far (I've only played maybe 30 minutes of it) with parts that definitely feel a lot like Bebop due to the obvious parallel to Spike's flashbacks to his past. Still, it was a complete surprise to explore the starting area again and see Spike standing there wondering if he's really alive.  EDIT: Apparently the entire main cast makes an appearance in this game but I just haven't found the other three yet. Ed's label when you hover your mouse over her is ""Girl?"""
cowboybebop,39uyu0,Symbi0tic,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"Nice. Thanks for the heads up, I went ahead and picked it up. Not much interest in many games lately but something like this is a little unique.  Edit: Started playing it and within two minutes of the game starting, I checked the inventory of the player and the pistol is described as an ""IMI Jericho 941,"" which is the exact gun Spike uses. Clearly this game was heavily influenced by Bebop."
cowboybebop,39uyu0,Xenguin,6,Wed Jun 17 02:19:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for pointing this game out. Bought it at your recommendation.
cowboybebop,39uyu0,Lowenbroke,2,Mon Jun 15 02:25:47 2015 UTC,I wish we had a real cowboy bebop game that rocked
cowboybebop,39uyu0,Symbi0tic,3,Mon Jun 15 20:40:05 2015 UTC,It's in my future plans to develop a game that takes place in the world of Bebop..or as close to it as I can get without infringing  copyrights.  I'll be sure to let you know when that comes to fruition..some day.

Are you looking for a verbatim transcription of the English dub like this thread from a few days ago? If so, I haven't found any either. I starting working on transcribing and captioning Asteroid Blues, but this thread has prompted me to finish it. I'll message you and make a new thread when I've finished Episode 1.  Again, if anyone knows where to download closed captions for the English dub of Cowboy Bebop, or if any of the physical DVDs or Blu Rays came with them, let me know so I won't waste my time doing another 25 episodes!  EDIT: I've since discovered that the Blu-rays have proper closed captions. They have some syncing and spelling errors, but they're adequate. I might continue making my own subtitles for my own satisfaction. Asteroid Blues is now complete, so if anyone wants a download for Episode 1's subtitles, or has any requests for a specific episode, messsage me and I'll see what we can work out."

I never understood how people could charge $20+ for T-shirts, and expect to sell any, it's too rich for my bank account. I did score some nice stickers for my scooter though, and by ordering more than 6 I got them half price, so I got that going for me, which is nice.

cowboybebop,39ibr1,FreakyJk,11,Thu Jun 11 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"Man, that takes me back to the days of the ol' dial up 56k modems, and my first adventures across the internet. Back in a time where most websites looked like that one, in one way or another. More text than anything else, download links generally didn't have pictures, and things were just simple all around. It was a grand time to be a kid or a teen. None of the social media mess either. Just the occasional forum or message board you'd stumble across that had like, 50 people tops who'd post there. There was no Youtube, no Netflix, no Dailymotion, or anything like that to find full episodes of a show to watch. You were either a skillful internet-pirate who knew how to navigate the seedier parts of the web to find that sort thing (and on a gamble too), or you got your fix offline. But the discussions you'd have, the screen caps you'd find, the OVA music videos people would make... it all seemed to add to the experience and the hype of watching a show like Cowboy Bebop. Finding like minded friends who even bothered with anime in rural South Alabama was a chore of its own, much less finding friends who'd seen and enjoyed CB. But on the internet, in the right places, and in the right setting, everyone was a fan. Everyone wanted to talk about it. Everyone wanted to share their fan art, their realizations, their fan theories. Everyone wanted to be a part of something awesome, and that's just what it was. An awesome, over-the-top-for-its-time, epic experience.     These days most would scoff at an old website like that. For me, they take me back about 15 years or so, to a much simpler time.    Thanks for the nostalgia trip /u/FreakyJK. It was quite pleasant, to say the least."
cowboybebop,39ibr1,salty_d0ge,3,Fri Jun 12 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"This is basically how I felt, minus Alabama and having trouble finding irl people to chat with.   The nostalgia is great with this one."

cowboybebop,39ibr1,PictureofPoritrin,3,Fri Jun 12 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"I used to go on this website every day a long time ago. Good to see the recognition. The website's curator, a person who referred to themselves simply as Fata Morgana, helped me obtain the MP3s of the two Poor Faye piano tracks. They legitimately crafted who I am as a person. I burned them to CDs and walked out into the woods listening to them as a kid. I felt this profound melancholy while doing so. It was something else, but whatever it was, it has to do with who I am now. This whole show does.   Anyway, Fata Morgana, my mirage, I've sent you a few emails over the years thanking you for those two tracks. I don't know if you're part of this community, but if you are, I hope you see this and know how much you touched my life."
cowboybebop,39hz1l,CptSnowcone,4,Thu Jun 11 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"Other than what MaceZilla said; I recommend not marathoning it. Take every session by itself and think over it, each individual episode covers certain things. They're not all totally separated, but it's not like regular anime with a clear distinct goal that they get closer to every episode. Things do grow, change and develop, but they're either in small moments or dedicated to entire sessions. Marathoning, at least to me, takes away how special and distinct each individual session is"
cowboybebop,39hz1l,Mr_Flippers,3,Thu Jun 11 22:11:25 2015 UTC,"I watched the series for the first time several months ago.  I don't have a site recommendation, but I can give my quick summary of the show.  They're bounty hunters.  The series begins with a type of ""bounty of the day"" theme for each episode.  But it quickly goes into another direction as you learn more about the characters and the interactions/motives they have with one another.  You see how their past is shaping their current decisions.  My description sounds a little boring because I don't want to ruin this for you.  Just know that if you find it slow at first, hang in there.  This show is a work of art."
cowboybebop,39hz1l,MaceZilla,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:47:15 2015 UTC,"no problem, i know several people that have watched it and i've only heard good things about it, so i'm willing to stick through. thanks"

They have it for a decent price.  Try looking up promo coupons online.  The show is amazing: deep characters, the best music, engrossing art design... Take the plunge, cowboy."
cowboybebop,39hz1l,ShadowKing94,2,Fri Jun 12 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"I personally use watchdub.com. It's a decent site for dubbed anime.  Highly recommend the show, it's not necessarily about a topic, it's about everything life throws your way.  But the general theme is bounty hunters getting by and chasing bounty heads.  The show has an amazing feel to it that is really defined session by session! So don't watch m all in one go, except maybe the two double sessions.  Don't rush the show and find nice suited moments to watch each episode, like a nice quite evening or something. It's what makes the show just a bit better to watch, in my humble opinion.  Also, have fun. You'll enjoy it, best anime out there!"

cowboybebop,39ecd7,GamePrime99,4,Thu Jun 11 04:16:46 2015 UTC,"Spike and Jet silently eating their feelings away, Faye drawing an outline where her bed used to be, Ed's final message drawn on the floor of the ship…  Yeah, this is definitely the saddest scene for me."
cowboybebop,39ecd7,Kino_the_Wanderer,2,Fri Jun 12 16:07:02 2015 UTC,"Very good, and sad, episode. Surely 25, or at least 26, had a similar effect!..Assuming you've watched it by now."
cowboybebop,39ecd7,Symbi0tic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"Yep just finished it about 20 minutes ago. I'm on an emotional roller coaster right now. Phenomenal show. I'm glad I stuck with it and watched till the end. I still say 24 is the saddest. Idk why I just shed a tear when everyone left to do their own thing and then Ein (who's my favorite character for some reason) went and joined Ed. Also sad that Ed wasn't in Real Folk Blues, but there also wasn't no point for her to be in it."
cowboybebop,39ecd7,sacred_agents,5,Thu Jun 11 06:32:05 2015 UTC,"True, but then Ed is also the last to join the series, not appearing until Episode 9 ... I'm not sure why they introduced her so late, but though she has some major contributions, she (along with Ein) are just supporting characters ... And not needed for most of the stories.  Couldn't imagine “Mushroom HuntingSamba” without her, though."
cowboybebop,39ecd7,sacred_agents,4,Thu Jun 11 13:15:40 2015 UTC,Mushroom Samba was amazing.

cowboybebop,39ecd7,deadfenix,2,Tue Jun 23 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"I just recently went through Bebop for the 4th or 5th time myself and there was something about the end of that episode that packed a HUGE, unexpected emotional punch this time around (just like Speak Like a Child).  I'm not sure if I just didn't remember it or if it has a different meaning to me now that I'm older.  But I guess that's another reason why Bebop is so great.  You experience the full emotional spectrum."
cowboybebop,39ecd7,chubbyurma,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:41:05 2015 UTC,"Since I finished it last night, I've been on a emotional roller coaster. After seeing that in that Session, the ending of the whole show, and then today in English class I saw the ending of ""Of Mice and Men"" if you ever heard of the book or movie before. But I couldn't get a break for those few hours haha. But yeah I'll admit I cried when Ed and Ein left. I wish Ein stayed with the Bebop crew but he was closer to Ed than any one else."

cowboybebop,3982o6,Symbi0tic,4,Tue Jun 9 22:50:36 2015 UTC,"Almost all of these tracks were used in Session XX, Mish-Mash Blues. I believe there was only one song other than the ones listed here that was used in the episode (not counting the commercials), but that one is common knowledge: Shakkazombie - Recover the Sky of Day.  I'd previously uploaded only Tokyo Tower, which is the most popular song from the episode, but it had been recorded with a low quality record player and the record itself was dirty. Tokyo Tower was the only song on the album at the time that didn't skip, actually. So after purchasing a new record player and having the record cleaned, I was able to rip the entire album.  I'll edit this comment to include a link to download the MP3s later tonight most likely.  Edit: [Download MP3 Pack, 320kbps]  Edit2: [Download FLAC Pack]"

cowboybebop,3982o6,Marathon_Cake,3,Sat Jun 13 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"I was reluctant to spend too much on a record player, but the one I bought was $160 ""refurbished,"" but essentially in new condition with a generic box. I'm pretty impressed with it so far, so I'd say it was worth it. It records a little soft, but for the money you can't beat it.  I have the .wav files for each side of the album, so if you really want a .flac for each song I can see what I can do."
cowboybebop,3982o6,Marathon_Cake,2,Sat Jun 13 00:47:44 2015 UTC,"I might have to look into getting one for myself then. It seems like a good investment.  As for the flacs, if you're too busy and don't mind sharing the .wav files, I wouldn't mind doing it myself and uploading them here.  Anyway, cheers and thanks for the upload :D"
cowboybebop,3982o6,idkzhao,3,Sat Jun 13 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"I converted 7/8 of the tracks to .flac for ya. I'll have to re-record track 4 before I convert it because I accidentally cut it too short on my first recording. I had to re-record it for the MP3, but I did not re-record the entire side, so I didn't overwrite my existing .wav.  Once I do that I'll post a link."
cowboybebop,3982o6,code987,2,Sat Jun 13 20:49:38 2015 UTC,I really hope I'm not the only one you're doing this for ahah. Sorry for all the hard work

cowboybebop,3982o6,gocram,2,Tue Jun 9 23:01:21 2015 UTC,No problem! Had to mail the record out to get cleaned and wait for it to return. I'll upload the MP3s in a bit. They're all 320kbps.

cowboybebop,3951vm,ryanson209,25,Tue Jun 9 08:46:28 2015 UTC,I got into Jazz through Bebop. It's so varied it gives you a good scope. Pretty much the style of music I primarily listen to now as well.
cowboybebop,3951vm,Elazuul,9,Tue Jun 9 10:09:57 2015 UTC,"Same thing for me. If you just listen to some of the Spotify jazz playlists, you can find so much great music. Bebop was what got me started on it too though."

At no point do I think I would have gotten into jazz in its entirety if it weren't for Cowboy Bebop. I owe my tastes, influences and inspiration to the soundtrack and love it to bits."
cowboybebop,3951vm,Piku_Chan,4,Tue Jun 9 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"Nope. Aside from the fact that there isn't really that much jazz in the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack, the little bit of jazz there is isn't terribly representative of jazz in general   Just give them this guide  http://i.imgur.com/IaOOo.png"
cowboybebop,3951vm,itsasillyplace,3,Wed Jun 10 02:35:31 2015 UTC,Id say so. I fell in love with tank at a young age but never had the opportunity for someone to expand on it.
cowboybebop,3951vm,del64,3,Tue Jun 9 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"I didnt get into Jazz because of Cowboy Bebop as i was a fan well before it. However, it is one of the best ways to get into it because of how well composed it is."
cowboybebop,3951vm,Thedamned22,2,Tue Jun 9 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"I would say yes.  Through the series, you can be exposed to a wide variety of music styles, mostly related to jazz.  You won't hear full recordings or get any idea of jazz song structure and such, and some of the pieces fit the mold loosely, but there is a lot of jazz there to hear.  It is mostly bent toward bebop and blues, but there are all kinds of other subgenre things in the mix.    For instance, the vast majority of jazz standards share a structure (as well as a pool of song 'layouts')  Many of the pieces on the CB soundtrack CDs have very short improv sections, but they are there, so they fit the head-improv-head structure common to the vast majority of jazz.  However, there are certainly many outliers, extremes, and renegades in the history (and ongoing) of the music.    I think you can spark a taste for jazz in someone who you expose to the series, for sure.    And if you want to know more about conventions within jazz,  look for articles on ""How to listen to jazz"" or something like Jerry Coker's book, How to listen to Jazz."

Some jazz I enjoy greatly while others I find kind of esoteric and hard to get into."

I happened to tune in as the opening fight scene with spike in the convenience store was happening .... and instantly hooked."
cowboybebop,3932lp,pica0050,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:27:26 2015 UTC,"People say it takes place between 22 and 23, but it's not definitive. This is the conclusion because Andy makes a cameo in the parade at the end of the movie as a Samurai, which he became at the end of Session 22, and Big Shot is on the air in the movie, while it is canceled in Session 23.  There are a few theories about the movie. Honestly, I believe it's all a dream. Spike is asleep at the beginning of the movie, possibly awakes briefly in the middle of the movie, and he's asleep at the end of the movie. Closing the movie, we're greeted with ""are you living in the real world?"" It would also explain Vincent's seemingly superhuman powers--beyond what is explained from simply being a test subject for the nano machines."
cowboybebop,3932lp,Symbi0tic,9,Tue Jun 9 01:37:16 2015 UTC,"It's not opinion, it's a fact that it takes place between 22-23; from the original website made for the film:https://web.archive.org/web/20021117151532/http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/movie/index.html  Your theory is all dependent on very few scenes of Spike napping. Spike naps a lot throughout the series, it's part of his character, but beside from that, you quote the closing line? It's not enough proof for a dream sequence.   I don't think Watanabe, a great director, would spend a 2 hour movie just for a dream sequence to be suggested so weakly. We would need many more indicators of a possible disassociation with reality FROM Spike and not so much from Vincent. The final line is ambiguous, yet related to the movie, in the same way every closing line of ANY episode of Bebop relates to their appropriate episode. They're usually a quirky way to say ""to be continued..."" It's actually one of Bebop's more shallow features; not incredible thought is really thrown into them.   If you want a film where the protagonist's reality is muddled, try ""Shutter Island"" or ""The Machinist.""   Vincent was not super human, but he was a super soldier because of the nano machines. And that's enough explanation because he was THE only one that survived the experiment--but aside from the great abilities, a side effect was hallucinations, which is why he can't discern ""dreams from reality.""  Edit: The movie is 2 hours, not 2.5.  I typed too fast."
cowboybebop,3932lp,i_Got_Rocks,-1,Tue Jun 9 05:47:02 2015 UTC,"Vincent was definitely superhuman. Not sure how you could argue against it. Dropping from the height of the bridge at the beginning of the movie only to disappear and survive? Surviving the grenade explosion and once again disappearing without a trace? Piercing Spike's chest with his fingers? Vincent only had the ""antidote"", so to speak, to counter-act the effects of the nano machines. It had side-effects, but it wouldn't explain these situations. He passed the antidote to Electra and Faye; where are their superhuman abilities?  Spike is not only ""napping"" in the scenes that I referred to; he's in the same exact position and it's both the beginning and end of the movie. We also never see Spike actually awake at the beginning, and why is that? You have to understand that Cowboy Bebop is composed of many homages and ""tropes,"" and while they always referred to figuratively dreaming in the series, they never actually touched upon the common, true ""it was all a dream"" sequence, and it would be just like Shinichiro Watanabe and the others to leave this ambiguous. To suggest that they would've had to ""muddle"" his reality in order for this theory to be reasonable is just silly.  But the one take-away from your post is the content from the mirror of the original website, which I was unaware of. So thanks for that; not so much for your condescending tone."
cowboybebop,3932lp,Symbi0tic,2,Tue Jun 9 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"I think the implication is that Spike is waking up from the dream that is the entire show, adding onto the show's themes of dreams upon dreams. This does not mean the show never happened. Spike doesn't fully wake up until the final episode."

cowboybebop,38enyo,BGrizzle93,11,Wed Jun 3 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"I love how Samurai Champloo feels like the direct inverse of Cowboy Bebop. Cowboys to samurai, the near future to the near past, old black music to new black music, a tale of running away to a tale of pursuit.  Great music, great characters, great acting in both audio tracks, just completely great. Easily my 2nd favorite Watanabe series behind Bebop."
cowboybebop,38enyo,jaytreaty17181,6,Wed Jun 3 23:34:52 2015 UTC,I loved this show because I just loved how the hip hop blended in so smoothly with the scenes. Also since it was a bunch of filler episodes it was really easy to pick up.
cowboybebop,38enyo,KrobbleGoo,5,Wed Jun 3 20:03:10 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really call them filler episodes as much as I would say episodic. The main focus was finding the sun flower samurai but the real reward for their journey was the journey itself. This is reinforced through many of the episodes being side adventures that had nothing to do with the sunflower samurai.
cowboybebop,38enyo,KrobbleGoo,2,Thu Jun 4 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"Most of Watanabe's shows are called filler simply because they're episodic, even though every episode in a show like Bebop or Champloo is important in some way, be it character development, foreshadowing, theming, or the overall story arc."
cowboybebop,38enyo,jaytreaty17181,3,Thu Jun 4 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"Beautiful animation, beautiful soundtrack, and wonderful characters. The entire atmosphere of the show is directly on point. That being said, this show's ending is the worst ending i have ever seen in an anime. It was utterly disappointing, leaving much to be desired. As far as the show itself though? Great, right up there with Bebop."

cowboybebop,38enyo,jesuskater,2,Wed Jun 3 22:35:59 2015 UTC,It definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. The show was wonderful though. I was just so bitterly disappointed by that ending. Especially since i had watched bebop right before champloo.
cowboybebop,38enyo,Aperture-Employee,4,Wed Jun 3 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"I loved the ending, I would of had it no other way. They were never meant to all travel together forever they were only meant to have this one journey and that's what made it so special. I would almost compare their journey to watching the actual show, it is a fantastic ride but it had to end. Mugen, Jin, and fu all go their separate ways, probably never to meet again but to think fondly of their time together from time to time. Just like how the show's fans think fondly of it every now and then. They finished their journey and that was it."
cowboybebop,38enyo,jesuskater,2,Thu Jun 4 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"They all shouldn't have cheated death. Mugen and Jin were either meant to die or kill each other. Sure they bonded and all, but they are samurai, not superheroes."

cowboybebop,38enyo,BGrizzle93,4,Wed Jun 3 23:38:05 2015 UTC,I love it a lot. Got episodes 1-13 yesterday actually
cowboybebop,38enyo,BGrizzle93,3,Thu Jun 4 01:49:09 2015 UTC,"Space Dandy was a real mixed bag. When it was good it could be EXCELLENT. A world with no sadness might be the best stand alone anime episode I have ever seen, its beautiful in every sense of the word. The show starts off slow, and the popular 3 episode rule means that a lot of people dropped it pretty fast and disregarded the show as bad. That is a shame, as I honestly think it was in the sphere of AOTY, and someone could very well make a case for it.   I think watching it now instead of week by week slightly loses its charm, because there was a degree of anticipation to see whether you would strike gold or meh that week, still I would recommend watching it for sure. I enjoyed it more than Terror in resonance, as that show faltered a lot after the first 5 episodes."
cowboybebop,38enyo,MrB51,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"I think a strong argument could be made for Space Dandy being the best anime of the decade so far, albeit Madoka Magica is up there as well."

cowboybebop,38enyo,Aperture-Employee,2,Fri Jun 5 02:09:26 2015 UTC,Honestly I hate this show. It reminds me of one of those animes I tried to avoid. I also think it tries a little too hard in he funny department

cowboybebop,38enyo,DogTheGayFish,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:03:38 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that each episode had it's own director. Some of which you may recognize from style alone. This explains both the episodic nature and why dandy and crew died in episode 1 and every other episode. Knowing this i found the anime to be really fresh something like a cool concept, but to others I can see why they dislike it because there's no underlying plot and it can see too ""tryhard or deliberately being arty"" when it switches between styles so quickly.   You can find the list of episode directors here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Space_Dandy_episodes  maybe find more stuff you might like."

cowboybebop,38enyo,MrB51,3,Wed Jun 3 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"First 5 episodes VERY GOOD, a lot of directions the show could have gone and the hype was insane. A poor couple of episodes involving a certain white haired lady and an airport chess game kind of killed it (The airport thing was a cool idea but the implementation was pretty bad) I think poor execution kind of made the show weaker than it should have been, as certain aspects of it were top notch as the show could go from being pretty intelligent to dumb in a matter of seconds... Still a good show, just should have been great. I mean after the first 5 episodes I legitimately thought there was a chance of it being one of the best anime ever created, but man the female characters just written straight up poorly and Shibasaki was sort of shafted...  It sounds like I'm shitting on it a lot but check it out, its probably better to watch it without the hype giving a fairly high standard. If you like shows/movies about the youth fighting trying to rise up kind of deal then you will probably like this alot."

If you haven't seen the Cowboy Bebop movie, do that. One last time with Spike and the crew.   The only other animation that's come close to Cowboy IMO is Avatar:The Last Airbender (since it nails group dynamic and character chemistry in a similar fashion) but it's pretty damn different thematically."

cowboybebop,38dtmg,g33kn3rd,2,Thu Jun 4 04:04:04 2015 UTC,Watch Trigun. It has a somewhat similar feel to Bebop. Both are fantastic
cowboybebop,38dtmg,Xator_Nova,2,Wed Jun 3 22:25:18 2015 UTC,"IMO if you watch an anime the same time as you have the void left from another series the anime will feel less good then it should have been if you havent had the void before.   Though if you want anime that is like Bebop i really recommend  Samurai champloo: It is from the same author as cowboy bebop and also the same script writer.  Trigun: It has the same art style (they are both from the late 90s) with a really badass main protagonist, an awesome villain and really good side characters.  I would also recommend Mushishi: It has the same episodic feel as bebop just a bit more extreme in that sense, it is really relaxing to just watch some episodes and the art is just beautiful.   And just because I also want to recommend another classic.   Neon Genesis Evangelion: It is an anime from the same time as Bebop and Trigun with a really interesting story, It does not have the same feel as bebop but just because it is one of the classics i recommend it.  I rated all the anime that i recommended 9/10"
cowboybebop,38dtmg,SwickFC,2,Thu Jun 4 08:42:48 2015 UTC,"You should definitely attempt to watch other anime of its generation.  Try with this list (you have already watched Bebop, so skip #1 :P )   Cowboy Bebop (Shinichiro Watanabe) Princess Mononoke (Hayao Miyazaki) Neon Genesis Evangelion (Hideaki Anno) Ghost in the Shell / Patlabor 2 (Mamoru Oshii) Revolutionary Girl Utena (Kunihiko Ikuhara) The Vision of Escaflowne (Kazuki Akane) Perfect Blue (Satoshi Kon) Jin-Roh (Hiroyuki Okiura) Serial Experiments: Lain (Ryutaro Nakamura) Trigun (Satoshi Nishimura)   As for more recent anime, Baccano!, Space Dandy and Blood Blockade Battlefront are also highly recommended if you liked the style of Cowboy Bebop."

cowboybebop,38dtmg,roninsascha,2,Sat Jun 6 11:29:25 2015 UTC,"This question gets asked pretty often. If you want it to be anything like Cowboy Bebop, avoid the ""Space Dandy"" recommendations. It's only recommended because Bebop's director directed that as well.  In that vein, Samurai Champloo is much better. But Champloo just didn't stick with me that much. I'd say Trigun is your best bet if you don't mind a little over-the-top silliness for the first half of the series."
cowboybebop,38dtmg,JosiahSethWilliams,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:16:28 2015 UTC,"r/anime is awesome for suggestions. Also check out myanimelist.com. Make an account and track what you watch it'll give you great recommendations. I'll give you some shows I enjoyed after bebop which I considered my first ""grown up"" anime as compared to shows like dbz, ygo, Pokemon, etc, etc.   Samurai Champloo. This is a must. If you want to get Into anime and bebop was the reason, Champloo should be the next in line.   If you really enjoyed that you can go watch all of watanabe's other works like terror in resonance (which was good but nothing he made lived up to Champloo or bebop that I've seen so far, imo. Plus kids on the block and space dandy are WAY different. I don't know why so many people are recommending dandy right after bebop)  Here's some recommendations outside of his work that aren't trigun and have great animation, action packed, and are a bit newer:  Psycho Pass. The first season is amazing. I don't think I've ever gone through an anime so quickly because I just couldn't take waiting to watch another episode. Also gave me that same ""mature"" feel bebop did. Fair warning though, second season does NOT live up to the first at all.   Aldnoah Zero. I've seen mixed reviews. Personally, I loved it. Thought it was a great anime. Lots of action and suspense. Huge futuristic robots and a war between earth and Mars.... How is that not cool?  Fate/Zero. I didn't have it in me to watch all of the other fate series. But I did enjoyed zero. People are summoned to compete for a holy grail and earn a mystical servant from old folk tales that have insane power. Again, Lots of action.   Now some that I really enjoyed just getting into anime that aren't as ""mature"" feeling as Bebop...  Attack on Titan. It gets some hate on reddit but it's popular for a reason. I loved watching it.   Gurren Lagann. I started this thinking ""why am I watching this stupid anime?"" But stuck through it. Wound up being my favorite next to bebop. Seriously amazing.   Sword Art Online. Another one that gets mixed reviews. The first 15 episodes are FANTASTIC. It changes gears a little bit after that though and loses a lot of action. But at the very least watch the first 15 you'll enjoy it. Make the decision for yourself on the rest of the anime. I enjoyed it personally.   Those are some good ones to get started with anime. Next on my list is Hajime no Ippo. And I'm super excited to start that."

Samurai Champloo may fill that void, maybe Space Dandy or Baccano. Fullmetal Alchemist (both versions) is up there with Bebop in terms of accessibility. Neon Genesis Evangelion and Kino's Journey are on par with it in terms of quality, but hit some different tones and moods.  Don't go into any of these expecting them to be as effective as Bebop though."

Bebop has a lot of intricacies and quality, so it challenges the viewer to be mentally active in order to take in the whole experience which results in a delayed, albeit more thorough satisfaction. My suggestions are more superficial in that you don't really have to be as aware, and you can just watch the show and take it at face value to get some gratification. Out of all of the suggestions, Trigun is by far the closest to Cowboy Bebop. It has a bad ass main character with a dramatic past that catches up to him in the end. I love Yu Yu Hakusho the most out of all of my suggestions though."
cowboybebop,38bl3j,CorpDelta,10,Wed Jun 3 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"I've been hearing this for years and no one I've asked has been able to source it. So far as I know, it's the fandom's equivalent to an old wive's tale."

cowboybebop,38bl3j,DandyCowboy,11,Wed Jun 3 06:29:04 2015 UTC,"It would be fascinating if he preferred audio for a language he (presumably) doesn't speak.   It's not that far fetched. I didn't speak/understand English when I was growing up. During that period I (and all the other kids) preferred English language music. We imagined that the lyrics of English language songs are somehow deeper/better, not as banal and stupid as the pop songs in our own language that we could understand. Now that I understand both... there isn't much difference.  Of course this doesn't apply directly to Watanabe, because he knows what the characters are saying. Still in his ear the sound of an exotic foreign language may add spice."
cowboybebop,38bl3j,DandyCowboy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:40:05 2015 UTC,"I think he'd prefer the voice acting he had direct involvement in producing, but he might like the dub. Who knows. I kinda wish people wouldn't treat a rumor so highly though."
cowboybebop,38bl3j,PanicStricken,3,Wed Jun 3 14:33:28 2015 UTC,"Doesn't surprise me at all. In fact, Bebop is a show that is artistically meant to be expressed in English. There's a reason he drew from so much Western influence (something prominent in all of his shows). Needless to say he is probably the most western-oriented director I've seen"
cowboybebop,38bl3j,PanicStricken,2,Wed Jun 3 16:44:14 2015 UTC,"By that logic, should Kill Bill be watched dubbed in Japanese?  I agree, the dub is amazing, but all I'm looking for is a legitimate source."
cowboybebop,38bl3j,DandyCowboy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:05:44 2015 UTC,"Well Kill Bill doesn't have a lot of Japanese characters from what I've seen and the director geared it towards Western audiences. For instance, the director of Trigun intended for it to be seen in English"
cowboybebop,38bl3j,NoNormals,2,Wed Jun 3 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"Kill Bill has multiple Japanese characters and a third of the cast is Japanese, two chapters are in Japan with predominantly Japanese dialogue, hell one chapter is straight up anime.

cowboybebop,37wsz5,maxdurden,8,Sun May 31 01:32:58 2015 UTC,It's my second favorite right behind Hard Luck Women. Jupiter Jazz is such a badass two parter. I feel like that's when the series really hits it's stride. What are some of your favorite scenes from the episode?
cowboybebop,37wsz5,OBMSIA,4,Sun May 31 15:21:39 2015 UTC,"I feel these are the best scenes from Jupiter Jazz (in no particular order):  1) Spike and Jets argument at the beginning after hearing about Codename Julia.  2) Gren's apartment scene - there is something about that scene that was mentioned in another post on here somewhere that was very relatable... A warm friendly haven from the cold elements outside... And the dark truth lurking underneath.  3) Faye finding the truth about Gren/Lin shooting Spike tandem - As per usual, any scene that involves both Spike and Vicious is always beautiful, if not moving. They did these two scenes in tandem very well."
cowboybebop,37wsz5,_phineas_,6,Sun May 31 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"The song that plays at the end, Space Lion, is so fuckin choice."
cowboybebop,37wsz5,DennisNedry_,4,Sun May 31 16:13:30 2015 UTC,Space Lion does rock. Another reason Jupiter Jazz is the best session/sessions out there.
cowboybebop,37wsz5,Spacegaterambler,3,Sun May 31 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm pandering, but they're all great to me, though Jupiter Jazz 1&2 seal the series perfectly. A few episodes seem like down time, but Cowboy Funk, Mushroom Samba, along with a few others, are hilarious episodes that are simply, IMO, stylistically diverse from the more serious episodes, and get judged on a different scale."
cowboybebop,37wsz5,vinsky119,1 point,Sun May 31 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. Mushroom Samba is amazing but as far as 'that' spectrum goes, I'd have to say Toys in the Attic."
cowboybebop,37wsz5,Xator_Nova,3,Sun May 31 16:20:42 2015 UTC,"The Jupiter Jazz is one of my favorites, along with Ganymede Elegy, because it tells a story and give more information about the planets and life in the future, which I find very fascinating.  The ending credits with the Space Lion song is really epic. Gives me the chills every time."
cowboybebop,37wsz5,Xator_Nova,2,Mon Jun 1 08:03:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think it was supposed to be the 'actual' ending to the series, but then they decided to go to 23. So maybe that explains the terminal feeling you get."
cowboybebop,37wsz5,Mescal_Caulchester,2,Sun May 31 21:42:45 2015 UTC,"A good thought. I can see where your coming from with that; the ""terminal"" feeling is very prominent throughout both parts of Jupiter Jazz."
cowboybebop,37ut1j,Spacegaterambler,8,Sat May 30 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't know if I prefer the idea that Spike survived the final encounter with Vicious or if he died. No one wants one of their favourite characters to die, but to have him live might kill the narrative. Thoughts?"
cowboybebop,37ut1j,MoarStruts,2,Sat May 30 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"The star fading out at the end during the credits I think is pretty definitive that he died, aside from that fact that the shaman says exactly that as well.  The only thing that makes me think he didn't is the random scenes of some experiments or maybe surgery(?) being done in a totally white room and a figure that seems to be the outline of Spike. Or maybe I just missed what those were really all about."
cowboybebop,37ut1j,sloppydoombags,6,Sun May 31 05:10:08 2015 UTC,I believe those scenes referenced the surgery Spike had to get his cybernetic eye.
cowboybebop,37ut1j,sloppydoombags,3,Sun May 31 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I also wondered if it was something like that or just a straight fake eye, but I would think that would make piloting and shooting pretty tricky."
cowboybebop,37ut1j,Avishan,1 point,Sun May 31 18:15:53 2015 UTC,"I've always pictured Spike as dying.  Without his death, the entire genre themes they draw on would be irrelevant.  The Bebop is the place that each character is drawn to between their story arcs.  Faye's experience on the Bebop is a catalyst for her story.  Without the ship and crew she would've never discovered who she was.  Jet's place on the Bebop was the end to his story; he left the police force, and his story is wrapped up because of his bounty hunting.  Ed's place is a prologue.  The half remembered dream of younger days as she moves on to bigger and better things.  For Spike, this trope is continued, but for his story arc, it is the lull between the beginning and the end.  His story began and Mars, and the staging grounds for some battles were elsewhere because of the ship, but ultimately ended back on Mars.  Without this ending, the tropes, story arcs and themes would be driven moot.  The end of Spike, in my opinion, gives meaning to the rest.  This is just my two cents though."
cowboybebop,37ut1j,Mescal_Caulchester,2,Sun May 31 02:31:10 2015 UTC,Very well said. I like the idea of Ed's story as a prologue. Each character owns the story of Cowboy Bebop in their own way. You choose the main character you would like to follow.

cowboybebop,36syvy,ofonelevel,13,Fri May 22 06:13:41 2015 UTC,Honestly there really isn't any anime that's all that similar to Cowboy Bebop.  But you might like Planets or Black Lagoon.
cowboybebop,36syvy,Godofallu,8,Thu May 21 22:04:50 2015 UTC,Black Lagoon is pretty good.
cowboybebop,36syvy,snowtrooper,10,Thu May 21 23:36:26 2015 UTC,Cowboy Bebop is a genre unto itself. An entirely different thing!
cowboybebop,36syvy,Zywakem,18,Fri May 22 00:01:28 2015 UTC,"my bad, i forgot Samurai Champloo"
cowboybebop,36syvy,lovemyMFLB,16,Thu May 21 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Space Dandy (also made by Shinichiro Watanabe and in the same universe as Bebop, but further in the future and more of a comedy.)  I'd also say it's worth checking out Hamatora if you liked the art of Bebop. It's flashier, but pretty interesting. There's also some good character development.  Sadly though, trying to find something like Cowboy Bebop is like trying to capture lightning in a bottle.   I suspect Champloo is also in the Bebop universe (technically ours) and that Champloo, Bebop and Dandy are all somehow related."

cowboybebop,36syvy,Symbi0tic,3,Fri May 22 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"Monster is a really good anime in regards to the serious nature of the subject matter while generally avoiding many tropes that I think brings down other animes.  It's a serious anime that stays serious.  It's a bit slow paced (which I didn't notice, but it's a common complaint), but otherwise an excellent show."
cowboybebop,36syvy,cryptobum,2,Thu May 21 22:50:31 2015 UTC,Big-O. Samurai Champloo. Shigurui death frenzy. Try those out
cowboybebop,36syvy,Vinylking101,2,Fri May 22 06:03:26 2015 UTC,"Trigun should definitely be your first watch. It's not quite the same, and it's a bit more farfetched, but it's one of the closest, and most enjoyable, that I could recommend. Tsuneo Imahori created the soundtrack for the series and he was a part of The Seatbelts.  It's mostly silly fun for the first half of the series, but the second half gets dark rather quickly, which is only hinted at a bit in the first 11 episodes. 26 episodes total, like Bebop, and a movie--although, the dubbed movie does not reprise the entire original cast (only the main character).  Samurai Champloo was alright. Definitely similarities to Bebop, and if you watch the dub, you'll enjoy the voice actors. Didn't really have an impact on me in the long-run, though.  Space Dandy is pure silly, nothing like Cowboy Bebop other than it was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and some people claim it's ""in the same universe,"" which is not true, it just has homages to Bebop here and there.  You know what to do!"

cowboybebop,36q65m,Rayn_the_hunter,38,Thu May 21 06:26:33 2015 UTC,"I think you'd better off explaining to us what it is you consider better than Cowboy Bebop. In the end, it's highly subjective, and knowing what your typical anime interests are would surely help us come to a better conclusion for you.  It should go without argument that Cowboy Bebop stands out greatly amongst almost all other anime, and it's one of the only in existence that has the power to attract even those that have no interest in anime in general.  It's simply a masterpiece, in the minds of many."
cowboybebop,36q65m,Symbi0tic,20,Thu May 21 06:46:56 2015 UTC,"I swear, if OP delivers to this comment with SAO..."
cowboybebop,36q65m,StarPupil,3,Thu May 21 13:05:01 2015 UTC,"SAO is good. Not GOAT good, but it's good. I think the hate and the hype are both overdone and need to calm down."
cowboybebop,36q65m,StarPupil,12,Thu May 21 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"The joke is that anime noobs always seem to compare classic works (Eva, Trigun, Bebop) to SAO. These are all fairly great shows, and many, myself included, feel that comparing them to the latest megahype show (AoT, KLK, SAO, etc.) is both unfair to the latest fad show and disrespectful to the classics. Like if someone said that Twilight is better than, say, The Count of Monte Cristo. Sure, you personally may have enjoyed it more, or simply not have understood Monte Cristo, but sating that it's better is simply unfair and disrespectful. Plus, many times they are simply incomparable. So in this case, one is a somewhat serialized harem based in a shitty, inaccurate MMO and the other one is an episodic, character-based Space Opera about bounty hunters who suck at their jobs with somewhat mysterious pasts and mob connections. And FMA is a serialized, character-focused fantasy steampunk epic. And for the record, I like FMA:B just a little bit more."
cowboybebop,36q65m,Acmnin,6,Thu May 21 19:51:42 2015 UTC,"FMA:B will be considered classic. SAO, doubtful."
cowboybebop,36q65m,StarPupil,8,Thu May 21 20:09:41 2015 UTC,Sure. I really like FMA:B.
cowboybebop,36q65m,Acmnin,1 point,Thu May 21 21:07:38 2015 UTC,"Personally my favourite anime is FMAB. The plot and characters are amazing and they all mesh together so well. And I just didn't get that from Bebop. It was very episodic with a faint plot that was only shown in a few episodes. The music was great, but the characters felt like they were missing development, or rather that we as viewers missed their development. I just felt like Bebop was a bunch of littler adventures with four or so episodes that tied the characters in a plot."
cowboybebop,36q65m,naked_avenger,12,Thu May 21 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"Watch it again. It's a show that homages every type of entertainment you can think of for decades, focusing on noir and other genre's you may or may not have heard of.  One episode homages, Alien and 2001. This show is amazing.   It's not FMAB; it's not a straight through story, it's examining our characters pasts, the mistakes they made and whether they will make them again(Jet does not, Spike does), and also putting a lense and criticism on lot's of older works. You aren't supposed to see the type of plot driven character development that an FMA:B provides. You don't measure a work on how it compares to others, but as what it provides for itself.   One episode has a cover of Pink Floyd's - On The Run and homages Batman The Animated Series....   The point isn't the plot it's the experience, you see these people banding together because they have all been abandoned or broken in some way. You get snippets of why and how they got together, and the end of their adventure. It's most certainly not an epic fantasy adventure, type deal such as FMA:B."
cowboybebop,36q65m,maks_orp,4,Thu May 21 20:13:00 2015 UTC,"Even though CB is my favorite by far, as someone who also thoroughly enjoyed FMAB, I can understand your position. FMA has a story arc that stretches through pretty much every episode and typically has some kind of hook at the end, especially as it winds down.   They are very different types of shows. CB is more noir while FMA is more about hope and an eventual endpoint. There's a driving force behind the brothers, and it can be easier to relate to them.   A strength of CB is that it appeals to a wider audience. Anime in general can really turn some people off. I'm not a huge fan of anime but there are some shows I've enjoyed, and it's thanks to CB that I watched them. Anime can seem extremely childish to outside observers, and CB is a nice twist to that because it absolutely has an adult feel without being overly gruesome."
cowboybebop,36q65m,ShadowKing94,15,Wed May 27 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Nothing. The title is meaningless. It's arguably among the very best in that space western/space action adventure genre of anime series for all the reasons you can probably name yourself. But comparing it to something like Tatami Galaxy, or Mushi-shi, or Cromartie High School is about as fruitful as trying to decide which is the greatest TV series: Breaking Bad, I Love Lucy, or The Prisoner. Whichever answer you get, you've wasted the time that could be better spent appreciating other great works."
cowboybebop,36q65m,Hetzer,11,Thu May 21 10:31:55 2015 UTC,"Watch it again in a couple of months and you'll agree, I think. Because I liked it so much more the second time, only then I understood a lot of the underlying meanings of sessions."
cowboybebop,36q65m,MissMarzenia,11,Thu May 21 07:54:04 2015 UTC,It's the least embarrassing anime to admit that you really liked.
cowboybebop,36q65m,Acmnin,10,Thu May 21 16:40:34 2015 UTC,"Music. Characters. Absurdity. Mystery, revenge, spaceships...  But mostly music for me.  I agree that it is however matter of taste. I never understood Akira lovers, as far as I agree that it was groundbreaking achievement in world of anime - I would not say it is one of my favorites. By any means.   There is no such thing as greatest anime ever. Everyone will have their own favourite and even then I doubt they can settle with just one."
cowboybebop,36q65m,lovemyMFLB,3,Thu May 21 14:21:28 2015 UTC,"I love Akira, and I love Bebop.  They are so far and away from each other, but both great in their own ways."
cowboybebop,36q65m,maxkmiller,2,Thu May 21 20:16:43 2015 UTC,Perhaps it is just taste. I like anime that feel like they are connected to one or many central plot(s). I don't think Bebop really offers that.
cowboybebop,36q65m,lovemyMFLB,8,Thu May 21 19:30:03 2015 UTC,It's heavy western influence is something that isn't common in Japanese animation. Personally I find the music and characters to be more interesting and unique than most anime.
cowboybebop,36q65m,BobbyBobRoberts,3,Thu May 21 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"This. It's the most westernized Anime that exists. It's not heavy handed with Japanese references and culture. (I couldn't get into Champloo because it's much more Japanese and cartoony, as if every character was animated like Ed. Despite Nujabes being the man.)  The music is incredible, the story is amazingly written and deliberate with symbolism, the characters actually develop and the show knew when it was the right time to conclude and be finished."
cowboybebop,36q65m,Bloody_Heartland,5,Thu May 21 17:44:21 2015 UTC,"the show knew when it was the right time to conclude and be finished.   So true. At first I was incredibly frustrated with it only being one season and a movie. But after rewatching it a few times, I realized one of it's greatest values is that it didn't outrun it's relevance like Naruto, One Piece, and other animes."
cowboybebop,36q65m,Ontopourmama,5,Thu May 21 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, there are so many reasons! There are two big reasons that it's so uniquely popular, and those are that 1) it was one of the first anime titles to get wide exposure on basic cable in the states, making it a lot of people's gateway drug. 2) It's the most non-otaku anime ever. No whining over senpai, no magical alien/monster/droid girls, no random bleeding noses. It rejects many of the genre tropes and conventions to do its own thing, so if you're coming to it expecting to like it because you like anime, it's a very different experience. It's more of a love letter to American culture than anything else, which also makes it more broadly enjoyable for western audiences.  But being able to explain its popularity doesn't mean it's not deserving of very, very high praise. As anime, it was extremely well made for the time. The technical designs are intricate, the sci-fi is complex, the fight scenes are ambitious, and the music... oh, the music! (I'm the mod over at /r/CowboyBebopDeepCuts and I could literally talk at you for hours about the music. I won't. EventhoughIreallywantto)  But it's also a pretty amazing work in its own right. Even though you may initially think there are only five or six episodes that are actually tied to the overarching plot, the reality is that there isn't a single episode of filler. Even the sillier sessions, like Toys in the Attic and Mushroom Samba have a vital place in establishing the characters, providing glimpses of backstory, and fleshing out the crazy huge solar system's worth of world building.  It's also seriously, deeply thought out. You literally can't even get through the opening sequence without a half dozen references woven together into something somehow wholly original. This is a series with something to say, and something to show you, and damn if it doesn't do it with more style than you can shake a stick at. And there's so much there that I'm still finding new things in it after literally a decade and a half of first watching it. I watched it and rewatched it. I've picked it apart and analyzed it. I've written essays about it. No matter how many times I go back to it, I always come away with something new.  I enjoy a lot of anime, but I love Cowboy Bebop."
cowboybebop,36q65m,Zywakem,4,Thu May 21 22:26:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, I like it. Context is important. Cowboy Bebop is about western culture and is loved by a western audience. We in the West can relate to it more than other animes. Also during this time period you couldn't say, ""Samurai Champloo does this but with Hip Hop"" because it didn't. When it first aired in the West, Champloo and a whole lot of animes like it or like Bebop weren't readily available to watch. Bebop was the main star of Adult Swim and YouTube and the Internet wasn't as popular as it is today.  Cowboy Bebop was very 'cool' in many ways. It's about space bounty hunters, add a shit ton of American culture (Coca Cola, Bruce Lee, jazz music, heavy metal music, blaxploitation, etc), add the noir themes, and combined you make something badass. Also a lot of what happens in Bebop we can relate in the western world and many episodes were banned for a while because of it. For example the Teddy Bomber episode deals with terrorism and the episode with Spike being saved by some former NASA ship was banned because it hit too close to the Columbia Shuttle Incident.   There's also different races in Cowboy Bebop: Mexicans, blacks, whites, Asians, Arabs, and Spike himself is supposedly of Israeli descent. This is rare in anime.  I think most importantly it has to do with space being the new frontier. Humanity cannot turn back, Earth is dead, and we can only move forward. However as we move forward we have to abandon the past and then we get the feeling of loneliness and other negative shit like that where we have to over come it. Tons of backstory that isn't explained like Spike possibly faking his death to leave the Red Dragon, why did Vicious hate Spike, what happened in the Gate Incident, Julia's backstory... Hell everyone's got a story in Bebop."
cowboybebop,36q65m,hapticmotion,3,Tue May 26 06:51:22 2015 UTC,I think some of it has to do with the characters actually looking like individuals not like clones of each other with different hair styles....and also that show gets in your head. You'll start thinking about it when you least expect it.....you'll carry that weight.
cowboybebop,36q65m,sloppydoombags,3,Thu May 21 17:39:45 2015 UTC,"Well no one mentioned the music :(  The music was created before anything else, by the great Yoko Kanno (apparently Ed's movements are based on Kanno's). The 6+ hrs of OST are absolutely magnificent, drawing from different genres and styles of jazz (especially Bebop). The depth of music is astounding, it's not just there to provide background to scenes, it's integral to the story itself! There's a reason why the episodes are 'sessions' and the titles are music references.  Also, the detail put into the animation, every weapon is intricately detailed, the spacecraft movements are realistic (Reaction Control Systems!, stuff you'd never see in any show or movie with spacecraft). Did you notice the PS1 lurking in one of the episodes? Or the obviously Batman episode? Or the exact location on Earth Faye's house was on (you can actually go there!)? Not to mention the MASSIVE WESTERN (cowboy) REFERENCES THROUGHOUT!  I recommend watching the series again, with greater depth now you know what's going to happen it leaves your mind looking at other things instead. Watanabe intended for each session to be it's own 'movie'. The beauty of Bebop isn't just the plot, but everything else that comes with it too"
cowboybebop,36q65m,VaroGzz,2,Fri May 22 00:28:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I liked it because it's not as violent as some could be. Faye Valentine for the most part is also an independent woman and takes care of things. I liked the art style too! As I tried to watch an even older anime recently and couldn't get through it because I couldn't deal with the art style. The dub is recognized as the closest English dub to the Japanese version too, so that's maybe another factor."

cowboybebop,36g2b8,_phineas_,22,Tue May 19 02:45:04 2015 UTC,"The scene where Jet gets shot during the Shootout at the Loser Bar seems to be the deciding factor for Spike about going it alone.  He doesn't want his past to hurt or kill anyone; its really him staying true to his character throughout the series, or so I feel."
cowboybebop,36g2b8,Mescal_Caulchester,9,Tue May 19 03:43:54 2015 UTC,The scene where Jet gets shot during the Shootout at the Loser Bar seems to be the deciding factor for Spike about going it alone.    Also the final dogfight scene where Faye's fighter gets damaged pretty hard; meaning she cant do the usual and fly in wrecking havoc.  It's like it was destiny for Spike to go it alone.
cowboybebop,36g2b8,tiger66261,17,Tue May 19 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"This is actually the exact disappointment I initially had when I first watched the series, but I realized something crucial about the characters in the show, and how it connects to the way Spike goes it alone in the end.  The characters have this friendly dynamic, and it's clear they're willing to put others before themselves, but they avoid the friendship trope where immeasurable odds can be overcome through working together with your friends.  There's a subtle darkness, a realism to the series that really makes it relatable and lasting.  As close as the crew may seem, they each have their own lives and problems that they keep to themselves.  Spike and Jet know some about one another just from being together for so long, but as can be seen from their relationship with newer crew members, they aren't the type to pry or stick their noses in others' business.  When Jet has his own excursion to deal with his own past and problems, Spike isn't really around at all.  It's not that they don't care about one another, they just respect that their lives are their own.  They happen to be intertwined by their time together, but they know that they were people with lives and experiences before they crossed paths, and they will continue to be that way.  Jet may care for Spike and what happens to him, but he respects that Spike's journey in the end is Spike's and Spike's alone.  Had he wanted Jet's help, he would've asked.  If you think about the fact that the show is a futuristic western, it fits very well.  There's an independence and an honor in not depending too much on others, even your allies, even if we may find it unfitting from our perspectives.  Spike and Jet are space cowboys; that's how they live and die."
cowboybebop,36g2b8,SenorMcNuggets,10,Tue May 19 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"You also have to take into account the overlying theme of Cowboy Bebop; everyone's along for the ride, but sooner or later, the ride stops. For Jet, that's his encounter with his partner. For Faye, it was recollecting her past, including the man who set her on her path. For Ed, it meant going home.   For Spike, it meant staying dead this time. Their roles/focus sort of correlated with how much time was spent finding their closure.   All of them sort of started with a chip on their shoulder, a single thread that was plucked every now and then during the episodes. Whether it was mentioning a name from the past, or just talking about personal features, it resonated with that one thing. More often than not, it bugged the character to even think about, and resulted in an irritated response. It's a thing that they don't know about themselves, or they DO know, and it's something they're not at peace with.  That's something I really liked about this and Champloo, the characters involved find absolution, one way or another. And it's funny, because the title fits in so well with the tone of the story; A lone cowboy, returning to face his rival, one last time."
cowboybebop,36g2b8,AugustSun,2,Tue May 19 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"For Spike, it meant staying dead this time. Their roles/focus sort of correlated with how much time was spent finding their closure.   How are you so sure that he died? There's nothing confirming that he's dead. I mean, as he says ""I was killed once before, by a woman."""
cowboybebop,36g2b8,PayisInc,3,Tue May 19 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"Its up to the viewer how to look at it. There is no definitive answer on if he died, lived or was dead this whole time."

cowboybebop,36g2b8,johannthegoatman,6,Tue May 19 16:18:53 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. There's no confirmation that he died, regardless of the series ending."
cowboybebop,36g2b8,PayisInc,3,Tue May 19 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"I always thought that Spike became the head of the syndicate once he defeated Vicious. Shin does say "" I was waiting for you to come back and take over."" At least that is what it means to me."
cowboybebop,36g2b8,alanchazari,5,Tue May 19 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"After all of that, do you honestly believe Spike would take on a position like that? Spike had to have died. Nothing else would make sense, and so many things would be made pointless by such an ending.  The only even remotely valid argument for Spike living would be dream theory for the movie."

cowboybebop,36g2b8,PayisInc,4,Tue May 19 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"Although Spike dying is more poetic, I like to imagine that Jet and Faye came and picked him up soon after he collapsed (or at least the syndicate bros realized Spike's the boss now and patched him up).   Spike has survived way worse than a katana slice and a few bullets, I'm sure he could've made it."
cowboybebop,36g2b8,Russeru,0,Tue May 19 18:46:18 2015 UTC,Nah fam he dead. The creators even said it
cowboybebop,36g2b8,hornestur,5,Thu May 28 08:44:15 2015 UTC,Watanabe has refused to say whether he lived or died.
cowboybebop,36g2b8,Omnighost,2,Fri May 29 03:23:22 2015 UTC,Its heavily implied he does. There is nothing there to think otherwise. His star fades out at the end. How could he not die? We don't see anyone rush to help him when he collapses. I think Spike didn't really care if he was going to die. Julia is the reason he kept on living. Once she died he knew what he had to do
cowboybebop,36g2b8,hornestur,2,Sat May 30 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"I always thought Spike was simply biding his time on board the Bebop. He always knew that his past was too huge for him to escape it. It's like Bebop was a fallback job, and although he was pretty good at being a bounty hunter, he knew his heart always belonged to the syndicate."

cowboybebop,36b1m0,VonBrewskie,1 point,Sat May 30 10:02:06 2015 UTC,I just thought it was a bit ridiculous how Jin and Mugen managed to survive all that. And the way Jin won that samurai felt like a bit of a cop out to me.

Excellent blend of action, humor and drama. It has that dreamy quality to it like Bebop, I think. Just pulls you in and surrounds you with great characters and locations. Question: have you seen Space Dandy?"

cowboybebop,36b1m0,futbolclif,2,Tue May 19 04:44:15 2015 UTC,Ah I understand what you mean. It took me a bit to get into as well. I don't think the universe is as fleshed out as Bebop or Champloo (though there are a number of hints that it just might be in the same universe as Bebop) but the storytelling is still as strong as ever imo. A few episodes are really emotionally engaging too. The seriousness of those episodes play well against the generally goofy tone of the rest of the show.

cowboybebop,35zqdm,BobbyBobRoberts,6,Thu May 14 21:41:10 2015 UTC,"Hi guys! I guess this is as good a time as any to explain what's up with /r/CowboyBebopDeepCuts. I've been a huge fan of the show for years, and I fell in love with the music the first time I heard Tank! I used to have several Bebop-related playlists put together on Grooveshark, but when they shut down recently, I lost all of them. I had a giant list of all the released Bebop OST music, along with a lot of music that seemed related. CBDC started off as a way to reassemble those playlists.  But then I realized I was just as interested in sharing the music, and talking more about the show and music I love. Bebop has everything. Jazz, blues, rock, and it's all drawn from the cream of the crop. Plus, the more closely I examine Bebop, the more new stuff I seem to find.  So here's the current plan for the sub. First, I've gathered links to all the music (almost... I'm missing two or three songs), and it all works with Reddit Playlister, for easy listening. Second, I'm posting a weekly discussion post for individual episodes, musical influences, and the like. New music will also get added, so it all goes into the growing playlist. Finally, if there's any music that has that same Cowboy Bebop feel, come submit a link. The idea is to wind up with a larger library of Bebop-related music, a better appreciation for all the music, and more discussion of the show.  If this sounds at all interesting to you, we've got our first discussion going right now, talking about the opening credits."

cowboybebop,35s5kr,Mamertine,7,Wed May 13 01:51:15 2015 UTC,"Spike programmed the ship to land on mars by itself, they presumably were brought to a hospital there. Ed didn't get bit by the creature, so when the ship landed she could have called someone"
cowboybebop,35s5kr,punkowski,7,Wed May 13 02:21:37 2015 UTC,They died. And cowgirl Ed started her own show as the main star. Any other episode you watched was a lie.   Didn't you watch the ending after the credits?
cowboybebop,35s5kr,roninsascha,11,Thu May 14 05:30:18 2015 UTC,"Nope. Everyone is dead. The rest of the series is them having a shared hallucination in the moments before death. Either that, or it was a very short lived virus that didn't actually kill any of them. It's a tossup."
cowboybebop,35s5kr,StarPupil,3,Wed May 13 01:51:16 2015 UTC,"Watanabe regularly kills off main characters only to bring them back without explanation. Still canon, but probably best not to overthink it. I suppose Space Dandy could explain it with the multiverse theory since they're in the same universe."
cowboybebop,35s5kr,lovemyMFLB,3,Sat May 16 01:00:12 2015 UTC,Ever since I saw it as a kid I thought that episode was just an alternative universe type thing. Just a random story saying how things could have ended for the gang if Spike had left that food in the fridge. Hearing you guys say that wasn't the case make that episode much lamer.
cowboybebop,35s5kr,minTeafresh,2,Tue May 19 04:49:28 2015 UTC,"I was pretty sure this episode was non-cannon like the one with zombies of Samurai Champloo (from Watanabe too). But you guys are right, the whole Mars landing thing explains everything."

cowboybebop,35s5kr,elnelso,3,Wed May 13 11:36:11 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's canon. Punkowski got it right. There would've been no reason to show Spike programming the ship for Mars if we weren't supposed to assume that's how it ended, not to mention Ed didn't get bitten..not sure if eating it would qualify."

cowboybebop,35qw2j,JeanMarsh,10,Tue May 12 19:39:55 2015 UTC,Spike's shootout with the Mad Pierrot the amusement park is a great combination of creepiness and action so it's definitely up there for me
cowboybebop,35qw2j,TheMiddleBeast,6,Tue May 12 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"This episode has a whole ""Noir"" feel.  It's a really cool scene."
cowboybebop,35qw2j,itstimefortimmy,7,Tue May 12 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"I always mark out when Spike performs his famous floating act in ""Heavy Metal Queen.""  The badassery of jumping into the vacuum of space, course correcting yourself with your handgun, while relying on VT to be there to catch him is immeasurable."
cowboybebop,35qw2j,Sagidon,8,Wed May 13 00:40:39 2015 UTC,"The imagery and sequences from Ballad of Fallen Angels will always be a favorite of mine but one that really sticks out in my mind when I think of the series is the last conversations Spike has with Jet and Faye before he goes off to settle the score with Vicious. The story about the tiger striped cat as well as explaining to Faye how he perceives the world through his two ""different"" eyes. It's a rare scene in the series where we see the relationships between Spike & Jet and Spike & Faye highlighted explicitly."
cowboybebop,35qw2j,FringedWolf,6,Tue May 12 21:42:38 2015 UTC,"I feel my favourite scene is often under appreciated for a big reason.  It's the scene where Faye finds the ruins of her house and draws the outline before lying down where her bed used to be.  I find it's often under appreciated because it's cut together with Ed and Ein's farewell and everyone is sad about that. Don't get me wrong that is a great scene, but, the Faye scene just speaks to me more.  My personal take from(Not sure if this view is a correct one) it is that the imagary shows her small and tiny compared to the outline of her old house. She is still that small girl at heart lost in a big bad world that has changed with no obvious direction for her and no one is around that cares for her.  Personally I get goosebumps because it reminds me of moving out of home for the first time, except that daunting feeling is multiplied by 1000."

How sad the reality is, which the young boy must exist in, only being able to dream, so his dreams turned dark. Jupiter Jazz episodes, in the scenes where Fay and Gren sits in his apartment. Its something about the colors and sounds in these scenes which really speaks to me. A warm, soothing and cozy place, with a clock ticking in the background, in contrast to the cold and hard world outside his apartment."

cowboybebop,3598z2,Symbi0tic,1 point,Fri May 8 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"It's clickbait. The article contradicts itself. It says ""there will be a sequel"" and goes on to quote Shinichiro stating 'if I felt I could do better, I might make more, but I don't know when that would happen.'"
cowboybebop,3598z2,Garymalfa416,2,Sun May 10 04:13:51 2015 UTC,"Still quite exciting to hear him say that. I honestly think creators like Shinichiro can't stay away from their own work. For example,  Akira Toriyama is making an extension of DBZ, (DB Super) after a whole 18 years.  I think we'll see a lot of sequels to things we least expect sequels to in the coming years. Creators just can't stay away from their own work. Even Harry Potter's author is wanting to create more content."

cowboybebop,3531o3,Louiiiss,9,Wed May 6 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember hearing that the creators of Avatar are huge bebop fans.  Edit: Looks like bebop, among others, was a big influence for the creators.   Avatar draws inspiration from Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, as well as FLCL of Gainax... Bryan has commented that some of his most cherished Watanabe fight scenes were the fight between Bebop's Spike Spiegel and a drug smuggler in ""Asteroid Blues"""

Ed is unpredictable, creative, and has that childlike sense of fun. (Is it childlike if she is actually a child?)"
cowboybebop,3531o3,Bigfluffyltail,2,Thu May 7 00:05:48 2015 UTC,Yes this is what I was thinking. Although I could see Spike with air as well.
cowboybebop,3531o3,Radical_Ein,2,Thu May 7 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"I could also see Spike with fire because he has such a short temper. Earth is the only one I would have trouble seeing him as, but even there hes stubborn and tough.  Really he has so many character traits he would probably be the Avatar. Its one of the reasons hes such a great character. He's such a complicated character that you could argue for any of the elements.  He'd make an intersting Avatar as well. At first you wouldn't expect him to be a very good one. He seems like he doesn't care about other people, but really he just wants to hide his feelings for other people because of what happened with Julia. And there are several episodes where he helps other people over personal gain, like Waltz for Venus."

A good approach would probably be slightly rotating him so that there's more of a reference to the bangs. It would create a little cleft so that you could see where the front of the hair is, making it easier for the brain to fill in the blanks.  I really like the style though!"

Samurai Champloo is very entertaining but it's not very similar to Cowboy Bebop apart from the writing style and exciting fight scenes (still a great watch and I highly recommend it). I may be a bit biased but I think Trigun is a lot more like Cowboy Bebop. Trigun was the first anime I ever watched and it instantly drew me in. There's great character development, badass fight scenes, and very memorable dialogue and characters. It has some of the most poignant and heart-felt episodes I've seen outside of Cowboy Bebop and I couldn't recommend it more. Plus it has a great soundtrack too. :^)"

cowboybebop,34a1ba,JeanMarsh,10,Sat May 2 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"Samurai Champloo is the best and most similar from the 3 you pointed in my opinion.  Not the scenario, but the way the relationship of the characters grow and the way the music is valued in each episode."
cowboybebop,34a1ba,scorpio_2049,5,Wed Apr 29 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"Trigun's art style reminds me the most of Cowboy Bebop. I think it's because they were in the same generation of anime. The music is also reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop.  Samurai Champloo was ok, but I never got the mishmash of feudal Japan and hip-hop. And I wasn't as connected to the characters as with Bebop."
cowboybebop,34a1ba,Symbi0tic,3,Wed Apr 29 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"Music somewhat similar, maybe. Tsuneo Imahori, who made most/all of Trigun's music, was actually a part of The Seatbelts..and surely you know who The Seatbelts are."

cowboybebop,34a1ba,CalamackW,3,Wed Apr 29 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched Trigun, but between Champloo and Black Lagoon I would go with Black Lagoon any day.  Black Lagoon has some ridiculously well fleshed-out characters, whereas one of Champloo's main characters is a walking archetype, and the other two main characters are honestly rather static. (remember this is my opinion). Black Lagoon is just generally really fun to watch with a larger array of more fleshed out characters. One thing they both have in common is that the overall story exists solely to create episodic content so don't focus on it too much. (Samurai who smells like sunflowers? really? lol)"

He has a nice coat with removable parts that also spins. He has four hands, two open and two closed to hold sword / and sheat. He has his bird that attaches to his shoulder, with open and closed wing. His clothes are wonderful made, and his hair is perfect.

It just seemed so out of character to do that, Jet did a lot in that episode.  Also, a good follow-up to watching the series is a website called Jazzmess.net . It's quite old, but there's a lot of information on the sessions, the specific pieces of music used in each session, and much more."

cowboybebop,33vxtv,OldDesk,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"I have the same thoughts about Faye. Some people say that she was in love with Spike in the end of the series, but I don't believe this, it sounds stupid. What happens is that Faye don't want to let go of the only ""family"" that she ever had after awakening from her frozen state, it's really sad to see her crying after Spike leaves, I believe she translates what the spectators are feeling in the same moment. This scene is truly beautiful.  About Jet  His ending is sad too, during the sessions I kinda feel that he is afraid to be alone. He tries to act tough but real deep he never let go of his comrades, he is like a male ""tsundere"" (sorry about that XD) and in the last episode I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen to Jet and Faye.  Do you guys believe these two would continue to work together as bounty hunters? Or they would follow separated ways?"
cowboybebop,33vxtv,JeanMarsh,2,Wed Apr 29 12:48:29 2015 UTC,"I like to think that Faye and Jet stick together for at least a little while and then maybe, somewhere down the line, they split. I think that it makes sense that Faye and Jet would want to stick together after losing basically their whole team.  Then again, knowing that Faye has a tendency to run when she feels too attached, who knows? But maybe that need to run was only a part of who she was prior to her getting her memories back. Maybe the fruit that comes to bear from Faye remembering her past is that it makes her appreciate the people around her that much more. Her last interaction with Spike could suggest so.  Edit: But then... the fact that she couldn't stop Spike from leaving probably affected her, too. It could have reinforced her instinct to run and not get tied down to anyone because that has, time and again for Faye (at least the Faye that we as the audience know), led to heart break (e.g. Whitney)."
cowboybebop,33vxtv,noZemSagogo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:01:16 2015 UTC,"Faye is definitely the most tragic character. I would hesitate to try and draw a comparison between her and the viewer, I think this is a series that tries very hard to not make any one character the most relatable such that the viewer is forced into his own viewpoint.   The Ed comment..its obvious she leaves of her own accord, it is very poignant so I can understand why you want to mention it. I think if you want to reflect on that you have to go a little farther. Ed is a character that is able to take very much from very little. She was an orphan yet is able to find the joy in life, she finds endless beauty and contentment out of things the others brush off without thought. In a sense she is the strongest character. She sees straight past the lemons to the lemonade. So I think when you think about her leaving the Bebop, though it tastes very bitter, you have to keep in mind the way Ed thinks. Sure she is sad to be leaving, but much happier that she was able to have that time on Bebop at all, and she is leaving for something very important to her, its a tough decision, because she's leaving the familiar, but without a doubt shes setting off to something from which she will find just as much joy. I think of it as a very inspirational moment, its so easy to justify the familiar but Ed was able to see that she needed to move on."

cowboybebop,33tq3c,ArmadonRK,3,Sat Apr 25 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"Let's clear a few things up. Firstly, the changes you are referring to, those made in the Remix version, do not constitute ""censorship"". Officially, the series audio and video were ""remastered"". Apparently, this included minor re-cuts and changes to sound effects and score choices. No comprehensive comparison has been made so far. Symbi0tic is the one usually championing the purist version here.  Censorship, such as the editing out of a gay man, and the changing of a cannabis leaf to a peace sign, was exclusive to the Adult Swim broadcast. These were edits by Cartoon Network made for the US broadcast (discussed here), and are, to my knowledge, not on any of the home media releases. They are certainly not on my Remix DVD (I just checked) and I assume the Blu-ray, since they are the same source.  I do hope someone makes a comprehensive list of changes between versions, I would be interested in seeing that. Until then, however, I'll just say I'm in the camp of not having an issue with the Remix changes. I think the audio changes are an improvement (where they've been pointed out by others, I haven't done a thorough comparison myself), though it is a shame if scenery footage was cut.  That said, if you are a purist looking for the best viewing of the original, un-edited series, /u/Symbi0tic is the one to ask."
cowboybebop,33tq3c,ArmadonRK,2,Sun Apr 26 21:19:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Normally, I'm not an extreme purist, but for Bebop and a few other titles, I am. I appreciate the link, too. I can't for the life of me remember Jets pot leaf, Gren's scene, or Faye's encounter with the gay couple on my DVD set, but I will be checking this evening.   And my apologies on just using the term censorship, typically time cuts and re arranging happen due to the television format, so when it carries over to a home release, it kinda feels like a censorship to me even though it isn't. I just want the version that the creator and his team intended to release on the first go, I don't want someone to decide how I enjoy my media. I understand putting it on TV, time and format edits and censorship need to be made, and that's fine, but when you release it to the public for use in their private home, it needs to be un touched. No edit, no censorship, no shitty filters you think make it look better, just leave it alone.  I think 4Kids has made me an asshole when it comes to anime and I apologize."
cowboybebop,33tq3c,Symbi0tic,3,Sun Apr 26 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"No apology necessary, the series was censored at a time as you described, I just wanted to clarify that the Remix set, while re-edited, did not include the censored changes you mentioned - those changes were made, but separately, for a specific broadcast.  As for the version the creator intended, that's a tougher question, I think, than just the original release. Director's Cuts, Extended Cuts, George Lucas Cuts; more often than not, you can really only choose the cut you feel best represents the work.  Not having seen the entire series as originally broadcast (the Perfect Sessions) I can't say for sure which is the better representation. The Remix was marketed as remastered ""under Watanabe's supervision"", though who can say whether or not that's accurate? For me, it's things like the change of music in the final episode preview that make me consider that the changes were made with careful consideration. Though the argument could be made that the new track doesn't fit the mood, I've always argued that Farewell Blues, being closely tied to Jet and his resolved arc, was a thematically dissonant chose of score. The replacement, however, ties it into Jupiter Jazz's themes, and Spike's arc more honestly, and the rhythmic, bass-driven tune suits the almost beat-poem style voice-over much better.  Not to say that it makes it the superior version, just a personal preference in terms of tone and thematic continuity. There's merit in considering the original to be truer to the original vision, as well. I suppose what I'm saying is, I don't know that there is a definitive version of Cowboy Bebop. Pursue and prefer the one you think is best."
cowboybebop,33tq3c,Jhppy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:10:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you're going for the original, unedited releases with optional English subtitles and both Japanese & English audio, you're looking at the original North American DVD releases by Bandai. Six volume set, released individually and as a part of a limited edition set called ""The Perfect Sessions.""  These original DVDs seem to be dropping in price on eBay for some reason, so it's likely you can pick them up for relatively cheap. I'd imagine this is because many people are either unaware of the differences, or they just don't care.  Cheapest I see on eBay right now is this. Unsure of the physical quality, but it's listed as ""Good"", which by eBay definition is not really that ""good."" Also two, three, four, and the original limited edition box set with the included soundtrack.  Edit: I don't believe any changes were made for the movie. But any official English release after the Bandai ones I just linked you all use the Remix edits, unfortunately."

cowboybebop,33tq3c,BCap1,2,Mon Apr 27 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"I'll copy/paste a list of changes that /u/Symbi0tic kindly put together on another post:    Removal of entire scenes, albeit mostly scenery. (Prime example: The beginning of Session 5 has 30 seconds of footage completely cut.) The entire series has went through a brightening filter, washing out colors. Sound effects have been completely changed in various places, not enhanced. (Example: The gunshot at the end of Session 1 doesn't even sound like a gunshot anymore, and it seems like the sound effect gets cut off before it even finishes. Ambience has also been completely removed from space scenes.) Songs have been replaced in certain places. (Example: The next episode preview at the end of Episode 25 now has upbeat music that was used in Jupiter Jazz Part I's eyecatch on repeat rather than the depressing ""Farewell Blues"" that actually fits the dialogue and mood.) Some songs start/stop at different times, while complete portions of some songs have been removed from scenes (most notably ""Blue"" from the final episode, as the choir ends and the doves fly by)."

cowboybebop,33tq3c,BCap1,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"A lot actually. Lots of small things like some sounds being changed and content like cannabis leaf on hippie Jets shirt being turned into a peace sign. But then a couple of big things like song adjustments and actual cut content. That's just the tip of the iceberg and from my research, all versions are like this except the original separate 6 session dvd's."

I loved the orange sky at he ending and the one with the French assassin freak where they fight in the theme park is my favorite episode. The scene where he is crying and there is the creepy theme park music playing with the parade of robot animals was so dark and intense but amazing.

cowboybebop,32wmj5,Oliverz5,3,Fri Apr 17 09:19:39 2015 UTC,I would advise you not to search Cowboy Bebop-related things on YouTube until you've seen the series. I had certain key parts of the story spoiled simply by the titles of suggested videos.

cowboybebop,32v7lg,CrayolaBrown,1 point,Fri Apr 17 07:39:12 2015 UTC,Can you find pictures of it? I'm curious to see it.
cowboybebop,32vrtd,OBMSIA,37,Fri Apr 17 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"The perspective of the camera is that of the red dragon syndicate goons. Spike is pretty injured, out of weapons and just fought his way through the most heavily armed and organized crime syndicate in the galaxy single handedly and killed the syndicate leader. As he limps down the staircase towards the goons he finds humour in this and raises his hand like a gun and says bang to mock them. it's funny, brash, and very smooth just like spike.   That's my interpretation anyway."
cowboybebop,32vrtd,Flintlox,8,Fri Apr 17 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"It's a callback to his line in Session 6, Sympathy for the Devil.   Though, I think it's just supposed to be smartass, badass and cool, characteristics that pretty much define Spike Spiegel. The final scene is beautifully composed. As he limps downstairs, the audience is meant to question what his next move is. He's completely surrounded. Everyone holds their collective breaths... then he says it and collapses. The ending is perfect."
cowboybebop,32vrtd,janoo1989,9,Fri Apr 17 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"Aside from ""going out with a bang,"" and that he was in fact ""aiming"" at the remaining syndicate members, it is indeed mostly a reference to the ending of Session 6, Sympathy for the Devil, as Janoo mentioned.  However, there's more to it than that. It's important because of Wen's words, and Spike's response, just before Spike tosses the harmonica in the air and says the word.   Wen: I see. Yes, I can finally die at last. I feel so heavy, but I feel..I finally feel at ease. Do you understand? Do you understand? Do you?  Spike: Yeah, I understand. As if.  (Spike tosses the harmonica into the air and raises his hand like a gun, aiming at it)  Spike: Bang.   It's clear that Spike remembers this moment as he's dying because he does, finally, understand. Furthermore, I'd say this just reinforces that Spike did in fact die."
cowboybebop,32vrtd,Symbi0tic,2,Fri Apr 17 07:10:11 2015 UTC,"I knew I'd seen it, but I forgot where it was. A bit of me thought I was crossing wires with the scene in MGS4 where liquid says bang. Thanks"

cowboybebop,32vrtd,salty_d0ge,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"I always kinda figured it was a jab at the remainder of the syndicate. As if to say ""I just cut the head off of the snake, the body is sure to die"". At that point, killing Spike held zero bearing on whether or not the syndicate would hold together for the long run. In the end, Spike gets the last laugh against an organization that has tormented his past and been a demon in his mind for so long."

Of course Cowboy Bebop is better than Code Geass, but it's always quantity over quality with these, and honestly, Bebop garners a lot of interest from people that aren't very into anime in general.  Besides, ""the work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called...COWBOY BEBOP."""

cowboybebop,32lzzu,Zywakem,3,Tue Apr 14 22:47:19 2015 UTC,This was the major gripe I had with the show. I liked it but the whole time felt like lelouch was a shitty light.

Seriously, 8.9/10 for Code Geass, 8.3 for Neon Genesis Evangelion, 7.8 for InuYasha... hell, even Pilot Candidate, the worst anime [adult swim] ever pinched out got a 6.6/10."
cowboybebop,32lzzu,RetroFan89,2,Tue Apr 14 23:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's a pretty good show to lose to. In terms of favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop is number 2 on my list. Code geass is somewhere lower. But that's all personal preference.   I don't have any major problems with Code Geass. Sure it is popular, so there will be a lot of people who think its ""hype"" is undeserved. But I think it has a well crafted, well written story with a brilliant conclusion and an entertaining plot. It might drag a bit during the start of R2. But what's there was still pretty good.   All in all, I don't think we should go around raging about /r/anime having terrible taste. This is the Cowboy Bebop subreddit. We're much better than that. I'd be a lot more upset if FMA:B won over Cowboy Bebop. But that's just because of my distain for remakes."
cowboybebop,32lzzu,twinfyre,2,Wed Apr 15 05:49:48 2015 UTC,"Code Geass is more popular among /r/anime (mostly due to a younger userbase that might not have seen an ""old"" show like Bebop).   That's honestly why it won. Nothing more, and nothing less.   Its a popularity contest. What has been seen automatically trumps the unknown.   But if we need to argue over /r/anime's terrible taste, I could find much better examples than Geass.   Edit: I have to correct you. FMA Brotherhood isn't a remake. Its the proper manga plotline the original tossed because they ran out of official content."
cowboybebop,32lzzu,Error400BadRequest,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:31:10 2015 UTC,That's one of the reasons I don't like it so much. It was closer to the manga so a lot of people think that that makes it better.

cowboybebop,32lzzu,twinfyre,2,Wed Apr 15 17:59:48 2015 UTC,The whole show was episodic and can't be compared to FMA's overarching plot.   The 2003 FMA deviated from the plot of the manga and it only resulted in a less elegantly told story in favour of filler episodes.
cowboybebop,32lzzu,DocTavia,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"FMA 2003 started out as an episodic show, but it slowly developed an overarching plot.

cowboybebop,329y42,NoNormals,10,Sat Apr 11 22:53:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the recs! I'll definitely check these out- I need something by the same director, because I feel like nothing else is going to live up to it right now haha.  I watched the movie as well! I ordered it a few days ago and just watched it yesterday (thank god for Amazon prime), between episodes 22 and 23."
cowboybebop,329y42,NoNormals,5,Sat Apr 11 23:01:27 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  Finishing it is such a wonderfully strange feeling; you want more, but a part of you knows that even if there was a sequel, it would only disappoint. If the live action movie ever comes out of developmental hell I wouldn't know how to react."
cowboybebop,329y42,NoNormals,2,Sat Apr 11 23:16:09 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely. I don't think a sequel could live up to it. I did see a suggestion about a prequel which might be interesting, but even then I'm not sure whether it would be best to leave it as is."
cowboybebop,329y42,salty_d0ge,5,Sat Apr 11 23:40:53 2015 UTC,"A prequel would be very cool, they could flesh out a lot of the mysterious backgrounds. I can see the 'old' dudes building the gateway, flashed forward to young Jet with his buddy cop probably with crazy hair and later Vicious, Spike and Julia hanging out.   However that would require good writing, at least enough that the foreshadowing and dramatic irony isn't too obvious. Plus landing the voice actors."
cowboybebop,329y42,rainbowtunnel,5,Sun Apr 12 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"The Cowboy Bebop movie, in my opinion, is an absolute masterpiece. That is my go-to movie when I want a quintessential slice of 90's culture/music, and not to mention a superb story line."
cowboybebop,329y42,MrMooseyMoosington,3,Sun Apr 12 01:22:41 2015 UTC,"Also ""Kids on the Slope"", directed by the same dude, about kids playing jazz in high school (in Japan of course). It was a little too high-school-drama-y for my taste, but Yoko Kanno did the music so it was worth it."
cowboybebop,329y42,dr_mojo,2,Sun Apr 12 05:47:58 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the recommendation! I've gotta make a list of these

It's known for its use in the ""Mish-Mash Blues"" session (episode) of Cowboy Bebop, often referred to as 13.5 or ""Session XX"", I believe. Artist is Tsutchie and the song itself is entitled ""Tokyo Tower."" Its only release was in 1996 on the ""Get A Point"" vinyl record. Catalog number of GAP-002 for Get A Point Entertainment.  I'd post a link to purchase, but this record is extremely rare. I was lucky to find it on a Japanese website and have it purchased and shipped to me in the United States by a third party.  I know some people on this subreddit have been waiting for this for over a month now. Those of you that are interested, I'll be adding the rest of the record (7 songs) at a later date!"

Ginseng, sugar cane, and/or pineapple soda and a good Lao Chu (Chinese Wine) for you and the lady, and Peking Duck, Session 2  Probably want a break after the Duck so: Cherry Candies and alcohol of your choice. Cheers Jet! Session 3  Lobster Miso Stew with Rice, and/or Rat if you really want to make that work (not nearly as bad as you'd expect, but still kinda bad), Session 4  I'd go for something bitter tasting, paired with something a little sour. This one is really tough. Session 5 (I originally put Grenades and Stained Glass)  Wet Dog Food... Faye... , and Sweet, Sweet Desserts! Yum! Session 6  Strawberry and Banana Sundae, Bean Sprouts and a Prairie Oyster: a raw egg unbroken, a teaspoon of Worcestershire Sauce, salt, pepper, and 2 dashes of Tobasco. It's totally not as disgusting as you'd think. Session 7  Water and Sunflower (or another kind of) Seeds. Bonus: will wash down with the Prarie Oyster pretty well. Session 8  Peeps! Session 9  Whiskey on rocks, Session 10  Lobster or Lobster Tails, Session 11  More Whiskey and your girlfriend, ;) Session 12  Rations or an equivalent, Bloody Marys, maybe your girlfriend again XD, Session 13  Sessions 12 and 13 are tough like 5 is.

cowboybebop,31k6jz,colgato,12,Sun Apr 5 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"I think 26 episodes is perfect, not too many, but not too little. The problem is there isn't much in the way of a plot (other than the overarching story of Spike, which only starts properly halfway through), so it feels like there may be quite a few filler episodes, which makes the series feel short. I think if it was double the episodes, or went any longer, Bebop would lose some of the 'coolness' about it, we may end up watching it for the sake of watching it (anime get really boring really quickly if they don't look like they have an end in sight :/). There is room for more episodes though, but over 10 years later? Maybe not, I've already seen some of my favourite TV shows (namely, Thunderbirds) butchered by reboots many years after they originally aired."
cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,2,Sun Apr 5 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't actually know how to split paragraphs in comments XD"
cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,3,Sun Apr 5 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"It's fine man, haha.  And yeah, there is no real STORY, but there is a common theme in the majority of every episode: character development. The only instances i can recall no development at all for any of the main 4 are episodes 4, 6, 7, 11, 14, 17, and 23. The rest of the series has medium to large development, which is why i think new episodes could fail, unless they kept up a decent amount of development. But at the same time, i still wish i could have seen more of the everyday lives of the bebop crew. Also, this is more hypothetical than anything, id rather them not make new episodes so far ahead, but rather im thinking about what if when it was still airing there were this many episodes. Themes i feel like could have been explored are Spike and Ed's relationship working together, Ed spends more time with Jet and Faye on screen than she does with Spike, so that's something i would have loved to see.  And yeah, reboots suck haha"
cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,4,Sun Apr 5 22:32:09 2015 UTC,"I was focusing so much on plot I forgot about character development! That's very embarrassing... Actually that's a good point, just anymore episodes of how they work and interact would be great, and to see the Solar System they live in too. Why Spike is never around Ed? Something about children, animals, and women being his least favourite things. I felt we could have seen some more of Ed though, she didn't really do much in chasing bounties at all."
cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,5,Sun Apr 5 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"She did help a lot though, in terms of tracking down the people they were after. And honestly, i'm sure behind the scenes Spike and Ed were close, I just wish it could have been shown. The majority of scenes with Spike and Ed is just Spike being annoyed or confused by her. Episode 11 is one of their few interactions where Spike seems to understand her well, when discussing what could have bit Jet. And yeah, they were a few planets yet to explore in the series that would have been neat to see. And maybe there could have even been an episode about Spike and Lin, as Lin had very little purpose in the 2 episodes he was in, and Shin almost felt shoehorned in at the end. Shin/Lin could have been one character who appeared in 5 episodes, 12-13. 25-26, and another episode that could have shown spike and Shin/Lin's relationship in the syndicate days. There really feels like a decent amount of possibility left unexplored. I truly feel like there could have been a lot more to show, but like i said, I also fear that it could have taken away from it's overall greatness."
cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,3,Sun Apr 5 22:51:30 2015 UTC,Oooh how about a prequel series of Spike and Vicious?
cowboybebop,31k6jz,MoarStruts,3,Sun Apr 5 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"nah, like i was saying earlier, all hypothetical. I agree with you're earlier comment and was thinking the same before it, it's too late and would be odd to expand on the series now. I'm a big fan of ""what-if?"" situations which is exactly why I made this thread. Sorry if i see i'm being rude though, I just gotta disagree on this one, a single syndicate episode would have been nice just to see what it was like though."
cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,2,Sun Apr 5 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah no problem, I think I was just spitballing, it'd definitely be a way to make a new series, but do we really want a new series after so long? Probably not, it definitely won't be the same."

cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"The series definitely has spinoff potential, and it doesn't even have to focus on the crew of the Bebop. Think of all the different people encountered in the show, all the different locations featured... There's so much room for expansion in those areas without interfering with the original series."
cowboybebop,31k6jz,Zywakem,2,Sat Apr 11 09:53:24 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd want to see more of the Solar System and the many different places and people, I think it just wouldn't be the same without the original crew. Unless they didn't make it so serious, so it wouldn't look like 'Cowboy Bebop: same stuff, different characters'"

It didn't get released until the soundtrack for the movie came out.  I remember that as soon as I got the movie soundtrack and heard the female vocal version on the CD, I immediately ran up to my friends work, he worked at Radio Shack, and said listen to this and threw the disk in the working display CD player hooked up the big display speakers.  It was glorious."

The one from the album Cowboy Bebop (1998) came first, and was sang by Steve Conte.   Interestingly, the version in the show itself is in the episode ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"", and is the Mai Yamane version. So all things considered, the female version is technically the original, though it is a bit unclear which was made first."

There is no market impetus driving innovation forward in spaceflight nor do we have any destinations for the public off Earth.

I figure we should be getting to that point with space flight once spaceflight starts to get to being more profitable GDP wise in the private sector than in the public sector. And we should be getting a working fusion reactor within 20 years or so. That would help significantly with the dv requirements for spaceflight.

cowboybebop,303usy,CharlesDingus,18,Tue Mar 24 06:34:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Vicious was always THIS cold. Well,sure,he was very ruthless in the syndicate and all,but he loved. He loved Julia. He loved Spike,as a friend. Possibly respected some other syndicate people too.  Then he got betrayed by the only people he cared for,and learned that there is nothing to believe in this cold world. He stopped believing in friendship and loyalty,he only started caring for himself and power. I think he is more closer to Spike than we suppose. I really doubt he is full of life and wants to live to his 80's. Maybe he's living in a dream or a purgatory too,like Spike and Vincent.  Actually,I've always seen Vincent as a combination of Spike and Vicious. He was ruthless as Vicious,but living in a dream-state as Spike. All three of them have similar pasts - betrayal. All three of them are looking for a purpose,and Vicious has a reason to be a cold bitch (besides being a sociopath,lololo).  Nothing happens without a reason. People just don't become corrupted for no reason,there has to be something to start that process."
cowboybebop,303usy,FrjutMarakuja,5,Tue Mar 24 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"There is that one scene that they flashback to occasionally where he's in a shootout with Spike and he smiles at him. That always weirded me out a little; it reminded me of seeing someone you know to be gentle and kind suddenly turn all angry. You know, seeing a side of them that you didn't know they had. So yeah, there was a time where Vicious wasn't screwed up, but it's such a foreign concept to us that seeing him be something other than cold and uncaring, even for a second, can be downright unsettling. It's unclear exactly how he got to be the way he is (Spike taking Julia from him, a bloody eye addiction, the intensity of mob life being too much, etc.), but does it really matter in the grand scheme of things? That person who was all smiles and friendliness is long gone, and he's not coming back."

Lin wasn't protecting Vicious because he liked Vicious, it was because it was his duty as a syndicate member.

cowboybebop,303usy,30cuts,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I just kind of figured that he was personally loyal towards Vicious over the Van since they're both competitors and I can't imagine the Van cared too much about Vicious's life.

cowboybebop,303usy,Zywakem,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"Actually if you think about it, as Lin was just a side character in the whole syndicate, maybe Vicious was saving him in the long run from the fallout of his coup later? Lin did what he did because of his sincere determination to the Van, which would mean eventually he would have to die later. Vicious was saving him from that, and from having the internal conflict of either following Vicious (as he showed he was fiercely loyal to Vicious too) or staying true."
cowboybebop,303usy,lyzabit,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:15:09 2015 UTC,"I'd always wondered if he wasn't disgusted that Lin died for someone else's beliefs about what was right and proper conduct, not necessarily that he died for his own beliefs--and Lin said flat out that he was doing it because it was the will of the Van."

Spike messes around with Julia behind his back, not only does Vicious lose his best friend but he can't trust his girl. Huge rift.  Depending on the type of person he was, which we don't know much about that, such a situation could definitely eat away. He believed in something, obviously, and he paid a price.

Because, in part, I can really identify with him in those aspects. I'm no spacecowboy without cares, obviously, but besides some basic shit in life I can't really be bothered by much. I just go about my business and don't really mind anyone elses.  Also, I'm just content with being alone. And, besides Spikes way of life, the entire show just perfectly grasps that feeling for me. Besides being able to identify with some characters or some of the actions that they make; with Cowboy Bebop I can identify with the show as a whole. The music, the athmosphere, the easy environment it paints in the backgrounds; it all fits for me, it justs grabs me from start to finish every episode again.  And then there is the movie, it's a bit more upbeat, imho, and has some more spice; which is a nice alternative to the show. But it still has that key feature that all of Bebop has, that behind all the upbeat fighting scenes, there is still a story. It's about being the only one like you (which is essentialy true for everyone, but in case of Bebop it mostly goes for the introverts among us), and being content with being alone in the way you see and experience the world. With knowing that only you see the world the way you see it, that only you live in the world you live in and everyone else just rolls along in it.  Are you living in the real world?"

I felt at home watching it, because it was episodic, and up to that point that's primarily what I watched (shows like Adventure Time) so it felt just as natural as watching a continuously flowing series like most anime is.   As for the series, I loved pretty much everything about it. It was a suspenseful series, without having to be incredibly action packed and in your face with the fight scenes. The characters, obviously are what made the series, Spike with his laid back cool attitude, Faye meeting his attitude with her abrasive attitude, Jet being the in between, and Ed... simply being Ed. The art style was fantastic, the settings were fun and original, and it all came together to make an unforgettable experience that I could watch again and again.

This was from watching episodes out of order on Adult Swim back in the day, so I had no idea about the full story arc. I picked up a set of DVDs on eBay and watched the whole series in order.

Also it's one of the few maybe only amines that was really designed for the sub and not the original jap language! The English version is actually the better acted and written.

When she saw that one she asked me what it was from, I told her my favorite show, and then she asked if I was going to like the show in ten years--and when I told her it was Cowboy Bebop, she just looked at me and said 'Oh, well. Never mind.'  The show resonates with me and always has, although I might be hard-pressed to write an essay about it...I first watched it when I was young and liked it because it was cool. There was something about the atmosphere and the characters that struck me. Then, the older I get, the more I like that I can look deeper into the show, into the individual episodes and instances I might not have appreciated much as a kid, and still continuously find new things to appreciate or think about.  Then there's the uncomfortable part, where some shit I went through (and still haven't quite recovered from) bore more than a passing resemblance to a major plot point, leaving me in the position of the adversary in the show...and it's left me with some seriously non-standard ways of looking at life and people in general.  This seems like it was all over the place. Oh, well. The show has been a part of my life for so long it's very hard to think of what first drew me in."

As friends came over to hang out, we'd show them the show as well and pretty much everyone I knew fell in love with the show just as I did and for the same reasons.  I never actually owned anything but the first DVD, but I had multiple other friend who purchased all the discs as they were release, so I managed to see the entire show many times over long before it ever aired on Adult Swim.

Had it been dragged out, Spike would've been running around with Julia for quite a while, and having him meet her again then kill her off was so perfect, showing how things can be taken in a split second.  Vicious had been planning to overthrow the Elders for quite a while, and this is where he did it. Spike knew his past was catching up to him. This is where it happens.  I really do not understand how you expect this to have been dragged out more."

cowboybebop,2zaxst,Xune531,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:38:23 2015 UTC,I feel like the best thing you could do is make a film that takes place in the universe but has a brand new plot and characters- maybe make some references to the crazy syndicate fight that happened a few years back. Or have it star Andy.

You could toss around potential casts from now til the gates open back up and it wouldn't matter, as they're never going to fit everyone's view of ""oh, yes, absolutely, that's a PERFECT so-and-so"". Truth told, you wouldn't even be able to get the voices right - and think of how important those character voices are to those characters?  And if you can't come up with a befitting cast, then why bother?"

cowboybebop,2zaxst,WheelsofFire,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:24:29 2015 UTC,"So much negativity arises when people mention live action adaptations of anime. To you, I say boo. Learn to give things a chance. Okay, so DBE was a mess, but that doesn't mean other things have to be a mess. Yes, the world of animation does things that we can't do that well with CGI in a live action show/movie. I think I feel a sense of racial prejudice when people put down live action adaptations of anime. Nobody said they were all Japanese characters. I mean, we're looking at people who live in space. I do think some actors/actresses today could fit the roles of the characters if they tried. I think Bruce Willis would be an excellent Jet. I did once see that they were planning to cast Dakota Fanning as Ed. Now to that, I say no. Maybe Johnny Depp as Spike? I can totally see it working, as opposed to Keanu Reeves, another person that I saw that was a planned cast member for a supposed live action CB movie. Not sure who would be a good Faye, though. I have given this a lot of thought, as well as casts for other live action movies. So if we are lucky, they will know what they're doing and they will do pretty well. But for now, we got the anime. And the anime is enough."

cowboybebop,2zaxst,joedapper,0,Tue Mar 17 11:19:42 2015 UTC,"That is the most superficial metric by which you can possibly judge this question.   Yeah he recreated several panels, whoop-de-fuckin doo. But he completely changed the tone of the piece. It was like watching a shitty James Bond film at points."
cowboybebop,2zaxst,joedapper,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're forgetting that Watchmen is virtually un-adaptable. Snyder did what he could and stayed as true as possible. You're one of those guys who just cannot get past the fact that the graphic novel is one thing, and the film is another, so the only way possible you can judge the film is by comparing it to the graphic novel. Try and look at the film only as a film, not as a film adaption."
cowboybebop,2zaxst,HangMeDry,0,Tue Mar 17 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"This question tears me apart. Yes, I want to see a solid 2 hours of action packed bounty hunting goodness. NO, I do not want to see Hollywood assholes collecting pay checks by turning in horrible performances of the characters I love so much. That being said. I think Tarantino is the only man who can bring such an endeavor to life. Even if it kinda gets told out of order."
cowboybebop,2zaxst,HangMeDry,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree with your director choice. Tarantino would turn Bebop into a dialogue driven piece instead of being so rich in visuals, like the anime is known for.  I'm really wondering why people think just because someone is a great director, they are good for any particular dream picture. I've heard people recommend not only Tarantino for a Bebop film, but Nolan, P.T. Anderson, and a bunch of other random good directors.  The only one I can see doing this right now is Rian Johnson. He's a huge Bebop fan and he's already directed very Bebop-ish pictures."
cowboybebop,2zaxst,HangMeDry,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"I just figured he could express the gritty realism. He's done syndicate type stuff, and gangsters, and action - all things bebop has. Lets also not forget Tarantino movies have great sound tracks. While they'd be fools to not just have the Seatbelts do all the music, you know they'll have to hollywood it up.  While I agree with you on the visuals, that stuff will be up to the CG team anyhow. I really dont care who they get if it ever happens. Just so long as they do it well. Don't make a mockery of the best anime ever."

I remember thinking a little about her perspective at the end, but I should rethink it.

Though, no matter how much I wish Spike was alive, I think that's the only way the ending could be perfect. It's his story. And his story ends right there. If it was supposed to be that he lived and it ended like that, it wouldn't be as amazing as it was, at least to me. There would've been no closure with Spike. He would've been alive, and we would've known absolutely nothing that happened afterwards. With him dying, while it's even more sad, we at least know he had found peace. His struggle was finally over, and he knew he's been alive all this time.  That's not saying I don't wish there was at least some detail on what everyone's doing afterwards. Though, I like to think that Jet and Faye most likely repaired the Bebop and left Mars, continuing on butting heads and hunting bounties, not talking about Spike and just accepting that he LEFT the Bebop. They'd probably think that he was just out there somewhere and might return. Of course knowing in the back of their heads that he died. Anything more than that just doesn't feel right. At least to me."

They also left it somewhat ambiguous and just fading out, leaving it up to your imagination and clues.  Closure for Jet came with moving on from the past(girlfriend) and dealing with his old partner FAD, and he survived. I don't think it's impossible to imagine, that since dealing with Spikes past they'd just fade out and let you decide."

cowboybebop,2ylhwg,MmmmmKittens,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"I know that, I'm talking about the details, the ratio, and such.  Are there parts missing in the iTunes digital version versus the originally aired version?  Does it have both dub, and subtitles? That sort of info."
cowboybebop,2ylhwg,MmmmmKittens,2,Wed Mar 11 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it's in HD (or SD if you pick that version), and uses the same edits as the recent blu-ray release (not quite as bad as the remixes, but not perfection like the original broadcast; essentially unnoticable). Unfortunately, there is no Japanese audio. Because it was released alongside the Blu-ray release, my guess is that it uses the original 4:3 aspect ratio. There are subtitles that match up with the English dub, however, which you won't find anywhere else."

Even if it's not canonically what Spike was thinking/feeling and why, it sounds like it's based on a really strong grasp of the character and the story, and it's clear that it really touched you, which is what he wanted.   If nothing else, thanks for giving me some food for thought. I'm gonna keep this in mind on my next re-watch.  ...life is but a dream"

Whenever this debate comes up, I've seen a number of people claim that Shinichiro Watanabe himself prefers the dub over the sub, but I can't seem to find any source on that.  I was wondering if anyone has a link."

cowboybebop,2xz74k,Slapdash_Scott,4,Thu Mar 5 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"I prefer the dub for Steve Blum. I would also suggest it because it was one of the first dubs considered to be really, really good, and encouraged more dubbing in the future. If you usually watch subs though, go with that."

cowboybebop,2xz74k,Thedamned22,2,Tue Mar 10 23:47:14 2015 UTC,DUB!  Cowboy Bebop is the exception to most anime conventional knowledge.
cowboybebop,2xz74k,KoshekhTheCat,2,Thu Mar 12 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"Cowboy Bebop is one of the few anime's where you cannot go wrong with either one. I prefer the dub myself because they got together, what seemed to me, to be the absolute perfect matches for each of the main characters. You felt their personalities through their voices as much as their actions. When any anime show can do that, you will always have a winner in my book."

I also think the list shows another very strong point regrading just how good the Cowboy Bebop OST is: you could replace almost any of these songs with others from the show and it would still be an incredible list.

I've actually created sheet music by ear for Memory, and I'd be happy to share it with you.

When I was younger, anything past 11pm was a mysterious time, so catching Cowboy Bebop one lucky night was amazing. It was the secret show that only I knew about. I learned to program our VCR to record it. Then I'd watch it after school the next day, thinking I had found a way to conquer that mysterious time and watch a post-midnight show (or whenever it was on) during the day."

The real beauty of this is with bebops soundtrack through the whole series. every once in awhile the music while kick up at perfect tkming to the world around you and you really get the feeling of being a space vowboy, wandering from one place to the next."

A large mug of hot tea in your hands and a bowl of special beef and bell peppers and rice in your lap.   Best way to watch them is to get the Blu Rays or failing that, downloading them. Dub or sub, it's an excellent way to spend a few hours."
cowboybebop,2wqsir,sops-sierra-19,9,Sun Feb 22 14:28:34 2015 UTC,"At home with the lights turned off.  If you cant find it (if youre in aus I can help you out) then Id say youre better off downloading than streaming. IIRC theres a guy who seeds a torrent of the original (no song changes, colour touch ups, etc.) but youll have to search the sub for it. I went on watchcartoonsonline for the movie, hope you have ad block for that place"
cowboybebop,2wqsir,Mr_Flippers,7,Sun Feb 22 11:34:59 2015 UTC,"Get the bluray if you can, it's worth it."

cowboybebop,2wqsir,twinfyre,3,Sun Feb 22 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you download it, this masterpiece is at its best in HD. You can watch it online at animefreak.com or maybe http://anilinkz.com/ has it. Or if available in your country; you could buy it.  There is only one season of CB plus a movie."
cowboybebop,2wqsir,Sknator,7,Sun Feb 22 08:09:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I'll look into buying it.
cowboybebop,2wqsir,Symbi0tic,1 point,Sun Feb 22 08:52:38 2015 UTC,Download the original release of the series and avoid the remix (blu-ray included). Then purchase the original version of the series via eBay/Amazon or somewhere similar.
cowboybebop,2wqsir,billycoolj,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:33:18 2015 UTC,"I don't have the original release, but is it time I get it? Just how much more does that release improve the Bebop experience?"
cowboybebop,2wqsir,Symbi0tic,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, thought I responded to this. It all depends on what's more important to you. The only possible reasons to get the Remix (including the blu-ray) over the original release would be convenience, the 5.1 audio, the resolution, and ""clean"" picture. If you're overly anal about those things and don't care about how many unnecessary/bad decisions were made in the process, perhaps the Remix/Blu-ray is for you.  I made a thread ages ago discussing some of the differences. Check it out.  http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/29jk10/read_me_cowboy_bebops_complete_original_release/"

cowboybebop,2wqsir,OnlyEpic,1 point,Mon Feb 23 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"Remember guys, it's kind of hurting the creators if you watch and share something without paying money for it. It's more ethical to watch it on Crunchyroll or something."
cowboybebop,2wqsir,noZemSagogo,2,Sat Feb 28 05:32:11 2015 UTC,they're not really making money or hoping to make money off an anime that came out in the 90s. Especially not in the states. Were simply not the target audience and our purchase has little effect. Maybe someone can link an article on anime economics. edit: instead of the states i should say anywhere outside of japan

cowboybebop,2wm6l6,MoarStruts,1 point,Mon Feb 23 10:20:01 2015 UTC,I only have the series on DVD :(
cowboybebop,2wm6l6,FringedWolf,15,Mon Feb 23 14:30:21 2015 UTC,"If you give mysterious/interesting characters a backstory, they usually stop being mysterious/interesting. I like knowing that Vicious and Spike are mortal elements and we all speculate it's over Julia or perhaps Spike leaving the syndicate. However we don't really know, and Bebop just works this way. Vicious is a scary villain in the eyes of the Bebop crew and it's good that we know little of him or else that takes a lot from his character. The same with Julia being all noir and shit. Spike and Jet are both interesting characters because they were able to one day decide to leave the syndicate/police. We just don't know the details."
cowboybebop,2wm6l6,Bloody_Heartland,2,Sat Feb 21 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"You have a good point, cowboy."
cowboybebop,2wm6l6,PictureofPoritrin,6,Sat Feb 21 22:58:32 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, I'll pass.  We got as much story as we need to appreciate the thing.  Tired of reboots, revisitations, reimaginings, prequels, sequels, and training montages.  Younger me wanted more.  Older me appreciates what we do have."
cowboybebop,2wm6l6,ludonarrator,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"You have a good point, cowboy."
cowboybebop,2wm6l6,MoarStruts,3,Sat Feb 21 22:58:36 2015 UTC,I think more Bebop is not a good idea. In any case soon a Soni/Hollywoody production is going to buy rights and reboot it as an effing superhero movie anyway.
cowboybebop,2wm6l6,BCap1,2,Sat Feb 21 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"If I had the drawing/writing ability and the willpower I'd make a comic featuring Ed and Ein after they leave the Bebop, exploring Ed's backstory and linking to the manga. Maybe she meets up with Tomato?   I think there's room for fanmade works but I think canon sequels/prequels/spinoffs aren't necessarily a good idea."
cowboybebop,2wkc90,tranypanda,6,Fri Feb 20 17:11:26 2015 UTC,Steven Blum has such an epic voice... ever since I watched Cowboy Bebop!
cowboybebop,2wkc90,ShadowKing94,5,Fri Feb 20 17:52:54 2015 UTC,He voices Mugen from Samurai Champloo as well. Same creators as bebop I believe
