PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,Witthoeft,31,Tue Jul 21 17:32:37 2015 UTC,She looks stunning. But why is it YELLOW?? No more yellow clothes on this show please!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,Eddy1504,14,Tue Jul 21 17:34:56 2015 UTC,You know they did that on purpose to drive us crazy.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,jaderosewood,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:36 2015 UTC,Let's hope Melissa won't bury someone by accident!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,Eddy1504,2,Tue Jul 21 20:43:52 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing!! I'm guessing yellow is a theme or message of some sort.   Perhaps the conflicting meanings behind the color represent some theme or some character here.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,astrokey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:16 2015 UTC,It's our sign that shit's going down.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,selene623,26,Tue Jul 21 20:31:33 2015 UTC,Alison DIVAurentis.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,jaderosewood,32,Tue Jul 21 17:42:03 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've noticed her weight gain since they've been hiding her body. Now I'm sort of angry. She looks awesome, why are they trying so hard to cover her up?"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,lalalalarn,12,Tue Jul 21 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been saying this whole time! Yeah, she gained a bit of weight but she's so gorgeous! They need to show her off! She's a teenager but they got her one bad haircut away from being the ""I want to talk to your manager!"" soccer mom."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,polishandpowders,9,Tue Jul 21 19:01:19 2015 UTC,I totally agree. She doesn't look fat at all. She looks normal why must they cover her up only because she isn't a freaking stick. Women are beautiful no matter the weight as long as they are healthy. She is beautiful and looks gorgeous I hate the media for making it seem like if you are not a size 2 you need to be ashamed and cover up.   Also to the people that bash her because of her weight get a life!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,Rosewoodsfinest,2,Tue Jul 21 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"(This is not bashing you in any way at all btw)   I also hate society for making it seem like if you are a size 2 you're not a 'real woman' haha I see so many posts of larger people with the caption ""This is what real women look like"" and they always make me cringe.  Dunno why we care so much what a person weighs!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,VickyHowarth,8,Tue Jul 21 20:50:02 2015 UTC,"Alison styled better than the other liars for the first time this season. I wonder if they hadn't filmed 6x10 yet when all the uproar about Alison's styling started, so they have her a killer prom look."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,prettylittleangry,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:11 2015 UTC,Really? throughout the season I keep on asking why are they dressing her like a 30 year old. No highschool kids dress like that.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,tnafam,4,Tue Jul 21 18:48:53 2015 UTC,OMG IT'S A YELLOW DRESS
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,JaneDarkbloom,4,Tue Jul 21 17:46:30 2015 UTC,It had to be yellow! She looks beautiful.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,prettygirluglysecret,4,Tue Jul 21 17:50:43 2015 UTC,"I don't like the dress. But damn, Alison is stunning. I just hope that she stays away from blunt objects, they have an attraction to the colour yellow in Rosewood."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,tumblety,13,Tue Jul 21 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"I love her so much. Seriously, she is the hottest actress I know. She has the weird chemistry around her, she doesn't look 100% beautiful but if you see her then you are blown away to some another dimension. It sounds so crazy and even perverse maybe haha but seriously I feel it every time I see her scenes. I'm totally blown away.  ""All boys want her, and all girls want to be like her""... and it's so true. No matter how bitchy Alison was, if I lived in Rosewood I would still be secretly in love with her."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,covermaker,10,Tue Jul 21 17:49:15 2015 UTC,Have you seen her audition tape? The intensity is just through the roof.  She really is perfect for Ali.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,tequilaandsunshine,3,Tue Jul 21 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"Realizing how young she was too, it's very impressive"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,KittenQueefs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:17 2015 UTC,Oh I have! Love it! Wasn't she like.. 12?
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,covermaker,2,Tue Jul 21 20:50:30 2015 UTC,I would agree before this season. Now I find her so annoying and weak now on the show. She's a great actress especially for her age and the fact that she started this show around 14 years old or something... she was a better actress than most of the liars and some of them is a decade older than her is pretty dang impressive. The writers are just really good at screwing characters up.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,tnafam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"Idk of course she has changed, but I still love her so much. I could watch this video over and over, the acting is so good and I want to be Lorenzo so bad haha.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPsnrihWyaU"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,covermaker,6,Tue Jul 21 20:48:51 2015 UTC,Did they just recycle her Ice Ball dress like they recycle everything about her this season? The writers are being so mean to Ali. 😢
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,Tiny-Ghost-Grace,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"No, her Ice Ball dress was form-fitting and a darker color."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,scarletregina,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"True, true."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,Tiny-Ghost-Grace,4,Tue Jul 21 17:49:40 2015 UTC,Queen of everything <3
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,scarletregina,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:47 2015 UTC,Thank god they aren't hiding her body. She looks amazing.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,prettylilhanna,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:26 2015 UTC,Thank God! Old posh Alison is back!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,pissypisces,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:00 2015 UTC,YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,sininhu,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:02 2015 UTC,I need put that gif in every picture/video of Ali: https://tvrecappersanonymous.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mamas-proud-enter-cece-drake.gif?w=500&h=281
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,aisallaround,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:23 2015 UTC,She looks beautiful. I'm happy they didn't put her in some long-sleeved grandma dress or business suit and put her in something beautiful and age appropriate
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,litladyloveshp,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:24 2015 UTC,She totally pwns all the other liars prom attire!

PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,ScarletteSilver,0,Tue Jul 21 20:40:21 2015 UTC,She's Fucking gorgeous! Ugh I wish I was her.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ewd,Sh4neB90,0,Tue Jul 21 19:40:41 2015 UTC,I don't know. That butt chin.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,prettylittlenutter,13,Tue Jul 21 16:34:21 2015 UTC,I love how these make me feel like I'm taking a really hard math test lol :)
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,PennysPinkFlannel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:15 2015 UTC,I feel the same way answering the questions. It's like everything about this show makes you question everything you think you know.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,PennysPinkFlannel,3,Tue Jul 21 17:02:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly I'm like ""...um...wait..no...scratches head..um..oh right.."" Lmao BTW, loved that you did this !"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,JaneDarkbloom,2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:10 2015 UTC,Oh no problem! I like seeing everyone's views without getting into disputes about every little thing.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,tumblety,11,Tue Jul 21 17:24:12 2015 UTC,Emily hate game is STRONG
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Savywarren,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:53 2015 UTC,"I chose Emily and I was honestly surprised at seeing how many people did, too. But I guess I should have expected it since she's spent most of this season getting her fling on: Being stalked by a kidnapping, murdering madman? Who cares! I got the ladies to entertain. ;)"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Amyherm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:47 2015 UTC,I chose Mona... She needs to reawaken her inner bitch this season
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,tumblety,4,Tue Jul 21 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"Great list, can't wait to see if I was right after 6x10!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,peytonrae,6,Tue Jul 21 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"After today or tomorrow, I'm going to write out a summary of the answers that ""won"" for each question. Then we can see if the ""majority"" was on track, or we were just completely fooled. Cannot wait for the finale. And thanks for taking it :)"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Nehphi,4,Tue Jul 21 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"Wow. I honestly thought I was completely out of the loop with theories and who dunnit, but I was with the majority on almost all of the questions.   This was a very interesting read, thanks for taking the time to make this!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Alyys,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:02 2015 UTC,No problemo!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,litladyloveshp,3,Tue Jul 21 19:51:11 2015 UTC,Because it's on before Stitchers!!! You made me lol on that last one ;) Great job and thanks!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,litladyloveshp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:13:17 2015 UTC,Has that show been cancelled yet? I always tune in a few minutes before PLL comes on and the acting is horrendous.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Ariassa,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:42 2015 UTC,"It's Harvey Specter not Harvey Spector from suits, and I'm totally shipping Halison now."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Ariassa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:45 2015 UTC,Can you fix the question about minor characters? It only lets you pick one.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Ariassa,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:51 2015 UTC,Fixed!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Ariassa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:48 2015 UTC,Thank ya.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,clutchyball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:52 2015 UTC,Done! But yep it only lets you pick one character
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,lnh92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:38 2015 UTC,"I took it myself, and when I saw that I corrected it. Sorry about that!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,tumblety,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:38 2015 UTC,Oh it's ok. I already took the survey do you want me to take it again to pick more characters?
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,heymeowmeow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:26 2015 UTC,Sure! I think you might be able to just answer that one question and submit it. Let me know if that works!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,handbanaynay,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:45 2015 UTC,It worked :)
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,junjunjenn,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:33 2015 UTC,Woot woot!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,unijack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:17 2015 UTC,Please upvote for sake of getting it on the front page. That way more people are likely to see this survey!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,WolfVamp826,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:19 2015 UTC,Have you thought of posting it on Tumblr and Twitter too?
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,notoriousrdc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:00 2015 UTC,I don't have many followers on twitter. We would send it to the abcfamily pll page? Maybe they will retweet it?
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,notoriousrdc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:41 2015 UTC,Maybe. I think this could interest them. Maybe you should have added gender and age too. But anyways even if it stays in this sub it is a great initiative 😉
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Savywarren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:41 2015 UTC,Was able to incorporate my flair.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,notoriousrdc,2,Tue Jul 21 17:21:03 2015 UTC,Good. Flair is fabulous.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Savywarren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:30 2015 UTC,"I got a little creative on a few of my answers :) Love seeing how everyone on here feels. My favorite answer was to the question about why you watch the show. ""You know, I don't really know."""
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,notoriousrdc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:35 2015 UTC,That was a pretty popular choice as well haha!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,Savywarren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:37 2015 UTC,I think there should be an other box for a lot of the answers as many of the questions don't have an option that accurately conveys my feelings.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,junjunjenn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:53 2015 UTC,I think now is when we put Emily's torch out and kick her off the island. The tribe has spoken.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,notoriousrdc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:36 2015 UTC,If she dropped Sara I don't think we would have this problem.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,camboa,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty disappointed at how many people want Emily to stay single. If all of the straight girls end up paired off and the lesbian stays single, I will fucking cut a bitch. That's just gross, guys, especially considering how often the one gay character ends up alone while all the straight characters get a happily ever after."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e368p,xoamberkinz,3,Tue Jul 21 19:20:10 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the point of why people want her to single. Personally Im not saying cat lady single just, she needs some time and prospective to get a new gurlfriend picker. Hers is faulty."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e3khp,bitchcansee,5,Tue Jul 21 18:50:11 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they were trying to get her for the part where Emily is offered a chance to go back into habitat for humanity but she was too busy with Dancing with the Stars so she was replaced by Nicole in last weeks episode.

Then in the photo of Aria and Clark talking we see a blonde in a red cloak behind them also with a lion mask (?) and the same black hooded figure with horns behind her. Creepy. One last detail I'd like to point out about the man with the drinks is that he has attached ear lobes, and even I laughed typing that. I'm not saying that person is charles, but I am saying that person is played by drew van acker or another male cast member with attached lobes (Julian or tyler). Otherwise, it's a stand in or none of the other males fit."

That dress is not Hanna, it makes Ashley look at least 10 pounds bigger and the shoes are TERRIBLE. Emily's looks like something her mom would wear to a formal event. A blazer?! Why? She's had very beautiful dresses before. Aria's is alright. I'm glad they didn't do another short, fluffy dress but it almost feels to casual. Spencer's is the only one I actually enjoy.   Also, can we talk about how awful the dates are? Haha. The only guy I wanted to see was Caleb, but every love interest is there except him! Even Shower Harvey. Why is Ezra there. Cmon Aria, you can do better than Ezra!   Alison looks beautiful though. I'm glad they put here in something beautiful instead if her typical old lady outfits. She looks amazing."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e3lb0,milkmantoast,4,Tue Jul 21 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"Yes the timeline crap irks me. Shower Harvey supposedly was kidnapped the same weekend Ali went missing. Sept 2009. She was found May 2012. (I figure it is May since grad is in 3 weeks) but everyone keeps saying she has been gone 2 years when it is almost 3. And then when the girls were kidnapped they were in the bunker for a couple days, then escaped and were stuck outside for a couple days. Then after they were let back in it says ""3 weeks later"" in 6.01. So they were gone almost 4 weeks but everyone keeps saying 3 except for the one time Pam was talking to Emily and she asks were they gone 3 weeks and Pam says it was a bit longer than that."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,MCisthebest,6,Tue Jul 21 02:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'd love this. It'd explain things but also still be surprising. I just want Lucas to be relevant in the end, he's an interesting character and it'd be a shame if he was never really brought up again."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,lalahlaleah,2,Tue Jul 21 04:24:59 2015 UTC,The actor said that he is involved in a big way
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,MCisthebest,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:04:32 2015 UTC,Do you have a link for that? I'd love to read anything the actor who plays Lucas said about his character - Lucas is such a shady palm tree.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,cruemelmonster,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:37 2015 UTC,Now that would be shocking!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,ShootMeNowA,2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:51 2015 UTC,I'm feeling conflicted about this...
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,sydface4231,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:48 2015 UTC,This exactly where I'm at right now.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,jj922,20,Tue Jul 21 04:24:29 2015 UTC,I FREAKING LOVE THIS!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,emchasse,15,Tue Jul 21 00:53:48 2015 UTC,"That is an intersting way to look at it.  I dont know though, the yellow dress shows back up in the finale. Imk put the picture on twitter or instagram.  I am pretty sure it was a real memory and that dress will be important."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,dei_gratia64,10,Tue Jul 21 00:07:44 2015 UTC,This.  The two yellow dresses thing stands out in my mind as one of PLL's creepiest scenes. The two little girls in the Halloween episode had a similar chilling effect on me that I just can not shake. I think the showrunners wanted these scenes to leave an impression on us for a reason. The progression of two dresses to the two yellow tops worn on the night of Ali's disappearance has got to be significant.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,emchasse,5,Tue Jul 21 03:09:24 2015 UTC,"Seeing the dress on the mannequin I'm thinking - and this may be a stretch - that maybe the dress could have been given to Charles for his mannequins. He does seem to want to create an 'Ali' doll - maybe he had various dolls growing up to represent her and recreate family that he is missing and mrs d just enabled this. At some point his mannequins turned into an unhinged obsession and grew from dressing up dolls to wearing/getting minions to wear Ali masks and to live Ali dolls.   Mrs D could have continued this into Ali's teenage years - every time she bought Ali a top she might give one to Charles. She may have given him a duplicate yellow top before that night. I seem to remember the top was a gift from her mum and if so, that could fit. We also saw her give clothes from Ali's room to someone the night of the fashion show. I thought this was CeCe because she was on the run but I can't remember if this was assumed or confirmed.   I don't know how the tops could end up on 2 other girls but it can't be a coincidence. There does seem to be a running theme of replicas of Ali, specifically CeCe and Sara Harvey in personality and Bethany - maybe they were living dolls somehow?"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,jj922,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:25:27 2015 UTC,Great points! Dolls are absolutely another running theme we can't deny.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,1ibber5,2,Tue Jul 21 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I liked the op idea, it is very well thought out.  Your are right, it has been a running theme.  I hope by the picture from in 6x10,  it is explained."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,EdibleVampires,5,Tue Jul 21 03:12:02 2015 UTC,Could be a combination of both which would be neat and satisfying!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,JaneDarkbloom,8,Tue Jul 21 02:48:27 2015 UTC,"When Jason was told Charles was imaginary the yellow dress flashback immediately came to my mind.   Whether there were 2 yellow dresses or not, Mrs. D brainwashed her kids that's for sure!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,jj922,5,Tue Jul 21 04:48:47 2015 UTC,So she found her second brother in the piano?

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,Cupcake_eater,2,Tue Jul 21 02:48:03 2015 UTC,What if Alison saw her mom give Charles a yellow dress? And then her mom told her to forget him? That could tie in the real yellow dress and the metaphor.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,wolfrandom,3,Tue Jul 21 03:43:44 2015 UTC,LOVE this.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,Kindofminty,3,Tue Jul 21 01:09:15 2015 UTC,I like the idea but I think it would be too complicated to explain for just that one detail.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,kittensandsunshine,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:55 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I still believe in the yellow dress. Possibly for Bethany or one of the millions of other characters in this story.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0dr7,greenmm25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:29:04 2015 UTC,I love this! I think it's both a beautiful metaphor but also I think she gave the yellow dress to Charles for his mannequin family. Just because an item is tangible doesn't mean it doesn't also represent something intangible.

It would fit a lot better if it's a woman helped by a male minion (especially if he's someone that we know, like Wren, Toby, Lucas or Ezra)."

Obviously as far as boobs are concerned they would have to be pretty small though, if that is even the real A playing A.

Just like 12 episodes before Mona reveal in the greenhouse it was like a definite guy. Then, as we got closer to the end of season 2, A started looking more and more feminine and tiny like Mona. The same thing is happening now as well.  By the way - Red Coat, Black Widow and Mona's Killer were 100% women anyway, just look at her bootie:  http://kissthemgoodbye.net/pll/albums/SEASON%205/12/Pretty_Little_Liars_S05E12_Taking_This_One_to_the_Grave_1080p_KISSTHEMGOODBYE_NET_2492.jpg  They are doomed if they'll say how it was Wren with a wig haha"

Why even bother bringing in people like Clark, Aussie girl, Sara and Lorenzo when you have freaking Sasha Pieterse and Janel Parrish ready and able to slay any scene they are in.. yet are barely being used?  To be honest, my theory is that the writers are stubborn and dumb. To have Alison and even Jason missing from episodes entirely centered around finding THEIR brother is totally absurd!"

PrettyLittleLiars,3e3aln,faedreams,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"Well, judging by the new pictures from 6x09, it is pretty clear that they're actually going to prom. However, a few stills show the girls at what seems to be Spencer's barn (I'm assuming this because the set where Ezra is taking photos doesn't look like any of the girls' houses). So, I'm guessing that maybe they do attend to prom, but they get banned during it? I don't know, it is all so confusing."

We've only watched about five episodes of the first season and there seem to be a lot of references to Aria's eyes.  The comment from Mike, and two comments Aria makes, which I believe they are in two different scenes and possibly two different episodes.    I can't remember what the context of the conversation is, but she's slightly agitated/annoyed and the two comments are very similar, something along the lines of ""I have eyes!"" and ""I can see, I have eyes!"".  I noticed this BEFORE the episode with the doll and the needle in the eye came out, so I wasn't actively looking or listening for clues about her eyes, they were just there and I thought it was kind of weird."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0atp,Potterlove,8,Tue Jul 21 02:43:48 2015 UTC,Good point! Her commitment to Ezra is pretty much a sort of promise

IDK if you'd consider it breaking a promise since they found out. I think she also repromised a few times when they got back together and idk when he found out the girls knew, but I think he was pissed.  The only other promise I can think of off the top of my head is when her Mom made her promise not to tell that Mike hurt/sprained her arm when he went through his breakdown in season two. And I'm pretty sure she kept that promise.  (edited to make sense)"

PrettyLittleLiars,3e29rg,shadyswamp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:55 2015 UTC,I agree. They had to give clues to all their red herrings first cause they knew it would go on for a couple more seasons.

I think it's frustrating right now because we don't have all the pieces, but am hopeful that once Charles, Black Widow and Red Coat are revealed, things will fall into place.  I think part of the frustration is that A has been female in most people's eyes since season 3. Mona says, she stole the game from me. There are so many clues that a woman is in charge. And I think a woman is in charge. I just think there are different A games going on. They sometimes work together; they sometimes work against each other. We have two big female A personas to reveal this season, too. Everyone is just so hung up on Charles, that they are forgetting that Red Coat and Black Widow has been behind most of the bad stuff that has happened to the girls."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e29rg,kkh03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:58 2015 UTC,I feel like other people were supposed to be A. Maybe Ezra or Toby. But then the show got picked up for more seasons so they had to change it to red herrings to keep the show going.

For example if (if!) Wren will be Charles then we could go back and see him act shady and probably connect his scenes to A endings for example.  But you are right, before we saw the anagrams with Charles' name and the blocks there was no way we could have guessed that hey, there is a third secret DiLaurentis child and his name is Charles. We couldn't have guessed that whoever is Charles is Charles because we had no idea Chuck existed.  Basically - Before the end of 5B: Who is A? - After 5B: Who the chuck is Charles?"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e2zaj,bitchcansee,4,Tue Jul 21 15:45:04 2015 UTC,"I like this, someone else pointed out that he probably got blamed on a ton of things that he actually didn't do. Someone else also mentioned that Jason could have taken on Charles's persona which was a really good theory. I think we are all getting on the same track and I think it would be awesome before the reveal we all end up figuring it out and what his motive might be. I think Jason did a lot of the abuse to Ali. I wrote this out to someone on youtube that Jason had a lot of anger issues with Ali. Remember when she said ""pigskin"" was the one that hit her when they were getting dressed in Spencer's room? And Jason acted like he was going to hit her with the hockey stick? When she was 3 and broke her arm Charles's would have been in Radley by then. Maybe Jason was the one to try and drown Ali and Charles heard Ali screaming and wanted to help her but before he could Mr. D saw him and blamed him and Jason was to scared to admit he did it or that was his plan was to get him sent away."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e2zaj,ToffeeTango101,3,Tue Jul 21 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, and Jason is at the top of my list. It also makes sense because Keegan Allen said in an interview we can pick up hints from the beginning. I'm not so down for a multiple personality disorder thing, as I think it's too cliche and stigmatizing. It'd be a great homage to the books if they had switched places. And if that's the case, it would make sense that he has a female accomplice (not to give too many book spoilers)."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e2zaj,Mockingbird_Boo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:34 2015 UTC,I agree.  I think he was wrongly accused and sent to Radley because Ali kept being abused after that.  Maybe Charles is A in that he is going after people that hurt Ali (as you mentioned the NAT Club) or that he is trying to find her and protect her and in doing that is doing A things to the Liars.    I think you're on to something and would like to see what others think.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e2zaj,Distortedclarity,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"I like this and am keeping in mind that Charles may actually be a somewhat innocent character or separate entity to the real villain. Like I have said in a past post I think the real villain is someone who knows everything about what happened with Charles and is messing with everyone and everything. The person that fits that for me is CeCe because it's been shown she has inserted herself into the DiLaurentis' family drama right from the start and we know she loves masks, dolls, different identities and games too. She has messed with things in Radley, likely impersonating Ali and sending Bethany letters as Ali. Dressing as Ali in Radley. Wearing yellow top on ""the night""  It is really quite possible that Charles is alive and at the end of the day is a badly wronged kid that has a different view on the world to others and has made some questionable decisions because of it. If a lie is what put him in Radley then it kind of makes sense that he may be fascinated with the liars and Ali because their lives revolve around untruths and games and I could absolutely see that he has played games and manipulated situations to lead them onto the path to uncovering the truth about his identity and story."

It was so random. She was sure that me and him were secretly hooking up and I haven't actually seen him in years but I guess he still had my cell number. The girl kept calling me from a blocked number and I finally realized who it was because I heard HIS voice in the background. Took me forever to figure it out. After I did figure it out though, I found his number through a bunch of old friends and called him and said that if his girlfriend didn't stop, I'd go to the police. He got scared and admitted that it WAS her calling me and told me she's insane. I hung up and never got a call again.   Maybe a crazy ex or their new SO are contacting you? Or some crazy old friend?

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,cheshyrecatt,43,Mon Jul 20 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"While I admit that social media isnt really helping the staff, I think the problem is not their use of social media but their writing. Its just bad writing. For example the barrel. It was so much focused for like 2 or 3 episodes, and then we never heard of it again. We dont know if the final status of the stuff in there is ""not possible to identify"" or if indeed someone is in there. Their writing should be clearer. I understand they have to keep the main secret but revealing for instance whats in the fucking barrel won't need them to reveal who is A."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,Eddy1504,13,Mon Jul 20 21:47:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think the writers need to understand that the majority of their audience are NOT the ""out of sight, out of mind"" type people. The proper phrase for us is, ""Gone but NOT forgotten."" They can't just wave something right in front of our faces for a couple weeks, then just drop it cold, and really believe that we will just forget about it. Do they not notice or do they not care?"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,JulieAdd121,9,Tue Jul 21 00:58:14 2015 UTC,"I think they just underestimate their fans. The casual viewer most likely won't remember.

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,sdhuff,24,Tue Jul 21 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They shouldn't be using social media to answer questions, the story should be clear enough to answer itself."

That shows too much of sloppy writing. They should stick to the books, it would still be a great story to watch."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,mjigs,7,Mon Jul 20 22:35:14 2015 UTC,I kind of wish they didn't tell us they haven't chosen A. It makes me feel like all the clues in the earlier seasons don't apply.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,in_omniaparatus,9,Mon Jul 20 23:10:15 2015 UTC,"That too, they should have an A in the first place so all the clues match to all the information they gave us, and another plot apart just in case the series was canceled.

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,birdsofterrordise,10,Tue Jul 21 08:33:25 2015 UTC,deff right. i'm getting annoyed as hell with the overuse of the writers reliance on social media to explain themselves. I don't even use snapchat and Marlene has been snap chatting clues. This goes along with the incorporation of Ravenswood mixed in with PLL. I HATED when they did that because it was like they were forcing us to watch that dumb spin off show just to understand main factors in PLL and it was just unfair. A normal show shouldn't have to use all of these extra side things to explain themselves so its horrible writing.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,jamesthegill,9,Mon Jul 20 23:00:37 2015 UTC,Also consider future watching -- people won't go back to old social media feeds in order to understand the show.

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,mjigs,39,Mon Jul 20 21:47:34 2015 UTC,I had such high hopes for season 6. I figured that 10 episodes would be just enough time to fully explain everything and also allow for a little filler (of course). But there are only 4 episodes left and there is still so much left to answer! I am so sick of pointless episodes filled with Sara Harvey and Lesli!
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,TheyCallMeMelly,17,Mon Jul 20 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"I am over these filler characters/scenes like Shower Harvey and Egg man. I also wish they used an old character (maybe Noel?) to take the place of Lesli. I don't know if it's just me, but I am not a fan of a new character being so important to the story line."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,mjigs,9,Mon Jul 20 23:13:15 2015 UTC,Specially when they are two insignificant characters imo
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,Parvichard,10,Mon Jul 20 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"It's a double edged sword. On one side, I hope that Sara is more significant than they are making her out to be, simply because I refuse to believe that the writing would be this bad just before the big reveal... But on the other... If she is more significant then that means we will be seeing even more of her later on and that thought makes me want to drive a knife through my eyeball - Aria tennis ball style."

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,keebiejeebie,11,Tue Jul 21 00:38:17 2015 UTC,I wonder if 6x10 is going to be this brilliant-written episode that every minute is just one answer after another. :P
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,Gekko1983,4,Mon Jul 20 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get my hopes up, whenever they say that THAT(not saying 6x10) episode is going to be big, i get disappointed because it never THAT big of deal as they were parodying."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,Blopez31,2,Mon Jul 20 22:39:43 2015 UTC,I think the problem with 6x10 will be that they're trying to cram so many answers into 42 minutes that there will be no time to react to things - it's just going to be straight exposition like 4x24 was.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,sadaboutKTextinction,4,Tue Jul 21 15:01:14 2015 UTC,Nope.  Just a half-hearted A reveal that answers 10-15% of questions and creates 50% more plot holes.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,thenewmeredith,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:20 2015 UTC,"I have a smidgen of hope that it will be brilliant. They said the characters cried when they filmed the ending episodes of season 6A. Also, that we will feel empathy for Charles. I hope so! I hope it moves me to tears! That would be great writing! Hope it doesn't bring me tears of frustration, anger, and disappointment. I hope I don't feel that I have wasted my time on this show. So far, unfortunately, that is how I am feeling with all these filler episodes."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,Dani_Stormborn,8,Tue Jul 21 01:03:17 2015 UTC,"Terrible writing. As I said in another post, I feel like they make up shit as they go. They had NO clue what was going to happen from the very start, so if they've hinted at alleged clues all throughout the seasons they're delusional. They are just trying to find a way for us to forget previous major ""clues"" and storylines so we can be ""oh wow, they're so cunning, they totally had this planned all along""."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,thenewmeredith,6,Mon Jul 20 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"Lol I think they weren't sure how long they were gonna have to keep this up. They already admitted Charles was something they came up with after Mona when season 3 started. If that's true, then he was never the original intent for A and the show should have ended 4 fucking seasons ago.   IMO this series would have been wayyyy better as a British show where the seasons are incredibly short. If the writers had a clear direction of what ABCFamily wanted to do, they could have planned ahead instead of 5 extra seasons of dragging out a plot that, frankly, I believe they had no idea what to do with for at least the last 2 seasons.   With season 7 set as the supposed end, that's when the writers saw a plan in mind. Between getting the go ahead last year for the next two and all the way back at Mona, they probably were unsure of how long this was gonna go on and only it made it worse for themselves by adding random storylines (fucking Ezra being A, Toby being A, iirc Caleb might have been suspected for awhile, not to mention Ravenswood, that dude Emily shot, whatsherface that died from a 4 ft fall in New York) and complicated basically every possibility of any character being A.   This season has been a great quality jump for me but I suspect that writers only now know what the future of the series is but even though they have that figured out, the answers are going to be shitty and confusing because of the past information we have been given. It's going to be very difficult for them to create an answer for every little thing (the beach hottie? how A pays for this? Sooo many things.....) and so there probably won't be.   TL;DR: For a very long time in the middle, the writers had no idea what they were doing or how long the show would continue and they are only just now able to see an end but the previous seasons will complicate that end and likely cause a sweep under the rug of every question."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,Rosewoodsfinest,6,Tue Jul 21 00:55:58 2015 UTC,"Like I said in my other reply, I think you hit the nail on the head. I would just add that this show became too big for its own good and ABC Family wanted to milk it to death. We don't need 7 seasons to find out the identity of one person. And if they didn't decide A until season 3, doesn't that make the first two seasons kinda pointless?   The writing is shitty and I hate myself for coming back, hoping to find A so I can say ""good, riddance"" once and for all"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,supermelon928,5,Tue Jul 21 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"I wish I had the capacity to quit shows. I hate this show. I really do. I wish I'd stopped after Mona and said ""ok Mona's A then."" I just wanna know who A is. That's all I want and I know the answer will be crap and make no sense but I have to know what the canon answer is and how it happens."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzglv,Dani_Stormborn,5,Tue Jul 21 01:10:52 2015 UTC,You are not the only one I wish the writers wrote a list of every question that needs to be answered so far none of the questions have been answered. Episode 7 is tomorrow and we don't have any answers.   Edit: spelling

As a passionate viewer since day 1 I'm frustrated and disappointed by what seems like lack of planning. I'm certain that the writers have to answer to the network and so on... however, you would think they would have had a plan set in mind from the beginning like... if we end in 2 seasons it ends here.. and if we are renewed for more seasons we do this.

They read only what people say on Twitter - who are, in general, young girls talking about ships and easily gullible. So the producers are creating a story based on that type of audience, especially to this age group. What matters to IMK is stretch the story for 8 seasons to generate profit to them. Who's A is not important, since it already keep the audience until there with all that bullshit nonsense mystery. If people don't like the finale... ""screw them, we're rich right now and we don't need them anymore""! That's clear to see, they do this to us for, like, 4 or 6 finales."

From then on I resigned to the fact there isn't going to be clean cut ending with all the loose ends tied up neatly in a ribbon. But I just keep watching since I'm in too deep now.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,josephdean21,5,Mon Jul 20 23:52:27 2015 UTC,Wouldn't more people watch then too if they realized they'd find something new out each episode?
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,Edugan1,20,Tue Jul 21 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, I haven't been shocked since Ezra's reveal but they ruined that with a book storyline. Mona's reveal was the best!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,KanKan28,11,Tue Jul 21 00:47:13 2015 UTC,That reveal was so good! And when he went back to his base and threw a hissy fit knowing someone had been there! The book just didn't answer for all the massive pictures he had of Alison. I really hope the reveal is as good as that was.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,tumblety,6,Tue Jul 21 02:07:52 2015 UTC,That was probably the most shocking one and it turned out to be nothing.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,PrettyLittleLawyerz,8,Tue Jul 21 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"I would LOVE it if Ezra turned out to be A, and he was like ""you actually believed that ridiculous 'true crime novel' excuse?!  OF COURSE I'm A!"""
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,sdhuff,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:02 2015 UTC,Yeah it was one of those reveals that shocked me and then I started thinking about it and was like this makes so much sense! But then I realized they didn't hype up the fact they were telling us who A was so I assumed it wasn't a real reveal.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,Dani_Stormborn,14,Tue Jul 21 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"That was what I was saying. This show used to be immersive, mysterious, and FUN. Now the writers have us obsessing over A -- look I get it, thats the whole premise -- it has gotten to the point (due to the way they've handled things in my opinion) that that is what everyone cares about. This show had A LOT of potential  Sasha, the girl who plays Ali, is an example of a neglected potential. She is an absolute star and overtime she gets on camera she grabs your attention -- they call it scene stealer I believe.. Anyway, maybe I'm childish to think they dont want her stealing the limelight from the other girls so they keep her in the background but that's what it looks like to me. The Alison in the flashback would NEVER stay indoors because her dad said so or because people gossiped about her."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,PinkFurryLamp,2,Tue Jul 21 05:38:23 2015 UTC,Yep. It's a completely different show.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,carpe-jvgvlvm,13,Tue Jul 21 06:03:53 2015 UTC,"Preach! It's like they wrote out a really awesome 3 season show and then decided to stretch it out to 7 seasons. Like they have the mid and season finales planned but it doesn't really matter what happens in between. I feel like they sit around saying ""Well we know we're gonna reveal Charles on episode 10, what can we do for the other 9 episodes? Oh we can give Emily yet another love interest that makes no sense! We can make them suspect that someone they just met today has been torturing them for years! Let's bring back Spencer's drug counselor from who knows how long ago to fill a couple episodes!"" It's driving me insane! Yet I still come back to it every week haha. Even if they drag it out 5 more years, I'll still be here loving and hating at the same time."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,zebracakes0_o,7,Tue Jul 21 00:42:08 2015 UTC,"I still have some (very VERY minor) hope that the randomness and lack of logic in 5B and 6A, which honestly has been dreadful to watch at times, will turn out to mean something bigger. No, I can't imagine what that ""something"" could be, lol, but I try to imagine scenarios... :("
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,carpe-jvgvlvm,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:09 2015 UTC,You put everything I've felt into words. Literally!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,tifftuffs,9,Tue Jul 21 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"I wonder if a lot of this ""get hype! —for nothing..."" isn't the network more than the writers?  I've even wondered if the social BS is part of their contracts now, like ABCFam maybe saw some of the social in earlier seasons, and decided that tweeting clues or weird pics would be a required part of being on the show? So IMK + writers + actors possibly have to post that crap to satisfy the network, or maybe the network posts it in their names.  S1-S3 episodes, regular and finales, were far more satisfying overall. I wonder if S4+ wouldn't seem ""better"" if we could block out all the hype? I doubt it, because I can usually remember S1-S3 episodes (eg, ""the one where Emily and Hanna broke into Noel's cabin!""), whereas S5 and S6 so far just really blend together into a sort of giant ...blob.  Really, try to think of a random S5/S6 episode and remember what happened, like, 5x06. I have zero clue. I know Mona fake-died in 5x14 (?), and there was a Christmas special, and the 5B premiere had Grunwald in it. That's it. I know stuff happened, but I don't remember the order and episodes anymore without looking it up."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,NoodlyPuddles,6,Tue Jul 21 03:28:09 2015 UTC,"IA. The first episode this season was great and it's gone downhill from there and it really shows in the ratings.  I just really hope since the synopsis made it seem like Charles is going to go crazy on Rosewood for his birthday the next episode is epic. If not, I'm really going to lose my faith in this show and consider cutting ties after 6x10."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,Ronlovesu17,5,Tue Jul 21 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"Yes!! I remember binge watching the first couple of seasons during the middle of the day and actually being so scared, double checking the doors were locked and everything- and I was like 22 at the time. Now it's just like 'meh, who cares' nothing ever happens. You never know when a 'big reveal' is just another red herring."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,tumblety,5,Tue Jul 21 03:57:00 2015 UTC,I feel the same way too.!! After the finale I'm done with this fuckfest of a show. 😤😤
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,strawberryswing1,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:06 2015 UTC,I probably won't watch it anymore if I'm not satisfied with this finale.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,Mdutch39,14,Tue Jul 21 01:06:23 2015 UTC,Oh you'll watch it. We all will. We're like Spencer with those brownies.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,milkmantoast,3,Tue Jul 21 02:09:05 2015 UTC,"I remember having to have my brother walk me to my car when I left because I was so scared after watching an episode! Now I'm like, blah, that's unrealistic.    YES!!! I remember watching the episode where Ian chases Spencer in the church with my friend one night and we were on the edge of our seats! Now it's like, seriously, you don't even try to fight back when you get attacked for the hundredth time? :p"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,Amyherm,2,Tue Jul 21 13:48:27 2015 UTC,But burritos are so delicious
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,sininhu,2,Tue Jul 21 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"i totally get you, but this season has been my favorite yet. the hype is unreal. sure, the only important episodes are the first and last, but we're finally gonna get a fucking answer. it's so close i can almost taste it."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,mildlyadorable,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I loved how they did everything with the other reveals and really used a build up to get us scared for the finale. The Mona reveal was the best episode of PLL and I also really liked Ezra's reveal with the lair in Ravenswood and the fact that they had us guessing if Ali was still alive or not. We had multiple mysteries back in the day (Is Ali still alive? If she's alive, who's in the grave? What happened to the NAT club? What happened to Maya?) and now it's all about A and filler ships."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,ajade14,2,Tue Jul 21 11:20:10 2015 UTC,I think if we just watch the first episode and the finale of the seasons we'll know exactly the same relevant things that people who watch the entire season. We always have 8 or 10 episodes full of nonsense fillers.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0am6,Parvichard,2,Tue Jul 21 15:57:52 2015 UTC,Oh my god yes why didn't I think of this I could have saved 8 hours of my life. Just kidding like I had anything better to do.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3es7,VermouthPLL,7,Tue Jul 21 17:31:52 2015 UTC,"Ewwwww at Shower Harvey and Emily on the background. We knew it, but they still look awful together and they're much worse than I could think."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e2m0h,GamerWife10,3,Tue Jul 21 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of MTV, the shows are just soooooo cheesy. I couldn't get through the first episode of Teen Wolf on Netflix. But if you say it's good and you're going to watch my show, I'll give yours a chance ;) besides I loved the movies. Scream was my first horror movie and I've been hooked on the genre since."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e2m0h,GamerWife10,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:54 2015 UTC,I'm totally the same way with MTV and I wasn't even going to try. But as being in love with the movies i had to. It's nothing great but definitely a guilty pleasure. My husband usually hates all things that's not the walking dead and game of thrones actually likes it and watches week to week!

But I think it's creepy because of the psychological stance of how easily manipulated children are and there's nothing the parents can do about it.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,cruemelmonster,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:01 2015 UTC,thank you
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,Dani_Stormborn,5,Tue Jul 21 18:23:36 2015 UTC,All these LucAs theories are making me feel quite conflicted...
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,notoriousrdc,4,Tue Jul 21 08:52:35 2015 UTC,"As others have already said, Lucas being A would be very hard to pull off given his age. He is the EXACT same age as the girls (or close to it), unless someone wants to introduce the possibility that Lucas is older than he says (hell, or looks)  Anyway, we've already suspected Lucas at one point (so did the girls), so if writers double back and say, ""Gotcha! It's really him!"" I'll be disappointed"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,darxx,2,Tue Jul 21 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's possible at this point to have A be someone they haven't already made a serious suspect at some point, though. That would pretty much leave us with Pastor Ted and Tippi as our A options."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,katiealaska,0,Tue Jul 21 16:53:00 2015 UTC,They thought Wren was A.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,darxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"Actually I keep hearing this and it wouldn't matter his age if Charles died and he's just impersonating him. The actor will be making an appearance in the 6A finale. It's been confirmed he will be ""involved"" in the episodes of the finale or close to the finale. Wren will not be. And those that theorize Cece is Charles assume Cece is transgendered and was once a man. The actor who plays Lucas himself stated that would be a great reveal, but he thinks the network would not approve something like that. So if it's not Cece, the other only real suspect to be A, it has to be Lucas."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,peytonrae,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"Tbh I think Lucas has just been blackmailed a lot into doing things, there's no way he could be Charles. Besides the age thing, he had a life going on while Charles was definitely in Radley. He's been with the girls in school this whole time."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,darxx,2,Tue Jul 21 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"wasnt he homeschooled after he got tired of Mona blackmailing him. He even mentioned, he has a lot of free time. He could have easily just impersonated Charles in order to hide his true identity. Besides, we haven't seen Wren or Jason in a black hoodie. But we have Lucas and Cece. And i think lucas is a transgendered person so i definitely think it's him."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e157v,darxx,3,Tue Jul 21 05:06:38 2015 UTC,I highly doubt Lucas is transgendered. I think they were paying homage to the books.One of the writers (in god knows what article) said they weren't going to go with that sort of storyline.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,dymphnawolf,10,Mon Jul 20 23:17:00 2015 UTC,Yes they did. But he still turned up at the high school for  classes. Though maybe it was for show. Rosewood HS is probably run as well as the police department. Maybe he just walked in and sat down.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,astrokey,5,Mon Jul 20 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"You see, the problem is...was this intentional on the part of the writers or just a bloop? These are the kinds of details we just don't know about. (Also see: Aria ordering a cheeseburger in the pilot.)"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,dymphnawolf,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"I would love for it to be intentional but just to fuck with us or that it Aria was genuinely forgotten until it was too late  to fix it.   The thing with the pilot I can let go because from what I understand, pilots are written before a lot of the series is figured out and before casting (Ezra was blond in the original script and Byron is a sexy dude). But by season 5, they would have all the kinks figured out. And I heard somewhere that the burger was for Mike"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,trafficlightparty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:34 2015 UTC,I thought he had to go back and repeat his senior year because he'd missed it while in juvenile detention or something?

PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,MensRightsActivia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:00 2015 UTC,I always thought he was supposed to be one or two years older.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,covermaker,5,Tue Jul 21 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"It would explain why he looked so old and out of place in the flashback where he was supposed to be like 12.  He actually is blond + has blue eyes + cleft chin = which make him a huge contender for DiLaurentis family member.  edit: By the way - what if he met Marion at Radley and after she was released Marion adopted him and named him Toby, lied about age etc. What if the REAL Toby died at an early age or something? And the father didn't live with them so he had no idea that it was actually Charles."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,altkraz,4,Mon Jul 20 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"But Toby was younger than Charles, because he was in jail for minors not in the actual jail."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,monaforever,3,Mon Jul 20 23:17:10 2015 UTC,He became a cop after he graduate. He was a year ahead of the girls. That's why he was a carpenter and not in school at all after season 2.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,tifftuffs,2,Tue Jul 21 00:35:32 2015 UTC,Toby wasn't in high school when he became a cop. Somewhere along in season 2 he got his GED.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e03ps,justessforall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:48 2015 UTC,I think Jessica and Marion are sisters.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e2ils,MakeMyA,6,Tue Jul 21 13:32:58 2015 UTC,"I believe the Mona/Shana quote is the other way around. Mona was buying Jenna's car and Shana was facilitating the sale. Mona asks if ""she's in"" and Shana says, ""She doesn't have a choice [because she's rapidly losing her eyesight and can't drive anymore.]"""
PrettyLittleLiars,3e2ils,heymeowmeow,2,Tue Jul 21 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, this sounds the most logical based on what happened. As much as I'd love a Mona/Melissa connection, I'd say this was definitely about the car."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e2ils,andria_eanel,2,Tue Jul 21 15:27:50 2015 UTC,"Well Mona and Melissa have probably worked together for awhile, though who knows if it was mutual or forced at this point. She made her be Black Swan in season two, so that's probably when it started. Who knows if Mona ever tipped her off about Ian's engagement ring or gave it back to her. Melissa did make it seem like A made her, but idk if I'd believe it tbh."

PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,CuriousSahm,24,Mon Jul 20 16:55:17 2015 UTC,great way of tying the older and younger kids together. Completely forgot about that aspect amid all of the Marion/DiLaurentis/Montgomery theories.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,soph876,23,Mon Jul 20 19:07:50 2015 UTC,I love this idea. It's ridiculous that we still don't know why A killed any of these people.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,milkmantoast,10,Mon Jul 20 17:04:04 2015 UTC,I like this idea!   Maybe Mona somehow found out about what Charles was doing decided to copy him? Or vice versa? It seems a bit too convenient that there would be two separate A games
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,dymphnawolf,7,Mon Jul 20 22:56:38 2015 UTC,How has no one thought of this before! It's seems so obvious now!
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,bloves123,6,Mon Jul 20 20:08:10 2015 UTC,"Throwing something else out there:  The NAT club was known for ""seeing all"", right? Taping people, etc? What if the NAT club had video evidence that Charles was alive and well after his supposed death? Or to take it a step further, incriminating evidence of him doing something shady? That's when Charles had issue with them, and began killing them off. Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,hashtagshowoff,2,Tue Jul 21 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"I love that theory! I think anything that links back to seasons 1 and 2 would be amazing, since those first seasons were so well done!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,Tiny-Ghost-Grace,9,Tue Jul 21 04:07:58 2015 UTC,"This is very feasible, since we only see the story via the Liars' point of view, and because Melissa and the older kids seem dead scared of A."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,NoodlyPuddles,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:38 2015 UTC,Since they had hidden cameras around maybe they caught something Charles did on tape and it was something he didn't want to get out so he went after each of them...
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,Mockingbird_Boo,5,Tue Jul 21 03:42:23 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if the NAT file names had any significance?  Most of them were probably initials of names but a few were full names maybe meaning they were more important [Ali, Melissa,Garrett; Toby &Jenna were also full names but I think that's because what they recorded (their sexual relationship) was crazy].  I also think Charles may have been paying them for the videos, as Jason suggested there was a benefactor supporting the NAT club.  Thoughts?"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,Dlm1982,3,Mon Jul 20 17:25:13 2015 UTC,Interesting. Maybe Charles used them to tape Ali and her friends from an early age.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,stuckinabarrell211,5,Mon Jul 20 17:37:13 2015 UTC,I like this! Like he just wanted to be in their lives and see what they were doing and it kind of got out of hand.  He had to kill the members because they could have given out information that could have really gotten the police and the girls on the right track
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,Lyco_499,4,Mon Jul 20 17:49:32 2015 UTC,I agree.. I've been saying this. I don't believe Charles escaped that same night as Bethany that's gonna be the big reveal for next week. Just like they wanted us to believe he was dead and then in the following episode Mona revealed he wasn't. The time line don't add up with his age if he is older than Jason.. didn't they say he died at 16?
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,aisravenswood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"Them making him out to be dead was such an episode filling, junk move. The episode titles and synopsis' were released already for one thing, ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" and ""Game Over, Charles"" etc makes it a little obvious. And I know the Liars are desperate, but their ""ok, this person is definitely A...no wait, this person is definitely A..no, wait..."" thing every time someone is even slightly sketchy, is just so crazy making at this point lol."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,papillion91,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:52 2015 UTC,this makes so much sense I love it.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,SimonKillface,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:25 2015 UTC,Interesting theory! But why targeting the four girls?
PrettyLittleLiars,3dyqig,whimrocker,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:47 2015 UTC,He may blame them for Bethany's death or he's forced to find new dolls after the older group goes away

My ideal scenario would be that during his research for his book that he was originally writing about his family, he found out about his real family the DiLaurentis', he became obsessed with what happened to Alison and what they did to him when he was a young lad and is taking revenge. That lair was way OTT for research otherwise.  Ezra has been sketchy even in season 5. There were parts of his book that were hidden, he spoke to that Neilson guy and we have no idea what was said because they made a point of not showing it after he threatened him. The Varjak stuff and pretending to not know what it meant when Emily asked him. The fact he is always hanging around the girls. His age fits Charles I think? The train set he had was used in Charles' dollhouse. ""Your favorite"" letter to board shorts which is Ezra and ""Your favorite"" letter to MonaAli. The gas mask.   There's quite a few clues that would make sense if he was Charles to be honest."

Right now my expectations for it are very low based on how the show is going within the last few seasons and based on seeing other shows do a big time-jump.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e07ac,PoolGirlWithGloves,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:19 2015 UTC,"I watch PLL for the girls not for the A mystery so I wouldn't be for a season dedicated to A.  The reason I was interested in the show to begin with was Ezra and Aria.  I had read comments on You Tube complaining that Life Unexpected had stolen the storyline line from PLL.  I thought that was funny because I can name many shows with teacher/student storylines.  If the A season had more Ezria I would watch for sure but in general I don't think it is a good idea.  Some times I wish the show had been canceled at the end of season 3 because then at least Aria had broken up with Ezra because it was the best thing for him and his son and sometimes loving someone means letting them go.  I think the writers would have a hard time writing an A season anyhow since they have written themselves into a circles of nonsense, I'm not sure they could untangle their mess now.  If they did it they would have to explain everything about Mona, the A-Team, Charles, and uber-A or the fans would be again disappointed."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,tinyyetfierce7,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:37 2015 UTC,I don't even remember who that is... what season? I'm doing a rewatch right now :)
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,MonasLawyer,3,Tue Jul 21 02:15:24 2015 UTC,He was in 'UnmAsked' in season 2. And 'She's better now' in season 3. He was the Inn keeper of the lost woods resort and he also later showed up at school as the janitor. He is the one who cleaned out Mona's lair and he writes Mona a letter or something that's in his journal about how much he cares for her and he's basically obsessed with her. He also has a sweet tooth just like A. There's a whole theory video on YouTube you can watch :)
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,tifftuffs,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"Oo okay, I'll look it up. Thanks!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,tifftuffs,3,Tue Jul 21 04:27:03 2015 UTC,Your theory is too real and I like it way too much. I don't usually like the idea of it all being in someone's head but I could DEFINITELY get in line with this one.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,tifftuffs,2,Tue Jul 21 02:06:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's heavily inspired by Buffy. It's the only thing I could come up with where everything is explainable!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,tifftuffs,4,Tue Jul 21 02:14:37 2015 UTC,"I used to have this theory that everyone was A. That everybody (parents, significant others, friends, the liars) donned the black hoodie (or a red coat, or a black veil) because they were trying to teach one another a lesson or to take out there rage and hate and  get revenge since they lived in such a Pleasantville type place where they had to keep appearances up so being A was a way to let out frustrations. In this theory I thought the parents were being A to try and scare the girls straight and someone took the game from them and started getting violent. But everyone kept being A, and in the end no one would know who the real person who started it was and it'd be one of those things where the town got deeply unhinged from this and it became a very shady town white picket fence town where the -A thing became a tradition that was passed down and it would end with you seeing a new group of liars being harassed by A.  When they started tying in supernatural things I altered my theory. So the -A game got passed down through the generations, and nobody knows who started it. There was a head figure -A no one knew of and they sometimes recruited you, sometimes you were blackmailed, but you had to don the hoodie and do what they told you or you or your family got really screwed (explains why Em got it a lot because she would have constantly refused to do it). Well pretty much my theory went that the town went from Pleasantville to Children of the Corn, and maybe the liars were a destined group of girls chosen every so often to break the -A curse. They could either learn from the lies and fight against A, or continue to screw up and eventually it would be Game Over liars. I theorized that the main A and a lot of people screwing with them were just the spirits of those who died from the A games. The head -A that was a ghost of some deeply messed up ancestor that was possessing one of the liars.  So tl;dr. My theory was so dumb and out there, especially the supernatural half."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,tifftuffs,4,Tue Jul 21 02:57:28 2015 UTC,Uhh I love it. Maybe in the final episode Sam & Dean can show up and set things straight ;)
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,plltwin,3,Tue Jul 21 03:05:22 2015 UTC,Hahaha I could see Trickster being -A. Watch Ezra is really his disguise so he could get near hot high school girls.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0nkk,tifftuffs,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"Pfft Yup Adam would chip in that he only kind of ended the world and sold his brothers out but only because he was tricked by a third rate angel that looked like a shady cars salesman. Then they'd probably start bickering eventually about which family and who's life was worse. Adam would totally go in about how at least Charles has never been to hell and Charles would only say Try visiting Rosewood, just go there and see"

Caleb seems impossible because of Ravenswood, but, he has the Jenna connection (albeit explained), and Ezra/Mona surveillance skillz. MOSTLY though, if all this crap about ""Charles"" is true (which I can't believe):   Caleb's the one with a missing father who eventually came-and-left (could've been an actor; A is rich! That storyline was weird.) Caleb's mom had two other kids (how convenient) and was super rich, explaining possibly how A got money in a disturbing fashion. Most RANDOM introduced-regular (or reoccuring) that I can think of. Lyndon James seemed random at first, but then tied in well; I don't even TRY to explain S5/S6; even Cece has good backstory, pictures, etc. Why is Caleb in Rosewood?   But this is ""impossible"". (Of course, so is my theory about Mona being in Radley this whole time...) Because why spin off Ravenswood to give A a supernatural past life on another series? Except   Caleb did leave for Ravenswood, where a huge part of the creep factor (The Great Charlemagne, Ezra's lair, Grunwald) entered into the story.   Yeah, that's my know it's wrong but keeping an eye out for it theory. :) Or maybe he could prove to be whatever Uber-A is?"

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzpzb,1ims,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"Is that tuition, or is that the estimated cost including books, room, board, etc?  That's insane.  What state is it?  I went to a well respected  private university in Mississippi from 2003-2007.   Small classes, great professors, nice campus. At the time tuition was $11k a year.  (Because it was private, out of state tuition was not more than in-state.) That was about twice what state schools cost at the time..  Now at the same university it's $14k a year tuition.  Room and board is about $8k a year.    Where I live now (Alabama) state universities are about $11k in-state tuition a year, $5k - $9k per year in housing, depending on what you choose."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,AmieSPN,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:21 2015 UTC,Well Big A/Charles wasn't supposed to take over the game from Mona until 3.01 so I am thinking that every thing before that was Mona and her minions.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,FanGirlGrrArrgh,2,Tue Jul 21 04:35:14 2015 UTC,"So I've actually wondered about this scene for a while. We see it in the season 2 finale. Later in that episode, Spencer realizes Mona is A and says something like ""You didn't see Ali spying on A, Ali saw you."" And it's supposed to seem like maybe that's why Ali died. Cuz she caught Mona. Then, at the end of season 4 we see another scene where Ali is teaching Mona to be popular. It happens at the Lost Woods Resort, instead of a bookstore in Brookhaven. I kinda don't think the first scene ever rly happened. It was Mona telling the story when she was hiding that she was A. Not rly a dependable source.   Anyways, to answer your question, yes it was Mona who was sending the messages to Ali before her disappearance."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,tifftuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:10:51 2015 UTC,"I thought Ali pretty much suspected it was Mona, but idk. I feel like after the Halloween episodes there had to be a different A than Mona.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,tifftuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:46:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure as well. Mona was bad but I don't think she ever hurt the girls, did she? She hated them but it seemed it was all in good [twisted] fun. This other A seems a little serious and I honestly think some of the texts where from this other person, well before they ""stole"" the game."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,CascadingFailures_,5,Tue Jul 21 05:16:20 2015 UTC,"Mona ran Hanna over with a car, she killed the Spencer rat to get blood on Ian's trophy, tried to frame Spencer for killing Ali, she threatened to harm Dr Sullivan's son, as a last ditch effort as she was outed as A she was going to push Spencer off the cliff, she made Spencer have a mental breakdown then gloated about it, she was trying to have Jason help push Aria and Garret's bodies off the mystery train while moving, etc.  At times Mona may seem harmless but she had a serious beef with them and  it wasn't all light hearted fun and games with her as A.   But yeah the other A right off the bat steals bodies, sends tooth necklaces, and starts upping the aunty."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,tifftuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:41:05 2015 UTC,And the other A killed his/Charles's and Ali's mother. Like that's pretty f*cked up.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,WriteNite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:24:12 2015 UTC,Yeah a lot more people died with this A at the helm. Though I really wonder how they are going to pull Charles killing his mom off and still making him look sympathetic.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e16hp,tifftuffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:35:34 2015 UTC,"See, that's where it gets weird. I don't think she did, so when the writer say the other A only took over from 3X01 onwards, it wouldn't make a lot of sense.. That's just one example though"

I think Charles is Wren and Big A, but I think Cece has played such a big role I'm holding out for her being Uber A.  I feel Big A and Uber A are antagonists.  We're being made to forget that throughout the last few seasons we have thought there were multiple As and to focus on Charles.  We will think everything has been cleared up and fall under a false sense of security then BAM! As back and this time it's Cece!

They may go back to season 1 to tie some big plots, like that night to Charles. But-- this had nothing to do with him. The song was meant for Hanna"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e122x,CuriousSahm,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:19 2015 UTC,I figured because it does fit the storyline of the episode. But why two different songs? Why outside of Wren's hotel room? Such a weird coincidence and it's kind of a big mess up for it to be a subtitle error because I didn't hear the daddy song played at any other point of the episode.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e122x,cheshyrecatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"That's not what OP is saying. The song playing for Hanna is ""I Don't Need You Anymore"" and the lyrics playing are drastically different to the ones written in the subtitles for ""Who's My Daddy?"". The wrong song is used in the subtitles, and OP is suggesting it could be a hint planted by someone."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ot5,CreepyABCs,10,Tue Jul 21 18:40:08 2015 UTC,I don't think that means he isn't A. Why would they post early pictures of the person playing A? This goes for Cece aswell since you mentioned that Vanessa stated that she's appearing in the finale. There hasn't been any promo pics for her either. Or Lucas since you mentioned him too.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ot5,prettygirluglysecret,7,Tue Jul 21 18:58:52 2015 UTC,Not seeing him in the pics doesn't mean anything. Why would they want to show us wren in a promo pic if he is A?

PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ot5,jokc81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:16 2015 UTC,The actress playing Cece has already stated she's appearing in the finale and so did Lucas and we saw Jason.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ot5,ineedtoknowwhoaisnow,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:17 2015 UTC,That is not proof. It just says that no one has said he is in the finale. Doesn't mean he isn't. Doesn't mean he is. But he is one of the top candidates from the information we have been given.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ot5,AmieSPN,0,Tue Jul 21 19:06:37 2015 UTC,But he never wore a black hoodie. He was not a part of most of the 5 listed episodes. He doesn't fit into the anagram Mona gave the liars.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e3ot5,AmieSPN,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:35 2015 UTC,"The black hoodie quote is misunderstood, the anagram was Charles DiLaurentis, right? If Wren is a fake name he very well could be Charles."

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"Just realized this gives me more questions! Because they never gave us any sort of hint that Charles was in any of the A scenes. Only Red Coat into BW. This makes me think Charles is Red Coat/BW, especially since both birthday cards have the same hand writing (to Jason and Jasons Father) and those hand writings matches Black Widows. Since we are so close to finding the truth, I doubt they would have used the same writer for these 3 things. http://imgur.com/xz52N1i Just a thought though."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,IBelieveInPaybackToo,2,Tue Jul 21 02:16:01 2015 UTC,I don't think they put much thought into the hand writing. the same writing has been seen throughout the series all over even when Mona was A. It's even been seen with different characters writing like the girls and parents. I think Charles is black hoodie. Red coat and BW are completely different people. They might be working with Charles or on their own but they aren't the same as the black hoodie. I personally think CeCe is redcoat and someone else is A/Charles/Black hoodie.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,IBelieveInPaybackToo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:24:55 2015 UTC,Yea good point. I have noticed this writing on the police board and other places. Guess we will see.

(ok, maybe you didn't say all that, but you said to stop using the black hoodie quote)!  But I honestly believe that Marlene and her social media are an extension of the show in that everything she says is a lie.......hence, she is the original PLL!  It's like a theme.  I feel like she just gives lies as answers and as clues, and in the end she can just be like ""well, the show was about lying, so what did you expect!?""  Kindof funny actually"

You can see it at the bottom http://i.imgur.com/AGfdRP3.png
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,ineedtoknowwhoaisnow,0,Tue Jul 21 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"She said it and also mentioned that the REAL actor has played A in the A scenes sometimes.  https://us.beamly.com/tv-news/2015/03/05/pll-creator-marlene-king-accidentally-tweet-massive-hint/  edit: Not starting a war again, but I highly doubt Julian has ever had time to put on that hoodie. We know Keegan (Toby) was often A in A scenes around season 3, and that Vanessa (CeCe) was seen in the A outfit as well (not just hoodie, red coat + hoodie + GLOVES) and it's suspected that it was her nails burning the bubblehead."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,Distortedclarity,2,Tue Jul 21 10:13:51 2015 UTC,Marlene also said that the actor who is playing A just found out a couple of weeks ago (or right before they started filming 6x09 and 6x10) that he is Charles/A. So this can't work with the tweets in the article you linked to.  I think what Marlene is saying with the tweets is the same as with the misinterpreted black hoodie tweet. Sometimes it's A and sometimes it's just a minion of A. Not that the actual actor is in the hoodie or not. But that it's A or not.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,covermaker,0,Tue Jul 21 12:38:46 2015 UTC,"Well, the fact that the real actor has been in the A scenes doesn't mean that the actor knew he/she was A. They could have lied how they use all the actors and sometimes it was their turn to do it etc.  They have said how they use different people and actors in the scenes so that the viewers wouldn't guess the identity by comparing the body builds, that's what they said to the A actor as well. If CeCe was the red nails, they probably just said to Vanessa that since she was available that day that ""we shoot your hands in the A scene today""."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,madame_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:29 2015 UTC,You're stating it as a fact when you say that a real actor has been in the A endings while we don't know that yet.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,TrustMeImAGirl,0,Tue Jul 21 18:27:42 2015 UTC,"Marlene said that. And yes, I quote MARLENE."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0kyd,conallkeenan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:24:25 2015 UTC,I don't believe that. If you have a direct quote I'd be happy to read it.  What you are confusing here is the false interpretation of Marlene's black hoodie quote and the information that different stunt doubles/actors/stand-ins are used in the black hoodie. Up until 6x09 or 6x10 I don't think they used the real Big A for those scenes.

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,tpowpoww,7,Mon Jul 20 20:46:35 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong there are still so much things that were just unnecessary and annoying but not all of them.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,Goodgirl132,5,Mon Jul 20 20:56:31 2015 UTC,I agree. A lot of people complain about Ezra's son-but-not-really-son storyline but I actually really liked it. I wish they would have just kept him as his son though. Dont see why they had to get rid of him.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,tpowpoww,3,Mon Jul 20 21:12:52 2015 UTC,Yea I think he would have been Really good for him...  But the way his character goes from there maybe it was just inappropriate ...more inappropriate then it already was
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,Goodgirl132,6,Mon Jul 20 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"i like filler content, but not filler episodes."

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,fideliusc,14,Mon Jul 20 21:31:52 2015 UTC,I loved Jason and Aria together! I wish she picked him over Ezra. Her dreams of him were hot and even though he is the same age as Ezra not ever being her teacher or using her would have made him a way better choice!
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,plltwin,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:42 2015 UTC,Preach!

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,prettylilhanna,26,Mon Jul 20 20:50:24 2015 UTC,Noel is criminally underused in this show. They waste way too much time on boring male characters when he has a great delivery and can pull off a complex half-douche/half-ally role.

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,ashwhenn,9,Tue Jul 21 14:06:19 2015 UTC,Toby and Paige are my least favourite characters in all of TV history. Paige looks like a foot. Toby too. Emily and Spencer must have foot fetishes because I can't imagine why they'd have been in a relationship with either of them.

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,covermaker,3,Tue Jul 21 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed,He has had some cheesy lines but so has Spencer and she is great.I thought it was funny when she said stop looking at me like I am the town pump but did not sound right coming from her in my opinion .Just like it is Andrew babe did not sound right out of Toby's mouth.Does not make him a bad actor."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,plltwin,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:34 2015 UTC,i think it started when he became a cop after a week of school!
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,gingaflo,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:58 2015 UTC,I think actors are not good in every role and I agree being a cop is not a good role for him to play.But I think he was great as Mona's helper and creepy guy who girls thought was after them when he first showed up.Also when he was upset over his mom and he broke my heart when he cried in alley over little kids crossing street to get away from him. But yeah they should not have made him a cop.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,plltwin,4,Tue Jul 21 03:10:58 2015 UTC,"I don't really mind Sara Harvey, at all. I think she's going to be integral to the plot. oops.   Also, I like Keegan's acting and I like Toby too."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,1ims,4,Mon Jul 20 23:32:58 2015 UTC,I actually like Sara Harvey

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,Allie_Girl,2,Mon Jul 20 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"I like Toby. I think neither Cece nor Wren is  the big A (A team, not A)"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,kkh03,2,Mon Jul 20 22:41:57 2015 UTC,"I think Toby is actually a really interesting character. That whole scrabble thing was to show that Toby can compete with Spencer intellectually. He's been through so much psychological trauma what with being raped by his step-sister, thinking his mother killed herself, etc. Not to mention, he was on the A-team and likely hasn't told us everything he knows. It's really too bad that the acting for Toby isn't better...no offense to Keegan."

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,gingaflo,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:43 2015 UTC,"I think Sara is traumatized, not weird. And her haircut suits her. The tattoos and kissing were still dumb, though, and I don't totally trust her."

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,MonasLawyer,10,Mon Jul 20 21:17:25 2015 UTC,"Ezra and Aria being on the A-team together was my dream for the longest time. I liked the idea of Aria not knowing she's A, it being another personality or whatever, so Ezra has to deal with these two different sides of her.  When they first, supposedly, revealed Ezra as A, I was hoping that Aria would find out and confront him, and he'd say something along the lines of, ""But you're A too!"""

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,monaforever,3,Tue Jul 21 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"i can't help but feel like ezria is a particularly dangerous dynamic. i'm not saying what was done with the other characters was correct, but they never even properly addressed how the couple worked through these trust issues. one episode they are friends working to find A (with a couple 'slips) and by christmas they are dating with no explanation. and they are perceived as an 'end game' couple, which is something that paige and emily never were. alison was given the amount of heat she deserved, i still think mona's actions were unforgivable, i don't remember toby doing anything that terrible (other than his stint of trying to protect spencer) and paige was never portrayed as an end-game relationship and at least her incident was truly a one-time thing with an explanation. sorry. </end rant>"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmaf,gingaflo,3,Tue Jul 21 02:48:49 2015 UTC,"""Trying to protect Spencer"" where he did more actual damage than good. More damage than Ezra ever did. He actively worked for A. Helped in A's plots against the girls. Went along with faking his death to put his GF in the nut house. Lied to his GF the entire time as he stalked her and her friends. And got absolutely no helpful information while he was at it. Essentially he did the exact same thing Ezra did except worse bc he was helping A where as Ezra was just gathering info for a book. And Spencer did the same thing where she forgave him almost instantly without actually talking about it. My like for Ezra has nothing to do with his relationship with Aria though. I just like him as a character. I don't give a shit about Ezria. I don't want to get into it though because I don't give a shit what anyone else thinks about it. This is about unpopular opinions and that's mine. I know all the complaints against him and I don't care."

Nobody at my job thinks this is possible, but I will post it anyway... I think Season 1 has the ultimate Charles answer....  In To Kill a Mockingbird, Boo Radley was a misunderstood guy who people thought was bad.  In the end he turned out to be good.  What if the real Charles is still alive but Red Coat (good) and Wren and Melissa are A and Black Veil.  Wren is pretending to be Charles... His mother was Marion Cavanaugh, and he thought Charles killed his mother so he assumed his identity and swore to destroy Charles.  When Mrs. D found out, she sent Charles away and faked his suicide.  Wren wanted to get revenge so he was going to kill Allison, the sister Charles mistakenly was blamed for trying to kill.  Melissa saw Wren try to kill Allison, so they became lovers.  Wren didn't want to be accidently recognized so he assumed the British identity, and when he found out Allison was alive from Mona in Radley, he took over the game.  He tortured the liars to draw Allison out, and became obsessed after that...  He knew his only chance to kill her would be if she was captured or her friends were, so he captured the Liars and tried to lure Allison out... The real Charles is going to come back at the season finale and save the girls from his cousin (and Allisons) and die in the process.  Melissa will be revealed as Black Widow, who's identity she assumed to stop being a target of Wrens (since she is Jason's brother and he hates all Charles family). He also hates the liars for the Jenna thing BC it put Toby in juvi, but its mostly just him using them and putting them in danger to lure Allison out.  Toby is A team because his older brother is Wren!!!"

Any way you slice it, Ezra SHOULD be in jail.  You can hate a character without hating the actor portraying them. I have this pet peeve where it pisses me off when people can't separate a character from the actor playing them. This sends me through the roof when interviewers ask questions like ""What went through your mind when you went into the enchanted forest and fell into the bottomless pit?"" Yes the actor had thoughts about it, but you are not going to get the insight you are looking for with questions like that."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dxyl2,thegArddner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:43 2015 UTC,Oh no I know. Wilden for example- hated the character but love Bryce. Same thing with Ryan Merriman. But it's something that Ian Harding brings to the actual character of Ezra that makes it hard for me to hate him. Honestly- the whole teacher/student thing didn't bother me as much. Yes- it was wrong. But what pushed me over the edge with Ezra's character is that he KNEW who Aria was when he met her. He knew how young she was. That made a huge difference than him not knowing when they first met. But the stalking...the fact that he did NOTHING to help the girls from being terrorized. That's where I hold my issue. Truthfully- I was hoping that he would end up being Charles. It would validate how wrong the relationship with Aria is. But Marlene has a hard on for Ezria so they are most likely endgame. Which honestly- if they had broken apart earlier on and then came back together when she was older- totally different beast.

His relationship with Aria seemed sort of romantic at first and then it got really inappropriate. :/
PrettyLittleLiars,3dxyl2,wr3nKingston,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Mmh... Ezra isn't a pedophile. You'll need to check your definition for ""pedophile""."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dxyl2,ezriafan101,0,Mon Jul 20 19:43:49 2015 UTC,Ok... Then he's a 20 something teacher perusing a relationship with a (at the time 16) year old student and ends up having a sexual relationship with her while she's still underage. What do you call that? To me it's pedo status. If it was your daughter would you think her teacher was a pedo? If not then you prob shouldn't have kids lol
PrettyLittleLiars,3dxyl2,wr3nKingston,4,Mon Jul 20 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"Pedophilia--primary/exclusive attraction to prepubescent children Hebephilia--primary/exclusive attraction to pubescent children Ephebophilia--primary/exclusive attraction to mid to late adolescents  I agree that their relationship was extremely inappropriate, but Ezra is not a pedophile. I don't even think he could be considered an ephebophile because he's had relationships with adult women as well. Also, in Pennsylvania, the age of consent is 16, so Aria wouldn't be considered underage. There are laws about teachers sleeping with their students, but I don't think they had sex while he was still her teacher (although I could be wrong--it's been a long time.) He could definitely be fired and possibly even lose his teaching license for dating Aria, but I don't think he could be arrested.   Like I said though, their relationship was still very inappropriate and unethical on Ezra's part. Just because someone recognizes that Ezra is not a pedophile, that doesn't mean they think his relationship with Aria is okay or would support their child dating a teacher, and it's kind of rude of you to assume they have that opinion and tell them they shouldn't have kids."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dxyl2,ezriafan101,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really sick of people calling him pedophile, it's ridiculous. I don't care if you dislike him or find him creepy. A pedophile is a COMPLETELY different thing. Ezra is not attracted to children who haven't hit puberty. Ezra has dated two woman of his own age (and probably more we just obviously don't know every relationship), so he's not just attracted to teenagers. You shouldn't even make the assumption that he's just attracted to teenagers. He didn't even know Ali WAS a teenager, he thought she was his age. When he found out, he ended it. Aria is literally the only one that he's been with. I'm not saying any of it is okay, but it's not like Ezra was just a teacher that met Aria at school and started hitting on her because she's hot, then did the same thing with a bunch of other HS girls. Like and people realize Aria and Ezra weren't even having sex until months into their relationship, after he quit being a teenager and after he quit the book, right? If he was just some creep, especially those who call him a pedo and a manipulator, wouldn't he have been able to easily find a way to sleep with her?"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dxyl2,wr3nKingston,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:43 2015 UTC,"What about the other girls that he was watching without their knowledge? using Aria for her friends. Ive had a very creepy peeping tom situation at my last apartment complex that got a bit too much to handle. I wasn't receiving threatening messages, having people commit suicide, getting run over by cars, locked in a dollhouse or anything. It was a stranger I guess who must have been leaving a friends or something in my complex, and saw me thru my window and started watching me. Thats what Im just assuming cause they never caught the creep. The cops were called one night he was there and he ran off, but I KNOW that wasn't the first time, because I swore I once a face one time at night thru the blinds but it was a small crack and I just thought i was tripping. And I'd find cigarette butts in the saw by the patio and window.  The cops came again 2 weeks later for the same thing cause the neighbor above me who had called the cops before recognized the guy in the parking lot, but I wasn't home. I moved like asap outta there. Now compared to PLL World.. ya thats nothing. Someone who for a couple weeks is seen basically stalking you. I was never physically attacked. But I'm not going to lie, I was kinda freaking out. It was an emotional thing. Id think of all the moments at night when I thought I was alone, and silly innocent things become dirty. That guy took a bit of innocence I had for at the world. For a while all I could think about was what I had been doing that he might of seen. . And for the beginning I didn't even know it. Once I found out I felt so violated. I kept having friends over until I moved out about a month after it first started happening. Now Im sorry if me referring to Ezra as a pedo for lack of a better word has upset you, and clearly this is an issue you feel so strongly about that because IDK maybe you and ezra relate because you've slept with an underage girl and stalked her,  but the facts are he got a job at the school SIMPLY to get close with these 4 girls. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GIRLS PRIVACY HE VIOLATED?! His fascination with his book about Alison, the underage mystery girl, evolves into a lair  documenting everything the 4 friends are doing. Now if I was 16 and i found out that the man outside my apartment complex was actually my secret boyfriend/teacher and he got his job to get close to me and my 3 underaged friends and had planted security cameras and had secret lairs dedicated to my life... I would describe him as a pedo. He prayed on young girls. and about your ""he dated older girls so He has no pediphilic actions"" have you ever heard of a beard? Tons of gay men dated women and were even married while they were sneaking around with men. Does that mean they aren't gay because they married someone who's a female? No. And we all know the only reason they backtracked on when they had sex first was because the show is on ABCFamily, if this was on any other network... nah bro they def fucked in that bathroom. Who only makes out in a bar bathroom? NO ONE ha I think you should give up the fight defending pedos and maybe find a cause actually worth fighting for. Ezra prayed on young underage girls. Thats a pedophile. THANK YOU!"

Jenna RAPED her step brother, but people don't say shit about that.   I feel like everyone defending that word are people who have stalked and fucked 16 year old and are defending their friends actions. SMH at y'all.    You need to sit you ass down my gosh. People are defending that word because it's NOT THE SAME THING. A pedophile is sexually attracted to children 11 years and younger.

But the truth is, he fits more with the pedo word than any other. So maybe the actual word doesn't describe him perfectly but it gets the point I'm making across. I feel like everyone defending that word are people who have stalked and fucked 16 year old and are defending their friends actions. SMH at y'all.

And the fact that HE KNEW ABOUT HER ALREADY AND STILL PURSUED A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP!!! SMH at everyone on here defending this man cause he's cute. Scott Peterson was attractive, so should we forgive him for murder? hahaha NO! and if Aria was my daughter and I found all this out, I would have had him arrested for sure. I would press as many charges of statutory rape as I could. But the parents on this show are absolutely the worst examples of parents you could possibly have."

I dont know any of your ages, but when the Internet became popular,  way back in the day.   AOL was huge, they had chat room, much like reddit. Each was devoted to different topics.  These  type of people have been around that long.  You always had the random person showing up making some off the wall comments.  Gosh, i am really dating myself here.  The only way you knew anything about the person was if they had a profile.  Anyway,  I just find it funny all these years later with how far we have come, we are basically in an AOL chat site.

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0jwq,tifftuffs,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"Lol, that is because our new trolls are children who have no idea what that means.  They probably aren't old enough to remember pre-wifi. We used to be tied to a computer to be online,  now with the advances in technology,  we can be on anywhere and still be online.  My husband works in the middle of the gulf, and he can still get online.   That is just crazy!  I think back to the movie ""back to the future II""  and predicting the future.   They got a few things right looking 30 years ahead.  Were are we going to be in 30 years?  I will be in my 60's, well on my way to 70.  That is a scary thought.  :("

PrettyLittleLiars,3e0jwq,Eddy1504,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:27 2015 UTC,No she's actually not. People just don't like her because she's very outspoken about believing Wren is A. Just like many of the CeCe theorists in this very thread are very outspoken and annoying about it but we don't go around calling those users trolls. Now these users are down voting every single thing Hannabanana says no matter what it is and going on to her posts just to talk shit to her. So who are the trolls now?
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0jwq,IBelieveInPaybackToo,2,Tue Jul 21 06:29:41 2015 UTC,"Well. I'm sure she is. Her comments are written in the exact same way as the trolls comments. Stuff like ""Im looking forward to say to you: I have told you"" , or ""Cece is a dropped character"" or ""Have fun being disappointed after the finale :)"". I'm not talking about her having an outspoken opinion against Cece, but she uses the exact same wording.  Plus she randomly appeared seconds after the troll session ended.  I'm not downvoting everything she says. I can't speak for other persons, but I agree to disagree."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0jwq,Eddy1504,2,Tue Jul 21 09:27:30 2015 UTC,"It definately is..why would the troll account go out of its way to tell me Hanna isn't her account. We can easily look at the times as well. The CeCe bash post debate occured, she got mad and started posting troll threads. Her main account went silent this entire time. As soon as the mods banned the troll, she pops up immediately and posts to try and throw people off. It's so clear as day.  Edit; I know you agree, I was just adding to your post not implying you weren't aware."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e0jwq,IBelieveInPaybackToo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:15:46 2015 UTC,"Imma just try to avoid her threads from now on. Her behaviour is way too overdramatic for my taste, we should just ignore her.  Otherwise we're gonna be accused of being trolls, like monaforever said."

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,madame_,5,Tue Jul 21 14:08:27 2015 UTC,And her name starts with A! And there's a history of mental illness in her family!
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,C0urtneyy,10,Mon Jul 20 20:57:16 2015 UTC,Byron insinuated that his brother had depression which is a long stretch for Aria to have inherited a mental illness that causes her to be A and torture herself and her friends though..
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,madame_,4,Mon Jul 20 22:10:36 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you. Just stating what is commonly said by those who believe that Aria is A
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,sammyxorae,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"This exact reason is why I don't understand the whole bringing Scott Montgomery into the picture thing. I mean, I understand that they've brought other characters that were mentioned once into play, but I really don't think they would use a character, who was only insinuated as having a mental illness, into the picture.  On top of that, this little but of info is being used to say that Charles is Marion and Scott's kid. I think it's a little far fetched, but I give props to those who come up with these ideas!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,madame_,3,Mon Jul 20 23:10:00 2015 UTC,They mentioned Scott to explain what was going on with Mike. Mike having depression is then what led him into that support group at school where he met Mona and the rest was history.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,grngtts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:10 2015 UTC,THIS THIS THISSSS people keep using Scott Montgomery's illness to tie him/Aria/the Montgomery family to Charles (calling him crazy and such) but he had depression and that is not at all the same thing!!'
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,katiealaska,13,Tue Jul 21 04:33:29 2015 UTC,"I personally think the writers are just showing her struggling with her identity. She was kind of like ""the free spirit"" of the group, especially in the beginning of the series when she was keeping her Ezra thing a secret and going behind everyone's back and just kinda doing her own things, but then when A traps her in the doll house, she loses that sense of identity. She looks in mirrors because she is trying to figure out who she is, and photographs dolls because she feels like she has been treated like a doll. In Psychology, from the ages of 12 to 18 one goes through a stage of Identity vs Role Confusion (According to Erikson), and I think people are misinterpreting a normal human stage and her reaction to being help captive by A as her having multiple personality disorder."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,sammyxorae,3,Mon Jul 20 21:56:47 2015 UTC,I appreciate that you're using psychological evidence to explain why Aria is acting the way she is! How many times did Norman Buckley say that he's loves incorporating the psychological aspect of things when he can?! This is probably just one of them!
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,ScarletteSilver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:51 2015 UTC,Aria has been looking in the mirrors since the pilot episode. One scene of her wearing the dress that looks like the doll she found in the pilot was mirrored in 3x01

Lol But that girl is beyond shady. The amount of evidence against her keeps piling since season 3. She may not be -A but she's guilty of something. I'm sure all of my post aggravates the nonbelievers but it's cool! All theorists are just squirrels trying to get a nut. Lol"

PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,selene623,3,Tue Jul 21 01:20:57 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't think she's A, but I think there is still something Aria knows that hasn't come to light yet. Anyway, here we go.   Until now, A pretty much left Aria alone. (Yes, yes, I know she had to fight a stapler.) Ezra mentioned leaving some stuff out of his book to protect Aria, but we still don't know what that is. Ali always talks about having chosen Aria. There's not an obvious connection as to why they are even friends. Spencer competed with Ali and shares a brother, Hanna wanted to be her, Emily was in love with her, and Aria...? I'm not sure if it's actually relevant, but there's that screencap floating around with Aria emailing someone about a fence project. She also wrote something about Hanna in her diary that she didn't actually know about yet. Aria has lost people even while holding their hands.   There's a couple of other things that are actually better evidence, but I'll leave it there for now."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,jilliefish,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:27 2015 UTC,And she killed (I forget her name).... Maybe just before she was going to reveal aria's secret?!
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,YumFreeCookies,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"There's a few things. The biggest one for me is that there are times where her reality doesn't match with the rest. In the episode where the girls go to the zoo while Aria is at Ezra's cabin, her timeline is all fucked up - in Arias timeline it goes from ay to night from one second to the next, and it's a different time than the girl's time at the zoo. Also, on the Halloween train she writes ARIA and the last A is exactly as A signs it. Mona slo refers to her as ""Big A"". Her doll is wearing a hoodie at the end of one of the episodes.  You should just look up Aria is A theories and they'll show you a bunch of reasons. I don't think she's A, but I do think her character is ""off"" at times...now this could be real or just bad writing, who knows..."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,dymphnawolf,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think Aria gets off easier compared to the rest. These are the points I see raised most often: Ezra is still around, rather than get arrested (unlike the books, I may add). Her parent's marriage did fall apart, but that was doomed to happen anyway. No serious physical injuries (Hanna got hit by a car, Spencer went all drug crazy and Emily's shoulder).   And there is Emily's rant from 'A Dark Ali'   When? When wasn't I there? When Hanna broke her leg because of ""A""? When I almost died in an elevator because I was trying to find out who killed you? Or when Spencer had to check into Radley because of everything your disappearance put us through? The past several years haven't been easy for any of us, but what makes it okay is that we stick together.   Note the lack of Aria being mentioned. That always bugged me."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,TrustMeImAGirl,3,Mon Jul 20 23:56:05 2015 UTC,"I dislike the ""hint"" being Emily's speech. Mostly because Emily wouldn't be leaving Aria out because she's A. Emily wouldn't know. I get that ""Oh well the writers did it."" But Emily is the one saying it. When you watch a show, that's how you're supposed to take it.  (Hope that didn't come off as rude...)"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,dymphnawolf,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"It didn't!  I don't think Aria is A, but I think she does have a connection to A somehow, whether she knows it or not, like everyone else probably does. I also think that Emily doesn't think Aria is A. That speech bugs me, though. It was probably just a writer's error rather than a hint or a sort of nod to a part of the fandom. If it had been written pre season 4b, I would have assumed it meant Ezra was A."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,TrustMeImAGirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely get that! I wonder if she got left off because at that point there wasn't some quick thing to say? Like ""Or when Aria almost got murdered on the train?"" If that makes sense."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,dymphnawolf,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:10 2015 UTC,"They could have said something about the train! It can be quickly said, likely exactly how you wrote it or close to it. So why they decided not to throw in Aria just sits weird with me. Is it a hint? Or did the writers forget and no one bothered to fix it because it was too late?"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,glitterinwonderland,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:41 2015 UTC,It could be a clue or hint or whatever without it meaning that Emily or the writers knew Aria was A. That just when the girls think of everything they go through they can't think of anything really bad that happened to Aria compared to the rest of them.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,grngtts,2,Tue Jul 21 02:42:40 2015 UTC,It also is interesting to me that she kisses Ezra's brother and yet A never found out or used it against her
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,dymphnawolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"I forgot about that! And the whole Shana thing, though one could say that A wanted Shana out of the picture anyway.   But yeah, that was weird."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,grngtts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's sloppy writing that makes Aria look suspicious for the most part. Lots of plot lines are dropped and not tied up + just like with what they're doing with Emily now they did with Aria then (keeping her involved with a love interest and not with the sleuthing) But hey, I guess in like 3 weeks we'll have hopefully some concrete answers"
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,glitterinwonderland,2,Tue Jul 21 04:50:41 2015 UTC,I think she gets it easy compared to the other Liars. She had a relationship with Ezra that he never got in trouble for. Ezra and her told her parents about it rather than A doing it. No one has found out that Aria killed Shana. It hasn't been brought up again. It was self defense but I mean A blackmails and convicts people of murders that they were not involved in/didn't even happen. So it seems strange that she is the closest one to actually murder someone and it's completely ignored by A. Is she A? I don't think so but who really knows. I personally think she would be too boring of a character to be A.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,prettylilhanna,3,Tue Jul 21 02:47:48 2015 UTC,Because she was the least tortured out of the girls. She is also obsessed with mirrors and photographing dolls so people assume she is suffering from either multiple or distinct personality disorder.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,madame_,8,Mon Jul 20 20:47:49 2015 UTC,Now everyone thinks she's shady because she's the only one being tortured out of the girls lol.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,prettylilhanna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:05 2015 UTC,Whatever Aria goes through she will always be blamed :D
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,soph876,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:29 2015 UTC,"the_pll_sherlock on IG has some provocative posts today about Aria & clowns. not sure if s/he (them?) is (are?) on here, but that account continually blows my mind."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,monaforever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:14 2015 UTC,I don't get it either. But I also don't get what people are talking about when they say Ezra is being shady.
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,whimrocker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"It's interesting. There are a lot of Aria clues, but I just don't feel like what they're hinting at is evil. I definitely don't buy her as A.  I personally always thought Emily was the shady one."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,spencers_pot_brownie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:09 2015 UTC,"Because anyone who sleeps around with their teacher secretly and then continues to pursue a relationship with them even after you have found out they are creepy is shady as hell. Also, no one knows what she did in Iceland."
PrettyLittleLiars,3dzmv9,NoodlyPuddles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"I've recently gone back and watched the first few episodes again knowing some of these theories and I think in the first couple of episodes Aria and Ezra have some conversations which could be interpreted as about hiding their relationship OR as them talking as if they are both A. They don't mention specifics just about ""lying to people"", ""keeping secrets"", ""feeling bad about it"", etc. I'm not necessarily set on Aria is A but I think those conversations could be taken two different ways."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,Ronlovesu17,7,Mon Jul 20 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"I totally agree! The show isnt really good written. The acting with a few exceptions is avarage and the plot is a mess. I'm really thankful for the hiatus so I can try to make sense of the plot for me, and maybe, if the preview of the timejump at the end of 6x10 is good I might continue watching. But first I wanna just get over with this Big A plot and then I need a break."
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,Eddy1504,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:04 2015 UTC,Yass I need a break too.!
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,Rosewoodsfinest,2,Mon Jul 20 22:38:48 2015 UTC,I think I will too. Depends if the cliffhanger reels me. However if most of the questions aren't answered I don't care how enticing the cliffhanger is I won't be waching anymore pll. So far it seems that none of the questions are going to be answered besides who A is and who killed mrs. D.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,Witthoeft,2,Mon Jul 20 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"I won't. At least, I will give it a chance!"
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,emilysfinechina,2,Mon Jul 20 23:29:12 2015 UTC,I'm thinking the same but I bet 6B & 7 are actually gonna be well thought out idk how I feel about the time jump though.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,bananabae,2,Mon Jul 20 23:31:58 2015 UTC,I'll definitely stop after the Charles reveal. I could not care less about ships or random new characters. I've already wasted enough time on Shower and Lesli and Clark and Egg and Talia and the whole irrelevant gang. The time jump just seems like fan service. As if the writers need to press the reset button and start a new story when they have so many loose ends already.
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,Potterlove,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:57 2015 UTC,I think I'd just wait until the entire thing to come out to watch the last season and a half. I won't put in the effort of etching every week and waiting for the next week's episode
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,bloves123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:14:05 2015 UTC,Do we know anything about what's in season 7? I'd love it to be the story from A's perspective rather than the liars 20-something lives
PrettyLittleLiars,3e00mh,faedreams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:11:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know about season 7 but I'll be watching 6B. I have no clue what the point is of S7 is and I'd like to believe that there isn't A in  S7. It makes sense for new characters in 6B, though. It's a 5 year time jump and they'll be going to college and moving places and what not so they will of course be meeting new people, and there will be new people in Rosewood (why would you move there after this mess!) I don't think there will be an A in 6B either but I'm not sure what they will be doing in that half of the season."
