ENFP,3e5via,AttackOnTightPanties,6,Wed Jul 22 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"Life hint for everything: you're never the only one.    Life hint for everything #2: diversify your sources of information.    As I already said, MBTI is not 100% accurate, you will NEVER (and hear me out clearly on this) completely agree with a description of any type in the world. As well as you will never completely disagree. You're a complex person, with your own personnality, your own story, nobody will be exactly like you. Even twins are differents. Even siameses are differents. MBTI will give you general guidelines, and just that.    Also, the MBTI is a way of describing the thougt and emotion process of your brain, not your entire personnality. Of course they're linked in some way in our head, but because you know one thing, it doesn't mean you can guess the other one. You can have clue, you can think about some specific things, but that's all. Unless you seriously study it, you'll never exactly know what's going in your mind.    You have to understand how MBTI works. ENFPs aren't all ""fairies who like rainbows"", but they're all (well... almost all, because...y'know) people who look at the big picture instead of (or before) looking at the details. Because that's function-related, it's a process of the brain, how it deals with information. It nevers defines your tastes, or your personnality.  If I say that the majority of the people living in Africa is black, you'll agree with me (I hope). But there are a lot of white people in South Africa. And they still are african. What suits the majority doesn't necessarily suit you.    But if you still have some doubts, go do some researches. There are good links in the sidebars, use google, go to Personnality Cafe and ask them to type you (all you have to do is to answer one of the proposed questionnaire), go to forums and discuss about it with other people."

I hate showing emotion in public but that day I screamed and shouted and raged at everyone from the public to staff at the resort to my husband.   The days and weeks after I went from feeling numb to being inconsolable. In front of family it was easy-ish, but even still I felt guilty for crying. I was meant to be strong, for mum and my little sister. I dealt with his estate and funeral plans  You'll feel a range of emotions. Anger and denial. I remember thinking it wasn't real. It was a dream. Guilt. Why did I disappoint him so much. Why him, when there are awful people left in the world. I still struggle with that one. Why him.   I mourn the loss of the future and the dreams I had of me putting right all the wrongs. The plans for being an awesome father daughter team, starting a business so he could retire from the manual labour he'd worked out of school.   And then there's the loss. The gaping hole in dinners and holidays that nothing can ever, will ever, fill.   It hurts, you'll feel numb. You have to experience it all otherwise you'll end up trapped in grief and whichever stage of grief hurts the most. Block it out and you'll end up stuck.   Cry in private.  Eat junk.

ENFP,3dyqks,wenttoofar,11,Mon Jul 20 16:55:43 2015 UTC,"I think ENFPs can sometimes be a little shy too sometimes, my hunch is that it comes from a common worry about people not liking us. ENFPs want to get along with others and as such are concerned about what others think of them, generally speaking.   I would actually think that being 'extremely blunt' is probably a less ENFP-ish quality than shyness. I think that ENFPs usually proceed delicately in social situations, again because we care a lot about how others view us. If you're younger, however, that could simply be a function of age that will balance and develop over time.  Altogether, testing as one type doesn't necessarily mean you have to be that type, but it is a good place to start looking.

I guess that a lot of confusion comes from stereotypes of introverts and extroverts, people assume that extroverts need to be loud, talkative and social and see introverts as quiet, shy, timid etc. and although there is probably some sort of correlation to support this, it isn't what defines your type, there are plenty of shy extroverts and talkative introverts. You say that you love people so you're probably ENFP (or an extrovert at least), it's just that your shyness is perhaps holding you back from acting how you truly want."

Our high skill at knowing what other people are thinking goes against us when we try to reverse engineer it in this way.  Basically, stick to reality. Look at the things within your power and apply yourself to them. It's naturally the hardest thing for ENFPs to do but it's probably the one that will get you the best results.

It's great to just dump my brain's contents into my bullet journal. I also follow the 2 minute rule (if it can be done in two minutes, do it now). Turning things into rituals is good too, I use different days for different areas of the house or types of chores. I play loud music and have a little treat at the end as a reward."
ENFP,3dx0br,CotardCanard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:10:46 2015 UTC,"Ha, in school/college, I was notoriously awful with details and punctuality. The corporate world turned into that ""trial by fire"" sink-or-swim moment where I was forced to get organized. The overarching principle – make everything you do about limiting information overload.  That's why at the core of it all, I use a tagging system based on some advice I saw in this Lifehacker article. This way, when I need info, I go into whatever app I'm using and go for the relevant tag (and I try to use the same tags across all my apps). Otherwise, I'll get distracted by info from other things in my life, then get distracted by more stuff, then get nothing done.  Inbox by Google is really good for this on email. It requires a Gmail account, but it provides a more bundle/folder-based way of visualizing your email. All my work stuff stays together in one bundle, while stuff from family is another bundle, friend emails is in the ""Friend"" bundle, etc.  What a lot of people are saying already on apps is awesome advice. Apps, with their shiny, attention-grabbing push notifications are good at keeping me on task. I've tried any.do and Sunshine, but my favorites are Wunderlist (Great across mobile and desktop) and Google Calendar. Then, I just use Evernote for jotting down quick bits of information, be it in meetings or on the go.  Finally, as for being detail-oriented, this can get scary. I've gone through my own depression after a period of being a clean and organized neat freak. It's tough to get back on the horse from that. Here's how I did it – I make heavy use of checklists to keep my thoughts organized and my execution perfect.  I just use a spreadsheet editor – Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Numbers – all of them are great. Before I do anything at work that requires immense attention to detail, I sit down and brainstorm in Google Sheets. I think about everything that needs to be absolutely right. I also think about everything that can go wrong. I'm kinda doing the Freakonomics podcast once called a ""premortem"" (here's the transcript.)  You want to imagine you're in the future where you've already failed at a task and you're thinking about all the things you wish you could've done right. Of course, by the time you're done, you're back in the present and the opportunity to do everything right is staring at you on the checklist in Google Sheets!  Once you got a list of all the important things to check/avoid, go through and initial each one as you do/don't do it. Make notes if you feel something is amiss. The point of all of this is not so you have something to turn into a superior. It's there for you as a way of saying ""Yeah, I did this and this and this.""  And above all else – take a mental break whenever you can! Recharge those brain cells by taking a walk, eating a small snack, whatever. Thoroughness and details don't come naturally to us, but technology, good humor, and some occasional R&R can help boost your skills."

I picked something intriguing enough, made a decision to do it, brought my intrinsic passion to the table, and therefore I enjoy it.   Truth is, most people aren't swept up by passion specific to a job worthy subject. Yet they expect that of themselves. I'm no different. It doesn't matter what you put me in front of, I want to do well, and get a lot of satisfaction from that. My passion is general, non specific. It's just the guts I carry.   And I accept that there likely will never be something that I become completely obsessed with beyond just seeing how far I can push myself in any direction. My life is much more comfortable to live when I allow my end goal to be a bit fuzzy. And as I get better at what I do, it becomes more and more engaging and fun. The only exception is if I really HATE what I'm doing. Like...I hate wet lab work and pipetting nonsense.   So just pick something that doesn't irritate the hell out of you, fits into the life you want to live, and make it engaging for yourself. Then see where life leads.   *I realize that this behavior probably is learned form a number of pep talks with my ISTJ dad. But he was right in many senses.

Do I want to be working a 9 to 5 job at some firm where I'm just another statistic to be dealt with at the end-of-year performance reviews? Absolutely not.  I chose to do engineering because I want to help change the world and I want to make a decent living out of it.  But each day I wake up with this nagging feeling at the back of mind about getting the short end of the stick. I'm torn between the practicalities of the modern world and my endless dreaming. What I'm trying to say is that you need to compromise. I think most ENFPs understand the need to compromise more than anyone; we have to keep adjusting so that we can adapt to each new circumstance. slaving away at a 9 to 5 job that isn't particularly enjoyable means that you can pursue your wordly desires, then I say go for it. That's what I feel right now. We don't live in a utopia where we can pick and choose what we want from life. We get dealt a hand and we choose how best to play it so that we don't get completely fucked over.

Being dumped is a painful experience but it's followed by a newfound appreciation for people that are very clearly more loyal and trustworthy than your past ""friends"" or ""lovers"".   It's a process, a painful and sometimes slow one but healing takes time, there's no rush to get back out there, just take your time and once you've gotten past those trust issues and resentment, you'll gradually get back to being the eccentric and overbearing enfp that we've all grown to love."

You deserve unwavering love that comes from within.   But shit, alone = isolated right now. In our best times and our worst times, we should have the company of loved ones gathered around us. Avoid people? No. Avoid this guy. He's the fickle affection, forced standards one. You need people, OTHER people.   You weep with others when they are down, let them weep with you. You deserve a hug right now. From your friends, your mom, whomever. Letting other people back in helps you let the guy go."

I'm just not, and I'm tired of people acting like I'm defective because of that. What I really hear whenever someone says this is, ""You'd better be happy alone because that's all you'll ever be."" I know what they're really saying is ""People are attracted to happiness, and your sadness will drive everyone away."" But that won't change the fact that I'm miserable. And I'm miserable because I'm lonely. And the only way to make that loneliness go away is to be with someone. This misery goes against my nature, and it makes me feel like a broken toy."

Really? Learn to love being isolated?  Now I don't think that being alone should give anyone crippling anxiety, and I would never encourage people to cling to those who make them feel isolated in a crowd, or do them wrong, but being alone is not a natural state of being for people. We're social creatures. Especially extroverts.   I mean, hey. Everyone has their social quota for the week. I've got mine, and I am acutely miserable having anything less than that. It doesn't have to come all from the same person. It doesn't have to come from a significant other. But damn it, I need some meaningful human contact with my friends at a minimum.   Telling a sad person who already feels isolated that they should just learn to like it, feels more like a turned back than a comfort. Miscommunication and poorly expressed intentions everywhere."

It goes beyond just needing to be around people. I need to know I've got that one person I can count on when it seems like the rest of the world is against me. I need to feel needed in the same way.

Be strong and surround yourself with people who are willing to listen you out, regardless of how many times you mention him. After a while, you'll be annoyed at yourself because you keep mentioning him and slowly , but surely, you'll stop talking about him. After a while he won't be a thought in your mind.

Just as liquid water can become ice while remaining H2O, you will always remain who you are and the retain the way you think despite changing your perception of your own position in life. Moving on from relationships is one of the hardest things we humans have to endure in our lives. At one point, being happy with an SO was a state of mind. At the state you're in now, you're feeling introverted and alone. There is another state that exists in which you are happy and excited to explore. The hardest part is finding that transition point, but don't ever forget that the new, happy state exists right now, you just need to find it. And we'll keep you company along the way!"

I am also a female ENFP so I know.   ahh jesus christ, I am dating a male intp. I am still dating him but things are rocky because of all the underlying things you mentioned. he has all of the classical INTP qualities. (can't get dressed well, doesn't care about being presentable, bad at communicating, forgetful, messy, etc) over time i have started to low level hate intps because they feel like emotional parasites. they are fiercely independent and seldom self reflect on interpersonal matters bc those activities are deemed a waste of time to the intp mind. this makes it so you'll have to go out of your way to understand them and compromise more to them. most intps seem really unwilling to compromise their dearly protected alone time. they will often not meet the emotional needs of others bc they can't perceive those things well and react with logic/solutions only. intps need so much hand holding on everything that doesn't happen inside their heads. other than in intellectual realms, I see them sometimes as socially unfit recluses. an unintelligible and unaccomplished intp would just be a slacker.   basically, many of them lack the skills to make differences easier in a relationship and sometimes might benefit from dating an intj or being alone."

ENFP,3drk44,Chai_wali,3,Sun Jul 19 11:06:40 2015 UTC,"I got this before I became depressed. Depression isn't feeling sad all the time, more like you feel tired easily and like you just aren't yourself. The first mini episode I had was like I fog and I could barely remember any of it, or just really patchily.   Make sure you do stuff like running/ exercise to just get the cobwebs out. Really look after yourself (if you feel like eating something, walk to the store and eat it right away), maybe take some Vitamin D supplements too/ get out in the sun.   I think the fog is different for everyone. For me, it's like I keep revolving these ideas in my head until they make me feel like someone else, like I'm obsessed about how I'm perceived and creating perfection. It's like being ENFP but in the most negative way possible: turning my creativity inwards, because my creative ideas are incompatible with my personal reality. I'm not saying being disconnected naturally flows into that, but it's a slippery slope."

Sometimes averaged somewhere between a fifth of liquor a week and a pint of liquor a night.   Pain pills to the extent of mild opiate withdrawal. Which wasn't bad, but that compounded with my depression made me intolerable. I told an old man to fuck off outside a convenience store for making small talk with me, at the worst of it. I told everyone to fuck off in various ways. I was a raging asshole, because that buzz was gone and it was the only nice thing in my shitty grind of a life.   Amphetamines to the point that I felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest, and I continued taking them past the point of chest pains and heart palpitations. Around that time I considered cocaine, but I knew if I ever tried it then it would be the death of me.   One thing I'll say about drugs is that all of the cliches are true. You unlearn the ability to cope with pain without shoveling substances into your body. You shut people out and sit in your apartment alone because others are an uncertainty and sometimes a disappointment, and drugs are a guaranteed escape. Develop a drug addiction--even a relatively minor one--for six months and watch how many relationships you sabotage without even realizing it. You wake up sober one day and realize you burned bridges without even realizing it in your stupor.   I don't know if they're worth it, really, in the long term. But when the drug hits you and you feel at peace for that small window of time, it definitely feels like it."

Right now you feel fucked up, maybe you are, and that means that you lived a beautiful story, and that you're aware you made mistakes. But it doesn't matter, everyone make mistakes, everyday, you have to accept it.    Your story with her is over. It's over. Over. It may be hard to listen, and even harder to accept, but it's the facts. Be happy you lived something beautiful, something that meant something for you, be happy it happened, but don't be sad it's over. Everything eventually ends one day, but everything that can happen in the universe doesn't automatically happens. Your story with her happened, it was based on a strong love, and everybody doesn't have the same chance you had with her.    Be proud of your relationship with her, be proud of the man you are now. It's not the end of the world, nor the end of your live, it's just the end of a chapter. But the book is not over, there are more chapters to come, maybe some will hurt like hell, maybe others will make you the happiest man on earth, but the only way to find out is to read the chapters, to write the chapters, because you're not just a reader, you're the writer, the author of your own life, you're the only one that can improve yourself, that can change your life for good, that can make the decisions. Go out, live life, be happy, be sad, laugh, cry, love, be angry, be a human being.    You're going through something important, and eventually you'll be ok again, but it's up to you if it's gonna be in 1 month, 5 months, 1 year, or even more. Be strong, don't judge yourself, it's not your fault, it's not her fault, it just happened this way. You know have more free time to do whatever you want or like. Pick up a hobby, start painting or woodcraft, improve your cooking skills, do exercice, read some books, go on a trip, by yourself or with friends, but do something.    You can move, you can think, you can act, you can choose, you can make something of your life, you're not meant to sit all day on your couch to worry about everything. There is a hole now in your heart, a big, deep painful hole. Take care of it, heal it, fill it. You're not the ""half of a couple"", you're one now, someone complete, and you have to take care of yourself, because nobody will do it for you, or at least it won't be as efficient, not even close to be efficient. It can help for a while, but you have to do the job, you will do the job.    You're not the worst man on earth, you're not particularly worse than anybody in the world. Hitler had a wife. Hitler. A wife. Even one of the most hated person in history found love, how dare you say nobody wants to be with you? Have you met everyone in the world? Have you even met everyone in your own city? In your own neighbourhood? How many people do you know? 100? Maybe 200, if we count the acquaintances you may have. Now, how many people do you meet everyday, in the streets, in the bus, in a bar, without talking to them, without knowing who they are, without even knowing their names? A lot. A LOT. Some day, you'll meet someone for you, her eyes will shine with love for you, and your heart will sound like a Phil Collins' drums solo everytime you'll see her. But it's not gonna happen if you worry about yourself and mourn during months and years.    It became a meme, it's buzzing all around the internets, but once, just once, seriously consider the message he's delivering, because if you apply these advices every single day of your life, you'll be unstoppable: JUST DO IT!.    PS: One last point, it's not really on the same subject, but I wanted to talk about it. I, like a lot of people, strongly believe that you can do and be what you want if you have enough will. BUT, you have to be realistic about one thing: yourself. You can't instantly change to become what you want. And you're limited, you can't do every possible thing in the world. You have to chose, and most of all, you have to know and understand yourself. It's hard to listen, but someone in a wheelchair won't beat Usain Bolt in a race. Never. Because they can't run. But they can win the Paralympics Games in their categorie.     So much of my self-conception has focused on being so magical-fairy-fun     Is that what you are, or what you want to be? Sometimes it's hard to know the answer, but you must be able to know it, because if you don't you'll end up deluding yourself, and nothing good can come from believing you're someone you're in fact don't really are."

I hope it all helps and you find someone that can make your life fairy like again, but time helps a lot."
ENFP,3dmka4,schmalexandra,5,Fri Jul 17 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"Don't worry.  Here is what you need to know right now, as someone who completely identifies with your situation and did the exact same thing three months ago:  people like you even when you are sad. I promise. Yes, you get used to being the ""fun, entertaining"" one. and yes, that is part of why people like you.  But if youre anything like i know an ENFP would be, you're also sensitive, empathetic, insightful, smart, and loyal. The reason people are checking in on you and inviting you to stuff is not really because they have some desperate need for entertainment from yourself right now. It's because you have been there for them, and they are returning the favor. Think of it as you reaping in all the social capital you have acquired when you were yourself and happy.  Reach out. cry. be sad and boring and lumpy. Tell your friends. They don't care! they want to be around you so that you can be fun later. and you will be.  That being said, obviously you and this girl didn't work out because of some fundamental error. Open relationships (or polyamory, look into the real fine details of that because it REALLY helps with open relationships and how they flourish) are completely doable! and really really satifsying when you find the right person to do it with. In my experience, they only work when both people are really on board and know what they are getting into, but they work.  Don't give up. You'll find someone. right now just focus on being alone, being with people who love you, and being yourself. It takes a lot of difficulty to readjust to being alone, but take comfort in knowing that it a completely universal struggle. Breakups suck. period. for everyone.  PM me if you need anything - seriously. I just got out of a major depressive episode because I was in the same thought process as you and I couldn't pull myself out of it. I had to quit my internship and move home for the summer.  Don't worry. take a deep breath. people like you. you can do this. You are an ENFP!! you WILL fall in love again! We are REALLY GOOD at falling in love."

The world looks so shiny for so long and then when we chase shiny and lose something important to us we are filled with instant regret, despair, and self-blame. It's our nature, but it doesn't define us. Don't let it define you. Feel your feelings and know that you are going to take this wonderful experience as a learning experience.  When I went through a similar situation, I went to counseling to work on being a bit more accountable for my actions. That helped me see who I am as a person, but also figure out what I wanted and what was important to me in a relationship. Ultimately, ending the one I was in was really good for me and I have found myself with someone who is more the yin to my yang (an ISTJ- all grounded and logical and who has to catch me in mid-flight toward the clouds on most days.) Use this time to take stock of your life. I read this great article about ""dithering"". We need to take time to do nothing and process what is happening to us and around us. Take some time to ""dither"" and know that you have support from your friends, your loved ones, and strangers on the internet who have been where you are. PM anytime.

And in that sense, I totally understand. . . but! I feel that if there's a person you genuinely feel something for, then. . it's worth the risk :) Most people, later in life, say that they wished they had taken more risks. . so carpe diem, friend! you seem like a cool person, so if one relationship doesn't work out, never worry, this earth is filled with so many potentially great people~ almost half of them being females heh~  In fact, if your crush/interest starts out as your friend, you at least know that FOR SURE that they enjoy your company, and hence WANT to spend more time with you :D So never question your ""worth""~  Hmmm, but I'm the type to ask out who I like first, without any hesitation. . . so maybe spend time with more extroverted chicks?

Then we fell in love, because it was so easy to talk to each other, we got along great, and we loved how well we complement each other. I love his introverted personality, he keeps me grounded.

ENFP,3dl070,lookmaimalawyer,8,Fri Jul 17 03:06:56 2015 UTC,"The best advice I've ever been given on this is this: how you manage your highs also determines how well you manage your lows. That was said to me a little over a year ago. Not an overnight success, but wow, what a difference.  Whether we're feeling on top of the world or at the bottom of everyone else's shoe, what is happening is we are being lead by our hyperactive emotional pilot. And we need to learn to slow ourselves down during both. If we learn to pump the brakes when we are in that unstoppable mode, we can learn to pump the brakes on the negativity too. And it's easier to train this when we're in our superman state.  Let's say I just had a productive day at work, where I did double the amount of anyone else. Autopilot thinking may be ""I'm the best person here, I deserve a promotion."" Or maybe I iust painted a beautiful picture. ""I'm the best artist I know. I'm painting pictures just as good as Van Gogh's ten years earlier than he did.""  We need to recognize these thoughts and not latch onto what they're saying, but what they're indicating. All these really mean are ""I'm happy with how productive I am today"" or ""I really like this painting I made."" We should separate our identity from our accomplishments.  Now here's how it plays in to managing the lows. I have a day at work where I just checked my phone all day and am feeling lousy about myself. ""Man I'm the laziest person around here. I'm so distracted."" Or I paint a picture and don't see any value in it. ""Wow. I'm so uninspired. I must be out of ideas. I'm a crappy artist. It's over for me...""  Once again, we are identifying ourselves by our performance. Instead, the next time we catch ourselves thinking like this automatically, we can train ourselves to realize ""These thoughts just mean I'm not happy about my productivity at work"" or ""I'm not happy with this painting."" It's a lot easier to try again and see ourselves better after those latter statements.  Whether we are in a manic or depressive spell (and I'm not indicating that we are manic-depressives, everyone deals with this in some way), these feelings train us to be led to and believe whatever our automatic thinking tells us. It's a problem all intuitives deal with, I believe. Intuition, whether introverted or extraverted, is a procress of making logical shortcuts that are often accurate. But not always. So it's important to keep ourselves in check this way because we can make mistakes in what we think about ourselves very often."

I've NEVER been the type to play dumb like a lot of my more romantically successful friends, but Im definitely am not an ice queen. I like having deep, meaningful conversations so I can get to know someone and then we can get physical, I just have a hard time letting go when a stranger is touching me. Being turned on is 95% mental/emotional for me. I've always been very compassionate and giving, but I can't seem to warm up to the idea of hookups.

By forcing this on your kids your essentially saying the way that they are is not good enough despite all the other good things they do. As it turns out it was a metabolic disorder that I had no control over anyway. I didn't discover this until after college. So as it stands now, I am partly crab apple, but with patience I know I could open up. I just take longer than most.

ENFP,3di998,Buddhamama42,6,Fri Jul 17 02:57:05 2015 UTC,"I think the problem here is one of guts. I have no trouble talking with girls platonically as well, the challenge is escalating to intimacy. Escalate too slowly and you can be written off as just a friend. You need meaningful one on one moments. I’ll often start by remarking what I really like about them, and then suggesting, “we should grab drinks/coffee sometime, are you free sometime this weekend?”  Then…   First Date: Focus on getting to know one another better, and creating intimate moments. If a significant enough moment was created, try to opt in for a kiss at the end. Otherwise, if you are just starting to get to know the other person, suggest that you both have round two and grab dinner or partake in an activity e.g. hiking, ice cream, movie, basket weaving, whack-a-mole, etc. Second Date: Dinner or activity. Make sure to allow for a few silent moments. They create suspense, and an awkward sense of intimacy. The occasional opportunistic touch is also helpful, as is glancing at their mouth or eyes. Get a kiss at the end. Third Date: Usually the opposite of the second date e.g. if 2nd date was dinner, shoot for an activity. Then, same stuff. Only this time you get to be a bit more honest with your feelings. I like to remark about what I really admire about them, and then suggest we make a habit of hanging out….and making out. Then opt in or out for a night cap if you are bold enough.   And if you are worried about being too friendly, just shut your trap a little bit more during the date. Seriously, being a little more quite, and having the other person talk by asking them meaningful questions will help you stay out of the friend zone and in the intimate zone. And when I say meaningful questions, I mean RISKIER questions. Big questions. Like what is your biggest fear, if you had one year to live what would you do, what did you think of me when we first met, etc.  Edit: Formatting"

ENFP,3di998,insanitune,6,Thu Jul 16 23:29:39 2015 UTC,"As an ENFP woman with a fair amount of dating experience in my salad days, I would say that if all you want is sex, then any of the nasty ""pick up artist"" type maneuvers detailed here will help get a girl into bed. If you want an insecure woman spreading her legs for you because she has daddy issues.  If you actually want a soul melding, earth moving relationship with a woman you love, then you can only be yourself, not present a shallow alpha fascade.  The only advice I can give you, is that if you find yourself friendzoned, move on quickly, don't mope. By all means keep that woman as a friend, but immediately ask someone else out for a date. We ENFPs love being in love and can get stuck idealizing someone who isn't interested.   Also, I keep saying this, dancing lessons !! Salsa or swing are a great way to meet women. Salsa in particular.... Dancing lessons are always full of single women, with a romantic streak (hence dancing lessons). Plus women love a man who can really dance."
ENFP,3di998,Hip-HopHead,3,Fri Jul 17 00:27:07 2015 UTC,I am the best dancer I know. It's the best for meeting people. I agree that the fucking pua shit here is so outputting. That stuff always felt so wrong to me.

ENFP,3di998,Hip-HopHead,11,Thu Jul 16 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"I like to show interest in the beginning of meeting someone, then back off (not initiating contact). I think most ENFPs' enthusiasm is off putting for women, because it shows high availability (low status). Try to not show all your cards in the beginning and get her to wonder about you. Be a little demanding and have standards for her to aspire to.   Poke and prod, be playful, but stop giving her so much attention."
ENFP,3di998,Avalonsnake,5,Thu Jul 16 17:52:02 2015 UTC,That's the problem as an ENFP if i want to get to know someone even because of boredom ill always keep the conversation going. I don't know how to tone down my enthusiasm honestly. I could throw some compliments in there and vibe it out a little then back off though. Also how would enthusiasm show low status?
ENFP,3di998,ColdCircuit,6,Thu Jul 16 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"High status men do not ask for approval. They know what they want and they go get it. High status men have their priorities straightened out and vying for attention is not one of them.   When you talk to a girl too much, you communicate low status (nothing better to do, your life is boring).   Try to be sexual with a woman from the get-go. Do not hesitate to crack sexual jokes or sexual comments that have double meanings. Women like to wonder. They play up your status if you give them limited info on yourself."

ENFP,3di998,ProjectCadence,4,Thu Jul 16 20:22:01 2015 UTC,"Make every interaction count by bringing value to your conversations. Don't just talk for the sake of talking. Speak with intent, conviction, and meaning.   ENFP fools like you and me talk too damn much. We naturally want affirmation from other people. Getting your affirmation from women you are interested in conveys neediness, and talking to a woman often is asking for her affirmation.   Basically, you are putting the girl on a pedestal by talking to her all the time. You are saying, ""I have no life, so I'm going to talk to you all the time in hopes of you liking me. Your opinion matters more to me than anything else in the world."""

If you don't think it's legit then just go the way you've been going about it. It sounds like you've been reeeeeaaaal successful going at it your way.  All sarcasm aside though, maybe try it out and if it doesn't work for you then try another process because sticking with what you have been doing doesn't seem to be working.

That's the key here...now if you weren't talking about that and were asking about starting a genuine relationship I can understand what you just said about the pick up artists and what not. But to be very frank, my interpretation of your post is that you just wanna fuck, if you didn't you would have asked about about how you can start a relationship where the sex will naturally happen.  But....look at the title of your post, ""Male ENFPs, how do you get the girl (bedroom acrobatics)."" You specifically go out of the way to emphasize the sex part. Building off of that... how can you all of a sudden sound like you're above these ""pick up artist's gospel"" or what ever techniques they use to get girls.

ENFP,3dh0ep,blindAlley,10,Thu Jul 16 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"It's really important for ENFP's to tailor their behaviour to their emotional climate. We have the tendency to get lost in our enthusiasm, or we stick to it for the sake of our reputation, but this almost always leads to emotional dissonance. Now emotional dissonance is a complex concept, but let me explain it with an analogy. Imagine all your emotions are little puppies that all want your attention. If you're hugging all op the puppies except one, that puppy is going to act out until you give it some love. If you ignore it long enough, it will eventually become vicious and start scratching and biting at your surface. So keeping all of that in mind, I think you should really practise being sad amongst people. It's a skill that is very hard for ENFP's to develop as it's not in line with a lot of our core values, but it will save you a lot of pain in the long run!

Firstly, as a dude. I felt very constricted by my gender stereotype: men shouldn't cry. And secondly, I hadn't developed any deep emotional bonds with my friends yet because I was too busy looking for my own path. Once that search became less compulsive I found more patience to develop close bonds with people (cause that shit takes time, as all things worth doing do)."

ENFP,3dh0ep,QPILLOWCASE,3,Mon Jul 20 23:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get what you're saying. It shocks people, really. Whoever gave you that sun of their life analogy hit it on the head without realizing it. What if one day instead of the sun rising, the moon just stayed up and night remained and they had to be the one to raise the sun? It's hard for them to comprehend. My intent is not to say they're stupid, but it's really something very foreign.  Now my experience with this has been vaguely similar, in that the friends I have made (save one) have something pretty shitty they have to deal with at home, and they've got some sort of depression and anxiety from it. I've got some kickass parents and a lot to be prideful of and happy about, but I'm just as depressed as they are. In different ways, granted, but in the end both of us are sad. What happens is I feel like I'm not entitled to be as sad as I am because I don't have the same bullshit they do, and sometimes I'm treated like it. Now I'm not friends with that person anymore, but there were times were I felt both dumb and insulted because of having the way I felt be invalidated due to not having as difficult a home as they do.  Of course this means that the people who respond negatively when you approach them with sorrow are either bewildered, confused, or resentful. You probably don't want to keep the resentful people in your life. Everybody is entitled to be sad. It's one of the most basic natural emotions and it happens; just because you've got a little optimism and joy in your heart doesn't mean you can't have a little bit of solemnity too.  Just uh, don't romanticize being sad and depressed and stuff. That shit's not good."

It kinda sucks because it messed with my head for the longest time when I was questioning maybe having depression and I repressed it for almost a year because ""I can't be depressed. I'm supposed to be happy all the time!"" and it kinda sucks to feel pressured to be happy. Most of my friends are really supportive though and reassure me that no human can be happy and in a good mood all the time, so please don't feel like you have to constantly beam sunshine and happiness.

ENFP,3dgrv9,winnay,4,Thu Jul 16 03:43:01 2015 UTC,"I'm exactly the same way!  Sometimes my spouse gets annoyed because I spend so much of our time together focused on helping my friends, but I can't help it. That is the role I play in their lives.  The way that I see it, is that my friends are my family. They have been there to help me move, because they could. They have been there to lend me money, because they could. They have been there to babysit my daughter, because they could. They have been there to support me in every way that they're ""rich"" in.  Now, if my friends needed a large sum of money, I wouldn't be able to give them that, because right now I don't have it. If my friends needed help moving, it would be hit or miss, only because I am a single parent to my beautiful 3 year old. But when my best friend texts me at 11pm when I'm ready to go to sleep, that she's having trouble with her relationship?  I CAN be there in that moment. That is support that I can not only offer, but that I'm really good at.   Yes, sometimes it's a lot more draining then being the friend that can just write a cheque. But I feel that the role I play in the life of my friends brings so much value to their lives, and mine. Because those people that I'm there for, are there for me. I know that I can trust them with all of me, and vice versa.   Relationships, whether romantic, parental, familial, or professional, take a lot of work. They don't just magically happen, it's a choice that we're make in every moment. Everyone wants their friends to be there for them but people often don't stop to consider that they themselves need to be that person too. It's reciprocal.

ENFP,3dgrv9,Tangential_Diversion,3,Thu Jul 16 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"For me, it heavily depends on the situation.  If it's a friend going through a rough time in their life and needs someone to bitch to, I'm all ears. Give me a call and I'll be over with some beer, pizza, and movies. Even the best of people have rough periods. Breakups, shitty people, deaths, or even ""I teach kids and after the Minions movie I've been listening to kids doing Minion voices all. fucking. day."" Sorry, that last one may have been mine.  If it's someone who repeatedly has the same issues, complains all the time, and does nothing about them, it gets tiring very quickly. One example that comes to mind is one person I met who repeatedly complained about how they're broke, jobless, have bad luck dating, etc., then would go out of their way to make all the wrong decisions. If you're broke and unemployed, take literally any job. Take a retail or service job. $8/hr is more than $0/hr, and you have real bills to pay. Instead, volunteering in a field completely unrelated to what you work in and what you want to do is stupid when you can't make rent. Similarly, everyone has dating issues, but it's stupid to complain when you ask for advice on if you should pursue a long distance guy who admits to being emotionally unstable with commitment issues, then go for him anyways.  So yea, for me it definitely depends. If it's the former, I'm all ears because everyone needs some support once in a while. If it's the latter, I drop the person. I'm not a free therapist, and at a certain point you just have to grow up and get your shit together, you know?"

I have one friend though who has severe bipolar issues. She refuse to get help medically and mentally yet she tries to treat me like her therapist and doesn't bother to listen to what I saw.

Because after I go I'm not coming back again."" It does beg the question of why, if I know I can't come back to him again, I can't just leave him now.  It's so hard. We all know what the right thing to do is, but our heads aren't aligned with our hearts. It's taken me 3 months to get to this point. I feel numb because I've taken to numbing my feelings about him, but also I'm so sad and hurt that it didn't work out in the end. If it has to end I suppose it has to end.

It is extremely hard to change others, so never hold that expectation. The second is that our if-only's are based on our own perceptions. Sometimes we are just trying to make someone into something we like. We might think we are clear minded but really we aren't either.  Wounds will always heal. It just takes time.

Maybe a couple of days, then I get bored and lonely again haha. If something has actually happened to annoy me/hurt me then it's usually a couple of weeks.   I really like this time though, I use it to reflect and pick through my thoughts. Start to untagle the cluttered mess they have become! It makes me feel fresh and like I can function properly again haha :)   I wonder why it is that you really don't enjoy this time, yet you feel like you need it. Does the withdrawal happen intentionally or do you just kinda find it happening? Sorry if I'm being invasive, I'm just generally curious!"
ENFP,3dgqps,_bonafide,2,Thu Jul 16 13:14:56 2015 UTC,"I think the reason I don't like the alone time so much is that I love interacting with people because I know I have the power to brighten up other people's day. Now when I'm more normal extroverted self, this is definitely the case.  On the other hand, during my phases of withdrawal I feel like I'm doing the opposite. I feel as though by showing my depression to others it is causing depression/sadness in them, on a level that I don't believe most people aren't aware of. It's seems as though my emotions/vibes that I give off trigger a mirrored response in the brain's of others, and people unconsciously copy the emotions/vibes a gibe off with my body and mind into their own life.   And speaking of awareness, I am also aware that what I'm describing sounds extremely narcissistic, to suggest that I have such a profound on people, but believe me when I say I do not intend it that way."

Your friends are human too, they probably know that everyone has their off days. I doubt it's going to affect them that much, I mean sure it may not be as crazy fun as usual, but isn't that just life? The good with the bad and all that? haha Could you just talk to them on those anti social days? Tell them how you're feeling and work with that? You know, like doing something more low key so there's not as much pressure? Or maybe just take a day or two off for yourself, then go back when you're feeling ready?  I mean I know we're naturally extroverted, but we need time to ourselves as well to rest and recharge and all that :) Don't burn yourself out!"
ENFP,3dgqps,happyfacetimes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:57:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It's frustrating as all hell because I'll want to be social and just can't - it's like my mind will blank in situations where I'm generally (and preferably) a lot more talkative. It can last from a few days up to a month for me (or longer I suppose, but for me that probably indicates I'm actually suffering from depression, which is a different thing).   Usually it happens after periods where I get in my own head too much, worrying about work/study/relationships. To my knowledge, there are only 3 fixes: 1. Time 2. Doing something that really requires you to be in the moment - I've been helping look after my 6 month old nephew recently and that works for me 3. Addressing the original issues  I guess there is a 4th in some recreational drugs (mdma, which in some ways is the perfect drug for our type) but I don't like to think of it in that way so it doesn't become a coping mechanism for those down times.  I'd be curious if other ENFP's struggles ""staying in the moment"", actually - I never quite know what to do to get out of it other than the above, but when I do get out of that funk it can happen very quickly. I am like you in that even when I'm going through my down/introverted periods it's not because I want to be, but because I sort of forget how to stop thinking/obsessing and just ""be"". I'm probably on the middle to lower end of the extroversion scale (and am a male ENFP who's grown up in a very masculine culture) so it could just be me being a little repressed, too."
ENFP,3dgqps,Earthbounded,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"This happens to me for a day or so every few weeks. Something discouraging happens to me and I kind of start getting into the whole ""no one actually likes me, I have no true friends"" mood for a few hours. I snap out of it pretty quickly though, as soon as I see something optimistic, or sometimes I'll just be laying there and randomly get energized and optimistic again. It's weird.  And generally, I do have ""off"" days where I want to go and socialize, but when I do I just feel awkward and I'm not as active as I usually am."

I realise that in your relationship, in my case, I get a little bored because everything is perfect and I feel wanted.  So i try to talk to others to get that energy again, and I'm not expecting anything sexual. Difficulty is with ENFP's is that we only have sex with people we have an emotional connection with, the problem is we have an emotional connection with everyone.  Don't let that energy take over you man, because think if the roles were reversed for your partner, I'm pretty sure you'd feel like shit as I would."

Plus I had an overly flirty nature, I think I just liked people better that way haha it's just fun!   buuuuut I've grown up a lot since then, I realised how it hurts other people.

I love the challenge of remembering and juggling schedules in my head, just not when it's MY classes and appointments and stuff. But I digress.  My flakiness is usually due to the fact that I'm really bad at predicting people and situations and how I'm going to feel, and so I assume the worst, panic, lose motivation, self sabotage on occasion, and then cancel with people, including people I actually adore. I find I'm really good at backwards analysing, like figuring out why something happened or people's motives, and get by on intuition in the present to tell me how people are feeling and what they need, but when it comes to the future and guessing how people will react I'm unable to judge, even based off of past experience.

ENFP,3da4d7,pithyplatypus,10,Tue Jul 14 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"That's smart.  Caution is smart.  Drugs are only one of many ways to alter the mind.    Psychedelics are amazing tools for consciousness exploration and mindspace travel, but they can also be distractions and diversions from life.  I love LSD and mushrooms.  LOVE THEM.  But I find it easy to get stuck reliving trips and getting nostalgic for my first trips, and using them as escapism instead of taking my experiences forward and being present.  Everything I ""learned"" on psychs, I was simply shown - I already knew.    MDMA is mindblowing and revelatory for persons with autism, or PTSD, or who struggle with empathy and self-awareness - as a relatively uncomplicated ENFP I find it's too much, too many feelings, too vulnerable to be comfortable.    Coke is not that great unless you love feeling like an egomaniac."
ENFP,3da4d7,mocchan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"Everything I ""learned"" on psychs, I was simply shown - I already knew.   Interested in this! Do you think you would have eventually been made aware that you knew those things if you hadn't become aware of them in that way? Do you think it would have had the same impact on your life/style of thinking or more? Or less?  With your too-vulnerable-to-be-comfortable experiences with MDMA, were you with people or alone?"
ENFP,3da4d7,mocchan,2,Tue Jul 14 20:02:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't experiment much until my mid-late twenties.  It's impossible to pinpoint but I was already quite self-aware and I don't feel like a different person on the other side of the trip.  I like to think psychedelics mainly helped me mellow out, be kinder, and stop sweating the small stuff. With people, at events.  Every bad experience came from accidentally meeting mean or troubled strangers."
ENFP,3da4d7,SlightlyWorrying,5,Tue Jul 14 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"I live and study in Amsterdam and drugs are a big part of the culture here. Everyone I know has at least tried weed and usually more. Especially MDMA and XTC are common, but there's a lot out there. Heard a lot about 2CB for example, but I personally haven't dared psychedelics yet. I'm a bit worried that they might trigger the anxieties that I can usually cover up with that classic ENFP enthusiasm. M, X, and coke really amplify my inner ENFP though, much better combination in my opinion. The life changing thing about X for me was that I noticed that people started to understand me more. I've always had to suppress parts of my personality because people didn't understand my enthusiasm for seemingly simple things. I've always had that, even without drugs, and now other people felt it too. So it helped me indirectly. Apart from that I just love the intensity of the feeling. Weed though for example helped me directly: it helped me develop a more docile, mellow personality. It helped me find a balance I guess. When you experience something on drugs you always take it with you in the rest of your life, so you can really learn from the experience. So I guess I incorporated part of the stoned vibe into my everyday personality. So yea, just helped me find balance I guess. And personally I've noticed I'm not prone to addiction at all, because all drugs have clear downsides for me. Weed makes me completely passive, XTC amplifies my personality into absurd proportions, and coke makes me simply insufferable hahaha. So yea, I've learned a lot fr the experiences, but haven't touched anything except for the occasional joint in two years.  Won't ever try meth or heroine though, simply because they are apparently simply too nice. How much would it suck to realise that loving sober is just inferior to living high? Damn...   On mobile btw, so sorry if this is a bit chaotic. Hate having to structure text on mobile...:P"
ENFP,3da4d7,shaverb,2,Tue Jul 14 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"Hahaha your descriptions of MDMA and coke are almost exactly how I would describe them! :P I love them but I can get a bit irritating to some of my close friends.  I also feel similar about meth but, that's because I have done it. Only 3 times over 4 or so years and that's just enough to know I love it too much to do it.  Never fucked around with any opiates because MJ does a fine enough job chilling me out."
ENFP,3da4d7,SlightlyWorrying,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's interesting, I find that I'm at my most anxious, and consequently least cool, with marijuana. Occasionally, very very occasionally, it just makes me more aware of my thought processes without making me more aware of absolutely everything that could be or go wrong in a situation. But those occasions are rare enough that I pretty much never smoke anymore.   It's interesting to me that other people doing allowed them to understand you more, rather than you doing a drug allowing you to understand others or yourself better. I've never done any of the things you listed, and I shy away from them because they seem so... out of control, I guess? I don't like the idea of not being able to rein myself in at all, already being a kind of impulsive and wild person in social settings.   I really, really encourage you to try at least one psychedelic! There are definitely mild and controllable doses, and I found that it didn't interact with or affect my anxiety at all, except to perhaps help me understand its origin (possible only exception being the comedown process of mescaline). If you enjoy creative thinking and self-awareness, it really is an incredible experience to have. Thanks so much for sharing!"

It wasn't working, wasn't working and then I saw myself being sucked into a tunnel. For four hours, I had a complete break with reality. It was by far the scariest and most unexpected experience of my life. My Ikea quilt came alive and tried to eat me! I didn't touch the stuff for years after, until i was past 30. Now, I smoke occasionally, and it just makes me kind of relaxed and dulls my physical pain. No munchies or laughing at stupid stuff. I don't know what happened that first time. I'm 100% sure there wasn't anything else in it besides cannabis, but damn. I don't know anyone else's brain who thinks weed and LSD are the same. These days, I'd pay a premium for that experience again."

It took me a little while to justify it as ok and that I wasn't embarrassed with myself. I had the same internal struggle after trying acid before I graduated, Even though it was a total dud tab and didn't do much at all. With salvia I have had some pretty interesting trips inside my mind that contributed to some of my perceptions about the world; surprisingly no issues with my self image there. Back when I was a heavy Loud user I definitely felt at my coolest and emotionally stable. I did struggle with pent up anger specifically when I would visit home, and still do now that I moved back and have been clean on the job hunt. The best times I find are always with good friends and sometimes I feel like I mess up first impressions if I'm Loud before I make an introduction as opposed to smoking with the person afterwards."

ENFP,3da4d7,Swuell,2,Wed Jul 15 05:28:23 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty wide range of experiences with a lot of different substances.  Mary Jane: My first drug. Tried it around 16 but I didn't like to use it much during school weeks as I was already terrible with memory and obviously MJ didn't help. Once out of HS and in college I became a daily user (still am) but it made me very isolated.   I still use MJ daily but now it's mostly because it keeps me from thinking about how depressing the world is. If I don't smoke it nothing crazy happens, I'm just much more emotional and feel too much for things that are out of my control.  LSD: First experience with acid was definitely different than many following. It was the perfect setting. Rural America with beautiful scenery, woods, and following fish up a stream. It was the first time I experienced a ""hard"" drug and obviously one of the most fantastic and mind expanding times in my life.  It was probably 2-3 years until my next experience and I'll keep that in a separate category as it was used with MDMA and I consider that different than just a single drug.  I've done LSD few times without MDMA but they've all been great. Positive feelings mixed with beautiful visuals but, nothing life changing like the first time.  Candy flipping: The. Shit.  I was going through my first really strong emotional time in my life. Issues with distancing myself, etc. And a friend convinced me to come out to see a jam show with him and friends. Reluctantly I did and that's probably one of the best decisions of my life.  It completely changed how I thought about other people. I previously had a lot of hatred for people who weren't like me and would judge people very harshly (to myself). This made empathy explode in me for the first time. It's impossible for me to go into all the details. Suffice to say, candy flipping changed my life the most intensely positive way. I did this for a good many weekends on end until it lost its sparkle.  I used these drugs in combination to the extent they could have helped me then stopped. No issues lingering issues. No problems with them. Just finished that chapter.  MDMA: Lots. of. rolling. Went to many raves, jam shows, festivals. You know the drill. It makes everyone love everyone which is how I want the world to be all the time. Sadly, it's not reality. I used MDMA ~2-3-4 times a month for probably 2 years. Give or take a few doses a month. Never heavy ass doses, just enough.  I don't use it a bunch anymore because I get extremely emotional a few days after. Again, no lingering issues I know of. Just don't like feeling bad for not seeing and petting my cat for 14 hours :P  Mushrooms: Here and there I will nibble a cap or two. I really like how a small dose makes colors bright and sound amazing. I make tea for my friends a bunch but don't do it a lot personally. Again, I have a tendency to get emotional a day or so after.  COCAINE: I didn't use cocaine until about a year ago. Thank fuck. I generally have good control over my drug use so I can hold onto a bag of anything until I need/want it. But DAMN is coke great. No big emotional hang over, doesn't last all hours into the night, you can sleep easy afterwards. Fabulous. Just expensive as all hell.   My advice is do everything else before you do cocaine. It kind of encompasses a lot of other feelings in one drugs without some of the ""negative"" effects. There's nothing inherently wrong with the drug if you can control yourself and you know your supplier.  Amphetamines: Love me some Adderall. Love me some tweak. Never more than twice a year for the second one though. Shit is dangerously wonderful. You want to feel like a god? That's what'll do it.  Research chems: Fuck em. All of em. Real drugs are out there and available and if they aren't available these aren't worth your time.  I don't know if I could rate any drug more or less useful or better but, I can say that MDMA and LSD changed my life in greatly positive ways."
ENFP,3da4d7,TheVillain117,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"Just on a note--though real great advice for this particular--LSD is the godfather of research chems, its just more finely tuned now and depending on who you get it from, it is less spliced (at least it should be if not think twice) or more.  Dmt and mushrooms though are the genuine with MJ as a lesser one, oh there's also the toad and ayahuasca. Those are definitely worth trying but be prepared.  @OP definitely would recommend dmt, mushrooms and also ayahuasca and the toad (if you can get your hands on these). As these are more of an insight trip then anything.  You'll find something there.  Edit: there's also the other end of the intense spectrum and its salvia, depending on your usage and situation I wouldn't really recommend it but some people swear by it so who knows."

DMT is seriously indescribably ultra-redonkulous, there can never be any words for it.  If someone told me they'd been raving on Ecstasy with aliens in their UFO, and then skydived out from there while simultaneously having sex with 11/10 supermodels, I wouldn't even need to be skeptical of their story - I'd know that I have experienced more awesome, fantastic and crazier things than that by a considerable distance.

This is probably the hardest one to write in a way that says what I want it to but here goes. Like many ENFP's I get on with kids easily & as such enjoy playing stupid games & running around, however as a guy this is always a very fine edge to walk & I'm absolutely paranoid about being labelled something that I'm not. This one may be a little more just me but even though I'm very much an ENFP I love economics, politics, business modelling, sciences, etc... this may be common to many male ENFP's like myself but as yet I haven't seen a lot of this. also being an economically & statistically interested ENFP leads me to some really different opinions that pretty much most other people who love this kind of stuff & no I'm not socialist leaning or Libertarian by any stretch.

I get such a buzz from helping people and perhaps strangely, it's a bigger buzz when i get nothing out of it except the buzz (as long as I don't feel obligated). I get on well with kids and play games and puzzles but due to recent media and news, I'm worried that being friendly could ruin my life. And being asked if I'm gay or bi is annoying but worse is when they simply assume it. I don't (as far as I'm aware) behave or speak in a camp way. I don't flirt with guys and I don't dream about them but I have on several occasions been asked and it gets tedious. I have to forgive the person immediately and usually no harm is intended or done but in some places around the world, if you are not the hardest cunt in the room, then you must be gay. I get real tired of that shit.   I generally share your love of knowing how everything fits together, whether it be science or business but personally I'm more drawn to creative endeavours.   I don't feel more feminine than other men. Mostly because I am not other men. I wouldn't say I'm Macho by any stretch, however, I'm not submissive. I see it more as perceptive and considerate.

ENFP,3d7nhc,Swuell,3,Tue Jul 14 14:27:14 2015 UTC,"It's not so bad. There are parts of my personality that are more feminine and there are parts of my personality that are more masculine. I stopped caring about which I fall into a long time ago. When you're secure in who you are, you stop giving a crap about societal norms.  Some of the things I say/think/do/feel can be feminine sometimes, but eh fuck it. I have a good life with amazing friends and I do okay in the dating world (although 2/3 of my exes are seriously unstable, but that's another thing entirely). So for me, there's nothing to hold back and nothing to be ashamed of. My life is fucking awesome."
ENFP,3d7nhc,Elguybrush,4,Tue Jul 14 21:25:37 2015 UTC,I have definitely noticed that my openness and empathy tend to attract the attention of less emotionally stable people to the extent that most people I have been or are friends with tend to have some emotional or psychological issues to varying extent. And ita not like I go around seeking out these people either. Have you experienced this phenomenon as well?
ENFP,3d7nhc,Avalonsnake,2,Tue Jul 14 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"Have you experienced this phenomenon as well?   Yep! I just happen to attract those people. Not entirely sure why, but I do."

ENFP,3d7nhc,Avalonsnake,3,Wed Jul 15 00:08:21 2015 UTC,"To chime in with a slightly different response. I have found that the less I talk, the smarter people perceive me to be. As I have aged into my late 20s, I've gotten a lot quieter than I used to be and often will let other people do the talking for me. I don't participate in a lot of debates or discussions anymore either (in real life or online).  My Mom was surprised when I explained to her how deeply ENFPs feel emotions. I was actually caught off guard by that. But I often won't talk about what I'm feeling these days and instead save it for when I'm by myself and can blow off steam doing something like listen to music or pour over youtube / reddit for a few hours.  I guess, when I think about it, I've started leaning more towards the INFP side of things. It's helped me to cope as a male ENFP -- especially since I have an ISTJ father and ENTJ brother. They live on a different planet from me -- one void of the emotional sensitivity that I am so tuned into.  But I will echo much of what others have said here. I get along with women really well compared to other men that I know (aside from my INFP buddy who runs laps around me when it comes to female friends). I also do tend to like more feminine things.  But I'm as straight as they come and have a wife and two beautiful children.  The toughest thing for me, really, is the inherent flakiness that comes with having new ideas every 14 seconds. It makes it REALLY hard to work up the stamina to hold down a job and get my important tasks done for the day. But I make it happen. I've seen what life is like when I am not consistent -- and I don't want to go back there."

One simple thing I've change has helped me be more expressive I try to work the phrase ""I feel"" instead of  ""I think"" into my conversations.  example:  I feel great that you asked us this question.   instead of   I think it's great that you asked this question."
ENFP,3d7nhc,Frankenstooge,0,Wed Jul 15 14:43:20 2015 UTC,"I do that too! I have a degree in psychology and part of my coursework talked about using ""feel"" instead of ""think"" as people respond much more positively and feel more engaged by ""feel"" questions. After I started incorporating ""feel"" more into my vocabulary I definitely noticed that conflict centered around people feeling I was analyzing their situations and/or coming across as having an attitude of superiority went way way down.

ENFP,3d7nhc,Frankenstooge,2,Tue Jul 14 12:59:27 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a problem with masculinity or lack of it. I fit in just fine with the guys, and I don't really hide my sensitivity. But I do communicate differently depending on which gender i'm talking to.   And no girl has ever thought I was gay. So I guess I'm just a lot luckier than the other guys out there? I also used to have a huge problem, when I was younger, with every girl thinking I'm flirting with them. I've tried to become more conscious of how I treat girls as to not lead them on despite me genuinely just wanting to be nice."
ENFP,3d7nhc,abemax5,2,Tue Jul 14 14:54:12 2015 UTC,The flirting thing has come up quite a few times in the comments so it seems like that is a really common experience.

ENFP,3d7nhc,xXProLegitXx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:22:47 2015 UTC,"I think the flirty problem is just a result of us ENFP guys trying to be loving.

But then they might just think I'm really flirty T-T  What a gamble.  Weird, I don't think I've ever been accused of being flirty for having deep conversations lol. Hopefully it's not the norm for you."
ENFP,3d741j,FloFromProgressive,2,Tue Jul 14 01:11:14 2015 UTC,The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson is one of my favourites that I would recommend to anybody with our personality type.    It's the story of a guy who escapes his nursing home on his 100th birthday and the silly adventures that follow as well as mixing in flashbacks about the main character's life up until the story begins and all the people he's met along the way.  It's about 400 pages long so not a huge read. The style is definitely comedic and sometimes downright unbelievable but that's what I found especially charming. It's also very easy to read and doesn't use complicated techniques like some authors do.  If you do decide to try it though avoid spoilers! Part of what makes it fun is not knowing what will happen next.

I read it on my kindle when I used to catch the bus to work so I managed to make it last longer that way but if I was reading it for fun it's definitely one of those books I probably would have finished in one setting.
ENFP,3d741j,kirball,2,Tue Jul 14 22:44:57 2015 UTC,Dune by Frank Herbert.  Not Brian Herbert bleh
ENFP,3d741j,beerswithbears,2,Tue Jul 14 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"Everybody stop what you are doing, you only need one author. Neil Gaimain  Beautiful prose, amazing worlds, and meaningful stories that leave you feeling fulfilled when you put the book down. He makes reading feel like an enjoyable exercise in becoming a better person. I'd start with Anansi Boys or Neverwhere. But my favorite is The Ocean at the End of the Lane. The Sandman comics are also fantastical.  Also Terry Pratchett because he's the bomb. FYI - They co-authored a book called Good Omens. BUY THAT SHIT!"

ENFP,3d741j,RatchetyClank,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend The Sacredness of Questioning Everything by David Dark. I think he is almost certainly an ENFP or ENTP. It's mostly about open-mindedness, American culture, religion the beauty of people, etc. I think it's technically written as a Christian devotional but I still enjoyed it very much as an agnostic. I guess if you're not interested at all in religion, it might be a little frustrating to read. A few others that I've felt drew on my personality type specifically are The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Book of Love by Rumi, The Elegance of the Hedgehog, and How to Read a Poem. And, of course, Gifts Differing by Myers and Briggs, if you haven't already read/researched MBTI. It's a fascinating and fairly simple read, though it should be supplemented by more recent resources if you're trying to get a full knowledge of the system. Hope this helps!"

There's ones from PDK (Phillip P Dick) to Stephen King to Anne Rice and some actually good Christian based (since the author is Christian) books -- Dekker -- like Thr33; even though it's labeled Christian I wouldn't really label it as that aside from the general religious reference though alot of books make religious references too so don't hold this author off. His circle trilogy is also brilliant -- you can rearrange the order and it will fit -- while also becoming a pretty good seller as a comic book!  Also /u/wenttoofar already covered some really good ones too; especially that Dorian Gray Haha. The Giver is also a good one and finally becoming a movie.  Edit: there's also Gravity's Rainbow and The Road.

That should definitely clear you up for more versatile work if you really need it; spanning from structured to creative freedom!  Edit: to note I don't think what I put exactly exists (at least as one major) but you don't really need a degree for art (depending on what you are doing) so focus more on one or a combination of the two and than license yourself toward that market! Since the market is coming anyways and there's tons of jobs that don't exist on paper nor have an official title.

ENFP,3d3kuo,katiedid05,7,Mon Jul 13 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"The rules need to make sense. For example, I always turn off the computer monitors in the back office of the gas station I work at because it helps marginally reduce operating costs and because it's better for the environment. I pretty much ignore the giant note demanding that the computer monitors remain on; nobody uses these things for hours, so leaving them on is just an unnecessary waste of energy and money. I mean, according to my calculations, I'm only saving about a nickel a month, but that's still a nickel we could use for other things.   However, I am completely willing to follow rules if they make sense. I follow the speed limit when I'm driving because doing so is typically more efficient than speeding and because going at that speed is significantly safer than speeding. For example, let's say that I'm going 50 mph in a 55 mph zone and a deer jumps onto the road. If I was going 50 mph instead of, say, 60 mph, I'd have slightly more time to react.

I am usually fairly confident that even if I can't change their opinion, I can appeal to them emotionally enough for them to at least consider changing the decision. I'm good at explaining my side of the story, which helps.  A great example of this is the last person that said that they were attracted to me but didn't think dating me would be a good idea. I laughed and said I was persistent and used to getting what I wanted and 8 months later I had won them over.  ...we later got engaged and recently broke up, however, so maybe he was right...but that's another story."

I like being the introvert's confidante. But this is more of a social energy thing rather than a romantic energy, and the only serious relationship I've ever been in was with an equally extroverted guy. I like drawing people out, but in the inevitable times of high stress or of low energy, I don't want to have to worry about navigating my words precisely in order to just get someone to tell me what they feel or mean. Both of my closest friendships are ISxx's with depressive tendencies, so I know from experience that when I can tell something is wrong with someone but they don't express what it is or why, I feel sad, left out, and even annoying. I know it's irrational, and I try not to act on the emotion, but I can't help that I feel it and would rather not choose a relationship where that is a consistent occurrence."

I mean, your relationship has to be more than physical, right?  I suggest trying to pull her into a deeper discussion a few times. See how well she tags along.

Most ENFP women aren't going to be into an ENFP guy, because they're looking for someone to ground them. I don't want to be grounded. I want someone who'll cut loose with me. I wanna get stuck in an eternal feedback loop where we feed our energy into each other and just keep climbing. Don't tell me it'll end when we crash and burn.

I often feel like I'm all like ""Do you think feminism, consumerism, and lack of war makes men feel disempowered?"" and he's all ""Do you wanna see how this engine works?"" That being said, I've found him to be really accommodating of my emotional-ness, and very sweet and caring. I often feel, however, that his tolerance for me emotionally over-reacting comes from a place of ""I don't understand what's going on but it's clearly important to her so I'll just move on"" rather than ""I understand why you're upset, and so will accept that you are upset and move on"", which for some reason bothers me a little.

The other two guys were both incredibly intelligent (one is getting a PhD in nuclear engineering, and the other is an internal med doc), but many people don't assume it at first glance. It's because most of the the time they're distant and hard to get to know, until they let loose and then this goofball partier side comes out.   There isn't much that the ISTPs I've known have been willing to publicly share, except for a fierce competitive spirit. Beyond that, they're better activity friends than long talks friends. The doc one and I were good friends in med school, and it was him I went to to set up a study bet for our first board exam. Basically money for every undistracted hours of studying the other person did. I knew that he'd hold me to it, but still had his own agenda with maintaining a work life balance. It was the best 20 dollars I ever spent. But even though we sat next to each other every day, even though he was right there to help me move when I was in a bad situation, we never hung out much outside of class. It's not really his thing.   Would I date either of those guys? No, I don't really see it happening. Because at the end of the day, while I respect who they are and find them damn solid people, we don't actually understand or know each other on an intimate level. Or at least, I don't completely get them, and they've never really said anything that confirms they understand me or have really attempted to ask the questions needed to look under my surface. Because they don't say much. It's the communication. They share with who they want, and anyone outside of that super close inner circle isn't really in it at all.   Heh, besides, the doc one has some pretty rigid thoughts about gender roles and has found himself in repeated flabbergasting with me 'thinking like a man'. LOL.  Anyway, if you want success with your ENFP, show him who you are, through words and actions. More words than you think are necessary. We need that communication to feel connected."

Conversely, it is suggestive of things ENFPs do that aren't as obvious. For example, Si's need to be comfortable and secure does come up when we're stressed (thus having to resort to lower functions). It's the constant nagging that tells us we should worry about our well-being and having a secure future. It's the muscle pain that comes from sleeping unsoundly nearly all the time. It's why meditation helps boost our vigor so vibrantly.

ENFP,3cye2y,Dejay79,3,Sun Jul 12 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it does take me a long time to get adjusted to routines although I benefit from them greatly when I make them efficient, or somehow meaningful to my own identity. Basically, I have to infuse them with Te or Fi, otherwise I'm very suspect. I refuse to do something simply because ""that's the way it's always been done"". Societal rules and tradition on their own are very much bullshit to me until I can see the inner workings and know my own why.   Of course, being in the ""grip"" I become highly meticulous, this perfectionism comes out of nowhere, and a I can be a class A work a holic. I just keep on pulling responsibility on myself because I know I can get it done. But once again, it's never alone, it's always mixed with some Fi and Te. Like, take for example my last two weeks at my new job (I'm an psychiatrist intern/resident). I'm really new to this, and I have all these patients to care for. I'm highly protective of them, and I find myself double checking everything even though they've been cleared medically by the ED. Because I get afraid that they've labeled them as ""psych patients"" and just pushed them through.   And I know that the ED's job is life or death situations, not all the little bitty stuff that builds up when you're too mentally ill to care for yourself. So it's necessary to pull out my own fine tooth comb when I medically clear them myself. But until I develop my own protocols and routes of doing this...I am slow. Struggling to put those in place until I have really learned things inside and out is probably a product of less ultilized Si.  But it's ok, because I will grind, grind, grind until the work is completed. Throw some Fi and Si together and I am down right duty bound by my honor until the job is done. When I'm using Te and Si together, I am a very blunt reality check.   I think Si is my intensely serious side, while Ne is my joy and banter.

I don't actively enjoy routines but I understand that they are useful, productive, and stabilizing, and since I've always been pretty aware of my tendency towards unreliability, I value and pursue them. So, not enjoyable, but also not unenjoyable.   However, structure for the sake of structure, rules for the sake of rules, codes of conduct, propriety, and the like set my fucking teeth on edge. I swear to God it's an utterly visceral reaction of disgust and an almost irresistible urge to exit. I have a good friend who is ISFJ and loves rules and regulations with all her heart, which has been really eye-opening, but it's still a pretty inveterate reaction for me.  Furthermore, I have a terrible eye for sensory detail and just a terrible memory in general for isolated facts. If I understand how lots of data works together, I can retain some specifics within the overarching concept to an extent, but random numbers, events, what I had for dinner last night, or trivia? Not a damn chance.   I've always felt a little stupid for this in the face of those who seem to sponge up facts, and I also really admire/envy the Si-primary's ability to be thoughtful about, aware, and receptive of his environment. I tend to lose stuff quickly and easily and accidentally break just about everything that's important to own.

That is to say, I'll often feel very strongly compelled to act in a certain way, and I won't be able to put my finger on exactly why, and it is often in contradiction with my usual values.  For example, ENFPs in general (and I'm no exception, generally) aren't really ones for material possessions, but I often find myself drawn to high quality items such as watches and clothes in classic styles. Over time I've come to realise this as inferior Si. As well as this, I sometimes feel a strong  pull towards traditional dress codes, etc... which sounds crazy for an ENFP.  Simpler examples of inferior Si is always agreeing to stay over at a friend's, and always forgetting that you hate sleeping anywhere but your own bed, or always ordering the same thing at a restaurant despite quite wanting to experiment."

I can think of three reasons why he brought his friends: 1. He somehow lost interest prior to the date and brought friends to save himself from feeling too awkward. 2. He wanted to see how well you would fit in with his friends. 3. He feels that 'the more the merrier' and it didn't occur to him that not everyone feels the same way.   I think that option 3 is the most likely, and he thought you would bond quickly and find it as much fun as he did. Understandably you didn't, and as a result he probably wasn't impressed by how you didn't immediately fit in with the crowd.  Unfair on his part, but a possible headache avoided on your end. He sounds like a person who isn't all that considerate of people with a different personality from his own and it would take some work to make this not an issue in any relationship that followed.   As an ENFP myself I enjoy bringing my partner to events with my friends and have all the people I care about together, but a first date is not the time for this."

It's good that you took this step and although it may feel intimidating to put yourself out there, a date is a good way to get an impression of a person and see how well you fit together.  It's natural that you're nervous but don't raise the stakes too high for yourself! You're not there to impress, it's a two way compatibility test. What happened the other night is definitely not the standard fare and I assure you that it doesn't have to be that way - dates can be a lot of fun and it's often best to approach them in a ""fun night out and anything else is a bonus"" manner. :)   I was actually in a similar situation once where a blind date brought a roommate.

I agree with the three options Foyada laid out but I disagree with the one that it most likely was. Seeing as how it was a first date, something he was well aware of, I doubt that it just did not occure to him not to bring his friends.  I get the sense that he 'changed' the plans because he got nervous for some reason, that reason could well have been #1. He lost interest prior to the date but not enough to completely call it off.  Either way I think we all agree you'll be better off without him.  Now as far as dating ENFP's goes I would strongly suggest giving us another chance, sure we have out bad apples just like any type, But I feel confident that the Good ENFP males far out weigh the bad AND that we are a very awesome type to date... as long as you can compliment us frequently ;)"

They don't open up to their crazy, creative, enthusiastic inner world until they fully trust you. This makes the INFJ seem like a boring, lifeless introvert at the beginning of a relationship. They always seem to be on the defensive, never giving too much information, always conscious on how they present themselves.  ENFPs tend to have the attention span of a squirrel- especially when what they see does not excite them.   If you really want to give this guy a chance, I suggest you show a little of that energetic side of you. Don't be afraid to show your true self! ENFPs won't judge you for your weirdness. :D"

ENFP,3cw0h5,Avalonsnake,3,Sat Jul 11 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that it's his job to make you comfortable enough to show that part of yourself. If you aren't comfortable opening up, then that's too bad (for him). There are plenty of other ENFPs who are willing to put in the effort to get to know you! Don't blame yourself too much, it's just how you are. :)   I always loved picking away at INFJs walls little by little. I know there's a fun-loving side lurking deep below the surface, just waiting for the right opportunity to show.   Don't get too caught up with this one thing. I know you might be really lonely ('cause no one understands you), but there are always better opportunities on the horizon. If he doesn't like you, then it's his loss. Move on and keep your chin up!"

He very, very begrudgingly complied, but when we got back home and had a few drinks, he completely unloaded on me about how desperate and needy and pathetic I was and how he couldn't stand me. And he was right. I really had made him the center of my world because I didn't know how to cope with my dad's illness. I still have the scars on my arm from that night from when I took his cigarette out of his mouth and burned myself, hoping he'd stop me. He was certainly right, but god damn, it was soul crushing. We stayed together til New Year's, too.   ""You've taught me how to believe in myself"" - a friend who didn't know me back in the days with my ex boyfriend.

ENFP,3cu14i,justanotherjobseeker,7,Fri Jul 10 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"I have almost the exact same story...  I graduated valedictorian from my high school and ended up going to an Ivy league with nothing but passion, upbeat enthusiasm about all there is to learn, and just general optimism about life and the universe. College was unfortunately just one big downhill slide in terms of motivation and energy. There was a matter of battling depression and anxiety and a really bad abusive relationship, but what really bothered me was how lost I suddenly felt. How I didn't even know what I wanted. I was pre-med at first because of my family's expectations, majored in chemistry even. But the more I spent time with the people in my major and how narrow-minded they were (no other interests or facets about them except to be the best in the chemistry--nearly all of them pre-med), I grew disheartened and stopped caring about just studying and cramming for exams. I didn't want be a doctor. It showed in my performance. The final year, I broke away from my major and just pursued random classes that interested me, which was nice! Yet, this was the year I was supposed to be looking for jobs and finding a career path.  Now that I'm two years out, I haven't been able to secure a long term job because I am either 1)overqualified 2)random of 3) have no real job experience. In other words, the same as you. The internships that I have had only showed me how much my personality is at odds with the work force. I am not the 9-5 person... What doesn't help is that everyone I know keeps telling me, ""Oh but you're SO smart. Just pick something for now"" and it's beginning to make me feel stupid that I can't find one job that won't depress me even more. The problem with depression is that you're highly sensitive to ANYTHING that could bring you down even more. I don't know how to get out of that dilemma. I'm a very emotionally intense and sensitive person who knows how to hide how much she's hurting on the inside very well.  I've had to move back home, swallow my pride, and accept ""reality""--or at least find serenity in who I am and all the different parts of me. It's hard. The more I try to look for the right job or the right answer, the less I seem to be sure of anything. As a result, I'm totally burned out. I barely make my own bed either, let alone even try to put on a full outfit of clothes (underwear and a big t-shirt if I have no reason to leave the house). The whole ""what's the point"" logic.  My main point is that you're not alone. I wish I stuck to something, and changing my mind all the time is looking like it's a matter of self-sabotage. To battle the depression though, I have been seeing a therapist pretty regularly for the past few months and it does help. It's just nice to talk to someone who has measures in battling the deep emptiness inside."

Trying to sell yourself as a creative for an entry level chemistry job is suicide, it's so frustrating. Seems like everyone wants a 9-5 drone! I'm procrastinating the real world by returning to college to get my masters, even though chemistry is such a stress in my life. I'm hopeful though - we've got a lot to share with the world too."
ENFP,3cu14i,Celatid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"Blows my mind how similar ENFP's are. I just graduated from college with a major in Biology. Throughout my entire time in college my goal was to go to medical school. I studied so hard and actually did really well, I actually kind of liked Organic Chem too. I was doing research for 15 hours a week for 2 1/2 years, 16-18 credits a semester, vice president of pre-med club, and I was in countless other organizations. By my senior year I was COMPLETELY burnt out. I postponed applying to medical school as a junior, postponed my MCAT (which I never took), and now after graduation I have no intentions of going to medical school. I'm completely against the idea. Luckily I have extremely supportive parents. I have no idea what I am going to do now and I'm currently jobless. I loath research and I know too much about health care from all the volunteering and internships I've done to know that I would never be happy practicing medicine (which I could go on and on about). My junior year of college I fell into this HORRIBLE depression. I was self harming and I started going to therapy at the student health center. They didn't really help much, but it probably wasn't their fault because I'm really bad at expressing my emotions and opening up. It took me a while to admit what was causing it. I was so burnt out, didn't have any close friends in my college town, and ultimately didn't know how to tell my dad I didn't want to be a doctor (he's a doctor). Although I don't know what I am going to do yet, I've been extremely optimistic about it because I like EVERYTHING. Knowing I don't like something has helped a little.  You sound so stressed out, I've been there. You should take a year or two off. Get a job doing anything that seems fun to you. Seriously! Just get out of medicine for a little bit. So may pre-meds (like my past self) are obsessed with studying so hard to find out they'll only be denied from medical school. You should just take it easy you've done so well and worked so hard you're allowed to take a little break.  Maybe even teach for america or work at a restaurant and meet people your age. You're young and so accomplished your number one priority right now should be to be happy. Go to counseling, get a small job, take an art class, whatever it take to make you feel like yourself again."

I have very similar stories to the ones posted already, and recently went through a burnout after leaving my previous job in the social sector (working with teenagers). I've been on prescription meds for depression for quite a while now and have been wondering lately if depression and ENFP is a common thing.   Also funnily enough with the job talk happening, I left a job which at one point was my dream job, took a drop in pay and now work doing photography for a skate shop + the odd bit here and there for extra money, but i enjoy it, it's flexible and gives me room and time to breathe. I'm qualified for many different and far higher paying positions, but I find that at this point in my life it's definitely a weight off of my shoulders and helps with life being a little easier some days."

When we all are changing and growing and during different seasons of our life, we will be different places, mindsets, and what have you. We make friends with those in similar situations and seasons. And as an ENFP, we are lucky that that it is pretty easy for us to find new groups and friends.   So...meet people, and enjoy them for whatever amount of time they are in your life.

I was so sick, I was hallucinating pixel mosquitoes in a videogame-like atmosphere. The screen flashed red every time they passed each other, and they never met again after that. It just kept going faster and faster.  Made me realize I was afraid of being a leech. That I drew something from companionship with other people that I was worried would eventually drive them away. Since then, I've gone through several sets of friends. I look back, and in some cases I can see certain things I did that escalated the situation, and I've mistreated some people. As a general rule, though, it's just been life. People drift away because their priorities shift, or they meet new people they want to hang out with.  Bottom line: I think this happens with all types. I feel like we're just wired to notice it more. I know I feel the pain from every broken friendship. They weigh on me, just like the Doctor's companions weigh on him. I could live a lot easier with it, if I could just find that one immortal woman willing to share the pain with me."
ENFP,3crbsc,JeremiahKassin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:32:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely! I don't know if you've seen Michael Pierce's mini-lecture on ENFP's on youtube, but he uses the (11th) Doctor as an example of ENFP's for that specific purpose! My phases tend to last about 4-5 years though, and I try to include them in my lives as much as possible beyond that period, even when intimacy doesn't come naturally anymore, because anyone I've shared my soul with is still important to me. I also have a huge group of people that I can just hit up and hang out with though, and I guess that's what you're saying you don't have? Those people are obviously not as important and participant in my life as the closer ones, though. I think a characteristic of ENFP's is being able to charm most people they meet into friendship, but becoming extremely (maybe a little too much) attached to the people they want to share their ideas and hearts with.   Here is the ENFP video if you're interested! It might have some answers for you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wQXkIjdAJk"

ENFP,3ctlcw,WaxyPumpkin72,4,Fri Jul 10 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"ENFPs get accused of flirting or pressing themselves too hard on people that don't want to date and are hypersensitive to someone being friendly to them. To the ENFP, they're just being a friendly person.   But over time, especially with female ENFPs they have to curb themselves from showing interest and sending mixed messages. And if she's like me, I don't like making the first move, because I always jump in too quickly before I've actually seen if the other person is attracted to me for me, or if they're only into me for the convenience and just going along for the ride. The second really sucks the life out of you, and you end up carrying the relationship. So...I wait for the other person to be obviously into me. It's what I need to stamp out my own self doubt. So I don't push too hard or pull too hard anymore, I let the other person direct to keep myself from being so overbearing. Your mileage may vary for your own ENFP.   So my guess is that she was letting you guide things, because she didn't want to push too hard, over interpret the situation, etc. Coffee is just coffee unless someone obviously expresses that it's more than that. Then someone came along and actually made their own intentions clear. So she went with it, instead of holding out for you, and your window of opportunity closed. Now that you've made it obvious you want to go on a date and not just hang out, she's letting you know the situation.   Don't wait around for her to become single. But if she does, you can go for it."

I think there is (was?) a general sense that extroverts are a large and loud majority, so introverts need advocates.  We may talk more, but we sometimes have trouble expressing ourselves, just like introverts.   My SO and I are an I/E relationship, too.  To start, it was a lot of me staying in with him and trying to understand his needs better.  I gained his trust, now he does the same for me.  We've never had resources, but have learned to say ""I need ____ right now because _____.""  We've sat down numerous times to talk about the way we tick and the way we get energy.  It's hard sometimes, but as with most things, communication makes all the difference."

ENFP,3cpk43,pinkwashed,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:35:59 2015 UTC,That's a fair assessment. I feel like I have enough friends that I can have philosophical discussions with that it won't be much different in that aspect though.
ENFP,3cpk43,thebry,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:35:52 2015 UTC,"Hey, just read your posting on the ESFJ board. Am on mobile so sorry for any formatting. I am an ENFP and my fiancé is an ESFJ. It's really nice to see that pair up mentioned :-)  This is obviously biased towards my own relationship and limited to my simplified understanding of the personality types.   My spouse and I work really well together. He picks up the slack for my dreamy ways. I have creative ideas for us and he helps us to follow through with them. I have my head in the clouds and he keeps his feet on the ground, and if you guys can find balance and appreciation in that, you'll really complement each other. It's all a matter of seeing the value of the traits that the other person has that you don't. My spouse is very particular about time and I'm flaky at times. His routine helps me to have routine, and my easygoing attitude means that when something spontaneously happens, I don't get bent out of shape about it. His commitment to career works for us, because I'd rather have the freedom of autonomy to be creative or go back to school or make money through my art (I'm currently at a traditional job right now but the long-term goal is to allow me some flexibility, while he's an engineer.) We both share the F trait, so we are both extremely affectionate and share our love for each other through physical acts and loving words. As I'm creative, he's received songs and art and scrapbooks and cooking and completely custom gifts over our time together. He's always so amazingly grateful and he really values the time and effort and creativity I put into things.   The one thing that I struggle with is the ""J"" of it all - I'm very perceptive and get really turned off by judgemental people. He has trouble seeing things from other people's points of view. The important thing is that we communicate and he's open to understanding. My perception and extroverted nature allows me to say, ""but have you ever thought about it like this?"" and he's receptive to it. He just doesn't think to do it on his own. Thankfully, we're both very open minded, it just means that it takes a little more effort on my part to explain things to him in a way that he can relate, but he does eventually get it.   As the other poster said, we don't have much for philosophical discussion - but I have so many wonderful friends and frankly, the internet, that I don't really go without. From a personal standpoint, I've had two serious relationships in which I really valued the philosophical debate - but it got exhausting sometimes. And those people, while intelligent, weren't what I needed romantically. I can have philosophical discussion with anyone, but no one holds me quite as perfectly as my ESFJ. No one knows quite the right thing to say when I'm feeling down. It's just a matter of what your needs are in a relationship. I thought that I needed to be with someone who had the same kind of intelligence as I do. Eventually I learned that having two people that think so similarly is just too much. No one gets to ever turn their brain off.   Awhile back on reddit, there was a comment that really stuck with me in regards to different needs in relationships. It really resonated with me and brought a lot to light. I mourned that I wouldn't have a ""mind mate"", but I also learned to embrace my help and play mate. I have friends that I consider to be soul mates, and I have friends that I consider to be mind mates (some are both). I'm not lacking in those. But the person that I need, day to day, to share a home with and parent with and create memories with - I need help. And I need play. I need those every day and he provides that to me.   Sorry for going a little off, but I'm on mobile so I just started rambling lol. Hope that it's OK to link in this forum.   https://np.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32fw5u/well_this_is_boring_as_hell_me_32f_with_my/cqay89b  Good luck with your dude! If you can both appreciate the values that you individually bring to the relationship, I think that you'll be very happy together!"

I resonate with the metaphor of being in the clouds while he tethers me to the ground. I'll have to work with the J part. I used to have a friend that was an ISTJ, and I had to leave that friendship in the dust because he just felt so toxic to be around. I'm just not cut out for judging people. It feels wrong. Luckily, I don't think C is even close to that judgy. I don't feel like I need to have philosophical discussions with who I like. I'd rather just go have fun and party with C. Sometimes he's receptive to talk about things of that nature, but I don't need him to be all the time. He also really does seem to know what needs to be said to pick me up when I'm feeling low, which unfortunately is quite often. I gots lots of issues. Anyway, thanks for the awesome response! I'll be sure to check out that link too.  Edit: After checking out the link, which I've seen before somewhere now that I think about it...maybe /r/bestof?....I think that what I'm looking for is a mostly a playmate and a soulmate. I'm not 100% sure about where C is looking for a soulmate right now, but I know that playmate lines up well.

A lot of the times when I don't feel appreciated, I try to understand why, and most of the time I come to the conclusion that I am appreciated in some way or another, and I'm fine.    When I really feel like I'm not appreciated it makes me try harder for a while and then just give up on that person. This has made work life very hard for me throughout my life. What happens to me is this:    A colleague tells me ""Situation X occured yesterday and I was so annoyed by it"". Then next time I tell them ""Hey I did this and that so situation X won't happen to you again"" and they tell me it's 'the normal way of doing things' and don't understand why I mention it.  I know they're right and everyone is expected to make sure this situation doesn't occur, but still, you mentioned that you got annoyed before when it happened and I paid extra attention to make sure it didn't happen again.

ENFP,3cnscl,jusdifferent,2,Thu Jul 9 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"Haha, to elaborate on what others have said - you're hitting the nail on the head.  Yes - I'm not sure it's just an ENFP thing but I do get absorbed in doing ""my"" thing - whether it's a routine I stick to or wanting to go out after weeks of staying in or planning for my future goals... my extroversion sometimes requires a 'share and be shared with' exchange and introverted types can't always do that - so sometimes it seems like there is a disconnection or communication barriers and those can be very frustrating.  But I really appreciate when someone can work with that, or understands that there are differences in how we approach things.  On your second point - I really think ENFPs love in a very overt way.  Affectionate, expressive - and it does sometimes get lonely when love isn't reciprocated in a way we can understand.  Luckily, a pretty large aspect of our personalities involves self-analysis, so while I can't speak for others, I can say I am pretty quick to put myself back in line when I realize I'm being selfish by expecting someone to love like I do.  I recognize that others, especially introverted types, express their affection differently.    That said, yes - we need to feel appreciated, but appreciation can take many forms.  Re: self-analysis - it's very important to realize when you're projecting your expectations onto others."

ENFP,3co4od,enfpadhdconfusedgirl,4,Thu Jul 9 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, as an ISTP I actually find your type to be my favorite to be around.  It is possible that you might be interpreting some of your new supervisor's reactions as negative, when really its just how we express ourselves. Generally speaking, we are direct and to the point (yet often sarcastic). If something is not of interest, we do not engage -- even if that comes off as strange, socially. This is because it requires a lot of energy to engage in small talk.  I totally understand the desire to want to connect with this person, but this might have to be reframed a bit when you are dealing with an ISTP. The path to connecting with an ISTP involves finding a mutual subject that you both like. We are obsessive when it comes to our interests, and all of the deep bonds I have formed with people over the years have come from the shared interest in the activity.  This might be a bit of a departure for you if you way of connecting is more people or interpersonal-oriented (if that makes sense).  Good luck on the training. If the ISTP is invested in the activity he/she will be a very dependable and hard worker who will learn fast. Financial management does not sound like a great fit for an ISTP, but I don't know the details of the work.  Feel free to ask me any follow-up questions if I can be helpful.

This morning, I asked him where he was from and after him not asking me where I was from, I just started giving him probably too much information about where I was from. Either way, definitely disinterested with the exception of his cat, which i dont own and can't connect with.  I worry about the tone of the office and if he even cares about what I do (don't judge, work for the federal government. We are a HQ office with both budget and finance functions...he only knows the budget side and I'm on the accounting side). When your type  ask questions,  do they typically want a short direct response? I am on the expository side and tend to give very detailed answers, but sometimes im just not sure what he's asking.   Thanks again!"
ENFP,3co4od,dealthegrasstyson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:40:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, great. I'm glad that you asked him what his personality type was and he identified with being an ISTP. I was a little concerned that if he turned out to be an ISTJ my advice might not really be helpful. Come to think of it, if he is interested in MBTI stuff that might be a source of conversation.  This might sound cliche, but I would suggest that you be yourself as much as possible. Unfortunately, when it comes to anything interpersonal or emotional we are just awful at reciprocating. For example, I have been in a 10 year relationship with an INFP who I care for more than anyone in the world. However, it took her at least 5 years to accept that I am really uncomfortable hugging or saying ""I love you"". Instead we tend to show our affection through action, which can be difficult for some people to accept (understandably).  Also, it might help to keep in mind that ISTP or not, some people are just not friendly. That's their problem.  Part of what I like about ENFPs are that you genuinely want to understand people. We, on the other hand, want to understand things. I think if you keep that subtle difference in mind it might help you find some mutual ground so as to make your working day a little more tolerable!

I find something interesting about everything, I have this natural curiosity, I love reading articles and talking about it, but working in these fields, GOD it's not for me. But now, I don't have the choice, and I have to keep in this way, at least until I get a Bachelor degree.    I love learning things, how things works etc... Like I said, I'm very curious about everything, but I don't have enough will to work in STEM. Since I was a kid I always wanted to ""be a scientist"", I did a high school diploma in science, but I found very lately that I'm not made to work there. Too much to know, too much work for me, too much application etc... Now I think that I'm more of a ""thinking person"", meaning that I like to discuss about things, conceive, analyse, communicate etc... And I'm also into art now (before I was like... ""meh, nice painting"").    And the people in computer science are too much into computers and video games. I love video games, really, I want to work in the industry, but they always talk about it, they're always playing etc...    I think that in general people in STEM fields aren't enough open-minded. I'm not saying that they're all the stereotypical ""nerd with glasses"" seeing everything with logic and maths, but I don't see a lot of people there being interesting in very various things.

At the same time I tried research and found it intensely lonely and too......slow.... to really satisfy me. So I felt pure science was out.

I might feel a little burned out, but it's only because the first week is well, a lot of hours. It's getting better. The majority of my day is dedicated to work. But that's PGY-1 year, you know?   However, now that I'm getting into the swing of things, man is it cool. And sometimes it's a little frightening. You really don't know when that patient in psychosis is going to switch off on you. Yet there's still a physical exam to be done, a heart to be listened to. Being aware keeps me on my toes. And seeing how people can improve is dramatic as hell. We had a patient come in a little while ago, who was so psychotic they were mute and had no history other than a drivers licence.

ENFP,3cl02f,thissistheN,9,Wed Jul 8 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"As an ENFP woman, I'd say she's trying to let you down without hurting your feelings. ENFPs HATE hurting people or making them feel bad, and sometimes don't realize that by skirting around the issue instead of being honest it can be confusing, hard-to-read, and hurtful in that way. I'm assuming you guys are pretty young, and she probably hasn't developed the part of herself yet that realized just being honest is the best way. Her approach sounds like something I would have done when I was a teenager/earlier 20-something.   I would say that probably the best route is to just keep being friends with her, and act like you always have (not easy with feelings involved, I know). The thing about ENFPs is that once you've tipped your hand you don't have to wonder how they feel about you. We aren't good at keeping our feelings under wraps.   Sorry, that's probably not what you wanted to hear. You're clearly a thoughtful, self-aware, caring person, and that right there is awesome. Best of luck to you, INTJ friend!"
ENFP,3cl02f,bananacow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:17:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's good to hear from somebody that may have some insight into her thoughts. And we're both 23. One thing I didn't mention, though, is that she is formerly engaged (called off maybe 8 or 9 months ago) so I understand if she's in a place where she's not ready to be in a relationship yet.   and act like you always have (not easy with feelings involved, I know)   That's actually not hard at all for me haha. I almost feel like I may have confused her with how aloof I've acted after I had expressed interest. If anything, if I'm unsure that anything is being reciprocated, I'm more likely to act like nothing is going on since subconsciously, being on the uneven side of an equation is a form of weakness in my mind (whether or not that's true is another matter; my attitudes towards certain things take a long time to deconstruct)."
ENFP,3cl02f,bananacow,3,Wed Jul 8 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"Oh that makes sense. Yeah, knowing she was previously engaged definitely throws a wrench in things. She could just be not ready, like you said.

For your own mental sanity (you are overanalyzing as we do) I suggest two options.   Move on. Don't engage, don't text. Only speak when spoken to. Gauge what happens. The downside to this is you will continue overthinking if there is communication. Confront. ""Hey, you seemed cool, I wanted to take you out. If you're not down with that, peace"" or however kids talk these days. This option gives you the advantage of closure. You'll know if she's interested or not almost immediately.    Either way just remember; she may seem likes she's ""the shit"" right now, but you have no idea and don't know her well enough to know. There are other women that will like you, let her go if you need to."

I posted not really to figure out what to do, but more to understand what's going through her head. I'm in no rush/need to be in a relationship, so if she opens up down the road, I'd be open to that. It's hard to cut it off entirely just because we're almost guaranteed to see each other every week. Getting closure as you put it would seem to make things a lot more awkward than it needs to be in the future. My interest has been put out there, what she chooses to do with it is up to her."

Taken it a few times since and always got ENFP. Just out of curiosity. How do you know she's an ENFP? I don't think I know anyone else's personality type and even if I do happen to mention Myers Briggs they usually haven't heard of it. Did you like, ask her to take the test or something?   By the way, /u/bananacow is totally 100% right. Although, one thing I will add is that (generalization alert!) women are slightly different to men in one sense. For instance I've never found an unattractive girl become attractive to me, I might find someone a little bit attractive and they grow hugely on me where they're now very attractive but I've never had someone that I didn't find attractive get to the point where I was actually attracted to them. I have seen this multiple times with girls though. They will be completely uninterested in a guy but after getting to know them, spending time with them, etc. they become interested. I'm not saying it will, but it could happen. For now though dude, trust me, she isn't attracted. Try to build your friendship. Don't pursue hanging out with her one on one. Just tell yourself that it's not on and don't build your expectations. If it's meant to be it will be. You can't force a person to like you though. She's either gonna like you or not."

I didn't really intend to pursue one on one after I was initially ""turned down"", that would seem needy.

I've always been insecure that I didn't go to an ivy league or even top 100 university, not sure why. As for how I deal with that, I don't know.

I feel like I have all these great ideas and want to learn about anything and everything in the world and am very capable of doing so and simultaneously feel as if though I'm a complete underachiever and that people think of me as one too. I sometimes wish I would just do things conventionally like everyone else says is the right way to do things, but that's very difficult for me. It isn't as effective if I am going by what is standard but I couldn't really do it any other way. I am still confident I will end up being proud of what I have achieved but it saddens me a lot of people will consider me to be so ""lost"" in the meantime."

I feel like a complete disappointment 75% of the time because I'm positive I've only landed multiple great opportunities because I'm extremely charming and I look good on paper because of these other great opportunities on my resume that I charmed my way into.  I've felt like this since I got into college - I get what I want (and don't really deserve) because I have references that are really into my potential, and then I end up disappointing my supervisors when they find out they got duped and are stuck with a very funny but scatterbrained and incompetent student/employee.  I'm like a conman but instead of embezzling or whatever, I get paid to turn in shitty work because I'm too frazzled and inexperienced. Although I feel like a conman wouldn't feel like complete shit at the end of every day because I can legitimately feel everyone's disappointment."

Try to focus on your achievements and try to follow-up more on your tasks. That's all I can say... Or try to find a job that will utilize your supreme social skills.

ENFP,3cgsq6,amsiz,3,Mon Jul 20 08:11:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I feel like a huge failure with loads of different parts of my life. The one thing I've done ok with is starting my own business. It was a Kickstarter project a while back and still growing. Now I just force myself to focus on that and hope that everything else will come together once it gets closer to where I want it to be.  But, essentially, before that I had literally no idea what I was going to do and it somehow randomly happened and now at least I have something good to focus on.

ENFP,3cgsq6,LumosEnlightenment,3,Wed Jul 8 01:58:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. For the record, I feel like everyone has their demons and insecurities about who they are in the world and those who don't are just kidding themselves.   I've been through a pretty life changing 2 years where I have had to take a hard look at who I am, what I believe, I discovered MBTI, and I've started to see my major flaws that I'll never be able to change but also my strengths that make up for the weaknesses. I'll never be done figuring out who I am, but I'm really happy and proud of the fact that I'm finally starting to know who I am and be confident and proud of that person. I had allowed me to see the important things in life and not be jaded by the shiny things like wealth, comparisons to others, and stupid people's opinion of me.   One thing I know that I do is self sabotage by way of procrastination and I hate this about myself. I'm in a job that is incredible with so much freedom, but I'm finding that I cannot self regulate or self motivate very well at all. I ideally should also be highly organized to do this job, and I am not organized at all. I've been a personal assistant for almost 3 years now who constantly feels like I'm holding on by the skin of my teeth, but then I think about the things I bring to the table: I'm able to take things as they come and roll with the punches (and there are a lot of punches that come my way often), I'm calm in a crisis and I can keep my boss calm so he doesn't sue anyone, I'm willing to go above and beyond because I truly care about the people I work for. Someone who is type A, organized, and schedule oriented wouldn't be able to do any of the things I can do and, in my situation at least, my skills are more important.   I also know that this is just temporary in the grand scheme of things. I don't know what I'm going to end up doing in the long run, but this is where I am right now. I hope to one day do something that makes a difference in the world, but for now I'll settle with staying put while I continue to learn about who I am and see where life takes me.   It's all about perspective. I don't know what you're going through, but I hope what I said helps you in some way. And when all else fails, fake it till you make it."

I was a ""true pleasure"" to have in class as said by every teacher I had from first to ninth grade. My parents where some of the few who actually looked forward to going to parent teacher conferences.  I think it was that I quickly understood what the teachers were trying to teach and I saw them as just another human who needed help from time to time and I knew what my classmates where think and dealing with because I was one of them so I was the student in class doing my best to get the two side to be able to talk and accomplish the goal of education.

I could never sleep in a crib because it was confining and I'd cry.   I loved and still love space and astronomy, as well as cars and video games. I'd spend hours (or want to) talking with my family about all my game and car ideas and wondering what it would be like to go to space. We have an upright grand piano in our library that I'd bang on as a kid and now have learned to play with mild aptitude.  Hella emotional, too. Lots of crying and lots of being ecstatic and excited. Super extroverted, and still am. The more people, the better; even if I didn't know them. I ran up to an old guy fishing at a park and proclaimed to him that I am Buzz Lightyear. Have always been an avid reader too, especially for fantasy.  My parents say I was an altruistic and idealistic kid, and I think they're correct because I'm still like that now. Maybe a little more self-preservational, but that's just because I'm a cautious person. Got it from my dad.  I'd like to think I was a pretty cool kid.  Now, a hard fight with depression and unsupported schools have caused apathy and boredom to leech into my heart. Went from caring about everything to only the essentials, and even that's slipping now. Like I said, I still love space and music and reading, but most of the personality is gone. It's made for a strange person for people to be around. Because of that not many people are around me. At least I'm alive at all though, and there's always poetry and singing to vent frustration with.  Of course I'm still a teenager, all is not lost. It feels like it but I know that's not rational. Maybe if I'm able to start a band or have a video game kick off it'll give a little kick in the ass to whatever decided to slow down in my head."

ENFP,3cerw4,snazzlespritz,3,Tue Jul 7 19:09:09 2015 UTC,I was really independent (maybe that's just cuz im the youngest of 4 though). Mom mom always tells me the story that when I was like 3 or 4 she found me trying to change a dead light bulb above my crib.
ENFP,3cerw4,lifelibertypizza,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"I have very introverted, overprotective parents and was an only child, so maybe that affected things.  I was a very well-behaved kid. I'd sit patiently in the doctor's office while my mom was in there or whatever and just be happy doing my own thing. I never really had a rebellious phase. My parents had a lot of rules and even though I wanted to stay out with my friends until all hours of the night as a teeneager, I knew my parents wouldn't like it and they would worry so I didn't even really ask because it wasn't really worth it and I didn't want to have the conversation.  Teachers always loved me and I did really well in school. When I was a kid, I was always like, ""let's do this, guys!"" I got really into theater for a while. I took piano lessons for over 10 years but never consistently sat down to practice. Luckily, my piano teacher was very relaxed, she was wonderful. I wasn't very competitive and never played sports. My mom asked me if I wanted to join a soccer team and I said, ""sure, that sounds fun, but I don't really want to keep score, just kick the ball around and have fun."" Always was very creative and artsy. Played a lot of make believe games by myself and with my childhood friend. Room was always messy. Still is, most of the time. Took me forever to clean because I'd find a toy and start playing with it. Once my mom got fed up and cleaned it without telling me and I was SUPER PISSED that she touched all my stuff without telling me. I kept journals from a young age, but never wrote in them consistently. I had a bunch of half-empty journals because I kept wanting a new pretty one after I had fallen off the wagon of writing. I played computer games like The Sims, Rollercoaster Tycoon, and Zoo Tycoon. I liked building stuff. I always had grand plans for what I'd build, but never finish it.  I have a lot more friends now than when I was a kid or teenager or even college, perhaps due in part to having more freedom."

One year's nothing, and even if it will be hard at moments, now I'm prepared to face the future.    I like to think that the important moments in life are the ""low ones"", when it's hard, when you're sad, when you're angry, when you're alone, when you're lost, when you don't have any choice. Because they make us consider our limits, they make us consider what is really important to us, and what is not, they make us grow as a human being, they make us learn things from oursleves and from the world.

The prevailing ""N>S"" stereotype really encourages people to try and identify with traits that may or may not actually be their ""best fit"" personality.  I mean, there are supposed to be about the same number of ENFP's as ESFP's (slightly more ESFP's by most accounts) in the world, yet the ENFP subreddit has over ten times as many subscribers! People might try to argue that reddit is an ""N"" website, but... I mean, let's not fool ourselves. The majority of the site consists of rehashing the same types of jokes and memes over and over again, hardly something I'd consider typical of N's (at the very least, it's not something N's do more than S's). People might go on to argue that the function stack for ESFP's specifically (with the dominant Se) tend away from the internet, but there is clearly plenty here to keep them entertained, as many websites (tumblr, this subreddit, etc.) show.  I am certainly not trying to complain about this phenomenon, I appreciate the company of ESFP's (and S's generally), it's just something that you'll have to accept if you're in an unverified N-type community."

ENFP,3ccyzt,iburnedparadise,5,Mon Jul 6 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"Cutting off unbalanced friendships is tough, but necessary IMO. I can give you my point of view as an INTJ if that helps you any.  Friendships are extremely important to me, but I also have a much narrower definition of friendship. Basically, anybody that I can safely feel like I can be myself with I consider a friend, and everybody else is an acquaintance. This means that effectively I have 9 people that I consider ""real"" friends. Apart from immediate family, these are the most important people in my life, and I have built such a close relationship with them, that regardless of how much time goes by without contact, the relationship stays intact. Everybody else is an acquaintance.  This sounds harsh to most people, and I understand that. For many INTJs, social energy tends to be scarce, and therefore very valuable. Social interactions with acquaintances require much more energy investment that those with friends. The less I know someone, and feel comfortable around them, the more energy investment it requires. The more energy investment an interaction requires, the less likely it is that it will be enjoyable for both parties.  Don't get me wrong, this doesn't excuse rude behavior, such as frequently cancelling at the last second, or not replying to messages. What I'm trying to get at, is that most likely, he did not value your friendship to the same degree that you did. It's a very tough realization, but a very valuable one in the long term. Stay strong, and focus on what you have learned from this experience so that you can detect this pattern in the future. You will have countless acquaintances that will fade away through life, and that's OK. Accept that, and focus on identifying and nurturing the close and reciprocal relationships. These are the ones that will stick around for years to come. :) hug"
ENFP,3ccyzt,killerfox,3,Tue Jul 7 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment! <3  I've actually heard the same kind of definition from another INTJ! I think I have a similar kind of categorisation with friends - my 'best friends' (confusingly they're on the second tier; this guy was on the first tier) are the same definition as your friends whilst my own 'friends' are perhaps closer to your definition to your acquaintances.    Apart from immediate family, these are the most important people in my life, and I have built such a close relationship with them, that regardless of how much time goes by without contact, the relationship stays intact.   In my friendship, this was how it used to be actually until two years ago when contact became sporadic and minimal and it felt like he stopped caring (although he said he still did and said before I was his best friends but his actions indicated otherwise and other things ofc). It was that realisation that as you said was the hardest - but it's comforting to know that it'll be valuable!"

I have a ENTJ friend who doesn't understand why I feel bad about it at all.

I especially get triggered by something that makes me feel nostalgic. I am a really sentimental person and I keep a lot of random things in my past and every time I go through them I get that feeling. I also feel it when I'm watching movies and listening to music too.

So I find myself sucking in as much of the world as possible.  And when I do that, it lessens what my original pain was, but I'm still labile, so appreciating what I have, and the beauty of the world in the presence of whatever I've just lost is a little overwhelming.

Usually when I tell people I'm close to, it weirds them out, my best friend (INFJ) excluded. It can put me in such a good mood, but that comes with a cost, I suppose."

A gorgeous sunset, a great instrumental piece, two people kissing, etc. I found that writing is a great outlet for these overwhelming emotions. I write a lot of poetry whenever I feel this way, and it usually does a good job of leveling me out. There's been words for it like ""empath"" and such. I seriously thought there was something wrong with me for the longest time.

Like I was watching Inside Llewyn Davis last night and the scene where he plays the song for the music manager just floored me. Not just crying but thinking about how tragic life is and on and on. Spent a few hours just trying to comprehend how and why we exists and why life can be so sad. Not depressing at all just trying to comprehend my emotions and how they line up with existence in general. Happens like once every two weeks."

Like, i'll see a building with cool angles or in a cool lighting or something and i cant stop staring at it because i marvel at how amazing it is that i'm here to witness this spectacularly cool building. (random example but it does happen pretty often, admittedly) I go out on walks as often as possible just to absorb beauty of everyday things around me as often as possible and sometimes I tear up just looking at things like a pretty sunset or like. a dog wagging its tail or something. It's like that for me all the time whenever I see anything slightly pretty like trees or birds or the sky and it really gets my thoughts racing off to ""Wow the universe is a miracle"" or something like that until i come back down to earth again a few minutes later. I honestly love that about me because life is much more fun when you appreciate small things in life like that!!! I'm happy to know other ENFPs experience it too!!"

It could be that emotionally you aren't available to connect with your friends like that. Try reading about ESFPs as well.

ENFP,3c8msy,JeremiahKassin,2,Mon Jul 6 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"The ENFP is a bit of a crazy one in my experience of being one, and having friends who are. To describe an ENFP as 'typical' is anything but - every ENFP I have met has been different in their own regards!  Personally, I feel that when I'm sad I become more of an INFJ. I lose my functions of being erratic, loud and the life of a party to residing in this little cave of mine where my thoughts are internal and I feel constantly restless, searching for a purpose (hence the judgement function). INTJ seems quite different to ENFP, the two are compatible but it seems quite odd that you would have such a radical contrast. Just my thoughts on the topic though."
ENFP,3c8msy,Dejay79,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:29:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we're all different in similar ways. I love coming to this sub because I always know there's going to be someone who just gets what I'm saying."

ENFP,3c8msy,Maiden_Sunshine,2,Mon Jul 6 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"I think I've read that extreme duress can cause your functions to completely flip, so you were probably behaving like an ISTJ, and got mistyped because your intuitive nature was still showing through. I think I'm just coming out of a flip, myself.  As to why you're having trouble connecting with your friends-well, maybe it's because they're too close. When I really expose myself to someone emotionally, which is something that happens quite often, and they react ...poorly, I have trouble trusting them again. Maybe that's what's going on?"
ENFP,3c8msy,Maiden_Sunshine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:03:40 2015 UTC,"That sounds highly likely! I also think the moving across the country has something to do with it, and a lot of my friends are still new, and I tend to neglect my older friendships."
ENFP,3c8msy,TheACT,2,Mon Jul 6 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"The test is merely a guide. I did test as ENFP, but I also examined each function on its own to see if I indentified as ENFP, and I did.  We use all functions and just the majority of the time are ENFP. So when you take the test you may have been another type in a temporary technical sense.  When I lose sight of my purpose and under stress/obsessed with a certain goal, I exhibit most qualities of an ENTJ.   But an INTJ turning out to be an ENFP is hilarious, because I feel like telling my bro (INTJ) amidst manatical laughter that our recruitment of his kind is a success. Just to horrify him."
ENFP,3c8msy,TheACT,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:46:13 2015 UTC,I have an extremely INTJ room mate and I think that would be hilarious as well. I am also nothing like him. This describes it perfectly.

ENFP,3c8rth,lionandpeace,4,Sun Jul 5 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"any thoughts, feelings, quirks and perks you've discovered   I'm fairly high on the intuitive scale. I've noticed a few things because of it. All of which have a good and bad side.   I frequently and easily finish other peoples sentences. especially if they pause to search for a word that woudl fit what they are trying to say. I know what people want to say before they finish their thoughts which leads to most conversations flow slower than I'd like them too. While at the same time as knowing what they want to say I also quickly find a comical or inappropriate option of what they 'could' say and will likely supply that option (that's what a great deal of my humor is based on) I act based on alleviating my perceptions of how others will likely feel about a certain situation before they even have the feeling I think that they will have.    So for all of these they are good when I am right but can go badly if I'm wrong. After 35 years of studying people, I'm right more often than wrong. But some exceptional people continue to surprise me and catch me off guard."

Yeah, I definitely have this! I have a joke with one of my ENTP friends about how I'm always predicting her sentence. We finish each other's sentences a lot of the time and because of our relatively high intuitions, we connect on a more intellectually provoking and mentally promiscuous level, which is of course very enticing!   I know what people want to say before they finish their thoughts which leads to most conversations flow slower than I'd like them too.   Definitely a lot of impatience with this one. Some people who aren't on the same level as you, it can be quite frustrating that the ideas don't flow that quickly whereas I can think of ideas on the spot and connect them together coherently very quickly.   While at the same time as knowing what they want to say I also quickly find a comical or inappropriate option of what they 'could' say and will likely supply that option (that's what a great deal of my humor is based on)   Love these moments! When they're trying to explain something or an anecdote, and you say a word or cutely swerve them into a different direction and they do a smile and laugh.   I act based on alleviating my perceptions of how others will likely feel about a certain situation before they even have the feeling I think that they will have.   Could you expand on this one? Had trouble following it."
ENFP,3c8rth,Dejay79,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"To explain that last point i'll use this example.   I'm out with a friend and I want to get ice cream, I know that she loves ice cream but that she is also trying to lose weight so instead of driving to the shoppe which is just over a mile away I instead suggest that we walk there. I'm may not want to walk myself but I'm willing to because I'm trying to avoid her having negative feelings about getting ice cream while on a diet."
ENFP,3c8rth,smokeout3000,3,Tue Jul 7 03:44:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I am so highly intuitive it has caused an extreme lack of introverted sensitivity in my behavior. My perception is so terribly one-sided that I simply can't create plans. I can only work with the potential the future holds. This is affecting me in a very negative way right now as I have lost my job and as of today, officially ran out of money, I completely rely on my intuition to capitalize on what could be simply because it has never let me down before. However the lack of opportunity in my current area may lead to my demise. Oh please intuition, pull me through just one more time."
ENFP,3c8rth,smokeout3000,3,Mon Jul 6 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"That sounds awful man! I understand how intuition can be quite a detriment as I've too lost jobs, messed up my exams in vain of reaching a higher goal. The 'now'/present are merely stepping stones to this idealistic future where my true goal and purpose have been met.   On a more serious note, this was quite worrying and daunting to read.

ENFP,3c8s6q,XOmniverse,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"The mind is the most powerful thing. If you can change your mindset, you can do almost anything. Don't focus on the past, don't focus on stress or worrying. Make goals for what you want to do in you're life, and if you want it bad enough you will make it happen. Life is about habits, if your always in a negative mood or not happy with how your life is, odds are your too comfortable with it (though you may hate it).  I highly recommend the books Think & Grow Rich and the extended version Law of Success to anyone who is looking to grow and make positive major changes in their life. Its never easy, but you got to start somewhere or you will spend the rest of your life in that funk. Don't take life for granted, its not easy for anyone. Everyone goes through major tough times, everyone. So don't forget that.  Keep reminding yourself that there are millions of other women out there as well. Its always a process to get over relationships, but you don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you, do you? There will be many out there that accept you for you.

It has definitely helped me get past some issues I had and I just can't explain how in touch with myself and with music I am on it.  It's definitely not for everyone.  You need to have a firm grip on who you are, reality and your surroundings.    My favorite experience isn't a spiritual movement but a visual moment. I walked into this art tent (there was also music playing) and someone came up to me and said 'Haha I get it' I looked up and the their was this art piece (when sober it just looked like chicken scratch) that I could see the sounds waves emanating off of it and the lines started laughing at me!

I could go on and on about it,  but I just want to let this community know what the effects were extreme on my personality especially.  I touched,  grabbed, and collected everything I could get ahold. I made spiritual epiphanies left and right.

ENFP,3c5n0l,Metacl,3,Sun Jul 5 13:40:32 2015 UTC,"I really, really want to try it. I took mushrooms two times already, and I absolutely loved the experience. But LSD is too hard to find now...    I think I'll post a trip report later, but right now I don't have the time."
ENFP,3c5n0l,Lumenis,3,Wed Jul 8 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, so there it is:    It was with 3 friends, and I already tries ""magic truffles"" with two of them, and this time we decided to go a bit ""further"": we took the ones called ""psilocybe Utopia"", rated as the most powerful on the site we bought it (I won't name it here, but if you want to know you can always PM me). It's sold by 15g sachets, but there's always a bit more inside (around 18-20g), we decided to get one per person. But, with an other friend, as I wanted a MAXI EXPERIENCE, we took a bit more, we shared a sachet of the less powerful, they came as a gift with the order. So I ate 20g of the most powerful truffles + around 10g of the less. It's a big dose, if you're not sure of what you're doing, if you hesitate a bit, if it's your first time, don't go that much. (NB: I went that much because the first time I tried truffles, I hade the same amount as my two friends, around 18g of a medium powerful specie, and I had almost zero effect, so I decided to go really into it).    Anyway. 3 pm, we begin to eat it. It does not taste good. At all. And as I knew how it taste, I decided to eat it all very quickly. In like 5 minutes I was done, whereas my friends weren't even at the third of they had. I'm glad ""it's over"", and I wait, chatting with my friends, the effects to show up.    Around 3:35pm, the first effects. Straight lines become slightly distored, I have like pins and needles all over my body, but I feel good, like in peace. I find some difficulties to talk clearly and my throat is like stuck, or closed, but that's a normal effect, at the beginning. So I don't care and I appreciate the beginning of the trip.    Around 3:50pm. I will call this moment ""H+0""(Hour 0), because after that I'm really tripping and completely lose my time perception, so I will describe it as how I felt it, but it's completely biased. So at this time, every shape is distorded, the room is like breathing, the outside light appears brighter, the shadow appears darker, the room feels completely different, and walking one meter away from my previous position feels like I'm in a totally different place. And a very little ""bad trip"" begins.    H+0 -> H+1. Everywhere, I saw skulls forming, or faces, looking at me, evily smiling. I knew it was an effect of the shrooms, I knew it was fake, I wasn't really scared but it felt odd. Looking at flowers, looking at the floor, looking at the wall, looking at my shirt, every shape and wolor was becoming a face looking at me. Even the clouds! But I decided to not really care and sat outside to look at the sky. And it was completely different. Besides the skull forming in the clouds, I saw the sky sometimes pink, sometimes yellow, the clouds were blue or greend. And there was like a filter in front of my eyes. I was still able to see clearly, but everywhere I would look at, there was this transparent shape, like a mandala, and it felt like it was between my eyes and the world. Like a filter used in photography, or a watermark. So I stayed there, looking at the sky, sometimes at the flowers, briefly chatting with a friend next to me, for about an hour. Sometime you want to talk and share, sometime you just want to feel the trip, in your own world.    H+1 -> H+2. One of my friend is a talented piano player (we were at his home), and began to play with his synthesizer. I didn't played any music, he just played with different sounds. Each new sound felt really differently, the music sounded deeper, like I was listening it directly with my soul, and with each ""song"", I felt like I was in a new place, my head full of images and mental pictures of fantastic, exotics, even extra-terrestrial places I have never been in, or even seen. I stayed sit in the couch, listening to him, with a a balloon in my hands. It was just an old balloon I found earlier that day, before the trip. Nothing particular. But at one moment, I saw him fly away in the garden, and I didn't wanted him to go, so I went out to save him. It was funny to touch, and squeeze, like a little living thing breathing in my hands. I really considered it like a buddy, I friend. I kept it during the rest of the day, even while eating, or sleeping. Eventually, it blew up, but I still have it in my wallet.    H+2 -> H+3. The most powerful part. I'm full of joy, I want to hug everyone, I want to do everything in the world. I want to go out and run, I want to watch the sky, talk to the cats, play music, listen to music, discourse on life, draw something, talk with my friends, anything and everything! But I ended up doing nothing except fooling around. During 15-20 minutes, I encountered some difficulties to stand up, to walk, or to properly think. Everything was messed up in my head, nothing and everything had a sense, and the time an idea poped in my head and I began to consider it, a dozens more appeared. I couldn't do anything because I couldn't concentrate more than 10 secondes. ENFP main problem Ultimate Edition.    H+3 -> H+5. The trip slowly ends, and the effects disappears, one after the other. This period is just peac. There is no side-effect, no hangover, no sensation of depression, lost of joy, nothing. Just peace, quiet, slow. We decided to sit outside and smoke weed. On funny thing, it's that we all wanted to smoke, at the exact same moment, and it feels like we could smoke a never-ending joint, just smoking and smoking, with having to make an other one. Slightly, minute after minute, I drifted into my own thoughts, forgetting everything else around me. On a deckchair, with a comfortable blanket, my buddy-balloon against my chest, a joint in my other hand, and I was watching how it burned, how the ember lived, how it consummed everything. It was a really deep moment for me. I didn't thought about anything in particular, I didn't felt anything in particular, I just lived the moment. No move, no word, just living. A trip is very difficult to explain to other people, because everyone live it differently, even your own trips are differents, because there are so many parameters that influence it; and it's even harder to explain it to someone who never had any psychedelic experience; but this moment, on that chair, this night, this particular moment, I would never be able to explain it, to anyone. Everything I could say is not close to what I remember, and what I remember is not even close to how I lived it. If you ever try something like LSD or shrooms, you'll understand it.    H+5 -> H+ sleep. Then we decided to eat a pizza, and go to sleep. It took me time to finally sleep, and before I stayed in the bed, just thinking. With my buddy-balloon, of course.    A psychedelic experience really change your life. It's not necessarily a big life change, like you decide to move out, convert yourself to a new religion, change your job and your way of life after your first trip, but the things you live, you feel, you think about, it get stuck in your mind forever.    A bit of a nerdy talk: the way our brain works is ""determined"", meaning that there are like ""circuits"" between neurons, pre-determined structures, algorithms our brain use all the time. If we look at the hardware of our brain, we (almost)always thinks the same way, using the same neurons, the same algorithms, because experience, learning and maturing shows that these particular ways, algorithms are efficients in cost of time and energy, so our brain likes them. But when we take psychedelic drugs, these algorithms literally breaks, meaning that it have to find new ways, new ""tools"" to think. Of course, after the trip, when you're ""back to normal"", your brain is fully functionnal, and it completely recovers, but that's why when on such drugs you feel differently, you think differently, you live differently, and all of this print a new strong experience in your mind.    If you're not afraid, and if you now what you're doing, it's a wonderful experience to live."
ENFP,3c5n0l,Lumenis,4,Sun Jul 5 11:15:32 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I took acid at a party with a friend of mine. We left before it kicked in and went to his house. Had a great time doing it. We put on dark side of the moon album, or more specifically, just that single song, on repeat, for 4 hours. Didn't notice the entire time it was the same song. He has a poster of Einstein riding a bike and sat and watched Albert ride his bike for a while. I felt every ounce of pleasure and joy he felt while riding it.   At one point we went off and had our own time. It was at this time that I astral projected and went and visited my girlfriend in her dreams. I had a conversation with a spirit being that I honestly can't even begin to explain but we both understood each other and it had a very profound impact on my life.  After that, my friend and I talked some more but it was solely through telepathy. And this conversation lasted through 3 bong bowls and about 7 cigarettes. Never physically said a word but we definitely talked.   Overall, it has always been my favorite drug. I smoke a lot of weed, but true psychedelics make me and my soul happy and free. It's been a long time since I've seen any pure LSD because everyone is trying to push research chemicals off as ""acid"" but it's just not the same. Mushrooms are also great but I can usually only find them when they're in season."
ENFP,3c5n0l,batmanisfiya,-1,Sun Jul 5 12:23:08 2015 UTC,That sounds more like a DMT trip than an acid tripp. Or you're making it up for karma from people who've never actually done it or talked face to face with someone who has.
ENFP,3c5n0l,FuckBigots4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:52:03 2015 UTC,Trust me it was LSD. I could give a shit about karma I just wanted to share my experience. I've done DMT and it was even more intense than LSD. Just because people experience very different things and you didn't experience what I did I'm making it up eh?
ENFP,3c5n0l,batmanisfiya,0,Sun Jul 5 12:23:38 2015 UTC,Drug trips are all different. But the way you tripp has a rough set of characteristics. Talking to god or higher beings is usually a DMT thing.
ENFP,3c5n0l,FuckBigots4,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:13:59 2015 UTC,I'm aware they are all different. The key word there is usually. Nobody experiences the same thing as anyone else. I know what DMT generally does. I've taken them both. DMT for me is just a more intense acid trip. I use LSD as a mind and soul expanding tool and use DMT for much the same. Though I can't take DMT near as often as LSD.
ENFP,3c5n0l,batmanisfiya,2,Sun Jul 5 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely love LSD. I plan on getting some soon actually. I just love the connectedness that it shows us and the beauty that we miss out daily. It's a perspective changer, and it's a very emotional feeling experience for me. Definitely appreciate that journey sense too. I feel like LSD is a drug suited especially for ENFPs."
ENFP,3c5n0l,VolatileLemons,2,Sun Jul 5 15:31:32 2015 UTC,"I just did it for the first time this weekend (yay!) and I honestly don't know why I haven't tried it sooner.   I was camping out in the woods with some really close friends and just had the most amazing time. Not only am I perceiving things in a new, more positive way, but I feel so much more connected to the earth in a way I can't really describe. Like I've done mushrooms before, but it hasn't even come close to the level of connectivity I had to nature and the people I was with this time around.   Kind of a generic response, but I can't wait to do it again!"

I see threads like this fairly often, but I'm really surprised that ENFPs don't have their Fi/Te combo go off before doing drugs..."
ENFP,3c5n0l,Draco309,6,Wed Jul 8 00:18:59 2015 UTC,"Up until the last few weeks of high school, I was strongly STRONGLY opposed not only to the idea of me taking drugs AND drinking, but also opposed to other people using and drinking.  I started drinking in moderation, but due to a genetic allergy to alcohol, I drifted towards weed because it gave me that same sense of contentment and relaxation on a night out or at a party.  When I realized that smoking a little weed could leave me waking up the next day feeling fine and able to carry on with my life, despite what my teachers and mom had told me about the herb, I began to wonder if there was anything else out there that I wanted to experiment with.  And that, to me, is what lies at the core of my personality.  To experiment, to push the boundaries, to pioneer a new way of thinking and being and to quench the thirst for adventure that burns in my heart.  But I always started small and only after doing a significant amount of research into every drug I tried.  My experimentation with all drugs (but for the very rare use of LSD) is over with no intention of turning back to that lifestyle.  As for whether or not they are wrong?  A drug is just a substance.  It's the way they are taken, the intention behind the act of ingestion and one's own set of values that determine whether drug use is wrong.  For me, I believe that if a drug is taken responsibly and with pure intention, and especially in such a way that the intoxicated individual remains respectful and peaceful and full of love, then whether it is ""right"" or ""wrong"" isn't relevant, it simply is."

He has asked and pleaded with me to drop acid with him, I refused.  When he pressed me for why, the only reason I would give him was simply ""I don't want to."" which he tried to argue against but without much success so he continued to press for the 'reason' why i didn't want to. I didn't give him one for two reasons.    If I had he would just make a logical argument for why that reason was invalid I didn't have one. I simple just don't want to."

ENFP,3c5n0l,FuckBigots4,4,Sun Jul 5 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe now that you're more mature mentally, you should give it another try. It really is not very fucked up at all if you go into it with the right mindset and good intentions. If you're worried about a ""bad trip"", just realize that the only person that can really affect that is you. I have to mentally prepare myself a few days prior because it is very intense. But as a tool to expand your conscious and explore your subconscious, it is second to none."
ENFP,3c5n0l,batmanisfiya,-3,Sun Jul 5 04:16:03 2015 UTC,"No, its just not a good idea.

ENFP,3c5n0l,FuckBigots4,3,Sun Jul 5 06:59:49 2015 UTC,I retract my statement for earlier. You clearly are not mentally mature enough to take LSD. The two are very very very very different. LSD changes the chemicals in your brain and allows you to do this. You shouldn't let one persons experience when they were younger completely turn you off of something that is positively life changing. But I'd grow up mentally a lot more before you try it.
ENFP,3c5n0l,batmanisfiya,0,Sun Jul 5 12:12:15 2015 UTC,You're way to easily offended.
ENFP,3c5n0l,FuckBigots4,3,Sun Jul 5 15:17:44 2015 UTC,It's just frustrating that you've never taken it and are basing your own experience on someone else's bad experience. LSD is quite healthy for the brain from my own research. It's quite a good idea if you're mature enough to do it but you just don't seem to be at that level. I'm not offended whatsoever. Just disappointed at your own forced ignorance.
ENFP,3c5n0l,batmanisfiya,-1,Sun Jul 5 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"Your ""own personal research"" I find it frustrating when someone acts like regularly tripping and having the field of science still be open on the subject is enough to justify being a self righteous jackass. Or like its completely rational to sit there and talk down to me like I'm ""immature"" just because after hearing a good set of evidence that its not the perfectly healthiest thing to do and after watching Seven people sit around trip balls and act like they're some deep godly motherfuckers just because they can see a shiny couch I've decided against it. I regret posting here in the first place. But holy shit you're a narcissist if you think taking drugs makes you an inherently better person, when at best its done litterally nothing to your personality or physical body what-so-ever.  Edit name me one thing you've learned from acid that has actually been enough to change your view of the world."
ENFP,3c5n0l,FuckBigots4,2,Sun Jul 5 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify before you make more assumptions here, I've tripped 5 times in my life. Not regularly. They have all been spaced out at the minimum 6 months from each other. Who told you it wasn't a healthy thing to do? Scientists who do research LSD say that there is nothing harmful that can come from it. It's not an act. I know you may not understand this because a lot of people don't, but the brain has a frequency and when you take LSD, your frequency increases and makes you more enlightened to the physical and metaphysical world. A shiny couch? What? I'm not sure how that makes me a narcissist? Well LSD does in fact rewire your brain a little and make it work somewhat better. You've never experienced an ego death because that most certainly changes your personality very very noticeably.   Well, acid taught me how to deal with my anger. I had previously gone to 3 or 4 therapists to help with my anger issues and they couldn't help. After I took it, I realized that the only person my anger hurts is myself. I stopped fist fighting, I stopped putting holes in walls, and I sincerely apologized to my parents and family and all the people that I had hurt because of my anger. I've learned that love and compassion are the way to inner and outer peace. It taught me to look outside of my own realm of vision and I developed a much larger sense of empathy than I had previously. Hell it developed so fast while I was tripping that I am now an empath. I feel and experience other peoples emotions in every setting."
ENFP,3c5n0l,batmanisfiya,-1,Sun Jul 5 16:42:52 2015 UTC,If I were you I'd take more of it then because you seem pretty irrationally angry to me. Never said it wasn't. I said the field of science was pretty undecided about it remember?   Judging by your post history you haven't made much progress. I didn't even realize you were the same person I commented on about the DMT like acid trip.  are you sure it's helping you?

Spent the rest of the night and morning together though, and can honestly say my heart ache is recovering splendidly.

Wednesday night - drove to Milwaukee, saw the Apache Relay, a little bit of Delta Spirit and Brand New (which has been my favorite band since I was thirteen, I have a tattoo as a tribute to them, and it was my FIRST TIME SEEING THEM!)  Thursday my boyfriend and I drove home and bummed around all day and ordered burritos and I got really mad about an episode of Lost and kind of went on a tirade about Deus ex machina for like 30 minutes.  Friday my boyfriend and I went to Macy's to get pretty clothes for a wedding next weekend and that was super fun, weirdly. Then I went out for my last hurrah with coworkers but they were lame and didn't want to stay out. So I met up with my bf at a bar near my house and we played darts and pool and got really drunk. And he said he loved me for the first time! About fucking time. And squee!  Saturday my boyfriend's friend came up from Illinois and we day drank allllll day and then went to a dive bar and drank some more. I really like this friend. He's a financial advisor and I like him enough to give him control of my money at this point, and that's saying something. But him and I get on like gangbusters, so it was a blast.  This morning we brunched and I just vegged the fuck out. I'm starting my new job at a startup tomorrow and I'm... anxious, to say the least. So the adventures for next week: new job, getting a tattoo tomorrow (maaaybe... I haven't fully decided yet), and then that wedding! So everything's coming up Jeska."
ENFP,3c52j7,the_luc,5,Sat Jul 4 21:30:09 2015 UTC,"OK, this is hauntingly familiar. I actually found myself to be an ENFP instead of an ENTP under similar circumstances. (Please pardon the wall of text.)  I mean, it's always a close call when it comes to ENxPs. It's confusing because we share Ne and our thinking and feeling functions are really close. Even more so, when we factor in gender. It's confusing to be an ENFP male if you're raised in an environment that fosters Te development over Fi development. By the time I reached Senior Year of high school, the idea of being a feeler felt like an absolute joke. You could even say my Te almost took the control panel away from Ne permanently.   I think it boils down though to which functions you identify most with. I see you've been reading up on the functions already, but I ask you to explore Fe: extraverted feeling. Possibly your 3rd function which might be developing as you've mentioned feeling ""so strongly on weird F things lately.""  Dom-tert loops tend to be quite destructive for self-development. An ENFP relying too much on their Ne and Te is bound to put themselves in the wrong places. He or she would simply dream or sketch up scenarios or plans and ruthlessly follow them, then get bored and move on like nothing even happened. It sounds nice, but it isn't. Imagine being able to move mountains and accomplish things without the gratification of truly wanting those achievements for yourself. Imagine being a soulless machine toiling away at things it could care less about if it could care at all. Add on the desire for total control and order conflicting with the interest of exploration and creativity. It's not fun. Ne-Te loopers are a lot like Micheal Scott from The Office. They do inane things to showcase their both their abilities or talents without introspection which leads to silly or sometimes harmful behaviors.  The minute I entered college and was immersed in a completely new environment, I had a breakdown. I couldn't ""game the system"" anymore. I knew no one. I had no one to ""impress."" I had no passion while everyone around me had someone or something to be sincerely passionate about.   I literally became a hermit for a bit. Started crying again. Started feeling again. Watched a crapload of movies. Sometimes I'd forget about school happening. It was annoying. I stopped being so rigid about life and started to let my Ne and my Fi breathe a little bit. I found a hobby, no like 3 or 4 that I'd always wanted to pursue but never did because it wasn't ""part of the mission."" One of them has led me to an interesting path in life I previously deemed too stupid to follow yet it's something I'm actually passionate about and willing to ""throw my life away"" for.  But enough about me. Ask yourself how you perceive the world. Do you have innate and potentially controversial values and tendencies that aren't proven? Do you cling to things despite potential public disfavor? Are your opinions and values somewhat set in stone unless something truly powerful rocks them? Fi is all about that jazz. It's why the ISFPs are called the ""Artists"" and INFPs are called the ""dreamers."" It has this unique, personal touch to it that Fe users can't really ""get"" sometimes.  Should you decide you're an ENFP, it's a weird journey rediscovering your Fi. It just happens out of nowhere. You start question what you stand for. It WILL get in the way of things if you let it. Just don't be afraid to believe in something wholeheartedly for yourself, not for your parents or your friends or anyone else. Just you.   Tl;dr Think about whether or not you use Fe or Fi. Don't look solely into Ti and Te. Ti users can also dam their Fe away too. Fi is messy, like really messy. I write way too much, but I did so because IDK I saw part of myself in this. I don't know how to end this."

Only in the last... year or so have I opened up and truly considered myself and my authenticity and deciding whether at the end of my life when I look back will I be more proud of how strong my walls were and how much I stuffed down and how indestructible I looked on the outside, or would I instead be more content knowing I lived an authentic life and actually felt the emotions I was intended to?

My siblings never believe me when I say they have it easy. (THEY DO.)  I so relate to growing up a calloused robot. My parents (an ENFJ and an ISTJ) find talking to me about things like love and affection so awkward because they think I think about from a mechanical standpoint (it's anthropological, guys!)

My mother is and always has been a sickly woman, mostly residing alone in her room and only calling when she needs something, though has a pretty big Fe leak going on and has never done well managing her own feelings, even going so far as to tell her children some of the awful things that happened to her in her past, something that 7-10 year olds should never hear. All around the time my parents are getting separated (they got back together 2 years later). It was a hard time for me and my brother and I had to be strong but I also was super desperate for attention and the main way I got it was by achieving and being the best so people would like me. My poor little brother was kind of the opposite and just kind of wobbled around and did his own thing and didn't care about acceptance or achievement and had no ambition and I was always so jealous of the attention he got because I felt it was undeserved because he did nothing to earn it and so I was a real jerk to him when we were children. I grew to hate sentimental things, I never say I love you to anyone, don't like physical affection, of outward displays of emotion... things mostly associated with F's. I adopted the NT lifestyle I saw in my friends and mentors during adolescence, and until recently never looked back. It gave me identity, to be an intellectual... A deep thinker, someone who loves logic and reason. But inside I feel a strong connection to F-ish traits, if only I was brave enough to ""be myself."" I wonder how much my childhood affected me and how much my innate personality is intact. What would I be if I hadn't been raised in such a way? It's always something interesting (though futile) to consider.   Thank you for sharing your story with me too.

Pharm school was kind of tough and not necessarily because of the material being hard but because of the personality types I met that were not very compatible to mine. Throughout school, I didn't know if I wanted to do it. In retrospect, I think nursing might have been a better field for me.  A lot of people who do pharmacy are really in it because they like the career and stability/money: a lot of people told me they like knowing what they'll expect when they come into work everyday and ofc, making bucks lol.   In addition, learning about drugs is just...I don't know. Too specific. Too much memorization. Not enough visualization. I'm good at biology and pharmacology, it's interesting to learn how the drug mimics functions in the body to work. But in practice, what you need to know are drug names (brand/generic), doses, side-effects, drug-interactions, etc. A lot of this is memorization that starts to stick after you practice long enough.   What I'm more interested in is knowing the body functions and how the disease affects the body. I'm interested in how diseases affect certain populations more than others (public health). I'm interested in knowing how infections spread and what kind of an impact that can have for society. Big picture thinking, harder science/biology implication, etc.  In addition, the people, from my peers to professors all used to act way too arrogant sometimes. I felt disappointed about some of the things I heard from a field in a health professions.  The reason I went in was because of clinical pharmacy, which I assumed would be a role that is in actuality more reserved to nurses.   Not to diminish the importance of pharmacy. It's a great profession that serves an important role in society. But no matter how good the benefits are, it's not a field for everybody; certainly looks like some personality types will fare better than ENFPs.

Your ""do my own thing time"" might be talking to all the friends that your partner finds exhausting, trying new hobbies in meet up groups, etc. Embrace having that opportunity. The alternative is suffocating while your social network withers.  Now, if you've got a jealous partner that doesn't want you going out, that's a different story. But if you find the one who respects your type of ""me time"" while you can respect theirs, you're golden.  TL;DR: Social butterflies need a lot of flowers to feed from. Grow your garden!"

ENFP,3c1g0q,playfultouch,9,Fri Jul 3 21:53:25 2015 UTC,"Ok so I'm an old fart, so I have a bit of perspective on this.   Firstly, it is very common to move away from friends who have at high achool and Uni ? Why ? Because between the ages of 18 and 26 you will change more than at any other time in your life (This is also why its a bad idea to get married too early)  Secondly, true friends never fade :) I have half a dozen or so friends from Uni that I atill have two decades later. Despite looooong stretches of not being in contact due to living overseas / chronic illness / having children / full-on careers etc we are always delighted to see each other and pick up where we left off seamlessly, while our pretty children play together :)  Thirdly: as an ENFP, as you get older your bullshit detector gets better and you start learning how to conserve your emotional powers for people who deserve it, rather than any random who crosses your path.. This may mean losing people who were using you as an emotional punching bag, or who take and take but never give anything back. This is a good thing :)  LastY, the friends I have made in the last ten years or so ie: in my thirties and forties have been much, much closer and better friends - simply because I am more picky about who I give my time to, and who I open up to; because I have much less spare time and energy !! People have to be really special for me to give up my precious Saturday afternoons or pay a babysitter $100 to spend my evenings with them :)   I have always been an ""absence makes the heart grow forgetful"" sort of person :) but it means that those friendships that I am able to reconnect with easily, or those new ones that I make, are all the sweeter for it."

ENFP,3c1g0q,stoicblunder,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, 100%. For me, this as gotten a lot more pronounced as I get older. I am in my early 30s now, and I am starting to write off people for the first time in my life. I mean I moved a lot and set up new social circles all the time, but I always felt guilty about not seeing old friends or staying in contact. Well, I just moved again, and I don't feel at all bad leaving behind a lot of ""friends"" who were really just acquaintances who liked being around me.  One thing to think about with friendships is how much you are giving and how much you are getting. ENFPs give too much to an extreme. People latch on like emotional leeches and will drain you dry if you are not careful. I know this from first hand experience. I have to keep a Great Wall of China between me and other people emotionally or I will just gush out all of myself to them. When this happens, and I don't get the same amount back, that is when I dont want to see the person again. it feels embarrassing, and i feel sorta used. It happened a lot.  Don't feel bad about it, accept what you feel and move on. You are gonna hurt people no matter what you do in this life. The worst thing you could do is deny how you feel and then you stagnant. Been there done that, worst thing ever."

And see what he does about it. It's a vulnerable thing to do and ask, but opening up might get a proper response. It's a conversation starter, and I think you two need to have a conversation. From that point, you might be able to communicate your needs, and the relationship might be able to bounce back. That what it sounds like though:  he's not meeting your needs, for whatever reason. Is it lack of physical touch? Is it that you need more quality time? Do you want him to put more work into the relationship, do work to show that he loves you? Do you need to be verbally reaffirmed that he cares? Is he interrupting what you say, or not valuing some things you say? Is there a reason behind the fights? Or have your values drifted apart from each other?   Also keep in mind that you might not be meeting his needs for whatever reason. Be open to understanding that too.   If you want it to just be done and over, and it helps you heal more quickly, you can just end the relationship cleanly and swiftly. It would be kind of you to talk with him explain why it went wrong, so that he doesn't have to wonder why your decision went the way it did. Have a meaningful breakup, and then remove him from your life as much as you can.You obviously care for this person, so this breakup will hurt. But it will hurt more to drag it on without addressing the issues.   It's still up to you to pick and decide, but give yourself control over this. If he cares about you, he should be concerned about you being sad."

And he, having the wonderful INFJ traits he does, listened and opened up. We had a really great talk, and realized we were both feeling the same way, and that what we ultimately wanted was to fix it.   Instead of bringing up issues we decided that to move forward we had to come up with ways to both meet the other one's needs. A lot of it was small stuff that tends to become big stuff, and we explained to each other why each need was important. We both walked away with a better understanding of the other, and I feel like we're getting our connection back.   We're a team again, guys!   And I want to thank you for being my ENFP team.

ENFP,3bxirv,burrit0z,2,Sun Jul 5 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"I've gone through it. It was extremely hard to realize at first, but once I realized it, I just broke up with him without thinking twice. Because I felt like I owed him at least that. I didn't want to keep dragging it out and making us both miserable. Breaking up with him was so difficult and there were moments when I wanted to just say ""Okay okay! Nevermind! I can't do it,"" but I knew our relationship would just revert to how it had been for so long.  I think that resent is the major thing that tears relationships apart, and when you have the same fights over and over you build up so much awful resent. Sometimes it's almost impossible to bounce back from that because you don't just forget all the fights you once had. You don't just forget feeling like the other person was selfish or unreasonable or careless. You now know that those are things they are capable of being toward you.  I think the fact that you have lived together for a while is what would make it more complicated from my perspective. I don't know what all you have attempted so far, but maybe tell him exactly what you have told us. Tell him that's how you feel, that's not how you want to feel, and that at this point it's a last ditch effort. Maybe from there you can figure out if you need to part ways or if he has thoughts on making it work.  I hope that didn't all sound too cynical or pessimistic. I personally have had relationships fall apart from this type of low point, but I have also had one entirely bounce back from an all time low and it's the best relationship I've had (still in it and no regrets). I don't think until you are both 100% honest about your perspective on the relationship, that you can know exactly where to go from here.  Good luck and we are always here if you need us <3"

Slightly longer version: You're going to obsess over it and becuase you started off this way it's always going to be like that until your opinion of her changes. In that case you probably won't feel the same way anymore. Also the more you communicate the easier it gets but of course you're not nearly as communicating as much as you should or you wouldn't have posted this.  Solution: Just talk to her and do something.

Eventually you can lead to, ""Wanna hang out sometime?"" Or ""Wanna (insert whatever you want here)"".   All it takes is communication, which we just so happen to be good at. It's funny, the relationship I'm in now and have been in for two and a half years started with my girlfriend and I just talking, with no intention of starting a romantic relationship.   Don't do nothing. You need to talk to her.  Just make sure you don't overthink it as you do it, and don't drag out some long explanation like we happen to do so often. Keep it short and sweet.

Most of my introverted boyfriends, in the earlier stages of our relationship, tended to be really guarded, and being part of the great ENFP cluster, they slowly/quickly started to be more open which is when you know they're actually comfortable with you!   I would stray away from wanting to show your deep side instantly, I feel like this can come off as a bit disingenuous, like you're assuming that's the type of person she likes just because she's quiet introvert or something at least that's what I took it as.. sorry if that wasn't your intention!

ENFP,3bywsg,AnotherENFP,2,Fri Jul 3 07:42:57 2015 UTC,"I have been on Citalopram since last november. I didn't really feel much of a difference, but keep in mind that it gradually starts working. This basically means that the difference from day 14 to day 15 is really not noticeable, but from day 1 to day 30 there is a noticeable difference. However this makes it easy to think it doesn't work on you, but please give it an honest attempt.   I don't know your situation, but my anxiety/depression was not discovered until last fall when I was 21, and I am pretty sure it went back all the way to when I started upper secondary when I was 15 (a conservative guess). My issue was mainly that I had shut down my ability to feel as a bad coping mechanism for what bothered me, which led to apathy, shame and even more anxiety.  What I've learned though is this; take it in the morning or you will not sleep. Suddenly stopping the pills just to make a change in your life is not a good strategy (happened one day I was desperate for change and just said fuck it). It can make you do or say stuff you can't take back. My sex drive was basically non existent (thought I was asexual for a year or two) before the pills, and I do actually think it helped in that way. Weight I can't really chime in with much as my weight has never been stable. I did gain weight, but I was also an exchange student in the US where the cafeteria and everywhere else was packed with greasy delicious food that costs about half of what I'm used to back home.   I have actually stopped taking the pills now (this week), because they have the cool and rarely mentioned side effect of making MDMA completely useless, and I have aquired some for the purpose of getting a similar epiphany as the one I recently had after smoking too much pot which made my life make a lot more sense.  If you have any other questions or concerns please do ask. And just FYI I am a 21 year old male, if that matters at all."

ENFP,3bywsg,nohomoerectus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"Citalopram is in the SSRI class of drugs. Generally the affects come on slowly in about 6-8 weeks, but it's not uncommon for doctors to check in with patients earlier than that to see how things are going. It is effective in depression and anxiety, and is also used off label to provide some relief for nerve pain.  Most common side effects with SSRIs as a class is that patients get loose stools and stomach upset for about 2 weeks and then their body gets used to it. This is because serotonin works in the gut to make it more mobile.   Sexual side effects are also common, typically difficulty reaching orgasm. Because everyone is different, some people enjoy the extra time it takes, and other's can't stand it. So just watch out for it, and let your doctor know if it happens.   You will also hear about weight gain, but this is typically in the patients who had lost their appetite because of their depression. So they gain the weight when their appetite comes back.   If you ever decide to discontinue the drug, you should talk with your doctor about making a plan. Once you've taken if for a long while, you need to come off slowly. Coming off quickly often leaves people with headaches, which they have not so lovingly named ""brain zaps"". These headaches can stick around for weeks before they sort themselves out. People also experience anxiety and depression when they go off (no big surprise) too quickly, as well as stomach upset and bowel issues again. If you come down slowly, and make a plan with your doctor, all of this is way less likely to happen. Overall, the drug is considered quite safe.  Because every person is different in how they experience side effects and benefits, I think the only person that can say that it's worth it is the individual.

I'm prepared for the first few days or weeks to be kind of brutal, but I am optimistic regarding the long term. Yesterday I was feeling good for most of the day, than I started to get some chest pains (feels tighter, and cramped up in the middle of my chest). Was hard to sleep on my right side, however the pain is still bearable. Today still w/ the chest pains, but am now getting a sort of tingly feeling in my brain, with a bit of a feeling that I may throw up at some point.   For a lot of people I read that concentration and focus is affected negatively early on. Did you guys have that as well? And does it get better over time?  I'm a professional poker player, so it could hurt a bit if my focus/concentration takes a big hit.  Curious to some of the main things that change from negative to positive over the first month or so.   Thanks again for the responses :)  Also not sure how relevant, but im 23 male."

I have minor eye pain, and minor headache. My chest is still feeling a tight sharp pain at times, I cant sleep or lay on my left side.   I was prepared to possibly endure side effects for a while when starting this. I was wondering if any of these side effec ts should be worrying me though? The pain I don't care about (though its a bit of an annoyance), just want to make sure nothing drastic will come of these side effects."

You can think about whatever you want, whenever you want, without having to deal with any consequences. I don't want to know what other people think about, it's their own business. I don't want to know if this girl likes me or not, I want her to show me whether she does or not.    I love ideas. Actually, I consider them being one of the most important thing in the world, because it's powerful, and they never really die. But if nobody is here for the acting part, after the thinking stuff, the idea is worthless. Thinking without acting is as dumb as acting without thinking. If you can read people's mind, you remove the acting part. Of course they still can act, but there is no fun in knowing what they're going to do, there is no surprise, no secret, and I don't want to live in a world like that."

Ever since i was maybe 4 or 5 the smell takes me back to being in the main entrance with the warm sun beating down from the windows and the aroma cocooning me like a romantic perfume.

Check in with them and try to get them to do things, but make it easy to say no. Food is good. Building forts is good as they can stay home. Just, be prepared to listen, and when they're over the worst of it, be prepared for dealing with a stubborn mule. Honestly, just drop by their place after work and walk around the block with some candy or something.   Just try, but don't let your mood be affected by them too much. Laugh easily. Don't make them feel that by hanging out with you, they're sharing bad emotions.  Yeah... I'm going through a really rough episode but getting treatment helps and I've taken up jogging so I don't mind looking not my best in public, and I don't beat myself up for eating until I feel full, as I'm progressing slowly to something better.

ENFP,3bs37s,killerfox,3,Fri Jul 3 04:26:43 2015 UTC,"I went through this after a breakup at the end of last year. Had about 2 months of being reclusive. Just work, home, stay home. Disabled my Facebook account. One word replies with any messages. This was followed by finally going out for a NYE party and owning the night socially, but then about 2 more months of self-doubt, and not trusting others. March came along, and I came back strong, after having the chance to DJ the most famous club in Tokyo, and being a fucking star for that night until morning and the days to follow. The girls I met, the DJs I linked with, the friends I rekindled with, everything was looking up, and here it is July, and that momentum is going stronger.   So for me, it took about 5 months. Wow, looking back on it now, I can't believe how low I got. Over a girl!"
ENFP,3bs37s,killerfox,2,Sat Jul 4 00:08:07 2015 UTC,"Check in on them often. One of the most harmful effects of depression is the tendency to isolate oneself. This is because when somebody gets trapped in a negative thought spiral, everything will seem negative regardless of evidence to the contrary. This is how it goes for me:  I feel terrible even though it's within my power to change my situotion. -> Therefore I'm pathetic and not worthy of the love and attention of my friends/family. -> Therefore asking for help or reaching out would just be lowering them to my pathetic sad state.  From there, it just feeds into the isolation reinforcing the negative feedback loop. By reaching out to them, you are helping shatter these harmful views. It doesn't need to be super high interaction of ""cry your heart out in my arms"" every day. Just simple things that show that you are there for them, or remind them that life is not all shit, and this is just temporary can go a long long way.  Best of luck for you and your friend :)"

ENFP,3bs37s,rbrcbr,2,Thu Jul 2 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"It's hard because I'm always overwhelming ourselves with everything. Sometimes that gets to be too much and I become reclusive. When I'm in that state I dont really want to be be with anyone (I do, but I dont, but I do) the only people I wanna chill with are my closest friends and all I really want is to do nothing with them.   Random outbursts of thoughts that I dont know how to process come out sometimes and it's nice having someone that I trust there with me to bounce feelings off of and confirm that I'm am not a crazy person.   The best thing you can do is: Ask them if they want you to hangout. If they dont then give them space. If they do then just BE there with them. Dont try to sort things out or pressure them to talk about whats bothering them. You can rest assured they're already thinking about everything at once. Just chill with them, let them know you care and are there for them, cuddles and hugs help a lot too. For me this happens 1-3 times a year. The darkness can last from a day to a couple weeks but you just have to remember that it WILL pass and reassure them that they are feeling this way because they care TOO much and that this fleeting, frustration, anger and sadness will morph back into happiness as soon as they have something new to distract them.   I know this may not apply to everyone (or to people with chronic depression ect.) but for me personally thats what happens and thats how I would try to help someone else like me."

It's best to use it as a guide of how someone is likely to perceive, and judge the world around them, there are countless other factors which contribute towards a person's attitudes or actions. Rather than thinking about which one is ""better"" than the other, I think it's more useful to understand the strengths and weaknesses that a personality type is likely to encounter.  For INxJ, our Dominant Ni fosters lots of deep introspective musings, generally driving us to understand abstract systems, and what makes them tick. This makes us fantastic problem solvers and fixers. INTJs for mechanic and logic systems (physics, computer science, finance, etc...), and INFJs for organic and social systems (social equality, spirituality, diplomacy, etc...). The flip side, is that we can get lost in our idealistic visions, and need to reconcile the difference between what could be and what is."

ENFP,3bqure,_bonafide,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yeahh, depression is pretty terrible. It leeches from you and feeds itself on it.  That being said, it is far from invincible and can be fought back ironically very simply; doing something. It kinda sounds almost so simple that I'm be sarcastic, but that's, at least to me, one of the best and closest to immediate ways to deal with it. I've been grappling with it for about two years and therapy definitely does help, it's wonderful. The thing is, you can't be at your therapist every day.  Soo, find something to do. Find a hobby. Preferably something productive, because I've been turning to video games. While they help, I'm kinda lonely and haven't done anything with myself at the end of the day. I've just recently taken up writing lyrics and music, since I'm a pretty good poet and have a knack for music anyways. Singing gets a lot of emotions out that I can't really feel experience in the first place and release in the, uh, second place.  If there's something like that for you, try dedicating some time to it. And if there isn't, think or search for one. There's something for everyone somewhere. Within some reasonable degree of reach. It might not be easy to find, but it exists, and anyone can do it.   Two other notes:  One, if how you're feeling right now is more of an emotional angry and sad type of low, you're definitely going to be okay. That is, with rare exception, recoverable on your own with a little guidance from some personal morals and perhaps a special person or two. If you find it's instead a type of apathy towards everything and you quite literally care so seldom you don't notice it or not at all about anything, you're going to want to seek professional help as soon as possible. That's from what I understand the last step before, yknow.  Second, I wouldn't worry a whole lot about people being negligent. They don't quite understand what's going on; not the severity. Only people who have learned about it in personal time or have gone through it really, really get it. And those people would do something. Try not to feel as betrayed and downtrodden you are about it, because it's something that's beyond your control, and really has just got to be accepted and moved on from. Dwelling on it won't change those people to suddenly understand and listen. Maybe one day you'll find someone or some people who can. It's possible.  Stick it through buddy, you can do it."

Basically, I recently went through a LOT and my year long ""loving"" relationship ended because he walked away when I needed someone most and the only person I have left is my mum, which is why I relate a lot to feeling bitter and angry.  Sometimes I think it's okay to give up for a little while. Being extroverted is one thing, but we're all a little introverted, too. Fucking sleep the day away. Sometimes I do that. It's easier than thinking. At least when you wake up, you feel well rested.  Write, listen to music, draw shitty scribbles and words and song lyrics, paint; do anything even semi-creative to let it out because if no one will listen, you've got to do something."
ENFP,3bqure,cat-c,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"How have your parents reacted to getting you therapy? Under the recent health care act (from my understanding and experience) insurance companies have to treat mental health in the same way they treat physical health. I would look into it or have your parents or a friend do it for you. If you are still in high school, during lunch or after school you could talk to a guidance counselor who could give you free. If you're in college, there should be a counseling place you can go to. If there's not (or if it costs more money than you can pay) contact a psychology professor. Please please PLEASE keep us all updated!! You should make some short term goals. Like that you will update us every two days or something."
ENFP,3bqure,SeductivePillowcase,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"First, I'd like to congratulate you on taking the first step to personal wellness by opening up your emotions. Money is replaceable. You are not. A college education will always be there. You can always get the books, or attend the class and get a degree and none of that will ever show up on a record if you don't do it in a certain timespan. But you can't always get an opportunity to make things better for yourself, so whatever the cost of you getting help, is worth each penny.   But what you said isn't true. People do care. Look at all the rest of the comments people have left as evidence. We care for you, and we want to see you well, because many of us understand and have gone through similar experiences. Honestly, I've been in and out of depression and had fits of rage and days where I feel like I have to distance myself from everyone because I'm a ticking hydrogen bomb waiting to explode on those who tread near me. But honestly, I'm glad I had those experiences. I'm glad I've been broken and cast out of the Eden of my own mind, because these experiences helped and allowed me to better understand other people going through the same things and avert my judgment from their weary minds.   We are far from invincible. We have steal bodies with glass hearts, and if those break, it's over. The wall we make to dispel evil will also keep good away. While it is true that there are people who are careless and have absolutely no interest in other people but themselves (I've been one of those people), there are also other people who do care a lot about you and your well being. And it may surprise you when you discover who that may be. It could be a stranger or even a minor friend that's not in your inner network. I've been shocked to be so humbled by people whom I thought were incapable of taking care of themselves providing me with the best care and support I've ever received. The ego is a strange thing in that respect. It may surprise you to learn who might be willing to help, someone you probably never imagined, but you will not know who these people are unless you make yourself vulnerable.  It sucks trying to trust people when you feel this way. I haven't been suicidal in years, but I have frequent intrusive thoughts of cutting off contact from all my friends and killing all my friendships. But that depression is a fucking liar. It will twist everything beautiful into something ugly and nasty. Your friends are there, and if not, you have us. Please be safe, and get the best help you need!"

You can consider making a few calls to therapists - often they'll offer a sliding scale fee, or maybe even a first short consultation free. Or ask them what resources they could recommend which may be more affordable. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with, and be honest with them.   We care. Now please go make that call and find a therapist to talk to."
ENFP,3bqure,AnachronisticError,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:42:57 2015 UTC,"I feel as though greeting you would mean that you said nothing of any importance at all. So I will not say hello.  I'm just a fellow person extending their hand to help you, but before you try to grab my hand in approval of this action I'd like to point out some things.  What you're going through is definitely hard but it's of a most necessary cause and it is for self-development. Yes that's right, you're going through a phase in which your final decision will definitely affect, if not entirely than partly, your life. That is, at least what I define the act of evolving. I do not know if what I'm about to write is of any help, after all I've only just begun, but I need you to read this with a clear mind. Try to put your emotions and all the pain you have on the side and open your eyes, the eyes of which have witnessed a part of this life's harshness. Open them.  You say you move around a lot? Well I do as well and one thing I've learnt from moving around is that you can only rely on yourself and that in this beautiful but harsh life you only have yourself and your road. People will come and go on your path but everyone has their own. People will help you but they will leave you in the end.   Doesn't it sound cruel? Well it is, to believe that in this very world that you and I live in there will be no one to help you but yourself. But here's the thing, all this time you're the one who truly helped yourself. People don't grab your legs and put them in a position that'll enable you to walk on. That's not what people do. They just push you a little to get you up, they just remind you of the road ahead of you. Although it's very helpful to hear such reminders in times of need, eventually you'll fall hard and reminders will not be sufficient to keep you moving. Everything people say to help you will sound overused and in some way… fake. Of course this can be the case or maybe just your depressive thoughts taking over.  Regardless, you will be there on your road sitting down lost and empty thinking of quitting this road and even life.  'Alright so people are all selfish, no one will help me, I am an ugly mess and I am falling.'  But this is just a phase that'll pass if you allow it to. If it does you'll be much stronger and it'll never happen again because you've truly gotten over it. Once it passes what will remain of it is not the feeling itself, that will fade within time, but what that feeling felt like, in this case ""awful"".  And many things are awful, like a ripped dictionary for instance, or black licorice or even vegemite. So it'll just be a tag for that time.   And if you remain there on your ground…… well you will remain. Nothing will happen but the so on depression.  So the question is how do you get up?  Well believe it or not I was in a somewhat similar phase to yours (emotionally) a few months ago. I not only lost hope but interest in the people and things around me, I felt discouraged to do even the simplest tasks, I couldn't even keep focus everything seemed so boring and I thought ""What the heck is the point?"" whenever I tried to engage in any activity. I can't say for sure if I've fully recovered but I definitely feel a lot better.  What made me get up and hit for the road again? I suppose the first thing that got me trying to 'shoot for the stars' again (seems a little too energetic for an INTJ heh?) was my self-acknowledgment of the situation I was in, that I was depressed and that I needed help, I accepted that and it's reason of being. The second step was to tell myself that I needed to suck it up and get up from this misery I was in. That was the hardest step… It definitely took time. Sometimes, I found myself crying with frustration and asking myself ""Since I know that I'm in a problem and that I need to fix it why the heck don’t I just get it over with?"". I passed this step after understanding that I was all alone when it came to this problem; no one would be able to fix the problem but me. It was my problem and I had to fix it on my own, not even my loved ones would be able to help me. What motivated me to do this was my want to get back to my stable self. The third step, this was associated with the second, and that was to constantly remind myself that what will remain of the difficulties I've been going through will only be a memory of what it was like.  You seem to know your situation very well and you seem to believe that you're in need of help, accept that (as in do not belittle yourself and do not be ashamed of yourself for it) and that'll be the first step for you.   This world has its ups and downs but remember that: The world is not beautiful: therefore it is.  So here's a pat on the back, go listen to some lovely music, have a cup of tea, take a walk outside, read a good book, have a hot bath, learn some dance moves, draw or do some meditating. There are, I assure you, many small but beautiful things this life has to offer.  You say you're a good person well I wouldn't want a good person to go to waste because he/she wasn't able to solve a certain predicament.  Now, will you take my hand and get this over with? (I hope my message is not too late and that it has helped you)  Edit: I apologize for the terribly long message... I just noticed _'."

ENFP,3bqure,ThePwningCamel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:50:47 2015 UTC,"my feeling right now: (Copy + Pasted from reddit a while ago due to how close to me it was)  I hate everything. The system, the people, the fucking air. I don't know what i should do with my life, because i fear i will fail at the things i want to do. I want to travel the world, gather experience and meet actuall decent people, and then convey everything i experienced into novels, books, stories, whatever. I want to help change everything that is wrong about this world.  And the routine has become so ingrained that your personality just reeks of deadpan self-deprecation and stark observational humor that scrapes the barrel for shock value. I cringe at every joke about masturbation I make. I can't talk to girls because the second I make them laugh that's all I'm good for. They can't even tell I'm serious about anything even though my biggest fault is taking everything in my life, especially myself and the choices I have to make, I DREAD to make on a daily basis... too seriously. My self image is so fucked that I'm constantly riding the line of being better than everyone I meet and hating everything about myself, and striving towards a level of humbleness so extreme that I've learned to leave nothing of myself to appreciate: it's either expected and should receive no praise, is nowhere near perfect and should receive no praise, or is something I should really just be ashamed of. And all the while, I'm trying to make sense of the world and who I am as a person so I can stop wasting the time I've been given on this Earth and become the person I want to be..

ENFP,3blrqb,libelle156,2,Wed Jul 1 07:20:21 2015 UTC,"Pardon the clickbaity title, first off. Welcome to my rant. I'm pissed over this for a couple of reasons.  1: I live with severe clinical depression. Anybody who new me as a kid and even up to middle school (16 now) knows that I was a beaming ray of sunshine and picked up the mood of anybody simply by presence, and even more with behavior. Depression has stripped that from me. I battle with apathy daily and it restricts my ability to do anything. No emotion, no passion, no motivation, and I'm a kid with big dreams. But as it stands I can only go through basic daily motions and play some video games, and maybe have one spurt of okay I'm going to do something with myself and accomplish a little, little bit. It's terrible. Anybody dismissing the romanticization of mental illnesses or disagreeing with what that post is saying clearly does not actually have any, or does not understand what it means to have them.  2: 2 out of 3 of my closest friends have dealt with self harm in one way or another. I have been struggling to keep myself from it for a couple months. It is not beautiful. I have told one of them that they do not influence my opinion of her. I don't consider them. I don't want people to think that it can be done as a ploy for attention. For help? Yes, fine. I'd rather they go and get some help without slashing up their body with permanent wounds but I know how hard it is. Especially when you lean on the edge of caring so little that you actually can go and kill yourself. I was there. When you don't care to get help, somebody has to get it for you. Sometimes it takes seeing scars to get that done, as tragic as that is.  3: This person is not trying to be mean for fuck's sake. They are not being insulting. It's a reminder or a warning or whatever. I can't think of the word right now and that's pissing me off too. Insulting would be to tell someone their scars are disgusting, or because they're suicidal they might as well, since they're that fucked up anyways. This is just a wake-up call. To tell someone what they're going through needs to be addressed, because it is not healthy. God damnit, don't dismiss that! Please! It's so, so, so important! AHGRHAGRH  I guess I could go on, but I don't want to. It's bothering me so much that I need to get my mind off of it. Every single thing that person said is correct, and that one of my friends on Facebook would share someone ""k""ing it as well as someone even ""k""ing it at all is just ughh"
ENFP,3blrqb,albinochicken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:45:16 2015 UTC,"The world is full of vastly different people, and obviously they have different views on things. Some people are just jerks, and do things to get a reaction. A reaction like a really long three step rant. There's also people who would agree and sympathize with what you're saying. But there's more than just different people who feel differently about everything. People take information and feelings in different ways.   There are some people who think that's asking for attention. Or it's too much like a plea for being special. Whether it us or not, using bold and all caps to state things about personal struggles or touchy subjects is just way too in someone's face. It's over stimulating, and for some it can be annoying.   Now I know what that might sound like. ""WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME SELF HARM SHOULDNT BE ANNOYING TO ANYONE!"" And yeah, to an extent that could be correct. But to publish things like that in public for the intent of everyone to see and hear you is what could be annoying. The ""k."" That you got is clearly from someone who thinks you should get more personal help, or try and suck up the reality that some people don't give a fuck.   I really get what you're going through man. I've taken the Myers Briggs test and at first I was an ENFP. People called me irrational and that was a little annoying. Recently I've been feeling a lot more too myself and disliking large socials gatherings. I retook the test and got INXP.

I'm not saying that what you're doing is a bad thing, but if your arse starts bleeding / you start drinking / smoking weed / taking antidepressants to cope, its time to find a new job.  What will help is a time-delineated plan. So    I will do this job for two years or eighteen months At the end of two years I will have skill sets A and B I will apply for position C at Company D   or   I will start a business as a consultant in my field    or whatever the plan is.  Can I just add, from my own experience, that a well thought out plan, from my head, will be trumped by my emotions and spiritual needs every time.   You may well be more hard headed and have more gumption than me !! But I am working as hard as I ever was raising three boys and starting a business as a potter and I never feel stressed or unhappy about it. I always look forward to going to work. All the skills that I am learning now are applicable in my field and everything I learn makes me better at what I do  now.   It really fills my need for immediate feed-back and I love being in control of my own destiny.  One of the things I hated about working was that it didn't matter if I worked hard or not - I never got a pay rise or a promotion from it.  With what I do now, if I work hard I get more money :) and my kids do better at school and emotionally :)  I'm not saying quit your job and go get a position as a scuba diving instructor in the Maldives (although that's always a good back-up plan); but be very clear about what you're doing and where you're going and why you're doing it.  Also, try to pick up one fluffy hobby - dancing is a good one as its creative, physical and social. But something that you enjoy for you alone and prioritise it. And not something dull like going to the gym - something you love - if that's horseriding on a Sunday, or drawing lessons, or motocross or whatever. You need that reward and payoff for all your hard work on the job.  Because, in the end, if you're not working to have a happy life, then what the fuck are you working for ??"
ENFP,3bkjwd,Buddhamama42,2,Tue Jun 30 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. As ENFPs, ""stick-to-it-iveness"" is definitely challenging for us, especially in a job with menial and/or repetitive tasks. Even more if the outcome of the task is not guaranteed to be a reward or happy-thing.   I speak from experience in a laboratory, where I had design, build, and test cell constructs (I can tell you about that later if you want). Designing and building took about 2-3 days, and testing took 2-3 hours.  That damn test would fail at least 3 times out of 4, and it was frustrating as hell. Then I would report to my boss, who was micromanage-y and wanted to have meetings 3x/week, and he would say WELL IT FAILED OH  MY GOD and be kind of a drama queen, but it would make me feel really bad and extremely disheartened  I also worked long hours, but did not have a very generous salary. I am currently in the process of leaving :)  That Said   Why are you working long hours? Are you trying to meet a deadline? Will the long hours be over soon? Do you have any hobbies that you were able to work on before the long hours crap started?  Go see friends when you are off work. Go meet up with and laugh with people; while the outing is totally just a standard healing potion to your job's Final Boss, the social energy will keep you from completely losing hope.  Read a fun book on your lunch break. It's not as fantastic as people-energy, but it will get you through a hard day."

ENFP,3bkjwd,stoicblunder,0,Thu Jul 2 22:11:35 2015 UTC,"The process of creating yourself is often more negative than we like to imagine. It's like sculpting. To be a lawyer, for instance, you have to cut away the parts of yourself that aren't a lawyer.   The question is- are the parts of yourself that you're destroying worth it? Will you be able to regain them when you're done? If so, will you have the time and resources to regain what you lost?  Destroying yourself for a while can absolutely be worth it if the end you have in mind is truly a better version of yourself. Focus on the virtues you're building now, what are they? Endurance? Grit? Focus? Will? If you focus on the virtues, and not the tasks themselves, at the end of this period of work you'll be a stronger person. But if you just focus on the tasks, and how much of your personality you're losing, you'll end up with less.   It's possible that the work you're in and this kind of self-building are incompatible. But I suspect they're not. Try to use the forces that you're living under in order to propel yourself toward your goals."
ENFP,3bkv2d,enfpcocoa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:24:07 2015 UTC,"Being decent at math consists of two things:  1) Understanding the concept. The big picture. ENFPs are good at this. Get down to first principles and understand what it's trying to do, even if you don't know exactly how to do it yet.  2) Practise, practise and practise some more. There is no way around it. You simply have to drill yourself. Work on 10 of the same type of questions, even if it feels like you already know it. It might be boring, but there's always the thrill of puzzling out and getting the correct answer. Your goal is to see a question and instantly know what it's trying to ask for and how to solve it.  In terms of study strategies, find an environment that works for you. Some people work better in a cafe setting, some people need to be isolated. The point is to identify an environment that really jives with your studying, rather than choosing a place that you like to be in, but isn't necessarily conducive for you. You might think you like listening to music while studying, but it might just be a distraction.  Make a schedule and set aside a block of time to work. Even if it's just 45 minutes a day. Build up a habit. Be disciplined. Reward yourself after."

ENFP,3bjswo,DecadeGothic,2,Mon Jun 29 20:17:48 2015 UTC,"What do YOU want? Are you okay being in a relationship with someone who isn't fully committed to you?   Second - are you okay with all of this continuing? You have to be ready for that to continue if you want to stay in this relationship. It can be verrrry hard for people to change and grow, and this sounds like a complicated situation.   Looking at what your INFP needs -  The INFP needs to separate from the ex, as you know - it almost seems like he's addicted to her, and it's not healthy. Motivation to grow, change, and release himself from the ex will be important for the INFP. Ideally, this means no contact with the ex and professional help. I also wonder if he can effectively do that while also being in another relationship.   You probably won't be able to help him do that - it's not your role. If you feel that this is your responsibility to save him, that is a huge weight for you to bear, and you can't be that for him. He really needs professional help.   The real question is are you getting your needs met from this relationship? Is this what you want? What do you want??  It sounds like he is hurting you. I'm really sorry to read all of this. <3"
ENFP,3bjswo,infjtoday,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:41:32 2015 UTC,"Well first and foremost I want to be independent. I'm 22 and this is a pretty sensitive time for me and I want to develop a sense of self without a boy. THAT SAID, as someone who has been with an abusive person (emotionally), it pains me seeing him going back to his abuser. I want him to be happy and if this means confronting some of his demons so be it.  I don't feel like it's my responsibility to save him but I really think therapy would help. It just sucks being in such a powerless situation. I want to help him but he makes so many excuses for this girl and he won't listen to me when I say I'm concerned about his well being and I'm not really jealous of the girl. The whole situation is confusing but he has an amazing heart and I know we are best friends at this point.  Also thank you for such a thoughtful reply :-)"
ENFP,3bjswo,infjtoday,2,Tue Jun 30 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you want to maintain your independence and set some emotional boundaries for yourself here. Or at least that's what it seems like you may be trying to do.   Re therapy - if you haven't made this suggestion to him yet, is there a way you could do so?  I wish he would treat you better and at least listen.   Maybe distract yourself and go make some new friends while you maintain your friendship with him? Maybe this will get your mind off it a tiny bit, be fun for you, and give you new connections."
ENFP,3bjswo,infjtoday,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:35:06 2015 UTC,I'm trying to think of a way to tell him about therapy. I myself am in therapy and I think he might have an undiagnosed anxiety disorder (I have one as well).   Thank you again for the advice. All of this is very helpful.
ENFP,3bjswo,hintofsass,2,Tue Jun 30 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Ask your therapist about how to encourage him? I don't really know how to do this. If you've told him that you're in therapy, you can explain that it has helped you (nix this first bit if you don't want to share that), and say directly that you are concerned about how his ex is/has hurt him, and you think he could benefit from getting someone's professional perspective on the situation if he is open to just trying it out. You could offer to get him a recommendation of a therapist from your therapist or something if he wants. Say that maybe a therapist could give him some new ideas on how to handle the situation?  Some therapists may offer an initial free consultation, I believe. This may be worth mentioning depending on his response.   I know you said he didn't listen to your initial concern, so he may not listen to you this time. He probably won't follow through. But it's probably worth bringing up just in case it plants a seed, and it shouldn't hurt for you to try this.   Good luck."

Much of my growth and stability in recent years has been the result of daily focus on gratitude and forgiveness - including forgiveness of yourself. Healthy habits have also compounded my confidence and attractiveness to women (While I'm great at it, I don't need to be excessively flirtatious for attention anymore).   TL;DR: Make yourself a little better everyday, and don't get hung up on other humans. They're thinking about you a lot less than you think."

I hate that jealous feeling because it eats me away like a virus and I still don't know how to cope with that. Then my jealousy turns into guilt, which ultimately motivates me to do good things to 'make up' for being jealous. But ugh, I absolutely hate that feeling of being taken for granted, because I seriously feel that way a lot. It sucks that for every hundred I meet, only one ever sticks around or gives a shit, and maybe 20-30 will at least say they do. Despite being very emotional sometimes, I can't cry. God knows I've tried. This makes it hard for me to connect to people's miseries, and blunts any sweet words and prickles my embrace. It turns me into this hideous thing exempt from forgiveness and isolates me from any group I'm in.

Because we LUUUURVE people, it can be hard for them to know what's going on and then can get upset when it seems like we're sending out a ""flirty"" set of signals when in fact we're thinking ""friendly"".  It really helps to get it straight inside your own head, because then it makes it easier to self-censor the more ""flirty"" stuff unless we really mean it.  Yes, people can misunderstand even friendly banter, but as the communicators, it is up to us to make sure that we are being completely clear in our messages to the communicatee.  So if people were commenting that you were flirting with each other a simple ""Oh no we're just friends meeting for the first time"" would have set everyone, and him, straight.  As it was, maybe he's feeling a bit messed around at the moment - especially if you weren't clear about what you wanted from him and were sending him mixed signals.  I do know that its lovely to float along the liminal cusp between friendship and desire - but because we send out such a strong signal, its not really fair to do this to other people.  This also stops people from falling madly in love with you, when all you were doing was ordering pizza.  Soooo.... having said all that, if you do actually LIKE him, and he works at the same hospital, and you spent a week chatting with him, then presumably you know at least which area he works in. Go hunt him down and ask him out for coffee !!"

A lot of enfp still feel the need to have alone time and reflect.   I'd say your best bet is to study up on Ne and Fi and see which you prefer.

I am incredibly driven, and tackle my goals head on in ways I haven't witnessed INFPs in my life doing.

To be honest it probably isn't the best course to go but It helps me so much I couldn't imagine stopping now. Being a turbulent personality type can be difficult, it also means you're more susceptible to feeling high and lows.

I read into everything people do, everything they say...and I'm even better at picking up on what they choose NOT to say or do.  Sometimes it's great, other times it'd be nice to shut it off for a day and just wait to see what the fuck happens.  If you have more-than-friendly feelings for her, there's a pretty good chance she suspected it long before you did.  Now, a lot of people might think ""Well, if she did but didn't make a move she's probably not interested in anything more than friendship and I shouldn't say anything"".  FALSE!  She's an ENFP.  If she's anything like me, she's nice to everyone and does a pretty good job of avoiding negative / toxic people.  When I say I'm ""nice to everyone"", I mean in my way of being nice (being goofy as fuck, funny, sarcastic, talkative, willing to talk about personal things most people would be uncomfortable discussing with strangers, acquaintances and platonic friends).  People think I'm flirting with them ALL. THE. TIME. That means when I have a feeling someone like-likes me, it is very rare I lay my cards on the table.  If anything, I just act like it's not even happening. Even if I'm in love with the dude.  This has nothing to do with fear of rejection (I'm not afraid of rejection because at least it gets me out of emotional, over-analytical limbo and allows me to move on with my life). It's important to me that the other person makes their feels known because it shows me those feels are actually genuine.  Not something I've picked up on and reciprocated in response.  Considering I'm a good person and relatively attractive, I believe it gives an opportunist an easy way in.  TLDR: Just tell her.  Flat out.  Even if she doesn't feel the same way, she'll respect the fact that you had the balls to do it and keep you in her life (in whatever way makes the most sense) FOREVER."

Can't speak for the entire ENFP race, but I am around her age and have learned (through painful experience) to be very patient about these things.  If I'm in love with the guy, I don't say a word because that means I really, really need it to be authentic. If a friend is flirting with me and I already know I do not feel that way about him, I behave much differently.  I'm good at putting you in the friend zone carefully.  In ways that will avoid embarrassing you or ruining our friendship. ""You're like a brother to me!""..."
ENFP,3b2h4j,BasicBarbarian,2,Thu Jun 25 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a pretty real phenomenon. When you're open, and friendly, people are open and friendly back. And there will always be people who don't really care that intensely about you, but they'll take what they can get. So over the years, I tend to hold more and more back when it comes to approaching men, because I've been in too many scenarios where I've been the one who was ""good enough for now"" because I was more approachable than the dream woman that would intimate them. Or I've been the woman who hits all the superficial ""check list boxes"" on OKC, and the man completely glosses over my actual personality and needs.   And maybe this is just in my head, but damn if it isn't an insecurity of mine. I mean, shit. I want a love that is powerfully genuine. I want to know I am actually wanted. And accepted. I know limerence isn't permanent, love requires compromise, etc. I'm cool with that. But I've been in too many relationships where I was just a ""logical choice"" and there was no limerence what so ever on their part. And it left me feeling empty and sort of used.   With that, I have to accept the role I had by accepting those situations, and the only person's behavior I can change is my own. So I hold back and just appreciate the friendship for the current state that it's in.   As for signs that I'm actually interested in someone, hell. Everything turns on it's head and there's really no telling. Usually the more into someone I am, the more I'll play it cool and hold my feelings to my chest. The only way you can tell is if you directly confront me about it. Because then I'm forced to face all of that, and I turn into a deer in the head lights only to upgrade to a stuttering mess if the other person presses the subject. Pretty teenage behavior for a 28 year old woman, but it is what it is."
ENFP,3b2h4j,DumBunny,3,Thu Jun 25 19:21:42 2015 UTC,"I know, right? I feel that way too. I don't want her to be with me because I'm the logical choice. I want her to be with me because of... well... me.  But I'm comprehending now. ENFP's are not confrontational and this situation actually requires it. Then, I need her to fully understand exactly how I feel in order to make it easier for her to decide. Otherwise, things can be led astray and with an unsatisfying end for us both, since she will try hard to be cool and polite about it. Thank you.      Because then I'm forced to face all of that, and I turn into a deer in the head lights.   Ow. That insight was a Basicaly Barbarian one."
ENFP,3b2h4j,Voxous,3,Thu Jun 25 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, when it comes to romance, feelers make their choices based on their feelings. Logic frequently goes out the window if it's considered at all. She's going to make the choice that is right, because it feels right.   And the thing with being an ENFP type is that we actually make decisions pretty quickly when they can't be run from. We know in our gut if it's wrong. Unless you have completely slipped under her radar, and she's never even entertained the thought, then she's already has a direction she's turned towards. I think this is a Ne vs Ni thing. All of my INTJ and INFJ friends like to spend much more time mulling over their thoughts.    Ow. That insight was a Basicaly Barbarian one.    Yeah...contrary to the poster above me, I actually am very afraid of rejection and warping friendships. Like, I'll hold onto feelings until I've gotten to a point of such sickness that I just tell them hoping that they will confirm my self doubts, just so I can lick my wounds and move on."

ENFP,3b2h4j,friendly-dropbear,2,Fri Jun 26 12:09:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on the situation. If it's a new friendship and there's enough chemistry when we hang out for me to feel like it should be a date, I'll make it obvious I have a crush on you. I may or may not admit, but it will be obvious you have my undivided attention. I'll answer your calls, interrogate you like it's my job, and I won't care if I'm always the one texting first. I might cancel my plans to see you, or do other really sweet, considerate things. If it's already a dating situation / ""seeing each other"" and I start to develop more serious feelings, I will tell you that flat out. I'm not sure when I make the first move with old friends because I feel like unless circumstances prevent me from going there (one or both of us are in a committed relationship already), I tend to know how I feel about people and whether or not a romantic relationship could be possible very quickly.  I know the one time I did make the first move with an old friend I felt completely safe doing it."
ENFP,3b2h4j,WoobahWoobah,6,Fri Jun 26 13:45:09 2015 UTC,"INTP here. I don't think any friendship that would be ruined by an expression of admiration, even one followed by a rejection, is a relationship worth maintaining. Of course, I think very few relationships are worth maintaining so you might take my advice with a grain of salt.   My point is that you should go for it."
ENFP,3b2h4j,youawakeinyourbed,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I intend to go for it. But I think I need a plan for how to do it. How to hint that I like her and how to pick signs if she likes me to - ""Wow, easy cowboy. Being nice to you doesn't mean I like you that way"", you know?  The relationship won't be ruined I guess, but things might get weird. It's easier to read the feelings of a fellow INTJ or INTP, but she's a mystery to me, just like I think I'm mystery to her. And to be honest, this is kind of awesome too. Mystery warm things up for her, while for me it's a riddle I'd like to solve :P"
ENFP,3b2h4j,shumna,6,Thu Jun 25 13:58:23 2015 UTC,"""Hey, would you like to get dinner (day of week) evening?"" If she seems uncertain if you mean as a date, clarify. If she says she's busy, ask if there's any night she'd be available.  That's it. If she straight up isn't interested, she'll probably let you down easy.  ENFPs generally want to be friends with everyone so I doubt it will affect your friendship much even if she's not interested. The only other thing is, if she says no, accept it and move on.  Do not pine over her or become obsessive. That will piss anyone off.  Edit: I know INTJs generally don't like to be in risky situations but this is one that's way less risky than it feels. Plus INTJs with guts are way more attractive."

I was just worried how she would feel and internalize this situation... I know I'd promptly ready to move if she says no -- in fact, I'd be relieved to just let it out of my chest and have my mind at ease again.   I'll try to not let things get weird, /u/FlutterShy-.

ENFP,3b2h4j,abhayasinha,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:30:02 2015 UTC,"Want to know how she'll feel and internalize the situation? I think it'll have more to do with the situation (how she feels, how you let her know about your feelings) than about her ENFP-ness.   Talk to her, and really listen."
ENFP,3b2h4j,RESERVA42,3,Fri Jun 26 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"I prefer a few little hints here and there, then blatant reveal, and I've never stopped being friends with someone who asked me out.

ENFP,3b2h4j,Dejay79,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:06:10 2015 UTC,Yep. I'd go for little hints. Not a fan of a blatant reveal. But do you fancy any way for me to do it?
ENFP,3b2h4j,bezald,3,Thu Jun 25 14:00:38 2015 UTC,"ENFPs have a depth and a secrecy to them. We let few people deeply know us, and aren't the fastest at self-awareness. But we want acceptance and encouragement to be ourselves fully. So show her that you know her, you get how she works, and you'll build up trust with her. You can do this through friendly banter or by putting the pieces together when she's sharing something within herself. Show her in the small ways that she can trust you, and she'll start thinking she can trust you more in the larger ways, too.  Also, I'm not sure this is more of an ENFP thing or not, but I love inside jokes. I feel like we're creating a stronger connection between us. So maybe okay on that a bit. If I were trying to tell me that I liked me, I would build it up through some reference or symbolism, maybe from a movie you watch and discuss to something you're talking about or see.  And maybe push your own boundaries and limits a bit. Try something with her that we finds fun and exhilarating, that might make you uncomfortable. Maybe you'd much rather not do that thing. But if she's you'll try something with her, and because of her, she'll start getting the hints.  I second everyone else saying to finally just tell her. But these are some ways to start building it up with her.    Edit: Signs to tell how she feels. Part of it goes back to opening up, feeling more comfortable to share more of herself with you. And then you have the common natural signs everyone has: more eye contact then turning away, different kinds of touches (if she's more a hugging person, has she started just holding your arm?), close proximity and wanting to be around you, etc. It's hard to tell without knowing her better, so these are more like guidelines. Here's the point: look for differences in the way she acts toward you versus others."

Because the second one implies that all you do, everytime you try something new about you, when you want to physically change, it's directed by the thoughs of other people. It means that you'll slightly becoming, years after years, what others want you to be, or what they expect from you. Also, there are two many different people out there, with each their own point of view and thoughs, so it's impossible to see what everyone think about you at the same time; because some will like you, some won't, some will find you attractive, some won't, some will find you funny, some won't, some will like how you dress, some won't etc...

ENFP,3b2hie,SmyxKuqobrup,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"As an INFP, I would rather not be able to see how people perceive me, regardless of other consequences, than be able to see any amount of ENFP love in the mirror every morning. The thoughts of the ENFP I know might be mixed with everyone else's thoughts, but I would find them, and seeing an ENFP perspective in a daily normal way would give me an emotional stability and independence that I need.  A reminder every morning that I'm a passionately caring individual would make my life seem complete, but I worry that I might use that emotional independence for entirely personal reasons.   The first thing I would probably do is get a pocket-size mirror so I could admire myself through an ENFP point-of-view. I might look at it just once to spot the ENFP love, but I would save furthur glimpses of gratitude for when I need a confidence boost. When a friend is moody and avoiding everyone, instead of feeling conflicted and getting involved far too late, I would peek at the mirror to remind myself how caring and understanding I am so I would not hesitate to help. When a friend is feeling depressed, I'll look in the mirror to see how reliable my ENFP friend thinks I am, so I'll be motivated right away to explain to that depressed friend how much they matter to me and to thank them for all they've done for me.   I would get all the encouragement I want to have, but don't ask for, through the pocket mirror, from my ENFP friend, without them knowing that I am using them that way. Over time, with mistakes and successes, my other friends may start to care about me more, and I will see that change in the mirror. Knowing exactly how much good I've recently done, would give me a real ego for the first time in my life. Nothing matters quite as much as helping people feel good about themselves, but being completely aware of how people appreciate my efforts would give me an obsession over doing more and more good in the lives of the people around me. Nothing would matter except turning the image in the mirror into someone extremely loving, understanding, caring, altruistic and good.   My ENFP friend, being only one person, eventually wouldn't matter anymore, their perspective on me contributing so little to the giant compilation of perspectives in the mirror. If I could see what others thought of me, I would choose to do charity work helping in disaster zones and developing countries rather than stay near my friends and family. If I could see what others thought of me, I would choose to help hundreds of people daily far away rather than build a romantic relationship with a single person. Being able to see what others think of me would change me, and I would probably lose most of who I am now. Presently that level of loss and change is terrifying, despite that I would have chosen to change.  TL;DR: I would rather see anything at all in mirrors than see what people think of me, because easy access to what my ENFP friend thinks of me would give me a strong feeling of self-worth that would stir too much change in my life."

ENFP,3b0egu,PLNR920,2,Wed Jun 24 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah! All the time! You're certainly not alone on this one. I found myself nodding to everything you've typed.  I somehow manage to deal with it by seeing where the people providing the ""black and white"" opinions/judgements/whatever are coming from. But, yes, it's still exhausting.  I learnt from my mother that people aren't bad, the choices they make are and they always have an opportunity to change or become better. However, I've also learnt to not invest myself too much into helping someone out, that at the end of the day, it's up to them. If they're not going to be able to help themselves then I have to step back for my own health and wellbeing.  I guess what makes it less exhausting is I have had to teach myself to be objective. Don't put emotion into everything. Have empathy/sympathy but also remember to take a step back.   As far as discussions go, it's good to see the things in-between so you can make an overall conclusion for yourself. Being an extrovert, I know it's hard but, you don't always have to share your thoughts. You can keep them to yourself, acknowledge what other people are saying so they know they're being heard, then agree to disagree.  Am I making sense? I don't know, I suck at explaining things.   I'm looking forward to other comments with advice on this!!!"
ENFP,3b0egu,ioffendreason,2,Thu Jun 25 01:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yes! I definitely am the same way. I've found that I tend to be very diplomatic, see both sides of an idea, and prefer not to take a side. The other night, my boyfriend and I were debating about cyber security and privacy (our kind of fun, hah), and I felt that I saw the good and bad in both perspectives. On the other hand, he, as an ENTJ, was more solid with his opinion.  It's easy to lose enthusiasm when you feel like you are responsible for moderating the discussion. If you're anything like me, I can imagine you'd want to make sure everyone is heard. I think you are valuable in discussions as you make sure everyone sees all aspects of an idea. You give people something new to consider.   Place yourself outside of the discussion. If someone doesn't hear you and refuses to see a different perspective, don't take it internally. It isn't your fault they don't get what you're saying. As they say, ""You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"".  Another thing: give yourself permission to be candid.  Good luck!"
ENFP,3b0egu,smellslikenewbooks,2,Thu Jun 25 08:46:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, I've always felt like this but didn't know it was an ENFP trait... It's been getting me down a lot too lately, and not just because of external conflicts and circumstances that need to be 'moderated', but also because it's like I can't ever believe in one thing or the other. My whole reality is full of paradoxes and contradictions and not being able to hang on to certain solid truths, beliefs, or values, and it's taking it's toll."
ENFP,3b0egu,abhayasinha,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:51:39 2015 UTC,"Same thing here, which made me choose not to have an opinion about (mostly) anything.  Having an opinion is overrated. Most of them are not helpful at all in terms of living our lives, and are not relevant in any other way than to fill up silence through the means of discussion.  We are taught, nowadays more than ever), to have an opinion about everything. If you don't have one, you're weird. But all an opinion actually does is divide us, which goes entirely against an ENFP, who dislikes conflict and prefers to bring people together (well, I do).  Opinions are a bit like clothes. They can suit you or not, they can contradict, they can be extreme, but they don't impair your actual skills. You can think all illegal immigrants should be locked up, and still be a fine developer. You can call yourself a liberal/democrat/left-wing/right-wing/anything and still be a good friend/spouse/doctor.  I chose to have barely any opinions anymore, but instead hold on to facts. What have I really experienced myself and what did I learn from that? Climate change? I am not a scientist, so don't ask me, I can look at all these statistics you show me, but how do I know they are legit? How should I know how to interpret this data if it is? And are you going to treat me differently based on my answer?  When people are in a discussion, I don't feel like interfering, it's their discussion. If they need me to mediate, they will ask me. If they ask me 'and what do you think?', I will probably say that I'm no expert so my opinion is not important, or I might share my observations, like their discussion techniques or fallacies that I've noticed.   Reality is full of paradoxes, because the truth is buried under an infinite amount of perspectives. That's why you shouldn't hold on to that, just keep yourself busy with the things that happen directly around you and that might actually be in your control.  I almost forgot, about not being able to believe in one thing or the other: Just believe in everything and nothing at the same time. Accept that truth doesn't exist and be amazed about the ideas people come up with. Never tell anyone his idea is wrong, but let them talk and you just ask questions. Even if it's utter bullshit, get to know their thought process. If people don't feel judged, they are willing to share more and are more open to your views."

And I know a lot of people that works that way. A LOT. But I like some of them. And I love some others. They're all people. They can't be perfect, and there is obviously at least one thing about them you won't like. Even your soulmate, even your parents, even your kids. At some points, there will be something in them that you don't really like. And that's ok, that's how human are, how we work. The point is to not define the entire person with this little thing you don't like. See how fun they are, how careful they are, how intelligent or whatever. Because that's what really counts, and that's why you spend time with them.    And don't say that you ""don't like INFJ's"". First, because two ""INFJ's"" can be very different. MBTI is a tool to ""classify"" people according to their cognitive functions, according to ""the way they think"". Of course, because of that, there are similarities between two people belonging to the same group, but they can be different. Secondly, because you don't know them all.

ENFP,3b1u8o,Lumenis,2,Thu Jun 25 14:11:42 2015 UTC,"It's perhaps a bit harsh and slightly ignorant to assume that all INFJ are identical, in both behavior, opinion, attitude and whatever drives communication. There are those who are very calm, composed and adapt well to the other individuals they are interacting with. Everyone can be intense, it's again a matter of perspective and how we all grow up to perceive that which happens around us. In comparison to most other people I speak with, I'd consider myself the most relaxed. Can I be intense too, and possibly drive someone crazy with ideas, opinions and views, most certainly.  I do think it's important to understand that, regardless if one is aware or not at all of intensity, you are at a great advantage if you learn to observe others and recognize behavior. No matter how similar I may be or seem to another humans, there will always be so many things that set us apart.  Perhaps you consider my writing for being intense too, I wouldn't really know, but others perceive it differently. I most certainly don't take offense for reading a post such as this, but I'm not the type that gets easily offended anyway. Maybe it has a lot to do with the country I'm from, where I grew up and the people I've met so far in my life.  I'm not here to try change your look on INFJ or anything else for that matter, merely to perhaps give you a perspective into the mind of someone else, and perhaps you'll see some value in that too. Either way you are more than welcome to hold any view that you so desire, but I do believe that many have a tendency to either over or underestimate others, even ourselves at times.  As with most things I do believe people that have an open mind, no matter their personality, they are also more flexible with receiving ideas as well as how they wish to perceive issues. I will grant you that it can take some time to get to know some people, perhaps INFJ especially. That said I do consider myself for an open book, I can give long answers but also more brief and concrete ones. Typically I prefer to add substantial information as I believe it gives other people a better view into a situation, as we so easily can misjudge and misinterpret others when words are sparse."

Small talk is fine, I enjoy a bit of gossip, but I fucking live for heated discussions about controversial stuff. I think it's mainly because I can often take either side. I see both perspectives, and then I feel sort of conflicted, but it always results in the most interesting questions and the most heated debates because I get to be the one who stirs the pot.  Other than that, I can talk for hours about my things that really interest me, such as music, pop culture, literature and fitness. It can be hard to get me to shut up when I find someone who shares one of those passions in common."

ENFP,3b0vcj,BasicBarbarian,3,Thu Jun 25 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"Haha, the last dream I actually remember had my ISTP friend in it. Turns out he joined a research team, which discovered time travel. From that point forward, he would periodically go into hibernation and only come out when the world needed him, save the day, curve the course of time, and then go back into hibernation for another 50-100 years only to do it all over again. And that's why we only saw him every so once in a while, and he had an ageless quality to him. (The ageless part is true. His best friend likes to tease him that he is actually 35 and has a family he never speaks of, even though he was younger than the rest of us by 2 years.)  And of course I had to ask him what the future was like. He told me that Charles Shultz actually was born 750 years in the future, but had stumbled on the time machine himself, going back into the forties to produce his comic, Peanuts, while everyone's standards were low enough to make him a fortune.   Yes. ISTP found this very amusing.   I don't always remember my dreams, but when I do, they come with plots."

I basically get to read lots of books about what people do in their daily lives in societies all over the world, and how that matters in understanding mankind.

Once I got that out of my system, I realised that the only difference is that other people just aren't as quick in offering their help as we are. At the end of the day, if you ask your friends to be there for you (which takes courage, I know. No idea why, but asking for help has always been one of the hardest things in life for me) they will be there for you, without fail. And if they aren't then they're probably not friends worth holding on to :)"

ENFP,3b0bao,SeductivePillowcase,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure :) Also the thing that will make me feel least wanted is not when people take my help for granted but rather when they forget how out of my way I'll go to help them and they just try to deal with their problems themselves.   If you won't let me smother you in compliments and encourage the hell out of you and bring you food the moment you LOOK hungry, I feel like I have pretty much no purpose.

The ones who do, still can't tell whether or not I need their help. But since they see I'm working so hard on covering things up, they typically figure that I don't want them to bother.  And while yes, we all want to be recognized and nurtured sometimes, unless people know that it's ok to give that to you, they might be afraid that they're going to cross into your personal boundaries. After all, you have this well established role of being strong and helping them out all the time, that they don't recognize when you're stressed and anxious. And if they're not very good at socializing, or they have anxiety issues themselves...then they really don't know how to approach you and they might be terrible with their cues in the first place.   Pick one, and let them know that you're not doing well. Let yourself be obviously vulnerable. Or the next time they're talking about their problems, after listening a little while, let them know how much you relate.   I'm not trying to pin this on you. But I say this because when I have been in your situation before, it was usually because I didn't know how to ask for help. I had to directly ask, not just hint. Then people come. And they always wanted to give back, but they just had no idea how until I told them what I needed."

She used to take things for granted, it took her literally losing everything..both the good and the bad, and starting new like a Phoenix. This fresh view allowed her to truly appreciate what she had, and she had to fully commit to the change and work on thinking these thoughts everyday. Props to you for recognizing you need to change :)"

I'm glad your SO figured her stuff out - it sucks that she had to go through all that, but it takes what it takes for everyone."

In exactly what ways does he challenge you, why is it so fulfilling? Are you sure the biggest factor is his unavailability in specific? You called it a cycle, so have you noticed that this actually is a trend? If you keep spending most of your focus on the lookout for something better, then of course you're never going to see any of the beautiful potentiality that exists in the now. What's actually available to you now? If you're not paying attention, all of what could be golden opportunities will pass right by without you ever noticing they existed. How do you know what will or won't be short-lived and temporary? Those futures don't exist, and they only seem true because that's how you choose to construct them. Always be careful of idealising someone! Be aware that you make decisions based on what you actually know about a person rather than what you're hoping for in them. You recognize you're blowing off people who may have genuine interest in you. If you look at it from their perspective, they've also fallen for someone who's unavailable to them--because unfortunately she's occupied with waiting for someone who isn't gonna come. Do what you know is right, and what you know would be best for you."
ENFP,3asfv8,heinzovisky91,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:22:23 2015 UTC,"You're only interested because you know he's not available for you? You said you like that he challenges you. In exactly what ways does he challenge you, why is it so fulfilling?    Well no - I'm interested for a lot of reasons. I like him a lot. But yeah, I absolutely have noticed a pattern in myself that I consistently find myself hung up on the guys who can't/won't make themselves available to me. He's only one example of many, but specifically, he challenges me by calling me out. He makes me talk about my feelings like, WHEN THEY'RE HAPPENING, not when I've had time to internalize and process them, which leads to greater self-awareness and more openness and honesty. He sees things about me that I don't see or haven't explored and he draws them out in me. I'm very attracted to that. I'm pretty sure he's an INTJ, if that makes it make more sense.   Are you sure the biggest factor is his unavailability in specific? You called it a cycle, so have you noticed that this actually is a trend?    It's not his unavailability that MAKES him attractive, but it's probably fair to say it's what keeps me on the hook. If he were to all of the sudden change paths and came to me like ""yes, I like you, let's date"" I'd probably be like ""woahhh hold up wait a minute, what are you getting at? Why do you even like me anyway? What do you want?"" Which is SO SHITTY.    If you keep spending most of your focus on the lookout for something better, then of course you're never going to see any of the beautiful potentiality that exists in the now. What's actually available to you now? If you're not paying attention, all of what could be golden opportunities will pass right by without you ever noticing they existed.    That's exactly what I do and I hate it. I'm just always looking for the ""best"" opportunity and I'm sure I miss out on a lot. As far as what's available to me - I COULD be using the free time I set aside for him to, you know, actually go out and meet other people. Like, I'm on OkCupid, which is fine and all, but I am just so 100% over first dates and small talk and not having any sort of connection with the people I meet. Instead, I use the time I could spend meeting people just chasing cars and getting nowhere.  Like I fully recognize the futility of what I'm doing and I realize I'm not doing myself any favors by continuing to spend time with this guy (no matter how much we like each other or how much he challenges me). But it's a cycle I don't know how to break."
ENFP,3asfv8,heinzovisky91,3,Tue Jun 23 13:38:59 2015 UTC,"Not a woman, so take my input however you please. :)    I came out of a relationship that wasn't fulfilling me for quite some time. I am actually quite happy that it ended by her cheating on me because I would probably still be in that relationship if she didn't give me a good reason to go (besides the obvious ones I was willing to work on). Anyway. I was standing there. 28. All alone. Came out of a 4-year relationship. Had a job that I loved at a company that I did not like... and had an epiphany after too many nights of feeling lonely.    I know this is a ""male thing"" and you will find this stuff in subreddits like TheRedPill which I also used but obviously rejected as too one sided hateful bullshit that it is... but I indulged myself in a philosophy called ""Men going their own way"". I liked that view because to me it was clear that if I am not living up to my potential, why the hell would anybody ever be with me? And wouldn't I sell myself way too lowly if I got a partner based on my then-achievements? Nah. I wanted the full life. I wanted to kick myself in the butt to only do things that I wanted. No women involved. No romance, no affairs, no intimacy, ... you get the deal.    So I quit at the company that I did not like. Got a new job at another company that gave me a promotion and way more money. Started playing the guitar again, read a shit ton of books I loved, completed a 100 movies in 360 days challenge, hit the gym regularly, flew to Singapore (from Europe....) for a week just to indulge myself with the best food on the planet, ... I loved every second of only doing what I wanted without the distraction of ""wanting"" or ""needing"" someone besides me. There was only me... and while it sounds egocentric, I got used to myself and started liking me way more than I could ever imagine. I even thought that I am so happy that I will never ever let outer circumstances influence my well-being... I loved every second of this time.    And then... I got to know my SO better. I knew her before but she was always way out of my league. And she wasn't even interested in me. But I have become more than I ever was... and well... it worked. We're engaged now and I still love doing things for myself... BUT I prefer sharing my time with her because she is simply amazing.    TLDR: Focus on yourself first. Get to know yourself. Other people are just a distraction while your puzzle will sort itself out somehow. You will see."
ENFP,3asfv8,deliciousmeats,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:26:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much the same situation. I broke up some time ago with a girl I really loved. She was the first person ever I had THAT CONNECTION, you know? We made plans, felt whatever the other one was feeling, etc. Then, after a while, she just got bored. She would say that she still loved me, but was not sure what was wrong. After a while, she started behaving weirdly and I broke with her, because I think she was having an affair with a friend of hers. Now I can't bring myself to connect to nobody. I already been through the rough stuff, and I'm much better. But, still, nobody I tried to date after her felt even close to what we had. So I'm pretty much giving up on feeling that ago, at least for now. That makes me lonely as fuck.  Anyway,  I have two guys who are very close friends. Both of them are in relationships with amazing girls. Those guys are my friends for a long time now, but I'm feeling I can't connect to them very well anymore. They have their own lives, their own problems, and they simply can't spend that much time and energy towards me anymore, and I completely understand. But makes me sad, because each day, I feel that I don't know no one I can really share things like I used to. It's a feeling I don't belong to any group anymore, you know? I suffered a lot with this when I broke up, but now that I'm better overall, I'm trying just to cope with it. I'm being a little less expansive that I always have been, and I'm actually dating a girl right now that I feel shares nothing whatsoever with me. But at least my expectations are low right now. I don't expect to feel for her what I felt for my ex. I think it's going to be a while until I feel that again.  Anyway, I feel I get where you are right now. I can't have my ex right now, I can't have the connection I had with my friends before. I feel lonely ALL THE TIME. I got used to watch movies alone, to play games alone, watch tv shows alone, go on walks alone, etc etc. I think it's great I don't feel as bad for doing those things alone as before (I always have been a super social guy). But it's lonely indeed. Super lonely haha.  I wish i could give you advice, but I'm really in the same position."

(It's prob fine to paste in). Someone would also need to upload the pics used and make sure the filenames are exact. I'm not an artist so anything around I can incorporate into the css will be great.  In terms of image size, anything that loads fast.

Also, sorry for that the next couple of questions are going to be dumb, but I want to make sure I call for the right things when I make a call for artists. Can you give me a range of sizes that are obviously too small or too big? Is there different file types that are preferable for loading speeds?"
ENFP,3arq54,libelle156,2,Wed Jun 24 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's a shopping list with some very rough pixel requirements. To make it easy, artists could save the image at the link and place something over the top. All should be .png  rule of thumb - the smaller you can get it and have it still look alright the better.    upvote and downvote buttons - these need to be TINY That might have been 25 by 25px top banner - very flexible on size but keep the length/height ratio  other random pics (sidebar, footer etc.) very flexible on these but this is a good guide replacing the subreddit name with a design like this one watermarks need to be incredibly opaque - like drag that shit in photoshop down to 5 percent. You'd be amazed how much they show up. Tiled images are awesome.    images can be submitted as imgur links here to make it easy."

ENFP,3arq54,Ras-Algethi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:30:24 2015 UTC,"Here's my official stance. Other mods are welcome to chime in.   We are not against a new design. None of us have either the ability or the time to do it all on our own. If someone else wants to do it, all they have to do is be proactive. However, when these threads come up, people say they're interested in helping, but no one ever contacts the mods, and things barely get into a brainstorming stage let alone past it.   It's a stereotype we seem to live up to.   That being said. To get any design past me, and eventually voted on by the members of the sub, this is what needs to happen.    It needs to stay in a minimalist style that preserves functionality of the site, preferably the older reddit one. The new style that you see on places like /r/ENTP and /r/IntuitiveDominant, has a few hiccups with reddit suite that make it so that your user name shows even if you are trying to cover it, it also tends to cram all your links so you can't see them if you browse multiple reddits. I'm not entirely against it, but I don't believe it's optimal. Special attention needs to be given to the links and resources to make it easy for users to find what they want.  The design can't be too busy, have glaring color combinations, or otherwise be an eye sore. Like literally. No eye fatigue.  The design should certainly have an ENFP vibe to it, but I refuse to let it be defined by a stereotype of exclusively childish shit. I don't think that represents our complex personalities very well.    Yeah, that's pretty much it on my end. Functional, attractive, and an accurate homage to the ENFP personality that doesn't alienate the less cutesy users. And if there's more than one design submitted that fits these requirements, then the final design will be decided by vote from the general user base.

Two of my close friends will be hitting the four year mark of knowing me in the coming year. The same thing will happen. One moved halfway across the country two years ago (I don't know how we've managed to keep contact strong) and the other one will be moving to live on a sailboat.  But weirdly, I'm the constant. I've been in the same place for 7 years now. Everything just swirls around me and I dip into different groups of people and get to know them for a couple years and then things change and either they move on or I feel disconnected and stop reaching out.  I should just move across country alone and start over completely. I'm the only constant in my life so it literally doesn't matter if I do. What a dangerous mood to be in reading this post."

And no... I do not know how to identify people. I mostly get to know people and from time to time, I look at MBTI sites and categorize the people I met beacuse I don't want those MBTI types define the way I see people, I want to explore people without looking for confirmation of signs that show they fit into a certain category.

So we cut it off amicably when I had to move. He was such a wonderful person. I miss him.   So yeah, I'm with you that pretty much anyone can be a good match if they're a good person, and the timing is right.

He would then resist letting me help him, until I'd do it anyway, and then he would be very appreciative.   In general, he was just hard on himself."
ENFP,3appr9,BasicBarbarian,3,Mon Jun 22 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"Cool. So yeah... obvious... not all people are the same. Maybe that's the masculine slack there as well... I can only say that I have yet to have a positive encounter with a female ISTJ or ESTJ because I cannot stand it when they judge me based on their standards. They are usually also quite stubborn from what I experienced and you cannot reason with them or convince them otherwise when they applied their judgment on you.     My ex used to force me to do so many chores. I know it has to be done but I hate mundane routine work. Honestly, I could not see why she wanted the floor to be vacuumed regularly and she could not even explain it to me... but it had to be done. She would also feel super disrespected if I kicked off my boots and not put them in the boots drawer, let my socks on the floor, etc. Having a steady job seemed to be the most important thing for her. She hated the job she had and it ruined our relationship because she was always so down and it affected her. She would also not do anything about her situation because security was so high up her priorities. Always. She would never break any rules whatsoever. She absolutely could not handle spontaneous things. After job hunting for quite some time she finally got a good one and she called me. An hour later I met her and threw glitter in the air to celebrate. Worst mistake ever. The only thing I remember was her totally bewildered face and she only cared about getting the floor spotless again.   At work, it seems to me that they are so set on rules that they are very much suited for routine tasks. They never really appreciate you for being a bit more ""creative"" or ""visionary"" and often think that you don't work as hard as they do. I had to face this stereotype by them so often and I still do not know how to handle it. I try to respect them and their contributions because I know that it needs both, people who get shit done and people who think forward... but they think it's only about getting shit done.     I have yet to actively identify a male ISTJ / ESTJ. I have not gotten to know one of their kind yet :)"
ENFP,3appr9,landingshortly,5,Mon Jun 22 19:17:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm...yeah. That sounds a like she had a bit of an obsessive compulsive trait along with some control issues.   But hey! I can give you some good examples of ISTJs!  My Dad is an ISTJ. He's a stereotypical man's man. Quiet, kinda detached from his feelings, very much defined by his work, which is management at a packing house. He cares about common sense, following through on your word, and making your own independent decisions so you don't have to follow anyone you consider a dumbass. He has some artistic hobbies, but they're typically done in a very organized, functional manner like woodworking. He's obsessed with puzzle, card, and board games and typically beats everyone because he'll immediately grasp the rules, pick up all the small details to exploit. He also doesn't respect artists or creative types unless they can turn their craft into something marketable. To him, that's a direct measurement of your contribution to society. And if you're not supporting yourself, you better be contributing something else to those who support you, or you're a leech.   The ISTJ I was dating had a lot of those same qualities, but you substituted the woodworking for hyper-realistic landscape painting and the love of gaming with cars and racing. Had a lot of traditional values, was quiet but close to his family. Complained a lot about the way people drove, because to him the actions you made were a direct indicator of your overall intelligence. Never made a promise he couldn't keep, very loyal to his friends. Overall, very meticulous in his decisions, art, spoken words, chosen values, etc. Kinda bewildered on what to do when approached with the sad feelings of someone he cared for. Had a lot of anxiety and self doubt issues when you got close to him. He just held the bar so high for himself.   Heh, he was also super protective of his car. Like, you knew it killed him inside if someone sat on the seats with buttons on their back pockets and you heard the noise of them scratching against the leather seat. But he was always very polite with the way he approached people about things like that, because it was in his values to do so. Unless he was very stressed out and anxious about something else, he wouldn't do any of the picking you suffered through. And we'd talk through that pretty easily when it happened.   Ultimately, all the rules my ISTJs seemed to make for themselves about the way to act, or to treat certain objects had a logic behind them, and the only time they couldn't express why it made sense to them is when they're distracted by being upset about something (probably that common sense being ignored).  And I found that if I respected something that they respected, then they really appreciate it as a sign of respecting and accepting who they are. Even if they didn't comment upon them, I know my efforts never went unnoticed. Because they don't really give verbal affirmation to let you know you're doing well, they give trust."

You have to be okay with a little emotional ambiguity and they can be a little withholding, but it's not intentional. The mental stimulation and the goofiness is worth it.  I don't think I know any other INTPs besides him. They have Ne as well and they're open to new experiences and information. And they tend not to be judgmental unless something prompts them to be (for my boyfriend, sometimes insecurity causes him to be down on other people).   My boyfriend says: Intelligent, analytical, emotionally aloof, they try not to upset ""the herd"", and are intermediaries in conflicts. They can get caught up in their own heads a lot. Typically more reserved when they first meet people and don't open up a lot (rather, it's difficult but they want to open up and don't know how to and let the thinking part talk them out of opening up.)

The INTP was really indecisive and awkward, we had been friends for a long time before we got together, I think that had something to do with it. He messed with my head, really. He let me pour my heart out, drank it up, never reciprocated. It was a weird relationship; we were both going through a hard time and it was a really bad idea. INTPs are beautiful people, at least by what I gathered from him, but I think to date one happily an ENFP would need more reassurance than I received.  The ENTJ was... A roller coaster. We dated about a year and a half, broke up and got back together 14 times after that sporadically, spending more time apart than together. I still love him, he's always going to have some small spot in my heart. We were best friends. He got to be almost obsessed with me, and that was weird... I couldn't take it anymore, being the manic pixie dream girl, because he didn't acknowledge my flaws. So I started finding some and throwing them at him. Soon it just became this garbled mess of something once beautiful. Sometimes I think if I were older when I met him it would've worked, but I'm glad that chapter is done.  I'm currently dating an ENFJ, and I think he's perfect :) we work well together. I usually have difficulty with people trying to cook alongside me, but he actually helps and doesn't make me want to scream. He's level headed, argues rationally, keeps my head out of the clouds. On the opposite end of that, he's really silly and plays the same way I do. He makes me feel confident, never messes with my emotions, and understands that I'm only human. He's extremely honest and sentimental. You can always spot an ENFJ being looked to as the leader of a group, I think."

I don't think INFPs and ENFPs are often seen as a good match, but I find that we mirror eachother while also bringing out the best in the other. He's more social and talkative after being with me for 15 years, and I'm more apt to slow down, relax, and ponder a bit. We had to learn to communicate... I don't let him brood too much, and he doesn't let me go on and on and on and on and on with no point. Other than an INTP I dated, it's the best match I've ever had, even if he's always on time.

ENFP,3ao9a4,writethatdown257,2,Mon Jun 22 03:39:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes, yes, yes x1000.  Sometimes I can be stressed out in life and I don't even have any problems. But the people around me have plenty for the both of us. The first thing you must accept is that it's not your problem, and it's not your job to fix it. It's a good thing to be concerned for their wellbeing, but they need to solve their problem on their own, and what they need is the right encouragement from you and maybe some advice if they ask, but do not swoop in to solve people's problems for them. You may even have the best of intentions doing this, but if you do this for too long people will become dependent on you to solve their problems. Then you'll have even more stress than to begin with. As hard as it may be to see the ones you love suffer a little, they need to grow. And they need your support and encouragement to help them grow, not to solve their problems. Feeling guilty for not checking in all the time isn't the way to go about things, especially if it begins to interfere with your personal life.  My coping strategies are to always have more than one group, so in case one gets too depressing and I've exhausted all my energy trying to cheer them up and I'm starting to feel depressed myself, then I hang out with another group for a bit that takes my mind off things. This way, I have many different support groups in case one is unable to help me. Second thing I like to do is to listen to motivational videos. When I'm down, sometimes it takes me as long as an hour of nonstop positive pep-talks to break my negative spirit. I believe the this is a very useful strategy, and it certainly got me through a lot of tough times when I had a limited group of friends and they were all sad and I had to be happy for like 10 other people.  More than likely, no matter what you do, you will always be affected by the people around you, both positively and negatively. So when you're feeling down, be sure to hang around a bunch of happy people! Hang out with 9 happy people and in time you'll be number 10!"

The problem just occurs with quite a few personality types that they are not seeking any help. They do not care about the solutions you have for them and that is what makes you feel rejected. Quite a lot of other personality types just want to talk about why they feel shit but they are not seeking for a solution. They are seeking for someone who would listen to them and say ""Yeah. I understand. Must be hard, right?"". I know this, because my fiancee is like this and that's OK because I love her and I can carry her shit when she has her phases (not too often, thankfully!).    When I see her being unhappy, it breaks my heart... I want to help her but at some point one has to accept that one cannot help people who do not want help from outside in the sense that we offer help. Mostly, people just feel better when they can off-load their shit onto someone else.    IF you have the energy to carry a lot of shit, please just listen and say ""Uhm. Must be hard, right?"" or ""Yeah, you are right, what a bi*ch!""... and they will feel better. If you don't, I also agree with /u/SeductivePillowcase to just find another group you can switch to in the meantime. I do not have a group of friends... I have so many people here and there that I always find someone who's willing to share our energy instead of gaining new energy off me while I get to keep their shit. Harshly said but true."

If you're using escapism to try to subconsciously fix something in your life, you need to figure out what that thing is, decide if it's something that needs to be addressed, and if it is, come up with a plan of action to deal with it. Take a vacation to figure things out. I don't mean a trip, though that would probably be beneficial, but think about how you react when you're going on vacation. Try to guide yourself through the emotional process of it so you can distance yourself enough from your life to look at it externally. We get so wrapped up in our feelings they can take control. We're not our thoughts, or our feelings. We're somewhere behind them. So find yourself again, and then slip the gloves back on so you can get back to interacting with the world in a meaningful way."

That escapism - for me its a 'sweeping under the rug', blissful ignorance which almost always ends in depression on account of feeling out of control and out of balance in my life. For me, getting back to reality is a process starting with the assertion that I am not wrong or inferior to others for having faults/weaknesses/undesirable traits. Some things are quirks that define me and for the others, well, I can work on them once I get back into a better headspace. If you are like me, a few negative relational experiences coupled with a tendency for existential inquiry and a highly introspective, questioning nature easily drive me to become unconfident and lacking in self-esteem. What wakes me up? Remembering that the people with whom I share this world are the fountain of energy from which I give and receive nourishment. We are extroverted, after all. When we move into introversion its mostly because of our emotional sensitivity to people and events. We start to obsess over things someone did or said and build a detailed landscape of an alternate reality based upon a few bad experiences. Sometimes I find myself requiring a mental discipline to 'like' people again, adopt a 'sticks and stones' mindset and be the confident, outgoing person I can be - without the pessimism. Soon enough, I'm talking real talk again, with real people, in a real and colourful world."

The reality is that we do have friends, just maybe not to the calibre of closeness that we expect. If its not a 100%, fulfilling relationship, its as good as nothing.  We're not completely alone in spite of our convincing ourselves otherwise. That lack of a stable presence is definitely a constant fear of mine.

I often let myself desire buying certain things for a min of 2 weeks (even as long as 2 years), just so I know I want it for a good reason. This comes into play with online shopping too – I put things into the cart and tell myself ""Sure, I can totally buy it, but let's wait like 2 days in case there's a sale/I find a promo code/do I want it bad enough""... and then I rarely end up buying it.   One of the ways I stay motivated to do something is when someone says I can't, i.e. ""I bet you can't learn that in just 3 days."" This lights a fire for me. I think, ""Fuck you, I totally can! Watch me be even better than you, dickface!"" Yes, the obscenities are necessary :)   I don't think it works as well when it involves small amounts of money (e.g. dietbet.com). I need either a massive amount of money, or a real social consequence. For example, I want to hear a genuine compliment/congrats from someone I admire, or I'll settle with receiving $1000.  I have an issue with an addiction (not a classic substance addiction though), and recently I'm starting to overcome it, or at least I know what my triggers are so I avoid them. For me, it starts when I'm alone + physically sitting in one place for too long. I also realized that when I'm not feeling like a slave to the addiction, it literally feels like the difference you feel right after overcoming a sickness. I feel like I'm more alert, productive, and I feel like a real human should feel. Knowing the general difference between feeling healthy & sick is incredibly important to overcoming the addiction, even when negative social/financial consequences are not helping."

I know another ENFP who used to talk about the masks she wore when dealing with people. The thing she never got was, once you wear a mask long enough, it becomes who you are. We ENFPs just tend to be more aware of the process. He wears the mask because he wants to entertain, but he wants to entertain because that's who he is. He is the swagger. There's nothing artificial about it. His admission had more to do with you than it did with him.  He knows his exuberance can make you uncomfortable, and he's already trying to make concessions--to put on another mask--in order to make you feel more comfortable. Not that the new mask is any less who he is. We're Silly Putty like that. So, take comfort in knowing he's heard you. He'll adapt to you. Try to bend back for him, too."

Does this mean that all ENFPs are like that? No. Every person is different.  The way this ENFP girl sees it is that she already sees so many people with low self-esteem - they constantly put themselves down. She wants to show people that you can feel good about yourself - it's OKAY to do this. It is inspiring and championing people at its core. Basically this:  ""We ask ourselves, 'who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people don't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."" - Marianne Williamson  Yes the behavior can be annoying in excessive doses but in the end I agree with the message. When people feel good about themselves, they are also quickly attacked, aren't they? To be taken down a notch?  So what can you do? Well, we cannot control other people. We can only control our own reactions. Some options on how to handle this may be to avoid her and keep interactions only to essentials, tolerate it, understand her behavior, or address your issues directly."
ENFP,3amtsk,corsetxcandy,3,Mon Jun 22 01:09:36 2015 UTC,"(Neutral observation from INTJ with ENFP and ISFJ in my life):   I can definitely see how a (often humble) ISFJ would be annoyed by the (perceived) bombast of an ENFP. Both your types are people-focused and caring, but approach life differently.  Key differences: first, the communication style differences between a Sensing (S) person and Intuitive (N) and, second, personality gaps between Extrovert (E) and Introvert (I).  First, as an ISFJ (drive by introverted sensing), you will usually speak in factual, concrete, clear, literal language (""This room only has one chair left. When did the chairs get moved and where are they now?""). An ENFP will speak in symbolic, abstract, layered, figurative language. (""That chair looks so lonely in that room! I wonder if all the other chairs packed up and moved to a new apartment!? I should be a chair detective! haha"") Most likely, the ENFP comes off to an ISFJ as bombastic and hyperbolic because they are using figurative exaggeration for affect. My recommendation is try not to take their playful banter too literally (he does not LITERALLY think he is the greatest, he is just playfully expressing his pride in something he did, for instance). Try, instead, to focus on the underlying/core point behind the hyperbole.  Likewise, ENFPs are very extroverted, they love to playfully take center stage (hence the drama tendency - theater drama and life drama). He likes being in the middle of the action and may even like being the center of attention. He adopts a swagger in a way that he probably perceives to be fun and engaging to others. You, as an ISFJ, really value when people, including yourself, take a more indirect and off-stage approach. You don't like being in the middle of the action, but, rather, monitoring safely from the sideline. Neither approach is good or bad, just different. He is not trying to outshine you or puff himself (probably), just playfully engaging those around him.  (Deep bow)"

ENFP,3amtsk,Buddhamama42,3,Sun Jun 21 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"He's entertaining people. I like to amuse people. To make them laugh. I use exaggeration, often in a fairly droll way.   When I'm in company I like to be the life of the party. But I've learnt to tone it down a lot as I've gotten older - I've learnt how to cue other people in to allow them to shine; and I've learnt the awesome power of shutting up and listening to other people. The true power of charm is allowing other people to charm you :)  But your friend hasn't learnt that yet, so he is the all-singing all-dancing Amuse-a-Tron :)  So perhaps what will help is to ask yourself - why do you ""really dislike"" people who brag/exaggerate and seek attention ? Why is that a problem for you ? Have you had to compete with an attention seeking sibling or friend ?   Because in the end, its fairly harmless behaviour. He's not malicious or spiteful - he just wants people to like him, so he puts on a show for them.  Attention seeking people just want.... attention. Its not a terrible thing, nor is it so hard to give it to them.  To me it sounds as though you think he's being ""fake"" to impress a group of new friends. Maybe he is :) But unless he's doing it by putting other people down or by being mean, then what harm is it to you ?  If he's a good friend, then empathise with his desire to look good in front of others, without feeling that its some terrible character flaw."

And while he can have a good reason for bragging or constantly exaggerating, I really don't care about it. And how can I be able to not care? I don't know.    Everything don't have reason, and everything don't need a reason. I don't try to understand everything, every word people say, every action they make, basically everything around me, I just ""go with the flow"". If I'm comfortable and/or happy with the people around me, the rest doesn't really matter. Of course I care about the people I like, and after some time knowing them, I understand them more than the day I met them for the first time, but I don't force these things. If something is important, if they want to share something, to let me know something, eventually, and naturally, I'll know it.    It's my point of view, I know that people may think differently, and sometimes I was said that I'm ""too laid-back"", ""passive"" or that ""I don't care about anything"". I care about things, but in my own way. I don't think I'm good at giving advice, the best I can do his to give my opinion and hoping that it'll inspire something, or at least open the dialogue to new perspectives, so if you're looking for answers, I'm sorry but I'm not the right person."
ENFP,3al05r,xvose,3,Sun Jun 21 05:57:27 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents:  So I've been struggling with anxiety for the past two years and it's really taken it's toll on me. It runs in the family, somehow we're just weak as shit, and after trying to put it off for a while, I started taking antidepressants to help combat my fears. And guess what I've learned a shit ton. At first the anxiety was too invasive for me to keep a level head, so I could not learn. But once the antidepressants took the worst edge off of it, I managed to really get to it, in the most ENFP sort of way imaginable. I just barged right into it. Scared of losing? Fucking lose anyways and celebrate the loss with friends. Scared of going on a date? Fucking go anyways, and tell her you're a bit shaky cause of nerves. Whatever the example, I found that 9 out of 10 times, people will understand, and help you out. Even on dates! In fact, usually people only liked me more for being open and honest with them. So I guess what it all comes down to is that you need to learn that fear itself is not negative. Your reaction to it is. Learn to like the feeling of being afraid, or at least learn to see its merits.  Tl:dr I never lose. Either I win, or I learn."

And when someone's damaged me in some way, even if I hold no ill will toward them in any regard, I just can't trust them enough to spill my guts."

ENFP,3akddo,JeremiahKassin,3,Sun Jun 21 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"I can keep a small space organized IF and only if it is actually ergonomically laid out to match my routine. Hence, if I tend to do all my art spread out on the floor in the living room, then the living room must keep storage for the art supplies.   There's a few more things that go with this beyond setting up shop where the piles naturally go:    Whatever storage I use for my things must be perfect sized. If it is too small, there is not a place to put all the things and they will spill out. If it is too big, then things that don't belong will start getting crammed in there, only to be lost.  The storage must be attractive. If it's cool with my aesthetic, I'll actually use it. If it's a plastic bin, I'll have an urge to hide it, which means it'll no longer be close to where I actually use it, which means I'll never put shit back. Open shelving and containers work a little better for me. I like to see all the things at once, to know exactly what I've got. It makes the stuff easier to be at hand. Really, the less steps something takes to use, the better. It should be damn near instinctual.

ENFP,3akddo,landingshortly,2,Mon Jun 22 23:52:45 2015 UTC,"I am about to master it. HAH! I am so damn proud of myself because I love to show myself that I can be better than myself and THIS has been my nemesis for all my life so far.    My fiancee told me she hated it that our flat is always chaotic. She is a bit chaotic and I am as well but I never cared about it because, hey, it's me and I love myself. She hated it because she would never ask someone to come over to our place... and I thought ""Whatever...""    Then we decided to move and I just finished playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I loved the style of the game and I researched into Cyberpunk. Then Minimalism. Then why I love looking at clean, unclutterd rooms... and I found out that it really calms me down. So I got into this concept of functionalism and minimalism that's not only visually pleasing but also so well-designed in terms of usability.    This led to me, giving away or throwing away all the things that I did not love or did not need. I ended up with 100 pieces of clothes (including shoes, belts, ties,...), my laptop and a bit more but you get the idea. I reduced my belongings to a minimum in order to not having to think about them. This led to less stuff laying around, less cluttered wardrobes, more space, ROOM TO BREATHE (!), floors that aren't full with clothes you have to step on in order to move, desks where I can sit and immediately do something (eat, write,...) and not having to clean up before! ... ah I LOVE it.    TLDR: The less stuff you own, the easier you organize.    Also: Try to read Mari Kondo's The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing. She takes it to an extreme level but parts of it are really clever."
ENFP,3akddo,SeductivePillowcase,2,Mon Jun 22 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"I love functionalism and minimalism. Partly, I think this is because I'm trying to avoid becoming a hoarder like my parents. I often have the urge to buy/keep things because I just NEED them, but I've been able to become more realistic and cut sentimental ties with stuff. Anything that is more inconvenient than useful goes. My so is very sentimental about his things, though. He still keeps binders from high school.  I will read that book, though. Thank you!"
ENFP,3akddo,_bonafide,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds a bit similar to my situation. My parents are also hoarders... they even bring back tea bags from their hotel rooms when they come home from their vacations. My SO is also quite sentimental about things but that's OK. At first, when I went cold turkey on stuff that I don't need or love, she was super sceptical. When we moved, she had like 6 times more moving boxes than me.    BUT I am really glad that I made her understand that our materialistic lifestyle is actually keeping us from doing/buying the things we really want. She has so many still unused clothes in her wardrobe where the price tag is still on. Sure, some of the things only cost 5€ ... but it sums up and even 5€ is too much if you do not use it. It sums up to so much in the long-term that one could easily take a long vacation with the money, buy a good card, go and eat out from time to time... it's ultimately more worth it than always buying new stuff. So I also got her to de-clutter her wardrobe and stuff she owns because everything we don't use does not pay any rent while living under my roof without working.    She did not really like the idea at first but when I told her that I will not force her to do anything but it would be helping me to stay more tidy if she only followed one principle: If you do not love or need it, don't get it/throw it away. She liked that because I am not forcing her to do anything she does not want and she's got to keep everything she loves or needs.    If your SO loves her binders from high school... well... I guess you cannot make her give them away. It's part of her and you should embrace it. If she's just keeping it for the sake of it... well, you can work with that. :)"

I go into Jabba The Hut mode and just do whatever I want. Maybe shower or take a nap.   The schedule itself is highly flexible. But the main reason I like to keep it is because I'd rather do things my way than someone else's way.

ENFP,3ak86z,Massticles,3,Sun Jun 21 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"Hehehe. I think that my fiancee is an INTJ.    Here is our weird but sweet story. I started at this firm where she worked at. It was the market leader and she was working there for 4 years already while I came in as the former star of a smaller company. Naturally, I was all bubbly and also quite proud and she used to look at me with arrogance. Later on she would confess to me that she hated my guts because she thought that I was dumb on the inside and all talk on the outside.    When we worked late hours, she would even avoid going for a cigarette with me when I asked her and went alone. BUT I found her cute, a bit mysterious because I could not look through her and her thoughts.    So months went by and I soon had quite a lot of friends at the company. Even her co-workers liked me and while she would still not actively engage with me, she was at least not as negative as in the beginning. She would still not re-add me on Facebook although all of her friends did... ;) ... so at one point when it was her birthday, I thought that this arrogant little brat needed something sweet and while she was eating lunch, I got a blueberry muffin for her, placed it on her desk with a candle and a sweet little post-it that I wished her a happy birthday.    Apparently, I was the only one at the office who gave her a present and she added me... :) when I posed on FB that I am down because I forgot my headphones at home, she just silently walked over and lent me hers. Then I decided to leave the company and do something else... and she took a few weeks off because work was too stressful. I was in the midst of my vacation when I heard and asked her on FB if she's alright and... we wrote a lot. She finally got to see that I cared about her without any grain of bad intentions, that I was not as dumb as she thought.... quite contrary... well-respected by everyone as one of the big brains... and the rest is history.    This was 2 years ago. I started to fall for her, she could not bring herself to admit it that she liked me too... I told her that I did not care about her not being able to admit it to herself and she gave in because I can look just right through her. And yeah... we moved in together a month ago (she lived at my place before!), we got 4 little sweet bunnies and I asked her to marry me a month ago. :) She's the one.    Every time our paths crossed, we collided... ok... she wanted to put her fist in my face and I wanted to cuddle with her... =) but we came out stronger than before. I could convince her that I am the total opposite from her prejudices about me. I got the chess player to abandon the chess board and have some fun with the bunnies. And I taught her how to love and be loved... how to behave in a relationship... how to give and take... and we have the best harmony I have ever witnessed.    Whenever we fight, we find solutions. She works on them and I do as well. We could not imagine not being together."
ENFP,3ak86z,landingshortly,2,Mon Jun 22 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of INTJ friends. The only memorable relationship I've encountered this sort of friction, well...she treated me like I was stupid, beneath her, and embarrassing to be seen with. She treated everyone else in our class like that as well, and had a hard time getting along with anyone. Eventually, she either became lonely in the class, or realized that working on the wards is so demanding that it's impossible to survive (or get the grades you need) without promoting a pleasant atmosphere, so she softened a little. I continued to be cordial to her, and I think that she believed that to mean that I thought highly of her, but we never became friends.  I respect her on a professional level. Socially, I'm completely apathetic.   My other INTJ friends typically go through a period where they quietly examine me from a distance, until they decide that I am worth their trust. Then we have lots of late night chats. There's no conflict unless we end up in a romantic relationship way down the line and break up.  So...on your end, how many XNFPs data points are making your graph?"

Because each of these mean very different things to me. One sounds like a lot of people to someone who isn't very social but isn't very many interactions. The other is glaring.  Additionally, there's probably some sticking point where your ENFPs got upset with you. It probably wasn't the honesty. Honesty is not a bad thing. Without a specific example, I'm don't know whether to assume that there was some innocent misunderstanding about your need for alone time vs their extroversion, or if you were offering unsolicited opinions and told them that they don't know how to live their lives, and that they look ugly in their favorite outfit while backing it up with ""What? I'm just being honest."" before they can even make sense of what just happened.  This is the internet. Don't make me guess your situation, or I will fuck it up. Worse than you could ever imagine.

They sought that independence by giving the finger to society every single day and engaging in behavior that was toxic and destructive.   In college though, I found myself still drawn to the same type of guy, but the ones who used their powers for good, so to speak.

I've thought long and hard about money and every time I do it leads me to thoughts of why it exists, which comes to the conclusion of ""easy trading"" a common ground where you can have access to everything you need. To be able to provide a service that grants you access to a resource that is commonly needed so you don't have to wait for people to need your service to make a trade.  For instance; you repair fridges and you need apples for lunch. The problem is the man with apples doesn't need his fridge repaired, so then the trade cannot be made. So currency acts as the middle ground. (not a very thorough example but I'm far to excited to go into detail)  Now for where i stand with money(currency). I stand pretty closely with you on this one. Just enough for me and my partner to live comfortably, to cover both of our needs. Access to the things you have stated in your post ofcourse.   Where we differ is; I would put left over money into savings to see us through any ""acts of nature"" that would leave us unable to provide, a safety net or peace of mind if you will.  I also see as over spending on things as silly as well. i always measure quality to cost. I'm happy to spend more if its going to provide better quality; last longer, provide longer ect.  I have no ambitions to be rolling in money and throwing it at senseless random things to gain satisfaction. I get my happiness from the people around me and their happiness.  Some say they are building a legacy... Must be something to do with their personality, because my legacy is my family.   there is more i can say but i would be rambling from here."
ENFP,3aieyr,LeExtrovert,4,Sat Jun 20 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"I'm currently reading a book called: The Millionaire Next Door and it's a super cool book that talks about what separates the wealthy from the non wealthy. What's super interesting is that the people you'd think are wealthy (those who live in upscale neighborhoods, drive luxury cars, etc.) usually aren't, but are instead high income spenders (people who make a lot of money and spend a lot of money). Most of the millionaires are self-made, live in middle class neighborhoods, and don't drive luxury cars or have expensive items.   .  To me, personally I believe it's important that I become financially independent in life. Meaning that I have no debt, and I can look after myself if something goes wrong without having to borrow money from anyone. It's one of my major goals in life to not have any debt and to live well below my means. However, I do believe money is very important if I want to have the lifestyle I want to live (ex: gym membership, good health, etc.). I believe that if I'm smart and careful with my money, I can probably meet most of my standards without having to spend a lot of money. I still think wealth building is a very important thing, especially in this day and age where the economy is constantly changing, I believe it's a good thing to be financially prepared for whatever happens. So say if, God forbid something terrible happens, and I have to immediately restart my life somewhere else immediately, I want to be ready to make that impulse. Or if I or someone I know gets into an accident and needs cash, I can just bust out the Benjamin's and be like ""Aye, yo, Frankie's got u darlin"" and there wouldn't be as much stress involved with paying bills or anything. I probably wouldn't be buying new cars every year or anything like that, I'd only purchase stuff that I know for sure I'd use and that will last a very long time.

On the other hand, I'm a real tight-ass when it comes to actually spending my money. I'll be willing to shell out more for food and medicine, but I'm a total cheapskate on almost everything else.

Basically, I want to have wealth. I don't want a brand new car or a six bedroom house or a boat, but not having to worry about money or if I'll get another job would be dreamy. Money is basically freedom. I like to travel, I like to go to nice restaurants, I like to be able to afford to treat my friends and boyfriend, I like to buy ethically sourced clothing and free range eggs, and I like being able to donate money to the SPCA or rescue efforts like Nepal. I'm responsible with my money and so I'm able to do the things I like, in moderation, and I make sure keep a decent chunk of savings because it gives me security.  Money isn't bad and it's not a negative trait to like having it.

ENFP,3aenmc,ActualShipDate,7,Fri Jun 19 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"Holy crap.  I am literally going through this right now too.  Sent a text to a guy saying ""Hey how are you doing?"".  I see that he saw it (on FB Messenger) and totally ignored it.  In the next 3 hours he proceeded to share some links... I took that as him saying ""I'm purposefully ignoring your message, look at me posting and ignoring you"".  It pretty much ruined the rest of my day, I couldn't stop obsessing about it.   I learned two lessons from it:  1) I don't really like him as much as I thought I liked him.  I don't tolerate careless disrespect, you don't treat your friends like that.  So he kind of did me a favor by liberating me from that attraction because he showed his true colors.   2) It made me remember how many messages I have gotten from others that I have carelessly ignored.  I'm always in constant communication with a lot of people, and I have ignored good friends because I meant to get back to them but forgot.  I have ignored family members too because I simply didn't have time to respond or reach out.  And damn does it hurt.  So it's humbling, really.  I remembered that I hate to be treated like this, and I need to stop doing it to others.  I have a loooooot of reaching out to do now, I need to make sure my friends and family know I care about them and apologize for my careless behavior.   Also, the need to be in constant communication with a lot of people is completely normal, so stop beating yourself up about it. To me, it's an indication of an active and developed mind, my neural networks wanting to network with other neural networks, to freely flow information, in and out.  It's a beautiful thing!

Just because someone isn't responding immediately doesn't mean they're not interested, though this could very well be the case, it could be that they're just too busy to respond. To alleviate this problem, communicate your needs. If the dude is a sensitive type, use some tact otherwise just be straight up honest. Me?

Sometimes it's good not to get what it is you think that you want :)  I broke up with a guy after five dates because he spent a whole day to respond to a nice picture text I sent him. Deep down I knew I needed more attention than that. (Was subsequently depressed for 2 weeks, asked him out again, dated for 3 months, broke up and then spent 3 months being depressed - SO - please trust yourself that you really know what you want).   Maybe you're not even ready for a relationship...it's a big commitment and I know you would go balls to the wall for someone just good enough - try and hold out for what it is you really want.

ENFP,3aha23,vespria,2,Mon Jun 22 06:00:43 2015 UTC,"There are a number of ways you can go over this.  Firstly, assuming you want to maintain a healthy / good relationship with these guys then confront them in the house and ask why they're being acting out in the workplace. Also, more importantly, regardless of boy / girl gender, the fact is they're not doing their job and you're going to tell them to do it.  If they still don't comply, you're going to have to put your foot down. Regardless of the advice given here, I'm assuming your main problem is clearly that you don't want to hurt these guys or seem over demanding and would rather assume a peaceful position. But alas, this is life and this is the workplace, you're going to have to put your foot down and basically demand they do their work because it is totally unacceptable. They're hired to do their work, not mock around and be idiots.   Lastly, this is management. That means it boils down to you on managing them rather than going to your superior officer or whatever. When your superior officer positioned you as their boss, they assumed you could take responsibility and manage these guys to do their work, rather than relying on them to do it for you.  So yeah, its all your choice of course. You can continue being nice and passive about it. Or calmly and try to rationally discuss it with them without taking their comments personally.   Good Luck"
ENFP,3aha23,LatinBeef,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"I'm ENFP with ENTP tendencies while I'm at work, so maybe I can help. First, who picks up the slack when they don't do their jobs? If it's you, than you need to get out of this spiral fast. If it's someone else, tell them not to do it, it is so-and-so's job. Do you have the option of communicating the expectations you have of them via email? If so you need to get on that ASAP. Having these written down is integral to holding them accountable. If they tell you no in person, and refuse to respond to your email, forward the same email, with a message at the top stating ""I need your response ASAP, because without your response, I am under the impression you are unavailable to do this task."" This leaves you with two possible outcomes: 1) They do their Jobs (unlikely.) 2) They ignore you, and you now have all you need to get managements attention. Under no circumstances should you delegate this work that you have assigned them or someone else (including yourself.) If number 2 is indeed the case, you need to send a third email, this time CCing you superiors, containing something like this (all of the while making sure copies of the previous emails are at the bottom): I have reached out to you (don't put them in the same email, make sure these emails are separate or you will for sure have HR problems) in person, and via email several times to complete _______ tasks. Unfortunately, these tasks have to somehow slipped under your radar. As a team, I want to make sure everyone involved has clear instructions to succeed, and have access to everything they need to complete their assigned tasks. This means that if you are still unsure of what is required, please reach out to me via email. I'm sure this was a simple miscommunication, but I would like to avoid these issues arise in the future.  Best Reguards, Sign  Now from here they can play a few cards. However, they can't pretend you weren't clear (unless they want to look like idiots to management, and risk getting let go: the proof is in the email), they can't blame anyone else (even you), because you fulfilled your delegation duty to the fullest extent, and they can't fake being clueless anymore. However, they can pretend they never saw their emails and you lied about talking to them, but once they make that claim, they will look irresponsible to your superiors, and will likely be told to check their email in the future. If they ignore your email again, it just further discredits them. If they choose to suck up to management, just keep doing the same thing. From what it sounds like, management doesn't care, or is preoccupied. This means that the more you send them these messages, the more attention they will have to pay, and as is often the case, the more annoyance they will experience. Also make a point to write a follow up email after every conversation you have with them in person too, mentioning everything discussed in person, so their claims of not talking to you look less valid over time. Keep it up, even if it seems tedious. Whatever you do, keep on letting those jobs go undone. Now it's a waiting game.

The first was the constantly wondering what other people were thinking and trying to analyze the shit out of them. See, I was just your typical teenager and I really wanted to know if people liked me. Or were attracted to me. Or found me annoying. Whatever. So I'd read into everything, ask too many questions at all the wrong times, push for more info. Hoping to find that piece of info that would comfort my own insecurities.    Except I realized that the more aggressive I was, the more people would close up and give me less information. The more I analyzed someone I was emotionally invested in (AKA everyone) the more I'd fuck it up and get it wrong.   But if I just let people be comfortable, reserved my judgments until they told me what was going on inside, I got more information, and I never had one of my false assumptions hit me in the ass. Because I wasn't making any assumptions. It wasn't easy to accept that people have the right to give what they want, and that completely trumps my personal curiosity. At first you feel a little down trodden knowing that, and then it brings you peace. Because you're no longer ruminating on what they think.   Of course that didn't stop the constant self checking and revisiting conversations, coming up with the perfect line that Oh, I just should have said!   That I got ride of after having a particularly intense dream where I was visited by a man who told me he was giving me a gift and sent me back to middle school to restart my life. So a good 7 years. And Being that I had the social skills of a 19 year old, I easily got along with people, was making friends, and I lived out the first day of school all the way to the bus ride home into that crappy rental we used to live in. Then I got on my bed and started feeling depressed as hell that I couldn't see all the people I knew in college...and further depressed that even if I waited 7 years, went to the same school, I would not be able to enact that life exactly. Since a lot of them I met by random, I'd never met them again.  I just got so depressed, felt so trapped, and I started panicking until I woke up, in my dorm room, with my life back. And I was so thankful the whole thing was a dream, I really felt like I had been given a gift.   I stopped ruminating over the past after that. What is done is done. Because I have plenty of things I love in this world today, and they came to me from the entire mix of negative and positive actions in my life. You can't redo the bad stuff and still keep the good stuff you've got. You just take it.   Anyway, those were my experiences. I still have stuff I struggle with, but at least I've found peace with those  two subjects."

Over the course of about a year I had a LOT of stuff happen, and I kept not dealing with it. Eventually I just kind of broke, and ended up with panic attacks and some pretty heavy anxiety.

ENFP,3afjb8,jaegerbombs,3,Fri Jun 19 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be a sophomore in college and I have been on an antidepressant since the sixth grade.   Now there are three main categories of antidepressants: newer reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs and TeCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).   In all likelihood, your doctor will put you on a reuptake inhibitor. See, your brain has something called the synaptic gap and the synaptic clefts. The presynaptic cleft releases neurotransmitters (which are types of chemicals that the brain uses for communicating with itself and other parts of the body), the neurotransmitters cross the synaptic gap and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cleft. This binding action causes electrical impulses to be sent to other parts of the brain or body. Eventually, these neurotransmitters will unbind and be reabsorbed by the presynaptic cleft; this is called reuptake. Reuptake inhibitors work by blocking neurotransmitters from being reabsorbed into the presynaptic cleft. This will cause more neurotransmitters to accumulate in the synaptic gap, thus increasing the likelihood and quantity of neurotransmitters binding to receptors on the postsynaptic cleft. This mechanism seems to reverse depressive symptoms, as well as anxious symptoms (although the anti-anxiety (anxiolytic) effect depends on the type of reuptake inhibitor being used).   There are three major types of reuptake inhibitors: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), and Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors (NDRIs). SSRIs influence the action of serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of well-being and possibly happiness. SSRIs are the most calming out of the three reuptake inhibitor classes which makes them an excellent choice for people with comorbid depression and anxiety. SNRIs, on the other hand, act on a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine as well as on serotonin. Norepinephrine is essentially the precursor of adrenaline and it is associated with alertness, energy, sociability, and focus. From what I know, SNRIs are typically excellent for people who are depressed, although these drugs seem to be relatively ineffective at treating most forms of anxiety. Finally, we come to the NDRIs. These drugs act on norepinephrine and dopamine, the latter of which is associated with learning, motivation, sociability, happiness, alertness, aggression, and focus. NDRIs are typically very effective at treating depression by itself, although they can only treat one anxiety disorder (social anxiety disorder) and have the possibility of worsening other anxiety disorders (namely OCD).   The side effects of reuptake inhibitors vary, but there are a few common ones: weight change (increase in SSRIs, decrease in NDRIs, and either/or in SNRIs), headache, rapid pulse, diarrhea and/or constipation, dizziness, sweating, and xerostomia (dry mouth). SSRIs and, to a lesser degree, SNRIs may cause sexual dysfunction; conversely, NDRIs have the potential to increase sex drive. These side effects are most likely to begin during the first few weeks of treatment; after that, your body will adjust to the medication and, as such, its side effects will either vanish or lessen in intensity.   Of course, reuptake inhibitors may not be the most effective drug class for you. In that case, your doctor would probably put you on a TCA or TeCA antidepressant. In essence, tricyclic antidepressants are molecules with three atomic rings and tetracyclic antidepressants are molecules with four atomic rings. For the sake of simplicity, let's just focus on TCAs. TCAs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine; in the case aminetpine, dopamine reuptake is also inhibited. TCAs, while effective, are used less frequently than modern reuptake inhibitors because they tend to cause more severe side effects, have a lower safety index (meaning that an overdose could easily prove to be fatal, whereas modern reuptake inhibitors are less likely to cause a fatality in the event of overdose) and interact with more drugs. However, if used correctly, TCAs can be safe and effective. If you're unlucky enough to resist reuptake inhibitor and TCA treatments, your doctor may put you on a MAOI. You see, there is a chemical in the brain known as monoamine oxidase; it breaks down serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, amongst other neurotransmitters. As the name suggests, MAOIs work by inactivating monoamine oxidase, thus leading to an increase in the abundance of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. IMO, MAOIs are the most effective antidepressants on the market. Alas, MAOIs are rather unsafe. Their side effect profile is almost as wide as the sky and they are extremely reactive to other drugs. Taking OTC cough syrup with a MAOI could cause you to develop a rare but potentially fatal syndrome and eating a substance called tyramine (found in cheeses, meats, and certain wines) could cause your heart to fucking explode.   Just bear one thing in mind: antidepressants work on moderate to severe depression; studies have shown that antidepressants have little effect on mild depression. If your depression is mild (and even if it isn't), I'd suggest making a few lifestyle changes.   1.] Get a consistent sleep cycle. I know that it isn't always possible to get eight hours of sleep per night and that it isn't always possible to wake up or go to sleep at the same times. However, doing your best to consistently get anywhere from 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night can do wonders for one's mood. It's hard to be happy when you're exhausted, right?   2.] Exercise. You don't have to go out and get fucking jacked; even taking a thirty minute walk three or four times a week could help. Hell, one study found that regular exercise could potentially be as effective as antidepressant therapy.   3.] Eat regularly and eat healthy. I suppose it's a case of 'you are what you eat;' eating healthy food makes you feel good and eating junk food makes you feel like shit. I'm not saying that you can never have a soda (except for diet; that shit can potentially make you even more depressed) or an entire deep dish pizza again; just make sure to eat them in moderation.   4.] Talk. Family, friends, priests or pastors, doctors; talking to someone you trust can really help you feel better. I know that my depression resurfaces when I keep my feelings bottled up inside and that it just as quickly dissipates if I just talk to someone and feel like they're listening. Seriously, it's amazing how much sharing your burdens with someone else can help.   5.] Try something new! I'd suggest this for any type, but this is especially true for ExxP types. That dominant extraverted perceiving function requires novelty; depriving yourself of that probably won't do you much good. Ever wanted to go fishing? Then buy some gear and get a friend or the Internet to teach you how to fish! You could learn a new language, try painting or photography, write, play an instrument, eat at a restaurant you've never been to before... The list goes on.   6.] Challenge your negative thought patterns. If your brain calls you a fucking piece of shit and you agree with it, you'll feel like a fucking piece of shit. If your brain calls you a fucking piece of shit and you challenge that statement with the truth, well, you won't feel as bad as you could've.   Look, depression can get better. I'd suggest getting treatment sooner rather than later, as prolonged depressive episodes are harder to treat. And you are not alone. Estimates place the number of depressed people on this planet at 350 million. I've been there many times before. It sucks and it feels like it'll never get better. It literally feels like you're at the base of Mt. Everest and that you have to climb it. But you take a step up. Then another. Then another. The progress is painfully slow and excruciatingly hard at first. But it's progress none the less; as you build up momentum, it will become easier and easier for you to climb up until you're on the top of the mountain taking a freedom piss.   Stay strong, whoever you are."

Only thing to add (and this is tiny), is that if you're having trouble with point 6 on your own, challenging negative thought patterns is the basis for cognitive behavioral therapy. That's the buzz word that you use, when you're searching for resources.   There are both work books that are sold on this, and many therapists are trained in this.

It was in combination with severe anxiety attacks, and there was not much I could do. But I had always the hope that I would be completely free sometime.  It had to do with a lot of hurtfull circumstances from my youth. I had to face and work trough the pain, accept repressed emotions (which I didn't knew I even had), and keep working on myself. There was a lot of repressed anger in my case, which by repressing I fooled myself to think that I could save relationships which where beyond saving, and in which I had the complete right to be angry. I had to accept my emotional side again, which felt foreign but familiar. After a long time I do have the capacity again to be happy, and have so much energy, that I need to be aware of the energy level of my body, and take enough sleep. :)   That doesn't mean that medicine doesn't work, but it has to go together with serious effort of the mind and a healthy behaviour.

I cry at movies, I just got my nails painted eggplant purple, my favorite color is pink, I'm submissive in kink, and I have luxurious curls down to my shoulder blades. I can also bench more than my body weight, trend towards loud extroversion, and have a chest hairy enough to be reasonably considered a ""pelt"". I'm glad most women don't see me as the ideal male: for them, I'm not, and I don't want to date them anyway! I just need attraction with the very few people who will actually become great and healthy partners in my life.

This attitude got me a girlfriend by totally random chance on a hitch hiking trip (whom I sometimes still consider way out of my league), and we're travelling together now for over a year, going from country to country, living in communities in Berlin and Barcelona, in caves on Tenerife, in squats in Amsterdam, etcetera.

I'm only interested in making a genuine connection. Maybe I'm just being picky, I don't know. I tend to be like that with most things. I'm like a lightswitch, and most people are dimmers.

ENFP,3abump,Jemarqus_07,2,Thu Jun 18 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"I agree about choosing to put your feelings on stage instead of jeeping them behind the scenes.  However, to OP's question about struggles, id say one of mine is more so knowing when its fruitful to share my feelings and who to be open with. I'm fortunate to have friends who I'm comfortable discussing everything that goes on in my head, both dark and light. I think that's what a genuine connection is to me.  But, I also know that there are times when I've shared too much too early, and times when I've actually been painfully needy.   I'd consider it a game of finding who i can trust and when.  I also try to recognize when im vulnerable and may need to temper what i say, so that im not spilling my emotions on everyone's nice new friendship rug.   As far as passing up on women, i know in the past its not so much that i was picky, but i either pursued unrealistic goals with women, or was impatient and tried to push too fast. At the time, these translated to me as ""can't make a connection"".   Do you think your in the same boat?"
ENFP,3abump,JeremiahKassin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:29:07 2015 UTC,"I've had that problem in the past. Being able to tell if a person was trustworthy at a glance, I'd overshare, and that person not knowing me, they'd wonder why someone they considered a stranger was telling them personal things. They usually assumed I was socially inept, or trying to manipulate them. I went through a few years of withdrawal and depression before I figured it out.  Now, though, it's more about a lack of selection where I'm at. I've finally figured the game out. There's a few things I need to finish up for completion's sake. Moving is just NewGamePlus."
ENFP,3abump,Vaild_desires,7,Fri Jun 19 12:43:12 2015 UTC,"I think being a a straight, male ENFP is difficult because we are so radically different from the idea of the stereotypical guy. We talk about feelings, do goofy on the regular, and don't really buy into the concept of the male ego. I think the last reason in particular is why we tend to get away with women so well.   Since we don't try to emulate what people inherently consider normal, we are left to figure out on are own what truly makes us who we are. In theory this sounds like a lovely way to be, until you realize that lots of people vilify you for not conforming to the way they think and act, or for not being normal and being ""weird"". And to be perfectly candid, there are some days where I wish I could just stop trying to be true to who think I am and just be a cookie cutter ""Dude"". I would strip my personality and all my life goals to revolve around getting bitches and getting high.   But what fun would that be? ;)"

I can't tell you the number of times I've had a mob out front ready to (metaphorically) raze my castle. I just invite them in for milk and cookies, talk it out with them with a good ""we're not so different, you and I"" speech, and they go on their way.

I really wished you lived in a real dope ass castle that you would design by hand to be unrazeable.  On a more serious note I think the main reason people secretly is because most people don't put forth an effort to understand you. That would take precious time out of their day, so instead they act dismissive and judgmental. Plus it's just more convenient for some people to be dismissive and judgmental than to be understanding and accepting. And if you we've learned one thing from society today, it's that convenience is everything."

And then I get over the feelings very quickly after taking forever to think them through to understand the feelings and by the time they respond I am completely over it. I think it's a combination of low attention span/disregard for it and feeling too vulnerable. And also this: (u/jeremiahkassin)    I can come off as needy. I don't think I'm much more needy than the average man, I just convey it when I feel it instead of putting on a stoic face.   I relate so hard to this. I guess ENFPs are more  willing to embrace their feelings and face them because we think it through internally? Or perhaps Fi means being honest to oneself so in the case of an ENFP it's important to us we don't just hide what we feel because we have to be manly because society and that's the same for INTJ females when they're not ""feeling""?

I challenged my thinking, broke off contact with a horndog dude and feel amazing.  Suddenly I've quit smoking, hit the gym and feel like doing better. My point is you may not have met many open-minded women with regard to gender roles, but they're out there.   It might help that I live near L.A. So petty much everyone is liberal/progressive around me.   But don't stress over the masculine/feminine labels dude. The best women consider you as a whole human.

I guess it just frustrates me a bit sometimes, being capable of loving people immensely and dearly, but not enough to be able to entertain the thought of something more than friendship (FWB, platonic, you name it). It feels like I've really missed out on something that so many others almost take for granted, haha. I don't want to miss out on cool stuff!"
ENFP,3ad89b,PuzzlePirate,2,Fri Jun 19 13:21:05 2015 UTC,"Love as it's protrayed in the movies tends to confuse limerence with the quiet, stable love that grows over a life time.   I don't really fall into limerence much anymore. But if I spend enough time with someone, I will grow to love and respect them. I'm ok with that. I'm still able to commit to them.   And I feel comfortable committing to someone sexually, because I really don't like to have sex with anyone I don't feel completely safe with. Or anyone who isn't invested in a mutual experience. It's difficult for me to find that outside of a relationship. Not to mention, sex gets better over time, when we learn each other's bodies and feel comfortable enough to express our own desires. I also get a lot out of making my partner happy. So if they're most comfortable in a monogamous relationship, sounds great! I've never dated someone who didn't want a non monogamous relationship, so I still haven't given it serious thought if it's something I demand or not. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.    Of course, I'll never be able to get all of my emotional intimacy needs met by one person. I require a net work. So finding the right person means that I need to find someone who is not the jealous type, and is comfortable with me venturing off to spend a fair amount of time with friends. They need to have their own independent things going on to make up for that.   I don't know, I'm pretty chill when it comes to relationships, because my desire to make my partner happy typically trumps my own. Not saying it's healthier or not, it's just the way it is.   I've got a few friends that have tried open relationships and I'd say that my thoughts are this: The mature ones communicate and seem to be doing just fine. They're also not possessive over their partner. While they enjoy the experience of sex, they're more about sharing. They're not just trying to gobble up attention.  The immature ones keep it vague and eventually start twisting the truth to avoid communication. They push their luck until the relationships they have rot from the inside out, and once that pus pushes to the surface, it bursts forth and is out of control. They tend to be petty, jealous, and are motivated to keep relationships open so that they can keep their attention revenue streams flowing. They're generally oblivious to their partners needs.   Open relationships are a real possibility if you feel that you will never be satisfied by one partner. How well it works is going to depend on the mentality you've got regarding why you want more than one."
ENFP,3acgpp,xafterthought,3,Thu Jun 18 23:53:21 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, aside from the relationship. I'm in love with an unattainable woman, and had to walk away from a lot of people I care about to escape her gravity. But I've come to a resolution. I'm leaving. I'm going to save up some money, and I'm moving clear across the country to start over. I haven't decided where I'm going to wind up, exactly, but I've got some ideas. I probably won't have a job when I leave. I won't know anyone where I'm going. But, compared to the drudgery of life as it's been, those challenges aren't just exciting. They're comforting.  It sounds like you can't do that. So think about what you can change, and change what you can. Sometimes just rearranging the furniture is enough to end a funk. Sometimes you need to take a step back, evaluate where you're at, and ask if you're really going where you want to go in life. I know I wasn't. So I'm making the changes that need to be made. That just happens to be nearly everything."
ENFP,3acgpp,JeremiahKassin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:00:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely relevant. Part of it is I've had a lot of loss in my life, and I'm having trouble deciphering all of it. I know that SOMETHING is wrong, but I haven't been able to home in on it. Part of it might be that I lost the one person that was like me and who I could relate to. But some of it also feels like there's a better way to live life than to work 40 hours a week. Flip side tho:  There's a shit ton of people that would kill to have jobs. So IDK. I feel both unsatisfied and guilty for being unsatisfied. Probably, I'm just upset at losing my person and the rest feels shitty as a result."
ENFP,3acgpp,JeremiahKassin,2,Fri Jun 19 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe that's what you need to change. Losing. People. Sucks. And I've been through that SO MUCH over the last few years. I'm fed up, and that's part of the reason I'm starting over. After losing so many, and knowing I'm going to have to start from scratch again, I at least can feel like I'm doing it on my own terms this time. And part of the move is strategic, too. I'm considering areas of the country that are more in line with my political and religious convictions, hoping that'll open up the dating pool for me a little more.  But, back to how any of this is relevant to what you're going through. If you've lost someone, meet more someones. No, you probably can't replace the person you've lost. It's really unlikely anyone can fill that same niche in your life. But relationships are awesomely organic, and new, healthy friendships work well to cover heartache. Ever tried meetup.com? It's worked for me before. But it's not hard for us to get out there and meet people. Check out local event papers. Do stuff, and suck more people in with your mighty vortex of charisma! You won't forget your loss, but it's good medicine for the pain."

One thing I always relate to is music for my focus. I play one song that's not too catchy, very mellow and put it on repeat. I have a tendency to dislike studying / doing assignments at home since I've established in my mind that home = relax, so therefore cafe = GSD (Get shit done). Put on some earphones and tune out for a couple hours, but be sure to recharge with some social interaction. I usually go for about 2-3 hours, then hit someone up and grab a bite to eat. Studying with a buddy helps too but beware. Our extroversion usually gets us into a playful mood and we will mess it all up.  That being said I wish it was like this all the time. I fall prey to simply giving 0 fucks and doing it last minute. It's hard, but we can do it!"
ENFP,3adjnn,Antonyfl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:47:24 2015 UTC,"This.

ENFP,3adjnn,xafterthought,2,Fri Jun 19 10:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand this completely. I actually had this exact thing happen to me when I was in college. What I did was shut down everything that could be a distraction. No Social Media. Make a list of all the stuff you have to do for your assignments. For me, it helps to start with easiest and work my way up to the hardest. By accomplishing a few small things, you start to gain momentum, and continuing doesn't feel as bad.  The other thing I do is make it a challenge to myself. I started using toggl.com to track how long things take me, and when I actually see the minutes ticking away on the timer, it motivates me to get shit done quicker. My most productive days have been when I was like ""I bet I can get this done in 7 minutes"", and then I start toggl and try to do it."

As an INTJ I abhor menial tasks, they bore me so much so that I will lose my focus and end up doing something else, this is a massive detriment towards my current projects at work.   Focus. Focus. Focus. One thing at a time. Work through it systematically and scratch them off the list one assignment at a time.

She might mean what she says, but she doesn't mean the emotional baggage what she says carries. She's probably not even aware of it. If she's inconsiderate, it's because she just didn't consider it.

So thank you for posting, because I'm going to get a lot out of reading the responses.   Often I feel like I lean towards settling for a partner who believes I am their soul mate...and then I realize that it's because I have more faith in myself to be loyal, loving, and compromising than my partners. Which isn't fair to them, and really speaks to a deeper insecurity in me regarding just being loved as is, for authentic me.  Just as equally, I fall on the other camp of accepting that I could pursue someone amazing, and then accept the fact that they made their choice to settle for me, and that is choice enough. But I would always be heaping pressure on myself to be a better partner, even if they were comfortable with their compromise. I might become a better person for it, or I might rot into a neurotic mess.   Which then starts the cycle all over again because looking at the first scenario, how could I be with someone who puts me on a pedestal? What if they're jumping through hoops and doing all sorts of mental exercises in some sort of tortuous attempt to win me over because they know in their heart that I have settled? How could I do that to them?  GAH! I'd rather settle for someone who settles for me, just to take off the pressure."

I have been saved from sadness so much by an ENFP, but every time that I have tried to meaningfully thank them, they make me feel so warm and fuzzy that my effort was worth far less then their response. I think I have an emotional debt to that person that can't be repaid, so I would feel better knowing that someone like them finds me perfect for them, instead of someone like them giving up the potential for perfect joy so I am happy.  I tend to value people by how close I can feel to them, and since I've lost myself, I would guarantee that an ENFP, who I feel understands me perfectly, finds a perfectly understanding person for their own life, rather than ever let them settle for me. If someone were to love me simply because I love them, finding someone they can truly love would be my highest priority. I would prefer to be alone and know that they are perfectly happy with someone else, than feel wonderful at the expense of an ENFP's possible future.   On the other hand, if an ENFP wanted me intimately in their life, I wouldn't hesitate to let them take me. I would rather have an ENFP's emotional need completely satisfied, then look for someone to satisfy my own, because I think being able to sacrifice happiness for an ENFP is a rare and special opportunity that might only happen once in my lifetime. I could feel absolutely miserable inside, but so long as they feel me and care about me, then I'll be everything I want to be: happy with life, exiting and energetic, and passionately loving."

ENFP,3aak3q,thenightwater,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, they know their stuff. And more important to me, it's a forum, you can discuss about it with them, they can discuss about it between them, they can ask you additional questions etc... and thus, it becomes more accurate. Articles, blogs, videos, researches and tests can be made by the more competent people in the world, it gives you just one point of view, one explanation, one possible type. When there is a discussion, there are several points of view, there are arguments, and you can see all of them. You can agree with some, disagree with some others, but the important thing is to  see the discussion, the process.    And for me, answering a questionnaire is more personnal and accurate than taking a test, because you can answer the questionnaire the way you want. Not only what you say is important, but how you say it, the words or the expressions you use, the feelings and emotions you're trying to express. When taking a test online, the entire second part is absent."
ENFP,3aak3q,NeoSapien65,3,Thu Jun 18 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they know their stuff, and sometimes they don't.

It's even worse when they act as tho they are an authority.  I haven't even browsed there in a number of years, tho. When I was really in to type back in 2011-12ish there was A LOT of misinformation and type bigotry flying around that place.  In general I've lost my faith in anyone who promises a ""quick solve"" of your personality type. I think the best possible way to help someone is to educate them on the 8 functions and how they differ, and allow them to determine which ones they prefer. I can talk to you for a week or a month and generally I will recognize a pattern that I think gives a pretty good indication of your functional preferences, or I can analyze a person's life (and especially their writings) and make a conjecture. I think even a personal questionnaire, if it's only 10-20 questions, is going to give too shallow a picture of a person's functional process, and also has the potential for being led astray (people think they're being honest, but really they're lying to themselves as well)."

To start off If you honestly want to argue your point not only are you going to need to be more specific as in what this ""socialism"" is, Don't just say ""socialism screwed me up."" Say ""this specific policy screwed me up."" Like a form of wealth distribution, or fees to pay for something, single payer healthcare, environmental regulations, or Government aid to the impoverished of your community.   And Second of all! Anecdotal evidence is terrible so even if you are more specific as to what ""socialism"" has done to your town it really wouldn't be a good argument because I could just as easily find or make up an anecdote to defend my point. What you want is statistics or maybe just an outline of how you expect specific policy to effect things, what is really nice is when you can find a better solution to the problem that has better evidence that it works."

I'll just leave this nugget:  Human beings are not naturally egalitarian. It is human nature to provide for self and family first.  We aren't like other mammals. We're creative, we're intuitive, we're innovative. In order to maintain these traits in society, we need incentive. Why? Because being innovative is great by itself, but if it doesn't provide for self and family, then why try and be innovative?  When other people see there's a reward in being innovative, it drives them to pursue innovation. We don't stop at just food or shelter because we've moved beyond that. We can now safely crave, and get, superficial things.  No, capitalism isn't perfect, and it carries frivolity, but it's brought us to where we are now. Most of the great inventions of the last 150 years were engineered with the knowledge there was a reward at the end of the tunnel.  Socialism in theory is nice, but human beings naturally learn to, and do, exploit the system."

But I wouldn't have expected any of us to fall so closely in line with a particular party's views. Much as Sanders might be on the far side of the spectrum, I'd say his views are a lot more in line with the Democratic Party's desired agenda than even, say, Hillary Clinton. Maybe because we tend to track toward idealism? I don't know. All I can say is I try to form my own political opinions, and not let any given party dictate what I ought to believe.

Doesn't make the sickness move along any faster, it doesn't help me breathe better, it doesn't soothe a sore throat, it doesn't stop the shits, it doesn't reduce a fever. It just rehydrates me enough so that I can do my school work while being a sick, shitty mess.   It definitely doesn't replace a visit to the doctor.   P.S. It also tastes kinda bad. A cheaper, better tasting alternative is Gatorade, but it's not formulated as well to get the water in you. But before I discovered pedialyte I would just buy a bottle of powerade (it's even cheaper and has some B vitmins so why the hell not?) in every color and then pound that shit. I'd go to bed with a bottle on the night stand. Wake up? Drink more before going back to bed.

ENFP,3aarjy,synthequated,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"I wish I could but then it would be rescheduled for next year, and i'm pretty sure I wouldn't wanna go back just for an exam ):  It's gonna be during my year at art school, I don't wanna break all that fun to return to this place lmaooo  Do you have solutions to the temperature problem? Being too hot and being too cold at the same time is genuinely the worst syhhhgsgh"

ENFP,3a8agy,PuzzlePirate,5,Thu Jun 18 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"They're so cute!   I so totally miss my INTJ bestie from high school. So grounding. She kept me calm for years till we eventually went to different schools and then I never quite got anyone like that again (or that peace even). I've not really done best friends in over 10 years, let alone friends. As an ENFP, that is a rather sucky sitch to be in."
ENFP,3a8agy,piconet-2,2,Thu Jun 18 04:34:34 2015 UTC,It is an adorable channel

ENFP,3a85lj,Jcavezza,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:55:30 2015 UTC,It said i was an ENFP.  But my friend is has been studying it for 10 years and said there not always right.
ENFP,3a85lj,FlutterShy-,2,Thu Jun 18 00:17:50 2015 UTC,None of the tests are completely conclusive all of the time. Have you looked into function stacks at all?   The stack for an ENFP is Ne>Fi>Te>Si.
ENFP,3a85lj,FlutterShy-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:24:42 2015 UTC,Yes i have
ENFP,3a85lj,FlutterShy-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:34:33 2015 UTC,How did it turn out? I'm writing an in depth description of the stack of an ENFP in another comment.
ENFP,3a85lj,FlutterShy-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:37:22 2015 UTC,I understood it completely with the orders of functions and everything.
ENFP,3a85lj,FlutterShy-,2,Thu Jun 18 00:52:25 2015 UTC,That's not really what I'm asking. What were your results?
ENFP,3a85lj,FlutterShy-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:56:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly how you put it, Ne>Fi>Te>Si"
ENFP,3a85lj,Dejay79,2,Thu Jun 18 00:59:46 2015 UTC,Then I would probably type you as an ENFP. Which makes sense. Most sensing types who I know don't really care about their type enough to look into it.
ENFP,3a85lj,Dejay79,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"Here is a quiz for determining which of the functions you prefer to use.   Ne stands for ""Extroverted iNtuition"" and Ne users tend to be able to see the possibilities of a situation. Ne is all about pattern recognition and the ability of a person to make associations between ideas easily. This is the dominant function of an ENFP.  Fi stands for ""Introverted Feeling"" and Fi users are all about internal emotion. Fi deals with your personal likes and dislikes; your tastes and your values. Fi focuses on the ""self"" rather than on other people as seen with Fe users. Fi is the secondary function of an ENFP  Te is ""Extroverted Thinking"" and Te deals with order in the exterior world. This is the ENFPs tertiary function and may be somewhat underdeveloped. Te drives its users to seek organization in the world around them. Te also pertains to how likely someone is to assert themselves.   Si stands for ""Introverted Sensing"" and Si deals with past experiences and inner bodily awareness, or how it physically feels to be inside of your body. Si contrasts with Ne in that Ne deals with possibilities while Si deals with known realities. In a scientific experiment, Si can be thought of as constants while Ne can be thought of like variables. Si is the inferior function of an ENFP as is most likely to be underdeveloped."

ENFP,3a85lj,BasicBarbarian,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:55:12 2015 UTC,"The next step from here, for me, would be to read descriptions of ISFP, ESTJ, and INTP to see which type fits me the best. My function stack contains elements of an INTJ but my functions in order are Ni>Ti>Ne>Te>Si>Fe>Fi>Se and Ti>Ne>Si>Fe is the function stack for an INTP."
ENFP,3a85lj,Dejay79,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:12:37 2015 UTC,with Ne as your last function. I doubt you're an ENFP seeing as how our first function is Ne.
ENFP,3a85lj,petsounds94,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:35:06 2015 UTC,That's not the right link it looks like lol.
