LighthouseSherpas,3e5s2x,BackwardsOG,2,Wed Jul 22 04:19:09 2015 UTC,What do you think of FOP?
LighthouseSherpas,3e5s2x,iKevoXXX,3,Wed Jul 22 05:51:07 2015 UTC,"I don't want FOP God dammit! I'm a Dapper Dan man!  *sorry, I had to correct spelling on Dapper. Shit was driving me crazy"
LighthouseSherpas,3e5s2x,UntamedDeviance,2,Wed Jul 22 06:16:51 2015 UTC,LOL Yes!!
LighthouseSherpas,3e5s2x,iKevoXXX,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:40:18 2015 UTC,The important question.
LighthouseSherpas,3e5s2x,iKevoXXX,2,Wed Jul 22 07:38:14 2015 UTC,"One of the questions I get frequently asked is,  ""How do I get better at sniping??"" Some people are just natural snipers. It comes easier to them. I was fortunate to be one of those people, but I also practice with sniping A LOT! The only way to get better at sniping is to practice, practice, practice. Also practice with a sniper that doesn't have final round. It's basically like using training wheels. Shooting someone in the big toe with an Efrideets Spear and then feeling good about it isn't going to make you a better sniper. Find a sniper that feels comfortable to you and use the crap out of it. Destiny has a ton of sniper options you should find one you like. My personal favorite is Preydth's Revenge with an ambush scope. It shoots really fast and holds a good bit of ammo. I like that sniper because it doesn't have much aim assist and it feels like a halo 3 sniper to me. Find a sniper you like and start getting into sniper battles with it. Look for unique angles to shoot from and try to always have a better position on your opponent before you engage them. And the most important part is when you do get the headshot you have to whisper, ""Tango Down"". ;) Good luck and get to sniping! <3"

LighthouseSherpas,3e3tc5,love_pho,4,Tue Jul 21 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, his numbers are accurate.  And, can also confirm that his slower-paced, very deliberate strategy works even for us ""normal"" players.  Backwards and Kevin are very skilled, and I couldn't begin to pull off the same shots they do.  However, I have followed their strategy with my regular play groups, and we have gone from going 0-3 or 1-3 to going 4-3 or 5-3 (most often) or even 7-3 (once).    If you get the chance to play with them, definitely do it!"
LighthouseSherpas,3e3tc5,iKevoXXX,2,Tue Jul 21 20:48:47 2015 UTC,That's awesome!  Keep practicing and remember to have fun with it! One of the keys to our success is lots of silliness. Staying loose is important. If you watch our streams and one of us gets frustrated (which is mostly me) you will see the other player try to calm the frustrated player down. Have fun and thanks for the kind words!  <3
LighthouseSherpas,3e3tc5,ZGriswold,3,Tue Jul 21 22:47:48 2015 UTC,"thanks again for giving mostly solo players a chance at going to the lighthouse, I was wondering if the list from last week will be carried over to next?"
LighthouseSherpas,3e3tc5,iKevoXXX,3,Tue Jul 21 21:39:47 2015 UTC,We are looking forward to this weeks ToO and hope we get to play with you! Our main goal isn't to get you to lighthouse by us carrying you. It's so you can learn the strats and techniques that will help you get better at ToO for yourself and teamates! But we hope to get everyone we play with at least an Arch Summoner or 2 as well as teaching strats ;).  <3
LighthouseSherpas,3e3tc5,ZGriswold,3,Tue Jul 21 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"that's what I am looking for, I don't want a backpack, I want to learn."

LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,bkparham,8,Mon Jul 20 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"What we are running into currently is a lack of Sherpas. Our Sherpa to Sherpee ratio is probably around 1:45 if not more. Essentially, we have one Kobiashi who is trying to scarf as many hot dogs as possible in a small amount of time but there are way too many hot dogs that need eating.   Our Sherpas have adapted to doing raffles and games to make it fair. Not everyone is able to post on a ""First Come, First Serve"" basis. By allowing people to be picked at random, it creates a more even playing field.  However, there are many people in your situation. As a family man myself, I understand precious playing time. You only get X amount of hours a week to relax and enjoy playing a game and escaping from reality.   I would suggest going to each Sherpa and messaging them to see if you can schedule a time to play with them. Posting on here is also a great step as well! Everyone in this subreddit is nice and wants to help. I'll upvote you for exposure as well :-)  BTW - What is your gamertag and when are you available to play?"
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,mysaturn5,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the great explanation. Like I said, I have no problem with the subs current direction. It makes perfect sense with such a stacked ratio.  GT: x TheTwizzler x   I'm on most nights after the kids go to bed (9:00-12:00-ish). Same on weekends, however I have a little more flexibility there. But it's still mostly evenings/nights."

LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,robertmarfia,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on greater demand than supply. Not enough sherpas to begin with and we are all volunteers who have busy lives as well.  I used to do a list when I didn't have many viewers but I've slowly been getting more and more. I can't help everyone so I keep the list random. If I can't help everyone, then maybe they can learn how I play or strategies to implement, becoming the main goal of the stream."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,redka243,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"If I can't help everyone, then maybe they can learn how I play or strategies to implement, becoming the main goal of the stream.   Before I started working and playing, and eventually applying to be a sherpa this is a very valid point.  I learned to fine tune my game thru watching the streams, but I also do not have young ones at home to take care of and I have quite a bit of free time to play (my wife loves netflix).  But some simple tactics and alterations noticed from watching others play goes a long way."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,redka243,4,Mon Jul 20 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of sherpas stream on twitch. If someone is going to help you out, following them on twitch and joining the chat seems like a pretty small thing to me. Its also pretty fun because in many streams youll find other supportive people cheering you on and you can definately learn stuff by watching streams and chatting with others. That said there isnt really a rule afaik. Each sherpa decides how they want to pick people.   Finally, posting in others threads or going to streamers chats seems to be a better way to get help than making an individual post asking for help judging by the number of replies to different types of threads.  Hope you find someone to help you out. There are a lot of great people on this sub."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,Chrisg2003bt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"I understand and have no issues with LHS going in a stream-chosen direction. And it may seem like a small thing to you - and probably actually IS a small thing. But have you tried sharing one console with 3 kids? I may be able to actually watch a stream for 2 hours max on any given Saturday or Sunday. For me, it is definitely NOT a small a thing, but I see your point."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,ChazNassau,2,Mon Jul 20 15:19:38 2015 UTC,"Sharing a console with 3 kids? No definately not. Sounds difficult. Mine are too small to play (fortunately). Your best bet may be waiting for a weekend when youre alone at some time (if that ever happens).   I do sympathize though because i cant usually play with a mic for various reasons.  if you do get a weekend alone, try messaging some of the  slef declared sherpas on here and ask if you can set up a time. Even of you cant play a given week, go visit their chats and say hi. Twitch has a mobile app that i use regularly. Some of the smaller streamers have pretty fun communities in their chats.  if a streamer has seen you in chat before and even talked to you, they may be more open to setting something up in advance. This is all pretty hypothetical because i dont stream myself.  I never thought id watch someone else play for fun but in some cases ive surprised myself.  I will say that i dont love the raffle systems because its just so random but i understand them not wanting to chase people down. A combination of a preset list with raffle if someone isnt there exactly at the scheduled time (and even before) would be better imo but its also a pain for them to manage so i get why most dont do that."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,annuncirith,4,Mon Jul 20 15:29:58 2015 UTC,"Im guilty of exactly what you've said, for exactly the reasons which /u/mysaturn5 states. I do try and go through the posts on here when I can and try and pick up people with unique situations, destiny dads and such, with precious play time and organise something with them.   People who are regulars to my stream will know I owe people runs, or I pull 2 friends in off here who I said Id help out, or a destiny dad who can only do an hour on a Sunday etc.The rest of my time is spent picking up people out of the stream, and dome'ing people every which way I can in ToO. :)   I am in the UK, so appreciate time differences are awkward, but if there is a time you can do then please send me a message and Ill see what I can do to help out!  The best thing I can suggest is messaging Sherpas and explaining your situation, youll find everyone completely willing to do what they can to help. Which goes to everyone in similar or other unique situations!"
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,ChazNassau,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:06 2015 UTC,Will do. You guys are like 6 hours ahead if I'm not mistaken.
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,Lije93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"I want to be certain that I don't give the impression that streamers are in some way doing this wrong. I completely understand the reasoning behind the current state of LHS.  My dilemma is simply a matter of ""time"". I can't begrudge a sub for evolving in a way that makes the goal more attainable by improving efficiency, etc. I just need to figure out a way to somehow adapt to it."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,Ruley9,4,Mon Jul 20 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"To add to what everyone has said it has also become an efficiency issue. The first couple weeks I would post and ask for a list of those who needed a Sherpa and their schedules. I wasted more time trying to coordinate when people would be on and then actually showing up at that time than I actually did Sherpaing them. I would get in 3 runs a night because there would be a lot of searching. By using twitch it allows me to have all the people who are currently available at that very moment in my stream ready to go. That way immediately after my last run I can pick up the new person and start. This weekend I ran through 16 people in 2 days. And out of the 16 raffles id say 8 of them joined the stream within 20 minutes of that raffle because it was just the time they were available. The other half had been there for awhile. But I was able to to 16 runs in 2 days...wayyyyy more efficient. So head into the streams when you are free and participate in the chat and raffles when you can. We don't require you be there for hours on end before getting picked! But I do understand there are situations where it is easier to schedule it out so like everyone else said contact as many Sherpas as possible to set up a time. In any given weekend we can see up to hundreds of different people joining our stream/messaging us on reddit/or on console asking to be sherpad. That's why I personally have tried to move to a system that works as efficiently as possible. If we had more Sherpas, we could be a lot more personal!"
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,Lije93,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"We don't require you be there for hours on end before getting picked!   Except if you're asdf, in which case... lol"
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,GBR_COYG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:29 2015 UTC,Contacting the Sherpas seems to be the consensus. I will try to hit a stream or two when possible - though it will be tough to compete with the littles who also play Destiny :)
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,Lije93,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:24 2015 UTC,Do you have a smart phone? You can pull up the stream on your phone or computer as well instead of just using the Xbox app?!
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,Chrisg2003bt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"I watch most streams on the PC when I can. However, with the kids taking most of the daytime slots, that means I am out doing all the grown up stuff (you can only ignore it for so long) while they play. Even if I happen to be watching a stream and get the chance to join, that would likely require that I kick which ever kid is on at the time from his game. I'll try to get on a stream or two just to see how it might work. Maybe one of the kids is more altruistic than I realized and wouldn't mind giving up his time. But I know my kids, so..."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,Lije93,3,Mon Jul 20 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. With the mention of ""Choo Choo,"" I feel as though I should probably reply. I apologize if anything I state is a repeat of previous comments.  The purpose of this sub is, as you said, to help people. To help everyone who needs it, who wants it. And each person's situation for acquiring that is going to be very different. Some people have limited internet usage. Some people have limited time. Some people have limited skill. All of those things are fine, so long as the other side is also acknowledged.  As a Sherpa, I can tell you quite openly that I cannot help everyone. I don't really have limited time right now. My weekends are pretty open, which allows me to do things like stream for 18 hours straight. That means I have helped quite a few people reach The Lighthouse. Getting many people there means I get a lot of requests for more Lighthouse runs. I get these via Reddit, Twitch, XBL, and YouTube. Maybe even other places. Hell, I have friends that ask me weekly if I can run them that weekend. That happens via text, or Google Chat, or even Facebook.  This is where the other side comes in: I can't respond to all those angles. I just can't. I would spend more time replying to people than I would be able to actually play Destiny and help people get there/teach people how to get there themselves. I would also then spend even more time maintaining a list of people that need to be run in order that they requested, sorted by the time that they requested. That then turns into a ""well I'm going to ask for a run on THURSDAY, so I can beat everyone else"" situation. Which escalates. (Believe me. It did, because that's how we did it the first week.)  I suppose to summarize, I use a random Twitch raffle system because I want to streamline my side while still giving everyone and equal chance to get in. If I didn't, I would go crazy. We already run potentially the most people through per weekend of any Sherpa group that posts here, and we really really wish we could help more. We have to be able to manage our end as well. That's why we use Twitch. (Disclaimer: we're able to run so many people through because we have no lives. Do not aspire to be like us.)"

I'm not holding a grudge over the streaming trend - it makes sense.   I really just wondered if there were still non-streaming sherps offering help, or did the sub decide to go the sole route of streaming. Either way, it's perfectly acceptable."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,justcodeit,3,Tue Jul 21 14:54:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, I definitely want to to explain myself! The last thing that I want to do is have someone interpret what we're trying to do as...malicious? That's the wrong word, but I think you get the point.  There are definitely going to be non-streaming sherpas offering help. You have a pretty big range of people here in terms of popularity, skill, and most importantly, time. The best thing I can tell you to do is keep posting and asking. /u/chrisg2003bt said himself, he still skims the posts in here and hits people up that are looking for assistance.  I guess I should also say this: I'm really sorry to anyone that I can't help myself. I want to give people the best experience that I can, and I definitely think everyone in here agrees with me on that one. Luckily, you're in the right place for that. Every other Sherpa in here is of the utmost quality, at least from what I've seen. You can't go wrong in here."

LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,peglegphilly,3,Tue Jul 21 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"A wider discussion regarding the use of twitch on LHS is needed as its a fair point to say that twitch has become pretty damned prevalent over the past month (which we are not currently against).  The fact that has been repeated over and over in this thread is how the number of Sherpas is far fewer than those that need help. To counter this effect, we have welcomed Twitch as a home schooling system in terms of allowing people to ask questions and tune in to a Sherpa as they play an admitably long session with people who are already in their fireteam to Sherpa. This allows the Sherpa to pass on their knowledge to as many people as possible because the number of viewers will highly outweigh the number of people that Sherpa will be able to play with in ToO over the weekend.   Its not a perfect system and we anticipate the reliance on twitch to drop off as new 6v6 content is released with The Taken King. Trials of Osiris being capped at a 3v3 game mode has been the reason why many have turned to twitch in order to maximise their ability to help the community with their limited free time.  I'm always happy to talk about any concerns people have with twitch on LHS. Just drop me a message or reply here and i'll get back to you!"
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,JawnnyH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:23 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly not concerned about it. It seems a natural evolution to the current sherpa/sherpee crisis.   It just evolved very quickly - and I felt as though I missed something or would no longer be able to benefit from LHS if I didn't follow a stream all weekend. Obviously the need for Twitch has become clear, but there are a few who will scour the sub for stragglers occasionally so I feel better about it :)"
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,JawnnyH,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"Since there's a lack of sherpa's here and those that are here are usually big names and are full/swamped, I found it easy to go to twitch, look by games and go to Destiny. Then scroll down a lot until you see people running carries and passages through Trials who have like 15 or less (or make your limit lower if you want too) and just pop into a bunch and watch to see if there's a line, if there's a raffle, just talk and be cool and a lot of times people will pick you up and run you, no problem. Much easier than waiting hours and hours and being #40 on a list or hoping to win a raffle on one of the popular, many-viewered sherpas (who all rock btw)."
LighthouseSherpas,3dyarn,BackwardsOG,3,Mon Jul 20 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"I primarily work behind the scenes to be honest. A lot of the time, people will find my post on this sub (about me being a sherpa) and shoot me a message on Xbox Live. From there, I usually schedule a time to play with them.   I see no problems with having to get a ToO run through a twitch channel. Believe me, if my upload speed wasn't as bad as it is, I'd be streaming as well, but I can see the frustration that trying to get a run in the OP's process would be frustrating. You never really know when you're going to run, and setting aside a hour of time (while juggling 3 kids) is tough.   If you want to run, I am on Xbox One and would be happy to help you. Shoot me a message some time and we can set aside a time that works for us both. Cheers."

As far as I'm concerned, getting loot and lighthouse trips is secondary* to simply improving your game. Since I started running with /u/SkipBopBadoodle I've seen my k/d ratio improve dramatically and I'm a demon with a shotgun / Hawkmoon combination.  *except for my first Lighthouse trip, and letting my son wander through it. That was just the best."

When I started playing Trials I would go 0-3 or 1-3 all the time.  Then, I played with these guys and started to watch this stream, since then, I'm generally able to get to five or more wins just by picking up on general Trials gameplay and tactics."

LighthouseSherpas,3dx5yj,The_Real_InvI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:17:20 2015 UTC,"Hi there Invi, let me start by saying that i am not on Xbox1 so i cannot assist you in game.  Having a quick nosey at your stats though and i observe the following:   Your stats are very respectable, overall KD is good so you are right to call yourself decent.  The issue i have with your stats though is that the majority of your games are Control and then secondly, Clash followed by Iron Banner You only have 37 games of 3v3 mode, only 4 of them being Trials. Unless you are very much above average, you can't expect to go into a game mode you have little experience, and dominate. Your last ToO attempts were all on Pantheon. Don't be afraid to get stuck into some PuG groups and experience the map, even prior to finding a Sherpa. It can make a huge difference to the overall experience   I would say, focus on some more 3v3 modes where gun skill is a much bigger factor than 6v6. Run some Trials and don't be afraid to get a few losses, it happens even to the better players so don't panic.  Have fun with it!"
LighthouseSherpas,3dx5yj,Vibez87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:14:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips :) I really do appreciate. I understand what you mean about going into a new game mode but going from a decent - above average control player I figured I'd be able to at least do okay in ToO (hold my own, 1.0 kd maybe). But I didn't for some reason. I got absolutely turned inside out and upside down. I suppose that's why I'm looking for a sherpa."
LighthouseSherpas,3dx5yj,Vibez87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"I hope you manage to find a good sherpa. Might be best to check out some of the guys that stream and enter their raffle.   Control is a whole different beast though, i had a game with 37 kills and a 5+KD using Suros regime the other day, just to troll my clan mates. I wouldn't dare do that in ToO because i'd get destroyed.   Keep practicing and i am sure you will manage it :) good luck"

I will be around later but my time zone is a lot different to yours. If there are any queries, i am more than happy to answer"

LighthouseSherpas,3dwudt,GARBLED_COMM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:55:47 2015 UTC,"Hi Garbled - I've been helping people learn some things this weekend and getting a few people to the lighthouse. I posted something very similar on another post so hopefully people don't think this is my ""go to"" response lol.  Hopefully you take my criticism as constructive, here goes:   You mainly play 6v6 which is completely different to 3v3. It sounds obvious but people look at PVP as a whole and assume that just because they can shoot someone who is on a control point, it should be the same for Trials or Skirmish. It is not, 3v3 relies a lot more on gun skill First point leads me on nicely....Why are you using Auto Rifles? As much as i would love to say ""use what you are comfortable with"" Auto Rifles are pointless in most game modes but especially 3v3 where you rely on out gunning your opponent. They have the slowest time to kill which means that in a fair fight, assuming equal skill / luck, a Hand Cannon or Pulse Rifle will always win Grab some friends or even just some randoms and practice 3v3 modes. Focus on controlling the pace of the game to suit your style. Focus on communication, it is one of the most important parts of Trials. Watch other people. This isn't a shameless plug or anything but get on Twitch, come and view my channel or one of the other guys such as Tenebrae, Saaj etc.   Practice practice practice and ask the Sherpas here as many questions as you can. Don't give up on Trials just yet! There is a lot of fun to be had (rewards too!)"
LighthouseSherpas,3dwudt,Vibez87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:30:18 2015 UTC,"Gun skill is just not a thing that I have. I just have stupid fingers, and Robot Satan won't let me trade up for robot hands. I tend to move to the Monte Carlo when I'm having a shitty time because sometimes the High Caliber rounds knock Thorns off target long enough to get a kill. (Also he's my friend)  I have every exotic weapon, armor, all the not-so hidden gems from Dragons and Crucible drops, but it all turns to ash in my mouth in 3v3 gametypes, because I can't keep my reticule on people's heads."

This is the one stream I try to catch every week so that I can learn to play the maps!!  Definitely check these guys out."
LighthouseSherpas,3dv2il,mclougal,3,Sun Jul 19 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"I can't say enough about how good these guys are. You definitely learn the right strategy for the map that you are on, and the teamwork is awesome. I finished a run earlier with them, and got to the lighthouse for the first time ever. Do yourself a favor and check out either stream if you want to see how to really play Trials.  Thanks again guys, it was a blast and truly appreciated."
LighthouseSherpas,3dv2il,AdamClarkeX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:52:07 2015 UTC,Thank you! This means a lot and it was a wonderful experience playing with you. You're amazing!

I've had a blast so far and made what I hope will continue to be good pals in game. I can go shotties or snipes depending on team needs, though I will be honest and say I'm not a superstar, but I do decent enough. Good with revives and communication :)  i hope to hear from you, I don't care about the light house but about getting more experience and learning more cohesiveness, and having fun along the way.  Will also be on the stream"

LighthouseSherpas,3dv6do,LittleLightWriter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Hi, my team will take you through tonight. We have made it an informal tradition to take at least 3 new players per weekend to the Lighthouse for their first time. We're extremely patient when it comes to inexperienced players, but you might hear us clowning and making fun of each other. We are always laid back except in those rare but unavoidable instances where the game is 4-4, which I'd estimate happens once per three passage cards.  GT: HeroTheyNeed. Message me, I'll reply quick. We usually start around 7:00 p.m. Pacific."
