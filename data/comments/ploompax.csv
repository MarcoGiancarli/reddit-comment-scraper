While Massdrop customer service has guaranteed that they will honor the PAX Labs warranty, I don't know if I've heard of anyone needing to take advantage of that, nor what Massdrop's customer service is like.  Personally I would not take the risk."
ploompax,3e2nlr,firentxxx,6,Tue Jul 21 18:23:36 2015 UTC,I would just go through Ploom directly for the few extra dollars to make sure my 10 year warranty was legit.
ploompax,3e2nlr,SuperLentendo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"I would too, if I could :(  In any case, I have read as comment that said   MD has stated if Ploom does not honor the warranty. They will and for the 10 years as well.   Not sure how much I can trust that, but it's something.    EDIT: Found the comment(s)   Does this come with the official pax warranty?      This is standard for all products purchased on Massdrop. All warranties, product defects, or malfunctions should be handled directly with the manufacturer. If they are unwilling to honor their product warranty, contact us within the manufacturer's warranty period and we will coordinate the product exchange or repair on your behalf."

Also, it's very atypical that someone would be trying to 'liquidate' real Pax2's already. On top of all of that, you don't get the glorious lifetime warranty, which I did have to cash in on once with my original Pax, so there's that. My vote is to 100% steer clear of that and buy from an authorized vendor. If you really need to save the money and need it asap, hit up the massdrop going on right now. They're at least an established website who say that they'll honor plooms warranty, but whether that holds any weight or not, we'll just have to wait and see."

ploompax,3dyp2d,ItOughtaBeLegal,0,Mon Jul 20 22:42:42 2015 UTC,So i just found out that there are different types of Pax 2 units. Some of them (like mine) have the simon says game when you spin it 15 times. I'm not too sure what the other features before it are. Other Pax 2 units play funky town when you spin it a certain number of times and shake it.                 Did Ploom just make a bad batch or something? I feel a little cheated honestly. Can anyone go into further detail with this? Thanks

ploompax,3dvv0e,_LordHelix_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:55 2015 UTC,General consensus seems to be that everyone burns their lips on the raised piece. The metal ball in it seems to retain a large amount of heat which builds up and burns. I like the look of the flat piece a lot so it's not a huge issue but it would be nice to see Ploom fix that.
ploompax,3dvv0e,TheTempleOwl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for that. Not really happy that others are having the problem too but you get what I'm saying. I do wish that they would address the issue.

ploompax,3dvn69,good-afternoon,2,Mon Jul 20 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"No, edges should not get ""burnt"". True the outside of any load in a conduction vaporizer may get vaped before the inside of the load, but that's why you tightly pack the load - to ensure heat transfer throughout the load.  I have noticed that conduction vaporizers do tend to provide a more ""roasted"" flavor to the herb than my convection vaporizers - but it's not a negative taste... simply different"

It's worth it if you ever plan to ship or travel with stuff that may smell like marijuana to buy a cheap vacuum sealer at Target or some place, for about $20. (This is what I do of course). Just make sure to put it in the checked luggage and enjoy the flight. TSA/TSA dogs are looking for bombs, NOT weed."
ploompax,3duuqa,bicycle,0,Sun Jul 19 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"When I last flew a few weeks ago they made a big deal about how spare Li-Ion batteries may not be checked. Since the pax has a rechargable battery I was worried they might chuck it if they found it in my checked bag, so I just packed it in a pouch with all my other batteries, wires, chargers, etc., and took it in my carry on. Zero problems.  That said, I was traveling to/from places where possession is decriminalized, and would probably not take the chance if I were traveling overseas where you also have to worry about customs inspections and not just a security check."

It's not terribly difficult to get a company to warranty their product, at least it hasn't been for me in the past regardless of where I purchased something. How could Ploom possibly know where I bought it? I'm sure it's not physically marked in some special way and I doubt auth. sellers slip some special paper that Ploom would want for a warranty. So how the hell would they know? If they ask, you got it as a gift. What retort could they possibly give that could stop a warranty claim at that point? This whole thing has to be easier than it seems."

ploompax,3dt3f6,jackiezeller,0,Sun Jul 19 04:48:19 2015 UTC,This question is probably better asked on /r/vaporents. But this might be helpful. (from their faq)
ploompax,3dt3f6,Priapraxis,0,Sun Jul 19 13:19:57 2015 UTC,"The Pax1 is a maintenance hog - it requires extensive cleaning every 10 sessions otherwise it can stop working (that's why the pax2 doesn't use the same retractable mouthpiece design - too many issues).   Never heard of the Utilian650 lol, and I've been making accessories for the top vaporizers for the past year.  Honestly, I suggest you look at the Indica Noir. I have several and they are far superior to the Pax1: Almost as stealthy (more in my opinion), less smelly when off (flip cap covers the smelly mouthpiece), requires less maintenance (75 sessions so far on my new Indica Noir and ZERO cleaning done - literally zero).  Moreover, the Noir outperforms my Pax in terms of extraction/cloud density.   The Pax1 was a good vaporizer, but portable vapes have come a long way in the past two years"
ploompax,3dt3f6,evilbadgrades,2,Sun Jul 19 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"I don't get the maintenance complaints by so many on this sub--literally takes me 10 minutes to clean and I do it once a week (kind of relaxing, if I'm honest).  I do mostly use it on Low and Medium, which seems to be a factor.  Using it on high seems to gunk it up faster.  I also charge it upright, which helps.  Never heard of the other vape you mentioned, but after 1 year with the Pax 1, I'm still a satisfied customer and really see no need to upgrade.  If I get a new vape at all, it would be a desktop (e-nano or Underdog) and the Pax would remain as my travel option."
ploompax,3dt3f6,slukas1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"Not running on red is the reason - running on red produces much more honey (vapor condensation). This will gunk up the mouthpiece without cleaning - making the mouthpiece hard to remove, and can risk gunking up the sensor (which prevents the vape from working).  The pax1 is literally the only vaporizer I own which can completely stop working if not cleaned regularly.   I have run my Nano multiple times per day at high temperature (red on the P1), and aside from replacing the screen from time to time, I don't need to do a dang thing to keep the vape running for years to come."

I've seen many shipments get from us in Northern California over to New York/Florida/over yonder in as little as two days. Then again, I've also seen it take 3-4 days to get to So. Cal, so YMMV. I'd expect 2-5 days and would be very comfortable telling my buddy to pick the free method if they're in a hurry!"

Welcome to the PAX fam :) Just an FYI, our warehouse won't be shipping any orders out until Monday morning since the same-day shipping cut-off has passed and they're closed on weekends. It'll go out before 1pm PT but you won't get a tracking email until 5-6pm PT."
ploompax,3dl0n8,Charmadillo,3,Fri Jul 17 03:11:17 2015 UTC,"I totally feel ya on wanting to personalize your PAX! You're getting some cool suggestions so far, and I wanted to share a fun fact about our shell. I hope it helps you decide on which route you want to take.  We don't actually paint our shells. What you're seeing is a result of adding colorant to our anodization process! We dip the aluminum PAX shell in a bath, add a pinch of science, and out comes a shell that has this colorant adhered to the aluminum on a molecular level. Kind of like how a penny turns green when it oxidizes.   This anodization process serves a lot of great purposes, but mainly it helps disperse heat really well. As your PAX warms up, that heat is going to increase the shell's temperature. If you wrap your hand around the shell you'll notice that the heat is gently dispelled into your hand and, the next time you grab your PAX, it will be cooler :)  If someone were to sand the ""paint"" off of their shell, then they would take this anodization layer off with it. It isn't something I'd recommend doing, since this treatment also increases its resistance to corrosion.   Yay, science!"
ploompax,3dl0n8,Ojan_at_PAX,2,Fri Jul 17 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"Hi Ojan! Thank you so much for explaining that. That's a really interesting way to color them. I will certainly keep this in mind when trying to decorate.   Since you're here, are there any plans on the official end to release custom skins? I know you guys stock a variety of solid colors already, but some other patterns could be nice."
ploompax,3dl0n8,Ojan_at_PAX,3,Fri Jul 17 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"No official plans so far, but that'd be super cool. I'd personally love to see limited runs of custom patterns from local artists or something like that."

ploompax,3dl0n8,TheUltimateHigh,2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:16 2015 UTC,Acrylic paints should adhere to the PAX surface.
ploompax,3dl0n8,TheUltimateHigh,2,Fri Jul 17 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure about the surface. It's a bit shiny, and I don't know if sanding it a bit would work."
ploompax,3dl0n8,Ojan_at_PAX,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"If it's the metallic case of the pax1 (with the matte surface,) I would avoid sanding it, unless you are using VERY fine sandpaper.  If you are doubt, just paint a small dot of acrylic somewhere on the case, let it dry, and see if it falls or peels off easily.  My one concern about painting, however, is that the base of my pax1 gets rather warm during heat-up, and the paint might not react well to that."
ploompax,3dl0n8,Radical_one,2,Fri Jul 17 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"That was my original concern too, in the text. I'm looking for a paint that won't flake when heated."
ploompax,3dl0n8,Ojan_at_PAX,2,Fri Jul 17 14:51:53 2015 UTC,Maybe mask the top and bottom and spray it with Plastidip. You can always peel it off if you change you mind or it wears out. I bet the led light would flow through it as well.   http://www.plastidip.com/home_solutions.php/Plasti_Dip?PATH_INFO=Plasti_Dip  It's available online and at many hardware stores.

Maximum that would happen if it were randomly searched and found would be the loss of the pax, which you could probably get back.

Then I use the dry side of the Q-Tip to wipe off any excess oil that didn't dry up quickly. This is 100% safe to do and it is beneficial to your health to inhale these oils. It also enhances your session because of the aromatherapy benefits it gives you. Benefits of Peppermint essential oil gives a cooling sensation and has a calming effect on the body.

ploompax,3dhx7p,evilbadgrades,2,Thu Jul 16 22:47:16 2015 UTC,I'd be careful what essential oils you use. While they do sell aromatherapy essential oils - these are NOT safe for directly vaporizing and can cause damage to your lungs.   My advice to anyone is to look into the safety of the specific brand of essential oils you purchase and verify they are safe to vaporize!  I personally rather vaporize dried ground up lemongrass and peppermint over the oils
ploompax,3dhx7p,djcodeblue,2,Thu Jul 16 23:22:11 2015 UTC,"Shame on me forgetting to mention to check for safety since oils do vary, especially when both of my aunts are doctors and I ask them questions everyday :P Thank you!

The other ones (such as vanilla) I'm not sure of until I read their descriptions from the manufacture."

If you want a 'pure' flavor from your herbs, you're going to need to expand your horizons beyond the Pax into less stealthy vapes.

ploompax,3debyd,Anaphase,6,Wed Jul 15 19:03:57 2015 UTC,They just grind it a lot more fine. I really love my MFLB grinder and it's always on MassDrop for a decent price

ploompax,3debyd,MechaZain,3,Wed Jul 15 19:11:26 2015 UTC,some conduction vaporizers benefit from a very fine grind - this ensures proper heat transfer throughout the load. The MFLB is one of the best examples for this. Other conduction vaporizers work just fine with any standard grinder

ploompax,3debyd,Fresh_Weed_Executive,0,Thu Jul 16 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"Who needs a frozen nickel for a Santa Cruz Shredder? The only reason I suggest a re-grind is because you can pack a tiny bit more in if you do, otherwise the job it does on the first grind does the trick because of their unique teeth design. Not to mention you don't have to worry about cheap polished aluminum or straight up plastic flaking off into your herb because they use medical grade anodized and sterilized aluminum.  Personally, I don't like taking the chance of having PVC with my THC.  and I never once said this pill crusher doesn't have great value, despite the reviews stating it doesn't even crush pills properly, I just wouldn't suggest that Aedalas go buy a cheap plastic pill grinder when he has a perfectly fine top of the line grinder already that's known to easily get the job done. So I'm not really sure what you're cracking up about here...  Anyway, check out the Santa Cruz Shredder website if you're curious as to what all the hype is about! I've had mine for over a year and I'll never go back to the cheap china made or plastic grinders. Its really something else."
ploompax,3debyd,sicknarnar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:03:10 2015 UTC,This cost <$10.  It grinds it fine enough I have to decide when to stop because it keeps making vapor. Ive never used the shredder but i read a lot about it.  I got this to hold me over after i bought the pax untill i was ok with dropping  30 on a grinder but i never needed to.

It was smellproof at first, but eventually I felt the entire case just absorbed the smell of what's inside, and even when closed I could notice the smell.  Just received #2 about 2 weeks ago. Plastic, won't absorb smell. Fits great. Latch is convenient, but not exactly what I was expecting. I'm not saying it's bad or that it doesn't do the job, just that I wish there was a way to physically see and compare both the latch and the screwtop before making a decision."

ploompax,3cwnj3,Dspamoni10,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:42:16 2015 UTC,"I contacted them with concerns about my device being a fake. They asked if the contacts were gold or silver. Mine were silver but every picture I could find online showed gold contacts. That's anecdotal and not definitive, but it was enough to get me a refund from the eBay seller and might be one way of spotting a fake."

ploompax,3ctl00,Martin6040,-8,Fri Jul 10 22:26:00 2015 UTC,My guess would be that the pax is actually made for tobacco and they sell their own ready to go tobacco.

PAX staff probably uses it for pot too, ever seen there staff picture, just a guess but lot's of them look high. It's just safer saying it's for tobacco."
ploompax,3ct0ha,busst,3,Fri Jul 10 15:12:21 2015 UTC,I bought both and find it to be a drastic improvement. More evenly cooked and I have to clean it less. Also with the new screen the draw is less milkshake and more airy. I do notice I spend less time with the oven on too as I can more easily tell when it's done. 2 thumbs up if it didn't cost so much

Just take the original screen and slightly bend the edges like a skateboard. I get HUGE clouds of smoke. Also, how does one get a sticky mouthpiece? Never had this problem."

One red flag is that you mentioned it was ""sealed in the original plastic wrap."" We don't actually shrink wrap any of our boxes. Because of that, and the fact that there won't be a warranty ascribed to any purchase from a third-party reseller, I'd avoid that purchase and look for an authorized seller near you instead."

As /u/sgtsuicide mentioned, it's not advisable to soak the oven lid but it's not because it'll dissolve. Our oven lids have insulation within, and are not air-tight, so soaking it in any liquid will result in that insulation getting wet. If that happens, you can just let your lid air dry for a day or two and then resume normal use. The screen and mouthpiece are totally fine to soak in rubbing alcohol, though! I'll PM you to get the ball rolling."

ploompax,3cl6fm,Magnum_Chorizo,3,Wed Jul 8 22:39:01 2015 UTC,"Great question! Check out our recommend steps on our site for PAX and PAX 2 (Chapter 7 on the video).  My personal cleaning steps for my PAX are:   Pop off the mouthpiece and soak it in a dish of iso. Dip a pipe cleaner in iso and thread it through the vapor path. Push out the screen and floss the pipe cleaner through the path until it's clean (hold it up to a light and look down the tube. It should be smooth like a rifle barrel). Put the screen in the dish of rubbing alcohol along with the mouthpiece Dip a pipe cleaner in rubbing alcohol and scrub the oven to remove any buildup.  Then do the same with the oven lid and a pipe cleaner. Remove the screen from the iso, run it under water for a sec, and scrub away any buildup. Dry the screen and then reinsert it. Remove the mouthpiece from the iso, run it under water, and then dry it. Grab some mouthpiece lubricant and put 1 drop on the sliding metal ring on the outside of the mouthpiece's stem. Put 1-2 drops on the inside of the mouthpiece's stem as well. Put the mouthpiece back on and rapidly click it up and down 10 times to distribute the lubricant around. Let it dry and enjoy an oven load!   If your PAX is a bit overdue for a cleaning it won't hurt to soak your mouthpiece for a bit longer. That lubricant prevents residue from sticking to it in the first place, so you don't have to soak it for long, but if it's been a while then leave it in the iso for an hour or so before taking it out and re-lubricating. Hope this helps!"

ploompax,3cias7,8668,2,Wed Jul 8 05:37:42 2015 UTC,"While vapor is not as harsh as smoke, it is still very hot. You're heating your bud to 400 degrees, so that vapor is gonna be very hot, filtering through water and ice makes the inhale a lot smoother.  No it's not a necessity, but if you have a bong, an adapter and hose can cost you $5."
ploompax,3cm3tl,no_fap_plz,6,Wed Jul 8 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"Every body is different, we cannot tell you how many hits or how much to consume. All I can say is vaporizing is a delayed reaction. It takes 10 minutes before you 'feel' it. For smokers, you are expecting that instant headrush - you won't get that because you aren't combusting (and creating a whole bunch of toxic chemicals including carbon monoxide).   Honestly, for a noob. I say do this: Give up smoking for 2 weeks. Use the Pax instead for that time (do not light a j, do not smoke at all, vape only!) - give your body time to adjust and learn what the difference is between cannabis, and combustion.   Moreover, pack the Pax1 full. Set it to medium temperature and let it heat up. Take a big puff. Wait 30 seconds, take another. Do as many as you think you need, or until the unit stops producing any vapor (this can take 10 minutes or longer with a fully packed oven).   Put the vape down and wait 20-30 minutes.   Again - DO NOT SMOKE - if after 30 minutes you're not feeling it, try bumping up the temperature to the max temp. Finish off the load - wait another 10 minutes.  Rinse, repeat if necessary in the beginning.   The pax1 is not the most powerful vape in the world, but it will medicate if you're patient and have the time to medicate! Every vape is different, and it's fun to switch them up from time to time. I have 5 different ones  - some portable, some plugins. All of them (including the Pax) can medicate me. It's all a question of how long it takes"

ploompax,3cejhh,agoops,3,Tue Jul 7 08:07:42 2015 UTC,"For the OG PAX, the oven is going to maintain a fixed temp the entire time it's on. This means that, should you wait 10 seconds between draws, moisture will continue to be extracted and you can let it build up for a bigger draw. If you take another draw right after, without giving it the same 10 second wait (or however long), you'll notice a change in vapor output.   For PAX 2, the lip sensor is going to manage the material temp by dynamically adjusting the oven temp. Once that ""X"" hits green then oven is going to begin to cool down, lowering your material temp and conserving it. Once the capacitive sensor detects your touch, the oven will rapidly heat up to make up for heat lost when drawing cool air through the vapor path. This is ideal because the flavor lasts longer and the vapor output is much more consistent from one draw to the next.  You'll probably notice denser vapor output if you try drawing for a few seconds instead of doing it in half-second bursts so the lip sensor can work its magic!"

ploompax,3cdw2c,ybt_sun,3,Tue Jul 7 03:45:06 2015 UTC,"If you are looking at the Ploom Pax website, then the pax 1 should be about $200 and the pax 2 at $280. I believe both are free shipping as well. The pax 2 is the better buy if you can afford the extra cost, not only does it have more small, interactive features but a couple of complaints about the pax 1 is that it had to be cleaned very frequently, it is a pain to clean, and I often burnt my lips on the mouth piece. The Pax 2 is considerably more easy to clean and you won't have to do it as often, plus the new silicon mouthpiece very rarely gets hot enough to even feel the heat. I would hands down recommend the pax 2"
ploompax,3cdw2c,TheDairyKing,3,Tue Jul 7 06:43:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of what you said, being a owner of both the pax 1 and 2. Although I will say that if you burn your lips, that isnt the Pax's fault, you are just puffing a tad too hard. It used to happen to me as well.   For OP, the main benefits I notcied is the look is much more sleek and modern, which for me who works in design I love (but its not a factor for everyone). I also use small bowls, I dont pack it full and the new oven design made it so that you can put a half bowl and pack it down and it vapes just fine. You also have a better battery and 4 temp settings which I love. As the guy above said as well, much less cleaning. Personally for the price difference, after having both, I would go for the 2."

The pax2 is the best discreet/high quality vape by many people's book. If that's what you're in the market for, just buy it.  (I'm a happy pax1 user who bought just before the 2 was announced/1 price dropped. Still happy)"
ploompax,3caxqy,epiphyte1001,12,Mon Jul 6 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, really sorry about the rocky start with your PAX! You mentioned getting in touch with us, so feel free to PM me your case number and I can get on top of it right away.  /u/sicknarnar gave some good advice, although it does not necessarily suggest that your PAX is counterfeit. The tip they had recommended is something I'll suggest on brand new PAX that have been sitting on the shelf for a bit too long. Charging without the mouthpiece can ""jump start"" your PAX and get things fully up and running, and can then be charged the traditional way (with the mouthpiece in) from then on."

ploompax,3caxqy,Ojan_at_PAX,3,Wed Jul 8 21:54:18 2015 UTC,"Since day 1 of my Pax ownership, I've had the same problem. I've always assumed that it was just poor design or, since it was a launch model, just the product of a good enough design. I purchased mine from Vape World, so I am confident it is not a fake.  I've always had to angrily adjust my Pax on the charger to get any signs of life from it. I keep the contacts clean, everything looks fine, not bent or anything, and it's a battle to get it to charge. Once the little light comes on, I have to delicately, and with wide eyes, back away from the device and hope not to knock it from it's perfect position. You're just going to have to wrestle with it and make it perfect if this is your problem.  I've managed to live with this, and I don't intend to bash the device, I love it. I don't use it as much as I'd like, and my Pax has a few other issues, but it is a great device.  I want to clarify that I have spoken to Pax support about this and I do not need any assistance via reddit."

I'm a strong beleiver in buying directly from the company itself since you'll never be worried about any problems. Spending an extra $50 to me is worth it for peace of mind and the 10 year guaranteed warranty.  If you're worried about price, simply go for the Pax 1 which is discounted already.

I found that the bud that vapes the best is cured not wet or really sticky. Also I was having this problem when I was just tearing up my shit. If you grind it very finely and then pack it, it seems to work wonders for the vape quality. Hope this helps man happy sessions"
ploompax,3c7tqt,recreationAtion,2,Mon Jul 6 02:47:08 2015 UTC,"When in doubt, grind fine and pack tight"
ploompax,3c7tqt,recreationAtion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"There could be some issues that are preventing you from achieving Pax 1 like quantity of vapor.   Firstly, a very tightly packed bowl is key as you've been doing. The second (and perhaps most important trick) is making sure your bud is a fine grind. Fine grind where some of your bud is almost powder/very ground. You can achieve this with any sharp grinder, and grinding for a while (lots and lots of turns)  Additionally, ensure that you're starting on the first petal and slowly moving up in temperature. If you're starting from the third or fourth temp setting, you will surely reduce your sesh time (fewer hit, with more potency).   It's nice to start at a low temp and move up because the taste changes and so do the effects! And also, if your bud is simply mid quality with not a striking amount of crystals, of course vapor production will be lower! (when comparing to a crystal covered top shelf)"

ploompax,3c6k01,sidney_cattier,5,Sun Jul 5 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"I was a heavy smoker before getting the pax 2. Maybe twenty joints a day, I rarely saw the point in having a cig when I could have a joint instead. I tried the mflb a while back to try and quit combustion bit it didn't work, it just sat in a drawer while I continued smoking away...  The pax changed everything. Ive had one joint since buying it, after a week of not smoking, and it was horrible. I honestly felt like I was being poisoned and was about to pass out. The pax just gives a clearer high... It's actually a high rather than getting stoned.  It's only now that's fully realise the difference between the two phrases...   I honestly didn't think that stopping smoking could be so easy and actually better. Not only am I fitter and healthier but my mind certainly feels clearer and I'm more productive.   I've also got a volcano vape for home use... That's when I want a proper session. I use that alongside my kanger subox ejuice vape to create huge clouds of vapor and pretend it's like the old days.

I was originally starting at a 1 and gradually increasing the temp. But I feel like with that approach you're always getting an ""incomplete"" high, especially if you don't finish the entire bowl in one session (I typically don't). With the fresh bowl at a low temp, you end up with a high that's mostly a ""clean head high"". Sometimes it's so clean it feels like you're not even high at all, which to me is frustrating. Say I take 5-6 hits and end the session. Later I pick it up again at a 3/4 temp, but now all that's left are those components that give more of the body high. So again I'm not getting the full head+body experience. With a fresh bowl at higher heat I feel like I get the best of both worlds, except of course it's less efficient."
ploompax,3c0p3z,DIYsurgery,3,Fri Jul 3 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"Hrm, after thinking about this, then looking up an article (granted there are likely others out there with conflicting data), and knowing that the PAX 2 vapes between 360°F and 420°F, some intersting things emurge. Following that article listed above as a guide, it means that the following should be true:   Low (one petal): 360°F - THC, CBD, Delta-8-THC Medium (two petal): 380°F - CBN Medium-High (three petal): 400°F - no new compounds High (four petal): 420°F - CBC, THCV   Granted, of course, these are just averages. Likely plant material is vaporizing along the entire spectrum, and it's also greatly effected by the speed of the draw (cooling the material) and a unit's specific behaviors / quarks.  However, looking at this information I'm still not able to understand how utilizing the device at different temperatures would cause vastly different experiences. Thoughts?"

The sandwich hits you better if you eat it all at once.  Yes the sum of the parts are there, slowly releasing with each new heat level, but its a big difference if it takes 20 min( or a different session) to switch from peanut butter to jelly jar in terms of a complete peanut butter and jelly experience [6]"
ploompax,3c0p3z,BigManRunning,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:05:44 2015 UTC,"Well let's say your chart info is accurate. If you vape a fresh bowl at level 1 you get those 3 compounds. If you vape a fresh bowl at level 4 you get 7 compounds (everything from level 1 & 2 and 4). That's bound to be a different experience. If you vape at level 2 with a fresh bowl, then put it away and later pick it up again at level 4, by that point you're only getting the level 4 compounds because all the rest are already used up.

Then 70% or 91% for the top and the tube and it was brand new clean. My buddy was shocked how clean it was. And I barely used 2 q-tips worth of acetone."

I had 8 people all separately busted in my dorms last year because they didn't think their vape smell would carry out there room or that fevreeze plus an open window made them safe and I learned this at home (luckly my grandmother is chill so I didn't get in to much trouble). I smoke daily and love to vape even at home or school but when it comes to your school you can't mess around, your education isn't worth getting high over."
ploompax,3bkjd2,Hester18,2,Tue Jun 30 03:13:12 2015 UTC,"Open your window and put your hand under your door, if you feel air hitting your hand then that air should always be coming in and push any smoke out your window. No towel necessary. If you really don't feel comfortable with that then go with the towel and put the fan in the window. Either should work fine."

ploompax,3bkjd2,conrad530,17,Tue Jun 30 04:58:30 2015 UTC,"Don't smoke in your dorm. I used a pax with every precaution imaginable. (Towel under door, ozium, blew out window, and used a sploof) and my neighboors smelled it. Thankfully they let me know before my RA smelled it. To be honest, I wasnt even comfortable grinding weed in my room. Weed smells a lot.  Bonus tip: If your dorm uses cards to get in your dorm room, then make sure you never leave any weed or alcohol out in the open. One night I was packing my pax on a Saturday night before going to a party with friends, and I left my weed, my pax, and a bottle of jack just sitting on my desk when I went to the bathroom. I then came back to my room..... and the fucking door was out of batteries. So I went to my RA, who then went to the head RA of the building. The head RA said there were no maintenance people on duty saturday night so he had to fucking have campus police come fix my door. As I waited by my door for the cop to come bye, I was drenched in sweat and was holding back my urge to puke because I knew I was fucked.   Luckily I had the coolest cop ever. He came in fixed my door and kept his back turned to what was in my room the whole time."
ploompax,3bkjd2,DeathByTeaCup,10,Tue Jun 30 02:37:35 2015 UTC,"Why don't you just go on a walk with it?  I'm not sure what your campus is like but with mine, this is the safest route and pretty easy."

ploompax,3bkjd2,_dabnation_,3,Tue Jun 30 20:15:28 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I was an RA in undergrad.  For all people considering getting a Pax/vape/whatever to smoke in the dorm...NO. DO NOT SMOKE IN YOUR DORM.  /u/DeathByTeaCup is correct. Get one and go on a walk with it. This is what I did. No one will bat an eye at you, especially with all the people vaping ecigs and whatnot. But if you smoke in the dorm, eventually, you WILL get caught. Your RA will be doing room checks, there will be a fire alarm, SOMETHING that you didn't plan for but is inevitable. It is not worth your future to not leave your room to smoke.  Additionally, I don't know about your university, but our rules were recently changed to having anything lit (candle, etc.) in your room be counted as arson. They could potentially find ways to charge you for arson with a Pax or similar devices.  In review:  DON'T SMOKE IN YOUR DORM ROOM. DON'T DO IT. DO NOT SMOKE IN YOUR ROOM."
ploompax,3bkjd2,Jiggahawaiianpunch,4,Tue Jun 30 13:43:04 2015 UTC,"Mmmm ok. Most useful tip = Wait until RAs quit doing rounds (the time they walk through the building). This should be around 1am. Nobody to smell that dank = nobody to call the police.   Also, learn the law. Most cases I saw of students getting in trouble were in the instances where they approved of a search on their rooms.   If you can brew coffee in your room, do it before your session. I'm talking a $9 drip-brew Mr. Coffee and cheap-ass coffee. This will help cover the smell.   One last thing. Use a smoke buddy or something similar and blow your vape into a garbage bag or out the window. Letting the dank smell wander through your room is bad.   Good luck, be safe, and most importantly... BE SMART"

ploompax,3bkjd2,cameronward,0,Tue Jun 30 19:47:21 2015 UTC,Blow the exhale into an empty garbage bag. Think about it like inflating a balloon. Then tie of the bag and let it sit overnight. In my experience the bag doesn't smell the next day and your room doesn't have exhaled vapor stankin up the place.
ploompax,3bkjd2,febrezemuch,2,Tue Jun 30 05:00:28 2015 UTC,i think investing in a smoke buddy would be a good idea regardless
ploompax,3bkjd2,GiggityWiggity,3,Tue Jun 30 19:46:59 2015 UTC,So this isn't really even a vape question honestly. The pax reeks fairly bad. You're just gonna need to do your research on covering weed smell in general.
ploompax,3bkjd2,Jer95,3,Tue Jun 30 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"Get a smoke buddy (it's a brand, look it up)  and spray some fabreeze before and after and you will be more than good"
ploompax,3bkjd2,neanderball,3,Tue Jun 30 02:56:08 2015 UTC,"my friend bought me the the pax last year because he new that my school didn't take well to smoking (probably because of the fact that i  was going to bible college). to be honest, the pax does smell pretty bad, both the vapor and the device itself. but i did get away with using it.   i put a rolled up towel under the door to seal any airflow.  i bought one of those timed (or motion sensor) air fresheners so that it would be going off every few minutes.  i used a toilet paper roll with 2 dryer sheets attached at BOTH ends. i usually don't find these too effective, but with vapor, it really does help.  i bought one of those rectangular fans with several spinning blades in a vertical column. thankfully, its height matched the height of the window. i would put the fan on something to get it as tall as the window. the fan fit almost perfectly into the half open window.   me and my buddies would sit right next to the fan and blow the vapor, through the sploof, right into the back of the fan so the vapor would go right out the window. i only vaped at night when most people were sleeping, and i also vaped in the dark with a small light next to the fan so i could actually see whether or not all of the vapor was escaping the room. also, whenever your holding the pax while it's on, hold it close to the fan as well.   doing all of this, i completed two years of school without anyone mentioning anything about it. good luck man"
ploompax,3bkjd2,Jiggahawaiianpunch,3,Tue Jun 30 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"I smoked the original pax in my dorm room all the time before I even realized that it smelled. (damn allergies made me not be able to smell the dankness) The first two temperature setting isn't too smelly but make sure to blow out of the window with every precaution possible such as towel under the door (CHECK THE DOOR FOR CRACKS! My door was old and misshapen so the towel did nothing for me but my floor and RA were chill and wouldn't report me. Got incredibly lucky.) and febreeze the fuck out of everything before, during, and after the session. Depending on your dorm policies, invest in a candle or incense sticks because that covers the smell very well. Actually fuck the policies and get a candle irregardless cause would you rather get in trouble for a candle or for the room smelling like weed? It's a no brainer. NEVER go up to the third setting cause that shit is smelly as fuck! Keep it at the first two settings and just go for a long session to get the most out of it. I'll sometimes hit it on the first two settings and leave a little bit left and mix some more in, then hit that bitch on red while walking to class or just anywhere outside, it's discreet that way. How does your roommate feel about weed and smoking? Mine was no buenos about it so I'd have to wait till he was in class to vape or better yet when he's gone for the weekend or night. Now I was lucky as fuck that my floor or roommate weren't snitches because this whole advice that I'm giving you? I learned that the hard way. I'd be chilling on my bed hitting the vape on all three settings and just blowing it out to the side and just febreezed the room. Needless to say, the whole room smelled like pot 24/7 and wouldn't go away and the worst part was that I didn't find out till near the end of the school year. My roommate actually started to avoid being in the room as much as possible cause everything was just soaked with the smell of weed, my ass would have been grass if I was caught. The only upside about the pax is that it's very unlikely to go out into the hallway but I febreezed the front of my door just to be safe. The one thing that actually helped get rid of the smell was a candle so seriously, get one. Use it during and after the vape session. Now most people are telling you to vape it outside and that's never a bad idea especially since the smell will go away with the wind but if people are near you or behind you, they'll smell it. If you go to a college someplace that snows and gets very cold outside like mine does and you don't wanna go out in the cold, it is possible to vape in your dorm room if you're smart about it. Ultimately it's up to you on whether you want to vape in your room or not cause it's YOUR ass that's on the line.  TL:DR Stay on the first two temp settings no matter what, blow that shit out of the window with every precautions you can think of including but not limited to towel under door, febreeze, and most importantly, a CANDLE! Make sure to do it only when you know your roommate won't be in the room during and after the sessions for awhile while you burn the candle to cover any smell you might have. Inspect the door for cracks or anything that'll negate the towel and if you find any, get a fan and use it to blow the smell out of the window and away from the door. If possible, have a good friend or a neighbor that you trust walk by your door after the first few sessions to see if there's any smell. If no smell the first few times, you're golden. And as always, be smart and safe. Happy paxing!"
ploompax,3bkjd2,Insanely_Pale,2,Tue Jun 30 06:27:23 2015 UTC,Make sploof or get some ozioum (idk the spelling haha) and put a towel under the door! It's what I did last year in the dorms and it didn't really smell at all. It helps if you have a bathroom or something inside your room to do it in. Also make some popcorn in a microwave if you can
ploompax,3bkjd2,the_dab_king,2,Tue Jun 30 03:24:39 2015 UTC,"Got it for this exact reason, got written up 3 times, it is NOT worth smoking in dorms and my school is pretty chill with it. I couldn't even pull the weed out of a bag in my room because the RAs had noses like fucking blood hounds apparently. The vapor isn't what smells the most too, it's the heated up oven."
ploompax,3bkjd2,the_dab_king,2,Tue Jun 30 03:55:44 2015 UTC,Most important thing is to be cool with your neighbors and RA (most RAs suck tho). Feel out your dorm before taking the risk and always use caution. Good luck!

ploompax,3bhgqk,djcodeblue,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"No, he means bend the screen at the bottom of the oven to hold the planet material up and away from the hole that the vapor goes through.  The picture you posted is for keeping pressure on the material when half-packing the oven."
ploompax,3bhgqk,damndaewoo,4,Tue Jun 30 01:33:16 2015 UTC,"How about some pics instead?  Bend one side of the screen (markings of the screen facing you), insert int he oven making sure the bent side is in the same side as the drag hole. Also make sure you tightly pack your product, use finger strength to do this. Fill, and pack, fill and pick, fill and pack until it's full and no more bud fits in, and put the lid on. The purpose is that's there is not gap/spaces between your ps led product and the metal part of the over lid.   http://imgur.com/SSaoUPL  http://imgur.com/Hb4VtY6  http://imgur.com/zK6ASFR  Don't worry about waste because bud will last a very long time because input loses its potency. Just store in a dry dark place to avoid mold. If you don't want to smoke the whole bowl because it's too much then simply don't; you can save the rest for later. If you still want to use smaller bowls them get the Pax Sandwich  http://www.newvape.com/9002-pax-bundel/  Taking drags: once at temperature wait 10 more seconds to allow the product temperature to even out, start inhaling directly into the lungs like you would with a hookah, SLOWLY and continuously for 10 seconds or until you're about too feel that you can't take it anymore, remove the Pax from mouth and inhale a tad bit of air, hold air for at least 5 seconds, release. The second hit I'll be more powerful so beware. Inducing cough while exhaling vapor will increase the immediate effect of the hit.    Follow my advice and you won't be dissatisfied. You'll find yourself more in love with your Pax.  More tips and trick and everything Pax below  https://www.reddit.com/r/ploompax/wiki/index  EDIT: make sure your flower is dry for better combustion, you can do this by leaving your ground herb exposed to open air for about 5 minutes. For better flavor use fresh botanical."

I love to vape half-loads (or sometimes even less) on low a few hours after I wake up if I can, when I'm feeling alert. not the most vapor and takes maybe 6min into a 12-15min session to feel effects but it REALLY amps up my focus and attention to detail. almost too much, the first time I got this vaped an entire oven at low and stayed up for around 38 hours. really didn't expect that coming from smoking more than twice that amount 2wks daily before I used it.  went through a period of using low exclusively and saving the leftovers for edibles. now I decided instead I like vaping a half-or less oven at low during the day, then later packing in a bit of fresh with the leftovers and vaping it all at red (410 f/210 c on pax 1, I think the last setting on 2 is higher a bit). it probably tastes awful if you're worried about that but imo not unpleasant, and also a decent night time sleepaid for me personally. vaping just fresh for me at the highest temp can really bring out body effects for me while still being kinda wired. plus it feels like a ""waste"" of the wired high I get at low.. if midsesh at low I somehow decide I don't wanna feel like that I can just ramp up the temp. but can't go from high to low again."

That way your weed is sitting in as little residual heat you're never going to use as possible while being stored, and not just cooking in there. It also helps to stir the oven just before the next session."

ploompax,3bcyu4,Dooiechase97,3,Sun Jun 28 01:53:09 2015 UTC,I have been playing with party mode a lot and I have found that if you turn it three times it will go into party mode and flash somewhat fast. If you turn it three more times the the colors will transition slower and more smoothly. If you shake it 3 more times will change colors rapidly only when it is moved; if it is held still it will stay the same color but right when you move it will rapidly change colors[6]

ploompax,3bbzmo,nobishek,2,Sat Jun 27 20:36:24 2015 UTC,Everyone's covered the actual useful aspects so try holding it sideward and turning it to get a bunch of cool light patterns. If you turn it until all the LEDs flash white you can play Simon Says and getting far enough in that will make the vape play a little tune when you turn it on.
ploompax,3bbzmo,the_Ex_Lurker,2,Sun Jun 28 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"I found the best way to use the Pax 2 is start out on temperature 3 after a nice tight pack, then once the smoke becomes pretty light, I turn her off, give it a good stir, then boot her back up on temperature 4 to finish the oven."
ploompax,3bbzmo,DolphinsPhan,2,Sun Jun 28 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"I don't have a finishing grinder or anything, but I try to get as fine of a grind as I can.  I usually start grinding with the grinder upside down, grind until I feel significantly less resistance, then tip it back over and grind the herb into the holes.  I don't pack the oven super super tight, but enough to fill up the oven all the way to the top, usually adding a little bit more at the top that will be squished down by the oven lid.  After that I personally use it 2 different ways.  If it's morning time I like to vape on 1 until there isn't any more visible vapor, then head out into the world.  Temp 1 gives me a headier high and just makes everything in the whole world delightful.  Then while I'm out I'll vape Temp 2, enjoy that for a while, then when I get back home vape Temp 3, stir, vape Temp 4.  By that point I'm usually pretty much a manatee.  Other days I might only get to the first two temp settings so I'll just hit Temp 3 and 4 the next morning and repack before I head out.  YEMV, but I recommend it nonetheless."

ploompax,3b7w91,nathanielwinter,3,Fri Jun 26 21:05:04 2015 UTC,"Well, first, I usually have my backpack with me. When they check your bag at the gates theyre mainly looking for bombs, beers, drinks,  basically any large, noticeable items so I put it in a side or small pocket. If I don't have my bag with me I usually put it in the bin with keys phone and wallet. Last thing you want to do is set off the metal detector and attract attention to yourself. The biggest give away could be the smell. Remember, with the increase in popularity of Ecigs and other vapes there are hundreds of other items out there that look way more suspicious than your Pax - which is one of the greatest perks of the product IMO."

There are literally hundreds of vapes on the market these days, just say it's a vape, cuz it is. Just don't have any weed in it! And to really be safe, just stuff some baccy into the stove so you can even demonstrate if you ever need to. But subterfuge will one day get you kicked out of wherever it is you're trying to be if they ever ask. Remember, you have to be lucky ALL the time when you do this, they just have to be lucky ONCE."

ploompax,3b4agy,Hi_Redditttt,3,Thu Jun 25 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"Use the screen trick.   I got shitty hits until I used the screen trick.   The 1/4 (lowest) temp setting is actually very very hot for vaporization imo, but doesn't really permeate the oven unless the material is packed in very tight for some reason (I honestly don't understand the thermodynamics of this device at all).  Putting a screen on there will blow you away."
ploompax,3b4agy,Fremen13,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:08:51 2015 UTC,It's easier for heat to travel through weed than air.
ploompax,3b4agy,_LordHelix_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:51:21 2015 UTC,That is amazing.   So the weed conducts heat more than the air does?   So does the heat generated travel through solid material before using the air as a medium?   I wonder how this effects the ideal technique compared to convection vapes.
ploompax,3b4agy,Fremen13,2,Mon Jul 6 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that was a guess. I know air is a poor conductor and guessed weed is better. As an engineering/phys major, I'm guessing that the heat travels through both the weed and the air, but through the weed at a faster rate."
ploompax,3b4agy,_LordHelix_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:43:42 2015 UTC,Yeah my guess is that it heats up the air a lot but there's nothing to really distribute the heat through and through which is why I didn't think conduction meant the heat traveled through the cannabis itself.  It also would explain why when I stopped halfway through only the outside was cooked and it was green in the middle.

ploompax,3b5d5b,thesmokedjoint,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"With what your talking about would likely be bad for the pax. The screen is designed to let vapor through without letting bud get past into the tube or mouth piece. If you replaced the screen, not only would you have to clean it every couple hits, but you'd also likely get a mouth full of vaped herb (not fun). In addition the herb would clog the inside and possible ruin it. As for the pax pusher, I find it great. I've used the screen trick, which works well. But the pusher is better."
