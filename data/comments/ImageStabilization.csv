ImageStabilization,3dy5s1,YJSubs,29,Mon Jul 20 14:23:41 2015 UTC,"An olympic gold medal was won in a similar fashion.  Ladies and gentlemen I present to you the incredible story of Steven Bradbury.   Bradbury is best known for his memorable and unlikely gold medal win in the men's short track 1000 metres event at the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympic Games, owing to three improbable events. Bradbury won his heat convincingly in the 1,000 m, posting a time of 1 m 30.956 s. However, it appeared that his run would end when the draw for the quarter-finals was made: Bradbury was allocated to the same race as Apolo Anton Ohno, the favourite from the host nation, and Marc Gagnon of Canada, the defending world champion. Only the top two finishers from each race would proceed to the semifinals. Bradbury finished third in his race and thought himself to be eliminated, but Gagnon was disqualified for obstructing another racer, allowing the Australian to advance to the semi-finals.  After consulting his national coach Ann Zhang, Bradbury's strategy from the semi-final onwards was to cruise behind his opponents and hope that they crashed, as he realised he was slower and could not match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a collision due to a racing incident, and if two skaters (or more) fell, the remaining three would all get medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his own chances of falling. Bradbury said that he was satisfied with his result, and felt that as the second-oldest competitor in the field, he was not able to match his opponents in four races on the same night.  In his semi-final race, Bradbury was in last place, well off the pace of the medal favourites. However, three of the other competitors in the semi-final—defending champion Kim Dong-sung of South Korea, multiple Olympic medallist Li Jiajun of China and Mathieu Turcotte of Canada—crashed, paving the way for the Australian to take second place and advancing him through to the final. In the final, Bradbury was again well off the pace when all four of his competitors (Ohno, Ahn Hyun-Soo, Li and Turcotte) crashed out at the final corner while jostling for the gold medal. This allowed the Australian, who was around 15 m behind with only 50 m to go, to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. Bradbury raised his arms aloft in complete disbelief and amazement at the unlikely circumstances of his victory. A shocked Bradbury became the first person from any southern hemisphere country to win a Winter Olympic event. After a period of delay, the judges upheld the result and did not order a re-race, confirming Bradbury's victory   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAADWfJO2qM  TLDR: With 3 races from the final Bradbury qualifies due to someone being disqualified. Proceeds from semi to final after skaters in front of him crash. Wins final from last position after everyone crashes.  Edit : added tldr"
ImageStabilization,3dy5s1,reubenbubu,12,Mon Jul 20 19:23:35 2015 UTC,"I was there at that final race, WAY up on the top row where unfortunately the seats in front of me were elevated enough that I couldn't see the final turn. On the final lap I remember Ohno and the other competitors disappearing behind the final bend, and when they came out -- they were all over the floor. Some dude in the back skated right past them and took the whole thing.  The crowd was PISSED. Granted, these are casual spectators in one of the cheapest events so its obvious that most probably did not follow the sport. But everyone sat there and booed for minutes and minutes. Didn't change a thing though, the guy got his gold medal.  I kinda felt bad for him though. Greatest achievement in your life and everyone in the stadium hates your guts."

The point of a race isn't solely to see who's faster - if it was, they'd run everyone separately and just record times.  The point of a race is to race - that means not only managing yourself, but managing how you perform in the context of your competitors.    This is no different than someone drifting in a road race, or someone holding back for a final kick, or whatever.  It's smart racing, and he won fair-and-square doing it."

ImageStabilization,3dvlel,catzhoek,2,Sun Jul 19 22:08:20 2015 UTC,I always wondered why people don't feather the opacity of the actual frame in the full composition so the sharp lines smudge and it does look even better. Any specific reason?
ImageStabilization,3dvlel,catzhoek,2,Mon Jul 20 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"Feathering will not necessarily make edge looks better, just become a moving box with gradient edge, the edge will still look obvious. It looks weird, the background object looks like morphing. Well, that's my personal taste.  So i keep it as it is. I love to see the way original footage is moving throughout the image. And actually i already applied feathering in this spitfire panorama.   However, my rule of thumbs is this, if someone asking me to add more feathering, as long as i still have the project file, i'd be happy to provide to anyone who request.      To completely hide the edge, we have to deal with the exposure difference on each frame, since the background is generated from that ""flaw"" footage.   In AE, there are color stabilizer, but it's not practical to use in panoramic image, since everything is moving. Almost impossible to apply that on every shot i submitted. Even at perfectly still stabilization (non panorama), the result is not that good, the edges is still an obvious one.      Recently i experimented how to deal with this, with partial success (mainly using exposure compensation on pano-tools). The major problem is, it took ridiculous amount of time for the tools to analyze the image. Even with only 170 frame with small resolution (1700x500 pixels), it took more than an hour just to process that. (my common post is around 400-500 frame btw) And during that processing time, my PC virtually unusable due high amount of RAM and Processor being used. Even then, the result is not very satisfactory (for a still panoramic image, yes, it serves the purpose very well). But for moving image, it's still a long way to go to satisfactory  result. Better than feathering though.   And that leaves me to the ultimate why i didn't do this on every submission. It's not worth the time for unpaid work :)"

They were just taken because they were pretty pictures.  As a result, they were taken at different zoom levels, and they were not all pointing exactly at the mountain so there are different levels of distortion to the mountain.  So I can't just lay one photo on top of the next one.  To get a frame to approximately match the previous frame, I'll have to rotate, scale, distort, and change the exposure and sometimes even color.  Is there some way in photoshop to tell it a bunch of points in one photo, and then tell it to distort the picture so those points match a bunch of specific points in another photo?"

If your camera includes the focal length in the metadata, it will even deal with the zoom for you. I did this once to stabalize pictures of people wearing the same glasses. Basically you click once on the left image and once on the right image, then go to a different pair of images. Once you've got the pictures lined up, use ffmpeg to compile them together into a video.

ImageStabilization,3d7zsg,sinsmi,67,Tue Jul 14 05:46:32 2015 UTC,"This one is easy, working on it. Edit : Done, http://www.gfycat.com/WillingAllGoitered      But a bit technical question (to everyone, not just OP). Why sometimes imgur give us gifv (gif) when right-click->save video as, instead of webm ? I prefer working in webm, much easier and faster to convert to workable format instead gif.   Note : This imgur link is giving me webm tough, i'm just asking a relevant question.      Update : OK, this is really weird. Now the link is somehow always prompt me to save as gifv instead. But i did download the webm using the same ""save video as"". How is this possible  ?    Proof : http://www.gfycat.com/ElatedUnpleasantDiplodocus    Update 2 : I report this bug to imgur support, turns out this is a Firefox bug. Quote from email :     Thanks for the info! I just spoke with a developer about this, and it's a bug with Firefox. The browser is attempting to download the entire webpage, rather than just the gif. Unfortunately there's nothing we can do about it; I'd suggest contacting Mozilla for more info: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/."
ImageStabilization,3d7zsg,YJSubs,5,Tue Jul 14 11:45:51 2015 UTC,"So imgur's .gifv pages are served up as Content-Type:text/html which means that it's actually a webpage with an HTML document with a .gifv extension.  This is actually pretty easy to verify: when you visit a .gifv URL you can see ""Imgur"" and ""Download"" at the bottom corners which isn't possible if it directly linked to a video.  From the .gifv page, it embeds the .webm, .mp4, or flash player for the video depending on your browser's capabilities.  The .gifv URLs are just a landing zone to make sure that regardless of your device, you can see the video correctly.  From a .gifv URL, you can change the extension to .webm, .mp4, or .gif to get those actual formats.    Example:    Page type URL    Landing zone https://i.imgur.com/HHdC4oB.gifv   webm format https://i.imgur.com/HHdC4oB.webm   mp4 format https://i.imgur.com/HHdC4oB.mp4   gif format https://i.imgur.com/HHdC4oB.gif      As to why it's inconsistent when you try to save the video... I'd blame how reddit/reddit enhancement suite embeds the pages."
ImageStabilization,3d7zsg,Browsing_From_Work,2,Fri Jul 17 15:58:48 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for explanation !
ImageStabilization,3d7zsg,YJSubs,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:59 2015 UTC,"I thought it was the exact same file just a different extention, are  there actually 2 formats?"
ImageStabilization,3d7zsg,N4N4KI,5,Tue Jul 14 14:19:38 2015 UTC,.gifv isn't a real format. You can rename it .html and it'll open as an HTML page with imgur's infinite-looping video player linking to the actual .webm file that imgur hosts..

Here's the example (taken from previous request): https://i.imgur.com/HHdC4oB.gifv If i right click and save video as, it will give me gifv instead. Sometimes clickling ""view video"" will give me the webm URL version. https://i.imgur.com/HHdC4oB.webm    But sometimes it stays as gifv.    TLDR : The URL redirector behavior was inconsistent, i confused what i did wrong."
ImageStabilization,3d7zsg,YJSubs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"and I'm saying if you download the '.gifv' file to your pc and rename it so the  extention is '.webm' and see if it'll load in whatever software you normally work with, because I'm 98% sure it's the same binary file just with a different file name."
ImageStabilization,3d7zsg,N4N4KI,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:37:20 2015 UTC,No it doesn't. The webm filesize is 5 MB.  And the gif filesize is 129 MB. The gifv only have filesize 8 kb. I doubt it has the same internal container or whatever it's called.

ImageStabilization,3cz7my,stevomuck,2,Sun Jul 12 23:19:48 2015 UTC,"Usually in case like this (horizon with no usable track point). It's leave it to automatic stabilizing tools, cross finger, and hope it will produce decent footage, then fine tune the result manually. Well, that's what i always thought/use. And boy i was wrong about that. I never thought to use this technique.  This is brilliant !   But it's not straightforward to apply in your footage. I think i have to do like 20+ multi-pass stabilization (PreComp) to stabilize your footage, because the horizon area in your footage is in very small area.  Also, the water droplet is often throwing away the tracker, so i need to close watch nearly at every frame.   Also, although you provide the video source, i can't stabilize using the full 1080p you provided. Sorry about that. As you may see even with the 360p resolution, it took nearly 1080p to include the whole frame. On 1080p, it took 6K+ resolution, and my PC can't handle it :( Even with low res, because the huge comp resolution, it took me 3+ hours to stabilize this. I use very old PC :("

I can see how I overcompensated for the difference in zoom at the loop point now using the row of white lights, the ring in the end frame was about 30% bigger than the start...lots of manual frame size changing and tweaking to try and gradually pan it back in.  /r/ImageStabilization ...aka the loop seam detector :P"
ImageStabilization,3cc7ar,YJSubs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, zoom is rather painful in panorama stabilization attempt. Usually i lock the object size if there are zoom, but this one have too many erratic movement to lock on, so i leave it as it is. Actually i can't improve this much further, a more experienced user can delivered a better result.    Btw, how did you make a perfect loop ? With AE ?

The finishing step was just trial and error moving things around by a few px and playing it through until the motion looked smooth enough. It's not often I even have .psd files, most loops and cinemagraphs are finished in a maximum of 2-3 hours, so I'm already making something else by that point, no need for saving :P"

ImageStabilization,3c6995,WholeWideWorld,54,Sun Jul 5 10:34:29 2015 UTC,It's difficult to stabilize automatically due to the smoke and the generally low contrast areas of the background means the auto-stabilize doesn't have anything to 'latch' on to.

ImageStabilization,3c24qo,brainburger,3,Sat Jul 4 14:17:19 2015 UTC,"These hangers have trenches and drains that take the foam away once its been held in place for the required time (usually 20 minutes).    For cleaning up the building its just a mop job.  Any smoke contamination from before the system operated is more of a pain to clean.  I saw a aircraft paint hanger, where the foam system incorrectly operated.  It took them 400 hours to clean the plane back to a point where it was ready to be sprayed again."

ImageStabilization,3bq0s4,Appable,5,Wed Jul 1 05:42:40 2015 UTC,"Hello!  This is footage of the recent SpaceX CRS-7 rocket failure. Starting about one minute, thirty seconds into the video, the camera stops switching and it continues using the same camera until the failure.  Could the period of time from one minute, thirty seconds into the video until the rocket failure be stabilized so that the rocket stays in the center of the frame at roughly the same size and angle? This could help in determining second stage venting and other anomalous behavior of the stage in the time before the failure.  Preferably, the final footage would show the rocket at the same angle for the entire flight, rather than tilting like in the final video. Additionally, the footage would show the rocket at the same size through the entire video. That can give the most accurate view of the rocket during its final seconds before the anomaly.  Thank you for the help!"
ImageStabilization,3bq0s4,YJSubs,13,Wed Jul 1 05:45:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to retain the size from the initial frame (when the rocket is still close to the ground), the final frame size would be ridiculously high (30K pixel); if you want to see the whole explosion. I actually have finished the stabilization, but it was impossible to render it out as you requested.    Rendering with reduced frame size and cropped frame didn't obscure the explosion, but the rocket were rather small. Here's the 15 sec sample before explosion. http://fat.gfycat.com/UnitedClutteredDunnart.webm Shall i proceed with this one ?"
ImageStabilization,3bq0s4,YJSubs,3,Wed Jul 1 09:07:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Reduced frame size is certainly expected for this, the video is not high-quality enough to avoid that. Not having the rocket bounce around as much can help a lot compared to the source video, even at a loss of quality."
ImageStabilization,3bq0s4,YJSubs,24,Wed Jul 1 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"Done : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-WS5wEW7t0    Feel free to share to /r/spacex Hope you guys like it. I will retain the project files for the next 3 days, so if there are request (bigger rocket size, disregarding the explosion coverage), i can do that."
ImageStabilization,3bq0s4,youtubefactsbot,3,Wed Jul 1 15:15:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! One final request: can the rocket be larger (maybe about 4 times the size to fill the frame)? The most interesting thing about the failure is the upper stage of the rocket (which already looks like it has more oxygen venting than usual), so having the rocket in a significantly larger size would be ideal (even at a loss of quality).  Before I even requested this I attempted some stabilization myself, and couldn't get any real progress, so your work is greatly appreciated. I do plan to share it with /r/spacex (crediting you of course, I did nothing). Thanks again!  EDIT: Don't know if you'll see this, but it would also be helpful if the rocket were angled entirely vertically or horizontally - I suppose horizontally would be best for the aspect ratio."

Can take some time depending how well you want it to turn out.  Another thing is the camera seems to zoom slightly at the end. Scaling it back slightly keeping the signs the same size keeps the whole image smoother looking.

I fail to understand where I should tell it to keep previous frames on screen. and HOW?   .  .  Detailed questions.. optional :D     load all the image stabilization result, but not as image sequence.   load where  what you mean by stabilization result?  images sequence like animated gif or a collection of images of each frame?   Fine tune the result in Photoshop   fine tune like remove the background or actually compose the frame images into photoshop and adjust each frame start and end time?   Or you can directly open in photoshop.   What can I open in photoshop? the exported movie? the exported pictures?"
ImageStabilization,3bcmpt,RestlessChaos,2,Mon Jun 29 04:01:33 2015 UTC,"No problem dude/dudette       what you mean by stabilization result?     You tracked the original footage, then you apply the transformation you get from tracker, right ? The original footage will moves across the comp viewers, this is the ""stabilization result""          images sequence like animated gif or a collection of images of each frame?      How to say this,..image sequence is image sequence. Do you never render as image sequence before ? Only render as video in AE ? You will get a bunch of files, like : filename_####.extension Comp_0001.png Comp_0002.png and so on...   If you load the first image files in AE, by default, AE try to load the consecutive files as image sequence, as if they were a video files. But for our purpose to make a background image, don't open them as image sequence, turn off the option in dialog box. Instead, select all of them then load ALL of them, load them in new comp. You will get this background image, although not pretty, export that background comp as single image, then fine tune the result in PS.          fine tune like remove the background or actually compose the frame images into photoshop and adjust each frame start and end time?      By fine tune i mean, you will have bunch of image on top of each other (but flatten). You have to remove/clean many element(border/object/etc)  from that rough background to make a clean background.          What can I open in photoshop? the exported movie? the exported pictures?     Both, the easiest way to produce background is load the movie into PS.  However, PS has max 500 frame limit when importing from video, keep this in mind. So you may have to skip some frame. Btw, PS can recognize alpha channel from video. So export accordingly with codec you prefer that support alpha channel, if you want to retain that sweet-sweet transparency.   If you don't want to skip frames; to overcome this 500 frame limit, is to load the image sequence with ""load files into stack"", accessible through scripts in File|Scripts. It's a slow process if you load 300+ image, go make yourself a cup of tea while waiting.         Edit : Thanks for the gold."

So, why would you edit out the crux of a comment I made, or indeed, ignore my other comments I made and cherry pick one that didn't have much about Ellen Pao in it? Is it because supporting Ellen Pao is hard? Or you just don't like me calling u/kn0thing a retard huh? That's how we solve things?

(Only heard of it, never actually tried the software, supposedly have function to auto loop, CMIIW)    OK, let me get this staright, basically you run the footage with step ? : 1. Blender ->Keying out the ""lake"" ? 2. Avisynth/Deshaker -> Stabilize 3. MS V Loop-> Auto freeze the lake by masking lake,hill etc area ? Also auto loop ?"
ImageStabilization,3adqhr,barracuda415,2,Sun Jun 21 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, that one. Cliplets is a similar project but with a different, more manual approach.  And the steps I did are as following:   VirtualDub + Deshaker for the rough stabilization (I normally use Blender for that, but tracked stabilization doesn't work well if the video is warped by a rolling shutter). Blender for precise tracked stabilization on the bottom part with the bike. Microsoft Video Loops for the seamless loop (works very well with moving grass and looks better than a simple cross-fade transition). AviSynth to freeze remaining moving patches in the background with a mask."

ImageStabilization,3adqhr,YJSubs,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:06:13 2015 UTC,"Well...Stabilizing is just one click button with After Effects using warp stabilizer (Mac/Win) on this case, since it was practically only a slight movement on the scene, no need for elaborate method.   I have no idea what freeware substitute for Mac, but on Win you can use VirtualDub with Deshaker plugin (piece of cake to use as well). On second thought, freeware on Mac will be Fusion (app from Blackmagic). They surely have similar function, but i never use Fusion.   However, achieving a perfect loop that Cinematograph require is a different beast. I think you can key-out the lake (multipass, obviously), to retain the grass element whilst removing the lake (the hill can be mask out manually). Easier said than done, i think this one will be painful to key out.   Software to use to key out: After effect, Fusion      After that, it's just a matter of putting still image (lake and hill), to replace the one you take out earlier."

Two hours until finished; i have very-low upload speed :( Will edit this post later to post the link.   Edit, done : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZErrdFkZxB0   Here's the accompanying article that i think cover most of the background story unlike other article : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/07/mckinney-police-pool-party_n_7530164.html   TLDR; It starts because racism from a /some parents when black teenager were told to get out of the pool. Leads to fights. Backup officer were called after one officer didn't managed to disperse the crowds.   Here's McKinney Police Department statement: https://www.facebook.com/mckinneypolice/posts/344693609073689 For those who didn't want to access facebook, here's the quote:          Pool Party Incident: On June 5, 2015 at approximately 7:15 p.m., officers from the McKinney Police Department responded to a disturbance at the Craig Ranch North Community Pool. The initial call came in as a disturbance involving multiple juveniles at the location, who do not live in the area or have permission to be there, refusing to leave. McKinney Police received several additional calls related to this incident advising that juveniles were now actively fighting.    First responding officers encountered a large crowd that refused to comply with police commands. Nine additional units responded to the scene. Officers were eventually able to gain control of the situation.  McKinney Police later learned of a video that was taken at the scene by an unknown party. This video has raised concerns that are being investigated by the McKinney Police Department. At this time, one of the responding officers has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of this investigation.     Here's another context, McKinney Pool Party Teen Interview   Also an article that covering how it all got started : http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/07/texas-pool-party_n_7530502.html?ir=Black+Voices&ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000047   There's video on that article, taken from the link from this tweet, that records how it all started (basically a physical fight between adult female and a young girl). But it turns landscape after the initial portrait recording, so i made a rough stabilized version in case someone want to watch conveniently. http://youtu.be/7Bjj2X29uu0"

What i did was to locking the variable zoom from the original footage, to fixed ""zoom""/frame size.   Here's the still image comparison from the first frame (left is the original, right is the stabilized version).   And here's the moving image/gif comparison As you can see, the ladder in the background on the original image is getting smaller overtime, whilst in the stabilized version, they have the same size because i lock the zoom."

ImageStabilization,364pxg,YJSubs,7,Sat May 16 09:17:27 2015 UTC,"Good question. ImageMagick often adds metadata transparently to files where it's supported so that chains of ImageMagick commands can process the files without losing track of certain information. There's the parameter ""-strip"", but that one is apparently designed for EXIF data and won't touch the IM metadata. Strangely, when I convert the GIF with ImageMagick with no options to another GIF file, the metadata is gone, regardless of the ""-strip"" parameter."

Or maybe both of them is H.264.      I also test a couple of files, i download and re-upload this file from tutorial to gyfycat. As expected, not a problem, gfycat is reconverting correctly   Then i compare to my current WIP file.  From the identify -verbose report, even the gamma value is the same like the tutorial files. No obvious difference aside from the transparent background (the tutorial files use solid matte). But i can't compare all the stats though.

I really have no idea how this can possibly affect the colors, but I suspect it's a bug on gfycat's side. Maybe I should submit a bug report.  Edit: it's actually the disposal method (restore to previous) that causes the problem. I guess gfycat uses a different GIF decoding method that assumes incorrect gamma values."

In all seriousness, with a frontend like PlayOnLinux it has become really easy to use wine. Also, I only recently re-installed Linux (about two months ago). Last time I used it was something like 2-3 years ago, and I truly am amazed how much they advanced since then. All the games I like run on steam natively or are really easy to install through steam on wine, and I didn't even have to install a single additional driver so far. Hell, even my printer and scanner run without any issues, and my Wi-Fi-card was immediately recognized. I wouldn't have dreamed of that working without hours of time invested back in the day.  I know the stereotype of being impractical still holds true for much of the community, but Linux actually has become a lot more user friendly on the Desktop.

I've stabilized thousands of clips in the past, but sometimes the shot is just so shaky that if you stop at various frames, they're blurry because the camera is shaky.

With the power of technology, we can break this down and see that the camera jerking is what makes that board seem to fall on him. Seriously what are the odds that such an event would happen in just such a way that our brains are fooled? Timing, camera angle, and chaos all needed to be there in just the right way. Crazy stuff."

ImageStabilization,34awkw,Spddracer,-18,Wed Apr 29 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of you bothering me with this.    Start by watching the ""incident"" frame by frame using the sticker on the left edge of the frame as the camera's reference to the scene.   Guy 1 is wearing his pants tucked into his wellies Pay very close attention to how he falls.  His body position (right side to ground, legs outstretched) Note his position in the frame (near exact middle)   Floor falls    Guy 2 emerges from the dust in the right third of the frame  Guy 2 gets up (from all ""fours"")  Guy 2 does not have pants tucked in, either pants leg   Between the body position's, and clothing alone, I find it hard to believe you cant see the first guy getting crushed.  Even if you disregard the clothing and posistion you can still see that the floor that fell encompasses more of the space that was available for that man in order to avoid it.    The beam that was the corner of the above floor literally landed right on top of Guy 1, and Guy 2 who was on the above floor as it fell, picked himself up off all fours and walked away.    We can agree to disagree.   Edit: Not to mention Guy 2 literally falls into the frame from above.  Watch the original video."
ImageStabilization,34awkw,gh5046,11,Wed Apr 29 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"Your examples don't even make sense.  When you fall down onto the ground, regardless of if you fall on the side or not, you usually get up on all fours. You don't just use one arm and one leg. Also, after having shit collapse around you and bouncing you around, your pants can very easily be untucked.  As /u/shea241 showed here, only one platform fell and slid under the guy."

I've paid them between $250-$500/hr. Two of those cases went to trial. And I ended up paying about $8,000 in both of those cases for someone to do what you just did and explain that process at trial.   Even if you don't do expert testimony, you can get paid the same hourly rate as a non-testifying consulting expert to analyze audio/video. You'd be amazed by how many civil cases feature audio/video, and in most cases the quality is terrible, so a technical expert is needed.  You'll need to build up your credentials, but your technical skills are already there, and that's the key. There are organizations - basically expert witness headhunting services - that could put you in touch with training classes and professional certifications in audio/video forensics.

After cuffing him, he immediately turns around, and trots back to pick up the Taser.     If he genuinely thought the suspect had taken his Taser... why would he run back to the point it was dropped?

Some people are somehow convinced that the events preceding the shooting might possibly justify it.  I vehemently oppose this kind of thinking. It doesn't matter if he attacked the cop. It doesn't matter if he took the cop's Tazer at one point.   At the time that the officer pulled the trigger, he was firing on an unarmed individual who was running away. Anyone who tries to make the case about anything else is only distracting from the real issue.   This especially counts for people who are trying to support the victim by insisting that there's no way he didn't fight the cop. Personally I wouldn't be at all surprised if there was a scuffle ongoing. Something brought the cameraman's attention and I bet a fight was it (not saying it happened, but it's probable in my mind). The point is it couldn't be more irrelevant when it comes to pulling that trigger. Assaulting an officer isn't a capital crime, they can only kill in self-defense (or to protect the public from an imminent danger if he is fleeing). Shooting him as he ran away was not self-defense nor was he an imminent danger to others."

With this case, there's video footage all over the news of this guy planting a weapon on the suspect, so there's really no controversy.  Whether it will lead to the ""all cops are bad"" conclusion that Reddit wants it to; the jury's still out.

That's pretty unfair. I never made accusations in my comment and never generalized among all LEOs, but stated reasonable conclusions/questions. I don't think it is an unfair perception that many LEOs appear to have an ""us vs them"" and ""code of silence"" attitude; that we LEOs and civilians cannot have an honest conversation about what effective policing should be like. Combine that with this attitude the outright denial of issues like race (see This American Life's recent two part episode on policing) even though a lot of strong demographic data and psych studies evidence how deeply race affects anyone's decision making process, particularly of people under duress. It's fine to take a hardline position, but the cost of that is that one quickly loses credibility in the face of evidence that supports otherwise.  Anyway, I have plenty of empathy for the tough job of LEOs--balancing protecting their own safety, with protecting the safety of others, with the safety of the offender/trying to enforce laws, all while people are screaming bloody murder. I would have a lot greater understanding for encounters gone wrong if there were some recognition among the thought-leaders on the LEO side that there are systemic problems with law enforcement policy and that they need the community's help and an honest dialog about how best to meet those challenges as a team, and not as combatants in a war."

Generate a lot of upvotes and pretty soon each person is competing to outdo the other where the hive consensus is concerned.  As someone who's older, I've learned that issues are more complex.  Reddit hates authority, but an even-handed documentary about Iran Air Flight 655 doesn't get upvotes, whereas a snarky one-liner about ""the government said they're sorry, wink wink,"" does."

Not every citizen can go buy a full auto weapon in america legally. In fact it super hard for the average american to get a full auto weapon because they are super expensive and the back ground checks are lengthy and they check everything about you. Converting a gun to full auto is a time consuming process as well. You need some parts that would be illegal to purchase such as an auto sear to make the gun work completely. While comparing countries who have completely different cultures is thrown around all the time in arguments for gun control they are like comparing apples to oranges in an apple control debate. Yes its semi worked here, but we are way different than Australians. Gun control is such a hard topic to talk about with out getting heated because you are really playing with peoples emotions. While I do agree that there need to be some control, I think making them completely illegal would cause an increase in violent crime committed with firearms. Take for example Texas and concealed carry. Before concealed carry was passed the people against it claimed that Texas would turn in to a bloodbath and that there would be a shootout on every corner. There has been no increase in random shootings. The article I linked to below is a great back up. Also there are a lot of defensive gun use, and those are hardly ever recorded so its hard to see correct data on it.   Source: http://www.texaschl.us/ccwinus-effectsoncrime"

It's literally the context of the comments I was replying to:   there's literally nothing in the video to suggest that the black cop knowingly helped the white cop commit a crime.   Yes there is. He was standing right there when the killer cop manufactured evidence. If he is a good cop it would be in his report.    Him simply being present when something happened does not prove he had knowledge of intent. The officer's statements, if contradictory to the video, would show that. But there's nothing in the video alone to prove it because the officer's personal statements aren't available to my knowledge.     Because he was totally there the whole time and saw the entire incident and somehow realized EXACTLY what the killer cop was trying to do without any words spoken?  Just because he was in the video later doesn't mean he knew what happened in the video prior; perspective and hindsight people, please.   From the other cop's perspective: Is it odd the killer cop is moving his taser? Perhaps, but you're not gonna realize why he's doing it without having witnessed the actual incident."
ImageStabilization,31xzv3,SneakytheThief,8,Thu Apr 9 04:16:57 2015 UTC,The moving of evidence should be in his report.   It should be up to detectives to ask the other cop why he moved the evidence.

And to which I was saying he would have had no idea that the killer cop was in the act of manufacturing evidence at the time, having just arrived on scene. Hopefully he noted it in his report.

The comment I was replying to was stating that the video alone was proof on its own simply because he was present.  With regard to the second officer, we need to see his specific statements to determine if he actually tried to help cover up the crime; the police report would be too general a summary.

Specifically, the contents of the video and the guilt of the second officer whos report I've not read anywhere I read elsewhere that later officers arrived on the scene and attempted cpr then (not the first two) so the police report isnt lying neccesarily unless it claims the first two officers were the ones who did it."

If they talked about doing it before that conspiracy and he can face the same murder charges.  Even if you didn't pull the trigger if you planned on killing someone and you were there, maybe just watching the door or otherwise not physically involved, you can still be charged with murder.  There's also felony murder, if they had intended to commit a different crime he can be charged with felony murder even if they never intended to kill him and he didn't actually participate in the killing.  And the most obvious is accessory after the fact, obstruction and possibly perjury if he was deposed.  If you help someone cover up a crime or even just lie and say you didn't see anything you can be charged with some pretty major felonies.  It doesn't matter that he's a police officer, he just saw another officer shoot someone in the back and plant evidence.  If he lies about it he's probably screwed.

Is it out of the question that a cop is so focused on attending to someone who just got shot eight times that he didn't notice the other cop drop a taser? or he did and just thought he dropped something. the black cop has no context (and if he did we can't tell from the video). trust me, when it comes to police issues I'm firmly firmly against corrupt cops and I think police abuse of force is an even bigger issue than people admit. the cop who shot the suspect deserves the absolute worst punishment we can apply (I personally think punishments for cops should be worse than the general population because cops have an expectation of behavior and a position of authority, but that's another story). all I'm saying is that the video doesn't clearly show the black officer committing any crimes. if he lied on the report or if he covered for the white cop or if he actually committed any crimes then he should absolutely be held accountable and we should throw the book at him for assisting this piece of shit white cop. but in the video I can't see anything that indicates the black cop committed a crime. I'll be very interested in this story as it develops because I am curious if the black cop did in fact commit a crime, I just can't tell at this point and the video doesn't clearly show any crimes beings committed by him."
ImageStabilization,31xzv3,SneakytheThief,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I'm definitely getting a bit tired waving this pitchfork around.  I'd just like to see a shift in policy where cops don't get a presumption of complete innocence when a shooting followed by suspicious cop activity happens.  Too many clearly documented cases of borderline cops standing around while the more evil ones commit murders. The only way to make it stop is to put some fear into the on-the-fence guys so they won't stand around and let it happen.  I'll grant that there are clearer cases than this one to make a stand on, but this is just another in a long line of corrupt examples.  If the situation were somehow reversed, and a dead cop is lying on the ground and perp #1 drops a weapon next to the body, then perp #2 shows up in same colors and stands around, they're both getting arrested whether a video shows #2 doing anything obvious or not."

ImageStabilization,31xzv3,scubascratch,0,Sat Apr 11 13:08:59 2015 UTC,"Don't bother, I've given up trying to explain it. Apparently pointing out that the video alone isn't enough evidence to prove guilt on the part of the second officer somehow makes you an apologist and somehow advocating for the side of the murderer. Somehow.  I know that doesn't make any sense, but that seems to be the case here."
ImageStabilization,31xzv3,SneakytheThief,-1,Thu Apr 9 13:55:10 2015 UTC,"yeah it's very strange. my hypothesis (that I've completely pulled out of my ass) is that people want this incident to be simple and straight forward. they want it to be abusive cops versus innocent civilian. that's easy to understand and discuss. they don't want it to be racial. that complicates things, and can possibly make white people (like myself) uncomfortable. if they can convince themselves that the black cop was also somehow in on it or guilty of something, then in their minds it makes the situation only a police vs people situation and eliminates the racial aspect. that's the only reason I can think of why people are trying to jump on the black officer when there isn't anything in the video that would justify that reaction. like, my god, a cop just fucking murdered someone and all you can talk about is if the other black guy committed a crime.... very strange."
ImageStabilization,31xzv3,scubascratch,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:22:06 2015 UTC,"I've said literally zero words about race anywhere, so you should stick your hypothesis back up your ass, instead of creating this fake race-card straw man to try and discredit the evidence that there's a murderer and a cop who let it slide in this video.  Cops who don't aggressively police their own force are just as culpable as murderer #1. Until they stop protecting their own first, there needs to be just as much aggressive prosecution of any of them involved. That's what prosecutors and grand juries and trials are for.  You're the apologist here who is apologizing for another bad cop who witnessed his buddy commit a probable felony (evidence tampering at least) and didn't do squat about it."

Hopefully the courts will do the right thing.  I want to see the law go further and weed out the ones who are idly letting it happen. If cop #2 is innocent, then a grand jury won't indict or trial jury won't convict him.  If cops are unafraid to let crimes be committed by their brethren in front of them without taking action, then justice is still not happening."
ImageStabilization,31xzv3,roque72,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"good points. I'll be very interested to see where this goes in terms of how the black cop handled things right after the actual incident. the video doesn't show much of anything but if new information comes out that shows the black cop was somehow complicit or in any way tried to cover for the white cop then they should both be charged to the fullest extent of the law. as you pointed out, cop culture may play a part in this situation (and many others) in terms of accountability and expectations of behavior and repercussions on the job."

Of course if he falsified information on the report he with be punished for that, but the bigger crime people are upset about is the murder and that's why it's the main part of the story.

ImageStabilization,31nmcq,QuickStopRandal,7,Tue Apr 7 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"A similar reason to why helicopter blades can sometimes show up on video spinning slowly or the 'opposite' direction. The pixels on the inside of the video are spinning 'slower' than the ones on the outside due to the distance from the center of spin combined with the rolling shutter of the camera. The frame rate of the video happens to capture the video in such a way that the spin appears to be going one way instead of another.  For example, let's say a slow spin of 1 degree per frame in the video would show the video going in the 'correct' direction, but if it was spinning at a fast rate of 359 degrees per frame it would still be rotating in the same direction, but it would actually look like -1 degrees per frame in the video, appearing to go in the opposite direction"

ImageStabilization,31n84z,OSPFv3,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:36:40 2015 UTC,If the camera shot a few thousand fps a second would it be an solid video?
ImageStabilization,31n84z,MystikIncarnate,3,Tue Apr 7 05:50:29 2015 UTC,"it's less FPS and more shutter speed.  Generally, with video the two are tied together.  There's a small inter-frame space (for lack of a better term) where no light is being recorded, but at 30FPS, for the .03 seconds that the frame represents, the camera is generally capturing all the light during that time, so if things visibly move during that .03 seconds (3 ms), then the image is blurry.  if the camera only took in .001 seconds of light to represent the duration of the frame, then the image would be less blurry.  Higher framerates would help, in that the camera would have less of an opportunity to take in light per frame, since each second only represents such a small fraction of time.  The obvious issue with this is: how do you store it?  There are bandwidth limitations, and ASIC's can only process SO MUCH data per second.  You'd almost need to drop a full server with it, just to do the processing and keep up with the bandwidth requirements to disk, otherwise the video would end up as a blurry mess just due to encoding to such a (relatively) low bandwidth.  Too many technical limitations.  Easiest way to get a less-blurry picture is to expose at 1/1000th or faster, per frame, and record the same number of frames per second (30-60).  Now the question becomes, do we capture the 1/1000th of a second frame at the beginning or at the end (or in the middle?) of the 3 ms we have to capture each frame?"

He was skiing and had some type of gopro mount on his helmet, he fell, hit his helmet and go pro on a rock, somehow it caused massive damage to his head and he was in a coma for about a year I think. Supposedly he's out of the coma but he's not been in public and he's probably permanently messed up sadly"

ImageStabilization,319pq9,uluman,3,Fri Apr 3 19:15:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! You are a generous human being.   I have no right to ask for anything more, but if you want any feedback on how to possibly make it slightly better, then I'd humbly suggest: Slow it down by making about half the current FPS. Also, it seems that a ""perfectly timed"" rotation may not be perfect after all. A very slightly delayed rotation might actually look better. I other words, the start and end of each rotation seems to sync with the position of his front paws. It might look cooler if it synced very close to, but not perfectly, with the position of his back paws. And finally, the background seems to be a maroon color. Perhaps black or transparent would look nicer.  But even just as it now, I really appreciate it."
ImageStabilization,319pq9,uluman,6,Sat Apr 4 00:36:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback!  imgur actually added the maroon background color to the gifv... it's transparent in the original gif.

ImageStabilization,31225p,tebla,17,Wed Apr 1 14:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I saw it that way too.   Usually when people do stabilisations like this, the whole stabilised video fits into the black area (i.e. none of the video disappears outside the frame). Because parts of this video move out of the frame, our eyes see it as movement?  I'm not sure, it's the only reason why I think we might be seeing it that way. Or that the ball is a bit fuzzy/blurry (making it look like motion blur)?"
ImageStabilization,31225p,SweetLordKrishna,5,Wed Apr 1 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"I had the same reaction, had to put my cursor over it to see if it was actually stabilized.  This is definitely really interesting that we're picking it up as movement."

ImageStabilization,31225p,N4N4KI,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"I think it may also be due to the ball moving into/out of the frame and thus changing size, that coupled with how the image is cropped really leads to a feeling of movement."

ImageStabilization,30ae89,deviantpdx,31,Thu Mar 26 18:09:50 2015 UTC,"Story time: In the late 90's, just before hardware accellerated 3D graphics was about to really take off, CD readers and burners were what the cool kids were using to establish dominance over their peers. CD readers started out reading at 150 kbit/s, but as hardware vendors got their gamefaces on, you'd see a steady escalation in read speeds, with drives often labelled 2x, 4x, 8x, and so on.  Well, we had just installed our brand-spanking new 40x slot-in drives, and popped in a burned copy of the game Sin we'd grabbed from our favorite 0-day FTP a few hours earlier. A half-dozen twentysomethings were excitedly hunched over the desk of the lucky bastard who got the first burned disc, and the drive was making its familiar spin-up sound as the intro movie was loading. A few seconds into the movie, we noticed the drive was being noisier than usual. A lot noisier. There was a warbling subharmonic roar, not unlike a revving sports car, that grew steadily in tone. Some of us stood back a few feet on sheer reflex...  ...Which was fortunate, because the next second, there was a crisp, explosive blast from the drive, and razor-sharp fragments of the shattered disc sprayed the area around the computer. We even found a shard lodged in the wall, half a foot from where one guy's head was. The computer case made it, but the CD drive was bulging to the point that it was difficult to dislodge it from the 5.25"" drive bay.  Lesson: Don't buy cheap discs, don't buy slot-in drives, and always wear protection."

ImageStabilization,30ae89,FreshFruitCup,3,Thu Mar 26 08:09:53 2015 UTC,"Electricity doesn't just take the path of least resistance--the most current flows through the path of least resistance, but some flows through higher resistance paths too.  Crack propagation is an established science. Wiki ""Fracture Mechanics."" Basically, the reason you see similar patterns is because all these mechanisms are reaching their highest entropy states, using up their potential energy--water flows downhill, lightning flows to low charge zones, a crack spreads through a medium. The potential energy inherent to the system is used up to increase entropy. For cracks, which are harder to intuit, basically there is an energy associated with the creation of new surfaces in a material (which crack propagation does). The crack propagates when the strain (elastic) energy in the CD would be reduced by more than the energy required to make the new surface.  If you're ever looking for a pattern among different fields that seem similar, it's almost always energy."

ImageStabilization,300clf,slingerg,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:25:07 2015 UTC,You linked it to 34 seconds into the video.
ImageStabilization,300clf,pipnewman,1 point,Tue Mar 24 08:07:34 2015 UTC,Whoops!  Thanks for the heads up; fixed.
ImageStabilization,300clf,th30p3rat0r,5,Tue Mar 24 10:55:32 2015 UTC,That's cool as shit
ImageStabilization,300clf,Barb0,7,Mon Mar 23 15:16:08 2015 UTC,Stuff like this is the very reason I'm on this sub. Awesome.
ImageStabilization,300clf,rahmspinat,5,Mon Mar 23 19:53:46 2015 UTC,Looks like Frodo made it after all.
ImageStabilization,300clf,Spddracer,2,Mon Mar 23 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"If I had stood there on the mountain, I would be dead now."
ImageStabilization,300clf,rainman18,2,Tue Mar 24 08:33:45 2015 UTC,That makes two of us!
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,N8CCRG,12,Sun Mar 22 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"Lol he just tries to tear the GoPro open with his hind legs. So cute, and deadly!"
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,BabyCat6,12,Mon Mar 23 01:38:13 2015 UTC,Get this fucking thing off me so I can kill that damn red dot.
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,juksayer,9,Mon Mar 23 02:04:17 2015 UTC,there's no way this can be stabilized
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,ViciousNakedMoleRat,-1,Mon Mar 23 09:53:48 2015 UTC,"Unless the kitchen is changing shape throughout the video, this can be stabilized. What you mean is that it won't be simple. And that's what makes it worthwhile to some."
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,SkaMateria,4,Mon Mar 23 19:08:06 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure you you really want this stabalized. But I'll try and give it a shot after I get back from the airport.
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,Thefriendlyfaceplant,4,Mon Mar 23 12:37:29 2015 UTC,Stabilise on the red dot? That would be madness.
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,Roughy,7,Mon Mar 23 09:40:19 2015 UTC,That didn't go well as I had hoped: http://gfycat.com/HandmadeScrawnyIndianpalmsquirrel
ImageStabilization,2zycu4,Thefriendlyfaceplant,3,Tue Mar 24 03:32:42 2015 UTC,That's better than I had hoped!

ImageStabilization,2ztuwv,goofballl,4,Sun Mar 22 07:41:25 2015 UTC,Probably just looking for a blowhole.
ImageStabilization,2ztuwv,Ragnagord,2,Sun Mar 22 07:09:27 2015 UTC,Is that the dolphin equivalent of a blowjob?
