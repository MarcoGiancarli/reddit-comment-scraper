CodAW,3e31ka,The_Shreckoning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:31 2015 UTC,He said you would have to play at least 50 hours until you received a variant of the new weapons.   I'm well aware of the roughly 45 minute timer for regular SDs.

CodAW,3e31ka,42z3ro,4,Tue Jul 21 18:45:53 2015 UTC,They aren't ASD exclusive so it has nothing to do with money. You're not even required to pay for a DLC pack to use them.

CodAW,3e31ka,ACiDRiFT,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:18 2015 UTC,I don't have any AK12 Elites either. Its my favorite and most used gun. I don't really want the RIP because of its lower mag size though. My feeder has 49 w/ ext. mags. I don't think I could give that up. I do want the Finger Trap though. I find myself hip fire a LOT with the AK12.
CodAW,3e31ka,Allegiance10,5,Tue Jul 21 16:59:20 2015 UTC,If you want the finger trap you could just use the AK12 Wrecker while it only has +2 Handling you can put any attachments on it unlike the finger trap
CodAW,3e31ka,thevoidx1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:02 2015 UTC,Yeah the RIP isn't really worth the hype. It's a beautiful design though! I have the finger trap. I just hate not being able to add anything like a quickdraw grip or ext. mags. At least the iron sights are great on both variants.
CodAW,3e31ka,trehnert,3,Tue Jul 21 18:28:36 2015 UTC,That's so dumb. They kept advertising it to be the only one available to everyone and now they change it. At least that gun looked pretty bad anyways.

CodAW,3e3k2r,icedblackcoffee,11,Tue Jul 21 18:08:00 2015 UTC,"Well, if everybody keeps hating on shotguns, this is what you get. I remember some AW Gamescom footage where sbd used the Tac 19. He got like 2 point blank Hitmarkers and the guy doing the commentary and analyzing the gameplay said ""and here we see the OP Shotguns return. sigh"". Even guns like the remington were never OP."
CodAW,3e3k2r,FuXs-,12,Tue Jul 21 18:56:45 2015 UTC,90% of shotgun haters are AR/SMG users who can't stand being killed by something other than the same stuff they use.  The other 9% are snipers who hate having 1hk competition and the last 1% don't even play the game but just hear that shotguns are OP.
CodAW,3e3k2r,Shujinco2,4,Tue Jul 21 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, there are times when shotguns are simply WAY too powerful.  The SPAS in MW2 was super good, and I remember the KSG being exceptional if you could aim it.  But in this game, I'd agree that none of the shotguns feel op in any regard. At WORST the Tac19 is very good in Hardcore, but so is basically everything else."
CodAW,3e3k2r,TheNickster99,6,Tue Jul 21 19:24:07 2015 UTC,The KSG required actual skill because it only fired one slug bullet. It is far from op because if you missed your shot you were pretty much dead.
CodAW,3e3k2r,Tayette,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"Only in BO2. In MW3, it was a godly shotgun."
CodAW,3e3k2r,Somertonn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:44 2015 UTC,The mw3 KSG was too inconsistent at close range. Mw3 pumps suffered from not being 2 pellet kills at close range.
CodAW,3e3k2r,smoke3x14,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"It seems to me when I use the tac, I get hit markers point blank and when other people use it, I get killed from so far away in one shot."
CodAW,3e3k2r,ScruffyScruffs,2,Tue Jul 21 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"The R870 was the most annoying gun from BO2 for me. It's probably just because of how quickly you die. I think it's pretty well balanced, but it still pisses me the fuck off sometimes."

CodAW,3e3k2r,Bleak5170,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:22:41 2015 UTC,Nice stats.  Where did you pull those out from?  Your ass?  I hate shotguns for none of the reasons you listed.
CodAW,3e3k2r,Bleak5170,5,Tue Jul 21 21:53:06 2015 UTC,"I pulled them from experience as well as watching youtubers. I suppose you're going to claim that shotguns take no skill just because they require a different set of skills than regular weapons. You're going to claim they are OP even though they are almost NEVER used in search & destroy, a game mode where people only use the best of the best when it comes to weapons.  Tell me, shotgun hater, what are your most used variants? Mine are the sledgehammer, mancy, propipe, spanner, and pain and suffering. Take note of the lack of overused BS (with the one exception being that the sledgehammer is one of the most popular tac19s)."
CodAW,3e3k2r,The_Shreckoning,3,Tue Jul 21 22:21:03 2015 UTC,I think they just intended for this gun to be a novelty weapon. Not one that you'll use except when you want to mess around.
CodAW,3e3k2r,BlazeDemBeatz,0,Tue Jul 21 18:44:41 2015 UTC,"It's not even usable as a novelty though. This gun is prepatch executioner bad. M1 irons non-akimbo can arguably be a novelty, but that gun is at least usable as a novelty weapon."
CodAW,3e3k2r,imrlybord7,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:35 2015 UTC,Hmmm....kind of odd how a pretty much useless weapon makes it through the testing stages. Of course we area talking about a COD with possible the worst weapon balance of all time. I swear I don't even bother using 85% of them.
CodAW,3e3k2r,Hypobromite,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:28 2015 UTC,Worst weapon balance of all time   lmao what is mw2 and mw3  Also implying this game's guns arent balanced
CodAW,3e3k2r,VoiD_Glitch,2,Tue Jul 21 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"I think even if I get one I won't be using it. Maybe just to goof around with as a secondary overkill weapon. Only way I could see it working is flipping to it when you walk thru a hallway, getting one kill and flipping back to regular weapon."
CodAW,3e3k2r,Hypobromite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:29 2015 UTC,"Oh good, the Blunderbuss is exactly as useless as I expected it to be."
CodAW,3e3k2r,Suppa_Chill,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"The issue with the Blunderbuss is mainly the hipfire. They gave it the damage profile of the TAC-19 (50-30-10 on each pellet). It has approximately 2.25x the pellets of a TAC-19. However, it was given 2.25x the hipfire radius of the TAC. This means that it has 5.06x the hipfire spread of the TAC, effectively making it 225% less able to get one shot kills at any range the TAC can. It also has the same range as the TAC (which you wouldn't expect of a Blunderbuss). It is just very wonky. Just imagine it with Gung-Ho."
CodAW,3e3k2r,Johtoboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"And this is why they need to reduce the spread of the blunderbluss by 40%. At a max spread of 12 or 13 it would be high risk, high reward one-shot shotgun. Yes, it would piss some people off with the resulting lucky longshots, but it would still have the huge weakness of a very low effective fire rate."
CodAW,3e3k2r,ScruffyScruffs,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it should be used to rush big targets like a Goliath. Also, it definitely does have a lot of spread and four second reload time."
CodAW,3e3k2r,nathancrook,2,Tue Jul 21 18:46:48 2015 UTC,Imagine hitting all your pellets on a Goliath. 50 damage times 18 (20 with the Royalty or Dragonfire) = instant Goliath kill (900-1000 damage total).

CodAW,3e2fbh,gorkye,4,Tue Jul 21 13:02:19 2015 UTC,"Despite all of the glitches associated with Gung-Ho, I still think it's the best Tier 2 perk in the game for aggressive rushers. I use it for the vast majority of my classes. Nothing beats being able to redact instantly in a face-to-face gunfight, where every millisecond counts.  The ADS delay can be avoided simply by getting out of a sprint before you ADS."
CodAW,3e2fbh,PuddingAuxRais1ns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:02 2015 UTC,"The first one almost never happens to me. Like definitely low single digit instances over a massive amount of use.  The weird animation is annoying, but I'm pretty sure your spread still reduces to 0 in the same amount of time. If you shoot a bullet during the hiccup it lands dead center.  ADSing ends your slide. When finishing a slide I'm pretty sure you stop shooting briefly even if you're hip firing.  The animation thing is bad but not a huge deal, except in the case of the shield. That's awful. I don't use the shield so I didn't know that problem existed.  I don't know anything about those sound bugs. If they exist then FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU-"
CodAW,3e2fbh,imrlybord7,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"The ADS slide one I think is a bug because if you keep hip firing your gun doesn't stop shooting.  The first one is anoying because it tells enemies were you are if you don't have a silencer, putting you at risk.  You really have to pay atention to the noise the exos normally make and the killcams to notice the bug.  I became fully aware of it on infected getting stabed in the back and seeing in the killcam the infected dashing at me from behind. I had a headset and I didn't hear a thing...and sometimes you can hear people boosting on the other side of the map. I bet some more deaths happened because of this and could have been prevented if it worked like it should.  Like you said the animation thing is not a really big deal but the fact they don't appear properly is proof of laziness...I mean...I am still getting killed by people covering their face with their hand and with their guns aiming to the ground, because they got hit by stuns but they were not blind at all (this has been around since Modern Warfare 2, and probably earlier). Imagine if the shield really covered your body while sprinting...it would finally be somewhat usefull.  Animations need to be more precise showing what the enemy is really doing."
CodAW,3e2fbh,Jackamalio626,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"I just wish they'd make it so the BAL doesn't have that misleading fire rate. If it shoots at 600-720 rpm, don't make it sound like it fires at 720-800."

Someone made a video recently showing it takes you longer to ADS with gung ho.  Also the audio bugs are terrible too. An example lastnight I'm on the roof on riot and I hear an enemy Exo boost up and I know he's coming up to the roof. So I try to be sneaky and surprise him thinking I'm gonna hide behind the AC and sneak him. No second Exo  boost sound. All of a sudden he is behind me and rabbit punches me lol.  I experience the gunshot bugs also. Can't hear guns sometimes.  So with these bugs generally being old, they still exist and yet they're worried about selling new guns thru the lotto system."

If I'm alone it becomes a struggle so I often play in a party when I play for score streaks they make the game fun for me.  However if we are struggling in a game or lose I for less stress I will quite happily switch to a class with all support and then will rush everywhere and just go all out gun kills if there are 3 guys in a spawn I'm going in! No need to worry about a score streak! So a good UAV with extended time, orbital care package double tap better odds (generally decent items come out) and a sentry gun with added stuff so I do not control it.  I do really enjoy playing this way. And I understand what you mean. For me playing with score streaks from my care package at random some which I do not normally use can make it fun too.  Why it is more fun is because normally I go UAV with extra time and extra points (just to help me really to lead into my score streaks), system hack, warbird and paladin.  When I go support I go with threat detection and extra time and support. And I can get points to make sure its always up. Makes running and gunning so much easier."
CodAW,3e3g2p,its_only_pauly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"Killstreaks shouldn't be in Call of Duty, it should be all about that gun on gun action. Thankfully next year we'll get the OP treyarch streaks and specialist streaks which will reduce gun on gun fights even more...  I can earn them, it just isn't very skilled or rewarding to kill defenseless opponents from way up in the air.  I mean if you have to have streaks just go 3/5/7 like COD4 and make them ground streaks. The Goliath would be fun if it wasn't a terrible streak, the air-based streaks are always the best and they are very boring..."

Guess what, so is the tac19 haymaker. In a game with hundreds of variants there are bound to be a bunch of useless ones.  I'd rather they focus on balancing the base guns and elite variants."
CodAW,3e2po7,icedblackcoffee,3,Tue Jul 21 14:53:35 2015 UTC,A 3 shot kill weapon with a decent fire rate and extremely low recoil would be insanely OP.
CodAW,3e2po7,Jackamalio626,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:43 2015 UTC,"It would only be a 3 shot kill up to 400 units, so a relatively short 3hk range, but enough to allow it to compete with the bal, hbr, and asm1."
CodAW,3e2po7,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"True, but the BAL only gets a three shot kill up to 200 units. Double that three shot range, and add the superior fire rate and great accuracy, and you have the BAL pre-nerf.  The AK is supposed to superb at medium and long distances. Even now, the gun is not terrible up close, hipfiring is pretty effective. Making it dominate up close as well would push it over the edge."
CodAW,3e2po7,Jackamalio626,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"So how about buffing the close range damage to 34, but reducing close range to 300 (the 2 pellet kill range of the tac19 w/out AR).  Keep in mind that the STG-44 also is a 3hk (up to 650) and fires at 750."

The Super Serum, the Bombs on Sideshow, the stuff from Ghosts. All of it. It's ridiculous enough how out of place these things are in a twitch shooter, and it's even worse you can get these things from A CARE PACKAGE (except the bombs on Sideshow).   One kinda cool way they could go about it in the future is if there is a map streak, make it so you have to go on a kill streak or score streak to achieve it. You wouldn't select the streak before the match as it's available to anyone who hits that streak in-game. Camping is virtually non-existent in AW, so camping for the streaks wouldn't really be a thing.   It'd have to be easier than a DNA Bomb but way more difficult than using better odds or re-rolling care packages."

CodAW,3e2kuk,purehatred89,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:04 2015 UTC,i think you have some unreasonable expectations then.  in fact it taking that long would tell me there are actually quite a few good games available and it is just taking a bit of time for them to match you with the best one.

Got some last night after finishing a daily challenge and went to the list and crickets.  This is the first CoD this has ever happened to me in.  Player counts must be terrible.

CodAW,3e1z8v,devmin99,2,Tue Jul 21 12:43:31 2015 UTC,He meant in HC only
CodAW,3e1z8v,akapixelrat,5,Tue Jul 21 12:49:49 2015 UTC,"In this game hardcore seems to be treated like the second class citizens.  A lot of the ""balance"" changes they made have really negatively impacted hardcore.  One that comes to mind is the flak jacket changes.  These days hardcore is nothing but grenade launchers, na45's, and danger close.  There is just no counter to it.  Tons of trolls team killing or reverse boosting in matches.  EM1 variants are completely nuts in hardcore, Spawns are some of the worst ever.  The list goes on.  The big problem I notice is how inconsistent it is.  Hit detection and general lag issues show up huge in hardcore.  There are times that you will literally spawn into the death animation because the enemy could see you before you spawned/had control on your end.  It's crazy how often you die without a chance or any recourse.  I don't mind dying if I'm playing bad, but the game comes off as broken or unfair.  That's a problem.  My friends and I play mostly hardcore, they've mostly all stopped playing at this point or gone back to BO2.  We've been playing hardcore together since late in MW2 and this one has been the worst by far.  I'm not sure they could fix it correctly in a reasonable way and at this point it's clear they wouldn't want to anyway.  Player count seems crazy low on hardcore these days so sledgehammer won't be bothered."
CodAW,3e1z8v,icedblackcoffee,3,Tue Jul 21 13:11:04 2015 UTC,"I think one gun that needs to be reworked for both HC and Core is the AE4. It would be better for core and more balanced for HC if they did they following:   removed ads spread reduced damage to 34-33-28 added a 1.1 chest and neck multi   This way the gun would:   be more useful in core at long range due to the removal of ads spread, which is needed with the introduction of the STG44 and the existence of the HBRa3. be more useful in core at midrange due to the 1.1 chest and neck multi be less OP in HC because it would only be a 1hk at all ranges if you hit them at the head, chest, or neck (which is balanced for a slow, but full-auto gun) make the lower damage variants more usable with the 1.1 chest and neck multi, so this way a gun like the shocker is more likely to still be a 4hk at midrange and long range.   Other guns that should have their damage buffed for HC:   MP Grach should be buffed to 50-30-20 so that the feeling lucky is useful for sniping people IMR should be buffed to 35-30-24 so that it's more usable in HC Bulldog should have its max damage range increased to 250"

CodAW,3e1z8v,6_1_5,2,Tue Jul 21 10:18:38 2015 UTC,"For me, it's two things in AW HC:  NoobTubes for sure. I don't remember them being so prevalent in other CODs HC, but maybe they were. OP: Don't bother with flak Jacket, its totally useless in HC.  Personally I can only play HC for about three matches, till I get too pissed.   The second thing is this:  Lately, I've had team mates that just use an emp grenade at the beginning of the match  right at our spawn point, I guess to delay the rest of the team from a quick start.  Really pisses me off and I team kill the bitches when I can figure out who did it."

CodAW,3e1z8v,OMGitsAfty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:14:02 2015 UTC,"The worst gun in HC for me is the MP11, it's just melts at all ranges, means you can run around the map faster and is quick to draw, most games I get into have 3 or 4 people running it."
CodAW,3e1z8v,McTwizle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:40 2015 UTC,I can confirm the MP11 is a beast in HC.  I run around with the Plunderer in HCKC (when I can find a game).  Put on overclock and cloak and I feel like a Usain Bolt/Predator hybrid for 20 seconds.  Good for a few kills and tags every spawn.
CodAW,3e1z8v,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:29:23 2015 UTC,"Doing Camo challenges for pistols the last few days so I been fiddling with hardcore the last few days. I learned not to play HC TDM mode. This is where I found more corner campers than any mode in the game. Hc Dom and KC weren't nearly as bad for this. Secondly there is something really different with spawning in HC. I could be doing semi decent and be positive on my score, then all of a sudden it will leave me spawning in the open in the middle of solar in the pool getting spawn trapped over and over. I counted one match after noticing how bad it was and got spawn killed 14 times in a match before even moving 5 footsteps. I had shit happen where I'd spawn in with enemies looking at me, and few occasional spawns where I'd spawn with enemies having their back turned to me right in front of me. One guy was literally in punching range when I spawned in. Third thing is because of how fast you die it can make the lag comp so much worse. I have had a lot of lag comp issues in core so I become accustomed to it. at least in core u have the kill cam to verify if your being lag comped. HC there's no way to determine. Also agree w what someone said about the Grach pistol. This is what I'm currently using and it's crazy cuz I can shoot people across sideshow with one shot sometimes and then sometimes at close range it becomes a hitmarker machine. It should always be a one shot kill IMO."

CodAW,3e1z8v,Next1306,3,Tue Jul 21 10:29:25 2015 UTC,"Mostly HC player here.  Since I don't have a decent connection (especially if compared to NA connection -which I'm often paired with even if I'm playing solo-) and a not so good aim at long range having a 2SK really help and prevent me from get killed by an enemy even when I'm on target (prom my PoV) and I shot first.  Yesterday I was playing with some members of my clan (they're located in NA and that's probably why we were paired mostly with US and Canadian player) and the hit detection just sucked for me: it took me 2, or 3 burst in some cases, to get a kill at low-medium range with an ARX (even at point blank I couldn't take a 1BK); If we were on HC I would probably won 60% of the gunfight I've lose in core.  Sorry for bad english :("
CodAW,3e1z8v,ozarkslam21,2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:03 2015 UTC,"It is way more fun for me to not have to put 100 bullets in someone before they die.  Puts more emphasis on having fast reaction time and precise aim.  Seems like a lot less problems with lag because of the fast TTK, there are less times where a kill might be affected by lag.  Just a few of the reasons i prefer it.  Not to mention that contrary to this OP's post, I think that almost any gun is viable in HC. much better variety"

CodAW,3dypdf,drunk3nm0nk3y,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:28 2015 UTC,I agree. I don't use burst weapons often though. IMO burst weapons shouldn't be in the SMG category. Do you think they'll add the attachment in Black Ops 3 for fire mode? I thought it was great in BO2
CodAW,3dypdf,Tayette,7,Mon Jul 20 18:26:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't diss my Chicom. That thing was awesome. I couldn't get a feel for other SMGs, but that thing hit the spot."
CodAW,3dypdf,colin_7,2,Mon Jul 20 19:40:26 2015 UTC,I'm not dissing it! I really liked it too! I just had more fun using it with the select fire attachment for full auto fire lol.
CodAW,3dypdf,Tayette,3,Mon Jul 20 19:44:45 2015 UTC,The AMR9 just feels awkward. I think it's the delay between bursts.
CodAW,3dypdf,Disc_Hunt,5,Mon Jul 20 19:46:17 2015 UTC,"And the awkwardly long, slow burst to start with.  It's hard to get a feel for it when all previous burst-fires since CoD4 have been 3 shots, and 4-shots were rare. 5-shots at that slow RPM makes it hard to get past your muscle memory from the old M16s and FAMAS."
CodAW,3dypdf,suicidaljoker7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:35:17 2015 UTC,"I really dislike the recoil pattern on the AMR9, it's very wobbly and random. I find it harder to control than any other SMG in the game. Burst fire weapons should have improved recoil compared to fully automatic. In its defense, there isn't much vertical kick but horizontally the bullets are all over the place. It's almost like you're hipfiring when you're ADS. I can control vertical kick easily, in reasonable amounts, but the AMR9s recoil throws off my game big time."

CodAW,3dypdf,Johtoboy,4,Mon Jul 20 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'd like alternate fire mode variants for a lot of guns, it would be cool to have a semi-auto AK12 or auto MK14 or something. Select fire could also just be an attachment"
CodAW,3dypdf,Maschinengewehr,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:35 2015 UTC,alternate fire mode variants   Before the game released that's what I thought most variants would be. Not OP upgrades that render the base version obsolete.
CodAW,3dypdf,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:55 2015 UTC,"same with me. I think Team Fortress 2 has some cool variants too, but most of AW's are too much just direct upgrades from the base version."
CodAW,3dypdf,Terkey,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:39 2015 UTC,"Making a full auto variant would completely take away the purpose of the gun. Plus with full auto it would literally be an Asm1 just with less range.  I use the royalty(propipe) variant and find that to be really good. It has a further 3hk range than the base ARX and the propipe variant has higher midrange damage (only needs one headshot to be a 3hk up to 1024 on the propipe).  I think most of the hate for the weaker SMGs comes from the fact that they can't compete against the bal and asm1. If those two guns were nerfed you would see the weaker smgs shine a little better. Not that the sn6 doesn't need a buff, but the amr9 and sac3 are miles better than that piece of crap."
CodAW,3dypdf,macaronyboy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:14 2015 UTC,Amr9 is pretty good with rapid fire and adv rifling. The thing has almost no recoil

CodAW,3dy6rh,AnneFrankxGoku420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"The best advice for getting headshots and long shots is to play Hardcore Kill Confirmed or Domination.  Hardcore is a must.  For long shots, you may have to be a bit of a jerk and not play the objective, but it shouldn't take too awful long"
CodAW,3dy6rh,Hypobromite,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:35 2015 UTC,"Longshots: equip red dot/hybrid sight and aim down lanes. Detroit A to B comes to mind.  Headshots: Aim higher up, you might prefer to take potshots instead of full auto. Feel free to abuse idlers on the other team. Alternatively, just play. You'll luck out and get headshots sooner or later.  HCDOM also helps, since it's easier to kill people with pretty much every gun."
CodAW,3dy6rh,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:57:46 2015 UTC,"I did all the ARs in Hardcore. Definitely gonna want play HC for the longshots. Maps like Instinct, Sideshow, Greenband, and Solar are really great longshot maps. Just find long lines of sight (Instinct: on top of the temple, overlooking C from A. Sideshow: anywhere. Greenband: from any roof/window on one side of the map. Solar: that campy spot by B coming from C, the roof, the side opposite A roof). Contrary to popular belief, there is no tip for headshots. Just aim for the head. Maybe use the sight you're most comfortable with. The MK14 is awesome in HC after the latest patch. You will never not get a 1 shot kill in HC. However, since you're going for longshots, I would advise against the Eagle Eye. Use the Eclipse with a sight. For strafe kills, if they give you a lot of trouble, slap on a tube and kill people from the air (I know, it sucks). Dodging kills are easier than anything. Bloodthirsties require some skill, but you can always use the bloodthirsty glitch to get them (get 4 kills with one gun and get the fifth with the MK). No attachments and perks are easiest done in tandem (in HC, of course). Good luck!"

CodAW,3dy6rh,colin_7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:03 2015 UTC,Hardcore  Look at the stats chart and choose a variant that deals 30 or greater damage as far out as possible  The Bal 308 is a good choice for HC  HBRa3 Average Joe with foreground and quick draw is beastly  MK 14 Desecrator with quick draw and red dot is kingly in hardcore
CodAW,3dy6rh,HappyGangsta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:51 2015 UTC,"Long shots for the bal are probably the hardest due to its recoil, but it isn't impossible. Most people are saying hardcore and that's probably your best bet, but try to keep your distance from people. On Retreat there are always people on those platforms near the spawns, so you can usually get one or two quick picks here or there."
CodAW,3dy6rh,KSIXxChaoticxX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:08 2015 UTC,"For long shots, get thermal, and camp in the back of the map on Hardcore. For headshots, put on a RDS and aim for the head in hardcore. For the dogfight and strafes, jump every time you are about to get a kill."

CodAW,3dy6rh,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"MK14 - Hardcore all day. If you have it, the Desecrator is the best variant for Hardcore because of the lift on the fire rate limit (any +damage variant is unnecessary as it's a 1 shot kill at every range in HC).  Long shots - ALWAYS vote Sideshow, you can easily get 10+ long shots per match on that map.  Headshots - I know this may sound obvious, but just focus on only aiming high and they will come slowly, but they will come. Also, just forget about your K/D for the time being because it will only hinder you if you are attempting to go 2.0 each match instead of just going for the challenges."
CodAW,3dy6rh,JumpyPorcupine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:47 2015 UTC,You just need to use common sense for long shots. Every map has a few long lines of site. Get to those spots and just post down.

CodAW,3dwot1,Hypobromite,15,Mon Jul 20 03:59:35 2015 UTC,"I don't see how the STG is an ""average"" AR. Statistically speaking, the STG looks like the best AR in the game once it's out. It has the damage profile of the HBR with the fire rate of the AK. the STG is going to be a monster right out the gate, and will arguably give the Bal a run for it's money.  From what I have seen from /u/convery's leaks, the SVO actually has very significant vertical recoil. It kicks like a mule, it'll be impossible to land shots consecutively while firing at it's max fire cap. With that said though, I believe the SVO will be the best sniper rifle in the game once it's out."

CodAW,3dwot1,convery,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"While having the damage of the HBR, it still does have the fire rate of the AK/Bal. So, in terms of TTK, it is most like the Bal. However, it doesn't have an Inferno or a Steed. Sure, it will be pretty good. However, it'll really only be as good as the base Bal.  That's very odd, what you said about the SVO. According to the data, it has only horizontal recoil. You can check the chart yourself. It's quite puzzling."
CodAW,3dwot1,backstroker1991,0,Mon Jul 20 04:45:56 2015 UTC,I'm happy that the Vampire will be able to compete (to an extent) with the higher-tier variants of the STG. It's nice they continued the trend of having an enlisted variant being very good.

The problem is that with each subsequent patch, the pre-existing connectivity issues seem to become further exacerbated, and that's when being melted seems to be a problem. Most of the guns in the game don't have ridiculouly overpowered damage profiles. But we haven't really had a CoD game whose netcode is quite as problematic as this one (atleast from my own experience)."

I haven't found the level of competition to be significantly different. I also like the option to record screenshots and game clips (I don't know if the equivalent exists for PS4).

CodAW,3dw17h,HappyGangsta,3,Mon Jul 20 04:08:18 2015 UTC,It is only theoretical because it doesn't count for frame rounding and differing RPMs. If Treyarch is positive that their game has no frame rounding then BO3's can be actual but this frame rounding makes fire rates differ so much that theoretical is the only applicable calculation.

Im on board with playing it for a little bit, just to check the balance and flow of the game, but if people are giong to play it for like 7 days straight, they will ruin it for themselves. I am glad SHG is implementing new weapons, and still has another whole DLC to come out, keeping the game alive as long as they can. They really dont have to add this stuff for us but they are. While i know it is to increase some of the ASD sales, its still a nice thing to do on their part for everyone. bo3 is not a god game, it is just the next call of duty. it too will have a dying point, just like aw.

CodAW,3dx7mh,lonely-day,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:28 2015 UTC,I don't know if they've ever actually mentioned anything about spawn trapping but the various design elements added in previous games suggests that they don't like it.  They've definitely changed the spawn algorithms to allow spawns to flip in game much easier (specific to game modes like domination or TDM) or just spawn you closer to the action and MW2 had a deathstreak that essentially gave you double health (in my opinion I've always felt that was another counter measure to decrease spawn traps).  Spawn traps were absolutely disgusting in CoD 4 and even MW2/Black Ops 1 if you played CTF or demolition.

It's a grind so set it and forget it. You can place them on walls and ceilings to reduce the noticeability. You can also put them under/around/back bumper of cars but it's like fishing with no lure. HCDOM shoot them at enemies while they are capping instead of shooting them."

Detroit being the best for SnD, but by far and away HP and specifically riot work a treat.   Think about the entry points for enemies (even giving the spawns) then either throw a stun in or smoke. The HP are tiny on riot, even the 2nd hill which is on a roof gets a few. They jump up and trigger it off whilst headglitching and it goes off.   Get them in the right places and stay alive! Dont spawn in straight after dying too.  Early rotations, bombadier, danger close, smoke, fast hands low profile, blast suppressor all worked for me.  Its a must try.....  Good luck."
CodAW,3dx5r3,SosseGunnar,9,Mon Jul 20 07:14:27 2015 UTC,because the game stats are different from actual damage charts. the mors does 98 damage per shot and na45 does 30 damage. and the ravager only increases the maximum damage radius of the explosive shot of the na45. not the acutual damage of each shot

CodAW,3dstex,GamingMedicalGuy,6,Sun Jul 19 22:13:20 2015 UTC,I might give this a try. I remember seeing a thread on here with people initially suggesting it being a good idea as it would help them kill multiple people at once. They then realised it was really hard as they were used to always using the aim assist.  Yet they came to the conclusion that it could be ok with practice. There was a good player who had a youtube channel who never used aim assist.   How random information I read sticks in my head!
CodAW,3dstex,its_only_pauly,5,Sun Jul 19 03:11:51 2015 UTC,bruh i just realized i was using aim assist and once i turned it off i felt like a fraud lol
CodAW,3dstex,its_only_pauly,4,Sun Jul 19 03:27:01 2015 UTC,Some people have suggested that you play with no aim assist for an extended time say 1 hour for example. Get used to it without no aim assist and then put it back on and play and it is meant to make you more accurate when playing with aim assist on. And then the time can be cut back to say 20 minutes here and there to touch up.   How or if that works I have no idea give it a try and let me know.

CodAW,3dstex,d1rTb1ke,2,Sun Jul 19 04:35:54 2015 UTC,did this in hardcore for a little while because when you have 2 enemies in the sights sometimes the aim assist will pull you off the target. it helped but then i found it incredibly hard find targets that are exo-flying overhead.
CodAW,3dstex,Tenshi-01,2,Sun Jul 19 06:50:17 2015 UTC,"Well there are two types of aim assist in the game, and you can turn either one off. There is the one that follows targets and the other is the one that slows down over targets."

I honestly would recommend waiting 4 months for the release of BLOPS3. That's where you're going to see a large community because of the hype for the game and naturally because it's a new release.   I'm not sure how AW will do after the release of BLOPS3, it sort of seems like a 50/50 split on that game. Some people love it and will continue to play, some people won't pick it up again. If you can find AW for $30-40 then maybe give it a try if you're dying to get back into CoD right away, but I honestly don't think it's worth the full $60 for 4 months.   I think if you're looking for something similar to World at War, your best shot is probably Battlefield. It's not the same era, but it will play rather similar. Other than that, it's going to be 3+ years until CoD makes a return to an older era game, even then it's still an IF type situation."

Double jump is just one part of how the introduction of exoskeleton have changed the game.  You also get in air movement, dashing and dive kicks. You also get the chose from a range of exo ability such as turning invisible or moving faster.  Because of the way the maps are built, maps that felt big before feels smaller because of the level of movement introduced into the game. Not just sliding haha.

CodAW,3draqk,BrigadierBongLord,6,Sat Jul 18 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"Well, even if that were true, I'm using a glitch called Strafe Jumping to travel much faster than you're ordinarily able to. This glitch originates from the game that CoD's engine was originally built off of: Quake 3 Arena, which features strafe jumping heavily at every level of competitive play.. as a basic movement mechanic that everyone is expected to learn.  Regardless, you should keep in mind that every single player has access to the same movement options in AW, making the game faster all around - but certainly not without strategy, if both teams have coordination."
CodAW,3draqk,MrazikMJ,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:35:04 2015 UTC,Strafe jumping...  This glitch looks similar to Bhopping featured in Garry's Mod and Counterstrike. I didn't realize you could do it in call of duty too.Do they work in a similar way?
CodAW,3draqk,joziunderground,2,Sun Jul 19 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, almost identical.  You can do it in most Cods"
CodAW,3draqk,Somertonn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:22:48 2015 UTC,do you know if this is possible on console?
CodAW,3draqk,DudeBeerBro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"It should be. The glitch just involves controlling your mid-air acceleration, and jumping repeatedly to keep the speed. Search up 'Quake 3 Strafe Jumping' and try to apply that information to the analog sticks on the controller - the same technique is used on AW. it'll be harder, probably.. but certainly not impossible."
CodAW,3draqk,TheEndlessPath666,-2,Sun Jul 19 23:53:32 2015 UTC,"honestly I never watched the video before commenting, but exos are very annoying imo and in that video you used it maybe 3 times at most. Was certainly interesting to see."

No mis-timed jumps, barely any speed loss... it felt good. I even got a knife kill at the end of it!  The sheer speed of it should emphasize why you ought to learn how to perform this kind of movement."

CodAW,3dtsvu,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:23:13 2015 UTC,It cuts the time is supply Drops in half that you receive from playing. So rather than 45 min. You'll get a supply drop at 22.5 min. Of gameplay

CodAW,3dtqhc,TruthBeToldAsshole,6,Sun Jul 19 11:03:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know about an upgrade to magazine size. The S12 is already pretty bonkers as it is. However, I do think an increase in default ammo capacity is a good idea. As for the slugs, I very much doubt that they'll implement that with just a few months left and no highly visible demand for them, but we are getting new guns this week or sometime soon, so I wouldn't totally consider it a lost cause."
CodAW,3dtqhc,JediMindTrxcks,2,Sun Jul 19 13:17:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only thing the s12 needs is for its ammo to be upgraded from 8 to 12 so that extended mags isn't a necesity.  The bigger problem is the bulldog. Statistically speaking the s12 renders it completely useless. Then for smaller problems there would be the tac19 and blunderbluss, both of which have too big a spread for 1hk shotguns."
CodAW,3dtqhc,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"The shotguns are certainly garbage in this game. I thought OP meant the S12 should get a major increase in magazine size — to 20, for example — instead of just to 12. That would be fine. The Bulldog is garbage because you pretty much need to have the Face Hammer or the other one (Rifled?) for it to be somewhat near viable. Also, 25 double kills for extended mags? What were they thinking?"
CodAW,3dtqhc,JediMindTrxcks,3,Sun Jul 19 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the s12 is good with extended mags. But the rest are way to inconsistent. The problem is that the cod community is full of players that find dying to shotguns to be annoying so they assume that shotguns are OP."
CodAW,3dtqhc,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"I don't approve of OHKO weapons in general. Even in Halo, I hated the shotgun. I tolerated the sniper because at least there you ALWAYS need a headshot"
CodAW,3dtqhc,MisterLemon,3,Mon Jul 20 03:18:51 2015 UTC,"The ohm actually has more than two downsides over the s12:   worse sprintout time (this is a big one) worse ads time even with lightweight the ohm moves slower than the s12 that -100 firerate is nothing to scoff at. BTW, rapid fire reduces range which is a no no for a shotgun   That being said the s12 should have its ammo increased to 12 default so that extended mags isn't such a necesity.  The better comparison to make would be the bulldog and the s12. The bulldog has worse max damage range and takes only 1 less pellet to kill at each range compared to the s12, which is worthless when you consider the fire rate of the s12 is much faster. The bulldog also has a smaller magazine size. It would make sense knowing this for SHG to do the following for the bulldog:   reduce/fix the gung ho spread so that it's the same as other shotguns increase the max damage range to 250 increase magazine size to 8 default tighten ads spread by 20%   Then there are the tac19 and blunderbluss, both of which have too wide a spread for a 1hk shotgun. They should do the following to balance those two:   decrease tac19 hipfire and ads spread by 20-30% decrease blunderbluss hipfire and ads spread by 40%"
CodAW,3dtqhc,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:39:31 2015 UTC,Doesn't the ohms shotgun wallbang though?
CodAW,3dtqhc,BasedGodCrim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:06:09 2015 UTC,Yes it has better penetration. Not that useful a trait in this game though.
CodAW,3dtqhc,icedblackcoffee,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:54 2015 UTC,"You can solve the sprint-out time with Gung-Ho. I don't have the Ohm, so I don't know how it affects the spread, though.  ADS is rarely used on shotguns.  But yeah, they're not exactly alike, but pretty similar. Enough to warrant attention."
CodAW,3dtqhc,Tayette,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"ADS is most certainly used on shotguns in this game. It's extremely useful for midrange shots. Gung-Ho makes the spread of shotguns 20, except for the bulldog for which it makes the spread much larger.  Again, you're focusing on the wrong gun. The s12 could maybe use a small ammo buff to 12 default, but the real step-child is the bulldog."
CodAW,3dtqhc,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"From the beginning shotguns have been broken, and the way the game plays there is no reason to use a shotgun over an smg/ar.  There are simply better choices for every map and game mode.  By far the most frustrating aspect of using a shotgun is the HUGE inconsistency in the TTK.  Literally will be standing right next to someone and it takes 2+ hits with the Tac-19 to send an enemy to their grave."
CodAW,3dtqhc,PopeLeoVII,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:01 2015 UTC,If you're going to use lightweight on the ohm then you could use it on the s12 also so you cant compare it that way. But the ohm with lightweight would still be 92% movement speed and the s12 is 100% without lightweight. Plus if you're using the s12 you probably are using the whirlwind or tiger blood which has a fire rate of 705-750.
CodAW,3dtqhc,42z3ro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:12:38 2015 UTC,Well first of all not everyone has the DLC
CodAW,3dtqhc,agarret83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:42 2015 UTC,"The S12 is fine as is. It can kill up to a decent range by firing a full magazine, and it kills fast close up. The least popular shotgun is for sure the bulldog.  I'm not in favor of fixing perceived disadvantages on each gun. Balance is more interesting if each gun has strengths and weaknesses (part of the problem with the strongest guns in the game is that they have few weaknesses)."
CodAW,3dtqhc,proteins247,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying is you're more in favor of nerfing stronger guns than buffing weaker guns?  I see your point, but the problem with say, the bulldog is that it's not a perceived disadvantage but a factual/comparitive disadvantage. Give me one good reason to use the bulldog over the s12. Same with the blunderbluss, which will have the same pellet to spread ratio as the tac-19, but only 10 rounds and an RPM of 13.3"
CodAW,3dtqhc,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:32 2015 UTC,"I did say that the bulldog is the weakest/least popular of the three shotguns. I was trying to say that the S12 is fine as is. I'm going to speculate that the bulldog is more consistent than the S12 in the medium-damage ranges because the S12 has unpredictable recoil at times. It wouldn't hurt anything to add 50 inches to D1 for the bulldog I guess.  Generally, for balance, I would support nerfing stronger guns. People hate getting ""melted"" and seem to prefer high TTK (more time). At least, if I worked at SHG, that's what I would go for.  Re. blunderbuss. Idk. It'll probably be weak. I was going to say that you probably have to ADS with it, but the raw data on Marvel's stat sheet gives the Blunderbuss an ADS hipsread of 15, as opposed to 5-5.5 for the other shotguns. I always thought it was more of a gimmick weapon like the M1 though."
CodAW,3dtqhc,proteins247,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"Bulldog needs more than a 50 increase in its max damage range considering the s12 does its max damage out to 225. A 100 increase makes more sense.  And no, the bulldog is not more consistent than the s12. Less recoil, yes, but I constantly find myself having to hit someone 3-5 times in order to kill them in smg range, which is why I think the ammo should be buffed the 8 and the ads spread reduced to 4."

CodAW,3dtqhc,jbirdjustin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:49 2015 UTC,It does that in zombies. It goes from 80/240 to 20 or 30 out of 90(?) when you swap to shotgun mode. The fire rate is a lot slower too.
CodAW,3dtqhc,galaxie5OO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's where I got the idea from. I think the multiplayer version should work exactly like that too."
CodAW,3dtqhc,jbirdjustin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:26:16 2015 UTC,Would make sense if shotgun mode used more ammo per trigger pull. Say each trigger pull burned 5 or 8 ammo so you could only have 5 or 8 shots in shotgun mode before reloading.

I think overall I prefer the Grach, with the PDW a close second. I recommend using akimbo and extended mags, plus gung ho. The Atlas 45 Huckleberry is great with this setup, almost like the M1 Irons, but you trade more ammo for less damage.  The RW1 is great if you have a variant with increased damage. I recommend an optical sight and advanced rifling. I've heard people call it a pocket Mors and it is very similar. It rewards accuracy so I like to play it slower and flank.  Whichever pistol you pick, you should have fun, they were honestly not as bad as people claimed before the buff. I plan on picking them up again soon to get 500 kills with each."

I've seen a lot of people using the 45 with some success.   The Grach can kill really fast now. I have been using the One Wood one without any attachments and have gotten a lot of kills with it.   PDW is pretty much a primary if you use akimbo on the Condensed one."

CodAW,3dt033,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:00:14 2015 UTC,You would have to change those settings on your monitor for color correction and contrast (I don't know what else he was using but those two are generally the most common).

I finished all the other Lynx camo challenges playing HCDOM (thermal sight for long shots) but came up about 26 short on headshots. I got those in around 5 games of Ground War. I'm on Atlas 20mm headshots at the moment, and I've yet to find the best setup & game mode. Sticking with Ground War at the moment but only getting 1 or 2 per game - very slow progress!!"

I got one Paladin very shortly after reading that Riot was best and you needed to soften it up with an LMG. Got it first attempt. About 1000 matches ago.

To play with the most people, either download ALL of the DLC (to play with season pass holders, which there are a lot of) or remove your DLC to play with the people who don't have any (also a lot of people). Since you only can make matches with people who have the exact same DLC as you, your best bet is to either have all of the DLC or non of it to be able to make matches with the most people. I have all of the DLC and have no issues making matches."

CodAW,3dr6rt,ELFYY_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:16:52 2015 UTC,"Well the problem is a lot of people don't own atlas gorge, so it minimizes the number of lobbies you can be matched up to if you do own it."
CodAW,3dr6rt,BlazeDemBeatz,0,Sat Jul 18 19:19:23 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of season pass holders, therefore a lot of atlas gorge owners, and there are the people who bought it separately.

CodAW,3dr6rt,ELFYY_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. It should just be made as a free bonus map. I can't picture many people paying for the map at this point. I only reccomend it because my matchmaking pool went from like 1/2, 1/1 at times when I downloaded Atlas Gorge. After I removed it went back to much higher MM like 1/28 1/47 etc. and that's with owning DLC 1 and 2. DLC 3 won't alter the matchmaking pool until it's released into the main playlists."
CodAW,3dr6rt,BlazeDemBeatz,3,Sat Jul 18 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"Put it like this, right now in regular rotation here are the pools :  Core maps only.  Core maps + Atlas Gorge  Core maps + Havoc  Core maps + Ascendance  Core maps + Atlas Gorge + Havoc  Core maps + Atlas Gorge + Ascendance  Core maps + Havoc + Ascendance  Core maps + Havoc + Ascendance + Atlas Gorge  That's a total of 8 different matchmaking pools, throw in SBMM and 5 different platforms, and you can see why people think this game is dead, things like bonus maps and SBMM are spreading the population too thin, and it's only going to hurt CoD in the long run."
CodAW,3dr6rt,ELFYY_,2,Sat Jul 18 19:34:42 2015 UTC,You are absolutely correct and breaking that down like that makes me realize how bad that really is. And think too when the next DLC goes into population those numbers will decrease even more. Ur gonna get people who'll have DLC 1 and 3 and by the time DLC 4 hits local pools it's gonna be like playing a daily 3 lotto combination.

It bothers me when I sit up late on my weekend and I can't get a game. In nothing at all. Domination takes us 5-10 minutes to find a lobby and then we can't leave the lobby and hope that no one drops out.  If I get a supply drop challenge and it involves momentum or CTF etc etc I can't do it unless I manage to party up with someone who has no DLC at all.   If we had no DLC we could play all game modes fine.

CodAW,3ds1e9,Allegiance10,2,Sat Jul 18 22:19:05 2015 UTC,"so the whole last prestige i pretty much used the lynx and have a lot of fun with it.  I am defiantly more aggressive than what you sound like. i have the tack driver, quarter back, improved action and worst of all the kingpin (just keep for how bad it is). i used to use the base, was good, then i started using the gun a lot more once i got the tack driver cause its supposed to be good. don't find it that great really. if your one of those moldy dark corner people maybe its good for you, same with the quarter back, but i really like the improved action (IA). most variants have less fire rate and i find i over sample it really easily and its quite annoying and the IA helps. all other variants are shit.  I play with it as a semi auto assault rifle and I never sit aiming down sights waiting for people i don't know are there and i do keep my distance, and that's why i like the irons. they are quite open and the fore post is almost see through and it gives you great viability but i could see this being annoying if not playing close to the screen, bad vision or don't know where the center of the screen is. I can do fairly well with this gun but it is by no means a high scoring gun unless you are quite skilled, which i am not. so things like blind eye, low profile and hardwired are good because you might do bad some games and just get spammed with stuff. Hard wired could be changed but i really fing hate the sound from system hacks as i have a large surround sound system (7.1) and play quite loud so it gets really annoying, plus i couldn't really see someone going on a 10+ streak consistently enough to warrant scavenger unless you have no thumbs and toughness is ...   got 2 of them but the 1st is way better imo. on this class you could ditch the extended mags and rock more streaks or w/e but those 4 rounds are great and makes scavenger not needed imo.   lynx improved action - irons, extended mags, and stock ( a must with irons) low profile, lightweight blind eye blast suppressor, hard wired uav - scramble, threat, support   second is with the same perks and gun but with extended mags and thermal and run w/e else you want. maybe lower streaks or overclock and another streak. the thermal on this gun is really good. it doesn't kick half as much and that makes it really great.  anyway, good luck. let me know if you find some good stuff for it as i find it really fun. if your trying for diamond i don't have more than 10 longshots and have over 1k kills with it so ... yeah. i get shots that i think i quite long but never get anything, dunno what up with that. really, i shoot people edge of the map to the other side and get nothing. as for the other guy who replied with 6-9 a match i find that highly unlikely. i have gotten 6-9 in a match but definatly not every. maybe on average 1~3 unless you really try for it."
CodAW,3ds1e9,attainableapex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:49 2015 UTC,Thank* you for the well thought out post! I do not use a variant currently (as I only have the Kingpin and Tack Driver).

I have a good sense for the center of the screen. for reference i have 6k kills with the mors irons (played one shot until i could get them) and 5k with the ak12 irons. i also like the sn6 (these are great, but not so powerfull)  and m1 irons but only have like 1k kills with them.   how far from your tv/monitor do you sit? you got to get a good view. i play on a 27"" monitor and maybe like 3' away from my desk. i like being close and find bigger screens weird because most of the time its for movies/tv so you want to be comfortable which leads to sitting farther and viewing under center point of the screen. at my desk my eyes on my 27's are about 3"" bellow the top of the screen when working and when i play i am pretty much centered up. if you are playing on a desk a fully movable ergotron arm (~$100) is amazing. bought one more on a whim and then bought 3 more for my desk, totally worth it.   *edit: 4' to 3'"

(I just found it really easy) and any other attachments but do not use supressor as it makes headshots 2 hit kills which is what you don't want.   Perks were Lightweight, Fast hands and scavenger. (This is my Default goto perks. You can change to what you like)   Exo ability for the play style (more on that later on) use Overclock the one that makes you run faster so you can get into the action quicker.  Game mode I played was core domination. The reason for this is because I usually play domination so u could predict player movements effectively and spam hotpots with my sniper.   TIPS:    Run into the action and just spam.  I found this really helpful and i got a fair amount of headshots this way. If that doesn't work take your time and be calm and aim for the head usually on B flag for domination  ACOG sight works beautiful but it also matters about the reticle in my opinion. Do not use the default reticle as it is too obstructive. I found the Horizontal or Clown reticles the best to use.   GOOD LUCK! :)  (p.s. iron sights are not as good as I thought.  I did better with ACOG. Must just be me getting used to it though)"

Basically, even as a hardcore only player, it's not very good. In the SMG category, the MP 11 Goliath, ASM 1, and KF 5 are all vastly superior to the SN6; the AMR is marginally superior; and only the abomination that are the SAC3's are worse than the SN6.  Most ARs in the game can be used as a better SMG than theSN6.  While you CAN have some good games and do 'ok' with the SN6, once you've completed all of it's challenges and go back to the Goliath, you'll feel like you just activated God Mode."

I swear though, that amr9 is just terrible. on the sac3's, which i like, i had a hard time getting the head shots but getting any of the amr9 stuff was just a terrible grind."
CodAW,3dsf1l,attainableapex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:37:53 2015 UTC,I'd place it at 6th honestly. The sac3s have a better combined firerate and can be used for close range while the amr9 has a 3hk range that makes better at hipfire than the sn6 and midrange damage and fire rate that allows it to be spammable for midrange.

Honestly, play as if you have a shotgun and it will melt people are super close range. I use the SN6-K (decrease damage, increase fire rate) at face value it looks terrible but it really does melt at close range.    Anything at medium ranges, good luck, even if you have first shot you're still lucky if you can get the kill.  But I urge everyone to use the SN6,  Its a really fun weapon to use and you make people rage as they turn the corner and you can hipfire them to death before they can shoot."

CodAW,3dsf1l,jbirdjustin,6,Sun Jul 19 00:35:16 2015 UTC,"It's okay, but there is literally no reason to use it over the other smgs. They should reduce the recoil, increase the magazine size to 40, and make the intro firerate 1800 so that it's more notable (this wouldn't be OP because it's just the first 3 rounds of a burst that go 1800)."
CodAW,3dsf1l,icedblackcoffee,2,Sun Jul 19 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"Its good if you use it right. Don't rush too hard and try to keep your distance form others. Not too far, as it is an SMG after all. If you want to rush, I recommend rapid fire and suppressor."

CodAW,3dsfco,_Swae_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"Well the exo movements make it much more fast paced. I think you cap the flags faster in Momentum as well, and the flag radius is smaller in Momentum I believe"
CodAW,3dsfco,backstroker1991,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:29:00 2015 UTC,"From what I can remember (I loved War in WaW), the spawns were a whole lot less random back then. That weird thing where you could be down to your last flag and spawn at the opposite at the map never happened in WaW. You could get spawn trapped really hard, but you would still stand a chance of getting the last flag."
CodAW,3dsfco,JediMindTrxcks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"War (essentially Momentum for those new to the series) was always one of the three or four most popular modes in the games in which it was featured. It was so popular there were petitions for companies to put it into the game in MW2, BO1, and BO2. For some reason, however, it just feels less fun in this game. I don't know if it has to do with the exo suits, which I somewhat doubt because the rest of the game has exo suits and I don't find the rest of the game boring, but I do find Momentum to be more boring than stuff like Ground War and Domination. It's not a lack of action; I think it's the fact that Momentum is now essentially you get stomped in two minutes or you stomp them in two minutes. In WaW, the games lasted longer and featured actual swings of momentum, which seems to be absent in this rendition of the game."

CodAW,3dphc9,Tenshi-01,2,Sat Jul 18 09:15:40 2015 UTC,"I'll explain. If you want to get straight to it go to the bit just above the middle if you want to read please do as it puts it into context .... and bare with me.   Your health in Hardcore is 30 and in Core it is 100.   So to get the camo challenges done you might head to hardcore (I'm not a hardcore player much) to complete the MK14 long shots and head shots etc etc. This is ok for this gun.  MK14 does damage as follows 34 at short, 33 medium and long. So it does no less than 33 damage with any variant at any range.  Job done. You can get long shots and head shots its that good. Real steady gun,until I played hardcore I hated the gun. It has its niche.   AK12 has the ""worst"" (joint) damage profile at medium along with the IMR.   It is 28 at medium range. But you don't feel it as it shoots fairly fast and is super accurate and has no real recoil compared to some of the other guns in the class. We all like an AK 12 it has a classic gun feel to it and it's always been there. No issues. So in hardcore it is a 2 shot kill at medium and long distance. Aim at the head take 2 shots, head shot. It's steady it can get you long shots. It's playable.  The issue now starts here, so....... THE IMR!   Damage is as follows - Short 35, 28 medium and 24 long. On a 4 round burst.   Don't be fooled. The range on this for short range and a shot causing 35 damage per bullet is worse than the short range on the Tac 19.   So this was my last gun to get to royalty and I needed long shots and head shots. In either core or hardcore I would run up to players who were camping (threat detection running) and go for a head shot. Easy right? Wrong! The gun would kick up and miss and they would kill me because at this stage I was set on making every kill where possible a head shot or long shot) The gun is that bad with recoil and kick. (I will add if I was close to someone I would hip fire the burst and it would kick)  At medium to long range it can be very hard to get a head shot with this. In core for a head shot you would need 3 bursts to the body and the last one the fourth to hit the head for the head shot (Or all four to hit the head) and at long range 4 shots anywhere (a burst) and then a final shot to get a long shot. By this time someone will have probably killed you with a Bal or started to jump around. In hardcore people tend to run guns with over 30 damage and you'll die in one shot. While your running around looking for someone and then you stand still long enough to line up a head shot you've been spotted and killed.  I like the gun don't get me wrong I play with an ARX so I like it as a burst gun. It's just the grind with it and having to go get those long and head shots etc etc.It can just be a hard gun given the stats to complete the challenges if it isn't your main go to gun it can confuse you a little.  I am MP and was when trying to get this done, so players in my lobby were not noobie players. Sometimes I would be chasing someone and trying to get really close for a guaranteed head shot and they would just for no apparent reason decide to turn around thus see me and my head shot opportunity had passed me by."
CodAW,3dphc9,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:22:52 2015 UTC,"If you have the Impact then it becomes a 1 burst even with a silencer. Put a Red Dot on it, Foregrip (If needed) and a silencer, and then you can 1 burst people even in normal with the IMR.   You can also reload it extremely fast, so if you have the right variants it becomes pretty good. I just prefer the HP over it so I don't use the IMR often. :)"
CodAW,3dphc9,Tenshi-01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:01:50 2015 UTC,"I love the IMR but in hardcore it's outclassed by the ARX. The higher fire rate, fast reload, and ammo regen can't make up for the extremely limited one shot kill range. In core it is a beast though. It's my main assault rifle so the camo challenges just happened as I played with it for the most part. In that respect it was actually easiest for me but I could see how trying to grind it out quickly would suck."
CodAW,3dphc9,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah but like I said, if you have the Impact then it is a 1 burst kill at all ranges even with a silencer. I think one of the elites does the same as well, but the Impact is the best variant.   That being said, like I said before I do prefer the Hole Puncher over it."
CodAW,3dphc9,its_only_pauly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Impact is always a one burst kill. However, the comment preceding yours was about how difficult it is to get longshots and headshots with the IMR and how it isn't good in HC, not how hard it is to kill someone with it. The poster even said they like the gun. I don't know what they're talking about with the recoil though, I find the IMR to have almost zero recoil.  *Edit: I just realized you may have misunderstood me when I said it had a limited one Shot kill range. I was talking about hardcore, where it takes two Shots to kill after about 17 feet/5 meters. In core the Impact and Boar Strike always kill in one Burst, or four Shots."
CodAW,3dphc9,its_only_pauly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"Well no it doesn't have recoil normally. Aim down sight and its good.   But I played hardcore and core to grind head shots. I went for hip fire when up close, as in hardcore I would find someone get close then get shot by someone else before I managed to take my shot. While hip firing I would see one bullet hit the head then I would see the rest of the burst go over the head maybe it was just me and my movement?  Now I think of it. It was probably hip spread which was the issue I used the Thunder Tusk. And it was the hip spread that made my second shot or 4th burst for example go somewhere else thus making me get frustrated.   Sometimes I would hit just below the head with the first shot and the second shot would hit the head.Then I would get the nice head shot sound! So I actually found shooting below the head when shooting from the hip helped me more.   Not kick, hip spread was to blame!"

Just don't try and die on purpose since this isn't proved to give you more supply drops, and will mostly likely just have you banned for reverse boosting."
CodAW,3dmop0,Tenshi-01,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"Unless you're a brand new player, you will get them every 45 minutes of play time, unless you have the ""Rapid Supply"" buff, which then counts for twice the time for however many minutes the buff is. For example, if your Rapid Supply is for 10 minutes, that will count as 20 minutes towards your next Supply Drop. There may be some other factors in play but this is the general consensus on how it works.  There's also a theory that you aren't necessarily guaranteed to get one after 45 minutes, it's more that the odds that you're going to get one increases after a certain amount of time. Like after 30 minutes of not getting one, you may have a 5% chance of getting one, but after 45 minutes it jumps to 25%. Generally though, you will rarely consistently get them before 45 minutes is up.  The two main things that cause them to actually drop are either a 3 kill streak or a death. There might be something else but those are the main ones."
CodAW,3dmop0,JessPlays,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Around 45 minutes and triggered by an action as most people said, usually by a death."
CodAW,3dmop0,EmotiveCDN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"As mentioned here it is trigged often by death. So the pop up appears in game.   This lead people at first to run and be the first killed in the game in the hope of getting a supply drop. There is a theory that poorer players in the game will get supply drops faster so greater than every 45 minutes.  Either way there are no magical tips. Just play the game, enjoy it and the supply drops will keep coming. At level 0,20,30 and 40 of each prestige you will get an Advanced Supply drop too."

CodAW,3dqgcq,The_Shreckoning,3,Sat Jul 18 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"RNG is nothing but random. You could one day roll a dice and it may take 10 rolls before getting a 6. However tomorrow you may try it and roll a 6 three times in a row.  Our minds always try and find a pattern, even when there isn't one. The person who rolled the dice may start to think he will always have better luck rolling dice on the same day now. When in fact it's always a 1/6 chance.  Ps4 and xbone have the same odds."
CodAW,3dqgcq,Eeveedoctor,3,Sat Jul 18 14:33:47 2015 UTC,It's not true RnG it runs on an odds system. otherwise you'd have he same odds to pull a legendary item as a enlisted. All these items seem to have 1:x odds to pull something where true RnG would make it 1x pieces of gear out. Certain items appear more and seem to pop out more often at different times because they alter these odds in the code.
CodAW,3dqgcq,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"This sounds more like it. If it's truly random then why do people get those fucking MK14s so damn often? Just seems like you've a much higher chance of getting those than say an RIP or insanity. Using enlisted as an example, then surely if you've the same chance of ANY enlisted weapon then over a long period of time then you'll accumulate a fairly even spread of enlisted weapons yet I rarely get an enlisted AK12 / ASM1 / KF5!   As someone said about rolling the dice and getting a 6 you've a one in 6 chance of getting a 6, but to roll 10 x 6 in a row then while its possible it's much less probable. that said you were to roll the same die say 6000 times then the true probabilities would come out and you'd likely have roughly an even spread between all 6 numbers.   It seems like it's weighted toward certain weapons and therefore you're much more likely to get these. And as there's a higher chance of the enlisted variant than the elite variant then it stands to reason that you'll get these enlisted ones more than the elite ones."

CodAW,3dppu6,TruthBeToldAsshole,8,Sat Jul 18 06:29:09 2015 UTC,It wasn't a tight spread it was just a slug.   And the base is awful. There are a few variants that are awesome and better than the ksg
CodAW,3dppu6,The_Shreckoning,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:31:34 2015 UTC,"Still, the tac19 would be a lot more consistent and skill based if they tightened the hipfire and ads spread by 20-30%.  The bulldog also needs to be buffed in the form of having its ammo increased to 8 and its max damahe range increased to 250.  And the S12 should have 12 ammo default not 8."

CodAW,3dppu6,The_Shreckoning,2,Sat Jul 18 09:46:15 2015 UTC,"Even if it was, the only reason it was that tight was because of steady aim pro. It's not like it was miles better."
CodAW,3dppu6,icedblackcoffee,5,Sat Jul 18 14:33:59 2015 UTC,The default spread was smaller than even the sledgehammer with laser sight.
CodAW,3dppu6,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:55:14 2015 UTC,"Right? For a pretty accurate comparison, the default spread while moving is what the TAC-19 is standing still."
CodAW,3dppu6,docmagoo2,2,Sat Jul 18 21:43:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the MW3 shotguns had a weird consistency though where you could get a longshot sometimes due to high minimum damage and at other times get annoying close range hitmarkers due to the fact that even with damage it was a 3/8 pellet kill.  The tac19 meanwhile is inconsistent not due to the damage per pellet but due to the massive spread. If SHG would just decrease the ads and hipfire spread of the tac19 by 20-30% and make laser sight 20% instead of 15%, then the gun would perform much more consistently, getting 1hks with hipfire in its 2 pellet kill range, getting an extended 1hk range when ads due to spread, and forcing players to actually be on target in order to get the kill.  People are also going to find Tuesday that the blunderbluss will suffer from the same problem with its massive maximum spread value of 20. Hopefully SHG will be smart enough to tighten to spread on the blunderbluss from 15-20 to 9-13"

CodAW,3dppu6,DPancoast,2,Sat Jul 18 10:00:19 2015 UTC,"The TAC-19 melts pretty well. It's a shotgun, so it relies on AR a lot. Until you can unlock it, stay in areas where your opponents are forced into close quarters. The indoors of Terrace and Defender come to mind. You're almost definitely using the base, which sucks wangs all the way through Dicktown, USA. Pretty much any variant of it is good, but again, use AR and you'll wreck. It also sounds like you're playing core instead of hardcore. Personal preference is fine, but it's extremely hard to get just a hitmarker and not kill in HC. Just sayin'."
CodAW,3dppu6,Loverboy_91,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:53:06 2015 UTC,"The tac-19 has good damage per pellet, but that spread makes it way too inconsistent. SHG should have tightened the hipfire and ads spread by 20-30% so that the gun was more consistent.

There are a lot, but most of them have more DLC than you, which is why you're being left out, having only the Havoc DLC. The number of non-DLC owners are too little, thus you can't get a match with any of them.  C.

I used to run with a team that would all use Goliath's....getting more than one out on the field at a time was pretty much a guaranteed win and there were times where we would get 4 or 5 out at the same time, pretty hilarious.

I use it with both rockets and the trophy system in Dom, and instead of rushing into combat with it, I try and stay some place where I will have the advantage and can predict where they will come from.

For scorestreaks use UAV with support/threat detection and either scrambler or extra time, warbird defender/system hack assist points and extra time, and Goliath with trophy and missle launcher if you want.                                                                               Run around as the Goliath just capping the flags and killing people the whole game (preferably with a homie or 2 to make capping faster and give you extra protection). You will rack up looping streaks constantly if you're doing it right and your team is helping, since danger close makes the Goliath much more consistent and saves valuable health. Rocket can help clear out enemies hiding behind cover as the Goliath mg doesn't have good bullet penetration. Warbird Defender can rack up kills for a bit if your team isn't doing much for you, but system hack makes it that much easier to get the Goliath again. You'll have the challenge done in no time"

I've already posted my long list of things they need to change so I won't post it this time, but if they balanced the base weapons better and tweaked a few of the variants then people would be more likely to come back to this game like the did with BO2."

CodAW,3dl0qm,DPancoast,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"The money isn't so much of an issue, it's the randomness. TBH the base versions should be available to everyone anyway so whether or not it should be DLC is irrelevent."

It could still be random, but when you earn a drop it could say would you like a:    gun drop gear drop support drop (care package, rapid supply, double xp, etc) mixed drop    Then you pick one and it's still random per say but if you pick the gun drop at least you are getting guns and have more chance of getting what you want."

Said ultra supply drops would only give you items you currently don't have in your armory. That way players who have a crap ton of variants have a way of being more likely to finally get that variant they kept wanting or even that piece of gear they wanted.

If the guns were added DLC and we could buy it ... then yes I would have bought 2 of them. What SHG has done is made a way that you have to spend more money in ASD and you may or may not get the item you desire, if that mechanic of the game does not sound stupid to you, then you are clearly ignorant of the fact that they are trying to milk as much money from the fan base.  So according to you fans of COD should just blindly spend more money on ASD ? even though everyone gave full price for the game + the season pass,  which is about $120.00, if you think $120.00 is not enough for a single game and they are trying to milk more money you are completely ignorant.  What will happen because of people like you   Activision will see this money making opportunity from fans Developers want to make money for Activision COD as we know it might become full of microtransactions  Imagine the possibilities -  You will have all the weaker weapons as ""unlocked"" and you have to pay for supply drops and you may or may not get the thing you desire. You want to get beyond the max prestige... well tough shit.. now you have to pay for leveling   If people like you getting them selves bend over .... because of a BS ingame  system then I pray that day dont come where COD is full of micro transactions and there is pay to win system."

Also, I've come to realize I play CoD for a different reason that other people.

Have a system in place where you can work your way up earning/unlocking the various variants.  Make it hard enough, where it will take time to gain the top tier weapons.  Just like earning Grand Master Prestige, there NEEDS to be some sense of accomplishment when you finally unlock the best of the best.  Whether this is every 2/3/4/5k kills, or going by headshots, every 100.  This gives the ability to everyone to earn their sought after weapon... Before the gang bang train comes in... obviously people playing the most/better skilled are going to earn them faster, but that applies to any game where time/skill make a difference, and this game is no different."

CodAW,3dlz45,its_only_pauly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:01:28 2015 UTC,I played to master prestige to get the obsidian steed. Before that I had to play with the Carbon.   Once I got it by default in my very next supply drop I got another Obsidian Steed! I am yet to get an inferno that is pretty much the last gun that I do not have which I would like. I had no luck and then in one week I got the AK12 RIP and Insanity too. After I hit master prestige.  So all I can say is that your unlucky if you plan to keep playing the game just wait it out. I mean I open all supply drops not expecting anything at all.   Oh I also got 6 KF5 spanners which really pissed me off. It was the only gun I would use of the multiple duplicate AMR9's and MK14's I got along the way.

Give me my Hole Puncher or Impact any day over the OS.
CodAW,3dlz45,attainableapex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:44:15 2015 UTC,"f ya. the hole puncher (impact is up there but don't like it as much) is the only one i agree with the hype. its a fing monster. most powerful gun. sucks that the silencer for me acts really weird as i would defiantly be using it. It like lags or doesn't register when the trigger is pulled after the first burst. i find it unusable. I do not use this gun without 4 streaks (even if they don't get many kills) because when i use it i know 85% of the time i will be getting all of them. along with the 45 rounds it makes it a steam train. i usually have extended mags on other guns to get 45 rounds because i play fast and ain't got time for reloading constantly and find i run up on quick successive kills a lot.  not only is the HP strong but you only really have to run a red dot on it if the irons don't suit you (me included). i would run a silencer but, what i said earlier. on the impact i find i need a red dot, and while the reload cancel is really quick i almost always need extended mags and it is a must to run a suppressor on it as there is no disadvantage. so that's 3 points more to run than the hole puncher which i can spend on streaks to really push there .... in. Ya.. i find i do really well with it.   It boggles my mind how they could put something like this in the game that is so strong as well as having good characteristics. great accuracy, great low recoil, great reload speed, and lots of ammo (HP). only downside i guess is its a burst weapon which i think is actually a good thing because noobs usually think burst weapons suck."

That being said, once they kill you the first time then they shouldn't really get you again from that spot, but if you go back make sure to check a different corner that is looking the corner or area they were sitting at previously. Since the better ones will kill you, then move slightly expecting you rush at them like a mad person.   I get that it can annoy you at times, like when I was on a 29 streak but died to somebody camping in a corner with a shotgun. I wanted to kill him so bad but decided that rushing a shot gun through a single entrance wasn't a good idea. :p   So either avoid them or go back and kill them a different way if you know where they are.

The only thing you add to the argument is that camping comes towards the end of the game's life cycle, which frankly, I don't agree with, and have no clue how you got this idea. Additionally, high score streaks reward the most skilled players, and you may be thinking ""but campers..."" but the fact of the matter is, if the camper were playing against more skilled players, they would be killed before achieving any streaks, it is only when campers are able to feast off weaker players, are they able to achieve high streaks.

CodAW,3dosmk,Johtoboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:46:04 2015 UTC,"For everyone who says ""avoid the rooms you know people are camping in"" or ""find another way in it.  Apparently you guys play against a certian kind of camper who is glued to one certain door way and Jupiters cock shoved up his ass wouldn't move the son of a bitch.    Generally I  can take care of the people who never move, that is not the issue.  The issue for me, and maybe I didn't make this clearn in my main post, is that this isn't a lone wolf camper every match.  This is the majority of a team, enough to make a difference in a match, are camped in a certain area.  You can call it clever game play for holding a spawn and I wouldn't argue with you one bit.    I'm not much of a objective player as far as DOM/HP/S&D are concerned.  I can hold my own during clan wars or when I am in a moshpit, because I understand what it takes to win those kinds of matches.  However, when a team of three people or more are specifically camping in one area of the map watching each other's back and waiting for kills.  ""Don't go through that door"" or ""don't go into that room"" isn't much of an option when the name of the game is TDM/Kill Confirmed, and the objective is simple kill the other team (and grab tags).  They don't have to move and can sit in that room, or down that alley, or on that roof for ten minutes and control the pace of the match.  That is my big issue with camping, is when teams can control a match by not moving for ten minutes."

The connection felt so consistent from player to player. No rubber banding was happening. None of the problems I been facing. It was like I was shooting bots. It took the correct amount of bullets to kill each player. It's gonna suck not having those maps but I'd rather have quality over quantity.  Edit - I also went from what is normally looking for 1/7 1/8 matches to looking for 1/47 matches. This improved my matchmaking and connection by nearly 10x and my lobby pool by 8x!!!

CodAW,3djkmj,drcubeftw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:14:41 2015 UTC,Just about anything with the single stack. I hardly ever see it in game because it's a mere enlisted gun and the breakneck looks better on paper but the exact opposite is true. Single stack is the breakneck without the massive recoil and no attachment restrictions. The damage penalty to the single stack only affects its damage at long range and you shouldn't be using an SMG to shoot at far off targets. SMGs are for close and medium range which is where most of your gun battles will be anyway.
CodAW,3djkmj,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:15:01 2015 UTC,"Also, putting rapid fire on the single stack makes the fire rate faster than the breakneck, it melts people like ice cream on a hot summer day."

CodAW,3diu51,ProtectoRofAssguarD,3,Thu Jul 16 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can ""earn"" them, but it's random and not dependent on what you do in the game. It sucks you have to pay to actually get something in the game because there is no reasonable way you can get that item by trying harder or being better. No matter how hard you try, you can only get an almost set amount of supply drops in a single prestige. Not faster or slower depending on anything you do in the game. And on top of that the game is $60. We need a way to get these things by doing really well, or completing a hard challenge. Something skillful or some objective (not the daily challenge) that will get us the supply drop not limited by a cool down of such a length of 1 day."
CodAW,3diu51,HappyGangsta,0,Thu Jul 16 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"doing really well? a difficult challenge? that sounds good but would result in it being (almost) unobtainable to a large group of players.  what they should do is simple, to every supply drop add either 0, 1 or 2 points or coins or what have you (33% for each, something you can save and with which you can buy items. green = 10, blue = 20, yellow = 30 and purple = 40? there are no purple weapons so that will still make it collectors items. and then you will get an average of 1 coin per 45 mins, you could get 1-2 nice items per week, but guaranteed, you could get some nice guns you always wanted (genuine, hole puncher, rip, obsidian steed) and then get a set of gear perhaps.  everybody could do it, it would only take some time and then you would be guaranteed to have something, unlike this system which is a lottery even when you spend 100s of  dollars/euros on supply drops."

If they implemented a system where you couldn't get doubles of an item it might be worth it for some people but that would ruin their money stream. Overall I think it really is a scam and will only get worse the more people buy.

CodAW,3diszd,shoshjort,2,Thu Jul 16 16:59:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the shit they get is better directed at Activision in the first place. Not all of it, certainly, but definitely most.  I get the distinct impression this title is being used as a test run for more microtransaction viability. Most of the people put off by it are hyped for black ops 3 anyways so it's probably less risky to do it now.  I wouldn't be too surprised if a lot of this becomes the new norm for this series."
CodAW,3diszd,streetchicken,2,Thu Jul 16 22:46:37 2015 UTC,I wonder how people will react when BO3 has some sort of micro transactions as well.  It's bound to happen.
CodAW,3diszd,backstroker1991,2,Thu Jul 16 23:47:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's bound to happen, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if it did. The safe bet is probably expecting everything except advanced supply drops, and then probably seeing something very similar to them in Ghosts 2.  That said the cosmetic items in purchasable, randomized packs might be here to stay.  After all, black ops 2 was the first call of duty with DLC camo packs. Obviously we're not counting special edition stuff from previous titles as such, and I wouldn't put MW3's Elite / Founder stuff in the same category either.  In any case it's pretty clear they've been trying to monetize extra content for a while now. I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with that but there are definitely good and bad ways to go about that."
CodAW,3diszd,streetchicken,2,Fri Jul 17 00:16:40 2015 UTC,"You worded it well. I don't expect anything like advanced supply drops either. But seeing how profitable they were in AW, I could see Activision finding some creative way to add purchasable content."
CodAW,3diszd,backstroker1991,2,Fri Jul 17 00:44:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly it seems like most of the flak from the supply drops pertain primarily to weapons.  Stripping the variant system but leaving the purchasable packs with customization content is probably on the table if not in development.  You wouldn't even have to have the random drop supplies for that to be implemented, though from a purely theoretical standpoint I'm fine with... something.  Bit of a tangent here, but if we were to broom the underwhelming reinforcement care packages and just have supply drops with customization content and double XP and maybe a more sensible system for the drops and rapid supply in general, and then if you want you can just buy the drops directly (with the same chance at the same gear) I'd be theoretically okay with it.  Maybe have it be based on something like ""x number of match reward bonuses = supply crate"" or... something. At first glance I can see that working great for keeping people from quitting but at the same time I can also see tons of people just quitting in and out of matches to get in on one that's almost over just for the free supply drop.  For me personally the two main issues I have are the ASD exclusive content and the inability to really aim for specific things. Level the playing field and if someone wants to drop a bunch of money for more chances at whatever, that's on them.  On the other hand what I'd really prefer to see is a system where absolutely everything can be targeted for player unlock and then if you just don't want to deal with that you can buy it."
CodAW,3diszd,streetchicken,2,Fri Jul 17 01:18:43 2015 UTC,"Your last paragraph is especially spot on. If supply drops had simply accelerated the obtaining of gear of weapons that COULD BE OBTAINED DIRECTLY OTHERWISE, I'm sure there would be a whole lot let less noise about them."

CodAW,3diszd,FavoriteApe,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:10 2015 UTC,Being I was avid on gta I know for a fact Rockstar gave no fair warning that gta was going to become a next gen game though it was planned all the whole time. Only 2 months prior to its new gen release did they inform the community when it became time to advertise it. They've been one of the most secretive game developers as to what their future plans are.
CodAW,3diszd,ACiDRiFT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:26:10 2015 UTC,they most certainly did not have all of the additional content planned in october.  there would be know way of them knowing they would hit that limit until they actually hit it
CodAW,3diszd,its_only_pauly,2,Thu Jul 16 18:32:04 2015 UTC,Then how is DLC4 going to work on last gen if this wasn't planned out this far ?
CodAW,3diszd,its_only_pauly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"LOL.  map packs are a different story.  other additional items are not.  and it sounds like it's a cache memory type limit.  the hard drive can hold as many maps as you have space, but the memory devoted to the game has a limit of how much data can be loaded at once, which is why weapons present an issue. since anyone can pick up weapons from downed foes, all weapons have to be loaded in at all times, and creates that problem.  They could probably add the weapons in, but that could cause them not to be able to provide all that they have planned for DLC4 for last gen, which would be much more problematic because of season pass sales obvioiusly.  the bottom line is that it is ludicrous to think that all the features and bells and whistles of a game designed for current tech would be able to support all the same features on decade old systmes.  It is even more ludicrous to think that sledgehammer are lying about it just to spite last gen owners of the game which is what /u/its_only_pauly seems to think"
CodAW,3diszd,its_only_pauly,3,Thu Jul 16 20:20:58 2015 UTC,I've said to you that the games are two very different games on the respective new and last gen consoles. There is no comparison.  No one expects the same game with all the features and we do not get the same game. Sledge hammer will not officially come out and say it is not cost effective for us to bring all this content to last gen so we will not do it. We do not live in a world where sledge hammer will do that. I don't think their choices are to spite anyone. Its a simple business decision.   You seem to have gone on a personal crusade against me. You are free to do what you want. From what I can see you seem really happy you have a next gen console and look down on people using last gen. Props to you my friend.

This explanation has been quoted over and over all over the place. I even posted it here myself the other day and said it was bullshit.   They simply do not want to spend money making changes to the game at this late stage for last gen. I do not think these guns were originally going to be released as they have been.  Lets just say memory limit and hope people are that stupid that they believe it. Stop believing it. Look at how a computer works before you think the memory limit is going to hold back the game by adding a few guns.   As I think I said before here I have AW on both gens and the games are not the same not even close to say hardware limits are stopping them adding guns is laughable.The PS3 does not have ground breaking graphics running it looks worse than ghosts did on the ps3.   And you yourself seemed to agree.... you posted this not so long ago on another thread which I was in when someone suggested that the guns could be put into the game.  ""Yeah.

In ghosts it made sense since it was the post apocalyptic future where fuel was expensive and ammunition a rarity(I mean ammo was a killstreak FFS). But only 1 viable launcher to take out aircraft in 2056? Cmon. I used to destroy UAVs and stealth choppers by the dozen in BO2 thanks to the two launchers and the Black hat, they need to make launchers viable again. MAAWS is a joke if you want to take out a UAV or a paladin, it should have acted like a SMAW or let you lock on to aircraft like in ghosts. It wouldn't kill them to make a hacker/black hat variant either, I made a suggestion on my AW attachments idea topic that you could put a black hat on your gun as a attachment and it would take the same spot as the laser or parabolic microphone.

CodAW,3dj3n7,Frogman360,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"Purchased DLC 1 and 2. 2 sets of the extra armory slots. Dropped 10$ on ASD when I found out about them. Got nothing interesting and said never again. I'll purchase DLC 3 and 4 when they rotate into regular playlists. So at the end of the day they grabbed me for 134$ after I get the last DLC. Either ways it's cheaper to me to play the game considering the amount of time per dollar than any other kind of lifestyle habits I've had. Go to the casino w the wife for a night and come home empty handed, at that rate u could buy all that stuff and a Xbox one."

Also spent $ on Nanotech personalization packs, Tiki camo, Champion camo and that colorful camo (not for me tho...my little boy want it lol)...haven't spent money on ASD or the extra amory slots yet and probably will not since I still got a long way to go before I hit Grand Master Prestige."
CodAW,3dj3n7,exoticstructures,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:49:28 2015 UTC,"I pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe version so I voted for the season pass option but I didn't pay the full $50. Aside from that, I haven't purchased anything from the store. I've been tempted to get the extra class slots but I don't like how they're just a big list of classes instead of being divided into sets of 10. The only reason I'd get them is so that I could keep a set for challenges I'm working on and sets for different modes. Having to scroll through a bunch just to get to a certain chunk of classes sounds like more trouble than it's worth, at least until I hit GMP and don't have to worry about my classes resetting."
CodAW,3dj3n7,EmotiveCDN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah the day I hit GMP I decided to purchase the extra CaC slots.

He does a* ""CoD in Depth"" series where he goes in depth to tell everyone the inner-workings of the game and how perks are used or what stats guns have. Not only that, but he does random commentaries from time to time about random topics with CoD gameplay in the background. All in all, he's a VERY good youtuber who takes his job seriously."

The 870 was good, but no better than smgs Thunder loved using), and hates the idea of secondaries being anything above trash (when people found out that the secondaries of BO3 were going to be decent his response is to think they are going to be OP).

CodAW,3dfqll,NeonPhyzics,2,Thu Jul 16 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"That's comparing apples to oranges though, because in those instances you're looking for specific elite variants which already have almost miniscule drop rates.  A better comparison would be to consider how many enlisted or pro variants of the BAL, ASM1, or HBR you've gotten in drops.  I don't have the Insanity, Inferno, or Speakeasy either, but the enlisted and pro variants of those guns certainly aren't that rare.  Frankly, I don't see the point in locking the base weapon behind supply drops for any reason other than trying to drive up ASD sales, but I'm not losing sleep over it."

CodAW,3dii4d,ozarkslam21,2,Thu Jul 16 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"I have royalty pistols so that will be my main focus. Do no perks/attachments first. When you are finished with that, you will have a good feeling for the weapons strengths and weaknesses. After that, put low profile and blast suppressor on every class. Point blanks and headshots require you to be up close and personal so staying off the radar is important. Akimbo is probably the best attachment for Atlas .45, Grach, and PDW. Grind for the akimbo attachment while doing no perks/attachments so you can hit the ground running. Akimbo makes these guns melt up close. Use UAV with threat detection to look for AFKers. This is great for getting a point blank and a headshot with one kill. Flank your heart out and it will go by quickly. I finished all pistols pre-nerf with less than 200 kills on each one."
CodAW,3dii4d,tuname1t,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:49:39 2015 UTC,"You need to do both the IMR and MK14. Do the IMR first if you play core. It's not that bad a gun depending on the variant used.   The MK14 you have to do in hardcore. It's a one shot kill and actually not bad once you've done no perks and no attachments. I used the eclipse and kinda enjoyed it after a while.   After that do whatever your comfy with next. I did assault rifles then snipers and now have the AMR9 left for SMGs.   Always start with no perks no attachments. I have a class made up for it and just switch the gun once completed. For a lot of camo challenges like dogfights, slide kills etc I play hardcore domination. No respawn timer and much less camping than tdm.   Most of all have fun with it.   Hope that helps."

CodAW,3dhbr3,s0meMurk,3,Thu Jul 16 11:50:32 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those people. the S12 Whirlwind shows up as my favorite weapon in stats. I also happily use snipe, insanity/impact, or SMGs on maps where they make more sense!  On more than half of the maps, there are high-traffic, tight hallways/closed quarters routes where shotguns can dominate over ARs and SMGs.   Think Detroit and Urban, for example. Most of the areas on those maps are in hipfire range for an s12- it will kill faster than an AR can get ready. Bulldog is nearly as good, but the reload time and smaller mag sizes let the s12 win out. The tac19 is arguably better against other shotguns, but you need a really good connection to run with it.  That particular variant/whirlwind is my favorite over all the others.  It carries plenty of ammo, and is fast but not so fast as to be useless. I can usually manage a double kill blind, or a triple if I creep up behind the enemies.  It needs gung-ho and scavenger too, or you'll not rack up the kills as fast"

CodAW,3dhbr3,docmagoo2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:58:43 2015 UTC,"Honesty not as good as some other weapons like the insanity. However after a recent post asking what the best shotgun was (for marksman challenge)  I started using the s12 whirlwind. It's honestly one of the most fun to use weapons, and I'm having a blast. Also with advance rifle, mags, and laser, it's Imo the best close range weapon."
CodAW,3dhbr3,Eeveedoctor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:52:39 2015 UTC,"My question is, how the fuck does ADS help the accuracy of a shotgun?"
CodAW,3dhbr3,Stayfaded55,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:20:53 2015 UTC,"While ADS the spread is always the same as standing still and hipfiring. As soon as you start moving your hipfire spread increases, while ADS and moving it stays the same. It increases the most with the Bulldog, then the S12, with the Tac-19 having the smallest increase. So if you're trying to rush hard, or enter a contested area, it can be beneficial to ADS so more pellets hit your target. I like to use stock with the S12 for this reason, it really extends the usable range. Sometimes it's better to hipfire like crazy to clear a room, the extra spread means you can hit more targets at once. With the Tac-19 I literally never ADS.  An interesting quirk of the shotgun ADS mechanics is that while crouched or prone you have a smaller spread while hipfiring than you do while ADS."
CodAW,3dhbr3,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:38:59 2015 UTC,"He means, how can the position of the gun, relative to your body, affect the spread of a shotgun she'll when fired. It's done for balancing, but obviously it doesn't really make sense at all."
CodAW,3dhbr3,mastersoup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"I thought that was obvious, it's a video game after all. So many things in the game don't make sense, you can't really single out one mechanic. If games were 100% realistic they'd be boring and there would be no reason to play them.  *Edit: Although to answer the question, in real life if you are holding a shotgun up to your face to aim down sights you will be more accurate and move more slowly than if you are hipfiring. It doesn't make the actual spread of the pellets tighter, but the area you are aiming at is smaller. You can have an extremely tight spread but if your gun is waving all over the place you won't be accurate. Accuracy with shotguns in real life is dependent not only on pellet spread but also the area your gun is currently pointed. So the gameplay mechanics are at least somewhat based in reality."
CodAW,3dhbr3,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:25:53 2015 UTC,I use my whirlwind way more than my insanity. I actually dont really even use my insanity. The whirlwind is the best close range weapon in the game imo so if I'm playing kill confirmed or any close range map thats my goto gun.

CodAW,3dhbr3,PuddingAuxRais1ns,2,Thu Jul 16 08:38:02 2015 UTC,"I tried each of these & prefer the whirlwind.  The tiger blood empties the mag too fast. I don't seem to win any more 1v1, but I lose more 1v2 or 1v3 during reloading.  Compliant is my second choice behind whirlwind. the rapid fire really helps.   Quiet time is really good for hardcore or S&D rounds  I run whirlwind with x mags, laser, and rifling.. will ADS for ranged kills or hipfire for most surprise/rush situations"
CodAW,3dhbr3,MajorWahoobies,2,Thu Jul 16 10:36:34 2015 UTC,"That's what really makes the whirlwind better Imo is the better mag, add that with extended mag, you get 15 shots a mag. Making its better for 1v2 or 3 like you mentioned"

CodAW,3dkb5c,EmotiveCDN,0,Fri Jul 17 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, but at the same time, there should be some better balance so that people don't feel forced to use the asm1 and bal27 in order to keep up with others.  Basically, they need to nerf the asm1 (a real nerf, like adding some recoil) and nerf the bal some more (maybe add a little more recoil) and the insanity (by adding a -1 accuracy variation to it). I'm certain that if the bal27, asm1, and insanity got nerfed tomorrow that it would lead to a spike in weapon diversity."

As does the insanity (I would say the insanity is the only weapon variant so OP compared to its base that they specifically have to nerf the variant).  Asm1 shouldn't be able to melt people at mid range so easily and shouldn't stand a chance at long range like it does. It needs a bunch of recoil added.  Bal is too accurate for the damage that it does. It needs some recoil added. The recoil would especially balance the obsidian steed.

The rest are mid tier or mid-high tier, but not top tier like the speakeasy, obsidian steed, inferno, and rigor.  And I can't help but laugh at the idea that the base ae4 is equal or better than the asm1 and bal. No it's not. It's got a very slow fire rate and its ads spread makes it useless at long range. It would be great if they removed the ads spread, changed the damage to 34-33-28, and added a 1.1 chest and neck multi, but SHG isn't going to do something that would better balance it for both core and hardcore."
CodAW,3dkb5c,JediMindTrxcks,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:46:01 2015 UTC,"The Insanity and Hole Puncher are really the only two of that list that are in the same league as the Bal or ASM1. Firstly, across the board, the Bal and ASM1 have more than one or two useful or good variants. The Bal has the Steed, Inferno, Carbon, and Tactical, while the ASM1 has the Rigor, Magnitude, Speakeasy, and Competence. Both Royalty variants are also excellent, but they are also respectively copies of the Steed and Speakeasy, so I won't count those.   Secondly, those weapons you listed are either situational or require very specific setups to do well. In general, using the Bal and the ASM1 are going to give you as good results in every scenario as the Ameli variants or KF5 ones."

CodAW,3dkb5c,UhBigDeizel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:57 2015 UTC,"Weapon balance/variety is a big issue. This game does have poor weapon balance, arguably the worst of all the CoD games though it is partially due to the mobility the exo suit provides. With your targets moving around so much you're going to be pushed to SMGs or assault rifles for the versatility and range. More specialized weapons like shotguns and sniper rifles become harder to use. CoD4 or Black Ops 2 are examples of weapon balancing done right.  However, I still believe the biggest problem is the exo suit itself and the enhanced player mobility. Ultimately, giving players the ability to move around the map so quickly serves to make the gameplay random and that is not a good thing. Faster is not better."

CodAW,3diegv,pedroef,9,Thu Jul 16 14:58:19 2015 UTC,"This post reeks of reddit's classic consumer entitlement.  ""Everything X is doing is wrong, but the tides are turning and they know it so I recommend they do something that I want so that we won't be mad anymore!""  It's flawed logic. In particular, ""almost every decision creates discontent in the player base."" is not true. What do you mean by this? It might create discontent on Reddit, but that does not mean anything. Yesterday this subreddit was literally upset because they patched in three free guns. People found something to complain about with that.    They are sacrificing their long term success (AW2?), at a cost of quick flux of money.   I don't believe this for a second, either. Reason one: Sure, they are making some of us (on the subreddit) upset. Even if every one of us boycotted AW2, it wouldn't even show up as a blip on the radar. The overwhelming majority of CoD players are content.   Reason two: Call of Duty is dying. Every game sells less than the last and the series is slowly wearing on people. People are getting bored of CoD and it's time will soon be passed. So in this respect, maybe ""going for the cash now"" instead of planting a seed for the future is indeed the correct move. You don't know. But I'm going to assume Activision/Sledgehammer does.   My idea was to reduce the time between supply drops to half, I think this a great thing to implement and almost has no bad side for them (less ASDs revenue).    Here's my opinion:  This is crazy. It might happen when AW's time is up (like the permanent Strikezone playlist in Ghosts, just a little something for the dedicated fans sticking around), but it is a downright stupid move right now. You say it has ""no bad side"", but you go on to mention the lessened ASD revenue. That is the downside.   If they reduce the amount of time between supply drops by a half, they are effectively doubling the amount of loot they put out there. Doubling it. So everyone would have (in theory) twice as many variants unlocked as they already do. That's less incentive to buy ASDs. People would be getting them twice as fast, which would be even less incentive to buy ASDs (as they can act as a ""pay to fast forward"" button for those willing to pay money instead of waiting for another drop).  This game is fine, and the developers aren't ""making the wrong decisions"" or ""ruining the game"" any more than any CoD developer/game has in the past. In fact, I'd say that Sledgehammer is being pretty darn good to us.   FOUR free guns. Four. That you don't have to pay a cent for! You don't have to have the Season Pass, you don't have to have a DLC, nothing! Just play and eventually you'll unlock them. That kind of support is unheard of from a CoD developer. The only free shit I can remember getting in a CoD game is the Christmas camo in Ghosts and the Terminal map in MW3.   Anyway, I'm done ranting. It just feels like this subreddit is constantly angry and ungrateful and will never be happy no matter what Sledgehammer does."

Example: ""Oh my granda just broke his leg and has luccemia but i will do nothing because is going to die"" That's not what you would say or any Activision employee, you will try to cure him.  As for other points, I'd like to see them making something truly nice (like the Irons) and not just giving us an half full cup: ""Hey guys we releasing new weapons but to unlock them you have to get one variant out of hundreds of loot, you may not get one opening 50 SD's but don't worry just do how Chaos does and buy a shit ton of ASDs to get them; no need to thanks here in SHG we like to give"".  EDIT: grammar issues"
CodAW,3diegv,fe-and-wine,3,Thu Jul 16 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"Youtube which is a representation of most of our comunity.   No. Youtube comments do not represent the whole of the Call of Duty fanbase. I can't believe I'd even have to state this.    If you think that those people are buying AW2 than you are definitly wrong.   Could've said the same thing about that Steam MW2 Boycott group a few years back. And the day it came out they were all playing away. People love to complain - especially on the internet.   And for every people that coment there are 50 who does not (people like me).   I don't think you understand how this works. Have you ever heard of a ""vocal minority""? Basically, the people who comment on YouTube videos hating on the game (or even praising it) are a vocal minority, meaning they are a small group of people who speak very loudly (often behind the mask of the internet) about something. Usually negatively. The VAST majority of CoD players really don't care. The game's fine. Not the best, not the worst, not terrible, not great, just...fine.    Well but we'll see three years from now who is right when the sales of AW2 will be the lowest of franchise.   Maybe. If it's the last of the franchise. The bottom line is that (with one or two exceptions for superbly hyped up/established series) CoD sales are declining because people are getting tired of it. If you go look at the sales figures for every CoD since Modern Warfare, you'll see they steadily increased right up until MW3, at which point they peaked. Every year since then, the sales have been a little less than the year before. There have just been so many CoDs that people are growing weary of the franchise, and sales are dropping. It happens. It's natural. Look at Guitar Hero, or Tony Hawk.    Just to accept that the franchise is dying and not to try to do something about it is just stupid.   Not exactly sure what you mean here. The franchise is dying because there have been so many games. People are just getting tired of it. There's a new one literally every year. People are just getting bored with Call of Duty in general, and the only thing Activision can ""do about it"" is to make less Call of Duty games. Which won't happen. Again, see: Guitar Hero/Tony Hawk.   Example: ""Oh my granda just broke his leg and has luccemia but i will do nothing because is going to die"" That's not what you would say or any Activision employee, you will try to cure him.   Not even going to touch this. This is absolute gibberish/nonsense. Just refer to the rest of this post and pretend I was responding to whatever the hell you were trying to say here.   As for other points, I'd like to see them making something truly nice (like the Irons) and not just giving us an half full cup:   So the defining factor for a ""nice"" piece of content is whether or not you have to unlock it? The fuck? Get over yourself.  How about all that cool/crazy armor in the game? Is that content garbage because you have to get it from a drop?   Hey guys we releasing new weapons but to unlock them you have to get one variant out of hundreds of loot   What, you mean like the Speakeasy? The Obsidian Steed?  Consider the Steed. It's one variant. And it's Elite. The chances of getting a Steed, even across 100 Supply Drops, is very low.   Now let's look at the STG. I think there are ten variants, of varying rarity. So that's at least ten times more common than the Steed. Moreso because some of the STG's variants are Enlisted/Professional.   I get that it sucks to have to rely on RNG to access the new guns, but let's not go overboard and compare that to, oh, I dunno, an old man with Leukemia, for example. Because that'd be silly.  The bottom line here is that when the guns get released, you'll probably have them both within the month, if not the week. Sure, there will be people who just get fucked by RNG and open hundreds upon hundreds of Drops without getting the guns, but that's the nature of things. It's not the end of the world, and, by definition it'll only effect a very small percentage of people.   So, to summarize, you are wrong. By DEFINITION, only a very small number of people will get fucked by RNG and not get the new guns. And because of this, it's not a big deal, because it doesn't effect a lot of people.   comunity  definitly  granda  luccemia  and for every people that coment here  EDIT: grammar issues   ayy lmao  tl;dr: I'm an asshole, but you're wrong. The end."

With the AE4 and Ohm, they were included in regular DLC packs, or you can buy the Ohm separately on Xbox now. So, either $14.99 or $3.99 for a gun and its 10 variants.  The M1 Irons is free, so yeah, that was a totally good thing. A good gun and its 10 variants all for free.  But if you think that Activision was gonna let SHG put out more free shit like this, then you're really naive, my friend. Remember, Activision was the one that wanted to monetize supply drops (even though SHG didn't want to). They're the one that came up with the money-making scheme here. So they had to put in a catch for the new guns, so it's still technically free, but players will have to either grind for it, or gamble with the Advanced Supply Drops."

I paid for my season pass. 2/3 guns you have to pay for, so I've already paid for my new DLC guns thank you. The M1 irons was the first DLC gun in the COD franchise to be completely free IIRC. So explain to me how a season pass owner getting access to a new base gun qualifies as free shit. I'm not asking for that. You said this was the best Activision could do. Based on their past actions that's clearly bullshit."
CodAW,3dd7z1,ozarkslam21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:19:59 2015 UTC,"I said this was the best Sledgehammer could do. That was the best they could do to give players free guns, while making it not completely free to please Activision. Not everyone enjoys it, but there's not a lot of other options available.  If they include the new guns in the last DLC pack, then that's basically cutting out a lot of season pass content that was promised for the X360 and PS3, since they have probably gone over their memory limit. The M1 Irons freezing issue should be a sign already.  If they release the guns separately and charge $3.99 each, people'd complain about it regardless, because let's face it, $3.99 per gun is expensive as hell.  The only option is to give it out for free, but then Activision wouldn't like it. No gaming corporation would want too much free DLC.  The ""season pass owners get base gun"" deal may seem like a good thing, but only if there weren't the X360 and PS3 versions. Because then the last gen guys will feel ripped off.

CodAW,3dd7z1,MeGustaTortugas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"from a business perspective, although unpopular apparently, your statements are very true.  I think a fair compromise though would have been for one to be free-free and the other 2 to be available in SD's. I mean with the frequency that someone like myself plays, (and i feel like i play at least an average to slightly below average amount) i still haven't gotten an obsidian steed, inferno, RIP, insanity, speakeasy, etc.  And thats with like 7.5 days play time.  so if in 180 hours of playing i haven't gotten those particular 5 items, the likelihood of getting any 3 specific weapon drops  is pretty low for me considering theres only 3.5 months left of me playing the game"

I'd rather have a chance at something as opposed to there being 0 chance like there would've been in past CODs. I don't need anything in supply drops so this actually makes me want to play.

Now unless you go and pay more than 120$ you won't get the full sets on Advanced Warfare (carnevale and all those) unless you are very very lucky.  Im still getting 1 shotted by the extremely weak SN6s by the way... with over 50Mbs on the ps4 conection test. They could use the massive fortune they earned with advanced supply drops on that.
CodAW,3dd7z1,icedblackcoffee,2,Wed Jul 15 11:47:43 2015 UTC,"50Mbs on the ps4 conection test.   Upload and Download have very little to do with your actual connection in multiplayer, look at anyone who's looked at the data transmitted when playing, it's minimal compared to a lot of other activities. If you have QOS on your Router looking into prioritizing your PS4's connection and traffic. It's also possible your ISP is buried and you're getting a junk ping as well."
CodAW,3dd7z1,ozarkslam21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:50:35 2015 UTC,"How can I test my ping on PS4?  On my computer I get 27Ms ping wireless, so I suppose is slightly better on my PS4 since its wired, but how can I test it?   Is it good enough or is 27 MS ping bad? If its bad is there any way for me to lower ping on router configuration?"
CodAW,3dd7z1,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"27ms is good, but you need to know where the dedicated servers are for AW (yes there are some!) and find your ping to them, the other issue is the ping you get to the other player if you're connecting P2P.  It's not a perfect science but using QOS on a router is honestly the best solution as you can tell it to prioritize your connection on PS4 to AW. If someone fires up Netflix, you can give them a 480i connection while you play because you can give the bandwidth to your PS4, not their Netflix connection."

There is no ""range"" game in SC (outside of snipers I guess) - and HC opens up a large amount of cool playstyles/strategies that are simply too far behind in SC to be useful.

CodAW,3dga46,icedblackcoffee,2,Thu Jul 16 05:47:22 2015 UTC,Oh I agree. It sucks ass. The guns should be balanced.
CodAW,3dga46,maniacalxmatt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:32:12 2015 UTC,At this point it's too little too late. It's already July and the gun has had one buff that actually made it worse than before.
CodAW,3dga46,icedblackcoffee,2,Thu Jul 16 01:34:39 2015 UTC,It's not too late. If they actually balanced the game well enough then people would still be playing it for longer than a year. Look at how many people play black ops 2 for more than a year.
CodAW,3dga46,maniacalxmatt,2,Thu Jul 16 15:45:45 2015 UTC,That's because blops2 was made by a competent developer who actually made fixes to their game. SHG ignores certain wall breaches for months on end while adding new cosmetic shit to grab some extra cash.
CodAW,3dga46,42z3ro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:13 2015 UTC,"But the main point is that it's because treyarch almost perfectly balanced their weapons. There wasn't one or two OP guns that everyone used. Even in search and destroy you saw huge variety. People used nearly every AR except the SWAT, every SMG, all the LMGs except the QBB, both pump action shotguns, both bolt action snipers, and even the b23r and kap were all used in S&D."
CodAW,3dga46,maxhatcher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:08 2015 UTC,I agree with what you're saying. And it just reinforces my point that Treyarch is king and SHG is incompetent.
CodAW,3dga46,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:20 2015 UTC,I had no problem getting diamond on the mk14 and I did it all in core before they buffed it. Theres no reason why it shouldn't be easy to do in hardcore especially now after the buff. Getting longshots with the bal was by far the biggest pain in the ass for me doing AR mastery.
CodAW,3dga46,TheGoggs,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"OMG. Yes. Had everything but longshots with BAL and since I had both Inferno and OS figured, ""How hard can this be?"" I almost gave up a few times. MK14, although total @ss, was surprisingly easier. I actually pull this out on site244 and Sideshow, occasionally."
CodAW,3dga46,akapixelrat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:19:39 2015 UTC,Yeah for whatever reason the bal just doesn't deliver the way any of the other rifles do at really long ranges. they should've just made this gun a smg.  I know from the bathrooms to the hotel roof on sideshow with the Bal just didn't feel like it was doing anything. Any other ar will melt at that range
CodAW,3dga46,XboxWigger,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"As did I....The ARX, for me....was relatively easy. The MK, on the other hand,...was not."
CodAW,3dga46,tyzenberg,3,Thu Jul 16 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"the game was so glitchy when it first came out it just randomly gave me royalty for my AR's didn't bother doing the challenges after that.  The challenges are weak in this game, I wish they would have been better thought out.  They aren't fun."
CodAW,3dga46,_swamp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:05:37 2015 UTC,They are a ripoff of Black Ops 2 ones which is why I don't like them.  So much of this game is a ripoff of Black Ops 2 in the challenge and medal system.
CodAW,3dga46,hangul_,4,Thu Jul 16 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"There was a time that the MK14 did 48 damage up close with a 1.1x chest modifier and the Eagle Eye, in the right hands, had a faster TTK than the ASM1.  However, the cries of the community were meet with an MK14 buff that actually turned it into a pile of poop."
CodAW,3dga46,XboxWigger,2,Thu Jul 16 01:33:25 2015 UTC,"The ARX will be a breeze if you get the Steel Bite or, preferably, the Hole Puncher. The Hole Puncher is one of the best ARs in the game.   The MK14 is challenging but, if you've got quick accuracy and a moderator fast finger, it's actually fun to use and can do some damage. You just have to kill the person before they manage to jump away because then you're pretty much screwed. I always send 4 or 5 bullets down streams just to be sure I do enough damage. I was always fast to complain about it but, after I spent a bunch of time with the EPM3 and its ridiculous muzzle flash, I went back to the MK14 and had some great matches with it. Now I love it."
CodAW,3dga46,evils_twin,2,Thu Jul 16 03:02:28 2015 UTC,"I played hardcore kill confirmed to finish up the MK14 and found that I'd only need one shot out to a fairly long distance. HCKC isn't as campy as the other HC modes, you may even have fun. I did and I am usually a Core TDM guy."
CodAW,3dga46,Not_Pikachu_,2,Thu Jul 16 12:29:51 2015 UTC,hardcore kill confirmed is the easiest way to unlock the camo challenges but yes the guns are terrible in this game.
CodAW,3dga46,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Thu Jul 16 14:27:15 2015 UTC,"I think they added the MK14 so that getting Royalty Camo for ARs is an actual challenge . . .  There seems to be at least one really challenging weapon in each weapon class.  Not every weapon has to be as good as the next, adding challenging weapons to use is part of this game."
CodAW,3dga46,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Thu Jul 16 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"Try infected. The mk14 is in rotation, and you can grind out the headshots and longshots there"
CodAW,3dga46,flushablewipes,2,Thu Jul 16 18:16:15 2015 UTC,I didn't have a lot of problems with the arx or the mk14. U just gotta play ur role. Keep your distance and stay out of short lines of site where asm1s or similar weapons can knock you down. I actually keep a arx class set up I use on certain maps. It's a great gun. Mk14 could be a little more powerful but u just gotta play smart with it
CodAW,3dga46,cyph3x,2,Thu Jul 16 18:49:09 2015 UTC,I'll say this also. You missed a big window of opportunity to do ARs. When you could play havoc DLC as a solo playlist. Sideshow  and urban almost back to back to back. Sideshow best longshot map and urban has a long ledge  that stretches the map that yields tons of longshots. Most ppl were doing the same so I'd always have someone to challenge at the other side of the ledge.
CodAW,3dga46,flushablewipes,4,Thu Jul 16 18:53:17 2015 UTC,I really wanted to like the MK14 and SN6 but I gave up on those guns and also gave the game away.

I can get 61 kills with it if i play smart, but when i play smart with an ASM1 i get 75 kills. There's a reason why you don't see any of the pros use any other SMG, you only see the ASM1."

CodAW,3dclvq,TheGoggs,-4,Wed Jul 15 14:37:18 2015 UTC,That seems more like a personal issue than a game one. The ability to unlock them via Supply Drops is there. I don't think Sledgehammer can be held responsible for the circumstances that prevent you playing for more than an hour per week.

CodAW,3dclvq,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"This is not meant as a negative comment towards you, but it's that behavior -- buying ASDs to get loot -- that encourages them to do this.  They see, ""hey, ASD purchases are slowing down.  How do we fix this to keep revenue up?"" and the answer they come up with is, ""Put new stuff in, so those people who buy ASDs will buy more now!""  I realize that people sitting at GMP can only get ASDs by buying them (except on PC, because nobody on PC can buy any ASDs), but they're counting on people shelling out money for in-game loot.  When the money slows down, they add more loot.  It's a proven business model."

CodAW,3dclvq,6_1_5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:59:25 2015 UTC,I like the idea better of them being available only in supply drops. At least i dont have to buy a season pass or a dlc pack to get them and every other person wont be running around with them as soon as they're released.

They didn't just ""not think about it"". This is a business decision.  No one is expecting/asking Sledgehammer to make all the new aesthetic gear sets free, are they? Why not? Because we understand those are to make money and if they just gave them away it would defeat the purpose (to sell Advanced Supply Drops). Same deal here.  The guns have to be found in Supply Drops first because they are trying to sell ASDs. They're hoping some of the lazier folk will just drop $25 on ASDs to get the new guns.  To everyone saying ""We need to tweet Condrey and get the word out!"", you're being silly. To think that Sledgehammer ""doesn't realize"" we would rather just have the guns is honestly a bit naive.   To everyone saying ""Sledgehammer doesn't give a shit about its fans"" or whatever: Just stop. This is not about Sledgehammer caring about their fans or not.  They just patched in not one or two but three new guns for us. They aren't requiring the Season Pass, they aren't requiring we buy DLC4, this is a pretty sweet deal. I get that relying on RNG to try out the new weapons kinda sucks, but it's still a really cool thing of Sledgehammer to do and you guys are acting like ungrateful children about it."
CodAW,3dclvq,6_1_5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"Well I do see a problem here because you have to gamble to get it. I understand gambling for variants but if you are a loyal player who plays 4 hours everyday and competed every challenge the game has to offer, you can still never have a chance of getting these guns based on luck. It just shows they're sponging the game by trying to lure in casual players who will jump on open one supply drop or spend 10$, not get a gun and go back to battlefield or destiny or whatever game, rather than worry about pleasing their devoted fanbase. I'm not trying to argue with you, but I think it's kind of selfish and greedy of them to not offer the base variants ofr have a civil way for regulars to unlock the base variant by even say a challenge (2000 shotgun kills unlocks blunderbuss, 2000 ar kills unlocks svo) I'm not ungrateful or even care if I ever get one of these guns because I'll just use whatever I have but for people who look forward to them I can understand why they aren't happy. If you could purchase them for 5$ each then I'd say okay not terrible but they want more time and money (how many asds are people willing to buy to get one is their thought process) than it's worth."

CodAW,3dfdx4,its_only_pauly,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:50:16 2015 UTC,Original poster ignore the comments at the top they don't explain anything. The post here by 6_1_5 gets to the point.   Hardware limitations is just a con. This is the reason as mentioned through this thread the fact is it was easier to not port the guns and put more money in and effort. The M1 irons did not make last gen bug or bug the fuck out.   I don't think from the off Sledge hammer decided to add these guns in this manner in which they have now. It was probably a public relations move and a chance to make some more money and an incentive to keep people playing that bit longer.   Why the down votes for this guys post I don't know. If you look at last gen and new gen I have both the game is so scaled back that adding a few guns would not be an issue.   Until a developer explains this to you don't presume a hardware limit has been reached.

CodAW,3df7rl,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Wed Jul 15 20:19:02 2015 UTC,well I guess I should of said is there like a certain gun thats better for headshots and would core/hc be better
CodAW,3df7rl,TheRealTofuey,2,Wed Jul 15 20:27:10 2015 UTC,If you are accurate hardcore is the way to go. Long range maps were pepole tend to camp is also nice because you can sneak up behind them and pick off some easy headshots.
CodAW,3df7rl,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:36:41 2015 UTC,Maybe one with more recoil. Ameli might be a good choice. I think core is better for headshots as less bullets to kill means less chance of the recoil kickin for the HS.
CodAW,3df7rl,ozarkslam21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"nooooo it is 100 times easier in HC, because a headshot is almost always going to be OHK in hc with heavy weapons.  if he is any good at all he will be able to get far more skill headshots with one shot then hoping for a recoil bounce headshot in core.  that is not good advice lol im sorry :)"
CodAW,3df7rl,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:18 2015 UTC,I dunno. My thought process is your a lot more likely to be lined up on the body and not get the Hs with the first bullet or 2.
CodAW,3df7rl,ozarkslam21,0,Wed Jul 15 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"if you are at all good at aiming, you are going to get many more headshots by actually aiming for the head.  maybe if you have awful aim, then luck is a better option?even then i doubt it"

CodAW,3df7rl,steezaleeze21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:53 2015 UTC,Hardcore. Pick variant of gun with lowest accuracy. Burst fire high on target.

CodAW,3d9m3l,dpcdomino,0,Wed Jul 15 05:37:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't class is as giving you anything free. You paid for the game itself so you paid for the guns. Just lucky they didn't tack on an extra fee.
CodAW,3d9m3l,bslapshot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:57:47 2015 UTC,no.  the $60 price you paid to get the game entitles you to everything on the disc and nothing more
CodAW,3d9m3l,ozarkslam21,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:37 2015 UTC,Also entitles you to any free downloadable content. Therefore you prepaid with the original 60$ you spent. Is the glass half full or is the glass half empty?
CodAW,3d9m3l,thekyle1591,3,Tue Jul 14 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"it sounds half empty for you.  you seem mad that you think you've paid for something that likely wasn't even designed or proposed until many months after the games release, which you do get for free, but just not immediately.

CodAW,3d9m3l,its_only_pauly,5,Tue Jul 14 16:36:58 2015 UTC,I find that so hard to believe when I look over at GTA V (singleplayer)
CodAW,3d9m3l,link5057,9,Tue Jul 14 17:48:03 2015 UTC,Hardware limitations?   A royalty gun is practically another gun already in the game with a slight change to the stats if any and a new camo.   I fail to understand these hardware limitations too.
CodAW,3d9m3l,BlazeDemBeatz,3,Tue Jul 14 19:26:50 2015 UTC,RAM
CodAW,3d9m3l,ozarkslam21,2,Tue Jul 14 22:54:25 2015 UTC,GTA runs at sub 720p and at 30FPS
CodAW,3d9m3l,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Tue Jul 14 22:54:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure GTA V is a great example for what you're looking at, for it to run you have to install 1 disk onto the drive and then NOT install the second disk and play off it live so it can handle the world and there's still pop in issues with the world.  If you're using GTA V as an example of the limitations though, it's a good one, the entire game on XB1 can be downloaded so no need to use the disk at all, pop in is so much better, first person mode, and 1080p as well as more traffic and people."

CodAW,3d9m3l,ozarkslam21,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"That is not really an explanation though it is.   ""hardware limitation"" bollocks being spread by Activision and Sledgehammer would make you think it was impossible to do but it is not. Comparing a phone to a console or dropping in NES and a 64 in does nothing either.  ""That means the new weapons, which include non-Akimbo variants of the SAC3 and a special line of purple-camouflaged Royalty Elite guns, will never be coming to Xbox 360 or PS3, nor will any future additions to the weapon drop system.  Condrey was also careful to note that planned DLC packs will not be affected by the hardware limitations, so fans playing on Xbox 360 and PS3 can still expect to see new multiplayer maps and content for the Exo Zombies co-op mode.""  So that is it. No new weapons at all in future for last gen but we got some new gear added? And we have all the DLC to come but these guns magically cant be worked into the game? And all he says is   ""We have hit a hard memory limit on last generation consoles. This memory limit prevents us from adding more weapons to those platforms. We don’t like it any more than you, because we care about Advanced Warfare players on all platforms, but it’s a limitation that is outside of our control. People far smarter than I spend a lot of energy trying to solve this hard development limit, and we simply can’t deliver new content at the rate we’re currently producing it for next generation devices.”  Which is lets not do it, it will take too much time and hassle so the decision was made to just ignore last gen and make it easier for everyone."

By dropping new guns and such, they keep people interested. That's why they are in drops, so people will buy ASD's. It's all very calculated marketing.

CodAW,3d9s75,Lassie_Maven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not so naive as that--I realize that it's a marketing technique to sell more ASD's (especially considering you can't even use the weapons until you receive a variant from a Supply Drop). And I guarantee it will work.  My point was that they've been more involved with production than any CoD in the past. Is it financially motivated? Sure, they've got a business to run. But you don't HAVE to buy them to get Supply Drops or ASD's. Free is free is free, and I don't understand why people still cry about it--if you're not interested in spending the money, then don't.

I may complain about them adding to many clothes but it is nice to see them add something new and worthwhile. Even better, they're adding even more, also for free. The only problems are that these need to be earned through Supply Drops meaning when they add them to the game on X day, you wont be able to use it on X day. Also, for last gen users (Who were never officially told that not everything would make it to last gen) don't get it which kinda sucks because they paid just as much for the game. Now before you say ""they should of upgraded"" I'd just like to say, before it was announced the Royalty weapons wouldn't be added to last gen, there was no reason to upgrade other than better graphics and faster menus. The only differences between last gen AW and current gen AW is as previously stated, graphics, menus, few variants, more grass and details in some maps, faster updates, etc. Not much."

CodAW,3d9s75,onyxrecon008,3,Wed Jul 15 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"Last gen consoles don't have enough ram. When the map is loading, it is actually sending data to ram, which is faster than the hard drive. I assume the devs maxed out the ram with the map and regular textures. There may not be room for more data. Just a guess but may be the reason. Alternatively, the processor can't handle any more new gun physics.

I might even come back the 360 version now and again because I really do like the weapon balance as it is now, I don't need to see people running around with a ancient outdated weapon."
CodAW,3d9s75,Allegiance10,-5,Tue Jul 14 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"So us last-gen folk aren't getting the last 'dlc' weapon then, due to hardware limitations.... good to know in advance, I was contemplating getting BOIII  on next gem but this game has burned me out on anything COD.  Maybe the next Mass Effect game on next-gen might provide a much more interesting  multiplayer experience."
CodAW,3d9s75,Frogman360,3,Tue Jul 14 17:12:50 2015 UTC,Time to upgrade?
CodAW,3d9s75,davidman92,6,Tue Jul 14 20:27:35 2015 UTC,If you still play on last-gen you should expect to be shafted. These new consoles have been out for almost two full years.
CodAW,3d9s75,Frogman360,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"I bought the game before I had the next gen consoles. Unless there's a 'free upgrade' at this time, I don't expect to spend a cent on the next gen version of this game, much less the series.  There's still a majority of the population on last gen consoles, the price - tag for last gen versions was the whopping $60 just as next gen releases.....yet there's no 'compensation' for those of us who really getting jack due to cut content. (Something like a bonus 30 asds for all last gen people would be truly appreciated)"
CodAW,3d9s75,f0rsale,5,Tue Jul 14 17:20:25 2015 UTC,You're using 10 year old hardware that can't handle the free extra content because it's got a quarter as much RAM as the average modern cell phone.  Be glad you get anything at all.
CodAW,3d9s75,JudasCoyne,2,Tue Jul 14 17:25:35 2015 UTC,So I suppose saturating the loot pool with whacky outfits instead to keeping space for at least the base additional weapons is acceptable than?  I'll gladly trade in any and all of the ad exclusive loot if it means we get access to at least one of these weapons.
CodAW,3d9s75,f0rsale,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:35:57 2015 UTC,"The majority of the population is not last gen consoles, don't talk out of your ass. They should still release these weapons for them, if they released the game on both generations, then both generations should get full support."
CodAW,3d9s75,Allegiance10,2,Tue Jul 14 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"They should still release these weapons for them, if they released the game on both generations, then both generations should get full support.

CodAW,3ddb1i,RuriM,2,Wed Jul 15 11:19:47 2015 UTC,"When you have your exo disabled, your slide is just like the slide from Ghosts. Very boring and slow. Also, you get less distance on it."

If you watch someone sliding from behind, you'll notice their exo fires when they hit the dirt. If you exhaust your exo directional boosts, your default slide will be a regular slide, and it will be unaided by the exo suit. That is the slide you use when exo suits are disabled."

CodAW,3dcmaf,ACiDRiFT,2,Thu Jul 16 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"Strider is not a bad gun by any means, probably better than any other non ASM sub in the game. It excels at close range and is pretty much unmatched, but overall you lose the ability to win any medium to long range gunfights with an AR (which is the area that all subs besides the asm really struggle with in this game in my opinion)  I prefer the magnitude or the rigor to even the speakeasy - they still dominate up close and have a fair chance at medium range"
CodAW,3dcmaf,ItsMarkham,2,Wed Jul 15 12:36:59 2015 UTC,"I have gotten a fair amount of long range kills on solar from C DOM to B Bomb, it might be just luck but sometimes the strider doesn't even kick. the recoil is random and controllable, I only used the strider until I got the speakeasy now im tired of both and use ARs. I prefer Strider to Magnitude."

CodAW,3dawgp,JediMindTrxcks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:19:38 2015 UTC,I think the person meant one sensitivity in the fact that they don't change it game mode to game mode. So if the use sens 4 they stick with it for all game types. Not like using 4 for HP and UL and then using 8 for snd or something.
CodAW,3dawgp,sansol2100,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:10:35 2015 UTC,i can never play on 3 i keep switching from 7 to 12 sensitivity i feel like you move too slow at 3
CodAW,3dawgp,hussfares1,4,Wed Jul 15 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"That's the point. It makes your accuracy ridiculously good.

CodAW,3dawgp,milwaukeenic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"Nadeshot isn't running and gunning like most pub players, that's why he uses a 3.  Any tournament gameplay, it's usually sitting in one spot or moving slowly. Better aim = lower sensitivity.  Work on at least a 5 and adjust.  Also learn and master the exo suits movement to evade and move around the map quicker.  Don't just walk around corners, boost dash around them then double jump into a slide.  Also if you're deaths are ridiculously high, create a custom load out catered to being ""off the grid"" with hard wired."

CodAW,3db0jh,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:08:16 2015 UTC,I think that router is another cash grab just like gamer grip and G-Fuel.  I have 150 down and 50 up and I have never had this happen consistently on any other multiplayer game.

The laggier you were, the better off you were so everyone (the wannabe competitive community, yeah what a joke) was purposely lagging up lobbies and connections.

CodAW,3d9oa0,JediMindTrxcks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:44:58 2015 UTC,I don't think it's possible to derank on Xbox one/ps4 due to the fact they havent made any homebrew/whatever it is that allows for modification and hacking like on Jtags/RGHs/Jailbroken consoles in the previous generation. It's most definitely something server side with SH on X1/PS4. I couldn't say the same if this was on 360 though.

But because I'm a bronze with 50 points and the bronze on their team has 0, we get the 'favoured match-up'. And of course I lost because turns out they were all friends and I was solo queueing.  Or I'm playing SnD, pretty even teams and we lose first round stupidly from some dumb plays or they just had the better aim. Teammates proceed to leave after just that first round leaving it a 3v4. I've still won 2v4's on Biolab because that map is easy to clutch, but yeah, not a fan of ranked play at all. Also, why the fuck are their variants in a competitive setting."

CodAW,3dadr5,rmx687,2,Tue Jul 14 20:18:09 2015 UTC,Only two times/situations that I have found cloak useful.   1)   Domination on Solar - Wait for a team mate to take back B flag. Hopefully he stands in the middle of B. I hit cloak and I lay just out the middle tunnel thing. They kill him and then think where is the person taking B. Really confuses them. By the time they get close enough hopefully I have helped my team take B and I'm out of there.  2)  Hard Point on Terrace - One hard point is the pool on this map. Cloak and laying in the pool seems to make you pretty much invisible. Pop up shoot someone and pop back down. But if they watch the kill cam your screwed. If not hopefully your team mates keep them away and you lay in there getting some points. Die? Come back jump in lay down and hit cloak.   I love people using cloak because it is useless and they seem to think they are invisible. It is called cloak for a reason.
CodAW,3dadr5,its_only_pauly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:22:41 2015 UTC,It's useless. It might work at long range but it's completely useless at close to mid range.
CodAW,3dadr5,poklane,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:20 2015 UTC,use cloak and overclock together with a shotgun or SMG.  Fun Times.
CodAW,3dadr5,McTwizle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:08 2015 UTC,I'd save the point myself but it can be useful. Just remember that you aren't invisible but you won't catch peoples eyes as easily from a distance.

Or, maps like ascend or comeback where they have an entrance you need to cross. Having this and overclocking helps take over the room.   Its just enough to get you a slight advantage to get the kill first."
CodAW,3dadr5,maxhatcher,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:48:54 2015 UTC,"It's most effective when you're in dark areas hugging the wall.

CodAW,3dadr5,OutlandishDigital,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:22:16 2015 UTC,I always thought that ppl who use cloak gotta feel stupid when they die while invisible.  I'm gonna have to face the music and use this dumb ass ability to complete the challenge though 😳

CodAW,3d9dvb,KishKosh13,4,Tue Jul 14 15:09:38 2015 UTC,"Round house is a bit better than the sledgehammer IMO, but it is the best elite version of the Tac-19."
CodAW,3d9dvb,dtate24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"It depends on which attachments you are using. If you are using quickdraw, the round house is better, but if you are using laser sight on the sledgehammer you go from 8 max hipfire spread to 6.8, which is a really big reduction when you compare it to the normal tac19 spread of 10. It's hipfire is so tight that if you go prone you can easily get OHKs further than the 2 pellet kill range, which is useful for certain objective points.  But if you are running quickdraw then it doesn't matter because ads spread is 5.5 which works well with the roundhouse's extended 2 pellet kill range."
CodAW,3d9dvb,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"Whirlwind with Quickdraw and Ex Mags. Mmm.  I did a whole prestige with the S12 and an overkill Hole Puncher.   So much fun, so much salt."

CodAW,3d9dvb,Dayman_ah-ah-ah,3,Tue Jul 14 15:09:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on variants. Personally, I'd day the S12 Whirlwind or the Tac-19 Roundhouse if you have either. Tried the bulldog and really didnt like it, despite having both elites."

CodAW,3d9dvb,OppaWumboStyle,2,Tue Jul 14 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think so. It's the only variant with increased range, and combined with the fire rate, it's a monster"
CodAW,3d9dvb,Bearsnickles,2,Tue Jul 14 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"Have to agree. Roundhouse defo the best variant, esp in HC due to increased fire rate"
CodAW,3d9dvb,docmagoo2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"The best Bulldog is the Rifled IMO, (yes even better than the Facehammer). Drift0r did a review for this one.

CodAW,3d9dvb,RooneysHairPlugs,3,Wed Jul 15 04:15:25 2015 UTC,"I play with shotguns most of the time and the two I use are the Bulldog Diplomacy and the S12 Tiger Blood.  My go-to gun in all of AW is the Bulldog Diplomacy.  I was initially drawn to it because of the free foregrip that is included.  Granted, you need to get advanced rifling on it ASAP, but once you have that it can be a great close-range gun but is also effective at medium-range too.  It's a real pain in the ass, but if you can manage to unlock extended mags, this gun becomes a monster; can easily clear out a Dom flag or hardpoint.  I mostly ADS while using it.  I should mention that I haven't received the Facehammer yet, so I can't speak to how good it is.  Also, i just got the Mancy recently, but haven't really used it yet.  My other preferred shotty is the S12 Tiger Blood.  The key to using it though, is attaching the laser site.  With it attached, your hipspread is actually better the base version, plus you're still getting the increased sprint-out time and fire rate.  The laser sight improves the hipspread enough to where the difference in spreads between hipfiring and ADS is negligible unless you're standing completely still.  That means you basically don't ever have to ADS with the Tiger Blood, so don't worry about attaching the quickdraw grip, stock, or any of the sights.  Also, I highly recommend adding extended mags as well.  The jump from 8 to 12 shots per mag is huge.  You could also add advanced rifling if you want, but I've found that the viewkick can make it difficult to engage enemies at medium-range, even with adv rifling.  This setup is great for getting double- and triple-kills, and you can take down a Goliath before they even know what hit them.  I mostly use this class when playing Hardpoint.  A final note: it won't help you with the Marksmen challenge directly, but I always equip two semtex with my shotgun classes.  In order for a shotty class to be a viable all-rounder, you need to be able to engage enemies at long-range, or else you'll just get picked off all the time.  Having dual semtex allows me to address enemies that are far away.  I might not always kill them, but at the very least I can make them have to dodge, which gives me that little bit of time I need to duck into a doorway or around a corner."

CodAW,3d9dvb,Terkey,3,Tue Jul 14 15:34:34 2015 UTC,Shotguns don't even need grip
CodAW,3d9dvb,42z3ro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:55:25 2015 UTC,"I use it on the S12 while ADS'ing because of the ridiculous amount of recoil. The range on the S12 is actually pretty good, but ADS'ing is essential for longer-range gunfights (for me, at least)"
CodAW,3d9dvb,42z3ro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:09:13 2015 UTC,I use it with ADS too. It has a good amount of spread so that accuracy doesn't affect it too much. Its your choice though
CodAW,3d9dvb,BasedBisharp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:00 2015 UTC,Switch the grip out for a stock so you can strafe around corners. Grip is useless because its not a precision weapon.
CodAW,3d9dvb,ProtectoRofAssguarD,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:09:25 2015 UTC,"Yea its great. Grip isn't needed though because you're pretty much just spraying and dont need to be accurate. Put a stock so you can strafe around corners, advanced rifling and ext mags. Enjoy annihilating everyone at close range."
CodAW,3d9dvb,Fundthemental,2,Tue Jul 14 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"S-12 Tiger Blood with extended mags is straight up destruction.  As for the Tac-19, ehh, I can never make my mind up between the Sledgehammer, Roundhouse and Upper Cut... Roundhouse seems most consistent.  The Rifled and the Face Hammer are the best variants for the Bulldog, with the Face Hammer being the absolute best. Rifled's extra range is always nice. Mancy is worth the mention because it has no direct disadvantages."

CodAW,3d9dvb,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:19:55 2015 UTC,"Tac19 sledgehammer w/ advanced rifling, laser sight, and ext mags. The hipfire spread is nearly ADS tight so you don't have to waste time ADSing and the ammo is 10 w/extended mags so you don't have to worry about reloading as much. I use it with lightweight, gung-ho (sprint canceling negates the gung-ho penalty), and blast suppressor. As long as you center your target you will get 1hks within 8-10 meters and 2hks within twice that range."
CodAW,3d9dvb,sonichu1488,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:34 2015 UTC,What's the point in using gung ho if you're not sprinting?
CodAW,3d9dvb,DidUknowiPwn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"You can still sprint. What you do is abuse sprint canceling by doing the following:  1) sprint around like you normally do  2) center your target  3) cancel your sprint (either on the ground or in mid air) by feathering the left trigger  4) fire your tac-19  5) sprint again  6) repeat steps 2,3,and 4 until the target is dead.  Step 4 is one or two frames after step 3 and works. You WILL get normal hipfire spread instead of gung-ho spread. And step 5 is immediately after you fire so it's like you don't stop sprinting except for those few frames where you cancel your sprint and fire.  As a result the only time the gung-ho penalty really matters is when you go for slide shots, but let's be honest, nobody does slide shots anyway.  Try it out, I guarantee you will find it works."
CodAW,3d9dvb,JediMindTrxcks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"Tac 19 sledgehammer acts the most like a traditional COD pump shotgun, S12 is all about getting close and personal and letting go of the trigger(just makes sure to always equip extended mags). Bulldog is balanced and you can use it as a rusher shotgun or as a primary for close quarter maps. It all depends on you and the situation. You could always wait until we get the blunderbuss, that thing is going to be a olympia on crack cocaine"

Fast Hands also helps if you're going to be using stuns.  Also, if you don't want to play Hardcore, you can try regular Domination or Momentum.

CodAW,3d5jyi,TimeverseTheory,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"I've had a lot of fury kills. A handful I've gotten with a gun but they're really simple to get with kill streaks. I think in one match alone last night I had 2 triples, a fury a super and 2 megas. I play ground war predominately and domination in that mode makes these kinda kills super easy. I've never had a DNA let alone a 30+ kill streak (my patience stops me from doing this, a 20-25 streak is ussually where I can get  before death) but that's how my friend got the kill chain by getting a DNA bomb in infected."

CodAW,3d5jyi,bebaker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:48:26 2015 UTC,You have to just get lucky with a double bombing run. You dont have enough time to call in other streaks and the paladin or war bird just makes the other team hide indoors before you drop your bombing run. Ive got an ultra kill in ground war but i had to get the kill chain in infected.
CodAW,3d5jyi,42z3ro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:21:24 2015 UTC,that's true about hiding indoors. I was picturing running AI warbirds and drones. U can have more than one AI drone in the air at the same time. Though I've never had the kill chain I've gotten everything below and can achieve them on a regular day of playing. Something I'll keep working on but I think it'll just happen natrually

Second we know that the 3 new weapons are NEW weapons, although they each have a similarity to an existing weapon:   blunderbluss has massive spread, one shot, and a 4 second reload in exchange for shooting 18 pellets that have the same damage and range as tac19 pellets. stg44 has the same damage numbers of the hbra3 (40-33-24), but has less range, lower fire rate, no intro firerate boost, and a lot less recoil. It basically renders the AE4 useless, unless you think that 30 damage range on the AE4 is actually useful (it's not except for HC) the SVO has the same multipliers has the MORS has now but is semi auto with moderately high recoil. I'm also assuming that it has more sway than the MORS because otherwise it would render the MORS useless."

If you're good at zombies in the Treyarch games strangely enough you'll be good at this.  An easy strategy to try is choosing heavy class, and using the goliath almost every round.  Something you need to remember when playing is that you don't need to win gunfights, you need to stay alive, so if someones shooting at you, focus on getting the hell out of the way before shooting them back.

Has the weapons crate inside. Face the crate, turn around, and there are some pipes against a wall; jump on them and hide in the little nook. You can also boost jump up onto a ledge that shouldn't be there, directly above. From there, you can focus your gunfire on the two places that the AI can jump to - one of which being more common than the other. You can also place a turret in the tunnel nearby, in the corner by the weapons crate. Have your other weapon be a rocket launcher you're comfortable with, or an LMG with a LOT of power. This is for warbirds. Goliaths can be melee'd three times to kill them, or you can boost slam directly at their heads. The latter is trickier. Collect ammo drops when you can, buy ammo when you can't. Donezo."

CodAW,3d75fv,cyph3x,2,Tue Jul 14 18:38:07 2015 UTC,That's the hardest part. If they're jumping aim for the closest wall/ground/ceiling. It's powerful enough to kill from the ground even when they're at the peak of their exo jump. But yeah it is super hard to hit jumping people especially at open parts like terrace but there's usually enough walls to get the kill. Just remember never aim directly at them because as weird as it sounds hitting them usually means you won't get the kill unless it's a headshot.

CodAW,3d75fv,EFG,3,Sat Jul 18 13:09:18 2015 UTC,Virtuosity is for quickscoping. I recommend it. People who aren't as good at sniping such as myself tend to do better with the 20mm than with the MORS. If you get the snapper try that out too. It has more sway but with extended mags you get 7 rounds. I like it for quickscoping.

I actually agree with you that this isn't a common situation however how does it make any sense that you need to delete everything and reinstall instead of just deleting the addons you don't want anymore?  In my case it was Ghosts. I had 3 map packs installed and various other DLC. I wanted to just delete the map packs because I couldn't find any games. I had to delete something like 50gbs and then re-download 35gb. So unless I missed the settings page that allows me to delete addons the OP is going to have to go through the same process likely.

So to get them back, i simply went on my download list and downloaded it again but i didnt go through with download because it first activates it and then downloads it which you dont need to download it. This may sound confusing but its worth a try, but remember, after deactivating your account, remember to activate it again so that you can download stuff again onto your playstation."
CodAW,3d82ds,KishKosh13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:09:00 2015 UTC,Another example for this is you want to delete just the atlas gorge map and you want to keep the supremacy dlc for example. You would do the de-activation process and then activate your account again which then go onto your download list where the supremacy dlc is and download it again but dont actually download it as it first activates it which you dont then need to download it.
CodAW,3d82ds,KishKosh13,0,Tue Jul 14 11:13:54 2015 UTC,there are plenty of people playing the DLC maps. deleting them exacerbates the problem for everybody else

CodAW,3d7vxs,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:03:48 2015 UTC,"Don't do HC for the hipfire challenge of the epm3. Just play core and spam right trigger like your life depends on it.  The reason I say to not do it on HC is because it's most guns kill in 1 hit at hipfire range anyway, so you're basically at a disadvantage unless you can constantly fire at 720+ rpm and even then the hipfire spread of the epm3 is bad. At least in core you have a chance of getting a 2hk if you get a headshot and you have the advantage of a close range 3hk compared to many guns that are 4hks.  I personally hate the epm3. I think SHG went the wrong route with buffing it. They should at this point just  make the damage 70-50-34, return the headshot multi to 1.2, make the centerspeed 1250, make the exterminator have a 1.5 headshot multi, and make the lower damage variants 70-50-33 and 70-42-33.  Then they should buff the mk14 by reducing the centerspeed to 1300, changing the damage to 34-33-30, and changing the 1.1 multi to a 1.6 torso and neck multi."

CodAW,3d7vxs,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:40:43 2015 UTC,Yeah that works a ton. I did the same thing on epm3. Ads and then release it when u know they're close enough for a hipfire.

Well, except for the fact that some textures still look low-res as fuck, even on Extra. A shame that the DOF effect only looks good in campaign, while it looks somewhat meh in multiplayer and Zombies.  Also, are you setting colorblind filter to On? I noticed the colors on Cormack's armor look different."
CodAW,3d3mm7,RdJokr,2,Mon Jul 13 09:53:39 2015 UTC,The main problem with sp is the fixed fov. Presumably it's done so for those qte style scenes but it's still unacceptable in a fps.

Along with this i hate ground ware in this game as i used to play gw to step the pace up of slow 6v6 in previous cods, but this game is perfect in 6v6 core and gw i have to be on my shit to lead/win and i get frustrated and tired more doing that so its hard to play longer. also in gw dom, its not a race to b flag or keep flags, its a race to your streaks cause who ever gets it first is going to push some s*** in and win, there is no clawing back."

I.D Authenticator   Same as above   EMP Shielding device   IMO would work better as a perk. Otherwise, this is a cool idea.   Hollow Points   Good idea but needs tweaking   Bipod Grip   Sounds a bit dumb, but IMO would work much better if it greatly increased accuracy while prone.   Angled Grip   That's a lot of buffs for that...,   Variable Thermal Scope   I've always wanted different thermal options. Have there be different scopes in the game, but have each scope have a Thermal option to it. IMO that would be cool.   Underrail   Could be fun, if it's only for LMGs. On some other weapons it would be bull. And even on some AW guns, like the OHM it would be really bull.  Dragon's breath  Sounds REALLY REALLY bad   Ammo Pack   I'd tweak it so it was the counterpart ot Extended Mags. Where instead of a larger magazine, you get a larger reserve.So instead of a weapon only getting, say, 3 reloads, they might get 4."

Compensator-Reduces visual kick(no increase in accuracy)  Mag guide-Increases the reloading speed of your weapon, but it's still not as fast as speed reloads  Gas Block-Increases mobility(your movement speed)  Gas systems kit-Increases damage, but all other attachments are now incompatible ,minus the sights, under barrels and dual mags/extended mags. Available on all regular guns, including Lynx S12 and all the pistols(but minus the bulldog since it operates on another firing mechanism)  Scope-Low power sniper scope for Mk14. Similar performance to it's ghosts/MW2 variants  Barrel Upgrade-Decreases drop off damage(increasing maximum possible range damage)"
CodAW,3d3b15,Maschinengewehr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:24:31 2015 UTC,"Compensator might be cool, but probably not very useful.   Mag guide could work, but I like that dual mags is already only available for some weapons and the fast reload mechanic is good enough already.   Gas Block is basically lightweight, so it would be pointless  Gas systems kit sounds like it would be overpowered, especially since you don't really need any attachments on a lot of guns and can still do fine. I think something like high damage bullets could work as an attachment if it lowered your mag size and increased recoil, but even then it'd probably be a bit too powerful. I like Treyarch's idea with the attachment that increases headshot multipliers in BO3  Scope for MK14 would be cool, but I don't know how useful it'd be since this game has mostly CQC maps/engagements  Barrel upgrade sounds exactly like advanced rifling, so it'd be pointless"

CodAW,3d5g8y,Tayette,3,Mon Jul 13 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"The .308 has increased recoil and hipfire spread.  It gains 30 INCHES on its close-range damage and 180 INCHES on it's mid-range damage.  That is about the length of an adult leg added to the first range and about three adults laying down, foot-to-head, to the second range.  This is not a fair trade and you'd generally play better with the original BAL, seeing as it has less recoil. You will rarely find a situation where those tiny range changes are worth it."
CodAW,3d5g8y,JudasCoyne,3,Mon Jul 13 20:00:41 2015 UTC,".308 is a pointless variant, the range increase is around a metre or so, it doesn't help the 3 shot range at all, and the increase to the 4 shot range almost non existent"

Also as far as I know, timed gear like the bloodshed helmet, will not grant a 5% bonus, probably because it lasts for 30 min and how on earth are you going to get all the pieces in 30 min?"

CodAW,3d5k8b,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:10:00 2015 UTC,"Also, the fact you need to drop 20+ kills, to get all pieces of bloodshed, probably gives you the sense of achievement, of wearing it in game, but as said before no benefits."
CodAW,3d5k8b,d1rTb1ke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:12 2015 UTC,30+ with the Exo. For 30 minutes and it to disappear. Not to mention the bug that if u say have 3-4 pieces already then aquire the rest next match the aquired  pieces from previous match expire and don't get refreshed. They really need to make this set last longer. 2-4 hours seems reasonable. I not a pro and getting 25 kills without dying is not an easy feat for a 30 minute reward.
CodAW,3d5k8b,BJGreenDream,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:37:37 2015 UTC,"the spawning doesn't help you keep your team together, so there's no real cut and dry battle lines anymore. even the team games feel like FFA. i wouldn't spend any $ on drops, i tried and never got anything worthwhile. but i did get some great variants like the BAL inferno in my first prestige. i wish we could trade stuff with each other like in elder scrolls."
CodAW,3d5k8b,BJGreenDream,0,Mon Jul 13 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"So what's with drops? Like, armor for example. My full set gives +5% XP, that's dope. Then I get a bloodshed helmet drop for 30m. No bonus. Just a neato healmet. Why would I give up my 5% XP to wear a helmet for 30 minutes?  I'm honestly completely lost right now. It's fun, though."
CodAW,3d5k8b,BJGreenDream,0,Mon Jul 13 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you're so obsessed with the armors and +5% xp crap. Normal armors are earned from supply drops you get every 45 mins or by completing challenges, and the 30 minute stuff you get from performing well in-game. Don't worry about it though, nobody wears the timed gear anyways. As for the point of it, not really sure, but I would guess it's to keep you playing at a level that earns you that stuff consistently, and challenges you to earn it again once it expires."
CodAW,3d5k8b,purehatred89,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:29:04 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is me playing Destiny for the last month, so the prospect of loot got me excited. The weapon drops are awesome - loving that aspect. It's just a lot of shit is like ""yeah you got this drop"" with no explanation."
CodAW,3d5k8b,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah okay, I can see where you're coming from. And yeah the loot system is a bit strange in this game. I also have no idea why I get drops sometimes. I think (and this is a wild guess) that you get them for using different guns a lot or trying new things, which is when I seem to get the most. Also, if you die a bunch of times in a row, especially at the start of a match, you'll almost definitely get a drop, I suppose just to throw you a bone so you keep playing. Also the general consensus is that you get one every 45 minutes or so of play time (in match) no matter what. Try the daily challenges too. They pop up on the right side of the screen when you go to find match, and they will also net you a supply drop. It takes a while to get used to, but its very rewarding. Oh, and don't make the same mistake everyone else did when we first started. If you go into armory, DON'T redeem rare stuff like Elite and Legendary gear for xp (unless you have doubles of something), as it will probably be a very long time before you see them in another drop."
CodAW,3d5k8b,BlazeDemBeatz,0,Mon Jul 13 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, appreciate the help. Better to shard all the armor and green guns for XP and keep blue/orange weapons around then?"
CodAW,3d5k8b,BJGreenDream,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"No problem. And yes exactly, sell the enlisted stuff and keep the elites and whatnot. There are a few exceptions though.

CodAW,3d5k8b,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"For the most part, yes. Though there are some green weapons that are actually very good. Some examples are the KF5 Single Stack and IMR Impact."

CodAW,3d5k8b,BlazeDemBeatz,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"U don't get a drop for dying a bunch of times in a match. That's a myth. It's triggered by the 45 minute timer, the message will show up wether you get a few kills or die a few times regardless as long as it's within the 45 min. So please don't run around dying every match hoping for a SD as you won't get one"

CodAW,3d37hx,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Mon Jul 13 23:33:54 2015 UTC,I'll give you a good tip for xmgs. Those I also dreaded. I saved them for last. But actually they are really really fun and OP. Lower your sensitivity all the way down to like 1-2 because your always gonna have loose aim with them. Also run rapid fire. The variants I swapped between were bread and butter or Venus and Mars. But another key to making these things OP was using on long lines of site and using lockdown mode. Your like a walking turret. Any time u get a chance or that extra second to react make sure u lock them down. Prob one of the coolest weapons in the game tbh. You'll have fun I'm pretty sure. Just make sure you keep yourself out of situations where u can be shot in the back. That was one of my weaknesses with them I'd lock down and get 1 kill then someone would get me from behind were I was vulnerable during lockdown
CodAW,3d37hx,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:25:25 2015 UTC,My main issue with them is the lockdown mode. I hate the idea of not moving. I'm sure I'll grow to like them though. Thanks for the tips!

The perk is sort of like how stopping power was in older COD's, in that you were at a disadvantage from everyone else just by not running it, because pretty much everyone else is using it (or at least, the other good players are going to be using it). If you really want scavenger on your class then you'd probably be best off removing a grenade/killstreak/secondary/attachment and run both perks in the third slot. (I always run toughness and blast suppressor in my third slot), but it probably isn't worth dropping toughness for scavenger."

But still, the way I see it, fast reloading is a luxury, either I reload normally when I know I have time or I speed reload when I'm under ten bullets (since I can still get a kill with anything over ten most of the time). Not worth losing toughness imo"
CodAW,3d25jc,cyph3x,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:08:39 2015 UTC,Depends on the gun. For the s12 and bulldog scavenger is a must. It's also helpful if you are running a fast firing weapon with low ammo such as the inferno or the mp11. The thing about fast reload is that when you are running scavenger it's no longer just some luxurious option but THE way to reload.

It really is a major disadvantage not using blast surpressor and toughness. If you dont have like a 3 KD and get DNAs every other Lobby, I dont recommend it. Just pick up weapons on the ground."
CodAW,3d25jc,Maschinengewehr,2,Sun Jul 12 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"I don't use it that much anymore. If you can flank well, then you shouldn't need it. Some guns also feel like they don't get much benefit from it to me"
CodAW,3d25jc,icedblackcoffee,2,Sun Jul 12 23:05:03 2015 UTC,"Toughness helps for mid range and helps a ton for long range. If you are running any gun that relies on long range accurate power then toughness helps a lot.  It's not as useful though for shotguns and smgs where short range power and hipfire are key.  Honestly the only OP perk is blast suppresor. They should have countered blast suppressor by making parabolic mic also show blast suppressed boosts, but in return have parabolic mic increase hipfire by 15%, increase recoil by 15%, and reduce range by 15%."

CodAW,3d25jc,s0meMurk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:07:28 2015 UTC,"One thing I would recommend if you have enough slots in make 2 classes, one with Toughness and one with Scavenger. That way if you stay in the same lobby for a few matches and you know people are using stock you can use Toughness and pick up their guns. If not use Scavenger. SMGs don't really need stock so you could use either with those."
CodAW,3d25jc,fadedfeat,2,Mon Jul 13 07:11:48 2015 UTC,"No, not as necessary but it helps. I run it on all of my AK classes, snipers, anything long range and precise.

CodAW,3d25jc,Creviced,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:30:48 2015 UTC,Toughness is one of the most useless perks in the game imo. Scavenger is great because not only will you never run out of bullets but you can fast reload every time also. I only use either hardline or scavenger depending on my class.
CodAW,3d25jc,gojira1980,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:37:18 2015 UTC,"Toughness is probably the best perk in AW or at least tied with Blast Suppressor. The worst part about it is that AW has so many crutch perks for many players. Lightweight, Low Profile, Blind Eye, Toughness and Blast Suppressor are all crutch in some way, and they are usually the perks on each of my classes. Combine that with an exo and the fact that most guns in this game need 3 attachments for maximum potential, you're left with no room to experiment with other perks or even use killstreaks.  I'm not saying we should be super soldiers, but the fact that I need so many perks to have a decent AW experience goes to show how terrible the perk balance is."

CodAW,3d25jc,smokinjoe65,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"I have always played with toughness. I'm surprised when I see people say they do not need it.  I have tried to play without it to make room for other perks in slot 3 but my game play suffered so I went back to it.   This may sound really stupid but when I have had long gun streaks and in general I tend to walk over people I killed when I can and if there is a nice looking gun that I am happy with I pick it up as my secondary. Your always going to find a Bal on the floor im sure and its a gun I can play with. I would ditch it if it has an acog scope on or something like that which for me is useless. And when my primary runs out I then will swap it out when I see another usable gun for me so if I'm doing well I continue the game with two guns from the ground.  It's nice to quickly test the gun out to see if it has a grip, stock or quick draw. Other things are noticeable so extended mags a silencer etc etc. I am so used to scavenging for a gun that I do not ever consider scavenger now that I never go without ammo.  Depending on the game mode or map I will only pick up a certain type of gun SMG or LMG etc etc.   Anyway, that is how I get around the lack of ammo. But going on a 10 kill streak and switching from an ASM1 to an AK 12 RIP which I picked up can be strange to adjust to. But then it can also be helpful as if I see someone in the distance I already know that I can win the gun fight with ease. Whereas if I only had the ASM1 I would probably take cover and not engage or work my way around for the kill."

It feels like such a beginner streak that once people reach a certain prestige they shouldn't be allowed to use it anymore. Also, you shouldn't have to waste space on perks that are near mandatory just to combat one problem, it's just poor game design. So people up-voting that you can just perk it out need realize you shouldn't even have to, it should have a limited radius or cost more.

CodAW,3d0np9,MisterLemon,2,Sun Jul 12 17:06:59 2015 UTC,Shut up I'm fucking tired of wanting the hole puncher nerfed
CodAW,3d0np9,icedblackcoffee,-2,Sun Jul 12 18:08:30 2015 UTC,it's not even a huge nerf that I'm suggesting though. Just a slight recoil increase so that the accuracy variations matter and a range rework so that 1)people start using ARXs besides the hole puncher and steel bite 2) silencer actually has a notable penalty on the hole puncher.  Are you by chance the kind of person that doesn't think the asm1 needs a real nerf?
CodAW,3d0np9,MisterLemon,3,Sun Jul 12 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"The ARX takes skill. Burst fire weapons should not be nerfed. They've always been top tier guns (M16 in MW1 and 2, Type 95 in MW3, SWAT in BO2...) that require skill to use. Just like a sniper- they are high skill, high reward weapons"
CodAW,3d0np9,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. the ARX is a burst gun, but it fires so fast and has such a small burst delay that there isn't much penalty if you miss a few shots. That's why the range should be changed to 900-1500. Keep in mind that without a silencer you would still be able to one burst someone up to 1500 which is pretty far.  I agree that the Swat in BO2 was a high skill gun but the type 95 was not. ""What's the difference?"" You might ask. Fire rate. The type 95 fired really quickly and had little burst delay unlike the swat. This allowed people to spam the type 95 until they got the kill.  I think all ARXs unsilenced should 1 burst kill up to 900 units so that they can compete with the imr and I think that the silenced range of the HP and SB makes more sense as an unsilenced range considering how easy it is to spam the ARX and how accurate it is.  Also, the ammo should be changed to 36 rounds."
CodAW,3d0np9,pedroef,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:54:04 2015 UTC,Is it just me or the the ARXs have more delay than the IMRs? If that's the case I think that the burst ARs are well balanced comparing one to another.

CodAW,3d0np9,WigglyWastebin,2,Mon Jul 13 13:53:40 2015 UTC,And not to mention having no option of a optical isn't bad because 1.) That's subjective and 2.) The silencer can reduce the flash and clearing up the sights.  I think it's negatives should have been -1 accuracy and no attachments at all.

While they are at it they should also increase the recoil of the asm1 by 20-30% to balance out the asm1 and the speakeasy better and change the range of the ARX to 900-1500 and slightly increase the recoil to balance out the hole puncher and steel bite."

CodAW,3d0np9,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:04:04 2015 UTC,Actually lots of people agree with the idea. I don't see what is wrong with my nerf ideas. They nerfed the MSMC in black ops 2 by adding recoil why can't they do the same thing to the asm1 and bal27. And I don't think anyone would disagree with the notion that the ARX needs to be tweaked so that variants besides the hole puncher and steel bite are useful.
CodAW,3d0np9,Tenshi-01,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:07:31 2015 UTC,The no recoil usually comes with the Foregrip actually working in this game.
CodAW,3d0np9,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"Even without foregrip, the asm1 is the most accurate smg, which it shouldn't be. The whole idea of giving the asm1 more recoil is to specialize it to close range. As for the bal, the reason to give it a little more recoil is to partly encourage less bal use and mostly so that the +10 recoil on the Obsidian Steed becomes more detrimental."

I've even found myself switching from the ""Steed"" to ""Inferno"" in ""Ranked Play"". I think more people should give it a try.

EDIT: I play pretty aggressively and do way more close to mid range than long range. If you play slower and do a lot of long range Grip is mandatory."
CodAW,3d0np9,imrlybord7,2,Sun Jul 12 15:13:18 2015 UTC,i found the recoil a bit annoying without the foregrip. laser sight is there cause i'm too lazy to aimdown at close range. still melts people.
CodAW,3d0np9,its_only_pauly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:15:37 2015 UTC,Laser is a weak attachment but if Stock or Extended Mags really don't sound useful to you then I guess it's a decent choice.
CodAW,3d0np9,imrlybord7,0,Sun Jul 12 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"I agree the laser doesn't add a lot to the gun. The change is little. But it depends on your play style. I used to hip fire and use it to judge the centre of the screen, although that is easy enough.  I don't use quick draw so it can save me in a close gun fight. If you use quick draw and can pre fire and aim down sight super quick then there is no need for a laser sight as pointed out.   I go for extended mags as my 3rd attachment I rarely use stock.    I was so happy when I got my insanity but I can't get used to the sight when going for a medium to long range kill. It also must have a foregrip and silencer for me. Without those its not really a gun I can use.   As mentioned get your first 4 shots on target you win the gun fight. If you at all miss the first shot and move around trying to get shots onto the target you can easily struggle with the gun this is what happens to me medium to long range I can't melt people with it!"

CodAW,3czs78,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"Game wasn't made for competitive FFA without exos, especially with the newer maps. I thought about the classic only players and made the exo suit a reward for some of the game modes to balance it out. I actually wouldn't mind a old school classic FFA playlist with weapon, perk and launcher spawns, with the moon jump replacing the exo like in cod4"
CodAW,3czs78,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"With that logic, the game wasn't made for ANY game mode without exos. FFA is a staple game mode for every shooter. It wouldn't have taken too much in the way of resources to add one extra game mode in classic."
CodAW,3czs78,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:17:15 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that the maps aren't made for a chaotic FFA without exos like in the previous games and the playlist would be: A) Unbalanced and unfun B) Barren like the rest of the classic playlists.   The old school mode would bring back nostalgia for the older players like myself and bring the newer players in because it's something new they haven't seen. At this point, if you don't like the exos or whatever BO3 will pull, I would just stick to the old COD games instead. In my eyes, Ghosts was the perfection to the oldschool COD formula, and every new game has to add something new to keep the things fresh. Nobody wants to see COD go the way of guitar hero(another activision franchise)."
CodAW,3czs78,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:24:54 2015 UTC,"So why did they put TDM and mosh pit into a game full of maps designed for exos? A lot of people still play classic regardless of what the maps were designed for, and that number would grow if FFA was part of the mix instead of using the game disk as a coaster."
CodAW,3czs78,smokinjoe65,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Also, people wouldn't want an exo reward in classic. This is why they play classic in the first place. Casual players are already dominated by players with more experience and skill. Are you going to give those skilled players the ability to exo jump/dive/dash when 80% of the lobby wouldn't have that opportunity? It would create an awful imbalance."
CodAW,3czs78,its_only_pauly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:21:21 2015 UTC,"Old cod games had the juggernaut suit. It's the same thing really, except it gives players mobility instead of sheer killing force. If it's a earned streak, then it would reward players who are good enough to get it. This is the same mentality cod had since 2007 with COD4, throwing exo suit killstreak in the mix gives barely any more imbalance than constant system hacks, walker tanks or warbirds"
CodAW,3czs78,Cam_The_Man,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:28:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't compare it to juggernaut at all. Juggernaut is easy to counter. A skilled player with the ability to jump all over the map is imbalanced when the rest of the lobby is being outshot and outmaneuvered for the rest of the game. There is a limit to how much you should reward someone. That's like rewarding campers with wall hacks.

I personally would love to see the see the bulldog with the ark, it could have crazy range and fire the OHM laser bullets.

CodAW,3cw6kl,GooeyGunk,4,Sat Jul 11 07:58:15 2015 UTC,Probably the only reason I'll ever jump back on AW is to play with the STG. God I want a WW2 COD so badly.

CodAW,3cw6kl,syek14,2,Sat Jul 11 07:50:35 2015 UTC,2 positives and 1 negative appears to be Legendary stats.  that one Elite with 2 positives and 1 negative is obviously just because Royaltys gives 10% more range now so instead of giving it that range after 2 negative range nerfs just remove 1 range nerf to compensate.

Other than that the weapons look awesome. Only thing missing now is an energy based, high damage, very slow firing smg with damage at 49-25-18 and range 500-900 and rpm of 550.  They also desperately need to rework the epm3 so that it can 2 body shot kill up to 1040 but add recoil so it can't be spammed and buff the mk14 so it can 2 body shot kill up to 650 and add minor recoil so that accuracy variants and grip help."

CodAW,3cw6kl,docmagoo2,2,Sat Jul 11 11:46:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this game has a lot of smgs. If they buffed the sn6 by reducing the horizontal recoil, increasing the magazine size to 40, and increasing the first few rounds to 1800 rpm (that way people would notice the increase in rpm of the first few rounds), then people would have another viable smg to use. They also should increase the damage on the kf5 and sn6 to 33-24-19 just to give those guns a little oomph and they should increase the recoil on the asm1 by 20-30% and increase the recoil on the bal27 by 15% to reign in those two guns a little.  It's a shame that these three dlc guns are probably the last guns, because they should have made an energy based smg that fires at 550 rpm, does 49-24-18 damage at ranges 500-900, and has a 1.1 headshot multipier."

It is not like OP's problem is a big deal, that it happens regularly or often, unless he is killing his squad constantly.  I end up killing a teammate nearly every game - shit happens, especially with score streaks and objectives. But I get kicked, kill more than two teammates, only about 1 in 20 games. Maybe once or twice my own teammates were so pissed that they killed me in revenge - just not something to worry about."

CodAW,3czkg8,sonichu1488,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"All of them. DLC1 fives you a small map, DLC2 gives you a massive open world map but you have to rescue survivors like it's Dead Rising or something, and then there is carrier which will remind you of the old treyarch zombies most out of the three maps, but you have to fight mechs and soldiers on top of zombies. I would say get all three and then the last pack coming up, it's a real experience to finish them all up one by one with the easter eggs"
CodAW,3czkg8,Qais_tm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:13:00 2015 UTC,"The 3rd dlc pack "" Supremacy "" , which has the map carrier , it's by far the best , its fairly big and not too small , it's not hard to learn at all I learnt it all in the 3rd game , Lots of new guns , and there is the defusing bomb rounds which are fairly easy if u have the powerful guns , overall u will enjoy it the most by far .  As for the bird outfit , u get that from advanced supply drops , it isn't related to any dlc ."

CodAW,3cyu69,autowikibot,3,Sun Jul 12 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"Confirmation bias:       Confirmation bias, also called myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.   It is a type of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and illusory correlation (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).

CodAW,3cysxy,SyntheticEmerald,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:35:37 2015 UTC,It's possible that your friends have DLC 1 or atlas gorge. You can't join them because COD ditched the 'if this guy doesn't have the maps he'll get kicked from the lobby'. So let's say your friends lobby picks atlas gorge as the next map.. instead of kicking you COD has segregated you into your own group of people with DLC 2 and DLC 3. Best thing I can tell is either team up with him or buy all map packs. Hopefully that made sense.. I'm not good at explaining things
CodAW,3cysxy,igot6shots,0,Sun Jul 12 00:55:50 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Seems sloppy to me. Id rather the game just fill slots at this point. A disable dlc button works too right?

CodAW,3cwuz7,gorkye,2,Sat Jul 11 13:56:20 2015 UTC,Simply use a diff one. U prob don't have breakneck I'd reccomend the single stack.
CodAW,3cwuz7,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Sat Jul 11 14:56:40 2015 UTC,"Still, about the KF5 Spanner/Royalty.  If the only way to use it is with rapid fire, its better to just use the KF5 Sporter.  The same rate of fire with less recoil, better hipfire, same range and were you would put rapid fire you can now put another attachment.  The Spanner/Royalty is very weak overall.  If it had 720 RoF by default and the last +3 range gave another 15% range to the 4 shot kill range, then it would be the Peacekeeper of this game.   It would be a KF5 with 30% longer 4 shot kill range and 15% longer 5 shot kill range with 720 RoF. It would be a very solid weapon."
CodAW,3cwuz7,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"The better solution to buffing the spanner would be making +3 ranges 25% instead merely +20% and increasing the kf5 damage to 33-24-19. That way with advanced rifling you can kill in 4 shots with the spanner up to 1875 units if you get 2 headshots and 3 shot up to 800 units if you get one headshot.  Yes, it would still fire slow, but the range would keep it very competitive."
CodAW,3cwuz7,icedblackcoffee,2,Sun Jul 12 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"Advanced rifling is key. The range variations +adv rifling= 150% range after the first five bullets. That means you deal 33 damage up to 768 units instead of just 512 units. That's a fairly decent 4hk range that if you get one headshot or hit them with a stun becomes a 3hk.  I personally use autofocus (horizontal reticle), foregrip, and rifling. I'm almost always killing people in 3 or 4 bullets unless I go for longshots in which case the 5hk range w/rifling is 1800units so I'm always dropping people in no more than 5 bullets even at long range."
CodAW,3cwuz7,galaxie5OO,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:53:36 2015 UTC,Ok thanks guys I will probably go with the rapid fire advanced rifling and foregrip.
CodAW,3cwuz7,ScruffyScruffs,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:41:13 2015 UTC,"If you don't have the Single Stack, Breakneck, or Genuine, just use the base model.  I tried the spanner and it was horrible. Fires way too slow to be competitive. I'm sure someone can do well with it but it's not me."
CodAW,3cwuz7,42z3ro,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt bother with the Spanner, ive given up on it  use the Genuine or the Singlestack/Breakneck depending on if you want an AR/SMG styled version Genuine of the KF5, or a rapid firing SMG that SS/Breakneck are."

CodAW,3cwuz7,call_of_doge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:22:29 2015 UTC,The Spanner's range increase is way too small and its RoF decrease is way too big. The change in hip fire is negligible. Gun is absolute trash.

CodAW,3cwuz7,HaMx_Platypus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"The Spanner really is pretty good with Rapid Fire, Advanced Rifling and Foregrip.  I still don't have any of the top tier variants (Breakneck, Genuine, Single Stack), so that was my go-to KF5 setup for a while.  The problem is the Endless without Rapid Fire is better for two less class slots.  Smaller mag doesn't matter because you're reloading constantly for the damage bonus anyway.  The Spanner can definitely be made to work, perform well, but it's never going to be the best option."

CodAW,3cy5lh,Tenshi-01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Well either one could be possible to be honest. The way I see it is, that only GMP will be able to redeem items for credits. This would mean that he would be right on time to start using this feature, and if they were releasing more lvls then they probably wouldn't have come up with this system.   Maybe they had two ideas. One was more levels but a lot of people reacted kind of angry at that, and the other was the credit system which people will probably favor. Most that are at GMP wanted a way to earn ASD, that is one of the main reasons some wanted more levels, so if they get credits instead then they won't care about extra lvls or not."

Not possible, must be hacks.  A moment of nice twitch aim in one kill cam?  Gotta be an aimbot.  Guy barely breaks even next game?  Can't be that he's human and inconsistent or that he didn't have a team, just turned his shit off.  People are stupid.  That said, there are other issues with the game, and it was worse in the past.

CodAW,3cul4v,Lighttzout,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"The atlas 45 has become decent at close range, but honestly they need to do 3 things for the secondaries to be viable:   increase atlas 45 ammo to 15 increase mp443 grach ammo to 16 remove ads spread on the rw1 (while they are at it they should remove ads spread on the ae4 and epm3 as well) reduce the raise times for secondaries so that they swap decently fast even without fast hands   The fourth one is most important because I remember in cod4 how in the training mission they show you how fast your pistol swaps out. Fast hands should obviously still be useful, but at the same time swapping to a pistol should be closer to the speed it was in cod4."
CodAW,3cul4v,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:31:22 2015 UTC,I think fast hands is a retarded perk in the sense of swapping to pistols. I think pistols should swap out like in COD4.

CodAW,3cul4v,DPancoast,2,Sat Jul 11 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"The way it should work is without fast hands it should be close to cod4 speed and with fast hands it should be pretty much instantaneous.  Also, now that they buffed the secondaries, the following guns also should be buffed:   epm3: reduce the centerspeed by 250 (giving it moderate recoil), reduce the damage to 34-34-33, and add a 1.5 torso and neck multiplier (allowing for 2 body shot kills up to 1040 units). Make the exterminator 39-34-33 (1 headshot kills up to 650), -1 damage variants 34-34-24, and -2 damage variants 34-33-24. mk14: reduce the centerspeed by 200 (giving it low, but existent recoil), and increase the 1.1 chest and neck multi to a 1.5 torso and neck multi (allowing it to 2 body shot kill up to 650) m1 irons: change the damage and range to 75-52-34 at 250-800 (allowing for single headshot kills up to 5 meters and making it no more than 3 shots to kill)"

In waw you could put a scope on the garand and it turned into such. Mw3 had the dragonuv as its low recoil headshot only sniper after the patched it.  It's not a gimmick, it's how it has always been. The idea (not gimmick) is that you can easily follow up on the second shot and the first shot is high damage so if the enemy has taken a bullet of damage from someone else you can pick them off with one shot."

CodAW,3cvibx,The_Shreckoning,3,Sat Jul 11 06:13:00 2015 UTC,Bal melts things regardless of range.   Edit: downvote all you want... it's still true.
CodAW,3cvibx,smokinjoe65,-1,Sat Jul 11 11:59:34 2015 UTC,BAL is long range.
CodAW,3cvibx,EmotiveCDN,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:16:32 2015 UTC,Ok
CodAW,3cvibx,The_Shreckoning,-4,Sat Jul 11 06:18:09 2015 UTC,But the variety of weapons that you see on the kill feed isn't exactly representative of that. This would introduce some variety to what you see in the game.

CodAW,3cvibx,thejustice32,0,Sat Jul 11 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"How about they just nerf the Bal and Asm1 by increasing the recoil on the asm1 by 20% and increasing the recoil on the bal by 15%. And then rework the ARX by increasing its recoil slightly, changing its magazine size to 36, and changing the range to 900-1500.  Because let's be honest, the asm1 hasn't gotten any real nerf (intro firetime and magazine size barely did anything), the bal still needs more recoil (especially the obsidian steed), and the ARX currently has two range choices: underpowered and overpowered."

One great game with multiple flavors, like an Oreo cookie or Rocky Road ice cream.   XXX: players get 100 points for killing like in TDM, 50 points for confirming kills like KC, and points for capturing and holding objectives. Objectives run like Dom A and C, plus there is a moving Hardpoint objective worth 3x the Dom ones.  [Sidenote: the points should all be nerfed so that the game does not become score streak crazy.]"

Damage of 70, 1.5 multipliers in mentioned areas. Rpm of 300  I'm still waiting for the epm3 and mk14 to get reworked/buffed into the guns that they should be:   reduce the mk14 centerspeed by 200 (leading to low recoil, but existent recoil), and change the 1.1 chest and neck multi to a 1.5 torso and neck multi (1.534=51, 1.533 rounds down to 49.) reduce the epm3 centerspeed by 250 (leading to moderate recoil), change damage back to 34-34-33, and add a 1.5 torso and neck multi.

Me too. But don't get upset about the people complaining about poor servers, get upset at the people who chose to use inadequate servers. Maybe then, when the next installment is released, we won't have to listen to people bitch about servers because the people that make that decision will realize what's acceptable. This whole game is based on people interacting in an online environment where fractions of a second determine the playability of the game. That's the game they're selling, and if it's the game they're selling then they need to support it with servers that can provide that.  Edit: letter"

CodAW,3cshy2,iambrosafari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:38:38 2015 UTC,I used to party up with friends from a clan on a diff game when I started playing this game and found their locations made everything that much worse because we were so scattered around. From east coast to west coast. And then one guy who is stationed in Taiwan when we'd play with him everything got 10x worse. He was always 1 bar and complained every game ppl were lag switching him but meanwhile he's too dumb to consider he's across the damn world.
CodAW,3cshy2,BlazeDemBeatz,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:59:39 2015 UTC,In terms of lag though... I haven't had any issues with this in a long time. I feel like the lag was much worse in previous cod titles. Just my experience...

CodAW,3cshy2,ijustreally,5,Fri Jul 10 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"See, that is just not possible, because, if you read the patch notes, SH Games said this update included Connectivity Optimizations AND Matchmaking Improvements, so... Yeah, they wouldn't say that if is wasn't true, right?   Surely this must be a problem on YOUR end.  Maybe, if you clear your cache, uninstall and reinstall Atlas Gorge, all the DLCs, rub a chicken foot on your console, and sacrifice a lamb, you will no longer lag.   Seriously, Lag has been horrible throughout the life of the game.  Probably just your turn in the barrel!"

CodAW,3cshy2,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. From what I've seen, if there are no games found with a good host, the standards for a good host will be lowered drastically. While before the update I was finding 1-2 games on Supremacy, I will now first find 0 and then up to 13. These substandard games will result in 2-3 bars ping and hence your bullets might not register, or only after a second. But I guess it's better to play with a shit host than not finding games at all."

Why?"
CodAW,3cshy2,SoBeDragon0,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:21:00 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents... I seen absolutely no improvement in connectivity. Whatever that even means...I'm sick of being that guy who always has 4 bars when everyone else has 2... From what I understand the old logic before the lag comp was released into this game was 4 bars = u own like a god. Not the case because of getting lag comped. It feels like when it gets bad everyone has a huge advantage over me by being laggy, I see them late, I shoot locations where I see them but they aren't there anymore. They walk 6 ft in the hallway but I see them entering the door, yet they have the drop on my real location. People sometimes even seem to just appear out of thin air. I dunno But I know I'm not crazy. And yes I deserve to complain. I spent 450$ on a Xbox one, 60$ plus purchase the 15$ Dlc packs, 300$ for good cans so I can hear the details, a scuf controller that broke, a new controller and some of them dumb FPS freeks. And not to mention paying for fiber optic internet every month. So at over 1000$ invested to play video games I deserve for them to work correctly to the guy who thinks we don't deserve to complain!"

CodAW,3cshy2,v_force,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:19:33 2015 UTC,Terrible lag to the point where it is slow motion when playing it hurts my head trying to play. I leave the game. That also happened in the past but was rare. Since the update it has happened on 3 occasions.   I also get the odd bit of a lag out during games. Where I miss 1 second of action it seems to occur when in a gun battle. I go to shoot and I see a kill cam after a second of what appears to be a 'gap' in the gameplay. Or I lag and I see a kill cam and I get knifed by a guy who was running towards me but I was shooting him that kind of thing.

The real problem is that discussions like this take away from the real issue of the quality and playability of the game.  This one was better than Ghosts, but that's like saying 'I had a pinkie amputated rather than an index finger.'  AW and Ghosts spent so much time working on 'dress up your doll' shit that gameplay suffered.  Sadly, that waste of time was spent on a bunch of reskins, and even worse, renaming existing items and not changing the skins at all.    SHG thought that adding the exo movement was going to completely revamp gameplay and make their game something special.  Well, that basket of eggs got crushed.  Exos alone weren't enough and threw so many things out of balance that the game is one giant shitfest of lag, terrible spawns, glitches and bugs. All supported by a lying troll of a community manager who tries to act younger and more 'in-touch' than he is and just winds up coming off like a douche.  Amateur hour at its finest.  It looks like BO3 might actually exhibit the benefits of the 3-year dev cycle, but that remains to be seen.  Adding a third developer and yet another future shooter to the CoD mix has made the franchise stale, and it looks to be uninteresting going forward (outside of Treyarch actually being professionals and able to deliver the goods, which is why I have hope for BO3).  Feels like there is one year of interesting play left, and its not lazy artists or the community that laps up garbage microtransactions who are at fault.  /rant"

It's blatantly obvious they've given up any real meaningful game development that improves the game play. At this late in the release they are buffing the pistols?

CodAW,3co1k8,munch112000,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"From a previous post:   There's plenty of blame to go around. The real problem is that discussions like this take away from the real issue of the quality and playability of the game.  This one was better than Ghosts, but that's like saying 'I had a pinkie amputated rather than an index finger.' AW and Ghosts spent so much time working on 'dress up your doll' shit that gameplay suffered. Sadly, that waste of time was spent on a bunch of reskins, and even worse, renaming existing items and not changing the skins at all.  SHG thought that adding the exo movement was going to completely revamp gameplay and make their game something special. Well, that basket of eggs got crushed. Exos alone weren't enough and threw so many things out of balance that the game is one giant shitfest of lag, terrible spawns, glitches and bugs. All supported by a lying troll of a community manager who tries to act younger and more 'in-touch' than he is and just winds up coming off like a douche. Amateur hour at its finest.  It looks like BO3 might actually exhibit the benefits of the 3-year dev cycle, but that remains to be seen. Adding a third developer and yet another future shooter to the CoD mix has made the franchise stale, and it looks to be uninteresting going forward (outside of Treyarch actually being professionals and able to deliver the goods, which is why I have hope for BO3).  Feels like there is one year of interesting play left, and its not lazy artists or the community that laps up garbage microtransactions who are at fault.  /rant"

CodAW,3co1k8,maxhatcher,7,Thu Jul 9 20:33:02 2015 UTC,The problem with this reasoning is as a company they choose what to prioritize. They have decided that DLCs are a higher priority than fixing bugs. The proof is in their actions as a company in whole. This last patch is just more proof they are not going to fix anything large at this point. The key devs are probably on to the next game already and they have summer interns cutting their teeth on pistols to see if they are worthy of hiring after they graduate.

Shotgun: if you stay in the weapon max range (600-650 inches) they just melt (always OSK for the Tac-19 and for the bulldog and the S12 if 2 pellets hit).  LMG: Pretty much any of them is OSK at any range (except the XMG and the EM1 -1200 RPM compensates- which are 2SK). Other: M1 Irons and RW1 are always OSK but you must to have a good aim. MP-443 are 1 burst kill at any range, so it's usable. Also, every akimbo pistol works great. Another funny thing to point out is that the crossbow and MLD kill on impact.   All this is reffered to the base guns, result may change for (few) variants."

CodAW,3cpmdj,exoticstructures,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:00:42 2015 UTC,"Amr9 propipe is a 1hk until its third damage value. Only SMGs with further ohk range are the goliath and the mp11 royalty.  Mk14 is actually usable in Hc due to being a 1hk at any range  ARX damnation is the best ARX for hardcore due to the accuracy and 1hk range  Pain and suffering are the best sac3 variant for hardcore because they are still a 2hk at all ranges, but you can abuse the lack of recoil by crouching still and aiming for longshots.

Crossbow shoots way faster IDK about killing capabilities though as I can't find anyone else online and if I do I'm dead because they're using the OP guns and just generally being sweaty.  I got a hitmarker with my MORS pummeller (purpose aim to leg/foot as he was crouched on a fence) he moved as I shot so I possibly shot him through the wall but I doubt it.  Pistols seem normal.

My Atlas pistol is now retired which is worth keeping but the gear will it mix and match still over professional and enlisted for example to complete a set?

CodAW,3cnzgx,PrinceRkm,3,Thu Jul 9 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"Yes it is usable, but barely. It has a 4 shot kill minimum range, 32 bullets, and a fast rate of fire with horizontal recoil. Compare to the bal or asm1: 3 shot kill minimum range, 35 or 32 bullets, high rate of fire, easy to control vertical or almost no recoil. There is a reason nobody uses the sn6 competitively, because it is not a good gun. I could say that the combat knife is usable, because it works, but that doesnt make it useful in this game. If they could bring up the other guns to the level that the bal, asm1, and ameli are it wouldn't hurt anything, it would make the game more versatile."

CodAW,3cnzgx,PoisonStone,0,Thu Jul 9 13:29:23 2015 UTC,I believe the sniper update made it so the damage stat modifier now actually increases/ decreases damage because I've been using the MORS pummeller and have been getting a few hitmarkers. Mainly from no scopes and long range quick scopes across the map which probably hit in the keg or w/e. So I guess the doctor is now inferior as well. I dislike this sniper update but it would have made sense from the get go that the damage stat modifier would increase the damage overall and not just the guys ability to wallbang.  Like seriously the minus 3 damage on the Atlas 20mm Virtuosity did nothing... Except when you tried to shoot them through glass.
CodAW,3cnzgx,TheDangerousAnt,3,Thu Jul 9 13:36:13 2015 UTC,The update for the mors only changed the hit box detection on the upper arm area

CodAW,3cnzgx,Frogman360,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:30:33 2015 UTC,It clearly is not a one shot kill. The 1 shot kill areas on all MORS are the same. The damage increase is only reflected in 'wall' or object penetration. The hit box for a 1 shot kill is the same.   I will point out I did not read a comment here on the 1 shot and go and test it. I just wanted to play Skyrise with a sniper as I have not used one recently. And I was getting hit markers. So that's how I know after I installed the update and as you explained you can only play after the update is installed.   Don't run to the MORS its already OP in the right hands and if it was a 1 shot anywhere the game would be further broken.   Maybe he is playing one shot or something.

Can never match up to them in a gun fight even if I get straight shots on the opponent. The moment a bullet hits me I'm done. This sucks. Either you have attachments to make the base gun similar or you give the gun to everyone or maybe not allow the elite weapons in public lobbies. I don't know..just figure out a way for people to trade off the points if they r using elite weapons. Maybe have 2 wildcards if one uses an elite weapon?

CodAW,3cpb50,N9Nz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:01:25 2015 UTC,Wait. I opened an advanced supplythat I got at level 20. I got two retired items from it. Duplicate items to what I have.  When will I stop receiving retired items? I thought it was with immediate effect? But as it stand I can still get them and complete a set I have only one item missing on two sets.

CodAW,3cpb50,serothel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:10:15 2015 UTC,100% certain that it was earned after the patch. I open them all as I get them and this was a day after the update I had gone from one prestige to the next after the update.   So it was the ASD that I got at level 20 after the patch. I wasn't too happy that I got them and I didn't expect to so I'm now confused can I complete a set still? I need an exo for one and I think a shirt for the other.
CodAW,3cpb50,its_only_pauly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:54:56 2015 UTC,"Could be that it's exclusive to ASDs.

CodAW,3cpb50,serothel,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:59:46 2015 UTC,I'll report back for sure.   So the thinking is it was a glitch or they are only available to ASD's. But likely a glitch as they were 'retired' and therefore no longer obtainable.

Where I do find some the crappy stuff useful, is when I'm real close to prestiging (less than 5000-10000 points or so), I'll  trade in stuff I don't want, to get those points, so I don't waste any actual in-game XP going over the the prestige total."
CodAW,3cpb50,6_1_5,7,Thu Jul 9 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting strategy, but I do it the opposite way.  I like to save my useless items until after I prestige, then trade them in to get through the first 8-10 levels before even playing a round.  I do this because I'm only on prestige 6 or 7, so I don't have every single item I like permanently unlocked yet, and there are a few items that unlock in the really early rounds (like blast suppressor unlocking at level 2 or Streak module 1 unlocking at lvl 5).  So this way, once I prestige, I can immediately recreate all my weapon classes without having to play one or two of those rounds where you only have half your setup unlocked so you don't do as well  as normal and your K/D takes a hit.  Also, it takes me about 10-15 minutes to recreate all the classes again using this method; it would take a lot longer if I had to go back to each class after each round and add the new items I've just unlocked.  Just food for thought.  I've found this method provides a good amount of convenience."

I'm sure like most players, I've never used a prestige unlock to unlock the ASM, you get it at level 10.  So I am at Prestige Master level 7 and I don't understand for the life of me, why my classes can't remain in place with all the stuff I've unlocked when I prestige.  I would suggest, just take away the items I don't have."

CodAW,3cpg83,Outlandish_Rhubarb,2,Thu Jul 9 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"For me, core would be amazing if it weren't so damn noisy."
CodAW,3cpg83,CrHjEoVgEdLeLnE,2,Thu Jul 9 23:00:54 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% on Site 244 but I actually love Core. Can't describe it exactly, but the size of the map and availability of multiple flank routes really appeal to me. I feel like all standard maps in the game should have been the size of Core in order to minimize the spawn chaos and to let players think out routes when after they die."

CodAW,3cpg83,peterkozmd,3,Thu Jul 9 19:20:46 2015 UTC,Defender by a long shot
CodAW,3cpg83,Nic0205,8,Thu Jul 9 22:24:15 2015 UTC,Skyrise is definitely the worst.

CodAW,3cpg83,XxBeforeTimexX,2,Fri Jul 10 06:41:44 2015 UTC,Am i the minority for hating riot? I mainly play domination and the spawn traps are just too annoying. I rather like it for TDM though. I find that a lot of the maps just play better in certain game modes vs others

It's okay to have one or two of these on every map to let the snipers and LMG's do their thing, but when the whole map is nothing but them it becomes frustrating and ruins my play style."

CodAW,3cpg83,Allegiance10,0,Fri Jul 10 08:28:11 2015 UTC,"Instinct, Riot, Atlas George and Sideshow.  This is because I play HC Dom exclusively, and these are all of the biggest camping maps.  When done correctly, it is easy for any team to spawn kill the opponents on these levels and keep them locked into one side of the map.  These matches always end up with the leader being under 5000 points, which anything under 8000-9000 is a slow, drawn out lame match.  I hate these levels with a passion, and I would support exiling the creators to a very dark place on Earth for the rest of their lives."

My guess as to when the rest of the content will be released is either during the BO3 Beta or a week before/on the day of the launch of BO3. I think We all know Sledgehammer knows not many people are playing, so someone decided that pumping out more clothing would give TmarTn the need to read CharlieIntel and more tweets to us and to generate a bit of excitement towards AW before it dies off. Personally I like AW more than Ghosts, despite their flaws, and wish AW was in better hands than the ""PEOPLE ARENT PLAYING HINT AT LEGENDARY GUNS AND MAKE NEW CLOTHING TO DISTRACT THEM FROM THE MAJOR FLAWS"" that is SHG.

CodAW,3cn4wz,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:52:01 2015 UTC,I honestly think the XMG is the most melty gun in the game. You just have to sacrifice mobility for that high damage and fire rate.
CodAW,3cn4wz,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:20:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I would use Venus and Mars with rapid fire. Find a long line of site and lock it down. 4 bullet kills at any range. But also figuring it's shooting 2 bullets at a time. So really like 2 bullet kill at any range.  As soon as I'd wave it over someone they instantly died. It's def a fun and good gun if u know what your doing. I was calling it the walking turret.
CodAW,3cn4wz,famoussasjohn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:48:16 2015 UTC,It grew on me. Throw on Rapidfire on the Bacon & Eggs variant. Playing Momentum worked great for me. Just have the EPM3 left which is a pain due to the damn flare it gives off every shot. :( Hipfire shots with an LMG are just dumb for the challenges.
CodAW,3cn4wz,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:38:51 2015 UTC,I found the epm3 is really good for hipfiring. It has a decent range. Do yourself a favor and do this gun only in HC. It's 1hk so you can play a map like Detroit and just slam ppl down with the hip fires.
CodAW,3cn4wz,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"Try going prone for those hipfire kills, and use a variant with increased handling if possible. You could also go in hardcore and use a rushing class with lightweight, gung ho, overclock, and laser sight when applicable. Just run around and spam it when you see an enemy. And I just remembered punching someone while holding it counts as a hipfire unless they've patched that recently."
CodAW,3cn4wz,LackingAGoodName,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"It was manageable, but for my LMG's, I prefer a more traditional version like the ameli or the pytaek, tbh."
CodAW,3cn4wz,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Fri Jul 10 04:08:50 2015 UTC,"Really? I actually realllllllyyy enjoyed getting Diamond on the XMG's! I started with the hardest (EPM3) first, then the Ameli, next the Pytaek, after that I went for the XMG's, and finally the EM1 last."
CodAW,3cn4wz,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:39:06 2015 UTC,"I did the ohm first (natrual so gameplay wasn't trying, don't need for royalty but the unending looks cool as shit in diamond) then the pyatak ( same thing it just happened) so I was like screw it do the rest. Then I did the ameli, em1, epm3 then saved xmg thinking it was gonna be the hardest, which was easiest because of lockdown being so accurate at long range. Epm3 wind up being the hardest and worst KDR. Em1 was tough for longshots (in core). It's recoil and no melt stats at long range are bad. Everything else was a breeze. I've done ARs, SMG and Heavy. Next is shotguns. I've had the s12 sitting forever with nothing left but 9 dog fights. This just seems hopeless."
CodAW,3cn4wz,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:57:28 2015 UTC,"Go in uplink, use Exo Hover, laser sight, and advanced rifling. Overcharged can help if you have room for it in your loadout. Camp in front of your goal and whenever the satellite carrier comes close, jump, hover, wait for them to jump and blast them. Or go in hardcore and hover near places where people jump a lot, the roofs on Riot, Terrace B Dom, etc. Recovery is full of great spots for dogfights too."
CodAW,3cn4wz,Disc_Hunt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I'm pretty good at getting dog fights but only with guns I don't need them on when I'm not looking for them lol. I'll accidentally get 3 a match with a asm1 or bal. but if I set out to get them is when it's a pain in the butt. ""Jonny your trying too hard"" syndrome."
CodAW,3cn4wz,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"The thing that sucks about dogfights is they are out of your control to a degree. You can't make an enemy jump, and it's guaranteed when you're going for dogfights and skeet shooters you'll get lobbies where no one jumps. Then when you're going for headshots everybody wants to be Hoppy McJumpsalot."
CodAW,3cn4wz,BJGreenDream,2,Fri Jul 10 03:18:30 2015 UTC,Heavy is super easy I sat down for not even a week to complete it. Xmg was fun. Lockdown mode ftw. Epm3 was the worst.

CodAW,3clglj,Disc_Hunt,2,Thu Jul 9 05:48:23 2015 UTC,"Who cares if it's frowned upon? I love using a Mors and Tac-19, so many one hit kills. The people that frown upon it are probably mindlessly attacking you the same way and dying over and over again. It's easy enough to take me out with any weapon when using that combo but you have to play strategically. You don't even have to switch classes to counter it, just attack me differently. However, rage often causes people to disregard logic. I know I can be guilty of doing the same thing going for that revenge kill. It's probably my biggest weakness but I've gotten a lot better with it."

But the complaints just kept coming. To be honest though, I also hate it when other players use the S12. There is something about just dying suddenly without a fighting chance that feels so wrong. I dont mind being killed by an ASM1, Hole Puncher, or BAL. At least it took some aiming, and I had a window, albeit a small one, to escape before dying. Not so much with S12."

I stay away from all lethal streaks, but the  assault drone is OK if you fly it yourself and you're really careful, although I hate to ever be ""off my gun.""  I like the UAV, no attachments so I can get it quicker and more often (I'd rather have some map awareness often, than great map awareness less often) and System Hack with extra time.  I will also, often use a couple of threat grenades. Whatever you decide, please don't use the bombing run."
CodAW,3conjl,6_1_5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:36:37 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if I've ever had a teammate open a black trap.  Why do you like the system hack?  Do enough people not use hardwired to make it useful?  Would it be more useful than just about 2 guaranteed kills at an objective (from missile strike or XS1 vulcan)?  Yes bombing run is worthless in HC.  I was trying to mess around with the math and figure what would come out to easily obtained score patterns.  Like 1 cap 1 kill = scorestreak cost.  that may be too much headache to mess with with all the little things like assists that are worth points.
CodAW,3conjl,6_1_5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people prefer hardline and/or blast suppressor.

CodAW,3conjl,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:33:57 2015 UTC,One reason system back is really good is for the assist points module. With it being slightly cheaper than the top tier streaks like bombing run and warbird as soon as you set the system hack off you need barely any points for your next streak. So as long as u can manage not to die you can chain those assist points to the bigger score streak without lifting a finger.

Support threat detection UAV with assist point boost, system hack with disable ex is and additional assist points, and warbird with extra time. All are easy to get, especially the support threat detection UAV because you'll earn one every minute or two if you play the OBJ.   This allows you constantly know where the enemy is at, keep them from being super mobile with no Exo movements and not being able to call in their streaks. Finally, being able to have map control through the warbird. This set up synergizes well with any non-campy playstyle and gets even more effective if you are playing with people running the same thing."

CodAW,3ckaoh,kekeagain,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:36:29 2015 UTC,I like to think of the Insanity as the original BAL before it was nerfed.  It's damn great at all ranges to the point where it feels OP.  You just have to get used to the sights which to me is no biggie since I always use the ironsights.  My brother has the Insanity and Obsidian Steed and prefers the Insanity just because it kills very fast up close whereas the Obsidian Steed often feels like a coin toss in close quarter combat just because it shoots slower.

CodAW,3ckaoh,pallyftw,7,Thu Jul 9 21:25:31 2015 UTC,"I like the idea and where you're going with it, but as some other posters have mentioned.. people would focus on getting one specific gun and leave the rest alone.   The solution would have to be a sort of roulette, for example, lets say you hit 300 kills with a particular weapon.. You get 3 Variant cards that are face down on your screen and you get to pick one.   At first they could all be Enlisted, and then as you progress further into the kills with that weapon you'd start to see Professional variants, and finally Elites. Any guns that weren't selected would be recycled into the selection process. So eventually you'd get all the guns by getting enough kills.   A way to monetize this feature would be to allow players to see what cards are which to pick the best one, instead of having to wait til the next checkpoint in kills to try again."
CodAW,3ckaoh,Pizza2kbitchslut,4,Wed Jul 8 19:22:35 2015 UTC,"I love this idea, however, I disagree with the way of monetization.

CodAW,3ckaoh,Unicornography,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"Well the problem people have with variants is that they are random. This eliminates randomness because you earn the specific gun by using that gun.

CodAW,3ckaoh,kagallagher,9,Wed Jul 8 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"Exo-suits aren't the problem. The maps are. Next time around the map design team needs to remember three things:   Larger maps (to account for the speed of the exo suits) Limit verticality, to limit deaths occurring from outside the player's field of view Enforce lanes (don't make lanes the player can simply jump over)   Do this, and the flow of the game will be massively improved."
CodAW,3ckaoh,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Wed Jul 8 18:31:20 2015 UTC,Also limit the fucking line of sights. I don't like getting sniped with an assault rifle from halfway across the map when I SPAWN. (Parliament...) Also fix the effing netcode.
CodAW,3ckaoh,Pizza2kbitchslut,2,Thu Jul 9 05:29:14 2015 UTC,"and get rid of the side to side bursting shit. You should be able to jump up to get to ledges and on buildings. If everyone is flying around the map sideways and shit we all just end up using high ROF guns and spraying each other.  I do agree that the lanes are very, very important though. Last game to have proper maps was Black Ops 2"
CodAW,3ckaoh,SunnyTelight,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:27:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see a huge problem with Map design maybe because I've got used to it but I think the main problem is the swift movement of the exo contributes to a lot of the lag whereas a player can be 20 ft away from where u actually see them within a split second so add in the lag comp and ur shooting what u precieve as their actual location but it's really not where they are, so u die and they live in these situations."
CodAW,3ckaoh,pig_master,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yah that's the main problem with the exo's, they are literally too quick for the connection to keep up.

CodAW,3ckaoh,Johtoboy,0,Thu Jul 9 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with all your points but I think the exo-suits still need tweaking. They are just too chaotic in their current state. For instance the jumping, someone shouldn't be able to jump high in the air and then instantly boost down in any direction. If you jump you should be vulnerable and your landing should be predictable."
CodAW,3ckaoh,reDKing101,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:17:07 2015 UTC,"I may have an unpopular opinion, but I think if you are jumping you shouldn't be able to ADS."
CodAW,3ckaoh,Derpy_Bird,0,Thu Jul 9 13:42:21 2015 UTC,"Tweaks could definitely be made, for one making the boosts slower, and possibly turning exo-slide into a perk. Sometimes I wish this game had a perk system like Ghosts, default all you get is the ability to double jump, then 1 point perks for slide and dodge. A 2 point perk for the ability to shoot / better accuracy when in the air. So you could still do everything you can in Advanced Warfare, but it's a sacrifice and something you have to build your class around. Just giving all these exo movements to everyone for free isn't the best idea, because they benefit certain weapon types more than others (Shotgun/SMGs vs. LMGs)."

CodAW,3ckaoh,FuXs-,3,Wed Jul 8 17:37:55 2015 UTC,Can I ask why you think the Exo suit is bad for the game?
CodAW,3ckaoh,kagallagher,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"I am going to preface my statement by saying this: I understand this is Advanced Warfare. Things in this game are supposed to be futuristic and advanced. That is the point, and I understand that.    That being said, there is no survivability in the game. You cannot keep distance between you and your opponents and map location has little to no significance. It takes a while to get from one place to another in other call of duty games and that is okay. Either the maps need to get bigger, or the mobility needs to be changed. I shouldn't be able to get from one side of the map to the other within 10 seconds.   Call me a camper, but I enjoy getting a good kill streak and I try to strategically position myself so I have all my flanks covered and I am aware where the enemy team is located on the map using team communication. In AW, the other team could spawn on the other side of the map but be flying through the air and all of a sudden they are right next to you within 5 seconds. I agree with u/FuXs-, there is chaos in this game. In older call of duty games, unskilled players had a hard time killing a skilled player, in this game, there is no way to protect yourself from all directions and therefore there is no survivability.   All of this being said, I am excited for Black Ops 3 because the ""jumping"" looks like it is pretty exclusively used for getting up on ledges or into windows, not bursting yourself around the map or dashing side to side like a halo jumper."
CodAW,3ckaoh,FuXs-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:23:56 2015 UTC,"Dont get your hopes up too high for ground based gunfights. From what I have seen, jumping in Gunfights will be key again. This time though, you cant just boost out of sight. Jumping will be used to mess up your aim."
CodAW,3ckaoh,tgr31,0,Wed Jul 8 19:29:16 2015 UTC,I think I can get used to a little bit of jumping and vertical gameplay. Destiny has helped with that since I haven't been playing AW. It's the sideways and back and forth boosting that I don't like. You shouldn't be able to just electric slide 50 feet to the left or right on the ground or in mid air.
CodAW,3ckaoh,FuXs-,-3,Wed Jul 8 19:32:48 2015 UTC,Because it creates chaos and randomness and therefor eliminates any sort of Skillgap so that even the worst players can kill you. At least that is what everyone is telling me. Apparently it is a lot more skillfull to aim around every corner and stick to your headglitch spots while not worrying about getting flanked or being shot from above.
CodAW,3ckaoh,NSFW895,5,Wed Jul 8 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"Much more skillfull to sit on a 30 foot ledge or roof and wait, you were right"
CodAW,3ckaoh,thelivingdead44,-2,Wed Jul 8 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah everyone hated those windowcampers on Nuketwon, agree."
CodAW,3ckaoh,NSFW895,5,Wed Jul 8 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"Uhm, no. It takes a lot of skill to be really good in AW. Maybe you just aren't used to it yet, maybe you need to practice more. I got better by going local player offline with bots on high difficulty. Since bots seem to have some type of premonition of where you are going to be, it makes the difficulty that much more hard, and makes you think and strategize."
CodAW,3ckaoh,TheNickster99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed,AW has much more disparity in skill than the older CODs and it's way more fun because of it. If someone just sees you then you have so many options to come out on top and so do they rather than just the dropshot or jump shot before."
CodAW,3ckaoh,ScumBrad,2,Wed Jul 8 21:16:05 2015 UTC,"Yes. I think AW opened my eyes to how much you can avoid dying now. Before if I was getting shot, you could try and move out the way but it is too slow now I can boost to the side and go around and get them back quickly. Going vertical for shooters is the best thing about next Gen games."
CodAW,3ckaoh,thelivingdead44,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:06:23 2015 UTC,I'm finding it that the terrible netcode and gun balancing in this game really makes skill pointless. My accuracy can be great and I can use a base HBra3 but because of that guy with terrible accuracy using an Obi Steed he can melt me before I can even find out that he's hitting me. The game requires no skill.
CodAW,3ckaoh,uncircled_swag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"Variants are definitely a bigger issue with the game than exo suits are.  If you have good aim, you will be able to win most of your gun fights even if the enemy is boosting around.  Purposely unbalanced guns are something that should never be in any shooter though.  That being said, the game does require skill.  Can you imagine if AW was your first CoD game ever?  If you make a new account from scratch you will be able to play a few games with the really new and bad players and you will understand that with weapon balance, AW would have had the biggest skill gap in a CoD game ever."

CodAW,3ckaoh,DPancoast,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:45:39 2015 UTC,This would work for me.   But it doesn't work for noobier players. It would take them longer to get the kills.  Also people would just stick to the OP guns and the more important thing in all this would be that there would be no sales in supply drops. Why change a model that makes money?
CodAW,3ckaoh,Tsm_sin_420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:52:13 2015 UTC,Advanced Supply Drop could just be things like the royalty weapons that way you could still get the variant fair and square but if you want to get a variant with a different type of camouflage and more rare then you can spend that money
CodAW,3ckaoh,xworfx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:57:49 2015 UTC,I'm not disagreeing with you.  I'm playing devil's advocate and this would not make money it would not be a strategic move.  Not many people would bother with purchases. The way things are now you see people with a gun you believe it would make you better at the game.  So you   a) Play more in the thought that it will come eventually - (Many people gave up on the game) b) Buy an advanced supply drop thinking if you have a chance to open multiple and therefore increase the likelihood of getting the gun you dream of having.   Changing this system to the one you mention would make people probably recall the BS they put up with in this game and decide to not spend any money on micro transactions.

Also, you get to pick which game mode you play.  I would think that if you just wanted kills, you'd probably stick to TDM or maybe KC.  Then you could get your kills AND play the objective."
CodAW,3ckaoh,milwaukeenic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:04:19 2015 UTC,"Based on recent gaming trends, I can only assume that the RNG aspect of weapon acquisition was done purposefully to a) monetize the game even further (ASDs) and b) make it more palatable / ""accessible"" for casual players.  Look at Activision's current stable of games: Destiny (RNG loot), CoD AW (RNG loot), Skylanders (buy figurines), and Hearthstone (RNG loot).   It's been near-proven that AW uses a weighted distribution system for handing out Elites. Myself and many other players on this subreddit have talked about receiving endless numbers of the Ameli / Pytaek / AMR9, whereas many casual or low KD players have the Obsidian Steed, Insanity, and Speakeasy.   This system was intentional and probably will not change. CoD's sales numbers go down, so they introduce more micro-DLC options."

So, for one game in AW, it processed 7.5MBs. This game was aproximately 8 minutes. So a MB a minute? This was on Xbox one. So, you figure, if you get 10 games an hour (75MB) with playing 8 hours a day, it's 600MB. Probably looking at 18GB max for one person per month if you're a really dedicated player.  I also read somewhere you have data caps from your ISP. Yuck! A little side note, we cancelled TV service and exclusivly have internet and phone service. We use Hulu/Netflix/Amazon Prime. I think our average is 500GB a month. Our highest this year was 700GB. I'm trying to break the 1TB border! We also have 3 xbox ones, 4 PCs, 4 iPods, 2 iPhones, and 2 iPads. Someone is using the internet some how at any given time. I even stream music for our doggie while we are away from home. Now, mind you, we don't really torrent stuff, so this is mainly from streaming music/videos and downloading games.

CodAW,3cnwio,s0meMurk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:15:13 2015 UTC,How would you play like that? Would you use the AR for medium/long range and then when you're moving switch to a shotgun?
CodAW,3cnwio,x-isle,2,Thu Jul 9 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of it would have to do with map knowledge and play style. If you know you are about to enter a more closed off section of the map, pull out the shotty.   Playing greenband? unless you plan on sticking to the high areas be prepared for a lot of close quarters.   Defender? AR for the outside areas. Shotty/smg for the inside.  Also, knowing your limits is a good idea... if you have a shotgun and no AR, hug the corners and stay away from areas that could put you in a long range conflict.  HTH"

CodAW,3cnwio,MufasaAP,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:32:25 2015 UTC,If you play a variety of guns it will help you get better. Obviously for a sub the best option is going to be the asm1 but you can also use the KF5 and can do just fine. Also when you run AR's its recommended you use stock on any AR so you have the mobility of an SMG when you aim down your sights. Good luck!
CodAW,3cnwio,MufasaAP,0,Thu Jul 9 11:59:40 2015 UTC,Thanks. Yeah my other vice is that I always use 3 attachments with the ARs which means 1 semtex and no score streaks

CodAW,3cnwio,Allegiance10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:32:59 2015 UTC,"Weapon choice is all about playstyle. Advanced players use a wide variety of weapons, from SMGs to snipers. You may or may not have more fun and success with other weapons, it's hard to say until you try. If you're a run and gunner you probably will do better with SMGs. If you prefer longer range engagements and map control try the Ameli, or maybe Pytaek.  It's important to switch up your playstyle to suit the weapon. One of the most fun aspects of going for weapon mastery was trying different playstyles and finding out how good some of the less popular weapons were. I actually went on my best streak ever (23) with the SN6 and I had just started to play with it to complete camo challenges. I got a 19 streak somehow with the MDL when going for camos with that. If you ask me those games are more memorable than the ones where I have a k/d like 40/6.  If you say you do fairly well with ARs but are always smoked by ASM1 then I think you might have more of a hybrid close/medium range style, in which case the SN6 might be best for you. If you have the KF5 Spanner it works great in this hybrid role, foregrip helps a lot. The ASM1 Magnitude is also great for this playstyle and is easy to acquire, just get 300 kills with the ASM1."

They're shamelessly pumping out new pieces of reskinned cosmetics to sell their scammy ASDs without even acknowledging some of the big issues that the game has. It's an insult and that is why people are quick to complain when new ASD-exclusive shit is announced.  So no, nobody wants artists to be working on fixes. They want somebody to work on fixes and to show us some respect as customers. The Retreat out-of-map exploit was in the game for months before they finally fixed one of the entrance points. I still can't get the attachment mastery challenge because the sight challenges reset every prestige. The menus are still extremely laggy. Somebody is not doing their job. The artists doing their thing, applying new textures to existing models, have nothing to do with it. That money-grubbing bullshit is just adding insult to injury.  It's hard to accept the ""common sense"" rationalization of ""Oh, they're two teams doing two different things. Cut them some slack."" when the most important team is doing jack shit to fix the issues that we've known about for months. Stop the apologist act. Contrary to what you may want to believe, you're not the only person who knows that artist and development teams are separate. That doesn't change anything.

If I had access to SHG studios, I could go in there and fix the Dynamo bug, Ak12 hair trigger bug, and buff/nerf any gun in less than 15 minutes. They are a company, who's main goal is to make profit; not to ensure that everyone is happy with their game. It is obvious with the monetization of advanced supply drops, and the exclusive gear that comes in them. They pump those out all the time, but it takes them almost a year to do weapon balances? when they supposedly had 3 years of optimal game designing, there should be very minimal glitches and balancing issues.

CodAW,3cl0wl,CrownThePedro,2,Wed Jul 8 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"I've wanted it but never requested it publicly.  The games ended too quick every time in TDM before the limit was raised.  It'd often end before the second half of Recovery opened, not that I cared for that portion of the map but it just shows how quick the games were compared to other game modes.  I'm glad that they raised the limit to 100.  The only downside to it is when the other team keeps backing out except for that one guy who wants to play hide and seek and so the game drags on forever, but that's a price I'm willing to pay."
CodAW,3cl0wl,kekeagain,2,Wed Jul 8 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"I've found this to be a little strange in my experience.  Maybe it's just me, but I find that (assuming equal play between game modes) I play more games of Kill Confirmed in which a team hits the limit (85) then I play games of TDM that reach 100 (or even 85).  Being that KC is essentially TDM but with an extra step added, you'd think KC scoring would be lower than TDM since it takes more effort to score.  Just something I've noticed."

CodAW,3cg2dg,famoussasjohn,3,Tue Jul 7 18:27:05 2015 UTC,"Limited time more than likely. Just like Comeback 24/7  It means various game modes strictly on this map. Rounds of course end just like standard matches. Instead of voting for other maps, you'll be able to vote for the same map, but different game mode.  Well..if you want to on Twitch you can.  It was good on MW2. It's the same thing just with Exos this time around. It's still fun IMO."

One clam member did not have room at the time to install the full dlc which he had. So he installed one map pack and atlas gorge. He could just about find a TDM game after a 5-8 minute wait.  The only way he could play was to invite someone with no DLC to his party or join them in a game. He was then stuck playing no DLC maps.

Don't ever peek, or give chase. When challenging a position, if you notice you miss your shots and your opponent has reacted to it, move location. If you attempted to challenge a position, lost, and are now on the brink of death, don't let your ego take over. Your opponent has the advantage if you peek, and you're only 1 bullet away from death. Almost always a losing battle. Use your scorestreaks as a means of distraction. If you're in a poor position and find yourself surrounded, use your system hack. They'll always retreat during the initial shock, giving you time to rush an opponent or move locations. I'll also use the warbird to force opponents into predictable areas (hallways/rooms). Threat detection is an invaluable tool for situational awareness. Refrain from unnecessary movement, such as exoing all the time."

You'll have a bad time most of the time because the passive strategies outlined in this thread are often slow strategies as well. Eventually, you'll have to drop the passiveness and be more aggressive if you want to get the streak. Also, even if you are being passive, it would still behoove you to know where enemies spawn and generally how spawns work in CoD. Anyway, we can give you all the advice in the world, but you'll get a DNA when you get one of those sweet YouTube lobbies."

CodAW,3ci8tl,sonichu1488,11,Wed Jul 8 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"Exo Survival was just something they threw in just to have something be a prelude to the Zombie Mode you had to buy. This game seems to be worst in the series for ""buying extra fun"" as far as I can tell. At least Ghosts gave you Survival and a free Extinction map with the game (Which I had fun with a bunch until I finally beat it 4-5 times). This game didn't even provide you with 1 gun camo that looks decent / colorful. Every gun camo worth having is micro DLC and 90% of all clothing looks terrible, except for the micro DLC Advanced Supply Drop items that almost all of them look pretty cool / colorful. I'm honestly surprised they haven't come out with a bunch of micro DLC weapons at this point or Advance Supply Drop only variants."
CodAW,3ci8tl,Halloween3,4,Wed Jul 8 03:20:05 2015 UTC,"The game isn't bad, I love what they were going with. It's just that there is something unfinished or you see some bad design choice around some corners and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I wish they would spend less time making pay to get recolors or banning confederate flags and fix what is wrong with their game so it deserves it's rightful place in the COD library.  I will give them credit tho, they removed the atlas gorge 24/7 playlist that nobody played after the first week. And it only took them like 7 months to do it."
CodAW,3ci8tl,Halloween3,2,Wed Jul 8 03:30:10 2015 UTC,I played Exo Survival a lot in the first few months of the game because the connection was so bad  for me I couldn't win a gunfight shooting first ever. It was insane to play actually lol. I did all the Exo Survival stuff for the HBR variant and the Zombie stuff though. The game was just a little too easy to me and not very satisfying. I flipped Detroit almost 3 times solo like the 10th time I ever played the game. I would also flip any map 4+ times playing with 3 other people and could have kept going but I would just get completely bored. I used the class that had the UAV that you could level up to see the enemies through the walls. After a while I decided to try the class with the Goliath killstreak because I don't think it could double jump but that was also very easy to use because the Goliath gave you an extra life to use like every other round lol.  Edit: Also I really like playing Survival in MW3. It was fun because to unlock Sleight of Hand you had to be max level I think. The game was fun enough to keep playing until I got there and than fun after seeing how far I could go. The only thing that would have made it amazing would have been the ability to play with 4 people. It was only 2 max.
CodAW,3ci8tl,tyzenberg,5,Wed Jul 8 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think exo survival got the love SHG was expecting.  My coworker loves survival.  He was near the top of the leaderboards in MW3 and I'm pretty sure he was near the top for this game as well.   But even for him, the game mode got stale, I think SHG is giving up on survival."
CodAW,3ci8tl,Pae_PC,5,Wed Jul 8 03:03:01 2015 UTC,"Like I said, all it needs is a major update and the ability to earn exp. It should be it's own thing and not just a side mode to earn all the zombie pieces. So much potential is getting wasted. At least let me play the damn maps I already own if you don't care."
CodAW,3ci8tl,FlowingSilver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. For me, I never find any ""major"" update from SHG at all. All of their update is to increase or decrease some stats of the guns that players think it's OP then some other guns become OP instead, then they change it again . . and again, and that's how they call it major update."

CodAW,3ci8tl,ozarkslam21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"there was only one trailer about it, because the trailer got dumped on majorly by the community as they hyped up the reveal as it was going to be a whole new mode, and then when it was lame ass survival the pitchforks and torches came out.  It was their own fault for trying to pimp this ""brand new co-op mode"" and then announce it's just the same as mw3 survival but everyone is wearing jetpacks.  PR nightmare, and I can't believe they even did it."
CodAW,3ci8tl,Pae_PC,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"im sure a few people like survival, but the overwhelming disappointment in the reveal of exo-survival was telling that the masses just don't like it.  They wanted a different mode, and so SHG frantically went to work on zombies.  Survival was a really lazy attempt at a co-op mode anyway.  What more would you want from it?  besides more maps it doesn't seem like there is anything else to add  to answer your question, no i don't play survival, and the few times i did play it were only to open the zombie gear and nothing more. I didn't find it the least bit fun, nor did i find it fun in MW3"

CodAW,3ckfq6,Murphy-115,6,Wed Jul 8 16:36:52 2015 UTC,I personally disagree. I feel like I'm constantly being shot in the back because theres no separation in the middle of the map. Every lane can be jumped over which causes shit gameplay.
CodAW,3ckfq6,Usernamesarehard7,3,Wed Jul 8 19:39:20 2015 UTC,"Guess it's down to how you like your FPSs. Some enjoy the slower and more tactical movement and some prefer flying all over the place.

CodAW,3ckfq6,convery,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I'm still not 100% on how I feel about the boost jumping, whilst I don't prefer it to the normal standard COD movement I don't necessarily hate it as some have. Yet I still feel like I prefer the map in this game, think I just prefer the fact that too many used to mess around in games trying to get to those spots and failing constantly, leaving the teams more like 3v6 and I like the change in that theirs no such thing as an advantageous spot on the map, its all level playing ground."

I had a hunch that it would annoy me when so many of the comments prior to its release were about how easy and cool it will be to sit up on the roof. Well, they weren't lying. It seems like everybody I play with is always trying to either get up there or out on those floating bars. It's just not my idea of a good time.  The unfortunate thing about it is that people won't stop doing it. At least when the maps are new and everybody is camping, it usually gets better over time. I don't see that happening on this map since, apparently, the best thing about it is being able to easily get up on God spots. That is just boring.  I'll just continue avoiding this map because nothing about it has made me think that it's actually fun. The way people play it makes me want to pull out my hair."

CodAW,3ckfq6,TheNickster99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:25:06 2015 UTC,The new DLCs seem to support camping even more. Skyrise is all about camping. Kremlin has people camping at the stairs or at the tower windows. Seems like that is how they are designed to be played. I too have run into lots of campers while playing the Supremacy DLC.

CodAW,3clxn5,glenkrit,2,Thu Jul 9 00:44:28 2015 UTC,The worst part of all this is... is that Activision still has the gall to charge $60.00 for the 360 and PS3 versions of BO3. Granted we know it's just a watered down port...but slapping the same price as that of the next gen versions! It's a new low.
CodAW,3clxn5,Frogman360,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:48:36 2015 UTC,to be fair its not really Activision's decision to do that. I'm almost certain that there are much more important higher-ups that are essentially forced to follow industry standards.
CodAW,3clxn5,JdoesDDR,3,Thu Jul 9 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"Its not like SHG can just take their design team and have them start fixing bugs and crashes.  The dev team works on the bugs, the design team works on the new gear sets.  SHG is in no way prioritizing new gear over fixing glitches and bugs."
CodAW,3clxn5,JdoesDDR,2,Thu Jul 9 02:08:53 2015 UTC,The people who create the new gear sets are not the same people who are in charge of fixing glitches.  More people need to realize this.
CodAW,3cg5cm,TheWhiteTestament,12,Tue Jul 7 17:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited (not quite TMARTN levels, but getting there) about the PDW and Crossbow.  The PDW akimbo is pretty powerful right now, but I've always been a fan of full auto pistols.  Crossbow was just absolutely wank to begin with, so whatever buff they bring should help it at least somewhat."
CodAW,3cg5cm,proteins247,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"PDW akimbo especially with the condensed and extendos is almost OP. It's as powerful as a primary weapon, i.e. comparable with the SAC3s. I'm not sure if the PDW needs much tuning.  MP443 Grach however, needs help. More ammo, more damage, more accuracy, more buffs.  Atlas 45, hmm 12, 14, 16 bullet magazine?  Crossbow, idk how they can tune that thing. They could increase the blast radius and damage, but that won't help with hitting targets.  MORS. I think it's currently fine. Perhaps a bit less sway and a true +2 firerate for The Doctor variant. I think expanding the 1HK kill area would make the Atlas even less popular, which is not desirable. More people use the MORS right now anyway.  It'd be cool if they all-around reduced ADS time for snipers by a few hunder ms."
CodAW,3cg5cm,TheNickster99,-2,Wed Jul 8 02:47:47 2015 UTC,"REDUCE ADS time?! Fuck no, I don't want more shitty quickscopers ruining the game. They need to nerf toughness on sniper rifles if anything.

CodAW,3cg5cm,dhansen4204,3,Tue Jul 7 17:57:21 2015 UTC,What buff does the mp11 need though? I would much rather see a sn6 buff
CodAW,3cg5cm,amerikanviking,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:11:23 2015 UTC,"I have the Goliath so technically I'm happy with it. The base variant of the MP11 is terrible. Just doesn't seem to do anything good. It doesn't compete. The Goliath is such an amazing buff.  Edit: I would love an SN6 buff as well. I would like to use it. Tried using it in the past and it seemed like a hit marker machine. I mean, why not buff both?"
CodAW,3cg5cm,dhansen4204,2,Wed Jul 8 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"Oh okay all I use of the mp11 was the Goliath I guess that's why it seemed balanced I haven't used the stock version. Also for the sn6 instead of a better fire rate I thing it should get a mag size to 40, a slight 3 damage kill range (basically shotgun range), and change it to max 5 hit kill. Then in my opinion it is viable especially the third can be a 3-4 hit kill with +2 range to the 3 hit kill makes it a great weapon even with slowish fire rate. Kind of like the Mtar from Cod Ghosts"

Atlas 45 should act more like the Tac45(it's a.45, should be more powerful than a .44 magnum), Mp443 should be a bit more powerful or fire 3 bullets in  burst, and PDW should do more damage/less kick. As for mors, it is perfect the way it is, unless they increase damage to always get one shot kills, I don't see what they can do"

I tried every variant I own for this, including the two Elites and the ""Shorty"", and they all are absolutely terrible.  In Black Ops 2 and Ghosts, ALL weapons were viable.  Period.  If I had a 2.0 K/D with a top gun, I could achieve the same K/D with an inferior gun.  In Advanced Warfare, that's not the case.  I cannot come close to achieving what the top guns can get me with the inferior guns.  Sure, I can still have decent games with the inferior ones, but hardly ever GREAT games.

CodAW,3cf9j2,agarret83,0,Tue Jul 7 16:11:16 2015 UTC,It's not a big buff to the bulldog when you consider that the 20 damage range of the s12 is 225.  The whole 1800 rpm thing for the sn6's first few rounds is because the first few rounds are supposed to fire at 1200 rpm on console but for whatever reason don't.

CodAW,3cf9j2,RdJokr,0,Tue Jul 7 15:28:26 2015 UTC,"The ARX needs that range so that more variants besides the hole puncher and steel bite are useful. That way the normal 1 burst kill range is 900 and the high damage variant 1 burst kill range is 1500. the bulldog needs its gung ho spread fixed. It also needs a reason to be used over the s12 which it currently does not. Giving it better 30 damage range would give more of a reason to use it over the s12. It also is severely lacking in ammo, especially when you consider the requirements to get extended mags (25 double kills) the s12 in currently in a situation where extended mags is a necesity. Increasing the ammo to 12 would fix that the hbr nerf is slight and mostly because of the insanity. It would still be very powerful, but wouldn't quite have the ridiculous 3hk range that it currently has that's an epm3 buff. It would allow the epm3 to 2 body shot kill up to 1040 but the recoil increase would keep it from being abused. what's crazy about it? The sn6 needs something to make it more powerful without making into another asm1 the tac19 isn't consistent enough for a 1hk shotgun. Reducing the spread would make it more consistent. that 2hk range would only be knifing range"

However saying all of that I tossed on the two rockets like in the vid and usually a trophy system, since most will run at you so you don't need the recon thing.   I have to be less aggressive with the thing and use the map to my advantage. If I do that then it can be reasonably fun and I can usually get around 6-9 kills with it. I still think a module that would allow you to control it remotely would be better or a escape module so that you don't have to end your streak...I mean when you are on a 20 or higher streak you don't care really about using an assault drone since you can hide somewhere while you destroy people.

Quickscoping isn't out of control, the pro scene is using it (even without using overkill), people are using it ""the way snipers are suppose to be used"", and it hardly gets complained about."
CodAW,3cheqk,Danger-Cl0se,2,Wed Jul 8 00:45:35 2015 UTC,I just hope they make it so you can put both Variable Zoom and the Ballistic CPU. I see no reason for not being able to equip both.

Your aim started out wide right and low, crossed over him (first hitmarker) then came back on (next two) before he boosted back around the corner. It was a very good effort - he totally had the drop on you but you still almost got him on the turn."
CodAW,3ccnef,AutoDan,20,Mon Jul 6 21:42:53 2015 UTC,Its Hardpoint. Only one person needs to be in the obj. It doesnt go any faster. People outside of the hardpoint slaying is how you really win..
CodAW,3ccnef,Stupiddum,2,Mon Jul 6 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"I completely get that and that is how the game ended up going for us, we did win with just me sat in the hardpoint. Unfortunately it very rarely works like that though.   One player or even two players cannot sit in the hardpoint and defend against 6 who are playing the objective whilst the rest of your team is trying to guess their spawns on the other side of the map.  If you're lucky enough to come up against players with the same mindset you're fine, come up against competent players playing the objective then you're screwed."
CodAW,3ccnef,ProtectoRofAssguarD,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:19:06 2015 UTC,Normally id have 2 slayers one jumping in point and one staying in point. You are correct though.
CodAW,3ccnef,kekeagain,6,Mon Jul 6 23:46:28 2015 UTC,"Pubs aren't taken as seriously because of the high amount of random players each having their own objective, whether it's padding their stats or completing challenges.  As much as you want people to play the game how it's meant to be played, you have to remember that they ultimately paid for the game just as you have and can do as they please.  That's just the nature of pub games.  If you want likeminded players in pub games you will need to find friends that share your goal.  So while yes, I understand your frustration, I also don't think you need to send him a message over it as he's probably set in his ways."
CodAW,3ccnef,backstroker1991,4,Mon Jul 6 23:30:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. I don't understand everyone's emphasis on being labeled a casual. I don't play competitively, but I play to win every time I play. I may not use the best setup every game, but I'll always try to help my team win. For some reason, most players feel that being a casual player means you can play the game however you want, and being an absolute deadweight to your team is okay as long as you're having fun.   I'm glad you posted this. This would get downvoted to hell in the BO3 sub."

CodAW,3ccnef,Ry_Ve,2,Tue Jul 7 06:29:50 2015 UTC,"I hate to be that person, but it's never going to happen. People are always going to dip hills in pub hardpoint, not cap flags in dom and play for the last kill in SnD rather than planting the bomb. The only thing you can do is try to pick up their slack. I would say play ranked but it's a total joke so... I don't know man."
CodAW,3ccnef,Johtoboy,2,Tue Jul 7 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"There is no reward for objective play in Call of Duty, aside from death (and a pointless number called a W/L ratio). If they're going to add streaks which reward playing like a bitch, they ought to add rewards for playing the game mode correctly. Objective players need a support package that only rewards objective play."
CodAW,3ccnef,CrapNeck5000,3,Mon Jul 6 22:20:23 2015 UTC,"I play the objective and I get tons of score streaks.  My SPM is 615, that gets you score streaks."
CodAW,3ccnef,Johtoboy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:16:45 2015 UTC,Then you are really good. But all the bad players (and even average ones) have a better chance of camping to earn the high scorestreaks.

You have to understand that people play games for fun and just because winning is fun to you, doesn't mean other people play the game for that reason.  Some people like to quick scope on 20 sensitivity and go 10-40 every game.  I personally enjoy winning, but I also don't mind losing a game where I get a ridiculous amount of kills and objective play and end up losing.  If you aren't having fun in a certain lobby you can just leave or try to have fun an alternative way."

CodAW,3ccnef,PopeLeoVII,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:08:41 2015 UTC,This is the exact reason I refuse to play team objectives solo.  Hands down favorite game mode is Dom.  Hardpoint and even CTF have grown on me and find them quite enjoyable.    Unless you are with a party these game modes are straight up unwinnable.   Which...is why they need to implement a mercenary playlist.  If you are playing solo why on earth am I constantly thrown into lobbys with full parties.
CodAW,3ccnef,evils_twin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"Competitive means that winning is your main objective.  Pubs have the reputation of having fun as the main objective.  Perhaps fun for you is winning, but that means your a competitive person.  So if you are a competitive person why not move on the League Play or Gamebattles?  Unless it's easy wins against teams not going for the objective you are after, then you really can't complain when your team mates aren't going for the objective either."
CodAW,3ccnef,evils_twin,3,Tue Jul 7 16:50:39 2015 UTC,I'd likely play competitive if there was some way to queue solo but alas there is not and I don't fancy getting pummelled by teams.
CodAW,3ccnef,BizarroCranke,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:53:45 2015 UTC,"well, even in pubs, the most effective way to win is to play with a team.  If you like winning so much, play with friends.  I myself prefer to go solo, and because of that I accept that I am at a huge disadvantage and that my team mates are not likely to help.  So I stick mainly to TDM where a single player can make the biggest difference compared to other game modes."
CodAW,3ccnef,hunterhdtv,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"Please help educate me since I had been a mainly FFA player, but this last couple of months, I've ventured out more and more to different modes.  I always play single and don't foresee joining any clans etc. In Dom I understand the objective. I try capping A and C, but I feel like I have to keep moving between these spots since there is never the right coverage there and I have to feel like I need to pull my weight in capturing/re-capturing those spots.  I also can't stay in the same area for long lengths of time (maybe attention span or something lol) but I do try to defend when I can. I've built this distinct CAMPING IS SIN that I think feeds into that, but I understand that a person has to do a form of camping to defend points obviously.   Am I a jerk, or still the novice trying to figure out my place in the Dom world?"
CodAW,3ccnef,Quintkub,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:40:55 2015 UTC,"I don't play Domination myself but I get the feeling you would need to move between points if want the win, holding down just one point like you would in Hardpoint isn't going to work in Domination.  A jerk in Domination would be the person running straight past points and gunning everybody down, it sounds as if you're focusing on securing points which for me would be the right way to do it."

How it got chosen for a 24/7 playlist is beyond me.  It was infrared snipers and infrared Pytaeks and that is it.  The A flag side has such an enormous advantage with that fucking balcony it just absolutely ruins every single game mode.  What a disaster.  Second, I played a lot last night.  probably 3-4 hours, which is way more than i usually get to play (the mrs. was busy so i got to have a bachelor night lol)  I started at prestige 13 level 46.  I did eventually finally get to prestige, and got one ASD of course.  Throughout the matches i got somewhere between 6 and 7 supply drops.  We were told there was an increased elite drop rate correct?   I got exactly one elite from the drops combined, and yes it came from the ASD, and yes it was a duplicate.    I know RNG, but for christ's sake, if you are going to pimp it up as an increased elite drop rate, at least make it worth our damn while."

CodAW,3cgaxq,peros2,0,Fri Jul 10 04:14:30 2015 UTC,"With Riot shield equipped, use the Exo shield. While it's up, tap (button to change weapon). The Exo shield stays up, but when you release the it you will pull out your secondary weapon (or knife if no secondary is equipped) and can melee pretty quick. Don't really know how useful this would be (with Fast Melee you could just double-tap them in the time it takes to do this) but I've noticed it does slightly throw people off when you pull up the Exo Shield with Riot Shield. Maybe that moment of confusion is enough to get the kill."

Are completely pointless and useless outside of hardcore. The fact that they continue to add more ASD shit and purple guns rather than try and balance the game is pathetic, oh and wall breaches. Those are still a huge problem for infected players and can't possibly require more than a few minutes of a devs time to add some insta-death barriers.

CodAW,3cg02h,basedtomato,3,Wed Jul 8 14:53:09 2015 UTC,"There's a lot that's right about AW, and a lot that's wrong.  One of the reason AW catches so much shit, in my opinion, is because it's hard. The skill gap that exo movement created is definitely part of the equation for why people complain. Additionally, SBMM combined with the twitchy 3d-movement, makes for a very difficult, unfamiliar, and uncomfortable combat experience. Most of the vocal minority you're referring to are likely the players that used to head glitch in a power position with a thermal LMG and rack up kills and/or camp all day long. AW has put that in the past, and they are left with poor mechanics and tons of excuses.  The self-entitled cry babies that play COD are (generally speaking) a much younger crowd (ranging from age 9 to early 20's). This new generation of gamers is used to having everything put on a silver platter for them so they can maintain a fantasy of not sucking balls at video games. AW makes most people feel like less of a bad ass (for aforementioned reasons) so people hate on the game instead of practicing and trying better themselves. I think it's important to remember that modern COD players would rather bang their head on the wall and bitch at the devs for not installing a door, rather than crawl under it.  I for one find this game to be more fun than any other COD I have played. I LOVE the movement system, I LOVE the pace, and I LOVE the anti-camp design. It suits my play style and preferences well."
CodAW,3cg02h,basedtomato,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:00:16 2015 UTC,I also love that there are nearly no campers ever. When I play a different call of duty I really notice it
CodAW,3cg02h,EmotiveCDN,6,Tue Jul 7 20:54:07 2015 UTC,Because it is the easiest one to bitch about. The whole exo movement is a reason you couldn't use in past CoDs and that's why they hate it.
CodAW,3cg02h,uncircled_swag,0,Tue Jul 7 17:51:18 2015 UTC,Could be the reason
CodAW,3cg02h,tyzenberg,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"The one thing that saves SHG imo is the fact that it's their first cod. This game feels like a carbon copy of BO2 features with a boost jump. Maybe their next game will have its own unique ""sledgehammer"" feel because they will have more experience developing cod games. Dont forget that WaW was Treyarch's first real ""modern"" CoD game (I'm not talking about the setting, but rather how the game feels) and it was essentially a WW2 version of CoD4 with vehicles and a few new perks. Zombies of course was something totally new but I'm focusing on the multiplayer. It wasn't until Black Ops 1 that Treyarch really gave a unique style and ""feel"" to their games."
CodAW,3cg02h,Eddisern,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:45:42 2015 UTC,Treyarc is also the team that takes the parts that they like and perfect them. But treyarc wasnt great from the beginning and I think sledgehammer had a much better one. They will improve

In short, weapon variants should never ever change weapon stats, especially if they can't be earned (I know certain guns like the speakeasy can be ""earned"" at the master prestige levels, but that shouldn't even be a thing).

I also like to target other people with a lot of weapons master gear, they tend to be good opponents and we usually have good gunfights.

I used his third technique except I played core, the warbirds still counted. I would also say it's best to find an isolated area of the map before calling it in, the corner of the map in the area you're spawning works best. It will only move to shoot an enemy or if you do, so if there's no enemies around and you stand still it will stay completely stationary.

CodAW,3cdvjb,chopmeatsandwich,3,Tue Jul 7 04:43:25 2015 UTC,"I found the Eagle Eye variant very usable before the rebalancing of the weapon.  It had a 2HK range longer than the 3hk range of any ASM1 variant with advanced rifling.  Match that with zero recoil and a good trigger finger, I had games where I was destroying people and finishing top of the scoreboard.  If your trigger finger or aim is slightly off however, you had trouble competing.  They screwed up the buff by giving it odd multipliers instead of better range."
CodAW,3cdvjb,tyzenberg,2,Tue Jul 7 03:51:22 2015 UTC,When did the MK14 have a 2HK potential? I thought it was always 3-4 shots.
CodAW,3cdvjb,RuriM,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:56:16 2015 UTC,It was 3 to 4 until the most recent buff  Now it's 2hk with a headshot from any range  But yeah the guy you're replying to might have his info off
CodAW,3cdvjb,Maschinengewehr,5,Tue Jul 7 03:59:28 2015 UTC,"No, it used to do 48 damage at close range, so the chest multiplier made it a 2SK. Now you have to get a headshot for one, so I think the last patch actually made it worse unless you can consistently get headshots"
CodAW,3cdvjb,tyzenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:39:11 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly what the original damage profile was or what the multipliers were, but IIRC you had to get a headshot or 2 chest shots or something like that.  I think I have the original stats sheet on my tablet at home, if somebody doesn't post them before I get home, I'll see if I can find them.  Edit*  Quick reddit search says damage profile was 48-33-25 with a 1.1X chest and neck multipler (wasn't able to find head multiplier).  This means MK14 had a 2hk up close if one shot hit the chest or neck."
CodAW,3cdvjb,Maschinengewehr,2,Tue Jul 7 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"Its original damage was 48 up close. I think it still has the multipliers, but yeah, no two shot range"

You treat it like the MK14 from MW3 or a marksman rifle from ghosts and you are going places, it can outsnipe snipers in middle range and pick off targets at longer ranges with a bigger magazine than the Snipers and much quicker"
CodAW,3cdvjb,sonichu1488,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"I know I should use it as marksman rifle, but the idle sway made it so I couldn't use it at long range. I found it most useful when just used as an assault rifle."
CodAW,3cdvjb,backstroker1991,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:21:08 2015 UTC,"It's not that bad. If the sway actually effects you, then you need to get closer to the target. Try using the acog/hybrid sight on it, if you need to just add a foregrip. If you really want to use it like a old school M14 from cod4/mw3, then putting a quickdraw and stock on it should help."

I'm OK shot with it and can get some kills, but it's really frustrating and it's  not viable in a fast paced game filled with Steeds, Infernos, Insanities, hole punchers, steel bites, three or four of the IMRs, Loopholes, magnitudes and speakeasys.

CodAW,3cdvjb,tyzenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"The mk14 would be a lot more usable if they did they following:   reduce centerspeed by 200 so that grip and +accuracy variants are useful change the multi from 1.1 to a 1.5 torso and neck multi so that it can 2 body shot up to 650 units and 3 body shot past that.   But if they did that they would need to rework the epm3 by doing the following:   reduce centerspeed by 250 change damage back to 34-34-33, but add a 1.5 torso and neck multi so it can 2 body shot up to 1040 make the exterminator 39-34-33 (1 headshot kills up to 650), -1dmg variants 34-34-24, and -2 damage variants 34-33-24."

CodAW,3car5y,ozarkslam21,3,Mon Jul 6 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is stupid that BOTH are optional. You have to go through steps to make it end, and it is very unlikely that a team can 3nd it without your cooperation."
CodAW,3car5y,LiquidRitz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"its happened to me before.  The only way in which I would even somewhat be ok with it, is if ending the game took the cooperation of all 4 players simultaneously, i.e. the beginning of the eclipse in the shangri-la EE.  everyone should have to turn their key.  I've had multiple games of MotD where whoever was the weasel ended the game when the rest of us didn't want to.  The easter egg should advance the story, while giving a reward that makes it worth while that helps you achieve higher rounds, but IMO there should be no way to actually ""win"" zombies."
CodAW,3car5y,ozarkslam21,2,Mon Jul 6 17:03:58 2015 UTC,Well that's very narrow minded and clearly doesn't appeal to as many gamers as the choice to end does.
CodAW,3car5y,rds92,2,Mon Jul 6 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"it is not narrow minded, it is an opinion.

CodAW,3cd02k,compaqesc,2,Mon Jul 6 23:18:15 2015 UTC,It's really whatever you feel comfortable doing. I have a friend who stays mostly on the ground and only dashes side to side and it works pretty well for him.
CodAW,3cd02k,TheRealPdGaming,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what I've adapted to doing. I don't really feel comfortable using the boost jump and pretty much get shot out of the air if I use it any longer then one jump. I guess it's just frustrating because now when I see someone, not only do I have to react, I have to guess whether or not they're going to jump and where they're going to jump to."
CodAW,3cd02k,TheRealPdGaming,2,Mon Jul 6 23:26:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to get used to it though, I recommend just practice on bots. That's what I used to learn how to do it"
CodAW,3cd02k,xTeh,2,Tue Jul 7 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"Typically, it's situational. What matters first and foremost is that you can get your aim on target and be able to hit them when you pull the trigger. The reason that a lot of people boost jump (although they may not realize this) is two things: One, it throws off the other persons aim. Pretty simple, if you're aiming at something, and it suddenly jumps out of your view/line of fire, it's going to screw you up and make you adjust which takes time. Two, it gives you height advantage. This is especially useful when someone is already higher up than you, or is behind cover. However, it also shrinks the amount of available hitboxes - for both parties. Meaning both you and them are harder to hit. The reason why this gives you an advantage is because their reduced hitbox includes mainly their head/upper chest, and yours is more torso/lower body.  Now another thing to keep in mind is that immediately after boosting, there is a slight delay where you cannot fire your gun, so this can be a negative if you do go for boost first. Typically, if someone gets the jump on you, is at a higher position, behind cover, is jumping as well, or you are already wounded, it's not a bad idea to boost jump first. Any other time, you're just wasting time that you could be killing them and potentially giving yourself away.   This is also assuming that you are good at tracking targets and you have pretty decent aim. If not, stick to the ground and use side to side dashes."

CodAW,3cd02k,tyzenberg,2,Tue Jul 7 08:00:51 2015 UTC,"To add on this, a good tactic that works for me is to use an exo dash as soon as I see them use one.  Just keep in mind you get two dashes then a delay before you can dash again."
CodAW,3cd02k,F8M8,2,Tue Jul 7 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"I will usually do a single jump and a dash in a direction perpendicular to where I'm being shot from.  While doing this, I will also start turning to the direction that I am being shot from."
CodAW,3cdeo9,WantAndAble,2,Tue Jul 7 01:17:26 2015 UTC,"It will be the best $2 you can spend in this game. I bought one set of the extra armory slots and I only delete duplicates.

Complete a few gear sets etc etc. Keep your elite guns look up which professional guns are better than the elites for example the IMR and ARX variants.   Stop wanting to keep every item as its will never happen so stick to your no micro transactions policy don't change it for this game and compromise on the other.

CodAW,3cd9c8,Disc_Hunt,2,Tue Jul 7 09:28:41 2015 UTC,"Try-hard is a terrible name, and is overused to the point of ridiculousness. Basically whenever the term try-hard is used bad sportsmanship is involved. I would say at least 90% of players who use the term are sore losers who are probably trying harder than the person on top of the leaderboard in the first place. These are the people that say stuff like ""I let you win"" or ""I could have been in first place if I wanted"". The other 10% or less of people are labeled try-hard for a reason, but the name is still misleading. These players tend to be sore winners and losers too, if things arent going their way they will rage quit every time. Even when they go 50-10 they're complaining about getting killed unfairly, and when they go 50-3 they talk shit to the whole lobby.  I just hate the term and think it should die, as it just sounds absurd on the surface. We are all try-hards, the person who doesn't care at all about winning is still trying hard to have fun. I never tried as hard as when I did the camo challenges but I also died and lost more than ever before. Some players have natural skill and consistently top the leaderboards but barely try at all. Besides being a terrible label, I hate the implication that it's not ""cool"" to try to win or do well, as if mediocrity is what ""normal"" people should settle for. Imagine if this mentality was applied to sports, people would say ""yeah Michael Jordan scores a lot of points but he's just a try-hard douchebag ruining everyone else's fun.""  Wow I surprised myself with the length of this rant but I despise the label try-hard and the implication that good players are somehow doing something wrong and should just change their playstyle so someone else can have more fun, even though that someone else would probably just find something new to complain about anyway."
CodAW,3cd9c8,tyzenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:05:57 2015 UTC,"I'm man enough to admit that I've called people a tryhard, but it's was to myself and out of frustration.  Don't take it negatively, don't change how you play, don't let other people tell you how to play.  The reason I have called somebody a tryhard, is almost a way to keep my confidence up.  If I'm trying to unlock the no perks/no attachments camo for the RW1, I'm not going to have good games.  Calling other people a tryhard (to myself) is a way to remind me that, even though I'm going 1-15, I would probably be kicking their ass if I was using the ASM1.  Anybody actually saying it to somebody is just a whiny little bitch."
CodAW,3cd9c8,ozarkslam21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:29:07 2015 UTC,"try-hard is a term that average to below average players use to describe players that beat their ass.  It is a deflection technique to mask their inadequacies by basically saying ""well i lost, but it's because i am not trying hard like these 'try-hard' losers in here""   basically saying they could win every game but they just aren't trying which is obviously a crock of shit.  If the term could be completely erased from the history of CoD we would all be better off"

CodAW,3ca6ot,Hahaitsactuallyfal9,6,Mon Jul 6 08:41:34 2015 UTC,Streaks from the Orbital Care Package also have 2 module presets per each tier you can get them in. while higher streaks like the Paladin will only be in the gold level while others like the Assault Drone don't go above or below blue.  The color also means how many modules the streak has and not the value of the streak itself.   Green = 1 Module Blue = 2 Modules Gold = 3 Modules
CodAW,3ca6ot,Danger-Cl0se,4,Mon Jul 6 09:07:24 2015 UTC,"It bugs me that the Assault Drone has 2 blue modules. I wanna re-roll the DIY version and keep the AI, but I don't know until I've already picked it up!"

You can't ask a question like that, the results won't even come near what the real result would have been. If I were to think what the real results would be, the KD would be much closer to 1.00, or even below that, and WL probably around 0.60 (tons of ragequitters here, don't lie) and SPM around 250-300"
CodAW,3c8iga,Eddisern,10,Sun Jul 5 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"The people here are probably more knowledgeable of the game, so they end up doing better."
CodAW,3c8iga,turtleturtlerandy,2,Mon Jul 6 00:05:25 2015 UTC,I think WL ratio is broken. If I check mine by modes I predominately play they each say over 1.0 but in my stats it says .88. Don't know how that works.
CodAW,3c8iga,BlazeDemBeatz,2,Sun Jul 5 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"Rage quitting and disconnecting count towards the WL too, but not towards the WL in the game modes section (only on Operator). I was a giant rage quitter before and I still ragequit from time to time, mostly if my whole team leave in the middle of the match and I'm up against people in Grand Master. Yeah no way I'm smashing my KD just because they can get a grin on their face when I go 5-30. So by modes I also have much higher than 1 on everything but my overall WL is 0.59 lol.  Also, I've had a lot of lag issues in this game so I sometimes get disconnected from matches every single day. My sluggish internet has something to do with it (to be honest, I can't have e.g. my PC downloading something and playing at the same time, it has to be one or another for me) but AW has something to do with it as well. And unfortunately, disconnecting counts as a loss too :/"
CodAW,3c8iga,Eddisern,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a rage quitter though I've sat in some really terrible matches and stayed because the consistency in this game is so skewed I can get spanked one match and do really well the next. But when I do leave is 2 reasons, they throw me in the middle of team potatoes 84-23 spanking and if the people seem laggy in the lobby, and these 2 happen quite often.

CodAW,3c73xg,Tayette,11,Sun Jul 5 14:17:38 2015 UTC,What if instead of all this they just reduced it to 675 points?
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,5,Sun Jul 5 14:57:53 2015 UTC,"It would just be cheaper, not viable."
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,5,Sun Jul 5 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"I think 675 would make it worth it considering:   a missile strike is 650 and that can't get many kills with hardwired the goliath would be 575 for only +100 you can add rockets (so basically the old cost would get you a goliath that can shoot rockets) for only +50 you can give it trophy system, so the idea would be that for the same cost as a bombing run you get a goliath that can't be killed with rockets."
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"But it's still not a viable streak when I can, instead, grab something like the Assault Drone for near the same cost and get far more kills without having to end my streak to use it."
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,3,Sun Jul 5 20:48:34 2015 UTC,That's why the assault drone with rockets should be 850 or 950.
CodAW,3c73xg,ImMalteserMan,0,Sun Jul 5 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"Bad example. I could have said 'Missile Strike' or 'System Hack' or even 'Sentry Gun' and could have made the same point: Climbing into a Goliath suit is a death sentence, and an end to your streak more often than not. It should be and feel like a Paladin in that it does a lot of damage in a limited time.  Almost any other streak reward is better than the Goliath if you intend on keeping your streak going."
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,3,Sun Jul 5 20:56:22 2015 UTC,Or they should just lower the cost of the streak to make it more appealing. 6 kills with hardline for a streak with no time limit sounds fair to me.
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:20:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think lethal score streaks should be priced based on how many kills they get on average.   The assault drone + rocket upgrade is so strong, I would regularly get 6-7 kills with it which is good for 750 pts.  But the Goliath, probably only average 1-2 kills with it, half the time you have lost half your health before you fully get in it and then when you do it is a hit marker machine whereas the assault drone + rocket upgrade is normally OHK if you are accurate,  sometimes two hits."
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,3,Sun Jul 5 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"Considering that assault drone with rockets is more effective than a warbird, I think the other problem/solution is that rockets on assault drones cost too little and should be raised to +400 or even +500.  Goliaths are vulnerable to a lot of things, but if it were 675 without Hardwired then it would be worth using in spite of those vulnerabilities. It's also a much easier solution to implement than the many things the OP suggested."
CodAW,3c73xg,BlazeDemBeatz,0,Sun Jul 5 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"But it still wouldn't be viable. A glaring issue I didn't bring up, because changing it would be controversial, is that getting into a Goliath is the same as saying ""my killstreak ends here.""  Lowering the cost won't fix that, it would arguably make it worse.  For 650 points, I can get a missile and grab a kill or two and not have to worry about my health not regenerating or the whole enemy team knowing where I am because I used the missile. Hell, I don't even have to worry about a teammate stealing my missile because he's greedy, because he can't.  The Goliath can be stolen from you by teammates and enemies alike, paints a huge 'shoot me' target on the minimap while simultaneously making it more difficult to earn any killstreaks above itself, due to the reduced kill points and non-regenerating health.  Instead of making it cheaper, it should be made better, worth using, and worth the death sentence and risk of losing it.  But that's just, like, my opinion man."
CodAW,3c73xg,ejrivas13,3,Sun Jul 5 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"First off, i'm just thinking of solutions that are actually viable. Your long list is not realistic.  Second, last I checked players are vulnerable while controlling kill streaks.  Third, yes, the Goliath shows up on the map and players are encouraged to approach the Goliath. But let's be real, unless it's some guy who gets a lucky stomp or the most accurate headshotter in the world, you are going to win gunfights even against multiple people easily as they all approach you thinking they are going to get that 250 points. I have a class that has a Goliath and whenever I earn the Goliath I get at least 3 or 4 kills with it almost every time because of dumb players thinking they can challenge a Goliath.  And finally, yes it ends your streak, but in return the Goliath has no time limit unlike every other streak in the game, so if you are good with the Goliath like some people, the thing can last you for a while."
CodAW,3c73xg,ChuckNorrisWithEbola,0,Sun Jul 5 21:13:28 2015 UTC,You're right about it not being realistic; Sledgehammer would never balance their game.
CodAW,3c73xg,Camocheese,2,Sun Jul 5 22:07:43 2015 UTC,Sledgehammer would never implement 3 million changes just to balance one killstreak.  Even treyarch wouldn't do that and they are much more committed to balancing their game.
CodAW,3c73xg,georgerumsfeld,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:35:31 2015 UTC,"Good thing that I didn't type up three million, just a few?  Do you think that I was proposing every idea?"

CodAW,3c73xg,BlazeDemBeatz,9,Mon Jul 6 02:43:18 2015 UTC,OMG!! Boost slammed by a Goliath killing all enemies or causing damage in a certain radius. Lol
CodAW,3c73xg,basedtomato,5,Sun Jul 5 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"I've got an idea for making the Goliath viable:  Add regenerative health. That simple.   Or alternatively, make the Goliath cheaper and add regenerative health as a module."
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,3,Sun Jul 5 21:48:50 2015 UTC,"The flinch has to be reduced. The flinch is in my opinion the worst thing about the Goliath. I often end up taking a large amount of damage from the first opponent I encounter because I can't shoot him if all my bullets fly over the dude. The flinch allows players to take the Goliath head on when that should be the one thing players should avoid. The main gun also sucks, it deals terrible damage and shoots slowly. Thankfully the recoil can be mitigated by tapfiring.   I like the minigun module suggestion, preferably built into the machine by default. Something that shreds through people like the death machine in BO1 would be great. If it had something that insanely powerful then the terrible mobility would be more justified."
CodAW,3c73xg,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:13:42 2015 UTC,The gun also has terrible accuracy
CodAW,3c73xg,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:56:51 2015 UTC,After getting all the calling cards for the streaks I decided the Goliath was my least favorite streak.  Not because you couldn't get kills.  If you know what you're doing you can destroy the other team.  Just get inside and hold a small area like the school in Detroit.  I've gotten 20+ kills with one before.  Because it only ends when you're destroyed it can last the whole game.  My problems are that for one it can be stolen.  It should have a hidden drop module or something like that.  Another problem is that boost slams are way to powerful.  A extra head armor module could help with that.  And lastly I always forget about the self destruct feature.  You can get a crap load of kills from that alone.  A module for an automatic self destruct when you die would be great.
CodAW,3ca4jp,Therektdan,5,Mon Jul 6 08:08:51 2015 UTC,"You'll usually see people boost and jump around more in objective game modes like Uplink, Momentum, or Domination. another option is the Exo Grapple playlist if you have any of the DLC maps."

CoD already had a bad problem with hit boxes lagging behind the player model, but with exos you can basically fucking teleport, so almost every time an exo boost or dodge is made, you might as well accept your fate. Chances are your hit box is about 2 feet behind/in front of/below you."
CodAW,3c7f11,EverThinker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:57:13 2015 UTC,Yep and the main reason it makes single burst guns like the mk14 and emp3 extremely unviable due to the accuracy required when using vs spray and pray weapons like the asm1 or bal.

CodAW,3c7f11,kekeagain,2,Mon Jul 6 15:53:36 2015 UTC,I agree. The whole damage system wasn't properly thought out IMO. TTK rates should be longer for ur basic SMGs and ARs and this would solve the problem. It would actually solve some of the lag comp problems in certain situations also.

CodAW,3c7vw1,BlazeDemBeatz,4,Sun Jul 5 18:52:22 2015 UTC,I've spent the last two weeks working on Royalty for the EMP3 and it is easily the worst gun in the game. The flash is blinding and the shots travel so slowly that moving enemies are practically invincible. I've found that running into battle with a pillow does more damage than this thing.
CodAW,3c7vw1,Ask_If_Im_A_Cactus,4,Sun Jul 5 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The bullets don't travel slowly at all. The fire rate cap is extremely high, so you can keep spamming RT quickly.  It 3 shots at any distance as well, with little to no recoil. The only drawback is the muzzle flash."
CodAW,3c7vw1,stan3298,5,Sun Jul 5 20:06:44 2015 UTC,The real drawback is the fact that it has a hipspread even when ADS.
CodAW,3c7vw1,CrHjEoVgEdLeLnE,2,Sun Jul 5 21:43:06 2015 UTC,"At least from what I've experienced, that's not true at all. The gun sways when ADS'ing, but that's about it."

CodAW,3c7vw1,CrHjEoVgEdLeLnE,3,Sun Jul 5 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"It's very slight, but when you use the gun for a long time you start to notice it."

CodAW,3c7vw1,BoreasBoreas,-11,Mon Jul 6 14:06:42 2015 UTC,"Haha yea I found it nearly impossible to kill anyone in core mode with it because of the bal/asm1/insanity syndrome. So I went to hardcore. It took like 1 day to get the diamond for it that way. It's a one shot kill as long as lag comp don't interfere.  Also note: that guy I killed hiding in the corner was a grand master. I don't wanna be a dick but hardcore = pussy mode. If you play hardcore your usually a campy corner hiding sissy who rolls with a clan of at least 5 who all just hide in corners every game. No run n gun in hardcore. Just clans hiding in corners with insanities. I never ran into so many pathetic players. It was the same shit for the 2 days I played it. Spawn, try and run 5 ft and get mowed down by master prestige insanity camper in the corner. I went back to core to work on my last heavy for royalty and enjoy the fact I'm not the only person moving around the map 😎"
CodAW,3c7vw1,DilltheDough,2,Sun Jul 5 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"Hilarious. Us hardcore players look down on you no-skill run-and-gun core-losers who need fat HUDs and can miraculously shoot through your own squad. And it takes you all 4-5 shots to kill a guy - how is that even remotely realistic?!?  Some of us just check corners instead of running straight into someone who has staked out a strategic position so we don't often have your problem. And we don't need magical kill cams, we just look at where the bullets came from.   Don't call us pussies while you throw random grenades and shoot wildly, just come and fight Hardcore like a real soldier.  /shit talking off"
CodAW,3c7vw1,DilltheDough,5,Sun Jul 5 22:09:36 2015 UTC,Hahaha it's hilarious that people would hate on hc players. Usually when people cry about camping it's because they're unwilling to adapt styles other than rushing. I go to core and laugh at how easy it is to outplay these clowns.

CodAW,3c7vw1,42z3ro,-3,Mon Jul 6 02:56:36 2015 UTC,"If you find sitting in the corner with a noob tube fun then more power to you bro. The one thing u mention I did like was having to be more cautious in gunfights to not kill team mates. Otherwise no it's pretty arrogant to look down on rushing when the first thing u do is run to the nearest corner when you spawn and think its strategic. Strategic to me is figuring a path around the map that I can get behind the whole team and knock them all down.  Also note: If you watched my clip I was checking all the corners and what do u know. I found someone in a corner with his buddy camping above. Interesting, not like I'm making this stuff up lol"
CodAW,3c7vw1,maxhatcher,3,Sun Jul 5 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you got ""sitting in a corner with a noob tube"" out of ""tactical coverage of strategic spots,"" but you keep those false assumptions and judgements of hardcore if you like.  Are noob tubes used more in HC than core? I doubt it, as many HC players are in fact, hardcore, unlike the masses of noobs that frequent core. I would think that in core one could noob-tube without worry as your teammates cannot be hurt.   What I see is people who run and gun and get schooled accuse others of ""camping"" as a defense mechanism."
CodAW,3c7vw1,maxhatcher,0,Sun Jul 5 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"It's not that serious dude. Me and u can make a tube class, well each go sit in the corner and u after a sweaty day of trying as hard as we can I'll take u to Dairy Queen. Sounds like a plan. And yes, tubes are not used as much in core. I've never been blown up so many times ever. I was getting blown up as I'd spawn in even."
CodAW,3c7vw1,maxhatcher,3,Sun Jul 5 23:57:37 2015 UTC,"By your own admission, you did not spend much time in HC. You should try again as your experiences do not seem to mirror others'.  But I do not use noob-tubes, think that that is the worst part of CoD! They certainly are a problem as is attacking spawn-spots in some maps (i.e. Urban, Instinct, Sideshow). Instead we should play a match where you constantly run and gun and I strategically hop from tactical spot to tactical spot to watch objectives and important lane . Then we can go to Dairy Queen and you can buy and apologize for calling us stellar-tacticians ""campers.""  See you on the battlefield (in HC)!"
CodAW,3c7vw1,JdoesDDR,0,Mon Jul 6 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"I'll apologize but only to you because you got pulled into my stereo type and you enjoy hardcore. For that I'm wrong. But these bastards I played w for 2 days were always clans of 5-6 and never moved on the damn map. You'd have to been in my shoes to really feel what I'm saying. Just scared mentality and no skill IMO in a game that your meant to fly across the map at super speeds. I see nothing wrong with playing tactical as long as ur not sitting in the corner where u spawned waiting for me to move in 2 minutes later (like grand master in my clip). I don't just constantly rush it all depends on what I'm trying to accomplish. I play strategically when the timing is right or mood dependent. So with that said I respect your opinion and play style, but not so much the people I experienced. Hope that clears things up better."
CodAW,3c7vw1,JdoesDDR,2,Mon Jul 6 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"Good on you, and I imagine that we would get along in CoD.  In turn, I will admit (again) that some camp too often and for too long. And I will happily admit to rage-quitting (and even team-killing once) because of excessive noob-tube camping.   But I suggest that camping is more of a problem in noob-laden core than in hardcore. Not sure why you think otherwise, maybe others will chime in with their experiences."
CodAW,3c7vw1,BigBooce,0,Mon Jul 6 01:43:14 2015 UTC,"I can't lie. It kept crossing my mind to punch my team mates when I seen them in corners constantly but I resisted the urge lol. Instead I would throw a punch as a signal like ""let's go come with me"" but that didn't work. I'm sure I'll wind up back in HC again later hopefully a better experience."

When theres less then 25%/33% of the game remaining and the opposing team has no chance of winning, stop allowing people to filter into the game.  Keep them separate to get a new lobby going"

CodAW,3c5ipg,Johtoboy,3,Sun Jul 5 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"The Goliath on its' own is pretty weak. However, if it's used with 2-3 teammates around it, the streak can be a killing machine. With 2 decent protectors you can easily get 15+ kills out of it. Plus it can be used as an excellent distraction during objective-based games like hardpoint."
CodAW,3c5ipg,jonotorious,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:52:27 2015 UTC,Yup that's exactly what it's for. In real life a single tank isn't going to win the battle because a solider with the right equipment can take it out or at least avoid it.
CodAW,3c5ipg,youre_being_creepy,3,Sun Jul 5 14:52:55 2015 UTC,"Disable streaks and exos and watch em rip. Make sure to always equip all the rockets and trophy system. Extremely devastating on One shot(always go there when you have a reinforcement package, it appears on professional or elite)  People say this scorestreak sucks. It is not meant to be taken balls deep into enemy territory, it excels at killing soldiers trying to flank and small groups: With the rockets and your minigun, 1-3 soldiers don't stand a chance. More than that and somebody is bound to break your neck or fire a payload in your face. Remember to always keep moving and if possible, go where the objective is to support players. Like somebody said, easy to get, once you get the goliath it is easy to get the other streaks as well. Just remember to save it for the next round when this one is almost over"
CodAW,3c5ipg,sonichu1488,0,Sun Jul 5 01:45:35 2015 UTC,"Make sure to always equip all the rockets and trophy system.   Finally someone says it.

CodAW,3c5ipg,BlazeDemBeatz,0,Sun Jul 5 02:51:13 2015 UTC,Yeah that's actually the one way it becomes handy. If ur having problems capping B flag u can move in with it and usually live long enough to get the cap.

CodAW,3c5ipg,Camocheese,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:39:50 2015 UTC,"I sometimes run the Goliath just to give it to my teammates. It's funny how often my teammates tend to just ignore it. It's quite situational, mostly good in small closed areas like the B flag in Comeback Dom. The cool thing about the Goliath is that it can do objective work. It's actually good for capping flags in Domination.  The thing that sucks about the Goliath the most has to be the flinch. The flinch is awfully strong on the Goliath so you'll end up half dead in your first encounter because all your bullets fly over the enemy."

I don't feel the need to play anymore when the only thing it says after a match is ""you are prestige grand master"" and no animation, you can't see the full XP you got (I think it says 0 above the ""you are grand master"" bar), not anything.

CodAW,3c56v6,galaxie5OO,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:00:41 2015 UTC,Domination should be a steady income for xp. Easy to play not too stressful. You won't really run into too many bad games unlike Hard Point or S and D.  You get 200xp for a flag cap. But also realise get a kill on a flag attacking or defending and thats 150 xp get a double kill while they pile on a flag thats 300xp. So always get kills around a flag.   A UAV with assist points and score streak kills will all help you get xp. Also play with guns you never play with or work through the guns you like to unlock achievements with the guns for a bit more xp. Hit a few camo challenges and gun unlocks and you can go from a standard 15-20k xp game to 30-40k xp every now and then.

Other than that, PTFO in Domination or Hardpoint for best results.

The game engine has a high base ping, on top of the network lag from your internet. Ever since I got my www.NetDuma.com router I have no issues with the game. I ping 20ms to every dedicated server and I'm on the winning end of the lag 99% of the time."

CodAW,3c5lng,igot6shots,2,Sun Jul 5 07:33:23 2015 UTC,Depends to where you and that guy with 60 ms are pinging to. Ping isn't some number that's always the same. That's why it doesn't matter that I'm pinging 10 ms to a local server. If the matchmaking is putting me against people in other countries.. then there's a high possibility I'm gonna suffer (or them).
CodAW,3c5lng,BlazeDemBeatz,0,Sun Jul 5 11:55:04 2015 UTC,My ping almost always says between 70-80ms in the Xbox :-(
CodAW,3c5lng,toonicetosayno,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:23:55 2015 UTC,Mine says that too. It's probably because we are pinging to Washington State.

I've tried everything imaginable to lower it but apparently that's all it will give me. i know its not terrible but when u add in all the other factors i feel like I'm getting cheated out of deserved kills and unnesecary deaths too often
CodAW,3c5lng,tuname1t,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:05:20 2015 UTC,"The only time that ping number is relevant is if you are connecting to the Seattle dedicated server. For all other games your ping will vary game to game, depending on where the host is.

CodAW,3c4pd2,Leohurr,8,Sat Jul 4 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a pre-order bonus (like it should have been), it was a bonus for season pass holders so it technically costs money. Instead of making it useful for everyone by making it free, they're charging $5 for it. It should be free because it is absolutely worthless the way it is right now. I feel bad for anybody that actually bought it separately because it cripples matchmaking. I think most people that bought the season pass would be fine with it being free for everyone since, as it is right now, it's hardly even playable. It's doing nobody any good when lots of people delete it just to fix the shitty matchmaking that results from having it installed.  It's a shame, really. I only played it a few times (2 or 3 times in the dedicated playlist that was hidden away and maybe twice when it was in regular rotation) and it seemed like it would have been a good map for the game. They should make it free and give anybody that bought it separately or with the season pass a bunch (as in way more than what $5 normally gets you with those stupid ripoffs) of free ASDs as a treat. I want to play the map but I'm not about to make my matchmaking pool even worse than it already is just to occasionally play Atlas Gorge between the nonstop Riot/Detroit/Solar rotation."
CodAW,3c4pd2,_swamp,2,Sat Jul 4 19:33:58 2015 UTC,As a season pass holder I wouldn't mind having it be free. I enjoy the map very much but barely get to play it (in hardcore) most likely because of matchmaking
CodAW,3c4pd2,DPancoast,2,Sun Jul 5 00:14:41 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. I played it a couple times (season pass holder) and it was a lot of fun. However I had to delete it (along with all dlc) because I can't find games with them installed. Very unfortunate. You pay for the season pass and are crippled for having it. At least if atlas gorge was free it would fix some of the matchmaking issues people experience and add a new map to the rotation that people could play.

CodAW,3c3ui6,thekyle1591,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:40:23 2015 UTC,I've gotten 17000. Was something like 75-36 with 22 caps and 25 defends.  It was comeback Dom and I basically flipped the spawns every minute or so while running through B and killing people. Don't have a screenshot unfortunately. Usually I'd say run with a full team for insane games but every time I've ever broken 10 k it was on a shit team that allowed me to get all the kills and caps. I've broken 10 k probably 40-50 times and only ever done it with another guy on my team breaking 10 k twice.

For as many kills as you get you're getting a shit ton of assist points as well. Additonally, an assist with the UAV and system hack up is like 70 points.   It honestly takes a very special game to get a score like this. Your team has to be bad but not god awful. The other team needs to go for flags as well, but not get too many kills. The longer the game the more score you can get."
CodAW,3c3ui6,SeptixG,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"I even run the hack without disable exos so I can get them more often for the extra assisst points. The one time I got over 9000 points in one half, my team got rekt and I destroyed 3 paladins with the system hacks. I think I got like 700 score with one hack, destroying a paladin, an assualt drone and UAVs. Usually everyone quits though, these Lobbys are super rare."
CodAW,3c3ui6,BlazeDemBeatz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"I only run disable because the amount of kills I get with it up is so ridiculous that it out weights the assist benefits of 2-3 more a game.

I am already paying full price for the game and + the season pass, as if that is not enough.... I know I can play the game without buying a single supply drop, but that is not what my concern is.. imagine if COD in the future (most likely SHG) will have a pay wall and half of the guns are locked, the only way to unlock these guns would be to buy something like supply drops where you have a random chance of unlocking the guns.  imagine that... and tell me if they wont implement that kind of micro transactions in the future. and make it pay to win system, even though it kind of is now."

CodAW,3bywdk,toonicetosayno,3,Fri Jul 3 07:47:59 2015 UTC,"Is it confirmed that they look the same on your character? I remember a similar thread a few months ago and the duplicates actually look different when you equip them on your character. The game has multiple instances of item models looking different than their illustration, the Killer Exo you get for doing killer challenges is a great example.  The people in charge of the illustrations, menus, etc. are 2D artists, basically graphic designers. The people making the actual in game items are 3D modelers. It's possible they just decided not to make a new illustration for the new model and used a preexisting one that looks similar.  Maybe Sledgehammer/Activision are being cheap, maybe they assigned it to a lazy 2D artist who snuck it past his boss. Whoever made the decision they probably figured nobody would care or notice but of course there is always someone on the internet who does."

CodAW,3c081u,Jackamalio626,6,Fri Jul 3 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the MK14, though I've kinda lost hope for it.  As for the Wall Exploits, I don't see too many on Current-Gen anymore. I'm sure Last-Gen is plagued by them though."
CodAW,3c081u,Jackamalio626,7,Fri Jul 3 16:42:13 2015 UTC,"There's not a ton of exploiters in TDM or Dom, as they can be killed by wall penatration, but they are rampant in infected."
CodAW,3c081u,TheGoggs,0,Fri Jul 3 16:44:06 2015 UTC,No offense but I could care less about the mk14 buff....I've done the camo challenges for it already. But the exploits. HELL YES FIX THEM!!!!!
CodAW,3c081u,elmo4234,-8,Sat Jul 4 05:26:19 2015 UTC,The MK14 is fine. Its definitely a viable weapon now. If you aim for the head you can just melt people. Everytime I use it I have no problems going positive. Now the AMR9 on the other hand...
CodAW,3c081u,Terkey,2,Fri Jul 3 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"AMR9 is awesome, people don't realize its true power. It melts at close range and has very low recoil because of its bursts.  Try it out with ext mags, rapid fire, adv rifling. Outlaw and Hipshot are good variants. They need to fix the Dynamo and Pro Pipe burst delay though"
CodAW,3c081u,icedblackcoffee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:10:27 2015 UTC,"Outlaw is literally the worst variant. Pro-pipe is supposed to have a slower burst delay, but it makes up for it with that 33 mid range damage."
CodAW,3c081u,elmo4234,-1,Fri Jul 3 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, maybe thats why. I only used the pro pipe. Thanks for the tips man. Its my last gun to Submachine royalty."
CodAW,3c081u,icedblackcoffee,2,Fri Jul 3 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"No it's not fine. It needs its 1.1 chest and neck multiplier changed to a 1.5 torso and neck multiplier in exchange for 200 less centerspeed. That way it can 2 body shot kill at close range and 3 body shot at mid and long range.  They should also rework the epm3 into a true marksman rifle by:   changing the damage back to 34-34-33, add a 1.5 torso and neck multiplier, and decrease the centerspeed by 250. make the exterminator 39-34-33, the -1dmg variants 34-34-24, and the -2 damage variants 34-33-24.   That way the epm3 wouldn't be useless after a mk14 buff and would have a decent 2hk range, but would have enough recoil that it wouldn't be abusable unless you use the bonafide variant, which would have the same 2 body shot kill range as the mk14.  As for the amr9. I actually think it's very underrated. I use the pro-pipe and even that is good. The best thing for the amr9 would be nerfs to the asm1 and Bal:   20-30% more recoil for the asm1. Basically make it so that the normal variant has close to or as much recoil as the current strider recoil. This would make the asm1 still beastly at close range, but would make it falter at long range and would make the speakeasy's firerate a double edged sword. 10-15% more recoil on the bal27. This would discourage bal use a little and make the obsidian steed's increased recoil more detrimental and make the inferno's fire rate something that requires mastery."
CodAW,3c081u,_swamp,2,Fri Jul 3 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with your first point. I spent a lot of time with the EPM3 and started figuring out how to play with the semi-autos in this game. After I switched to the MK14, it was much better. It just requires very good accuracy and quick reaction, as well as a fast trigger finger, to be able to fully utilize it. You pretty much have to get out three or four shots on target before the guy jumps because then it's going to go sour. It also takes being in the right places and playing a bit slower (not camping, just more conservative traversal of the map). I've actually come to enjoy it quite a bit but the reward isn't worth the risk if your goal is to always be the top of your team. I managed to finish up my last 50-something longshots and 25 or so headshots in a couple of evenings worth of playing because I finally got in the rhythm. Now the EPM3 and MK14 are some of my favorite guns for bigger maps. Hitting the right parts of the body is crucial, though. You won't get away with hitting someone in the legs at medium range against pretty much any other gun very often. It's got to be the chest or head.  I disagree on the AMR9. I love that gun now. I use the Shorty and can have some great games. It's a lot of fun to use and the buffs that they applied were just about perfect for what the gun needed. It's probably the most fun SMG in the game, in my opinion, especially because there aren't many people using them. The only thing they need to do it is fix the variant(s) that somehow didn't get the burst delay buff that all of the others got. That's a pretty ridiculous oversight.  I'm pretty happy with the overall balance. Aside from the overused ASM1/Bal/HBRa Insanity that throw it off, guns fit pretty well in a particular niche. The pistols are atrocious, though. I'd be happy with just a pistol buff and some sort of incentive to get people to stop relying on those three so much, but I don't see the last part happening without some nerfs."
