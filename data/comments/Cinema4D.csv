Physics error - chain clipping through exhaust.    (Apologies for the horrendous quality, I was in a hurry).     Given the scope and amount of vfx shots in modern films, I can accept small errors that the general public would likely not notice.     I do love when films include nods to any vfx artists watching the film though, such as the photogrammetry reference in the hallway projection scene in MI: Ghost Protocol; where the projection adjusts in realtime based on facial tracking.  Here they talk about the scene @57:30 on the VFX Show #140."

Cinema4D,3e1yzb,KickingDolls,3,Tue Jul 21 09:46:11 2015 UTC,Dude I'm totally with you on this.. I've been using C4D for quite a while now too and the whole UV thing has always bugged me. I've chatted to Maya ops in my department and I still don't really get it. It also seems to be rather a pain and over complicated going through the motions in Bodypaint as oppose to other 3D programs.  There was a pretty good tutorial on school of Motion I think which I've tried watching a few times but then it's not something I have to do on a daily basis and it all goes again. Hey if it works by bodging .... what the hell eh?
Cinema4D,3e1yzb,geemachine,2,Tue Jul 21 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"I guess the issue I have with bodging (and don't get me wrong, I'm quite the bodger) is that I see some pretty complex models made from time to time (I.E http://i.imgur.com/GmxyYCy.jpg) and I'm painfully aware that to get to this level of detail it's often easier to work on a textural level, as opposed to geometry.  And that's when it becomes very useful to start being able to make good unwraps.  Plus, I kind of hate having to constantly tile my textures and then trying my best to find a point that's not too noticeable for the seams...  Glad I'm not alone here."
Cinema4D,3e1yzb,2visible,2,Tue Jul 21 10:56:13 2015 UTC,"same here. i tried to understand the workflow, but it seems that there was always a matter of luck. i switched to modo, now it's a breeze - but it took some time to really feel comfortable, luckily there are many good and thorough tutorials."

Cinema4D,3e1yzb,demiankz,4,Tue Jul 21 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"Literally exactly why I'm doing this tutorial as we speak. I've been doing C4D since 2008 and managed to get pretty good at most aspects with the exception of UVs. I think specifically because it's so easy to fudge it in other ways. Lighting's a big factor but being able to get more accurate and specific with materials would be a godsend.  Hopefully it should cast some light on UV unwrapping, but it's already shown me some slightly more advanced modeling techniques, good general practices, features I wasn't aware of, etc. I almost wish I'd done it two years ago.... heh...."

I just upgraded my CPU which makes the Interactive Preview Render window work almost in real-time.   They've got a 30 day trial version on the solid angle site you should check out.

Also, there's not really a lot of depth to your scene. It looks like you just took a BG image and blurred it (which is fine), while in reality, some areas of the image would be less blurred than other areas because of their actual depth in the scene. But honestly, the whole thing looks pretty good. The snail looks realistic and well modeled/rendered, and the background image fits the scene."

Rotate your tub so it's facing slightly screen right instead of screen left. Tada! http://imgur.com/SfNJWWJ Also, ask yourself, ""is this the right aspect ratio for this image""?  But if you wanted to take this to the next level, it wouldn't be hard to put it into an environment...  Grab a nice timber texture to make a countertop. Eg http://www.cgtextures.com/textures.php?t=browse&q=14119  Throw an appropriate HDRI background onto a sky object. Eg http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html  Use some GI along with the physical renderer with a fairly narrow depth of field (BG out of focus, hopefully some nice bokeh)  Post effects! Adjust contrast in the luma and saturation (per rgb channel). Relighting with huge gradients and blend modes. Add some subtle optical effects (glows, flares) dodge tool is your friend. But be subtle! Add some grain and sharpening.  Once you've done all this, you can go back to cinema and start adding extra 3D elements to help sell the scene. Little extras help so much. Suprememoves suggestion to deform the mesh is really excellent advice! (FFD deformer should get you there). Also, DarkFlite's condensation idea was great!   Final advice: Just keep going, even if it feels like you should have been finished days ago, just keep going on this one image- all the tricks you learn along the way will take you half the time on the next image and half again on the next."

Having the knowledge you do of blender, and trying to recreate it in c4d would be a start and from there its wherever you artistic endeavour takes you.  Certainly adding another bit of software to your toolset can only help, and will help you realise very quickly that its just a tool. Once you are clear on what it is you are trying to achieve and know how to vocalise any issues you may come across using terminology that is pretty much universal to all software, the Chosen software you use will become secondary. This forum is very helpful in answering question i have noticed.  Give it a go, it certainly cant hurt."

If you'd like to get your feet wet before you have access to the program, check out some tutorials at greyscalegorilla.com. Blender is a great resource and I think you'll find the crossover to C4D to be fairly smooth."
Cinema4D,3dlkry,absolutelybatty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:34 2015 UTC,"I think C4d's biggest advantage is that it integrates well with After Effects and is good for motion graphics. But if you're not interested in that sort of thing, I would imagine Blender is good enough."

Cinema4D,3dksnc,AnsenPhotos,2,Fri Jul 17 01:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that your faces are rendering out as truly transparent because we can't see any of the structure on the other side through them.  I would venture to say its a material issue but what I would do is but a Compositing Tag on the faces and setting an Object Buffer on that and doing a Multipass Rendering so you can have that as a matte. I would use that matte in Photoshop to bring the background back in.  There should be someway of fixing the material issue within the render but if it were happening to me, I would just start poking at it. I would mess around with your transparency settings first."
Cinema4D,3dksnc,dondox,2,Fri Jul 17 02:48:43 2015 UTC,"Just throwing it in there: Maybe to do with ambient occlusion? That was a problem for me (AO would cause trouble with transparent parts). Fix it by putting a Compositing tag on the transparent parts and then uncheck 'Seen by AO' in the tag settings.  I also had a problem with Alpha channels in combination with Depth of Field (normal DoF, not physical).  Or maybe put the photo in C4D directly (Background object).  Good luck!"
Cinema4D,3dj6xe,ElGuapoBeardo,3,Thu Jul 16 18:25:55 2015 UTC,I think your best bet is to do this in post using a material id buffer combined with an illumination map.   The illumination map will show what is being lit by your lights.  Use the material id (white where your material is and black everywhere else) to mask the illumination map which should only show you the illumination of the reflective material. You can then use that to apply a glow and so on so forth.  Does that make sense?

Cinema4D,3dizqb,Saddex,3,Thu Jul 16 17:34:54 2015 UTC,AE doesn't use the GPU for rendering yet. So it is behaving as expected.

Cinema4D,3dizqb,sageofshadow,5,Thu Jul 16 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify - Cineware uses the Cinema4D render engines for the C4D layers, regardless of the fact that its 'inside' AE.... and none of the native engines in Cinema use GPU acceleration. Sahrry."
Cinema4D,3dizqb,sageofshadow,2,Thu Jul 16 18:06:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarification.  Yes, I will need a CPU upgrade regardless.

An eight-core 5960X would have done the job, but now I don't have the budget."
Cinema4D,3dizqb,sageofshadow,2,Thu Jul 16 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"Well all hope isnt lost.   August 9-13 this year is the Siggraph Conference & Exhibition, thats almost always when Maxon unveils the new version of Cinema. Just under a month away. and R17 miiiiiiight have a native GPU accelerated engine. You never know! :)"
Cinema4D,3dizqb,bcarmeli,2,Thu Jul 16 18:21:57 2015 UTC,Well I hope they have. Shame really that they didn't include that earlier.
Cinema4D,3dizqb,sageofshadow,2,Thu Jul 16 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"*shrugs* I think there's a tonne of factors that went in to it not being done yet, TBH. First, things take time to make. As much of a hot ticket it is right now, production grade GPU rendering is still pretty new.... the last time Maxon updated the rendering system, Vray was the shit, everyone was saying ""use Vray""..... now only 2 years later, its all about Octane. Vray has been kinda left by the wayside. So its popularity rise hasnt really been that long..... Then people forget: Octane has been nvidia only, and is only adding OpenCL support later this year..... and Maxon doesnt strike me as an exclusive kind of company. I dont think they wouldve brought out a GPU engine that everyone couldnt use, which means it needed to be primarily OpenCL based... but OpenCL just hasnt been developed as well or aggressively supported as CUDA has.  Even Cycles - Blender's GPU engine - only got critical patches from AMD this april to make the OpenCL/AMD implementation as semi-useable as the CUDA/Nvidia implementation, which was solid from the get-go.   either way, i dont think them not having a GPU engine is particularly affecting them negatively. People who really want or need GPU rendering have that option available in a selection of relatively inexpensive 3rd party plugins, and nobody is really buying Max or Maya over Cinema because it doesnt have GPU implementation... remember... those are the people Maxon is competing against. not plugin manufacturers like Octane or Vray. TBH i dont think max or maya come with a GPU engine standard either... only the viewport is accelerated with ""quicksilver"" or whatever they call it, IIRC. but hey I could be wrong.  Anyway.....Id rather them do it right, than rush it, just to say they have it. If that means august, or another year cookin, or longer still, then thats what it means *shrugs*   there I go again.....sorry about the ramble! I dunno when to shaddup sometimes. O.o"

Cinema4D,3dizqb,digitalpizza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:43 2015 UTC,3DKiwi has stated that one of the reasons that he is leaving c4 for modo has to do with him being disappointed in some of the things he's seen in the R17 preview he's received.   This could mean a lack of Bodypaint 3D improvements as that's been a personal interest of his for some time. I'd imagine if there were GPU implementation he wouldn't have made such a public departure but obviously this is all speculative.   Fingers crossed for something really great though!

I prefer not to hang alot on Kiwi's ""departure"" ... but that might just be because I never hung out at C4Dcafe, so I dont really know who he was other than the dude that ran that forum. I say, more power to him if Modo is where he wants to devote more of his time. I always say programs are a tool, and Artists change gears all the time, for tonnes of different reasons.   and even if r17 is disappointing, its still Cinema. and I still enjoy using it :)"

I'm also fairly invested in the Arnold renderer at the moment so while GPU integration would be really great, it might still not be enough to pull me away   Will be really interesting to see what Maxon has in store"

I got 3 versions: One just static, the second is xpresso driven (turret/guns/tracks etc.) and the last with fully dynamic track.  I still have to change the wheels and tracks so they are more in scale with the rest. And ofcourse the materials and textures.

Instances of team render server dont talk to each other.   youre supposed to manage team render through the web interface, with the address to the one server. then youll see the same list no matter what computer you bring the web interface up on.   so lets say computer 1 has team render server, connected to computers 2 and 3.   when you launch the web interface from within the team render server dialog box on computer 1..... it might be:   http://localhost:8080 or 127.0.0.1:8080 or somthing.    but on the other machines the address should be   http://computer1.address:8080 or 192.168.X.X:8080    (or however youve configured your ports) and it will bring up Computer 1's render server and job queue.   if you open another instance of team render server, and launch the web interface from within the dialog box.... lets say on computer 2, its going to have its own address and job list.... because the address will be   http://computer2.address:8080   which will bring up computer2's render server and job list, not computer 1. also, the user profiles are unique to each server, so just cause youre logged into admin on both, its not really the same user. its (computer1 server) admin, and (computer2 server) admin.   the point is, instances of team render server dont talk to each other. theyre not designed that way. they talk only to clients. if you want to see the same list, use only 1 instance of team render server and access the web interface on any other computer like youre putting in a website. just use the ip address of the computer that's running the server.   If you want, you can go the extra mile too and port-forward the team render server port (default 8080), set up somthing like noip (if you dont have a static ip) and then be able to launch the web interface over the internet from outside of the office.

I think if the cloth actually made the shape of the rigid logo before the transition, it would work a lot better. as it stands, its just a pretty cool looking flappy cloth.... and then your logo kinda drops in. i think you just need to relate them together a bit more, and youll get your idea across alot better.   but hey!! thats totally just my opinon, which you totally dont need to listen to at all :D   i'm just tryin to help. :)"

Cinema4D,3d77ni,youprobablythinkthis,3,Tue Jul 14 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"What you want amounts to having your 3d cake and eating it, too!  Rigged animation and point morphs are done on low-poly meshes.  If you've spent time painting weights, you can appreciate that even low-poly meshes can be very tedious and finicky to get right went it comes to rigging.  So there's a tremendous value in figuring out your displacement and bump workflow so that you can use a subdivision modifier.  Something people often don't realize is that you don't have to create a low-poly version of the entire model.  Maybe just the eyes or mouth or hands are going to be animated in the shot.  For coarse deformations, there's creating a cage (like sage's GSG tute) and deforming that.  There's also using deformers with falloff.  Be forewarned, applying modifiers on multi-million vertex models can be nightmarishly slow."

Is there a reason you wouldn't be able to bake out normal or even displacement maps of your high poly model and then apply it to the retopo'd one? Again, not too much personal experience but that was my understanding of how those animations were typically achieved"
Cinema4D,3d77ni,Lazores,2,Tue Jul 14 05:05:34 2015 UTC,"I guess that would be the correct way to do it, but I wasn't really thinking ahead with this project because I wanted to just sculpt in zbrush, and animating it was sort of an after thought thing. I didn't want to spend a ton of time on the retopo, so I just remeshed at a lower subdivision level with hints from the topology brush, and now I have no UV coordinates on my low poly model. But yeah, a smart person would just do it like that, baking out the normal maps and such."

I'm mid-level in my field, and have bills to pay, so I couldn't take a significant pay cut, even for something fun like 3D.  I am, however, working on getting some 3D stuff into my job description. I work for a university, so if just have to talk them into buying me an educational license for C4D for my work machine. :)"

Cinema4D,3d0xw1,DasFroDo,3,Sun Jul 12 16:34:13 2015 UTC,I'm having troubles understanding what you are doing but I think I have a solution: make two cloners.
Cinema4D,3d0xw1,dondox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"Basically I want the cloner to only create the ""hull"" clones, not the entire filling of the volume. I don't need those since they are inside of the big cube anyways.  I'm not sure if that's still relevant now, but what do you mean with using two cloners?"
Cinema4D,3d0xw1,dondox,3,Sun Jul 12 16:59:53 2015 UTC,How about cloner set to object and stick your big cube in there
Cinema4D,3d0xw1,dondox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:03:45 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I did now!   See here  Thanks a lot!

Cinema4D,3d0xw1,cheesyvee,2,Sun Jul 12 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"Have you tried to use object mode in the cloner? change the distribution to poly center, edge, or whatever. Many, many fewer clones.   You may have to make another version of the building, and make cuts/edges where you want them to be. But that's like 5 minute of extra work, so not too bad. Then use the new ""building"" and the object source for the cloner."
Cinema4D,3d0xw1,sageofshadow,2,Sun Jul 12 17:02:34 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I did. Thanks a lot! No idea why I didn't think of that before. Probably worked with C4D for too long today.   Sometimes you can't find the easiest solution that is right in your face...
Cinema4D,3d0xw1,dondox,2,Sun Jul 12 17:25:31 2015 UTC,I've found I do my best thinking in the shower. I hand placed 7000 objects the other day and now I need to replace them with instances...  Took a shower this AM and omg I'm a total idiot. Cloner.   I still have to place the multiple cloners etc. but we're talking ~1 hour vs replacing all of my work or figuring out a python work around.
Cinema4D,3d0xw1,dmstudio,2,Sun Jul 12 23:49:04 2015 UTC,"(Continuing from /u/dondox - whose suggestion would work)   Or 4 cloners, one for each building face, and connect the attributes you need to control in xpresso.  Or 1, using object mode and polygon or vertex distribution with a subdivided cube as the object. You could even make it editable, delete the top so it doesn't clone faces up there, break the edges and stick it in a subdiv surface. That will give you a lot of control over the density too.   Or you could do it - clone a cloner using a Rectangle spline with an even distribution.   I could go on. (Sorry! I ramble.) there are tonnes of ways to clone stuff on the 'outside' of a rectangle. I'm on my mobile at the moment though, so I can't really mock any up for you to see. But hopefully you got the gist of it."

Cinema4D,3cxmf8,GrungeRockGerbil,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:34:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't spent much time in the physical renderer (i started learning c4d several months ago and started off with vRay) but from what I can tell the jump isn't huge at all. The biggest difference is probably dealing with a different materials setup, and more options for lighting and camera effects. I would highly recommend it.  I come from a photography background, so lighting has always been the most important thing for me. vRay gives me most of the options that actually shooting a roomset in real life would give me."
Cinema4D,3cxmf8,GrungeRockGerbil,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"I've watched a handful of vray tuts and the one thing that always surprises me is how simple the lighting can seem. That's probably due to my ignorance, but it's amazing to me when someone comes back and says ""oh yeah, that's just a vray physical sky or dome light or whatever""  Is there a ton of tweaking of settings or is it really that simple?  Thanks for the reply btw"
Cinema4D,3cxmf8,mattdezine,2,Sat Jul 11 18:55:27 2015 UTC,"Hey. I've been using Vray for about 2 years and the biggest boon with using it, i would say, is that ""it just works"" right outa the box. The pages of render setting and material options can be a bit daunting, but the defaults can usually get what you need. Then once you get a better handle on the minutia, you can really dial in some amazingly detailed looks."
Cinema4D,3cxmf8,dmstudio,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:00:14 2015 UTC,"It is very simple, you should give it a shot. You don't need to do a ton of tweaking to get a good looking render."

No floor, no BG, just the simplest scene, one light.  Vray looked way more natural for some reason, the bump map and the falloff of the light as well as the coloration.  Maybe with some tweaking I could make them both look the same but just right off the bat V-Ray was better."

Are you using GI? because if you are - its probably GI flicker. there are lots of different ways to get rid of GI flicker, but the best way is to not use GI, especially when you dont neeeeed it, and light your scene without it.   Otherwise check out GSGs new vids, im pretty sure he talks about getting flicker free GI animations in one of them.   but seriously, I would go the route of learning how to light without GI."
Cinema4D,3cu1za,sageofshadow,2,Fri Jul 10 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"I do use GI. Since I don't have much time nor experience, I naïvely thought this would be a quick and easy way to get things done... I will take a look at GSGs videos. Thanks!"
Cinema4D,3cu1za,sageofshadow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"yeeahh... GI is definately neither quick nor easy if you dont really know how it works or what it's doing.   if you havent - check out the GSG intro to cinema series, its in the sidebar under ""i'm new, where do i start?""   Its worth going through if youre really new... cause he teaches you all the basics you might need to know, as well as the jargon and some of the technical stuff, so you really have a solid understanding of the basics. :)   Good Luck!"
Cinema4D,3cu1za,Edo75,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:08:53 2015 UTC,There is a preset in C4D to limit GI flickering but it's hell slow. I recommend to not use GI with animation or use a 3rd party renderer.

Obviously, I'd like what you guys think, feel free to say that the animation is crap if you think that it is, but give me a reason why :) Please... Don't break my tinny animator hearth."
Cinema4D,3cu1h0,sageofshadow,2,Fri Jul 10 19:48:09 2015 UTC,"its not bad for a beginner!   there's alot of stuff you could work on, but thats all general. just keep making and you'll get better. I'll give you some feedback to keep in mind for your next animations:   try to get some more variety in the animations... right now youre using that same polyfx-ish looking animation to animate ""on"" alot of the stuff in the scene. but it gets a bit repetitive after a while. try a different thing, or use the same effect differently. just experiment! a little visual variety helps alot.  now, even though i said to have variety in the animations.... you want consistency in your style. Right now, you have some conflicting styles.... the clouds are low-poly, but the helicopter and trees are not. you want to be consistent with that kinda stuff. In this case, I would recommend going and changing the clouds to not be low-poly. if youre wondering what to do with them, just look up some 3d cartoon clouds, and youll get an idea of what fits.    There are some other things i could comment on, but I think you got enough to think about for next time.   as for this:    Please... Don't break my tinny animator hearth.   you gotta remember, this is alllllll subjective. someone may come in and rip it apart, but that's their subjective opinion. don't take it personally... try to filter out the root of the criticism, read between the lines to see what theyre really trying to address, and see if its something you agree with. This part really just takes practice. once you start doing professional work, youll find that its a really good skill to have. because when a client says something like ""its not happy enough"", you can filter what they really mean and address it. and one day, youll have to deal with someone or people who just dont like what you made. try to let it roll off you.   anyway thats enough rambling from me! keep making stuff and we'll keep trying to help you improve ;)"
Cinema4D,3cuh32,Saddex,2,Fri Jul 10 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"There's a bunch ways to do this:  Copy your TV and apply your 2nd texture. put a 'display tag' (Cinema 4D Tags > Dispay ) on the first tv and animate the 'visibiliy' from 100% to 0% over 2 frames - this will make it disappear. Do the same for your second tv but in reverse so it goes from 0% to 100%. This will make it appear and create a switch effect from TV 1 to TV 2.  or  You can animate the 'Seen by camera' control in the compositing tag but you wont have feedback in the view port until you render.  or  Just animate the 'Visible in Editor' & 'Visible in Renderer' in the 'Basic' tab of any object.  or  Drop your objects into a linear cloner, set the count to one, reset the 'y movement' to 0,  and then animate the 'index' and watch it cycle through all the the objects inside the cloner."
Cinema4D,3cskml,EducationUmbrella,4,Fri Jul 10 12:55:06 2015 UTC,Make sure you get the version that suits your needs. Prime is the entry level version. Check comparison chart :  http://www.maxon.net/products/general-information/general-information/product-comparison.html
Cinema4D,3cskml,Mind_the_gap_ok,2,Fri Jul 10 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"This.  To get the stuff most people care about using C4D for like the Mograph suite, you have to have Broadcast or Studio.  I wouldn't recommend Prime to anyone.  After you buy a full version, though, you can get the Maxon Service Agreement which costs £440.00 per year for Studio (others are less) and you get whatever updates that come out in that year (usually they do a new version every year)."
Cinema4D,3cskml,BanjiWaYume,3,Fri Jul 10 20:52:08 2015 UTC,I think it might be the price if you'll buy 5 or more licenses.  The cheapest one is £600.  http://www.maxonshop.co.uk/full-versions-30-c.asp

Cinema4D,3cskml,sageofshadow,5,Fri Jul 10 13:09:14 2015 UTC,"Non floating licence means you can install it on one machine. However, I'm pretty sure I read they allow two installations - one on a desktop, one on a laptop - but do not allow concurrent uses.   I.E. you cant use both your desktop and laptop installation at the same time. Or, if you bought 5 non-floating licences for an office, you can install it on 5 computers, and only those 5 computers can use cinema.   If you buy a floating licence, it requires a licence server. What that means is instead of installing and storing the licence information locally, all the licences are stored on a central server. Then you can install cinema on as many computers as you want. when one computer opens an instance of cinema, it checks the licence server for open licences.   I.E> If you buy 5 floating licences you can install Cinema on 15 (or any number) of computers in an office, and any 5 computers can use it at the same time. as one computer closes it, another can open it, but only 5 can be open at the same time.   so yeah. /u/stereomachine is right, the cheapest single user license is prime at £600.   that all being said   If I were you, id wait if i could. Siggraph (August 9-13 this year) is usually when they announce the new version of Cinema - and it almost always comes with a deal. Which is almost always the inclusion of an MSA with the price of purchase, which is a pretty good deal. So if you can wait a month, it would probably be worth it."

Cinema4D,3cosae,bcarmeli,2,Thu Jul 9 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"I have been messing with it since it hit public beta and it's pretty cool.  You can create an effect (asset) in Houdini then use the engine to load it as a tool inside of Cinema4d to interact with C4d objects.  For example, I don't care for the X-Particles skinner (mesher) so I created an asset that meshes Thinking Particles as openVDB to get a better result.  You just drag the TP group into the Asset parameter and boom.  Watch Noseman's videos to get a better idea of how the engine works.  It's pretty awesome if you want some of the power of Houdini but want to keep your Cinema4d workflow."
Cinema4D,3cosae,thesneakyD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:44:39 2015 UTC,"Another way to look at it is you can either spend 1000 bucks on plugins for Cinema4d then pay for upgrades every year or you can spend 199 on Houdini that does pretty much everything you would need once a year.  Having said that though, there is a bigger learning curve obviously and some of the C4d plugins are worth it.  Specifically X-Particles."
Cinema4D,3cosae,thesneakyD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:47:33 2015 UTC,"Got the plugin to work after some struggle.

Cinema4D,3cosae,Mind_the_gap_ok,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:31:11 2015 UTC,Maybe it depends on the computer. I can easily run a real-time rigid-body simulation in c4d without any caching. But in houdini it's half speed.

If i were to criticize something it would be the reflectivity of things, specially the floor. Its the only thing i feel stands out from the rest of the things in the image.  Other than that, really inspirational stuff and smart techniques!"
Cinema4D,3cknlu,Lazores,2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:34 2015 UTC,Thank you! And good call on the floor. I do have a habit of wanting to pull those reflections and speculars out of everything.
Cinema4D,3cknlu,stroginof,2,Wed Jul 8 18:15:42 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could use sketch & toon to get similar looks to your photoshop files. That would allow you to make an animation in that style by rendering a multipass file & comping everything in AE.  Great work regardless
Cinema4D,3cknlu,stroginof,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:24:04 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, but the time to tweak those shaders, fine tune the lighting and optimize the render would far exceed the budget for one still, me thinks."
Cinema4D,3cknlu,opst02,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:42:02 2015 UTC,"for one still, for paid client work, yes absolutely. You made the right call.   But if you do this kind of thing regularly, I'd think taking the time to build a preset sketch & toon setup once so that animation is a possibility down the road would only allow you to do better work & charge even more next time :)  EDIT Or hey, I guess you could always build photoshop actions and do each frame kindof assembly line style too. IDK which would be easier at this point"
Cinema4D,3clc7j,potiongraphics,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"At work i do a workaround. The company bought some really high poly models of cars, and rigging and animating them is a hassle.   So i took the chassis, and ran it through a poly reduction deformer so i get a lowpoly (though ugly) version of it.  Then i chose in the hierarchy to not show the highpoly in in the editor, and not show the lowpoly in the render  (you can do that by either using the two small buttons next to where the tags on the object is or going to the basic tab on the object attributes)"
Cinema4D,3clc7j,Lazores,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"You can set proxys (xrefs) in cinema as well so your scene uses say a box in place of your high poly object and then toggle your proxys on for final render.   The benefit of this is that your high poly models are their own c4d files, so they won't bog down your scene."
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,cookehMonstah,2,Wed Jul 8 16:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, hardwire every node you can.   Team Render uses a BitTorrent-esque protocol to distribute assets from node to node. What this means is each node gets a piece of the data from the ""server"" and then they share it amongst themselves, this is brutal on your network throughput at the immediate beginning of the process but quickly smooths out. If you feel like the bulk of when the process is slowed down is in the beginning when each node is ""downloading assets"" (check the console on the team render client program on each node) then this would indicate a network bottleneck.   I've monitored network traffic on our work network and when I hit render, the traffic spike can be as high as 100MB/s on just two nodes. If you are working with really large HDRI's and lots of heavy scenes, where the project file+image assets can exceed 1GB then you really can benefit from network improvements."
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,HONEST_ABE_APPROVES,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"We don't have nodes, just four workstations.   But yeah judging from the other responses hardwiring everything seems like a good investment."
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,renderkingfarm,2,Fri Jul 10 08:47:00 2015 UTC,"yes a gigabit switch will help a lot, even fast wifi is probably more like 100baseT and still much higher latency and dropouts. also many areas are now saturated with wifi signals which means depending on what channel you are using could be significantly affecting your throughput. and again, many wi-fi routers will step down to the slowest item connected so depending on what wi-fi level you are using G? N? A? B?  you could really be running much slower then you realize and it could vary/alter itself if it does continue to drop/adjust to the slowest protocol selected.  get a gigabit switch, it will help tremendously and literally should be plug and play - just turn of the wifi or make sure you are connecting over the wired port!"
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,stroginof,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:57:56 2015 UTC,"I saw that indeed, we have four render workstations. When I render on the workstations nearby they start rather fast, but when I connect the other two it can take approx 20 seconds.   TBH I don't know what wifi level we are on, but a gigabyte switch seems like a good investment (they are not that expensive, and it will speed up dropbox syncing too.)  Thanks for the advice man."
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,TheGreatSzalam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:45:57 2015 UTC,"Possibly slightly, but the amount of data that one finished render bucket takes up is so small, that I really don't think the network is your bottleneck"
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,stroginof,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"It would slow down the start of the render as it transfers all of the scene assets over the network, so there's that.   Also, if they're rendering animations, it has to transfer the whole image and not just buckets. If it's a crappy wifi network with a lot of traffic, it might be an issue.  But, in general, you're probably right. Network speed is unlikely to hamper anything depending on scale."
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,TheGreatSzalam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:32:01 2015 UTC,"I think it still transfers buckets, you just don't see them in your render preview"
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,stroginof,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:05:33 2015 UTC,It renders a frame at a time and transfers each frame as it completes. I found that out when Team Render had all those bugs when it first replaced Net Render...
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,TheGreatSzalam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"even so, how much time does a single finished frame take to transfer over shitty wifi? My guess is a lot shorter than it takes to render the next frame"
Cinema4D,3ckbo9,renderkingfarm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:57:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much traffic there is and how crappy the wifi is. But yes, as I said, in most cases, it's really only the startup that would be slowed down."

You'll probably need to bring the uvs across in a different way though, think I ended up having the Maya guy export an obj as well, imported that and dragged it's uv tag onto my cached model, then the textures say on it fine."
Cinema4D,3cirvk,KickingDolls,2,Wed Jul 8 07:00:19 2015 UTC,"You're doing things the opposite way from what I usually see. Most times I see a Maya-C4D workflow, they've animated in Maya and are rendering in C4D!"

Cinema4D,3chy0l,dashzed,7,Wed Jul 8 01:23:56 2015 UTC,"Well there aren't a ton of tools you don't have access to if you're aware of scripts and/or plugins. The biggest things I can think of from R13 and onwards you don't have natively in R12 - and an aftermarket alternative/equivalent listed as follows:  Bevel Deformer - Chamfer Maker  Snapping - HB Modelling Toolkit, among many  Solo - Nitro3D Magic Solo  Revamped Global Illumination/Physical Render - Any third party renderer, VRay, Arnold, Maxwell (specifically omitting GPU renderers)  Sculpting - ZBrush + GoZ plugin (although this is entirely separate software and is more fully featured for organic surface scultping, there isn't a quick replacement for smoothing geo in a pinch).  What you don't have is the revamped reflectance channel shaders for the native C4D shaders, but this entire system pulled a page out of VRay's book. The motion tracking system can be handy, but there are a multitude of outside tracking programs that can get this job done.   I am sure other people can list other features you may not have, but honestly there should be third party solutions for nearly everything (or else Maxon probably wouldn't have developed and implemented said feature) but there is a lot of value to having many of these tools natively built into the software.   EDIT: Team Render is nice if you have a stable setup of computers and don't need to mess with it after you get it running.

Cinema4D,3chdfu,Onanino,11,Tue Jul 7 22:38:00 2015 UTC,It's usually announced in August and released in September.  I hate that because my MSA runs out at the end of July so I have to upgrade without knowing what new features are coming.  It better not be another new cog wheel.
Cinema4D,3chdfu,thesneakyD,13,Tue Jul 7 23:05:01 2015 UTC,hopefully it will have a GPU based built in renderer. the pipe dream speculation starts soon too.
Cinema4D,3chdfu,wellitsbouttime,4,Tue Jul 7 23:57:38 2015 UTC,We can only guess and hope.  I will say Maxon does a good job of not leaking -any- information...
Cinema4D,3chdfu,thesneakyD,3,Wed Jul 8 00:06:00 2015 UTC,This will be the difference between me putting $300 into a CPU or GPU. I want to learn Octane but I'm too lazy to learn it.
Cinema4D,3chdfu,Zarzuh,3,Wed Jul 8 03:46:21 2015 UTC,"I find an increasing amount of products start supporting cuda and opencl rendering, like element 3d, adobe products, octane and other renderers, and turbulence fd. At work we have 8 i7 based render farm machines, and I use them less and less. The return on investment when buying gpu's is just that much higher. Of course, it depends on your setup and type of work, but I recommend everyone to try it out. I used to think rendering setup was a chore, now it's fun! Regarding Maxon having their own GPU based render solution, I'm waiting until I get to try Octane cloud rendering. Saving as .orbx and rendering anything in minutes will be a blast!"
Cinema4D,3chdfu,wellitsbouttime,2,Wed Jul 8 09:28:19 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way. I know I can get faster renders if I learn octane, but no current break in production schedules.   you can't really put just 300 in to a cpu. those upgrades are in the 1000s, but a slick top of the line gpu would cost about half that. I've got a superclocked 980 I just haven't taken advantage of it. :/"
Cinema4D,3chdfu,wellitsbouttime,3,Wed Jul 8 03:57:17 2015 UTC,"I just jumped into it, and I find learning while doing actual work speeds up the process :). Also, Octane is rather well implemented.

Cinema4D,3cd91k,mkmkmk13,3,Tue Jul 7 00:30:09 2015 UTC,"You can populate an object's surface with objects using the Cloner tool. Set the mode to Object and drag your hill geometry into the Object field. You can then set the Distribution, Seed, and Count. If I'm doing this with trees, I'll usually uncheck 'Align Clone' so they don't rotate to the angle of the plane.  You should then use a Random Effector to create variance in scale and rotation. A bit of height and scale difference will add -heaps- to this scene.  You can also add some subtle variation to the tree colours by using the Random Effector and Mograph Multi Shader.  In terms of what you should be looking for with object placement, try to grouping or clumping objects together. As a general rule of thumb, one large object (a big tree), several medium-sized objects (small trees, shrubs, rocks), and lots of small objects (pebbles, grass, small flowers). This will create a more natural looking scene.  You could also consider changing your lighting somewhat. Your shadows are very hard and dark, and, because the light is overhead, they muddy up the silhouette of your trees. Considering angling the light slightly, and reducing the shadow density and colour. I always like to avoid black shadows, so my trick is to add a luminance channel to any material and set the luminance colour to the very darkest colour I want my object to be. Eg, if I have green trees like yours, I'll set the luminance colour to a darker, slightly bluer green. This means it will never have that solid black shadow like you see on the underside of your tree foliage.  Hope that helps!"

Cinema4D,3caud6,argusromblei,2,Mon Jul 6 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"of all the 3rd party engines - I think Indigo is one of the most attractive. GPU accelerated, OpenCL compatible, unbiased, cheap(ish.). Why isnt it more popular?! Anyway.... Have you tried IndigoRT? How about a more detailed impression? I'm so curious."
Cinema4D,3caud6,sageofshadow,2,Mon Jul 6 16:06:58 2015 UTC,Octane is faster and cheaper.
Cinema4D,3caud6,-mr-tibbs-,2,Mon Jul 6 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"Arguably - No. it isnt. at least not right now. I've been thinking about this one for a while, and I'll tell you why I think so. You're very welcome to disagree, but this is just my thoughts on the matter.   On the surface: yes. Octane is cheaper! Obviously it has a lower number when you go to the ""buy me"" page. It costs 460Euro, which is about 500 US. on the flipside, Indigo is 835 US. So oooobviously: There's no way I can sit here and say Octane isn't cheaper. its $335 dollars cheaper!   but    (and this is where it gets interesting)   The price of the engine isnt the only price associated with Octane. For most people who want to use Octane and get all the speed that everyone talks about, it almost always involves the additional purchasing of an nVidia card - and not just any card - its usually a high end one (sometimes even two). like a 780Ti, or a 980 (or if youre really serious, a 980Ti or a TitanX). People buy these additional cards with all the CUDA cores they can, because Octane runs on only GPU power. Most of the cards I listed are +$550 for one... but the cards I usually see thrown around for ""octane use"" are more in the ~$700+ region. Because people recommend getting cards that have as much Vram as possible, and that doesnt come cheap.   So once you factor in the cost of purchasing an nvidia card to octane, the price isnt that cheap anymore... its more on par with other engines. Actually depending on what card you buy it can be wildly more expensive. So yeah I think when people say ""its cheaper!""...it feels misleading. because there's almost a minute asterisks footnote that says ""minus additional graphics card(s) you may want to buy to get the results we're all getting""   The thing that makes me think Indigo as being attractive is that:   you can use your CPU as well as Your GPU. So from the get go you arent required to buy a high end GPU to get some speedboost. And as C4D artists - most of us have invested in our CPU because that's what Cinema uses. So even though the engine is a little more expensive, its a more forgiving switch.  you dont need an nvidia card to get the GPU acceleration. which means people who have mac pros or amd cards can enjoy some GPU acceleration now too. which isnt something you can do with Octane.     Now - I know Octane has said ""Octane 3! AMD welcome! (possibly CPU as well!)"" but Indigo has also said ""Indigo 4! 100% GPU if you want! Still OpenCL based so everybody can Play equally!"" - not to mention: Indigo Devs said in a blog post that Apple has been helping them optimize the GPU engine for the Mac Pro. So again - it'll have to be weighed once the engines come out and the hype train dies down and hard reality sets in. who knows - maybe the OpenCL implementation of Octane will suck. its highly unlikely, but we wont know until its out.   And this also totally disregards the use of either (hence the reason I was asking /u/argusromblei for his opinion) - this is from an outsiders perspective looking in. I own neither of these engines and have used neither of them. I dont know if one is wayyy harder to learn and use than the other, or how buggy they are, or what the learning curve is like for a C4D user. I'm just commenting on it.   So yeah, once all the new stuff comes out, my opinion may change. but at the moment thats my thoughts. :)"
Cinema4D,3caud6,sageofshadow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"That was a very detailed post, but I have a problem with your fundamental argument.  Anyone who's working with Cinema 4D at any professional capacity is already going to have a decent card.  To add the cost of the card to the cost of the render is disingenuous.  That leaves Indigo charging an additional $300+ for CPU support.  While that's great, it's still more expensive, and still slower."
Cinema4D,3caud6,-mr-tibbs-,3,Mon Jul 6 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"perhaps - but decent card doesnt necessarily mean 'nvidia' or good for octane. Its just personal observation - most people who ask about purchasing octane in the sub do not own a octane-level card....   and from what people say, unless you do own one of those cards, the speed increase for final grain-free renders isnt excessively substantial over other engines with acceleration, like Indigo.   so its also a bit disingenuous to say its an extra $300 for CPU only, and its slower. Yes its an extra 300, but it isnt necessarily slower unless youve already invested in a good card for octane.... and on top of that you can use amd cards for acceleration. which you cant for octane right now.   I'm not saying octane is bad. I'm also not saying Indigo is ""better"". its not a octane vs indigo thing. Octane is amazing. I might buy it one day, if I decide to go pro. I'm just saying theres more to it than just saying ""Octane is cheaper and faster"" - because that might not be the case for everyone! And I'm just saying indigo intrigues me more than octane does at the moment for those reasons.   Thats all! To each his own right? :)"

Cinema4D,3caud6,argusromblei,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are some problems with it that keep it from being as good as Octane right now. At the moment the only difference between normal Indigo and RT is that it lets you do Pathtracing with GPU, but it is only accelerated, not 100% GPU like Octane, and it is limited to just Pathtracing which is like brute force unbiased. That would be great if you had some Titan X's or AMD Fury, but my HD 6870 renders slower than Bi-direction Pathtracing, and Bi-Dir is better for most things. So I just use RT to visualize what it would look like in C4D, then send it out to Indigo for normal CPU Pathtracing + Bi-Dir lighting. It is still fast, but will get slow when it doesn't have enough light in a scene, etc. Also the GPU pathtracing renders should look identical, but for me they look different, and not as good as the cpu Bi-Dir pathtracing. Indigo have announced in the next version it will have 100% pure GPU rendering, so it will be closer to Octane then, but Octane 3 will also be brand new with tons of awesome features. You could probably wait and choose either one when the new versions come out. I also haven't tried Octane's materials and lighting setup inside Cinema, but Indigo is very easy and powerful."

Cinema4D,3cabef,instantpancake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah as I said above, that stabilization in AE before tracking will do more harm than good for the solve.  If you're experiencing a lot of rolling shutter wobble, you can try to simply add more weight to the camera next time, and offset the center of gravity, in order to decrease the micro-rotation that comes with vibration. If you have some kind of photo tripod, for example, try mounting it under the camera, but don't extend or unfold the legs, but point them backwards, so you can press them against your shoulder like a gunstock. This should already go a long way.  Edit: Also, unless you go for the 4K version, Blackmagic cameras have pretty bad rolling shutters, too. :)"
Cinema4D,3cabef,stroginof,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:37:01 2015 UTC,Hmm. So footage needs to be really stablized? Like there can be almost no shake? Well lucky I bought I shoulder rig yesterday. That should help
Cinema4D,3cabef,Kylezar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"There can be shake. Fast movement is bad, and super small fast movement is worst.  The problem with CMOS sensors and their rolling shutters is that they read out the image gradually from top to bottom (or bottom to top). This process takes longer in cheap sensors found in consumer electronics. If the camera itself is very small and lightweight, it's subject to lots of vibration and micro-rotation around all axes when being hand-held. It's constantly moving, panning, tilting, and rolling a little, so to speak. If the sensor starts to read out the image at the top, while the camera is panning to the left (for example), the camera orientation at the begin of the read-out will be different from the orientation at the end of the read-out, resulting in a slightly skewed image (ever filmed telephone posts from a moving car with your phone? That's the same effect basically). While one axis alone would be relatively easy to correct for, a small handheld camera constantly rotates around every imaginable axis at the same time, at random speeds (very little of course, but that's enough). This results in pretty random distortions all over the frame, like looking through a block of jello. You can't really undo those once they're recorded.  So reduce vibration by increasing the mass of the camera, and get a better grip on it, away from its center of mass - a shoulder rig, or the aforementioned tripod trick. You won't completely defeat the rolling shutter artifacts, but you can keep them to a managable minimum for tracking."

Cinema4D,3c7t2q,Joshjingles,2,Sun Jul 5 21:45:51 2015 UTC,I was in the same situation as you earlier this year. Splurged on Octane Render and a gtx 980 and was worth every penny!   It's not for every job but anything you'd use GI in c4d For could probably be done with Octane at 10-30% of the Render time.

Cinema4D,3c7t2q,Joshjingles,2,Sun Jul 5 23:09:44 2015 UTC,Compared to vray I found it less confusing. Vrays Render settings are more complicated imo. The materials for Octane in some ways are simpler (still with lots of cintrol) but unclear at times bc of poor documentation. You'll get it with some tutorials but its weird. Documentation is improving thogh as their full v3 release is coming out this summer or fall.   Wait for that release and buy it after (unless they're offering an upgrade for cheap). Very much worth the purchase as I've found it immediately made some jobs look waaaay better.   I've always struggled with getting realistic renders (animation) in decent Render times. I find both cinema and vrays slow bucket renders dint allow me to clearly  understand the effects of tweaking  small settings. Seeing GI renders with reflections at decent frame sizes Render clean in seconds instantly made me realize the purchase was worth every penny.   Msg me if you have more questions.  V3 will work for amd's vid cards too. Gtx 980ti is the card im getting next tho.

Eg using stacked layers of various noise types, slightly animated. Use multiple blended scales of noise to get nice variation. If you're going for something with different bands of clouds, you could create several layers masked with gradients in the alpha channel. Check out the epic short film ""Wanderers"" for reference: https://vimeo.com/108650530 ... and remember that raw renders rarely look realistic on their own, finishing with post effects is important."

The 'Automatic' setting simplifies the invisible collision mesh surrounding a model by not calculating concave surfaces on the model. Which is why the books ejected, Cinema thought it was intersecting inside each other."
Cinema4D,3bwb2r,Norsak,4,Thu Jul 2 18:02:23 2015 UTC,"VR is more suited for real-time game engines like Unity and UE4, so you can interact with the environment. Renders from C4D would be like watching a movie in VR, non-interactive. You'd also have to render out your scene in 360 like an HDRI map which would be way higher res.

Cinema4D,3bvvgy,opst02,2,Fri Jul 3 09:30:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing I can point you towards that I know of but there has to be plenty of documentation about working with passes out there. There's a few good tuts on post processing archviz in Photoshop that are enlightening.  For this, what I did was start with a base render, physical renderer, progressive. Because I was going to repaint most of the scene, the lighting and textures didn't have to be perfect, just something to work with and pull passes and object buffers from.  From there I would pull out each individual element. For example, with the walls, I pretty much just grabbed a selection of the walls from the buffer and use a watercolor brush. For something like the tables, I would paint a base color and pull selections from the shadows and specular and paint respectively.  I did a handful of sketch and toon renders to get some line work and painted some of that in selectively.  The brick and ivy outside is almost all just photo composites with some basic photoshop filters.  All in all, it's a pretty easy process, just time consuming modeling the space, creating the texture for the ceiling and all the post work to make the image.  I'll post a breakdown here in a bit, thanks for the kind words."

Cinema4D,3bvvgy,wavestograves,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:36:00 2015 UTC,"It was a small company started by a few friends of mine. Because we were small, we did all kinds of work from small local commercials and events to the bigger screens content gigs. Most of the time we were contracted by the show designer and would work directly with them and their vision for the show. Often times we'd just get some creative direction from the show designer and they'd be the one to give us revisions and go pitch it to the client. The award show thing, we'd usually work from the office for a little bit and then about a week onsite.   One of the big challenges is that content needed to be whipped up really quick, it was always a race against time and in a lot of cases we were rendering things up to a few hour before Showtime...a lot of the time because feedback will come back at any time.  The whole content game was tough though because there's such a low barrier to entry. Every kid has a cracked copy of Cinema and wants to do work for these big names. There's guys out there that just edit abstract junk from Videoblocks together and call it a day (and sometimes you have to).  Also note that different from VJ gigs, the guys creating the content are usually a separate team from the dudes launching and busking with the video. The high-level shit isn't using resolute either, it's always some high-end media server, sometimes with a patch link to a lighting board. The barrier to entry is much higher with that stuff and the budget for programming the video often matched the budget for content creation.  I'd be happy to chat more if you're interested."

Little off topic but I don't know anyone who might appreciate it haha; have you seen the new Glitch Mob EP? They refreshed their brand a little with a new logo and iconography, and the new visuals for the videos are so good!

Cinema4D,3bt81o,marvinchagler,2,Wed Jul 1 23:18:25 2015 UTC,Rebus - purely based on the fact that my mac is so slow it makes rendering a sequence online almost magic.   The plugin has an error check and calculator. There are a few restrictions with what can be done - typefaces etc.
Cinema4D,3bt81o,Mind_the_gap_ok,2,Thu Jul 2 06:39:29 2015 UTC,"I also suggest Rebus, it's saved my bacon numerous times. Some say that it's too expensive, but I find that it's fairly priced especially with it's 3 pricing tiers. It supports most plugins out there, and is blazingly fast - usually downloading the sequences take longer than the actual render. You should do the cost calculator, then add some cushion money on it for the inevitable client requests and re-renders.    I've also heard Render King is good, but after using Rebus it's all I use."

Cinema4D,3bt81o,renderkingfarm,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:01:57 2015 UTC,"renderking is integrated into drop box so you literally SAVE PROJECT with ASSETS into your drop box and then (after upload of course) press START on the RK web interface.  the results come streaming back as they complete - it really helps offset the large time delay of downloading your completed render after it is all done 100%.  in many cases even on a huge farm once you add up the time of rendering + the time to download all the data after it has completed - it can be faster to render with fewer nodes (saves money) as the data streams back to you while it completes - so when the last frame(s) finish rendering that is all that is left to transfer to you ready to go with the data at the user end. (depends on how fast the job runs and the data size of the result images of course)   sure faster always sounds better but not if the cost blows out your budget or all your profits of the job you are working on. rebus is definitely fast with so many processors available, but just be careful as it can be very expensive - often the final cost may be a surprise too if you are not careful with your render times. RK has flat price options so you have no cost surprises and can render what you need over a number of days (if desired). i would suggest just looking at the info on the respective sites, getting an idea of your render times of your project, total frames to render, and costs that may be incurred and go from there with what your deadline and turnaround time may dictate."

Cinema4D,3bpx1m,chemam,3,Wed Jul 1 05:03:57 2015 UTC,"Looking nice. I like the typography.    You might want to check the gap on the third one, between the ""+""and ""Juan Casasnovas""It looks a bit tighter than the other ones.  I think it's a pity that the plexus or atom array element is not really integrated with the abstract 3d blob...it's just overlayed. It'd be nicer if parts of it were obscured. Are all the gradients supposed to be 1 to 1 with the 3d pieces? The middle one, the green one looks off. It's drifting more towards yellow and when it fades to black, it gets a red tint...which you don't have in the 3d element. Layout wise I like the 1st one, the red one, best. Because the bottom bit of the 3d element is peeking from underneath the chart frame, you get a nice sense of depth.   Care to explain how you made the abstract stripped element? was it just a texture? It looks like you got some highlights on the edges, though. Did you photoshop them in, or is it done with geometry?"
Cinema4D,3bpx1m,searchserge,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:09:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is some quality constructive criticism right here!   Nice catch there! There are two atom arrays, one that's mostly inside the striped shape and one that covers it. There is the subtle interaction, but not enough to stand out. I'm still figuring out how to get more control over the scene, it can get a bit overwhelming.... The coloring is achieved with gradient maps in photoshop, all renders came out from c4d like the 3rd one, that one I kept original. So yeah, there were some warm tones in the gradient map that generated that color palette, I'm not bothered by it! I'm glad you do, I think they each have something interesting going on, I can't decide on one.   The abstract striped element is a metaball made of a few spheres. The stripe effect was achieved by complete accident haha! I added transparency to the material, and then added a checkboard texture with 0 ""U frequency"" so that I get a stripe effect and not checkerboard. That's it!

That will put the material only on the front cap (C2 for back cap and use R1 and R2 if you have rounded corners)"

I looked closely at the pattern for the honeycomb arrangement of the hexagons, and it is the same pattern of how they are randomized in their y-position. So you'd create a cluster of the hexagons using linear or grid cloners and arranging them flush to each other in x and z, then put a random effector on their y-position. After that, it is layering more and more of them and scaling them drastically differently. You could do the placement of the smaller clusters either by hand (slow) or making a base template to use an Object Cloner to clone them onto the large cluster. From there, it is all in the materials, lighting and post-fx."

Cinema4D,3bcja7,uncleBING0,3,Sat Jun 27 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"Well done, very accurate. I'd say the hat itself is a little thick though, the brim looks maybe twice as thick as it should. The felt material is really nice, but it looks a little wet, kind of like rubber. I'd reduce the specularity a bit, a good way to judge is that the felt shouldn't be catching the reflected light off the floor. If you're using a noise texture for the felt, try squishing it along the x axis, as the felt used in making these hats it made of lots of thin fibres.  The material for the band is spot on but change the projection to cubic or UVW mapping; looks like you've got it on flat atm, and it makes the bit at the front of the band look stretched.  I can see a few straight lines from the polygons around the rim of the hat, maybe bump up the hypernurbs by 1 if you're using one :)  If you keep working on this, make sure to post a new render as a reply, we'd all like to see where you take it!"

The work you have is very strong, but I found myself getting board just due to the timing.  The actual content doesn't start until 9 seconds in, which is almost 1/6th of what your run time should be.  I feel this demo reel is a perfect example of pacing.   https://vimeo.com/62434236  Not only did they cut to the music well, but they also edited the music so that they could get the most upbeat parts into a short amount of time.

Your scene is very 1 dimensional, so you won't be able to get much out of DOF effects.  You may not have set the fstop low enough in the camera setting.

My school reel didn't consist of just school projects, which is what separated my reel from the others. I got work through the schools career recruiters and have been getting contracts doing 2d/3d work and video work. Really good idea to keep your skills sharp in multiple programs in case the demand is elsewhere at the time. I've been employed all 3 years as a freelancer. Mostly tech companies such as Seagate, Monster headphones, SanDisk, etc.. The money is good but the work isn't as fun as some 3d stuff you'd like to do. Mostly product rotations and simple camera animations. Lifestyle videos and after effects titles or tracked text etc. I don't remember the last time I played with effectors or things in cinema4d. It's mostly been product/lifestyle videos which I got good at. So many paths and ways. This is just how it worked out for me. But all these things are possible.

Cinema4D,3b69mu,SoniCloud,2,Fri Jun 26 08:54:13 2015 UTC,There should be a setting in the physical sky properties. You could also directly turn of the floor in the basic tab. Further compositing options should be in one of the other tabs
Cinema4D,3b69mu,saebba,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:57:45 2015 UTC,"I think I've clicked every property under sky and nothing happened. The only thing that changes it is when I unclick physical sky, but that's the thing I need to effect the ship."
Cinema4D,3b69mu,saebba,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:02:31 2015 UTC,I think you could also add an compositing tag and just hide it from camera
Cinema4D,3b69mu,tortilla_thehun,2,Fri Jun 26 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"R15 user here so things may have changed with the new version but there's an option under the ""Sky"" tab to enable the horizon line: http://imgur.com/cfL0cKe  It seems like you already tried that but I just had to make sure.  Are you sure it isn't some other object in your scene causing that horizon (e.g. a plane or floor object on which your rocket is casting shadows)?   If that's the case, you can always add a compositing tag to the plane object and render a Multi-Pass with shadow enabled and a separate object buffer for the rocket. However (in R15 at least), keep in mind that a physical sky cannot be output separately as a Multi-Pass but I don't think it would matter."
Cinema4D,3b69mu,fernandocreative,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"Oooo... yeah you're right it was something completely different. I downloaded something from turbosquid, and they grouped a floor object on one of the layers. lol, oops."

Cinema4D,3b5q4a,cheesyvee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:09:19 2015 UTC,"What's happening is that the average of the selection is at zero. Either do them one at a time, or use the ""set point value"" tool.   Select the points>set point value>attributes manager> find the axis/es that you want to set> select ""set"" and set value to 0 (zero) or whatever value you want/need.

Cinema4D,3b3rg1,sageofshadow,3,Thu Jun 25 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"I think OP means like this:  http://i.imgur.com/cmJismJ.jpg  Could do it a number of ways. Could go with displacement, or even just a bump map.   I'd probably suggest making the cone object flat, then using a deformer to wrap it into the cone shape. Though, there might be an easier way to get the texture oriented correctly."
Cinema4D,3b3rg1,rootyb,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"yes! just like that. I've been playing around with displacement on a cone (mostly cell noise), but after lots of trial and error nothing I try matches the pattern - it looks abstract, but not realistic."
Cinema4D,3b3rg1,camotito,3,Fri Jun 26 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah displacement will be your friend - like /u/rootyb mentioned, the tiler shader in a layer, with some distortion, maybe add some noise, and then use the Transform effect to get the angle right. Here's a quick screenshot of the setup at it's simplest. I did an ice cream cone a long time ago and used a similar technique, wish I'd added some noise for the granularity :)."
Cinema4D,3b3rg1,rootyb,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:10:26 2015 UTC,I made a grid in Photoshop and used that with some noise on a displacement channel. The color is done with the same grid image and a couple of colorizer shaders.
Cinema4D,3b3rg1,2visible,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"i would model a plane with those ridges elevated (just a few and then clone them to make a larger area) and then bend it in the final shape.  using displacement is, of course, a good alternative, but you have to have the model UV-ed correctly and then paint the ridges (or use layered noises over a grid pattern with careful masking). i think this is the better solution if you want photorealistic results."

Easy fix - try increasing your anti-aliasing to ""Best"" and if that doesn't do the trick try increasing your min and max levels. (The worst AA reflections I've ever dealt with were fixed by having them at 2x2 and 8x8 with a 5% threshold.)  I'm also not sure if you're going after a grainy material but in case you weren't - if you rendered this with GI enabled - you can always try increasing your sample count for less grain and smoother light distribution.  This is my first post so I hope I was at least somewhat helpful!"

Cinema4D,3avptn,Bergtop,2,Tue Jun 23 21:52:34 2015 UTC,I have the same problem.  I am working on a small project in which I am modelling assets for a game. Our developer then deals with the imports and so on but I would like to be able to test my scenes out in Unity sometimes to a feeling for what I am creating.  I would also appreciate any advice.
Cinema4D,3avptn,realfootballer007,2,Tue Jun 23 22:20:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I can't think of any wish I had known earlier, because I am still a noob in Unity. There are a few things I can tell you that might be helpful.    Unity understands the UV map from C4D.    If you set your project up correctly, when you save in c4d it will auto update in unity.    Don't forget about scale! Unity physics like to try and be accurate to real world, and a lot of times in C4D one might just use the scale as a reference. If you are making a cannon ball in C4D to use inside of unity, you might want to google the circumference and weight of a cannonball. I've noticed accurately scaling and sizing models makings all physics behave much more predictable inside Unity. Properly sizing a human will allow you to use actual gravity (-9.8?), and have the human behave how you might expect. Making him huge or tiny will have you guessing numbers all day."
Cinema4D,3avptn,upOwlNight,2,Tue Jun 23 22:33:53 2015 UTC,"Heads up, unity often CAN use the source files from C4D, Max, Maya, etc. But best practice is to keep them outside of your project and export to FBX for the files you use in your project."
Cinema4D,3avptn,njtrafficsignshopper,2,Wed Jun 24 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"I use C4D and unity, my workflow when i need to export a level is: i split every face of the agglomerate of shapes (useful if you want to apply different material on every face with drag and drop, i don' t know if more materials assignement can kill the performances, maybe too much variety of material in one project but it' s worth if you want to make detailed scenes) unity 5 is great btw, if you want to make every faces on their own you follow those lines: 1- select the object, select all the faces (ctrl+A) 2- right mouse click and select the cogwheel on the disconnect option, delete the mark on ''preserve groups'' and hit ok 3- go to Mesh--->conversion--->polygon groups to object 4- you have now your object subdivided in more objects per faces!  Another thing i do if i model assets 1-model them in cinema 4D 2- export in obj the lowpoly 3-import in UV headus layout and make the UV's (very nice program i recommend it) 4- export the unvrapped obj or overwrite it 5- then i made the highpoly model based on the lowpoly in the same c4d project with booleans and subDivision surfaces (supporting edges are a keyword you need to search for when you work with subD). 6- then i duplicate the lowpoly one more time and i make the cage object based on the lowpoly, he need to have the same topology of the lowpoly, so just simply apply one modification to the duplicated lowpoly: select all the faces, right click--> normal move--->inflate the cage until it takes inside the highpoly and the lowpoly version of the model 7- now export the object in 3 version: lowpoly, highpoly, cage, all in obj or fbx, triangulate them first. 8-bake the normal map using those 3 meshes inside xnormal (free program, search more on youtube especially how to use the cage file) 9-now you can paint the others textures using the lowpoly model with the normal map applyed inside substance painter (awesome program, my texturing program choice, PBR textures ready with all the manual control you want) 10-done, export the textures for unity 5. 11-import in unity the lowpoly model, create a material for it and apply all the textures (you may want to unify two textures first in photoshop, roughness and specular inside one, roughness need to stay in the alpha channel and then export from photoshop in TGA 16 bit compressed) 12- you have your model with full PBR textures inside unity 5 with the standard material of unity 5  IMPORTANT: if you have details that go inside each others or that are not continues (imagine a plastic wrap that contain the model during the normal map bake, if you have the wrap in need to insert in some spaces...bake separately the pieces of one object making their own version of: lowpoly, highpoly and cage.  Hope that helps."

Cinema4D,3avkav,tcollier91,6,Tue Jun 23 21:12:03 2015 UTC,a tracer? you can trace the tip and it would make a spline then sweep it or you can use the sketch and toon to get flat lines on the spline.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WXfjWmAH-E

Cinema4D,3avi6y,shrimp_flyrice,5,Tue Jun 23 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"you could boole it like /u/themanseanm says. I don't find myself using boole objects a lot because I can't stand the sloppy polygons. many times it doesn't matter what your polygons looks like, as long as you're happy with the result. A lot of times it does matter.    If it were me I'd model the crack in. Make a backup hidden duplicate version of your Lathe first.    Bake one of them, by pressing  ""C"" with the lathe selected, or clicking on the ""make editable"" tool.    This step could be done a million ways, but I might start with trying to make a spline in the front view with the exact shape of the crack. Once you are happy, select all points and subdivide until you have way more points than would normally be necessary.    Next I would line the crack up onto the bell and make sure its in the right place and the right size. (It might be best to line up the crack spline in the front view, and center it)    Once you're happy with the placement, select the spline, make sure none of the spline is touching the bell, Go to front view, right click and find ""Project"" or in the menus, Mesh>Spline>Project. apply. This should push your spline up against your bell nicely.    Now that you have a nice reference set up, I'd delete one row of polygons on the bell that fall in the ""crack"" or inside the spline.    Turn on your magnet tool. Select 3D snapping and Spline snap, turn the other features of the magnet tool off.    Now you can literally start dragging the vertices of the bell on either side of the row you deleted earlier to snap to the spline.    Depending on how often the crack changes direction and how many polies your bell has, you might need to use the knife tool to add more polygons. If you aren't worried about poly count you can just select ""loop"" in the knife tool. If you are worried about poly count you're going to have to work the n-gons out by working down towards the rim (this is a whole other topic and great skill to have)  To clean up you will have to do some bridging if your bell had any thickness to it. If it's just flat, you can add a cloth curbs with thickness, or dupe it and more bridge or stitch work.  I feel bad. I made that sound very complicated."
Cinema4D,3avi6y,upOwlNight,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response. I am going through your reply and modeling the bell. So far I have projected the spline on the bell.  However I am stuck at this part:   Now that you have a nice reference set up, I'd delete one row of polygons on the bell that fall in the ""crack"" or inside the spline.   I dont understand what you mean by rows. Could you tell me how exactly to do it. Thanks."
Cinema4D,3avi6y,upOwlNight,2,Wed Jun 24 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"ok here I got some images. Hopefully they made sense. This should explain what I was talking about with deleting and snapping, but I was paying no attention to poly count here, just a rough example.  http://imgur.com/a/TvoIe"

Cinema4D,3avi6y,themanseanm,5,Wed Jun 24 21:20:14 2015 UTC,Maybe if you could create the inverse of the crack as an object you could use the bool to cut out the shape from the bell.
Cinema4D,3avi6y,ilikefarting,4,Tue Jun 23 21:23:59 2015 UTC,"Booles are bad, and make for some pretty brutal geometry. Make the bell editable, subdivide until you have enough polygons to work with around that crack and work away at deleting and cleaning up points."
Cinema4D,3avi6y,uncleBING0,2,Tue Jun 23 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"Lathe the bell. Duplicate, make editable. Model in other broad details. Add loops in for the crack. Delete and close holes."

Cinema4D,3aue2k,thatdbeagoodbandname,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  A small question: do you suppose it would be better that I just cut the part of the ""cable"" that's simply a cylnder.. bent and curled? I mean, since it is very simply a cylnder bend arbitrarily in a few places, I can probably more easily re-create it, than to have to do many bend deformers to get it exactly the way I want"
Cinema4D,3aue2k,thatdbeagoodbandname,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:40:20 2015 UTC,That's hard to say -- honestly there's usually no substitute to trying all of the above! :)  Sometimes you never know what way would work best until you try something out.

Cinema4D,3ar1i5,SargeantSasquatch,5,Mon Jun 22 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"This project took me hours and it still far from perfect. But I have other things to do at the moment and I would like to share a bit of my modeling process. I was inspired by this picture. And I wanted to see if I could get close to it.  When modelling a 3d object I came to the conclusion that the hardest thing is to choose the right strategy. There are so many ways to approach this. I started out with a 'sphere' but eventually ditched it for a 'cone' shape. I put the cone in a 'hypernurbs' (subdivision surface).  Then came the big seams on the cap. I extruded, cut etc, several times until I was kind of satisfied with it. But it was real pain. Extruding inwards and then using the hypernurbs messes up the mesh a lot. I also put the cone in a 'cloth surface' to give it some more depth. The texture was made in a program called 'Substance designer'. It is ok but I would like to have some more depth.  Next thing was the embroidery. While researching embroidery and cinema 4d. I came across this video. He did the same thing I was doing (but several times better). I checked out his video to see if I could learn his trick. But the clip was too short to learn anything meaningful. What I eventually did was separate the splines. Then put some spheres along the spline with a 'cloner'. Then move the clones from one spline to the other with the 'spline effector' and trace their paths. Then I turned the the traced paths into splines and added hair to the splines. So you kind of get and embroidery look.  The threads are a 'Torus' cloned along a spline. It works kind of ok but the direction of the threads is sometimes a bit off.  I also did a bit of sculpting to give it some dents.  It was great learning experience!"
Cinema4D,3ar1i5,physicalzero,6,Mon Jun 22 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"Cool piece. I know nothing about 3D modeling...I sub here because I love looking at everyone's work. I do work with embroidery. If you want to increase realism with the 3D puff embroidery, take a look at images like this: http://i.imgur.com/48fMxen.jpg  If your model wasn't based on 3D/puff style embroidery, the stitch style could have passed as an embroidered piece. 3D/puff embroidery is always done with side-to-side/satin/zigzag style stitching. Basically a line going back and forth following a parallel shape path. For even more realism, you could slightly bevel the edges and end caps of the top layer to more closely simulate the stitching sewing over the foam. With 3D embroidery, foam is laid down on the cap before sewing begins. After the logo is sewn, the top edges/ends of the logo retain a rounded edge."
Cinema4D,3ar1i5,mcmlxiv,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:52:32 2015 UTC,"Good to see you learnt something from it, even if it's not right.   Constructively, there's a few tricks I have that may help you and some criticism that might also be of use.   Firstly, let's get the crap out the way; The glaring thing for me (maybe it's because I own a few of these) but the bill should have the threads that radiate out from the panels of the hat. Check your inspiration picture, I count six of 'em.   The proportions do seem off, but I think it's not a big deal, just needs to be taller overall.  Personally, I think it's a little uniform, I'm having trouble seeing the dents but maybe that's just me and the last thing is something strikes me as odd where the thread that goes round the hat seems to be lit differently to the threads coming from the button at the top.  The tip i was going to suggest was in the following tutorial. look at the dynamite and fuse part and watch carefully where he makes the fuse. Could be a handy tip for the thread. http://greyscalegorilla.com/blog/intro-to-cinema-4d#   Hope that all helps!"
Cinema4D,3ar1i5,SanityDzn,2,Tue Jun 23 12:56:15 2015 UTC,I think the edges on the 'b' could be softened up a bit.
Cinema4D,3aris4,VoidValkon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Maya guy, but you're probably perfectly fine exporting FBX, or maybe even Alembic.  Concerning your import being off, perhaps some more details about your C4D scene would be useful? Motion Camera? Morph? Animating a null rather than the camera? Is in following a path/spline? How, align to spline? Etc.   But if it's close, I'd almost bet there is something set incorrectly in either C4D's render settings/project settings, or in Maya.  Also, make sure all your fps, etc are the same."
