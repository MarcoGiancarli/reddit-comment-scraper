google,3e3ay1,canausernamebetoolon,77,Tue Jul 21 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"No.  Short answer: they can't.  Long answer: this is information provided to/by windows; all Windows knows about the process is that ""chrome.exe"" is running something.  Sysadmins have the same difficulty with ""SVCHost.exe""  .... well, which service is it? the answer: one of them.  task manager doesn't have the infrastructure to determine which extension/service/subroutine a particular process is doing; the gathering of such information would need either some kind of API, provided by MS, where the process could put additional information about THIS INSTANCE of the application, or Taskmanager would need to violate and analyse the processes memory, possibly causing access faults, crashing the application or the PC.  Simply put, the best option is an API, and that's up to MS, and they haven't done it.  Complaining to Google about this is, to coin a phrase: barking up the wrong tree.  Google provided their best option for providing this information, they coded their own task manager, which interfaces with the various processes of Chrome to determine not just that they're there, but what are they doing....   Right-click on the chrome title bar, select task manager, or shift+esc as /u/AquaWolfGuy pointed out, to get to the Chrome Task Manager.

I negotiated a higher salary than my coworkers and in turn my managers demand a higher quality product from me. I often work longer hours and have management coming to me for numbers and projects on a frequent basis. I asked for more money and I got a higher workload (which I'm not complaining about). My coworkers don't know what I make but they all complain about their market rate salaries and don't offer to contribute or volunteer for projects.  If you're creating value for a company they will pay a premium to keep you.

The new editing interface is frankly, awful.  As is the new 'auto' enhance.  It might be fit for mobile, but on desktop there is no excuse to have removed so many useful and well-done editing features.  I really don't understand why Google had to reinvent the wheel, when Google+ Photos was nearly perfect except for the fact it was tied to Google+."

google,3e140b,DigiSmackd,2,Tue Jul 21 06:16:49 2015 UTC,"Fully agree. I made a similar comment a while back when the change was first being rolled out.  It was the first thing I noticed..the logical, useful, and great basic editing features were replaced with illogical alternatives and a slew of ""Instagram-like"" filters.  I don't want to use my ever-improving camera found in current cell phones only to edit them to look like they were taken in the 50's and then poorly developed.  Fine, keep those options (because clearly many other people like them)..but why remove the ones that were there too??"
google,3e140b,JamesR624,0,Tue Jul 21 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"Because if you want all those editing features,  you download Snapseed. It makes sense so that we done have redundant editing services.   And yes,  when downloaded, it integrates seamlessly into Google Photos."
google,3e140b,jeremynsl,4,Tue Jul 21 07:05:21 2015 UTC,"I wasn't aware of that integration, thanks for the info.  However that isn't really a replacement:   It only works on mobile.  Most of us serious about our photos usually work on desktop. The edits result in a new file, not non-destructive as they previously were. It does not restore the missing auto-enhance.  Let me quote a user on Google+ w/ regards to exactly what is missing (and it's a lot!)    For me, the biggest problem is not just that the photo editing capabilities are much worse. I can always run Snapseed manually.  The biggest problem is that Google removed Auto Enhance, and replaced it with something inferior.  (I'm not taking about Auto Awesome. That's still there.)  I've tried both ""auto"" features, and Auto Enhance from Google+ wins almost every time. It automatically smooths out skin tones, removes red eyes, whitens teeth (!) and centers the vignette on the actual faces present in the pictures. It looks subtle rather than over processed. And it practically never fails, or makes photos worse. And you could have it automatically enhance every uploaded photo.  The new Google Photos just makes all photos look over processed and pseudo HDR. It's not nearly as good. Also it frequently makes photos worse than the originals. And it's not automatic, like Google+ was. No, now you have to edit each photo manually! This is no improvement. It's just stupid.  Please make Auto Enhance available in the future. It's easily the best photo feature Google ever invented.﻿"
google,3e140b,cunningmunki,3,Tue Jul 21 07:36:40 2015 UTC,This is fucking awful news. The new photos app needs to catch up quickly in terms of editing features before they shut the old one down.  Looks like I might be on the hunt for a new photo storage/editing solution. Anyone know any?

The one benefit is that if Google has a version of an album you own on its servers then it'll recognise the id3 tags and not upload the album, but if it doesn't then it will upload your tracks.

By 2010, when Google introduced video ads, most analysts felt they broken even or made a slight profit (Google does not release figures). As recently as February analysts are still saying Google is breaking even. They keep bumping up video quality and thus raising costs, but it looks like this is offset every year by the increase in money made.   I've always guessed they are quite purposefully bumping video quality/bandwidth usage in sync with their added revenue, as an attempt to push ISPs to modernize their offerings. But I am sure it also helps in their battle against Vimeo and Twitch."

google,3dtilt,Joshbot,4,Sun Jul 19 12:50:54 2015 UTC,"It sounds like (and I would think this is pretty obvious) your account got hijacked. You saw a sign-in from a device you don't recognize in a country you don't live in. Someone got your password and used it to take over your account. At that point, I imagine you sending an account recovery e-mail/starting that process (or something else similar) caused them to notice that something was awry and it's locked until they can follow-up/fix it.  Until Google finishes whatever follow-up they need to do on their end, they won't typically be in touch, is my understanding. I think just the volume of account recoveries they have to do precludes providing individual communication to each person involved in one.  I sound like a broken record in threads like these at this point, but this is why you use 2-factor authentication."
google,3dtilt,superdiscodancefloor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"I filled out the form for recovery twice (~10 days gap gap in between) for I haven't heard anything back from Google after first submission. Then, I tried their help forums to be able to find a solution. One of the top contributors in the forum contacted Google and this was his feedback: ""I have not been told why your account will not be re-enabled, for reasons of your privacy. But I have been clearly told that your account is not eligible to be re-enabled. Sorry. "" which sounds like that had gone through some sort of investigation process (i doubt) and concluded not to re-enable my account. I believe nearly one month had passed since I filled out the recovery form for the very first time."
google,3dtilt,Joshbot,7,Mon Jul 20 10:25:12 2015 UTC,"Abuse of their own policy? IANAL, but I'm fairly certain they have every right to disable your account for any reason. Just like Reddit has the right to censor whatever content they choose to do."
google,3dtilt,scottrobertson,2,Sun Jul 19 09:48:52 2015 UTC,"Given that people store large parts of their livelihood in Drive, it's where all their contacts are, and so on, I don't. They are nothing like Reddit. It's more like if your electricity company shut off your lights for watching films they don't approve of. And from a business point of view, they are playing with fire-- users will trust them less, and as they grow into a monopoly they are just begging for state regulation if they act callously. Consumers do have rights."
google,3dtilt,ciny,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"Google is not like another private corporation, but instead it's like a utility company? Holy shit dude, you need to realise that Google is a business, and businesses chase money. They don't own you anything. If you have large parts of your life on Google, that is by your own choice.   You have a right to clean water, equal treatment in the eyes of the law and electricity to keep you warm. But you do not have a right for Google to play nice with you."
google,3dtilt,Shadow14l,2,Mon Jul 20 01:26:29 2015 UTC,"What? There are absolutely consumer rights outside of utilities. Tons of them. I don't even know where to start. Private companies aren't allowed to do whatever they want, and that's a really positive thing for society. Look at the right to be forgotten in Europe, for one example that relates specifically to Google. If the state stepped in to stop Google from playing with users' lives, especially a company that is so huge, it would not be at all unheard of."

They could easily tack on charges to their offerings, but choose to keep them free.  Now sure ""free"" is relative when the Google naysayers come and say all these things about Google owning you.  But other companies own you and charge you big bucks for it(Hi Apple, I'm looking at you... Or your Buddy Microsoft).  They also provide valuable open source code, and powerful libraries that developers can freely use to develop amazing things.  Not to mention their patent pledge to never sue offensively.  Which allows the little guys to use their tech while not being punished for it.  The only other company that does this with a better track record would probably be RedHat"

google,3doqjf,timawesomeness,40,Sat Jul 18 07:57:56 2015 UTC,"JESUS Google. It's like you WANT Android on Tablets to keep failing.  Every time they change a tablet interface, all they do is make it worse. Hangouts, YouTube, Gmail, SystemUI All had AMAZING Tablet interfaces in 3.0 Honeycomb and 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. They around 4.1, they just said, ""Fuck it. Let's just GIVE the tablet market to the iPad. We don't give a fuck anymore.""  I hope for their sake that this is all about making multi-window work better (yes, for multi-window, Phone apps on a tablet are better).

google,3doqjf,JamesR624,18,Sat Jul 18 10:57:57 2015 UTC,Fuck it. Let's just GIVE the tablet market to the iPad   Or Windows. I've noticed a lot of tablet manufacturers go from Android to Windows 8 over the past year.

Anybody who has tried to use a tablet for actual work, iPad or Android, knows the os limitations, being based off a phone os, make it impossible. As soon as computers shrink enough with good enough battery life (we are there already honestly with the surface pro) and someone comes up with an os that works as a desktop mouse/keyboard and touch (windows 10, cross your fingers) there will be zero reason to ever use the current generation of tablets, or at least tablet OS's."

We absolutely read all your feedback and the teams seriously take it into account when they make changes.  Try to be specific so we know where the issues are. Feedback like ""I don't like it"" is useful but it's even more useful if you provide feedback that points to a specific feature or task you're having trouble with.  Thanks everyone!"

Not only does it make using the thing more of a hassle, but it really makes you question the future of the platform when even Google themselves start removing the tablet UI on their biggest applications, leaving people with the dreaded blown up phone interface you see above.  I'll definitely leave feedback wherever I can, and hopefully we'll see some renewed focus on tablets in the future!"

google,3doqjf,STEEL_PATRIOT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"There's two main issues with it.   First, it takes a lot more clicks to get anywhere. Before on tablets you had account actions, subscriptions, playlists, all on the same screen at once. Now, everything is under it's own little menu, under a different tab than the one you enter into the app from.   Second, with everything split up, the readability and presentation of everything has gone down hill. With the exception of 'What To Watch' everything is in a single column, stretching from one end of the screen to another. It's really no different from the new phone layout whatsoever, and looks and feels like a badly blown up phone ui, like Facebook's app does. It looks bad, wastes an amazing amount of space, and makes reading anything a strain as it crawls on in a single line from one edge of the screen to the other. In it's current state, this version of the app has no business calling itself 'Designed for Tablets'."

I have my entire career thanks to the people I met on G+, who through Hangouts taught me most of what I now know about linux and gave me the thirst to learn more, leading to my current job as a linux admin.

Someone posted a video he recorded from his telescope that actually showed the individual solar panels of an orbiting satellite, and I was like ""I want that... NOW"". So I did like a month solid of research and found out that an Orion Dobsonian XT8 was the perfect fit. It was powerful enough that I'd be able to see panels of a satellite, and some really nice details of the moon, plus some cool ass planets and clusters! You can actually see a LOT with a decent 8"" aperture like the XT8, and it was highly recommended by many people in the stargazing subreddits.  So let  me give you my month of searching advice so that you don't have to. Orion Dobsonian XT8. If you have a bigger budget get an  Equatorial Mount instead of a dobsonain style mount. Because when looking at far distances you'll notice the starts (Actually you) keep moving and you have to constantly adjust. An Equatorial Mount does all that for you and takes the earths spin into consideration to stabilize your view. You're looking at about another $200.  If you have an even bigger budget, then get one with an Equatorial Mount AND photo and video set ups Like so. These are great for taking pics of galaxies, clusters, and planets. So if you're looking to get into astrophotography this is a good choice."

google,3digvy,danweber,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"You used to be able to do something like that with the Google Location History Dashboard, but they removed it a while back. Now it just tells you the distance from a starting point, which I've never found particularly useful.  But if someone put a gun to my head and told me I had to do this, here's how I would go about it:  First, go to your Google Location History page. Select the days of interest and export to KML. This could get tricky depending on how far apart your timestamps are. It maxes out at 30 days, so if you're wanting more than that you'll have to export multiple KML files. In the KML you'll find times with lat/long coordinates attached to them that look like this:  <when>2015-07-15T22:01:32.589-07:00</when> <gx:coord>-89.658733 39.8065743 0</gx:coord>   You'd have to trim it down to only the coordinates between the times you're looking for, then calculate the distance between each lat/long coordinate. But remember Earth is a sphere, so you'd have to use the haversine formula to account for the curvature.   A little searching turns up this page with a usable spreadsheet formula. I've setup a Google Sheet where you can paste in lat/long coords and get distances between each as well as totals in both miles and km here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/102wteI4HEQG7UNDRl66VYZSovhoziHMq6ehj2bi1BJo/edit?usp=sharing  If you're signed into your Google account you should be able to make an editable copy from the File menu. If not, you should still be able to save it in Excel format.  Hope this helps!"
google,3digvy,salisburymistake,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  At a previous job I built a UI for something that looks a lot like the location history.

Investors are now calling on Google to be a little more careful about where they invest capital. Some concepts and ideas like Buzzfeed were doomed to fail from day 1. Glass and Google+ were just either too much of a niche product or mistimed. At the end of the day, Google has profitability and shareholder value as goals it must attain. It doesn't have a hope of operating on bare margins when competitors who're more than happy to cut unnecessary costs will leapfrog it where it's currently strong.    Please.

So that says, according to this article, investors are wanting less innovative products and more focus on products that are making money for Google.     Existing products are more or less fixed costs. Existing projects have employee wages and other sources of upkeep.  Investors aren't saying don't invest in anymore new products. Existing products such as Google search and Android will always have their R&D budgets. But especially in Google's case, additional product lineups are what fuel search growth.

If it's an open site like Wikipedia or IMDB, you may be able to change the photo yourself.

New York has like 3000 employees and jobs go from Product Manager to Engineers, from Sales to Marketing, from temporary contracts to chefs. In general, be truthful, excited, do your research and have a good story to tell, that's what sticks with people."
google,3d98uj,kleinfieh,2,Tue Jul 14 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  Your hiring rep should have sent you a bunch of documents that tell you what to expect and how to prepare.  If you have more questions you should email them!  Before you show up, prepare a list of questions you want to ask your interviewers.  At each of your 4-5 technical interviews you'll have a few minutes at the start and maybe a few minutes at the end if you finish early.  Don't waste that time!  Interviewers come from different teams at Google, and some will be from teams they think you'd be a good fit for.  Pump them for info on what they're working on and how your skills might contribute to their team.  You'll also be taken to lunch by someone.  That person is very likely to be from the team you'd be working with, so ask as many questions as you can as this is your best chance to find out what your future job would be like.  The lunch ""interview"" isn't part of the hiring process so don't worry about saying the wrong thing.  The questions are typical programming interview questions.  Make good use of your time.  If you think you're stuck then ask a question.  Don't be afraid to ask for a hint if you need it.  Solving the problem is important, but it's equally important to describe your thought process.  What assumptions are you making?  If there are multiple solutions, what are they and why did you pick the one you did?  How do you know it's correct?  After the interview, within a day or so, your hiring rep should get in touch to tell you how it went.  If it went well, they'll proceed with contacting professional references and sending your app to the hiring board and executive board.  There aren't any more hiring interviews after the on-site, but once you have an offer you may do some placement interviews to find the right team for you.  Good luck!"

Everything they do ultimately can be traced back to keeping you connected to a way to view web based advertisements.   Remote internet ballons.... Ads for the 3rd world.   Android auto.... Additional tracking/data collextion tools to better serve you ads.   Driverless cars.... The ability to keep you staring at the internet when normally you'd be driving.  Android TV/Chromecast...... Data collection tools to better serve you ads.  Google glass... Ads on your fucking face.   This is not rocket science here.     EDIT: OK, im not on mobile finally so I can flesh my thoughts out better now....  People keep talking about other services not having to do with ads and I agree and disagree with what they are saying all at once here, but that's only because of how it's worded.  On the surface a lot of their moves don't really help ads, but they universally feed some back end of the beast that is Google's advertsing.   Google is not altruistic. They are a business and their business is ultimately ads, full stop. Some ~95% of their revenue comes from ads, i think that alone tells you what you need to know. They don't sell search, they dont sell android.... they sell ads and they sell A LOT of them.  They do offer additional services/prodcuts but all of those efforts do something to improve efficiency or effectiveness in the advertising realm. Some of their plays do not directly affect their ad delivery and efficiency but I think honestly all of their commercial moves play back to advertising in some way  Just because these moves don't appear to influence ads today, they do, seriously, even if it takes 2-3 connections before it's apparent. I'd say each move serves one of 4 main purposes and I challenge anyone to bring up one of their services/products that does not achieve these:   Improve their efficiency in actually delivering ads Gain new users to collect data from Gain new users to serve ads to Enable people to access Google services faster, easier and uninterrupted which really ties into the first one."
google,3d46kj,Bring_dem,50,Mon Jul 13 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"Yup, and it's great. Before Google we all used to be bombarded with ads that weren't at all related to our interests.

google,3d46kj,ohnomomo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"Hi. Google ads product manager here. This is just not true. One of the keys to any successful business - like most investments - it's diversification.   If we get all of our money from ads, that makes us a pretty bad investment if the ads market tanks, doesn't it? That's happened before in tech - those of us who've been around since the last millennium remember it quite clearly.   In contrast, if we do awesome things that make the world a better place and happen to make money outside of ads, that's pretty great too, right? Everyone wins.   And by the way, the Play Store isn't exactly a miniscule business, even at Google scale. We're talking about the most popular mobile platform in the world, selling billions of paid apps.   In truth, Google getting into other markets is something everyone should like - except maybe existing companies in those spaces. It makes Google more fault tolerant and brings Googley goodness to markets that sorely need it... Like automobiles, or office software, or energy access, or Internet access, or biomedical technology. Otherwise you're just stuck with GM, Microsoft Office, PG&E, Comcast, and whatever scraps the drug companies let through.   For my money, that's pretty great."
google,3d46kj,the_mighty_skeetadon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:33:35 2015 UTC,"First off I'm totally for what Google does. They are masterful at it, its impressive. This is not a doom and gloom issue I'm concerned about, just the reality of their underlying business model (in my opinion)  Secondly, and more importantly, you've done nothing to combat what I've said and basically just spouted a koolaid induced PR fluff response.   Using the play store as some antithesis to what I'm trying to say is just a completely jaded attempt if its actually honest. Spending/purchasing habits is one of the most powerful tracking  tools available to cater advertisements to end users. Also thebplay store represents just a sliver of revenue.  I see something like the play store as a retention method to enable Google to continue tracking users as well. If they can't retain users they can't get data and if they can't get data their advertising models weaken.   Google has to play keeping up with the jonses (literally their neighbors, cupertino/mountain view) to keep driving their core business, so while yes they do offer services beyond ads it all feeds back to keeping their advertising revenue healthy. In this case they needed a corrolary to iTunes/app store because it became clear that issuing those types of services was key to keeping people in the Google ecosystem."
google,3d46kj,Bring_dem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:30:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I'm not part of any PR fluff machine. I'm telling you the obvious truth -- that an undiversified business is one that's just waiting for death.  Making Google's entire business about ads would be borderline idiocy -- and we don't do it. For some perspective, the entire Ads and Commerce organization in Google comprises less than 10% of the entire Google workforce. That means well over 90% of people in the company don't work in ads at all. And even within Ads and Commerce, a significant portion is dedicated to Payments, Wallet, Shopping, Analytics, and basic Infrastructure.  Furthermore, I'm sorry but you just don't understand Google. Googlers don't join this company because it's the best advertising company in the world. They join because it's the best place to build cool stuff that could fundamentally change the way we live. The grand majority of Googlers hate ads -- and actively maintain separation between their products and ads.  You're accusing us of using a huge number of signals to figure out advertising for you, but it's just not true. Here's how segregated it is -- even WITHIN ADS, we can't share information. Youtube ads can't use what you've searched for to personalize your ads. All those gmail messages we scan? We don't use those to personalize your search ads, or display ads, or youtube ads. They just affect your gmail ads.  Why? Because Google is chock full of people who care about USERS first. I have no doubt that we could double our revenue in no time if we wanted to do some of the shady stuff Facebook is doing. But that's just not the kind of company Google is. And hopefully it stays that way."
google,3d46kj,the_mighty_skeetadon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"I wasn't claiming you were PR directly, more than youve kinda drank the koolaid and are justifying their business practices because of a pride issue being a googler yourself.  I'm not claiming that google is not diversified, they clearly are. I am just saying how they diversify and what they diversify in positively affects the underlying ad business. The things they diversify into are amazing, and the people who work on them I know are top notch in their respective fields, but just becasue the day to day mission of those diversified services/products isnt ads I still think its supporting the cause even if only in an ancillary way. Ads are an overwhelming majority of their revenue, it is their business, so everything they do should support it in some way even if its loosely connected in a strategic way. This isn't a bad thing, I think it's a great business model actually and it lends itself to the public being more or less in the dark in regards to just how much of a behemoth google is in the advertising space.  What I do find interesting though is that the data isnt ultimately shared across platforms for the same google user. I would think that what you view on youtube should tie to what you purchase on google wallet or the play store which ties to what you stream on chromecast which ties to what you search for.... etc.  While it may not be shared openly it does have to connect in some way to the user profile, right? Why wouldnt they use that to build better algorithms to collect data and serve ads?  I'm not attacking google here, I want to make that claer, im praising them. What they are capable of is astounding. I would love to work for them one day as I deal with mission critical electrical distribution design as well as distributed generation so if I could get into their data center design/management teams i would be head over heels."

That's what you're not understanding -- we try to avoid things that are privacy-sensitive, EVEN IF it means we won't make as much money on ads. I know that we make most of our money off of ads today, but what I'm trying to tell you is that Google (and its success) is not grounded in the principle of making the most money we can.  To understand how Google has thought about this and continues to think about it, I'd read the 2004 Founders Letter, which went our right before IPO: https://investor.google.com/corporate/2004/ipo-founders-letter.html  Here's a key quote that will help you understand, though I doubt you really will believe it:   Many companies are under pressure to keep their earnings in line with analysts' forecasts. Therefore, they often accept smaller, predictable earnings rather than larger and less predictable returns. Sergey and I feel this is harmful, and we intend to steer in the opposite direction.  Google has had adequate cash to fund our business and has generated additional cash through operations. This gives us the flexibility to weather costs, benefit from opportunities and optimize our long term earnings.   We think that creating markets like self-driving cars can be one of those long-term opportunities. In reality, I think our vision lengths have gotten even longer -- 10+ years."

Giving consumers an avenue to begin Google's transition into a ISP and carrier company. Most likely will be used within Project ARA and other projects or services.   Google Fiber - Offering users an opportunity to receive incredibly faster Internet speeds than cable. Giving consumers the chance to Google search and browse the internet much faster than previously before.

google,3d46kj,Bring_dem,5,Mon Jul 13 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"I agree they are an advertising company but disagree with your period usage. They started out as a search engine, a very sophisticated search engine, but now are a completely different beast.   They created Google Ads to allow companies to advertise on their search engine and on various websites, which today generates most of their revenue. Once Apple created a smartphone, and Google saw people searching on Safari web browser, they felt that their original search engine could be diminished greatly due to not innovating enough with smartphones. To ensure that their search engine (and subsequently their advertising business) stays at the top for future devices, they bought Android and created their own smartphone OS. They're using this philosophy in every project they touch to ensure that they're services stay afloat in this ever-changing 21st century market.    To ensure that their search engine (and subsequently their advertising business) stays at the top for future devices, they purchase or innovate: _______ and created their own _______.    They do not want to repeat what Yahoo did years ago: declining to purchase Google when they had the chance. Basically failing to innovate or purchase companies that transitions their preexisting services into future devices or platforms. Google is aware of this, which is why they are spending so much money and attention on moonshot projects and internet services. To create the future devices and services themselves instead of waiting for permission. This makes them much more than a advertising company, they are an innovating company breaking the status quo. Kinda like GE with a mix of Tesla."
google,3d46kj,Xtorting,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"A much more eloquent way of putting it for sure.   Providing internet services is, in my eyes, a move to force large telco's into improving internet access/quality/availability. This inhibits more users the opportunity to use google services, which again all ties back to tracking users and improving ad delivery."
google,3d46kj,Bring_dem,5,Mon Jul 13 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think an effect of Google moving into telecommunication and ISP markets is to improve America's infrastructure and pressure the current companies to innovate. But much more than just ensuring their advertising business stays afloat, in my mind, they also want to become something much bigger than a search engine who advertises with user generated information. They desire the internet to eventually be offered to all devices under one contract, breaking the status quo again. Pressuring internet companies like AT&T and Comcast to no longer split home and phone internet contracts, but combine them.   Imagine Project Fi being a test for expanding Google Fiber into phones and homes. Google Fiber cities would instantly have a Google network that would probably have some form of internet hubs or pylons, like they're doing to 10,000 NYC phonebooths. Google Fiber would then become available wirelessly in some areas, and all your devices (even the PC at home) could connect with this network. That's how they're probably going to roll out Fiber into dense cities like SF and NYC, not with Fiber wires but with Fiber towers placed on every other block. Yes, this will allow more people to Google search. But again, I think it's an effect not a cause of these innovations. These projects and services are geared towards much more than tracking users for improving ads.   Google is innovating at such speeds that they no longer are a simple advertising business, they're an entrepreneur telecommunications and ISP company who positions their products and services for future devices and platforms."
google,3d46kj,Xtorting,5,Mon Jul 13 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"This always strikes me as a very cynical response. By this argument, all broadcast networks are advertising companies. All newspapers are advertising companies. ANY company that derives its revenue from ads is ""an advertising company"".  Sure, from a certain perspective, that's correct, but I would never characterise the NY Times as an advertising company, even though the bulk of their revenue comes from advertisements. They are a newspaper with journalists who really care about what they do and want to dig up the truth as best they can and share it with the world. And sure, they pay their bills with ads.  Similarly, Google is a company full of engineers who want to provide a real and useful service to loads of users. I work at Google (in AdWords, actually), and nobody here up through the director level ever considers Advertisers our customers. Our customers are the users typing in searches, or reading their gmail, or getting driving directions to the nearest gas station. We sell ads so we can continue to work on cool things."
google,3d46kj,asciibits,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:29:40 2015 UTC,"Definitely an interesting point. There are some very clear corollaries to be made for sure but a lot of those companies still have significant revenue streams outside of simply securing advertisers buying space.  With newspapers it is the newspaper itself. With other media there is distribution, syndication, merchandising, etc.  A quick search found that the NYT digital advertising accounted for approx 10% of total quarterly revenues in the first report I could find here (Q1 2014): http://investors.nytco.com/files/doc_news/2014/Press%20Release%203.30.2014%20FINAL%20Thursday%20morning.pdf. There will be print advertisments as well of course, but I doubt that makes up a 80% gap to get it close to Google's revenue % split.  The percentage of revenue (as well as the sheer volume) that comes from advertising at google is what points me to this conclusion, I think that's far from being cynical.  I also get there are people doing cool things there every day, but the reason they are there doing it is that it drives money towards their ad business. You of all people working on that side of their business should understand that."

They aren't just an advertising company, PERIOD. Is their daily role in our lives designed more towards serving me ads? But they can't provide a ton of services for free like documents for work and enterprise software and excel, and other features and just be considered an advertising firm.   Google is an ecosystem striving towards pushing tech to the future while making it cheap or free while being easy to use. The only downside is that if you invest into the Google ecosystem you may sometimes see ads to use free software.

google,3d46kj,Xtorting,0,Mon Jul 13 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think there are 2 things.   To stay relevant in the future. How to monetize any service through adverts.   We all know what happen to Yahoo and M$ when they stopped innovating and tried to maintain status quo. Internet explorer, Yahoo messenger, Nokia, BB are all examples. Google almost lost it when Apple came out with the iPhone, but aggressively invested time, resources and money into Android and now commands a huge market share. Unless Google keeps investing into R&D and keeps innovating it will become irrelevant in the future and its whole business model will die off.  As a part of this Google, in the last few years has been involved in market disruption also. Gigabit fibre is in no way going to increase Google's revenues big time ... but what it does is force the traditional players to catch up to the standards set by Google. The key word here is ""Standards set by Google"". We can already see it happening with Hadoop, HTML5, Youtube, Gmail, ... Even if Google is not setting standards in a specific industry/product, with products like shopping, Music, Play, Hangouts, Wallet ... Google is continuously snapping at the legs of the leaders.  Now we come to the part where about monetizing all these products that they have created. Here Google is not really bothered about making money from the users of the service/product, rather they are more interested about converting it into an advertisement opportunity, while giving the user the best experience. This is what is making the traditional players who create products/services and sell them to the users (like M$) so uncomfortable about Google's disruptive practices.  So back to Sq 1 - Google is an Advertisement agency that sells display space.  The only other company that is similar to Google is FB. They are also involved in disruptive practices, they give away their products/services free of cost to users and monetize it through advertisement. Initially they tried to be too aggressive and pushed adverts into users face (due to market expectations/investor pressure ...) which ended up with FB being tagged evil - though lately it has toned down a lot."

If it is done backing up delete the Google Photos app and reinstall it, iOS does not provide a way to clear data in an app as far as I am aware. Once it is reinstalled you will have the space back.

I'm not a parent but simply silencing a phone doesn't tend to stop individuals from using them. I'd say this article is trying to attack someone for a statement that is correct and use a quick emotional jerk to get a reaction. Saying we should force a company to not do what they are made to do isnt the answer. Parenting choices can be made in a split second.

It's up to the user to use these tools to make their device confirm to their own sense of etiquette.  Letting Google or anyone else have MY device automatically confirm to THEIR rules of etiquette is a horrible idea.

Just like it's not Google's job to sort your email for you and it could be argued that it's the user's responsibility not to sign up for spam mail. What I got out of the article is that Ricker's argument is that Google has the tools and potential to create a great solution to what is arguably a problem in current society. He's not saying that it should replace parental responsibility, but would you want Google to avoid taking a venture just because it has always been assumed that it's one person's responsibility? (i.e. driving. You could say 'Stop being a garbage driver and actually follow the rules of the road. If you can't always follow the rules, stop driving. This really shouldn't be a hard concept.

Even the best driver in the world is prone to make mistakes at times for various reasons. One mistake in a car can be fatal for multiple people, including people who aren't at fault. Google venturing into that area is something that will make the streets a safer place due to reduced human error.  Coming up with a solution to people not looking at their phones as often does nothing of the sort. Looking at your phone at bad times is a personal choice that you are making to be rude. There are already plenty of tools that are available to people to prevent them from being rude at the dinner table. Put the phone on silent or turn the damn thing off. I someone is STILL checking their phone, there's really not much more you can do other than completely locking them out of the phone for a specified period of time. And this wouldn't be any more effective than just taking the phone away in the first place.  The tools are already there.

Theoretically, they could make an app that would flash conversation topics during a dinner period if the phone was woken up, which would be a polite way of telling the person not to look at their phone AND give them a way to join the conversation if they were using their phone because they felt uncomfortable (admittedly that would work better at a dinner with coworkers, but the use case still exists). Hell, they could offer some sort of benefit for getting friends to download the app and put their phones in dinner mode. Plus, they'd get hella good press if they created such an app."

I believe VR, in its current state at least, is simpler and more understood because it's full immersion and they don't have to worry about how the user interacts with the real world.

Unfortunately, I am pretty sure Google does not know what is happening on their end, or they would have solved this ongoing issue. Data corruption is kind of a bad thing for a cloud service.  This is not an issue with other cloud services. Both DropBox and OneDrive, for instance can serve the same videos, and do not corrupt the same files, especially not the local versions.  I am assuming there is some automated process breaking the files because Google wants to serve video files through the YouTube player. Which would be fine, except that I don't actually want them serving the files for playback, I just want them backed up to the cloud.  I am less sure why they feel the need to rewrite the info in local copies of my files, on my computer to match, the files they break in the cloud.

Only thing I'm worried about is sprint and their network, I had sprint before Verizon and it was horrible (granted this was about 6+ years ago)   You know if Sprint's coverage in your area is bad and T-Mobile's is good, Fi will automatically switch to and use T-Mobile, right?  Incidentally, I switched from Sprint (years ago), to T-Mobile, to Fi, and in the intervening time, Sprint made a ton of huge upgrades to their network near where I live. I think they've been working on it."

But studying the coverage map i should be alright. The places with slower connections or no connections are relatively the same as with verizon.

google,3co8t4,nahamed,28,Thu Jul 9 13:16:01 2015 UTC,"Google is jumping into the ridesharing market with a new carpooling service, RideWith, launched this week by Israeli mapping company Waze.   The funny thing is that Google's VC arm, Google Ventures, has its biggest holding in Uber.  Engaging in both makes a lot of sense. The industry they're competing in (transportation network) is huge and by and large antiquated. In search of finding an answer, it's worth investing in multiple models. Weaving across figurative land mines ala law, ever-changing consumer preferences (contemporary tastes), etc. This is a hedge to stay competitive in the industry if one experiences a road bump. For further insurance, I honestly would not be surprised if Google employ even more approaches in the coming years, since it's so important and is so within their their core competence.  But for now, both Uber and Rideshare have models that work, and I think both (or companies with similar models, e.g. Uber as to Lyft) will thrive. The success will be region or culture-specific.  May have unintentionally sounded pretentious writing this. Anyhow, just my 2cts."

For example, here's a bunch of cat pictures I selected and shared. https://goo.gl/photos/DK6J4M1W12ggydsd7 To select all photos/videos via the web interface, hold down shift and hover over the top left corner of the first picture or video, a little circle will appear if you're in the right place and when you click it a checkmark will appear. While still holding shift, go to the last picture/video you want, and do the same things as above, and every picture/video from the first to the last one will be selected. Click the share icon in the top right and you can generate a link that has a page with all of the items you selected.  On the mobile app hold down with your finger to select multiple photos and pictures. Remember that you can change your view to show more items at once.  If you want to have a single link that changes pictures/videos you need to use an album. To create an album or add items to an album, select the items you want, click the + sign in the top right, and you'll have a few different options. Find the create album or add to album, whichever you want, and hit it. One item can be in as many albums as you want. When you add or remove an item from an album, this updates for everybody instantly without you needing to send out a new link.  There is currently no way to have multiple accounts contribute to a single collection. Google Photos will show up in Google Drive as a normal folder and you can share photos there like regular documents. It might be possible to share your Google Photos folders to each other via Google Drive, give each other edit access, and copy pictures and video over.

It was a mom-and-pop store, so no real protocol to follow. If I had the time I'd put it in the cash register up front and print out a receipt to hand in at the end of the night.  University town, only driver, awesome pizza. On a friday/saturday I'd work 4PM-4AM and be flat out the whole time (used to make a fortune in tips, which was awesome) but I might go 6 hours without being able to do a cash drop (had to wait until a break in deliveries AND until there were no customers in line at the cash so I could use the only register). There were times where I'd have $3,000 locked in the glove box in my car, it always made me paranoid, thinking I was going to get murdered if anyone knew how the system worked...  tl;dr: Pizza delivery guys (and probably any busy delivery guys) are always afraid someone is going to kill them and rob them."

The signs location is probably being sent to Google's servers as a generic Pizza Hut location which is why it's showing up on your phone. Or possibly you set a location on your phone similar to work that is labeled Pizza Hut and it tagged the location as the GPS unit instead of the building. Or, you set your phone to know you're at work during a certain time so it labels you as work pizza hut during these times.   I wouldn't discount any of these possibilities. I went full dive with Google a couple of months ago and the information offered and suggested, and the relevance of it is kind of scary.   Edit: didn't answer a question.  The GPS unit would have its own power supply, you can't rely on a thief to have a 12v power supply and use it after all. A simple GPS with a location transmitter could last days with current cell phone batteries, and the battery could charge when the driver plugs it in."

google,3cl3u2,penischarmer,9,Thu Jul 9 01:13:28 2015 UTC,Okay so in order to use the chromecast you need to use wifi. Now for most people this is fine and dandy.  Now there are some cases where wifi connectivity is not so great but you have access to a port to plug into for network.   So just today. We were setting up chromecasts in the office. In one area the wifi was bogged down by all the users there. Sure we could set up another access point but that costs quite a bit of scratch(this is to service like 100 or so devices). Now this would be awesome in this situation because we got plenty of network ports.
