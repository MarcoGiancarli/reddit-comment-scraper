Here's all the brackets. Maki is in bracket B.  Nico, in bracket A, lost to Yuki Nagato. Umi is in bracket C and is facing Anri Sonohara. We don't know those results yet but we will later today, and it doesn't look good for Umi considering the seed placements. Aaaand finally, there's Honoka in bracket D, who, unfortunately, is up against Yui...I'm not even sure who I'm gonna vote for in that last one, but considering Yui is 45th seed and Honoka is 475th...my vote almost certainly wont matter anyway.  sigh, it looks like nobody from LL is going to make it past round one."
onetrueidol,3d5ibu,candycaneforestelf,7,Mon Jul 13 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"Ugh Annie? I'm actually not surprised considering how much /r/anime loves SnK. At least it's better than losing to that white haired chick in Senpai this is our fight the last time. That one really frustrated me when I voted. Nico losing to Yuki was kinda inevitable. I don't see Umi winning against Anri, and it would take a miracle for Honoka to win against Yui. Really sad the Love Live girls don't get enough love.   Also, relevant username."

Losing to Yui and Yuki would be respectable (both have rabid fan followings, though Yuki's primary character trait detracts from her character on the whole due to it being used as a crutch for not putting more effort into her), losing to Anri's kinda meh because I feel she's okay but not written to her full potential as a character, but losing to Annie is absolutely appalling. She's not written well at all aside from not talking about romance and not really being all that feminine, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a rabid fan following."

Oh yes the Nendo comes out in August, but these probably won't be for a while, it depends which ones get announced next for production. The next one in line probably for pre-order will be Alter's Nico being that it was announced prior to the rest of that list. So I think next year is a good bet!"

I have said it before but when I started I really thought I would do it for a few weeks or around a month until the semester started but then I stupidly decided to aim for a full year.  It all started with this post that I made when the subreddit was created and then the next day decided to start the daily. Now one year later /r/OneTrueIdol has ~1400 subscribers.   I will be very honest this ate up too much of my free time and during very busy times like finals I would post the daily around 11pm. Sometimes I didn't even feel like getting online to post the new daily. It also doesn't help that I set high standards for what I can post (with a few exceptions) so it would take me way longer than it should take to post something trying to find the perfect one.  So just to make it clear the daily has indeed ended and I no longer promise a new post every single day but I will still be posting every once in a while. There is still plenty of amazing fanart that I want to get around to posting eventually. This has become part of my daily routine for the past year and I currently have some free time to kill so who knows I might post something tomorrow or take a break until the weekend.   Thanks a lot /u/Aruseus493 for the title of not only this daily but many others before it. Also thanks to the mods, those that post content, comment, joined the contests/discussions, and all the lurkers/subscribers.    Ah before I forget here is the Daily Maki Album which I have not updated in a while but I will get around to it soon."

My last 6 months irl have felt really, really long, but it feels like the last 182 dailies just flew by.  There have been times where I'll be thinking of a specific fan-art that was posted, and when I go to look for it I'm thinking ""It was posted about a week ago"" when it was actually posted a month ago.  Anyway, thanks for doing this. I know that there is no way I would have been able to post 365 consecutive days of awesome fanart, and I don't know how you did it (especially during those theme weeks - what the hell were you thinking!?) so, well done!  Also, does this mean today is /r/onetrueidol's birthday?"
onetrueidol,3cdk8f,Darkgenerallord,6,Tue Jul 7 02:41:09 2015 UTC,For me the whole year just went by in a flash xD. Thanks for sticking with us for this long.  I will say it was hard to track sometimes if I had posted something already since I didn't really use a good method to save and post the dailies until around 1-2 months ago. Big thanks to /u/dxprog for adding /r/OneTrueIdol to the repost checker otherwise it would had made my life a lot harder. Although it did lie to me plenty of times by telling me something had not been posted when I was sure it had been....and caused me to repost once by accident xD (also the only repost).  Anyways the new method I am currently using to save/post dailies really made all the themed weeks a lot easier to do. It has also greatly helped me the past few weeks where I have been having major internet issues during the day.  And yes it is :)

Keep an eye on Amazon for it, though also be careful. If the price is significantly lower than elsewhere, it's probably a fake. If you can get the money within a month or two, it shouldn't be that much more expensive than it is now.  That all is if it doesn't pull a Holo or Kamina and ends up being 300+ dollars for what was at the time a 80-100 dollar figure within weeks of it going on sale.

I'll have my thoughts on the last 5 episodes in a few days once I find time to finish up watching.   It was actually fun to watch and take down notes about things you pick up on an episode. Makes you appreciate the show much more."
onetrueidol,3c55vx,patsuan,2,Sun Jul 5 02:49:07 2015 UTC,I think that is probably how I will end up by the end but even so I didn't have Umi in my top 3/4 before and I am sure she will end up in my top 2 this time.  And yes I agree from the episodes I got around to rewatching I noticed a lot of things that made me appreciate it a bit more than my first or 2nd viewing.

onetrueidol,3bcfnu,Misty_And_Maki-Chan,3,Sun Jun 28 10:51:10 2015 UTC,"With Spring anime ending this week, I managed to finish watching earlier than I expected. Tickets for the Love Live movie sold out for me. Luckily, there's a second scheduled screening in NYC. Anyways, let's move on!  Episode 5: A New Me  The second years go on a class trip to Okinawa. It was supposed to be a fun trip, but a typhoon ruins their plans. Hey, Honoka, you should totally use your powers to stop it. You did it in S2E1 didn't you? They end up playing cards and we learn Umi's poker face is terrible.  µ's is invited to perform at a fashion show once the second years return from the trip. While they're gone, Eli and Nozomi fill in for student council work, while Rin was chosen to become the temporary leader. Surprisingly, Rin doesn't like the idea and thinks she's not suited for it but everyone reassures her that she's the best pick. I was surprised Nico didn't object to it, but I guess it makes sense since a first year would be the logical choice for a successor. Final episode foreshadowing. Rin totally acts out of character, being really shy instead of the energetic girl we all know her to be. As the show date draws closer, Honoka contacts Eli telling her that their return will be delayed and only the 6 of them would be able to make it to the show. Since Honoka was supposed to be the center, they had to pick a new one. Honoka chooses Rin to be the center, to which she disagrees completely because the center had to wear a beautiful dress. Maki and Hanayo get worried about Rin. Hanayo tells Maki about how when they were kids, Rin was made fun of by the other kids when she wore a skirt one day. Because of her tomboyish attitude, Rin was never seen as a girl. To this day, Rin was still affected by it. Because of this, she insisted that Hanayo be the center instead. However, once Hanayo did wear the dress, Rin looked to be jealous of her and seemed like she wanted to do it but was scared of how everyone would react. Honoka talks to Hanayo to make sure that she really wanted to do it. In the end, they made Rin wear the dress which the audience loved, thus giving Rin the confidence she needed. The next day, Rin wears new practice clothes. She now wears a skirt without feeling embarrassed.  Episode 6: Happy Halloween  There's a Halloween event in Akiba and µ's is invited to perform along with A-RISE! With the pressure on, µ's thinks of ways to be more impactful. 3 ideas came to mind:   Club Idols: Each member dresses up to represent a club in school along with catchphrases! I was definitely caught by Maki's ribbon of temptation. Swap Idols: The girls act as a different member. Hilarity ensues. Probably the funniest scene in S2, I was dying the entire part. Non-idol behavior: µ's changes image and become punk rockers, only to be scolded by Director Minami.    In the end, none of the ideas really worked. Honoka realizes they didn't need to do anything. They're fine the way they are because each girl is unique and supports one another. µ's performs Dancing Stars on Me!  It's funny seeing Maki playing around with the rest now. The scene with them talking about the situation with dolls was nice to see. Also good to note how Kotori can stay optimistic and tries to have fun even when things never really get anywhere.   Finally, Yukiho finds an envelope containing something very troubling for Honoka. What could it be?  Episode 7: We Have to do Something  The paper Yukiho found was the result for Honoka's physical examination. Honoka cannot believe she gained weight. Only until Umi made her try on their first costume did reality sink in. With this, Honoka is put into strict diet by Umi. With µ's gaining more and more fans, they need to be in top shape for the final preliminaries. Hanayo soon follows the dieting Honoka because rice. Honoka finds a restaurant during one jogging session and drags Hanayo in. Umi finds out later by tailing them after feeling suspicious about Honoka's and Hanayo's sudden excitement in exercising. Later, the student council makes a mistake in allocating the club budgets. Kotori misplaced a request form and was accidentally approved. Eli and Nozomi offer their help, but Honoka insists they should take care of it themselves since it was their mistake. In the end, they worked all night to draft a budget for all clubs which was accepted without anyone disagreeing.  Episode 8: My (Nozomi) Wish  The final four are introduced to the public. Honoka makes a bold statement, saying ""We'll win the Love Live,"" surprising everyone, including the other members. Afterwards, the girls decide what to do for their performance. Nozomi suggests they write together a love song, which would be difficult because 1) there's not much time left, and 2) the girls have no experience in romance. In order to get inspired, the girls try to emulate a confession, hoping something would come to mind. Without any progress, the girls gather at Honoka's house to brainstorm some more where they end up watching a romantic movie. There were mixed feelings: Kotori, Hanayo, Eli, and even Nico were completely engrossed in the story, Maki was indifferent, Rin and Honoka fell asleep, and Umi was hiding on the corner feeling embarrassed by the scenes. Still not getting any inspiration, the girls call it a day. Maki has other plans. She follows Nozomi and Eli to try and find out why they insist on writing a new song when it's safer to just use an older one. The three head to Nozomi's place in order to talk about things. Nozomi ends up spilling it all, her dream of the nine of them making a song together, her story about her childhood and how she used to be alone because of constantly moving to different schools but found a home in Otonokizaka, and her involvement in forming µ's in which she pulled the strings from the background. With everything told to Maki, she finally agrees to help out and calls the rest of the girls to come over and work on the new song. Getting everyone together is µ's present to Nozomi, the goddess who created µ's. We see a different Nozomi in the end, one who gets flustered after the girls see a picture of them together and confessing how they're her friends. As snow falls, the girls notice and hurry outside to greet it. Words begin to come out of each girl: desire, melody, premonition, mystery, future, thrill, sky, feelings, love. Are they close to putting together their new song?  Now excuse me while I cry for failing to get mermaid Maki."

onetrueidol,3ajtxz,Misty_And_Maki-Chan,2,Sun Jun 21 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"Luckily, it was easy to find the OVA.  OVA: (screenshots)  OVA starts off with Maki running away from something, only to get caged and surrounded by mysterious figures. Turns out it was just a dream she had and was telling Hanayo about it. But what if they're all in a dream right now? Well it turns out they just might be in one. Maki meets a little kid who looks like her as she starts playing the piano (which for some strange reason would not work). Later on during practice, Maki was nowhere to be found. With everyone thinking she might have went home early due to illness, they decide to visit her afterwards. On their way to visit Maki, Eli runs back to the school to grab a book she left at her desk. On her way out, she sees a figure and chases after it, eventually ending up outside. But it's already dark. The girls get worried when suddenly a kid shows up who looks exactly like Maki. She tells them that they're in a dream about a never-ending party and suddenly fireworks. She also tells the girls she's known them even before they all got together and also one more thing that gets cut off as lights surround her, finally transforming back to the Maki we all know and love. The episode ends with little Maki getting to finish what she was going to say, ""I've always loved you all!"" And finally, Music S.T.A.R.T.'s PV begins.  Episode 1: Another Love Live!  We start off with a general assembly as Kotori's mom announces that Otonokizaka will remain open. Honoka becomes the new student council president (with Eli's backing and being the leader of µ's the likely reasons that helped her win the election. Kinda funny because Honoka's not really student council president material). She messes up her speech, wasting Umi's and Kotori's efforts in helping her with it. Eli has faith, however. She believes Honoka can do it, and that's why she recommended her. News of another Love Live reaches Hanayo who goes idol otaku mode and searches for Honoka (who teleports from one place to another because magic) along with Maki, Rin, and Nico. This time, however, the competition is per region, meaning the best of each region will be the ones to compete. Bad news for µ's since they'll have to face A-RISE in the prelims. Everyone wants to participate except for Honoka which is a surprise since she should've been the most excited one. The group is worried about Honoka and tries to find a way to convince her to join. Nico challenges Honoka to a race to the top, which ends in failure as Nico trips. The girls finally discuss the matter and Honoka finally realizes it'll be the seniors' last chance to be school idols. She finally agrees, but instead of just participating, they're gonna aim for the top. And thus, µ's is off once again to reach for their dreams. Oh, and new OP is this episode's ED. I love the song, but SIF does weird things, making you hate songs you should be loving.  Episode 2: Aiming for Victory  More Love Live info! This time teams may only do original songs. No covers. That should narrow down the competition. With only a short time left, there's only one thing µ's can do: training montage! an overnight trip! Once again, Maki's got it covered with a house in the mountains. Umi is excited, as she is a HUGE mountain climbing enthusiast, and Nico once again jealous of Maki.  And as if you can't love Maki enough, she still believes in Santa! She's sooooooo adorable HNNNNGGGG. Anyways, Umi, Kotori, and Maki begin to prepare the lyrics, costume, and composition, respectively. Practice goes well for the remaining members, with Nico and Rin getting more exercise by running down a slope and falling into the river below (thanks, troll squirrel). As Honoka served the two some tea to warm them up, she goes to check the trio's progress. Unfortunately, they disappeared. Honoka finds the three sulking together outside suffering from a slump. Eli decides that everyone should help the three out and splits up into teams. Each subunit team is responsible for lyrics, while Maki and Kotori are still in charge of their tasks. Not much progress as Printemps take a nap, lily white attempted to climb to the summit (poor Rin getting dragged along), and Bibi camped out with Eli staying in the tent, afraid of the dark, and Nico going on a date with Maki giving advice to Maki to get over her slump. As night falls, Umi, Kotori, and Maki finally get ideas and proceed to work. Next morning, the three have disappeared, only to be found sleeping by the piano, done with their tasks. With a song and costumes ready, the girls finally start their practice for the prelims.  Episode 3: Door of Dreams  Practice is going well but the problems stands: there's pretty much only 3 of the 4 spots for the prelims available because of A-RISE. Since their performance is a live stream, there's no room for error, and they have to stand out, whether it be the song, the setting, or the costume. Nozomi jokingly suggests sexy dresses, making Umi fantasize about it. It's always funny to see Umi flustered because of her delusions. Sexy dress BANG! Nico and Rin are so funny to watch too when Rin's comments manage to push Nico's buttons.  Since they'll need support, µ's decides to announce their entry for the Love Live to the school. Maki having connections with the broadcasting committee helped in setting it up. So nice to see her opening up to other people as well, although she's still our lovable tsundere, getting embarrassed once the group finds about her new friends. Making Umi and Hanayo talk through the intercom was a nice idea as it would help them gain confidence and get over their stage fright. As µ's continue to look for a venue for their performance, they end up going to UT-X, where A-RISE's leader, Kira Tsubasa, finds Honoka and drags her into the school. This sets up a chance meeting with their biggest rivals, who were also their supporters, after being noticed in the previous Love Live. They offer µ's to perform with them at UT-X, which Honoka agrees to, while having the standard ""we won't lose to you"" talk. A-RISE performs their new song, Shocking Party, which impressed everyone. Afterwards, µ's prepares for their turn and gets visited by students from Otonokizaka, led by Hideko, Fumiko, and Mika. Seeing them, the girls get pumped and performs Yume no Tobira on stage. It's a really amazing song, and I think it fits well with their situation as they're trying to reach their dreams of entering Love Live and this could be the door leading them to it. The songs ends, leaving A-RISE impressed. Will it be enough for them to get in?  Episode 4: Best Idol in the Universe  Results are out! µ's didn't make it! Well, in Honoka's dream they didn't. Back to reality, it's deja vu, but the results say otherwise. µ's makes it through! With everyone in high spirits, practice continues. But, Nico is nowhere to be found. Seems like she's leaving early a lot lately. The rest of the girls follow her, finding her buying groceries which leads to speculations on why Nico is acting that way. Part time job? Cooking dinner for someone? Or worse, a lover??? Well, the first and second years get caught snooping, and the chase for Nico begins. Nozomi and Eli manage to find Nico but she manages to escape the washi (this scene made me watch Love Live). Eventually, Nico gets away. With no idea where she lives, the chase ends. Luck has different plans though. They meet Nico's little sister, Cocoro, who recognizes them as Nico's ""backup dancers."" Woops, Nico's screwed. They find where she lives and meet little brother, Cotaro, who calls them ""backup dancers"" once again. Nico arrives to see the girls inside. She tries to escape, but her other little sister, Cocoa, unintentionally blocks her path. Nico explains why her siblings thought that way. Believing she was still a ""super idol,"" Nico didn't want to let the kids know of what really happened. She did form the Idol Study Club and had members, but her extreme love for idols distanced her from the members and was too serious in to becoming an idol. Years pass and she was left alone in the club. Leaving Nico's home with her backstory coming to light, the girls help her solve the problem. They put together a mini concert for Nico's siblings to watch Nico perform one last time as a solo idol before finally clearing up that she's part of µ's now. With things sorted out (hopefully), the road to Love Live continues.  Oh, and props to Soramaru for voicing all 3 Yazawa siblings. It's amazing how she can change voices."

All of those total to 7. 1 daily each day most likely a minimum of 2 with the bonus daily unless I decide to do an album...

onetrueidol,39rviq,Overlord3k,3,Sun Jun 14 03:48:20 2015 UTC,"Kinda late this week. AnimeNEXT took my weekends and I got sick last Monday. Anyways, here goes!  Episode 9: Wonder Zone (screenshots)  Kotori's time to shine! So all the hints from the previous episodes finally come to play. We find out Kotori is the legendary Akiba maid Minalinsky. It's really funny seeing Kotori getting flustered after getting busted.   μ's is steadily climbing the ladder. They're getting noticed more and more, even having merchandise of themselves being sold in the nearby idol shop. To keep the hype going, Eli plans a live performance in Akiba, with Kotori writing the song this time. Hitting a dead end, Honoka and Umi help out a struggling Kotori by working at the maid cafe, thinking that this could give Kotori ideas on what to sing about. The result? one of the most annoying songs in SIF Wonder Zone. Another successful performance! Nothing can stop μ's now! Or maybe there is? Just what is in that letter addressed to Kotori?  Episode 10: No Senpai Allowed! (screenshots)  So what's in the mail Kotori got? Let's worry about that later. It's obligatory beach episode time! The perks of having a rich friend, much like how in K-ON!, HTT relied on Mugi's summer villa for their training. This is actually my favorite episode of S1 because of all the development this episode gave: destroying the senpai/kouhai barrier and bringing them closer to each other, and Maki starting to open up to the others with the help of Nozomi. And of course, the pillow fight. Umi wrecking everyone with her supersonic pillow, then Maki and Nozomi saving Rin and Hanayo from demon Umi. In the end, they gre closer together, with Maki thanking Eli for her idea.  Episode 11: The Greatest Concert (screenshots)  With the training camp finished, everyone's in high spirits. Adding to that, they're finally in the top 20! Now they focus on putting an amazing performance at the school festival to keep that spot for the Love Live. But things just start to go wrong from there. Nico loses the lottery, preventing them from using the auditorium (memories of getting bad draws in SIF come to my mind watching this part). Next, there's still the letter Kotori recceived. Turns out she's invited to study abroad to follow her dreams of being a fashion designer. Maybe it's time to talk to Honoka and the rest about the matter, but she chooses to keep it from everyone until the concert was over. Kind of a bad decision on her part, to be honest. They could've dealt with it already if she spoke up. Finally, Honoka being optimistic and motivated is always good, but when's she's too motivated, things go wrong. Seriously, the moment Honoka went out in the rain at night justs to put some more training in, I just shook my head while thinking, ""this isn't gonna end well."" So Honoka ends up getting sick but persists on performing. She holds her ground and finishes No brand girls with an ""OH YAY!"" before finally fainting from her fatigue. With one girl down, what'll µ's do now?  Episode 12: Friends (screenshots)  To be honest, this episode was also one of the reasons I was late in finishing this week's episode list. I get too depressed when an episode is sad as hell. If I got into Love Live when this was the latest episode, I would've stopped watching it for weeks because of how depressed I'll be. That's how good the story is, it hits you hard. Plus it flips around being cheery to gloomy so many times in the episode. MY HEART CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH!!!  After the concert, the girls decide to check up on our little Honkers to see that she's back to being the ball of energy she is. Bad news is, µ's drops out of the competition. But at least their initial goal was met, their performances attracted more students to apply to Otonokizaka. The school is safe and will not close down. The group celebrates, hopefully to cheer up Honoka as well, but there was one more thing that had to be said, Kotori has to leave and study abroad. Everyone except Umi, who had known about it, was shocked. µ's is losing a member and Honoka has lost all will to continue and quits. Nico is furious, stating how she put her faith in Honoka only to be left behind once again. As Maki stops Nico while Honoka walks away, SLAP goes Umi, calling Honoka ""the worst.""  Episode 13: µ's Music Start! (screenshots)  I have to say, I didn't realize until now that the background music in the beginning of this episode is a slowed down Bokura wa Ima no Naka de. It's so relaxing to listen to it. The actual title is ""Atarashii Basho he"" after looking for it in the OST.  With Honoka quitting, there's nothing else to do for µ's. Eli decides to put the group on hiatus (not as bad as HiatusXHiatus, Togashi pls). Nico doesn't accept and continues practice along with Hanayo and Rin. Everyone's going their separate ways. Is this the end of µ's?   MVP trio invites Honoka to hang out with them, hoping to cheer her up. They play DDR Dance Explosion Apocalypse Mode Extra, and despite spacing out the first few seconds of the song, Honoka manages to get a high score, showing that all her practice has made her this good. As they went home and separated, Honoka finds out A-RISE won the Love Live. She begins questioning herself if she would ever find something else that'll make the people around her happy. Later on, Eli visits her and opens up to Honoka. She tells how despite being seen as calm and collected, she was masking her  true self, one that is always lost and didn't know what to do. She also thanks Honoka for saving her by asking her to join µ's. At this point, Honoka sees the error of her ways and meets Umi at the auditorium to apologize. The two make up, with Umi saying she only got mad at Honoka for lying to herself and what she wants to do. Honoka chases after Kotori and talks to her to come back. How she got to the airport to catch Kotori before she left, I will never know.   As Honoka and Kotori return to the school, µ's reunites for one more live. Singing START:DASH!!, the 9 girls once again stand together on stage, with a new goal. µ's music start!"

onetrueidol,38vmp0,Overlord3k,5,Sun Jun 7 05:19:07 2015 UTC,"Just finished eps 5-8. Gonna post some screenshots and a few words on each episode.  Episode 5: Nico Attacks  Now I really dont like Nico as much as the rest, but it's still sad to know she's been alone in the club for the past 1-2 years. Gotta hand it to Honoka and the gang (mostly Nozomi because she's pulling the strings here) to get Nico to join in. If you can't talk them into joining, you make them feel needed so they cave in. Hanayo going full otaku on Nico's collectibles is always funny. She goes from timid to full fangirl in a blink of an eye.   Honoka gets owned on the forehead  Alternate version GO AWAY! Alpacas will knock you out with their fluffiness Nico-Nico-Ni!!!! GTFO Kotori awfully worried about that Minalinsky autograph. Who could Minalinsky be? That smiling Maki Who can resist that wink? Congratulations! Nico joined the party! Little Umi is sooooo cute MOUUUUU!   Episode 6: Who is the Center?  A very important episode IMO, and a really good one too. It really shows how good Honoka is in pulling people to her, despite being clueless about it, but I guess that's why it works. Nico's plans backfiring on her was just funny to watch. Singing contest? Tied. Dancing contest? Close (except for Hanayo, who was terrible at it). Flyer giveaway? Kotori takes the cake (I wonder why wink). Lots of good Maki screentime too. Finally, they perform Korekara no Someday, really catch song especially the full version. Seriously, give each solo version a listen, it's amazing. Hanayo with the cliffhanger ending talking about an emergency!   Rin can be a perv with that camera Didn't even notice that picture in Kotori's bag until now Maki Maki! MAKI MAKI! First year interview Who cares, Nico? Training complete! Mada mada mada korekara! DAREKA TASUKETEEEEEEEEEEE!!!   Episode 7: Elichika (CHIKA!) (This comic with Eli going ""CHIKA!"" has stuck to me. Check these ones out, they're hilarious.)  So coming off of episode 6, we finally find out about the Love Live, where school idols gather to battle it out to be the best school idol ever, or something along those lines. Honkers and the gang want to join but lo and behold, Eli (CHIKA!) once again disagrees. Seriously, accept your fate and join the party already! Mrs. Minami gives our girls the go but on one condition, everyone must pass the exams. That's easy. But if you're Honoka, Rin, or Nico, then it probably might not be. So, the group goes on a study session to whip these girls into shape. Nozomi offers her hand (literally) to help Nico study. We also finally find out it was Eli (CHIKA!) who was taking those videos and uploading them on the internet (How she managed to take those without getting caught, I will never know). Plus, she's actually a good dancer because of ballet lessons ever since she was young, so her comments about how every school idol is an ""amateur in her eyes"" has some backing considering the years she spent on dancing. Anyways, everyone passes (the fail trio barely) and they can move on. However, Mrs. Minami gives the bad news: Otonokizaka will stop accepting applications for the next school year. OH NO!   Our one true idol has groupies! FAN SHOT! Pouting face so cute One reason I love Maki is that she stands up to anyone, even her senpai Honoka, Rin, and Nico are screwed. ZETSUBOUSHITAAAAAAAAAAA! I don't want your BS, Rin Honoka, 7 X 4 isn't 26 >_> Washi washi! (Two links) The culprit is revealed! You're all amateurs Ballerina Eli (CHIKA!) Animation screw up. Practice clothes to school uniforms and back School's closed... ?   Episode 8: What I Want to Do  Otonokizaka is done, game over, go home. Or not. Turns out that's what'll happen if the open campus that's happening in 2 weeks fails. Eli (CHIKA!) and the student council try to find ways to make it succeed. How about letting µ's perform to gain attention? I mean really, they're only the new rising school idol group! But Eli (CHIKA!) is having none of it. She wants a speech noting all the good things the school has, but it's BOOOOOOOOOOOORING, as stated by Alisa and a very sleepy Yukiho. I like how µ's is doing a conference call to talk about what to do. They agree to ask pro dancer Eli (CHIKA!) to train them. She finally caves in and the gang soon realizes how much they really lack. Despite the difficult exercises, the group presses on, which catches Eli (CHIKA!) off guard. Nozomi finally confronts Eli (CHIKA!) about what she really wants to do and how being the student council president shouldn't stop her from doing so. REALLY touching scene and shows that Eli (CHIKA!) really wants to help out. µ's is finally complete with all 9 members and performs Bokura no LIVE Kimi to no LIFE with some training montage going along with the performance in the open campus. What's next for µ's? That'll have to wait till next time!   Open Campus concern ALPACA!!! Rekt Bend over girl! The harsh training won't faze them! Busted ""Do you really expect me to be able to say I want to become an idol now?"" Please join us! µ's Maki with the burn Open Campus performance! Maki is killing it! (4 links) MakiEliUmi top 3! Success!   One more thing, I REALLY love how detailed the lips are when someone has a close up shot. Don't know why, but it's just really awesome to see such detail.   Phew, long ass post. Time to catch up to my other anime to watch."

onetrueidol,352fse,Overlord3k,5,Wed May 6 15:24:03 2015 UTC,Source  It has been 20 days of Maki only dailies which is ending soon. It has been hard but I have managed.  Overall ideas of what I am thinking about doing the next 2 months before the daily finishes.   HonoMaki week MakiNico week double daily week (2 dailies each day) Maybe another lewd week Maybe RinMaki week Maybe μ's week or 8 days of Maki x another μ's member and no idea what I can do for #365....   Any ideas?  I will update the Maki Daily Album within a few weeks and keep it up to date until the end. 2 months left.
onetrueidol,352fse,pitman,3,Wed May 6 15:34:43 2015 UTC,Maybe another lewd week      Maybe μ's week or 8 days of Maki x another μ's member   Want this for obvious reason but too little of what I actually want :P
onetrueidol,352fse,richter_h,3,Wed May 6 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"RinMaki is rare yet excellent pick, MakiNico (a.k.a. mainstream ship) is as good as another, and HonoMaki is always welcome, and personally, favorable. I'd like to see rares like MakiKayo or MakiUmi, and I'll be glad to know if there's any and see how it develops. :D  Double Daily is possible but doesn't it too ...intense?  Anyway, you managed to fulfill the dailies. Kudos for you."
onetrueidol,352fse,richter_h,3,Wed May 6 15:53:23 2015 UTC,It is lot harder to find really good quality fan art of the more rare shipping or at least it takes a lot more work to find them. Major reason I added the idea 'Maybe μ's week or 8 days of Maki x another μ's member' which would include the rare shippings although just 1 daily each girl.   Double Daily shouldn't be that hard in fact I was even considering possibly doing it for the final month...I would probably regret it...idk  And thanks it has been a lot work but I think it has been worth it. While the dailies will stop I will still post something every once in a while.
onetrueidol,352fse,Hourglasspony,2,Wed May 6 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"That's a given, and yes, it's hard indeed to find some quality rare ship artworks out there.   Good luck, fella. Maybe later I'll help with my own artworks, but I don't promise it.  well, at least expect one or two will appear here around."

I'd imagine that for Japanese viewers who don't have that bad connotation of 3D cartoons, it's perfectly fine; technically, the 3D is extremely well-done, it's just the character design that's off-putting. Unfortunately, the 3D scenes are where the music is best. So I'm just doing Cmd-F ""2D"" in the discussion threads to look for gifs, and I'll download the OST when it comes out. A real shame, too... I was looking forward to this.  But hey! There's always Hibike! Euphonium to look forward to! The MC there is a lot like Maki - talented, a tad elitist at times, but lovably awkward at others.

Other seasonings may include garlic, onions, and cumin. Variations, both geographic and personal, involve different types of meat and ingredients. Recipes provoke disputes among aficionados, some of whom insist that the word “chili” applies only to the basic dish, without beans and tomatoes. Chili is a frequent dish for cook-offs, and is used as an ingredient in other dishes.

onetrueidol,2qxwtx,Overlord3k,3,Wed Dec 31 18:54:33 2014 UTC,Source  Almost went with a generic 'Goodbye 2014' title until /u/UltimateEpicFailz stopped me. In less than a week the subreddit will be 6 months old which means I have been posting a Maki daily for almost half a year now. I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I started and I had no idea I would go on for this long. Who knows if I will still be doing it by this time next year I guess only time will tell.   Happy New Year everyone!    Thanks /u/Aruseus493 for the yuri title.
onetrueidol,2qwdfk,PolarisGate,2,Wed Dec 31 06:49:08 2014 UTC,"Honestly I'd suggest just pure muscle memorizing the hands, in other words go through the dailies, find some hands that you think look nice, and trace them 20-30 times. Afterwards you'll start drawing them similar to what you traced."

Thanks /u/Aruseus493 for the title of all 3 posts.  edit: Finally updated the Maki album with all the dailies.

onetrueidol,2oif9j,UltimateEpicFailz,2,Sun Dec 7 06:44:55 2014 UTC,No. You get custom flair for participating/winning subreddit contests or doing something mindblowing like winning a rare Maki card in SiF (but we've already had like 3 of those so no more flair that way). We don't hand those out like pamphlets.
