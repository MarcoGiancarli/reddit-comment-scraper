No, actually. I'm liberal and I think people have the right to do with their own bodies whatever they like without the state even knowing about it or interfering in any way, and I am not the only one to think that way.    The implicit assumption in this question is that same-sex activity is inherently harmless, but not everyone believes that. Muslims, for example, believe that certain sexual activities are deeply destructive — spiritually, mentally, and physiologically — to the person doing them, even if the person is physically enjoying him or herself.   Yes, and that's based on superstition, ignorance and prejudice.  Edit to add:   For example, is it immoral for a person to daydream and fantasize about brutally raping and murdering someone? It's just a daydream, so no actual consequences or physical harms result from that momentary act of imagination. But most of us would be at the very least disturbed by this, even if we cannot articulate why in purely consequentialist terms.   Yes, I'd be disturbed, but it would not be immoral, and I would not have the right to punish a person for daydreaming like that.  Edit 2:  I've given up, I can't bring myself to finish this article. It's so full of bullshit. He just keeps going on about how Western morality also puts limits on sexuality, as if that excuses the oppressive limits of Islam, and he still hasn't said what exactly it is that's wrong with homosexuality.

Anyone?  The reality is there was a huge cultural shift in Christianity due largely to exposure, imo, and many US Muslims probably didn't get the same exposure because, you know, they basically spent 2000-2010 waiting for a lynch mob to show up.

The vast majority of Muslims live in/come from cultures that are significantly less accepting of homosexuality than our liberal Western culture. Even if Islam played a large role in formation of those cultures - and given the extreme hatred towards gays in many Christian cultures in similar parts of the world, this is by no means certain - they cannot now be disentangled.  As religious people integrate into more liberal cultures, they often dispense with or de-emphasize many of their most discriminatory views. This has occurred with many young liberal Muslims I know. It is by no means clear to me that religion is a more important driver of these attitudes than culture."
ainbow,3e1x0v,1of42,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:28:52 2015 UTC,It's an interesting question but I don't see how it is relevant. Whatever the cause is that the only way for Muslims today to become more accepting of LGBT people is for the religion to change it's stance or for people to leave the religion in droves. And that seems to me like it was a much easier task with Christianity than it will be with Islam.

Anyway, I think the important piece you're missing here is that religions rarely yield to external influences driving the creed toward reform.  However, when people within the religion, who are scholars and active practitioners, can hold up interpretations that draw from canon text but have nuanced interpretations that differ from the orthodoxy...  That can be a game changer.  So, it'll be interesting to see how the various sects of Islam manage the issue over the next decade...  Hell, it took Christians roughly 2000 years... ;)"

Honestly, I appreciate posts like these getting traction or people seeing them. I dealt with attitudes that were more irritating than this on a regular basis in the past and the problem is that because a lot of Muslim communities are very insular, people can parrot things like this back and forth and have everyone around them agree and as a result of that, never see any issue with this.   Of course this is a problem with insular closed communities in general and not just related to Islam, but in general, yeah, this is right.

Not so in Islam, where everything must be taken literally.   Jesus also vied for separation of church and state, as in Mark 12:17 ""And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him."" where you could still be a Christian despite the political climate, making religion more of a personal affair between individual and God.

There is no cherry-picking. There is an objective rule here, that of total submission, no true Scotsman fallacy does not apply.  When someone says ""I submit to all of these tenets, but I disagree on this one"" that is called Kibr, and it's of the highest order when it's Kibr against Allah.

It seems likely many who would call themselves christian only interact with the church at births, weddings and deaths, which significantly reduces its influence over them.  I think there's also a distinction to be drawn between religion and a sort of secular spirituality. Increasingly people are happy to say they're not religious, even if they believe in some sort of god or higher power. This is kind of a flaw in way atheist is commonly used (to mean ""not religious""); someone could be a theist while not belonging to a religion, and there are also nontheistic religions.

To me it does seem a bit mad, but I still think it's cruel to shit on them for what is obviously a kind of body dysphoria, especially here.   So what's up with the otherkin hate? I'm genuinely curious. Is there a feeling that they hold an unflattering mirror up to people with other kinds of dysphoria? Is it just that you think it's silly?"
ainbow,3e1x0v,batfiend,8,Tue Jul 21 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"Because it provides ground for the ""slippery slope argument."" Its supposed to be a fallacy, but otherkins sort of reinforce it in regards to trans* people.  Plus you have that whole furry hate aspect of it, along the with the romanticification and sexualization of animals, which most people are not a big fan of.  I guess you can see the biggest public reaction to something similar would be Rachel Dolezel, who identified as trans racial."
ainbow,3e1x0v,friendlysoviet,12,Tue Jul 21 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, I don't know if it is legitimately a form of body dysphoria. I think that as rough as the LGBT community can have it some people are drawn to the idea of being different or being counter cultural so they may create their own thing when they can't actually find a real aspect of their identity that qualifies. So I think it kind of discredits the LGBT community if we start including every ""identity"" that people just make up.   That being said, if people are dealing with mental illness we should not shun them. But at the same time, they should be eventually directed to more appropriate channels since this sub is not relevant to their struggles. If someone came in here saying they had body image problems or body dysmorphia, I'm sure we could find some subs that are relevant to that issue."
ainbow,3e1x0v,nightpanda893,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"Basically, there's a negative reaction to otherkin because they use the language of transgender people to describe a condition which is coming from far further in left-field, since having opposite-sex traits in the brain has a body of scientific backing whereas having heterogeneous species characteristics between body and brain does not / likely will not.    I do not condone by any means bashing on otherkin, and I'm really in no position to tell them how they feel.  If you feel like you are another animal in spirit, then I say more power to you.  If it begins to interfere with functioning, then perhaps some counseling is advisable.  You can't fix body dismorphia stemming from being otherkin like you could with being transgender, so, at least at the moment, the only recourse is in retraining the brain.  Yes, I think it odd, but I still wish people would treat them with more empathy than they usually do."

If being gay and in a loving relationship with another man is an abomination then all I can say is your God's are wrong and you are using your irrational beliefs to control and hurt other people. We need to evolve past the very human need to believe in Gods if we are ever going to survive as a species. And if you want to compare anything to addiction it would be religious belief and the need to have it in your life every single day to be able to exist. IMHO

This can cause discomfort if there are phantom body parts or other oddities.  I think it's entirely plausible that for some people there is discord between how they appear and they feel.  I think you should be a little more open minded and perhaps avoid calling other people's identity or actions bizarre. Only 10 years ago both homosexuality and transgenderism was considered bizarre.

Really, anything that isn't eating, shitting, sleeping, reproducing, or any other basic instinct humans have for survival could easily be considered a social construct. Including gender.  Edit: Though now that I think about it, even the most basic mating ritual from the lowest of animals could be considered a social construct. So would that mean any form of sex that isn't rape is a social construct? I mean society equating rape with being a terrible act is obviously a social construct (as with all morality) and even the concept of consent is a social construct. Considering how common rape is outside of homo sapiens (hell, a lot of animal's dicks evolved to make rape easier, like dogs) all signs point to yes.  Man, these ""social construct"" thought exercises are sure are eye opening.   Maybe that's why there's so much hostility against otherkins? The idea of separating one's humanity from themselves is a pretty scary notion."

I don't think there are enough studies of the other limb feelings which otherkin can experience to be certain if there is a relationship to phantom limb syndrome. I can call it something else if that is useful. Importantly, it can cause suffering and, even if it is a trick of the mind, does need to be considered seriously.  I'm really not sure what you mean about being at the bottom of the food chain.   My point was very simple. Some people lie outside of the average for the population.

They claimed the ability to create another person in your mind. I had a look at some of the guides on how to do it, and felt a really intense desire to do it. Like ""I am fully aware that resisting this for more than a few days is beyond my abilities"". I did some research to address some ethical and safety issue I had, but I couldn't stop myself from starting the process while I was still researching. Turns out my ethical and safety concerns weren't a problem, which was good because I was well aware I wouldn't be able to stop myself anyway. Took a few months(?), but now I have someone else in here with me. I regret nothing.

No one knows how species dysphoria comes about. Given the overrepresentation of trans people among otherkin I would guess they are related conditions, and certainly kintypes have to have some level of nuture instead of nature.  I have discussed the matter with my psychiatrist. Hopefully I should be getting a referral to a psychotherapist from him soon.

I have a number of wetware issues myself (I'm on the AS spectrum, for one) and I've encountered this sort of phobic denial-ism many times. Very often it seems related to cultural ideas about how people really are and really function - ideas that predate Darwin and the Scientific Method, not to put too fine a point on it.   You are reacting to them as if their expression of difference was a threat to you. That's common. Common enough to have a name; Xenophobia. It's also common that people create elaborate rationalizations to justify their fears.  Take Apartheid, for example. Talk about* elaborate.* And yeah, I just went there. Because it was batshit crazy to think about and an evil thing to do.   Now, you think it's crazy for them to think they ""should"" be a winged anthropomorphic winged fox. Maybe. It's certainly uncommon - and to the degree that it impairs their daily functioning, it is perhaps a disorder.   However, feeling threatened by the existence of someone who thinks they are really a winged fox who, nonetheless, is not visibly that sort of thing at all speaks more to your issues than theirs. Given the tendency for xenophobia to affect all aspects of a person's life and cause them to rationalize harming others, I would suggest that your condition is one that meets the criteria of ""likely to harm others"" far more easily.  It is not rational for you to feel threatened by them. It is rational for them to feel threatened by you - and xenophobia in general. They (and I) have experiences that prove that to be a rational concern."

ainbow,3e1x0v,shakedogshake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:12 2015 UTC,"Let me adjust the direction to this. There are any number of non-nurotypicalities that have been integrated into different cultures in different ways.   In other words, there is the raw experience itself, and then there is how a person who experiences reality in that way makes sense of it and how they are permitted to express that, if at all.  I'm on the autistic spectrum. But that doesn't tell you a lot, the more you look into autism, the less you know about it. The saying is ""If you've met one autistic person - you've met one autistic person."" I personally prefer saying ""I'm autistic"" to ""I'm a person with autism"" because I can't separate myself from autism. It would be like saying ""I'm a person with blondness.""  But there are a constellation of traits that, if you pick the diagnostically required number at random, can set you at angles to common experience.   People simply do not readily understand sensory processing issues or fine motor control issues - and these are fairly concrete and things we can actually measure. People prefer to assign terms like ""antisocial"" or ""lazy,"" when it's actually a measurable, neurological issue.  Needless to say, things become more difficult when it's a phenomenon that isn't currently provable. However, there have been FMRI studies with multiple personalities and I'd freakin' LOVE to stuff a bunch of otherkin in one. For Science! That's not activism - that's sheer curiosity.   But the issue is that there is the phenomenon itself, whatever it may be; and then there is how the person themselves makes sense of it. That always comes from culture - where else could it come from? So, obviously, people who live in shamanic cultures have a different reaction to being multi or otherkin - and even more importantly, the culture reacts differently to them.   But knowing something of a culture - and then seeing the same thing manifest in that culture, or this other culture and our own culture(s), we can see there are commonalities. And no, this isn't just a Tumblr truth; there's some serious work being done.  The real point here is that it's some part of normal human variation - something that deserves curiosity and investigation, mitigation where it's a problem - but it's really not all that weird."

It can be a mental disorder though -- I have species dysphoria, which is fucking awful, so that's enough for it to cross the line into a proper mental disorder. Only a minority of otherkin have species dysphoria though.  For me at least, being trans and being otherkin feel exactly the same. I have the same blend of body and social dysphoria for both, and they cause the same distress when things don't match and the same euphoria when they do. Trans people are actually waaay overrepresented among otherkin, which implies the conditions are linked. Obviously you can't have an animal brain the way you can have a male or female brain, but even if they have different root causes I would be stunned if they didn't share a mechanism of action.

Do you take on the romanticized animal persona, or do you take on actual characteristics of your animal persona?   Bizarre was probably a poor choice of words, and I'm sorry. I'm just truly fascinated by things that fall outside of ""normal."" Please don't get mad, I want to hear more about the cross sectionalism of your trans* and otherkin identity."
ainbow,3e1x0v,friendlysoviet,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:46 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of psychologists calling it a form of escapism. I've heard it  referred to as an unusual coping mechanism or just an unusual identity in cases where there is no species dysphoria. In my particular my psychiatrist thinks it might be a form of body dysmorphia (though I think he might have misinterpreted some of what I said. Stupid half hour sessions aren't enough for anything grumbles). Regardless, I have been through the while psychiatric evaluation to make sure I really am trans, and it is definitely not a form of escapism for me. Hell, half the time they are the things I'm trying to escape from.  My species and gender identies sort of operate independently. I always feel like a female fox (well, winged anthro fox. I feel that I should note that I did not choose for that to be my kintype.), but my dysphoria about not looking like it comes in waves. So one day I might not care that my body is wrong, and another day my gender might be a huge deal but my species isn't, and then another they might both be causing dysphoria. I'm not sure what you mean by romanticize.  That's totally fine! I love talking about this stuff, it's a fascinating topic for me."
ainbow,3e1x0v,71abf29,7,Tue Jul 21 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"I've heard it referred to as an unusual coping mechanism or just an unusual identity in cases where there is no species dysphoria   Ah, I must've equated coping mechanism with escapism.    winged anthro fox.    By anthro, you mean like those furry guys, right?    My species and gender identies sort of operate independently.    So do you identify as a trans female fox or just a female fox? Does your trans human dysphoria ever happen at the same time as your species dysphoria? Oof. Sounds like a weird out of body experience, or the movie Akira. Sorry you have to go through that, Tetsuo."
ainbow,3e1x0v,friendlysoviet,4,Tue Jul 21 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, pretty much standard furry in form (except for the legs, which are digitigrade).  Sorry, I think I was unclear. My levels of dysphoria with regard to gender and species fluctuate independently, but I don't have a separate trans human thing. It is just whether the species part is more important to me or the gender part. These can both flair up at the same time. Occasionally I get tension between them due to stuff like the facial hair/fur thing I mentioned, but in that case the actual way I want to look has fur, but appearing feminine is important enough that I'm willing to remove it so that my human body looks more feminine, even if that isn't the body I wish I had.  I have seen Akira, but have apparently repressed those memories :p"
ainbow,3e1x0v,71abf29,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"My levels of dysphoria with regard to gender and species fluctuate independently, but I don't have a separate trans human thing.   I'd like to point out that there are structural differences made apparent in brain scans of those with gender dysphoria. No such standard of comparison exists for other species, simply because our humanity is not a social construct like gender is."
ainbow,3e1x0v,shakedogshake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, while gender roles / expectations are certainly a social construct, sex is not.  Now, the possibility of someone having brain activity from another species is basically zero, whereas having brain activity resembling that of the opposite sex is not.  If this is in fact what you wished to highlight, then I apologize."
ainbow,3e1x0v,OtterSigma,5,Tue Jul 21 16:47:40 2015 UTC,You don't need to apologize for clarifying what I didn't quite convey (but meant to) the first time around. ;)
ainbow,3e1x0v,shakedogshake,0,Tue Jul 21 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"This is true. I would imagine that the difference is that I think like a girl (because I have a female brain), but I don't think like a fox. Note that genderfluid people are a thing, so clearly dysphoria isn't being caused (or at least not being caused much) by gendered brain structure."
ainbow,3e1x0v,71abf29,5,Tue Jul 21 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting.   So do you get dysphoria for not having six nipples on your stomach? Or is your identity have no grounds in actual real world foxes, and resides entirely in furry culture?   How deep were you into furry culture before you identified as otherkin? Did Disney's Robin Hood play a role in this identity?"
ainbow,3e1x0v,friendlysoviet,-14,Tue Jul 21 15:26:20 2015 UTC,"That's kind of an odd situation. My kintype has human-style breasts. A single pair, always visible, etc. But this is something that has pissed me off in furry art for as long as I can remember. Anatomical realism is a big part of my aesthetic sense w.r.t furry art, but my actual kintype has human style breasts, big freaking feathered wings, and a muzzle that is just a little bit too wide for a fox.  I've never been part of furry culture. I liked furry art, but I rarely looked at it because if I looked at it for too long I felt horribly sick. Dysphoria, I guess, though I never identified the cause until after I realised I was otherkin.  I vaguely remember watching Robin Hood when I was young, but I don't recall it having any special impact on me."
ainbow,3e1x0v,71abf29,15,Tue Jul 21 15:45:17 2015 UTC,How can you feel dysphoria for the form of a creature that doesn't exist?

The UK papers were also obsessed with outing MP's or famous people well into the 90s   San Francisco became America's ""gay mecca"" primarily because so many gay people were discharged from the army from the 40s onwards and dumped at San Fransisco unable to go home because of their tarnished reputations. When the goverment did internal sweeps, they would get gay men to write down the names of all the other gay men they knew. In NYC especially entrapment was also a big problem.   18 and 19 year olds would be entrapped in a bathroom or bar and have their whole future ruined. The Stonewall riots were largely a congregation of homeless youth with nothing left to lose and a lot of bitter rage; I don't really know what they were expecting to happen after constantly flooding the streets with homeless gay youth with noting left to lose.   Sadly we are seeing similar things happen in Uganda and many other places today."
ainbow,3e2r9e,Neurotic-Neko,6,Tue Jul 21 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a trans woman who's long been uncomfortable with drag on a personal level.  I'm working to evolve my views, but I'm definitely among those who feels as though drag environments are hostile to people like me.  That said: that's my shit to deal with.  The onus is on me to tolerate those who make me uncomfortable, especially when what they're doing is an earnest and genuine articulation of themselves.  I'm not about to tell anyone they can't do their thing just because people might confuse them for me, and I'm damn sure not going to say that an event for all of us shouldn't feature all of us.  Whenever these differences arise we've got to err on the side of unity and tolerance.  There are folk who don't want my ""T"" in the pride alphabet soup, people who want to exclude any woman who's so much as touched a penis from the term ""lesbian,"" people who insist on ""taking back"" a slur against me that I don't think they've earned the right to.  We can argue about all of these things -- and girl, do we argue -- but we have to stick together as we do.  No exclusion, no exceptions.  Free Pride Glasgow is trying very hard to do right by my corner of the community and in the short-term it's a great show of support, but that support is misguided.  In the long-term I think it'll do nothing but weaken our community as a whole while ostracizing another little corner of it that just doesn't deserve another trip under the bus.

ainbow,3e2r9e,wwjbrickd,6,Tue Jul 21 16:06:47 2015 UTC,We can certainly agree on that.
ainbow,3e2r9e,maleia,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:11:26 2015 UTC,So basically if I'm understanding this correctly some trans people feel that other people's gender and critique of the gender binary calls their gender into question therefore rather than engaging in dialogue the decision was made to exclude another marginalized group. There's a genuine discussion to be had about the terms that drag queens use because since they often embrace their outsider status they often also embrace terms that have traditionally been used to disparage people whose gender varies in any way from Transgender people to cross dressers to drag queens. Can hurtful word ever be truly reclaimed and if so how can this be done without hurting other members of the community? Basically I agree with all of the points made in the video. My biggest issue is that the decision feels like the community is once again trying to distance itself from the members who don't want to play nice and just try and blend in with hetero society.
ainbow,3e2r9e,wwjbrickd,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe, or maybe they just happened not to hire any drag people.  It's really hard to get intent from   This is why, after much discussion, the trans and non binary caucus decided not to have drag acts perform at the event."
ainbow,3e2r9e,Meowsticgoesnya,3,Tue Jul 21 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"Dialogue HAS been made, it just didn't include specifically you.  Does every decision on Earth need to include every human being?  Transgender people's literal safety is constantly in on thin ice, and yes, using hurtful language embracing it by one group that is perceived as being a part of the whole group, does not help.  A drag performer can take off the wig and make-up at the end of the show.  And I'll go as far as to say in most cases you won't recognize who that is in their daily life.     blend in with hetero society.   That's likely the most offensive thing you can say in this context.  Many of us want to ""blend in"" purely because it's safer.  Sorry, but I don't want to be beaten for going to the bathroom, or stabbed because I ""trapped"" some insecure shithead.  It's really funny you say that because Drags GET to blend in when they aren't in a safe place to perform.  I find it hard to accept that Drags live with this constant fear every day that they might be outed and physically harmed.  ""It's just a show"" ""I'm just here for the money"", etc excuses, at least could get you out of an assbeating.  What the fuck would I say?    And no, no trans person is trying to be ""a man in a dress""; but so many people that do not understand the difference only see us that way.

ainbow,3e2r9e,maleia,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"I never said that I should be consulted before they make a decision, what I meant was that instead of excluding the group maybe they could have had a public discussion panel to bring these issues to a wider audience rather than having the discussion solely as a task force behind closed doors. As for drag queens being able to blend in, that may be true for some people but many queens got into drag because they stand out and don't blend in and it was a way for them top build a community and critique the system that mocked them for not trying to force themselves into societal ideas of who and what a man should be."
ainbow,3e2r9e,wwjbrickd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"You're still acting like they didn't have a discussion about it already.  Again, just because you weren't privy to those discussions doesn't mean it did or didn't happen.  The biggest bit of discussion to happen, happened when Ru Paul wouldn't back down from using 'tranny' and other slurs.  It was front and center, and many points of the discussion was made there.  I guess you were in a hole in the ground, because their attitudes and views pretty well cemented the fate of Drags as being phased out.  And all of that, was very much out in the open."
ainbow,3e2r9e,maleia,6,Tue Jul 21 19:02:10 2015 UTC,No I was there for that conversation though I stayed out of it because I'm not sure how I feel about reclaiming words. I'm just saying I don't believe it's okay to end the dialog without coming to a better solution than exclusion.
ainbow,3e2r9e,wwjbrickd,0,Tue Jul 21 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"Pride without drag isn't pride at all, IMO. Banning drag events is a terrible idea and contrary to what pride should be about."
ainbow,3e2r9e,theguesswhat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:12 2015 UTC,I think this misleading title is a very effective way to try and divide the LGBT community.

ainbow,3e2r9e,maleia,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"But posting incorrect and misleading information is giving that information credibility.  Drag performers aren't being banned, the pride organizers simply aren't paying for any performances.  They specifically stated that people are welcome to come in full drag if they wish.  That's a huge different from ""Drag is banned""."
ainbow,3e2r9e,maleia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:57 2015 UTC,"The title technically does not mention free pride Glasgow though. Most of the content isn't exclusively relevant just to free pride Glasgow either. Questions over these topics have been rather common place, almost seemingly since the first inception of pride. Unfortunately much of the conversation around these questions has been knee jerky and reactionary. I feel that this video does a good job of presenting both sides and, hopefully, will allow for calm discussion of this matter. I do hold my own views on this matter and worried changing the title would put my views in front of the videos, impacting the video's message."

While the hotel was wrong for calling the police just because of how she is dressed, it seems legitimate that you would go to jail for a probation violation. She is not in jail for being trans."
ainbow,3dzb6m,Gay_milhouse,20,Mon Jul 20 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"The title's not wrong, she got the police called on her for being trans, and due to the police being called she's in jail.  And the probation violation charge is fine, but the one for her HRT (since it's unprescribed) is a problem."

ainbow,3dzb6m,nightpanda893,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:14 2015 UTC,On the other hand assuming someone is a prostitute because they're trans? Not OK.
ainbow,3dzb6m,QueerandLoathinginTO,6,Tue Jul 21 17:03:21 2015 UTC,My point is that if she didn't have the pills she would still be going to jail. Police get called for stupid shit by stupid people all the time. That doesn't automatically mean you go to jail. It's the crime that makes you go to jail.
ainbow,3dzb6m,ParanoydAndroid,12,Mon Jul 20 22:46:13 2015 UTC,"If she wasn't trans, she wouldn't be in jail. Once in jail, if she wasn't trans she wouldn't be in solitary confinement. I don't understand the desire to excuse these facts."
ainbow,3dzb6m,nightpanda893,6,Mon Jul 20 23:28:01 2015 UTC,"If she wasn't trans, she wouldn't be in jail.   But using that same reasoning, if she hadn't violated parole or had illegal possession of prescription drugs she wouldn't be in jail either."
ainbow,3dzb6m,QueerandLoathinginTO,2,Tue Jul 21 14:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not excusing anything. But crying wolf makes our community look bad and takes away credibility from actual injustice. Yes, being trans clearly played a role in having the police called which lead to her being arrested. That part was based on discrimination, prejudice, and ignorance. And it's undeniably wrong. But other things, seemingly unrelated crimes, also played a role. Oversimplifying stories doesn't help anyone."
ainbow,3dzb6m,nightpanda893,2,Mon Jul 20 23:52:00 2015 UTC,crying wolf   Standing against discrimination isn't crying wolf when it's trans people we're sticking up for.  That's a pretty shitty accusation to level against people simply for objecting to a situation you accept.
ainbow,3dzb6m,QueerandLoathinginTO,6,Tue Jul 21 01:14:41 2015 UTC,So she would have been let go on the probation violation had she been cis?
ainbow,3dzb6m,nightpanda893,6,Tue Jul 21 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"She never would have interacted with the police at all, had someone not called the police to investigate her gender expression.  So what you're saying is that if I object to the idea that a transgender woman being transgender in public warrants an investigation by the police, I am lying and trying to trick people into thinking that people are being oppressed when they are not, and are responsible for other people's prejudices against them?  That is an extraordinarily shitty judgement to pass on people simply because they object to a situation that you are cool with.  Reacting to someone expressing a viewpoint you don't share by jumping to an accusation of dishonesty and ulterior motive is fundamentally intolerant."
ainbow,3dzb6m,QueerandLoathinginTO,6,Tue Jul 21 03:01:17 2015 UTC,The title is written to make you believe she is in jail for being trans which is not the case.
ainbow,3dzb6m,ohay_nicole,-4,Tue Jul 21 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"You are wrong about that.  Here's the important thing... I'm not going to accuse you of having an ulterior motive and being dishonest simply because of that. I'm not going to tell you that prejudice against you is your own fault for holding the wrong opinion. Doing that would be extremely shitty.  Do you understand what I'm saying here? Simply for having an opinion you did not share, you've accused me of lying, and you have blamed me for prejudice and discrimination. I'm telling you that's a really shitty thing to do.  If you can correct that bullshit you've dumped on top of that issue, then we can have a conversation about whether being trans was a factor in a situation where the police were called to investigate a trans woman's gender expression. Then, you can try to justify your asinine and transphobia denialism. Until then, you're just someone who can't handle queers sticking up for themselves.  Am I being unclear? It's ok with me if we disagree. It's the bigotry of your false accusation which is inappropriate."
ainbow,3dzb6m,nightpanda893,5,Tue Jul 21 03:53:23 2015 UTC,"The cynical response is: Of course not, because she's also black.  Did the cops run her name because she's black/trans, where they wouldn't have bothered otherwise? It's a possibility."

Welcome to humanity.   Using a google image search for ""androgyny"" as an indicator that a certain type is idealized is hardly a good source. If you play a word association game with random people and say ""androgyny"", I'd be willing to bet (of those people who know what the word means), 2/3 say ""David Bowie"" and 1/3 say ""Pat"".

The Norrie case, although it mandated that NSW recognise a legal non-binary gender, isn't relevant to the interpretation or application of the Marriage Act. As far as the Act is concerned only men and women can marry - and only if, legally, they are opposite sex; how they get there isn't relevant. Mind you, we did things arse-about from the way it's happening in America; the trans community up there is fighting for federal non-discrimination protections, and it's been a nasty fight, but down here they got it two years ago and there wasn't a whisper of controversy.  Fortunately all the proposed fixes to the Marriage Act change the language to ""two persons"" and explicitly say something like ""regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity""."

Hillary and Sanders positions are very similar. I know Sanders voters like to paint Hillary as a monster, but thats not really the real picture. I am old enough to remember Bill Clinton term, he was very good at economy and the country lived their best moment. In fact the middle class experienced a very good time during the 90's, then Bush ruined and crashed everything.

She's said repeatedly that she believes that ""marriage is not just a bond, but a sacred bond between a man and a woman"".   If all that matters is homophobia, Hillary really isn't much better than any Republicans.   Bernie, on the other hand, has been fighting for LGBT rights for 32 years. So he seems to be kinda okay with LGBT people. At least a lot more than Hillary ""my marriage to a man who's cheated on me multiple times is more sacred than the relationship of two gay men who've been with each other for decades"" Clinton."

Either she had a genuine change of opinion at a remarkably coincidental time, or she just said she supports same-sex marriage because the majority of the populous won't vote for someone who's against it.   She's not an idiot. She knows she can't get elected if she says she's against same-sex marriage, so she says she's in favor of it. How does she really feel? There's no way to know."

ainbow,3dxapf,eganisdone,4,Tue Jul 21 05:16:30 2015 UTC,All dating or hook up apps are cesspools. Just read through some of the okcupid profiles sometime. The amount of pro-eugenics I see is crazy.
ainbow,3dxapf,yourdadsbff,2,Mon Jul 20 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Blergh. I always knew that Grindr was bad (though not this bad, from what I recall...), but it's really disheartening to hear that about OKC. When I was last on it five or six years ago, I made a ton of good friends and got a really good relationship or two out of it. The abundance of quizzes and questions as filtration system on OKC meant that I very rarely ran into people who were, say, coontown supporters. Am I so old that I can now unironically say that back in my day, people were nicer? Or was I just preternaturally lucky? Both answers kind of suck, and either way maybe my boyfriend and I should just stick to sane, racism-free domesticity with one another."
ainbow,3dxapf,eganisdone,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a good answer and my experience might actually not be representative so you may be right or wrong.   I think the issue is less that people are worse now and more that online dating apps are pretty fundamentally flawed and now that its become more mainstream those flaws are coming forward.   When you're just presented with a picture and some text, even if you know that logically a human is typing those words at you, you don't humanize them unless you really, really try to do so. I don't know if our brains will ever be able to naturally do that. There's just nothing in it that says ""this is a human I'm talking to"", and I think that starts to show.   It's at least one of the reasons why the guy you were talking to could be like ""nah"" immediately, because like a lot of online dating apps, it reduced you as the end user to a series of traits that people could check off. Skin color, height, income status, dick size, sexual experience, etc. Once you do that, it's very easy to go ""oh you didn't meet the white skin criteria I was looking for so see ya"" and just move on.   It's a really fascinating issue and as people start to turn to online dating I think we're going to see it crop up more and more often. Interacting with people in a semi-anonymous environment is very appealing on the surface because you get to protect yourself very easily. You don't even need to be polite if you don't like the person.  You don't need to look or respond to anyone you think isn't attractive. You can filter and organize every interaction you will ever have through those apps and never once think about hurting someone's feelings with it. And while this is a really superficially appealing deal, it's just not how we form relationships, not as a whole.  Because you can protect yourself so thoroughly, because you can filter out all of these people and make snap judgments not just on their appearance but on their ability to take a photo (I'm a little bitter about that I'll admit, I'm awful at photography and I never ask people to take my picture so for a long time my dating profile was just my mustache), you build a wall around your vulnerabilities. Once you do that, you're immensely decreasing your ability to find a good relationship, because sharing those vulnerabilities and building that trust is what forms the foundations of how we interact with everyone. Even if that means you get hurt sometimes, even if it means you go on really terrible dates. And the two worlds are kind of irreconcilable for most people, because the fundamental nature of semi-anonymous communication, whether dating profiles, facebook, reddit, grindr, tinder, yikyak, or anything else out there is to hide those vulnerabilities. Everyone else is putting on their best face, hiding any flaws that they have, and so you have to as well. What kind of relationship could you build out of that?"
ainbow,3dxapf,yourdadsbff,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the thoughtful response! I 100% agree, it's so easy to trivialize people as nothing more than aggregations of statistics. I don't think it's necessarily that reductive -- one of the things I liked about OKC when I was on it was the way it encouraged lots of personality profiling, so you got a decent sense of the other person on the end of the screen (which is why I'm so bummed to hear that it's...not like that anymore) -- but it's certainly disheartening to see callousness becoming more commonplace, no?

If we find a drug or technology that increases people's ability to learn and it raises the general intelligence of the population, that can be done entirely morally. But it's the idea of ""this person is less intelligent, ergo they shouldn't have children"" that people stick to, ignoring all of the circumstances or other talents that the person can bring.  It was also just a huge red flag to me because the other implication is that of course they would never be subject to that program. Because clearly they are smarter than everyone else. It's very selfish and very self-centered and it really, really frustrated me.  Also the surprising amount of people who were just like ""yeah no black guys"" which doesn't affect me personally but means I probably don't want to date you."

Everyone is oppressed in a way that just seems univentive, sexy male movie star is gay, woman is forced into marriage, hip DJ girl meets sleazy guys, transwoman is always doing cute lesbian transwoman stuff until she does sad transwoman stuff, honest cop fighting the blue code and doing the right thing, it's all really cookie cutter and comes off as cheesy. They all seem like charactuers of real people, but not real people.   I applaud the show for having so many characters that you don't see in other shows, but after about three episodes I just felt embarrassed by watching it, it's really cheesy."

ainbow,3dubha,pyrespirit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"The writing isn't overly straightforward, technical, or based around jargon like the older standard model of sci fi. It isn't totally jargon-free either, but doesn't focus on it much. The story unfolds slowly in a way that leaves you wanting explanation. Explanation is no where near as glacial as Lost's 6-year tease, but it has a similar feeling for leaving making sense of the plot to the audience. (Come to think of it, everyone who enjoyed Lost really enjoyed Sense8, so that might actually be a decent simple litmus test.) Visually it's magnificent. The soundtrack is enjoyable. The antagonist is dead simple for lack of explanation but effective.   My only complaints would be that while most dialog is acceptable if not good, certain characters express themselves more simply than I would like. Felix is a cringe train wreck, as is Sun's brother, though at least it fits the latter's character. The implication of sexual impropriety in Wolfgang's plot might actually be weirder than making it explicit. And everyone seems to be bulletproof to a childish degree, which seems kind of irresponsible for portraying guns as harmless. The non-US characters are underdeveloped in contrast to Nomi and Will. Explaining these faults must make them seem more significant than they are in context. Most points of heavy-handedness seem like they might be the result of adapting a childish cliche-filled style of anime to film. Still, there's a lot more to like than fault. The action scenes are all great. Nomi and Will are compelling heroine and hero. Overall it's amazing and definitely worth watching."

I think for a lot of us, it's really great because this is the first show that really feels like it was for us, not just about us. Like they knew how to treat us as audience members instead of material to use. So it makes sense that we would like the show I think.  I think there's a lot more to it than that though, it's a great show even when nomi isn't on screen. And I have the opposite impression than you: it seems like the ones who dislike it don't like it because of all the ""gay stuff.""  I would say give it a shot, it gets really good after episode 4. But if it's not for you that's cool too, I'm just happy to have a show that's for me :)"

If there is a fear to be compared or that people will not understand the difference, it's simple: we have to educate.  Discriminating against someone because you do not want to be associated with them is something that we've all been fighting against all along.

I feel bad for the queens who might have already been working on their outfits and spent money preparing for the show but, at the end of the day, pride is about the community and, if the community votes to cancel something in an effort to be more accommodating to more members of the community, it's really hard to fault them for that."

Of course i've met plenty of drag performers who dont use those slurs, but i can understand this coming from a place where those types of performers are present. Without actually getting a beforehand look at every piece performed i can understand why they would take the position to just outright not have drag performances.  On the other hand, there are, as there are in every single minority group, those who would step on those arond them, and the trans community is no different. If this truly comes from a place of intolerance towards other peoples expression and their own discomfort, thats a pretty fucking massively hypocritical piece of bullshit right there when what you want is people to be accepting of your expression regardless of how discomforting it might be for others.  I'm sick of trans people who behave intolerantly towards drag, transvetisism/crossdressers and genderqueer people based upon their own BS. I've had to listen to enough people who think that drag and glaringly open non-binary people should ""fuck off and die"" because they themselves are upset with being called transvestites or drag queens or simply believe that people who come under the trans umbrella who dont present a ""passing"" binary gender hurt them somehow by making people think about gender outside of a binary mindset.

ainbow,3dtt1n,Fistocracy,6,Sun Jul 19 17:27:33 2015 UTC,And banning drag performances from a pride event because they're not the right expression of gender isn't?
ainbow,3dtt1n,Granny_Weatherwax,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"No. Drag is a performance. It's not a performance without critique from multiple places either. It very possibly does often mock women in gneral and not just expected gender roles, misogyny has played a part in some drag, enough to beg a question about whether drag is inherently misogynistic. It also has a history of being used to erase trans people, this is not a thing that has only happened a few times but rather many many times. Ru paul and his promotion of the acceptance of the usage of the terms ""$hemale"" and ""tr@nny"". It's not enough to ban drag, and it never will be, drag is not being banned, no one is banning drag. Drag done well is great, I don't want to ban drag, even shitty drag, and as someone who has actually hosted trans pride in my city, didn't ban drag, and welcomed drag performers to celebrate with us. Not that you guys will stop arguing against that straw man.   They are actually just asking for no performances during the event, at the event. Are they right? Who knows! Is is a good excuse to come hate on trans people? No, dumbfuckingquestion.  So basically Get over yourself. You're not going to the goddamned festival, you just like to fight with trans people. Your ability to emotionally self fellate by just feeling superior is just not as fun for everyone else."
ainbow,3dtt1n,Fistocracy,3,Sun Jul 19 23:31:11 2015 UTC,"Of course dear. Because everyone who thinks removing drag performances from a pride event is a bad idea is just saying it because they've got a bee in their bonnet about trans activism in general.

I don't know how I feel about drag, I do know that many members of the drag community are in love with using words that trans women often have screamed at them while they are sexually assaulted/regularly assaulted/ beaten to death/dealing with police/ being imprisoned for being trans (it literally just happened!). I don't give a flying fuck what they do in Scotland, not my monkeys not my tree. I however really dislike this baiting bullshit and this thinly veiled trans hate. It's not about this issue, or this instant, maybe you are ok but these other guys and hundreds like them will latch onto ANY excuse to hate on trans people, specifically trans women. So fuck it.

It was a slur originally aimed at both crossdressers (transvestites) and trans people, now suddenly the older generation of drag queens are called transophobes for using a word that was to them, akin to how the black community used the n word.  Of course ultimately the trans community is right and the language changed, but in this case we should be understanding and move towards education not recrimination. It's understandable to be territorial towards a word that was routinely used as a slur towards your community and your community had been reclaiming."
ainbow,3dtt1n,shaedofblue,5,Sun Jul 19 18:03:57 2015 UTC,The first word is complicated.  The second word is a slur that solely refers to trans sex workers and was being used by Ru Paul to refer to drag queens that don't pass.  Not complicated.
ainbow,3dtt1n,AdumbroDeus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:05 2015 UTC,"You wrong, it was in fact used to refer to both transvestites and transgender people. Possibly because outsiders didn't recognize the difference. The use has fallen away however with the use of transvestite fallen away."

But then, there's another big issue. I bet our definitions of ""trans"" vary.   You do know that it's kind of a spectrum - us genderfluids, for instance, who cannot or will not be limited to a binary. I mean, I'm ok with the package I was issued, but I were given a choice I take both (except on days when I'd prefer neither). Many transpersons don't care to muck about with their body plan, for that matter, for reasons of health or the ability to afford it.   Anyway, there's simply no casual way to know for sure who's ""really"" trans or not. But one thing is for certain sure - you don't have the right to demand that other people validate your self-image and self-expression at the expense of their own self-concept and self-respect.  You are here, bashing drag artists because you feel they are bashing transpeople simply by breathing.  There are plenty of real problems; lots of transphobia, plenty of gender panic, all KINDS of pressure to conform to all KINDS of expectations.

Both of them are more out there than Eddy Izzard - and Eddy has been ignoring the gender binary for years and years and  years. Which is even more transgressive than simply vamping the opposite side of the binary.   The point is that they get up on the stage and fuck with their audience's preconceptions of what is appropriate. It's that little gasp and twist, that spit-take that they are going for.   Of course, that's kind of the exact opposite of what some transpeople are wanting. They want to be ordinary shlubs like everyone else, just in the ""other kind of body."" Being conspicuous is no part of that idea.   There are some who know they can't pass but boldly dress the way they feel regardless of how well they can pull it off. That is more akin to drag - but there are lots of gender conforming people who don't do all that well rocking the x or the y either. There are lots of people who'd have to work really hard to pull off a six.   I do kind of agree with RuPaul that life IS drag. I just don't drag it any farther than I have to, because it's a lot of work and the prize for winning isn't anything I want.   But I appreciate the artform."
ainbow,3dtt1n,KlokWerkN,4,Sun Jul 19 20:37:09 2015 UTC,"... You basically just equated non passing trans people to being in drag as well as taking a swipe at everyone who is binary in presentation. This discussion is over, THAT was awful."
ainbow,3dtt1n,graphictruth,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"Presenting as anything is a sort of drag. Drag isn't always social criticism, sometimes it's just who you wish to be seen as. (See also women's business attire in the 80's.) When you put on a persona before you go out the door, that's a performance. It's aspirational to a degree for everyone.   If you wish to be seen as binary female, that's fine. But don't be offended if I point out that the canvas requires different preparation. It's not even a criticism."

Should they not point out language that is transophobic and say that it's transophobic? Should be not shame bigots?  Granted in the T word case it's a slur that originally also applied to the drag community which is where being territorial about it occurred, hence it's somewhat more complicated.  But the concept is sound."
ainbow,3dtt1n,amkamins,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:44:16 2015 UTC,"Too often pointing out 'offensive' language exists in complete absence of nuance, and becomes forceful, polarizing, and hateful.   For example, the word faggot. There's a big difference between a street preacher screaming, ""All faggots deserve hellfire!"" and a pro LGBT comedian like Kathy Griffin using the word in her act."
ainbow,3dtt1n,AdumbroDeus,4,Sun Jul 19 21:48:45 2015 UTC,Are you punching up or punching down?  But it's also understandable for trans people to not want a slur that's almost exclusively used towards their community in this day and age to not be used as a term of endearment that's non-critical in a completely different community.   It's also understandable for there to be residual feelings on it's use because it used to be used for drag queens as well.
ainbow,3dtt1n,pyrespirit,7,Sun Jul 19 21:54:00 2015 UTC,This is the same RuPaul who tries to defend his use of transphobic slurs.  RuPaul is an example of a specific drag performer I do have a problem with.

ainbow,3dtt1n,lolreallyno,2,Mon Jul 20 07:59:31 2015 UTC,"No, they weren't.   The question of who gets credit for starting the riots is one that deserves consideration. The question, however, contains a premise: that an individual or group of individuals can be singled out as the prime mover in a complex process that many persons collectively created. This is important for two reasons. First, as John O’Brien pointed out, there was a continuum of resistance ranging from silent persons who ignored the police orders to move to those who threw objects at the police. O’Brien maintains that it was because of those persons standing around and blocking the streets and sidewalks and keeping the police from being able to operate efficiently that he and others were able to engage in their tactics as effectively as they did: if there had been only about fifteen youths lobbing objects at the police the young men would have been quickly caught or chased away. Second, I wrote the account of the first night to reflect my understanding of what happened, namely, that until the definitive outbreak of rioting when the police retreated inside the Stonewall Inn, there was throughout the evening both a gradual buildup of anger and, correspondingly, a gradual escalation in the release of that anger. In the course of that buildup there were numerous turning points, some more critical than others. With these qualifications noted, I think it is clear that special credit must be given to gay homeless youths, to transgendered men, and to the lesbian who fought the police. Among these, we can name three individuals known to have been in the vanguard: Jackie Hormona, Marsha Johnson, and Zazu Nova.  A common theme links those who resisted first and fought the hardest, and that is gender transgression. While we do not know how the lesbian who fought the police saw herself, we do know that her clothing was masculine, in keeping with her general demeanor. We know from Pine’s testimony that the first significant resistance that he encountered inside the bar came from transvestites, and Joel S. places them among the first outside the bar to resist. Marsha Johnson and Zazu Nova were both transvestites, and, as the reader has seen, the street youth were, generally speaking, effeminate men. All available evidence leads us to conclude that the Stonewall Riots were instigated and led by the most despised and marginal elements of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered community. My research for this history demonstrates that if we wish to name the group most responsible for the success of the riots, it is the young, homeless homosexuals, and, contrary to the usual characterizations of those on the rebellion’s front lines, most were Caucasian; few were Latino; almost none were transvestites or transsexuals; most were effeminate; and a fair number came from middle-class families.   --Carter, David (2010) Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution (pp. 261-262), St. Martin's Press, Kindle Edition"

ainbow,3dtt1n,KlokWerkN,6,Sun Jul 19 14:57:27 2015 UTC,"Another way you can look at it, is that non LGBT people often equate drag to being trans. They are completely different but there's not enough education on behalf of the drag community vs the trans community so a lot of people just think being trans is drag 24/7. I get asked a lot if I want to go to drag events, and to me it's not a costume I get to put on and take off when I want to have fun."
ainbow,3dtt1n,Avalon143,21,Sun Jul 19 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"Simply because people are not educated about something doesn't mean it isn't valuable or potentially a beneficial thing for the community. I think from my experience interviewing and talking with drag queens, at least some within my area, the act of doing drag is much deeper and more powerful to them than simply putting on a costume and having fun. Drag, at its roots, is a subversive act defying rules and stereotypes. Many drag queens begin with subverting societies views of gender and the rigid constructs society associates with gender, but there are other queens who move beyond that and simply see drag as a way of both showing and creating a space for complete and full acceptance while also challenging people to radically be themselves.   Now I am not saying there are not drag queens who simply want to go out and have fun by creating a character, but I think we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water. Drag has done many wonderful and powerful things for the queer community and for us to dismiss it as something trite and trivial is a slap in the face of many of the first queens who instigated the queer rights movements. Gender is a complicated and convoluted issue, and to simplify a drag queen into simply a man dressed as girl, we have severely degraded the complexity of gender and gender identity closer to what society originally started with."
ainbow,3dtt1n,KlokWerkN,-10,Sun Jul 19 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"That's a wonderful interpretation of drag from an educated perspective within the LGBT community but that is NOT how society sees it. No non lgbt person goes to a drag show thinking ""wow this is broadening my understanding of the expression of gender!"". They see a man in an exaggerated female outfit and take it at face value.  People go to drag shows to be entertained while the performers get to show off their extravagance."
ainbow,3dtt1n,Avalon143,10,Sun Jul 19 16:22:27 2015 UTC,"When I take people to drag shows, I always explain where drag is from and what its history is within the queer community. Additionally, in a museum, every piece of art isn't explained, it is simply meant to make you feel. The best drag queens, I think, do this well and make you question the rules and structures of society without necessarily spelling it out for you. And even so, if a queen doesn't do this well, the simple act of being around a group of people are legitimately having fun with a person who is breaking so many gender stereotypes at once, without beating the shit out of them for being gay or a fairy, is a new experience for some people that opens their eyes to a new way of seeing the world. Drag opened, for example, my mother's eyes to the idea that being gay, doing slightly subversive things, and playing with gender could be fun and not perverse or shameful as she had seen it portrayed before."
ainbow,3dtt1n,KlokWerkN,-5,Sun Jul 19 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Its not a great thing for the trans community. I've never seen anything but negativity when trans and drag collide. If you're looking for an abundance of transphobic slurs, go to a drag show. All I heard was tranny and shemale for the whole fucking thing. It's great that it carved out this little space for gay men to enjoy and laugh at tranny jokes at the expense of trans people."
ainbow,3dtt1n,Avalon143,9,Sun Jul 19 16:46:19 2015 UTC,"You must be going to the wrong drag shows because the ones I go to have none of that. I am sorry that you had that experience and in the two cities that I have lived where I have had much of my experience with drag, I have yet to experience a drag show like that. Not to say there haven't been some off color jokes every once in awhile, but it absolutely never felt like a carved out space for gay men to laugh at transgender folk. One specific queen I know even refuses to use the word ""bitch"" in her shows because she believes it is derogatory. The vulgarity that I hear is usually about sex and liberated sexuality and very little about transgender issues. I wouldn't clump all drag shows into a generalization here, because I could also say, in my experience, if you are looking to feel liberated for whoever you are and to feel accepted with whatever body you have, go to a drag show. Maybe search out some different drag venues, or even talk with some of the drag queens you have met and see what their thoughts are on this issue."
ainbow,3dtt1n,KlokWerkN,0,Sun Jul 19 16:53:49 2015 UTC,I really wish I lived somewhere liberal where I wouldn't have to deal with this but not many LGBT live in areas that are so progressive on all levels. For reference I went to a drag show in a Midwest post industrial decline city in Michigan.
ainbow,3dtt1n,Avalon143,6,Sun Jul 19 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm... that is unfortunate. My first drag experiences were in Ohio and we had a great time with great people. I wish more progressive and educated perspectives on Drag were more available everywhere. I hope you won't be completely closed off to drag in the future at other locations, but I can definitely understand being limited in your options."
ainbow,3dtt1n,pyrespirit,4,Sun Jul 19 19:45:33 2015 UTC,Drag performers are not responsible for the ignorance of people.  They don't lose their rights to self expression because bigoted jerks conflate them with transgender people.
ainbow,3dtt1n,graphictruth,0,Sun Jul 19 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"Well, there you go. It's a drag show put on by people within a cultural context. I doubt it's typical - and I doubt that the NY drag scene has a lot in common with that in LA, or Miami, either.  Except that you are going to have people getting on stage, putting on their brave and strip-mining their personal issues in order to put butts in the seats. And ... to DO that ... they are going to use the material that works."
ainbow,3dtt1n,graphictruth,3,Sun Jul 19 20:04:34 2015 UTC,"Pardon me for bringing this up, but at what point did the community give a flying fuck what the Reader's Digest People thought?    People go to drag shows to be entertained while the performers get to show off their extravagance.   You say that as if it were morally questionable. It's fucking parade. People come to watch the extravagance. We have to outdo Mardi Gras!  If they learn something, fine. But it's about the churros and the simple, overwhelming reminder that there are a LOT of queer people out there. People you wouldn't think were queer without the makeup, flags and assless chaps.   It's a pride parade. People get their brave on and are fabulous. Or, so one hopes. Save the ""outreach"" and ""tolerance building"" for the rest of the year. Don't step on the fun.  Gender and Identity IS complex; way too complex to address from a parade float. So, whoever is willing to put on their big girl panties in public should be there. What happened to being able to shrug and say, ""Your Kink Is Ok, It's Just Not My Kink?""   And how can you tell if some queen is gay, trans or as close to cis-het as you can get while dressed like Cher? It's all some value of queer to me - and to ME, that means shattering the closet door on the way out.   What pisses me off are scolds saying what a ""real"" queer is. Seems a lot like defining what a ""legitimate"" gender expression is. And if I want to here that crap, I can find a Baptist almost anywhere.  Look, I really, really get not wanting to be conspicuous, and still want to be seen as a legitimate member of the community. I don't do any of that stuff. I'm some variety of ACE and I really really really hate crowds of any sort. But that's fine,   Seriously, I wish I had a little button that I could press whenever a leftist starts overthinking things. It's a party. Everyone's welcome. If you don't like that sort of thing - don't come.  And if you want to do activism and outreach - hand out fliers."
ainbow,3dtt1n,KlokWerkN,4,Sun Jul 19 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"Please do not think that I'm saying there isn't a place for drag in the LGBT community, I'm simply saying it isn't this great crusader for trans people as it seems.  What I've said is being taken way out of context, being turned into this anti drag message. It's not even about drag itself, it's that other people often confuse drag with being trans or as this over-exaggeration of trans people, and the underlying transphobic message sometimes carried, although unintentionally."
ainbow,3dtt1n,cheese93007,-10,Sun Jul 19 20:16:54 2015 UTC,"Basically drag performance really only works if you consider there to be something inherently funny about a man in a dress/woman in a tux. That's not to say we should force people into gendered clothing (there is nothing wrong with a man wearing a dress for themselves for example), but that the intent behind it is what matters. We had quite a few trans people (women in particular) complain about hosting a drag show, and ultimately decided that if it's making them uncomfortable it shouldn't be a part of our campus LGBT culture"
ainbow,3dtt1n,beta_vulgaris,18,Sun Jul 19 20:20:17 2015 UTC,"What about drag as an art form or as self expression? Drag isn't all about humor. If I, as a gay cis-male, want to express my gender in a non-binary way as a form of performance art, why should the lgbt community not be a safe place for that form of expression?"
ainbow,3dtt1n,cheese93007,-15,Sun Jul 19 15:22:46 2015 UTC,If drag performance was about that it wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately it isn't
ainbow,3dtt1n,beta_vulgaris,11,Sun Jul 19 16:02:46 2015 UTC,What do you mean that's not what drag is about?
ainbow,3dtt1n,cheese93007,-6,Sun Jul 19 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"Drag culture has roots in societal gender roles and transphobia. 905 of the time it's a white cis gay dude doing the performance, and usually it's not a celebration of gender diversity but a mockery of women stereotypes and the shock value of a 'man in a dress.' And this narrative literally kills trans people. I could argue all day about this but knowing the vast majority of trans women at my university were uncomfortable with having drag be a part of our campus queer culture was kind of a wake up call"
ainbow,3dtt1n,beta_vulgaris,9,Sun Jul 19 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"What drag shows are you going to, honey? I've never seen a show that hinged solely on the ""joke"" of a man in a dress.  Drag performance empowers men like myself to embrace the inherent femininity that was often bullied out of us in our youth. When a queen puts on a sparkly gown, a wig, and lip synchs to a song it is empowering that performer and allowing them to embrace non binary expression."
ainbow,3dtt1n,AdumbroDeus,17,Sun Jul 19 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"No, it works by subverting gender expectations, it is fundamentally an attack on gender norms which is why the trans and drag communities have historically been so closely associated.   They are by their nature punching up."
ainbow,3dtt1n,secretly_an_alpaca,11,Sun Jul 19 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"This.  There are definitely some shitty and transphobic drag queens out there but, historically speaking, the drag and trans communities have been very close and, while I can't speak for everyone, I personally know a lot of trans people who experimented with their presentation by doing drag.  Personally, I do genderfuck drag from time to time as a way of expressing my neutrality since, while I present as a binary trans woman from day to day, the fact of the matter is that I'm not as binary as I tell people I am, but don't have a safe avenue for expressing that outside of drag.  It's totally understandable for people to be uncomfortable with drag shows on a personal level and speaking from their experience, but it becomes a whole different ball game when people try to paint drag as a whole as inherently problematic."
ainbow,3dtt1n,lockedge,3,Sun Jul 19 16:28:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, good drag artists are damned important. However, since RuPaul's Drag Race gained popularity, I've seen the ratios skew way, way towards shitty, transphobic drag in Toronto, Ottawa and Montréal. There's still maybe, like, 15%-20% quality drag happening during shows on average, but there's so much seriously problematic drag happening, queens (and the occasional king) who just don't understand drag's history and purposes, and are just being total shits.   It's just kind of sad, because every year after pride celebrations, it's like there's this 3-ish month period of noticeably increased transphobia where I (and other community members/activists/educators) have to push education and get people to unlearn shit they've come to assume because of shitty drag performances, and that's a whole lot of frustration I wish I wouldn't have to deal with. I get why some might want to push drag performances during pride on the backburner if they don't feel they had a quality drag community around, and if they didn't feel they had the means to re-educate the masses afterward. Trans folk having to teach their friends/family/coworkers/etc. again that calling them a ""tranny"" or ""shemale"" is unacceptable, and that drag queens are not the same as trans women...it's not a fun experience. yet, I have to do this every year, and I know plenty of others in my local community who have to as well, and it's grating, and it can be easy to get mad at the drag community as a whole for spurring on such misconceptions and behaviour, even if that's not entirely fair."

ainbow,3drcni,signal-zero,13,Sat Jul 18 18:40:04 2015 UTC,"I think that's an interesting article, but there are two big things that stick out at me.   Jury Nullifcation is not something which is supposed to happen, and it's not really a valid legal strategy. Talking about it on a jury or during jury selection can get you kicked off the jury:    In 1988, the Sixth Circuit upheld a jury instruction: ""There is no such thing as valid jury nullification."" In 'United States v. Thomas (1997), the Second Circuit ruled that jurors can be removed if there is evidence that they intend to nullify the law. The Supreme Court has not recently confronted the issue of jury nullification. Further, as officers of the court, attorneys have sworn an oath to uphold the law, and are ethically prohibited from directly advocating for jury nullification.      I also would also take issue with this statement. I'm seeing this narrative crop up more and more, and I don't think it jives with reality:    While these issues are deserving of attention, mainstream gay activism is focused on obtaining legal rights that benefit the most privileged members of the LGBT community, such as access to marriage and inclusion in hate crime legislation.   Hate crimes legislation and marriage equality benefit people all across the spectrum of race and economic privelege. In fact, marriage equality benefits people with lower economic standing much more than those with high economic standing. The latter could always afford to go to a lawyer and craft legal documents to try to replicate some of the framework of marriage (joint adoption, rights of inheritance, wills, custody arrangements in case of death, power of attorney, those sorts of documents). While that framework was no substitute for real marriage, it would secure the legal position of couples who could afford to do so. These avenues were not open, though, to those without the money to hire someone to help them create these kinds of legal documents.  Dan Savage had a conversation recently on his podcast about how marriage equality is of immense benefit to people of color, people in unfriendly areas, and people of lower economic standing. You can listen here, and the relevant portion starts around 24 minutes in.  He also addressed this attitude briefly at the beginning of the podcast he recorded after the Surpreme Court ruling came down."
ainbow,3drcni,Dain42,5,Sat Jul 18 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"While talking about can and will get you kicked off, every member of the jury retains the right to vote their conscience. That's why we have juries to begin with, as a check on unjust laws. Otherwise, why bother with a jury?"
ainbow,3drcni,Beigenoise,5,Sat Jul 18 21:33:20 2015 UTC,"To decide if the case, as presented, proves the defendant broke the laws they are alleged to have broken. Morals shouldn't have anything to do with it, hence why the court is within its rights to remove people with conflicts of interest, or people with beliefs that might hinder their ability to make an unbiased judgement."
ainbow,3drcni,Cass_Griffin,3,Sat Jul 18 21:40:44 2015 UTC,Are we then obligated to uphold anti-gay laws if placed on a jury?
ainbow,3drcni,Cass_Griffin,6,Sat Jul 18 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It sounds awful, but you need to realize that historically nullification has been used almost exclusively as a protection for bigots in the court. During Jim Crow, almost every lynching was tried, and the juries decide it wasn't a crime, and passed a not guilty verdict to the judge, and a murderer walked free. Yes, it obligates people to act against their interests in some rare cases, but for the protection of others. It's shitty, and imperfect, but we as individuals can't affect the law in that way. The present alternative is to let anyone with strongly held beliefs hold the court at ransom."
ainbow,3drcni,Cass_Griffin,7,Sat Jul 18 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"So as a group so often marginalized by the majority, how exactly are we to question the legitimacy of laws acting against our basic human rights if we're not allowed such civil disobedience properly understood?"
ainbow,3drcni,FIJANational,6,Sat Jul 18 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"That's a really challenging question, and there isn't a particularly satisfying response. You need to work from outside the court room, and put pressure on law makers to repeal unjust laws, or not make them in the first place. In the mean time, you grow support, spread information on why these laws are discriminatory. Make sure everyone who will listen (and a bunch who won't) hear what you have to say.   Civil disobedience within a jury only further complicates and legitimatizes the already troubled justice system, and creates holes that allow the tyranny of the majority another way to control and damage the minority."
ainbow,3drcni,FIJANational,3,Sat Jul 18 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"Note that during Jim Crow, these acts were committed by all-white juries. As it turns out, there is evidence that demonstrates when even one person of color is on a jury, disparity for conviction rates for blacks vs. whites dramatically decreases.  That said, jury nullification is a tool. Like any other tool, it can be used for good or for evil. The fact that your neighbor decides to use a knife to stab his wife is irrelevant to whether or not you use your knife in the service of feeding your family. Likewise, refusing to use jury nullification to uphold justice does absolutely NOTHING to prevent another person from using it unjustly.  Moreover, refusing to wield jury nullification in defense of peaceful people of color, who are disproportionately convicted and imprisoned, means you are aiding and abetting their removal from jury pools as their civil rights are often lost along with their convictions. That means you are contributing to the very problem of racially non-diverse juries that made possible the Jim Crow verdicts mentioned above.  Kirsten C. Tynan, Fully Informed Jury Association"

Actually, it IS supposed to happen when justice requires it.   Thankfully, jurors have protected freedom of speech, from the William Penn and John Peter Zenger cases to more recent Occupy cases with jury nullification. In dozens of cases jurors nullified the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 by refusing to convict people who helped slaves escape. Jurors have also protected peaceful people who have inadvertently run afoul of the tangled web of weapons laws from being imprisoned for totally victimless offenses. They have time and again nullified unjust drug laws that seek to punish people fighting for their lives with the use of marijuana. And so on.  While prosecutors and judges obviously have a conflict of interest that leads them to discourage jury nullification whenever possible, the facts are that it is not only a valid legal strategy, but it is perfectly legal for jurors to engage in.   Note that while jurors can be removed from a jury for discussing it, they cannot be punished for engaging in it. So... don't talk about it when you're a juror. Problem solved.  Kirsten C. Tynan Fully Informed Jury Association"

Do you specifically spend time searching for that term on reddit, just to pop in as soon as your organization's pet issue is mentioned?  There are unjust laws that do get passed and enforced. And we should work to overturn them. But that's the job of the legislature. And when they don't do it, it's the job of the courts. In a civil society with a trial by jury system, it is the responsibility of jurors to attempt, to the best of their ability, to weigh the case against the laws, not their own moral opinions. Sure that's an unreachable goal, as we all have our personal opinions and biases, however hard we fight against them, but can you imagine the general chaos if every juror were to just disregard that principal and base jury decisions on their specific moral opinions about things rather than the law?  Actually, we don't have to imagine the kind of damage it can do, because as at least one other person in this thread has mentioned, jury nullification swings both ways, and it was a prime tool used to acquit lyncher after lyncher in the South from the Civil War onwards. It became the philosophy of every half-baked racist murderer and KKK member who wanted to get off scott-free — and, of course, of the lawyers and jurors who aided and abetted them."

ainbow,3dq2ak,ihateirony,30,Sat Jul 18 09:48:22 2015 UTC,"--Autogynephilia in women (by Charles Moser, 2009) Moser administered a survey (almost identical to the one Blanchard used) to non-transsexual women and found that: ""By the common definition of ever having erotic arousal to the thought or image of oneself as a woman, 93% of the respondents would be classified as autogynephilic. Using a more rigorous definition of 'frequent' arousal to multiple items, 28% would be classified as autogynephilic.""   So basically this would suggest that a fundamental problem with the notion of autogynephilla is it's lack of understanding of female sexuality in general?

I’m not aware of any effort that was made to link David Geithner’s alleged behavior to his work, or his famous brother, or any public statements he’d made about marriage, or sex, or sexual orientation; to me, any of these would have been have necessary (but not necessarily sufficient) factors in deeming his outing newsworthy. I’m not sure why he should have been outed but his accuser should enjoy anonymity. I’m not sure his accuser is reliable. Without acquiring some certainty on these points, I wouldn’t have published the piece.   His post is worth reading in full, but that bit struck me as worth excerpting."

ainbow,3dkbtu,sirblastalot,8,Fri Jul 17 02:43:03 2015 UTC,Could someone ELI5 the implications of this? What does this mean for employment discrimination nationally? Does this mean no one can be fired for being in the LGBTQ community?
ainbow,3dkbtu,Avalon143,15,Fri Jul 17 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. It is still not illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation in many jurisdictions. However, the courts that would rule on whether or not an employment action is legal or not generally defer to the EEOC's interpretations. Because the EEOC has determined that discriminate based on sexual orientation is inherently discrimination based on sex*, the courts would tend to also agree. Once a court in a jurisdiction has ruled that an employment action taken is discriminatory because of sexual orientation, discrimination based on that is de jure illegal in that jurisdiction.  *The reason it's classified as discrimination based on sex is because a woman would be treated differently than a man for having a female partner. Same action, different genders, different treatment = discrimination based on sex."
ainbow,3dkbtu,MayorBee,5,Fri Jul 17 03:45:12 2015 UTC,Huh. Wow.
ainbow,3dkbtu,jaycatt7,4,Fri Jul 17 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"This ruling puts a ticking timer on ENDA, since this decision by the EEOC will inevitably make its way to the Supreme Court.  The good news is that the Supreme Court grants a lot of deference to the EEOC, so we might actually see Republicans and other conservatives actually push for ENDA.  Why?  Because if SCOTUS rules, there are no religious agency carve-outs that could possibly be written into ENDA."

ainbow,3dkbtu,kellydean1,4,Fri Jul 17 10:16:16 2015 UTC,I still want ENDA to be passed even if it is rendered symbolic by courts and commissions.
ainbow,3dkbtu,fortredr,6,Fri Jul 17 12:22:33 2015 UTC,"The passage of ENDA would not be symbolic; it would actually codify this into law, rather than being something that's potentially dependent upon who's running the EEOC and also dependent upon court rulings upholding the EEOC's determination (they typically do, but there's the possibility that they'd disagree with the EEOC or rule that they exceeded their authority in this determination).  It would take away any wiggle room that remains."
ainbow,3dkbtu,Dain42,2,Fri Jul 17 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is really important, until these protections are written into actual law they will be ignored a lot. It's great to have legal recourse in these situations, but an actual law seems like it will help prevent discrimination before it happens more than this eeoc ruling would."

Finding and connecting with the right people can do wonders for that sense that humanity is a bewildering mass of unpredictable aggression. (I'm still working on that one.)  As for defining yourself... That's up to you to discover. The issues you're talking about seem to be more concerned with how you see yourself than with who you'd like to be with in a romantic or sexual sense. Have you considered the idea that you might be transgender? It's also worth noting that just about every aspect of sexuality and gender is a spectrum (or something more complicated!)--so it's totally OK to be a feminine straight guy, or a person of non-binary gender, or whoever you discover yourself to be.   Good luck to you! (And also: no pressure. You can figure everything on on your own time scale.)"

For example, my sisters wanted me to be sensitive about things and non-violent. My father wanted me to be strong and masculine. My mother wanted me to be attracted to women. I kind of lost what I wanted there. Very soon I'll be on my own and will have total control on my life.

ainbow,3di9sh,ProfSnugglesworth,22,Thu Jul 16 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"I understand the sentiment, but I think that the family made some severely poor choices in their handling of the situation.  The father was approached several times, at the very least by Josh, about the molestation when it first began to occur. They did not take any steps at all at first, and Josh continued to sexually molest young girls. Later, church elders advised that Josh be sent to counseling to local mental health center; his parents declined to follow through with this. When the father did go to the police, he spoke with someone who was a friend of the family's. This officer ignored standard operating procedures and did not follow up on any of the allegations; this officer is now in prison for child pornography. Around this time, the parents sent Josh to work with a family friend for several months. Later, after receiving an anonymous tip, the Oprah Winfrey show reported the Duggars to local state authorities and cancelled an appearance on the show. At this point, the statute of limitations had run out. The parents told authorities that no further incidents had occurred and also lied about the treatment Josh received.   So, charges were never pursued when they should have; the parents allowed the abuse to continue, despite being told by Josh (and possibly his victims) repeatedly over the course of several months; and the parents refused to seek treatment or therapy for either Josh or his victims, and then lied about what had happened for years.  I find it more than a little concerning that the abuse continued for an extended period of time with multiple victims and incidents. However, at least Josh did say something and try to get help. His parents and the police officer, on the other hand, did not act in any of minors' interest, maybe in the short term interests of Josh. I also find it deplorable that the parents and Josh used their celebrity to launch fear campaigns to disparage the LGBT community."

College kids are away from home, away from their family, on their own, and disconnected or at least distanced from their normal support structures in life. Lots of LGBT college kids are just coming out and need somewhere to do that. And plenty of other kids are dealing with all kinds of other issues.  Without the LGBTA Student Resource Center at my campus and the safe space that was my (affirming and accepting Lutheran) campus pastor's office, I'd probably be dead. I hardly think I should need to explain this on an LGBT sub, but you do realize that for lots of people safe spaces are a much-needed respite from the cumulative disapprobation, judgement, shaming, etc. from the rest of the culture, right?  It's not like a ""safe space"" is going to insulate someone completely from the rest of the world or prevent important ideas from being challenged. In fact, the safe space (especially in the case of LGBT people) has itself been a challenge to predominant and harmful ideas and attitudes. It's also not as if there's no debate, discussion, or disagreement in such spaces; that was never my experience. Generally, you just can't be an aggressive jerk towards others, and you're not permitted to use slurs or discriminatory or derogatory language toward others.  The weird obsession that a lot of people on this site seem to have with misrepresenting ""safe spaces"" and decrying their mere existence is mystifying to me on any other sub, let alone one like this."

ainbow,3dklxk,shakedogshake,2,Fri Jul 17 17:19:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen that Times op-ed. But that's not what's traditionally meant by ""safe space"" as used by most rational people. That also goes beyond the typical idea of a safe space on a campus to trying to extend the safe space to be the entire campus.   I don't think it's the edge cases like the ones highlighted in that article that should be the main focus when ""safe spaces"" are discussed, much like gay people would not want people to act as if Larry Craig, Ted Haggard, and George Rekkers were representative of our community. But people seem to want to focus on these outrageous examples as if they're typical of what people mean by ""safe space"", probably becuase they're eye-catching. As one of the articles I link below puts it, they're truthy more than true.  The McElroy person mentioned in that article would almost certainly not be an appropriate guest in a ""safe space"" for rape survivors, for example, but having a discussion on a campus is a reasonable thing to do, as long as she doesn't invoke any outrageous invective and isn't known for doing so. Which the author implies she's not.  There have also been some superb editorials countering this currently prevalent meme that ""ultra-sensitive college kids are destroying free thought"". Most of them centered around the fact that this kind of attitude is extremely limited and fairly uncommon:   I was a liberal adjunct professor. My liberal students didn’t scare me at all. (Which was a response to this op-ed.) The truth about ""political correctness"" is that it doesn't actually exist - Which is not directly about college students, but more about the current panic over ""political correctness gone mad""."
ainbow,3dklxk,Dain42,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna destroy this argument here and now k? Ok.   College kids are having issue from being away from home.  Isn't that what they made community colleges or home campuses by their homes for? To actually not travel to god knows where?  LGBTA student resource center actually helps people. By basically seperating them from the real world in reality.  I'm sorry to say this but if you need a safe space from society's constant views of objection and harmful ideas as you just mentioned. Then you shouldn't be going to college, you shouldn't expand your horizon if you can't even take a insult about your sexuality. Now if its harassment to god knows how long to the point of depression, that's understandable.  Safe spaces don't insulate someone from the rest of the world.  Yeah they kinda do. A lot of times, safe spaces actually in multiple colleges and clubs have shown to be racial at the very least. May I please remind us about the so called ""Blacks safe-spaces""? Or are we just going to forget about that? IF there is no bad things like debate or discussion then its going to be okay!  No it will not. Discussion, debate, and disagreement is human nature, no one is not going to just agree on thing of another. If that is true then what's the point of living? what's the point of even having human contact or interaction? You might as well put a Virtual Reality helmet on and just don't talk to anyone and everything can be just a grey space with learning for the rest of your life.   People misrepresents ""safe spaces""  Because people who represent ""safe spaces"" continue to act like children and just run into their rooms or in their closet when something that actually is reality happens. There's not going to be a safe space in your job, your bills, or anything. So why even make a safe space if the rest of the world who has to endure the bullshit?"

ainbow,3dl1hw,maybeafetish97654345,10,Fri Jul 17 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"You're right none of us will know how she will react. I know I'm different because I like to have fun with people's fetishes. Like, if you told me that I would use it to have fun with you, if you felt comfortable with it. I would so use that while talking dirty. That's me though. One vote for it could go well.  There is something though that I would be remiss if I didn't mention, and that is that trans people often have trouble with people that get affectionately referred to as ""chasers"". People that only want trans people for their trans-ness. I know that isn't what you are doing, but it could be construed that way. Add to that, some trans people feel repulsed by their own equipment, and may not even use them during sexual activities. Also it could be really disheartening to find out someone doesn't see you as the gender you are.  I feel though that you have a chance here to make it work out, if she's ok with it. If you feel the need to discuss this with her I would try and stress that you are turned on by uniqueness, you appreciate the differences in people and the experiences they bring, and that you like to celebrate that in your partners. You could then go and express what you mean by that. Maybe using examples even. I would also express how you see her as a woman through and through. She may have different experiences that she brings to the table and that's important to you. Lastly it may be a chance to steer the conversation into what you both like sexually, including fetishes. I find it important to be able to talk about things openly and directly, but it can be difficult at times. I have found it is always worth it in the end.  I hope that this helps and if you have any questions, ask away."

Many cisgendered people feel the same way, though I'm sure not as badly. I've dealt with it in previous partners, so I hope eventually those experience will help us to show her she's beautiful. Obviously it'll take some doing, but nobody should have to feel repulsed by themselves.     Also it could be really disheartening to find out someone doesn't see you as the gender you are.   That was my primary concern. Good to see I've understood correctly how she's likely feeling.    I do still see her as a woman, I think. Just a very special one.

You developed feelings for her before you knew she is trans, not because she is trans. I know I worry if my partners see me as a woman, but they never misgender me, and always support me through my transition. This could be a great experience to see how you feel about gender and gender identity. I've found being mindful always helps."

After years of hearing (from both sides) that my sexuality was either wrong or nonexistent, it felt pretty damn good to hear somebody call it hot. To not be just accepted for who I am, but actually desired because of it!  Like I said, her experience may be very different, but my guess is she'll take it better than you expect. Just make sure she understands that you also desire her as a person, and that her being trans is just icing on the cake."
ainbow,3dl1hw,lbeaty1981,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering! This is the scenario I'm hoping for when I bring it up. Fingers crossed.
ainbow,3dl1hw,maybeafetish976543v2,3,Sat Jul 18 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly? If someone who I'd expressed mutual interest in laid their feelings out like the above?  I'd probably come to the conclusion that you don't see me as a real girl. That you see me as some unreal, fantasy/sci-fi trait-owning thing. And maybe there'd still be some residual feelings that you felt I was a girl lingering around, but they'd dissipate, or at least certainly wouldn't win over or be prioritized over your fetish. tl;dr, I'd feel like you saw me as a living breathing sex toy. Perhaps not entirely as such, but first and foremost, and that'd unnerve me and disappoint me enough to keep my distance from you   But that's just me. I've been burned by chasers before, and I know a number of other trans girls who have been absolutely abused by them, so my gut reaction towards anyone being attracted to me over physical aspects of my 'trans-ness' is to get the hell out of dodge and avoid them like the plague. I only personally know one trans woman dating a fetishist(who is also outright denied acting on his fetish by her), and that takes a lot of communication and a lot of effort to make it work.   Past that, in a more general sense, I think it's important that if you wish to date this woman, that you approach the situation fairly. Don't put your sexual interests before her. Ask about how she feels about transitioning, what her goals are, how she feels about her body. If she mentions having dysphoria over her genitals, then that's a big sign that if you were to have sex, you should assume that you won't be touching that, and if that's a deal breaker for you, that's a deal breaker. Traditional chaser behaviour, at least one aspect of it, is to lure in trans women and disregard their dysphoria, their future plans...it's typical for a chaser to try and make genital-dysphoric trans women like their genitals through sexual intercourse so that they can maintain access to it and keep fulfilling their fetish, as if we can just get rid of dysphoria with positive thinking and self-love. It doesn't work like that. So if she's dysphoric over her genitals, you should assume she does not want to be touched there or have those genitals used in sex, unless explicitly told otherwise. A good many dysphoric trans women will be fine to use strap-ons...that tends to be unsatisfying for those with particular fetishes, but if she's not comfortable with her genitals, that could be an option.  And if you two do keep dating, and the above comes to light (her not being comfortable using what she has, and potentially not being able to fulfill your fetish), and you start feeling bitter or entitled over her bodily decisions...quit out and break up before anyone does something they'll regret."

Good to learn it's not all in my head.    edit- and no, we haven't spoken about her dysphoria. She seems to want our conversations to stay light for a while. As to my reaction, I want her to feel good about herself. I'm glad you brought this up, because honestly I probably would have tried that ""positive thinking and self-love"" thing. I dated a very Christian girl who thought her vagina was dirty and sinful, and getting her through that made her so happy and confident. So you've helped me dodge a bullet there."

From what you wrote I would lean toward the former.  Once you have been together a while and she knows you honestly, actually, like her and her body, maybe confess that her being trans was actually a draw for you.  She's almost certainly kept important things to herself, she'll understand that you didn't burst out with it right after her tears stopped.  When you finally do tell her, let her know straight out that you didn't say so because you were worried about what she would think.

Trans as a movement is rather centric, seemingly emphasizing the idea that self-definition is an inalienable right, yet keeping that lens focused on the gender/sex conversation. Gender/sex self-definition - a-OK. Racial/cultural self-definition? Absolutely wrong.     Rachel Dolezal bullshit.     If I resolved my massive self-image issues with surgery, there would be an uncomfortable notion among those I knew that I was running away from my real self. But if that self-image issue were a gender thing, suddenly it might be justifiable.     This is just a misunderstanding of trans people as ""running away from [their real selves]"" as opposed to towards them.    ""But David!"" I hear you cry, shocked that you know my name. ""They admit they might be wrong and are attempting to educate themselves!"" But is that what bestof is about?

We give others a temporary chance to come around, but we ultimately choose to be happy and kick those who bring us down for who we are out of our lives- even if they are family. You don't deserve to feel guilty or anxious for the rest of your life, and people do not deserve the chance to inflict those feelings on you.  You don't have to do anything. Especially if you're not in a position to financially support yourself and think your parents might cut you off. You don't have to come out to your coworkers if you're worried it will result badly. But being in the closet is a huuuuuge weight on your shoulders and you don't realize you have until it's gone. The answer may not be to come out now. But it should be a goal, eventually. The people who attach stigma to being lgbt are not worth having in your life. You leave them behind-that's how we deal. Some people may surprise you, in both good and bad ways.  It's can be difficult. But people's biggest fear-losing friends and family- usually turns out to be a blessing in disguise. It sucks. People take years to rebuild a loving community. But when they looked back, they often wonder why they were so hellbent on keeping people in their life whose biggest role was to cause stress, anxiety, or guilt. It's not an easy path, but the alternative would be, what, waiting until your parents die in your 50's or 60's and going ""whelp, finally free! Now I can finally live the life I want!"""

One simple example of this is about 10 years ago a lesbian friend of mine had her car stolen, vandalized and left somewhere, now I see at least a few HRC equal sign stickers in every reasonably sized parking lot I go to. People at least in the more developed areas are no longer terrified to be open about who they are. I see people who were entirely conservative and extremely religious when we were younger posting so much gay positive news on facebook and people who made fun of anything they saw as gay at all who are now staunch allies. Change is slow, but it's mostly the rural areas and the boomers holding our state back. The young people are ready for change and are largely supportive of LGBT people. There's also predictions based on demographic changes saying that Texas will most likely become a swing state within about a decade.  I'm not defending Texas's policies nor am I defending the large amount of pseudo-religious bigots here. I'm not saying it's perfect and honestly I plan to leave the state when I'm in a better position to do, but Texas isn't a lost cause. Almost all the major cities and some areas including, Austin, Dallas and Dallas County, Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, Waco, Brownsville, and even El Paso have LGBT discrimination ordinances. Texas is not the completely backwards place that somewhere like Mississippi or Alabama is, we've got a long way to go, but it's slowly moving in the right direction. There's so many people here that disagree with our state government and the religious right, it just pisses me off to hear people talk about Texas like it's some hopeless hellhole and write off everyone here.

ainbow,3dfgys,NGeX,4,Thu Jul 16 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, and no. The US Constitution most certainly does apply in terms of the provisions of Article IV, Section 3 (the bit giving Congress power over the territories); and the Supreme Court has ruled (in a series of cases called the Insular Cases) that ""fundamental rights"" apply to American Samoa:   The question whether particular rights are fundamental has been answered only as specific cases come before the Supreme Court. The Court has identified the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination as a fundamental right. On the other hand, the Court has said that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury and the Fifth Amendment right to indictment by a grand jury “are not fundamental in their nature, but concern merely a method of procedure . . . .” (source:PDF)   So, pretty much; a case has to come up before the Supreme Court to get them to determine if the basis of the Marriage ruling is ""fundamental"" in nature and thus applies to American Samoa.   In the same-sex marriage decision, the majority opinion of the court said:   Over time and in other contexts, the Court has reiterated that the right to marry is fundamental under the Due Process Clause (p.11 of the opinion, p.16 of the PDF)    and the language continues like this -     The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry (p.22 of the opinion, p.27 of the PDF)   Given that, I'd say that the Supreme Court will rule that, as they've already found marriage to be a fundamental right, it applies to the territories of the US in full, including in American Samoa.  I'm not a lawyer though (or a yank either), so take what I've said here with appropriate caution."

Sports teams? You need peers you can talk to about this stuff. It sounds like you have family - if they're supportive of you, tell them what's happening. If I ever told my mother someone was bullying me she would jump up to act so fast my head would spin. I was depressed as hell in the small town where I was from and she personally paid for me to move to a big city where I could pursue my dreams and also have a ton of other gay people around.  Lastly, find a gay-friendly therapist. You need to deal with your depression and anxiety. Happy people who we well-adjusted do not think about off-ing themselves, especially over what people say. I've been bullied in my life. I've been suicidal before. I cannot express to you how much having an individual therapist helped me to find my inner confidence, my inner ""no,"" my inner strength, etc. I would not be where I am today without therapy.  You also sound like you don't live in a very ""open"" area. I always tell my friends it's a good idea to move to a gay friendly city. I moved from middle of nowhere Ohio to Los Angeles for this reason. I can walk down the street holding my fiance's hand without anyone saying a damn thing.  Good luck. Keep your head up. ""Water off a duck's back."" Don't give up your power to other people, especially losers. LOVE YOURSELF (PLEASE). Seek support. Find a therapist. That's all I'll leave you with."

I got on the bus and it was packed so I went upstairs where a bunch of roudy kids were sitting, they shouted ""pedo!"" a lot so I thought ""fuck that I'll just stand downstairs"". It was just like that scene off peep show, except actually on the bus with a full audience. I had to laugh because I was 17 at the time and had been into older guys as long as I could remember anyway. They eventually got kicked off, but these things happen. Kids are stupid, they often grow up to regret their behaviour  Since then I've had stuff thrown at me like beer cans and even a bell pepper, people have occassionally made some disparaging remarks, but nothing too serious. My ex was not so lucky and got kicked right in the face outside a gay bar, this is in the UK btw. He was afraid to leave the house for a while but I made sure to show him it's a once in a lifetime event and we went out like usual, and I don't think he's had any trouble since. It happens but its just something you have to learn to brush off and not let it get you down.   I haven't had any trouble in a few years, and ireland just voted to legalise gay marriage, so you know the majority is on your side and people do care about you. I like to watch documentaries or a film when stuff like that happens to cheer mysef up a bit   As for the lady, did she actually think you were a peadophile or was it because you were gay/bi?"

You don't realize it, but I think you're having a panic attack.  It's not your fault that you suffer from depression and anxiety.

That said, it is worth it, and you will almost certainty see positive results in the long term; please seek out some help.    People with depression, anxiety, and even schizophrenia can bounce up from their low points and reach great heights when given proper care.  In the long term you will not regret it.  You're not the exception for which there really is no hope.  That's your depression talking.  Treatment isn't going to ruin your life.

There are other AIDS-related restrictions, like women who had sex with actively bisexual men and iv drug users, but nobody else got a lifetime ban, and they still collect blood donations in communities with higher-than-average infection rates.  Ultimately, all donated blood is tested, and without such vigorous screening against other risk factors (like iv drug use, etc) it doesn't really make sense, but the people in favor of it are so into their personal ick factor about teh gayz that it's stuck around a lot longer than really makes sense."

ainbow,3ddbor,lightningbender,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:08:51 2015 UTC,"So, your first mistake is referring to gay rights. There is no such thing as the right to donate blood, not for anyone of any sexual orientation. Blood donation is considered a privilege, one that can and has been revoked for many reasons, including as you mentioned MSM, but also for living in certain countries for certain amounts of time. You are absolutely correct that HIV is not a gay disease, but you also don't get diseases by living in England in the 80s (specifically Mad Cow), but both of those can cause that privilege to be revoked. Nearly all medical decisions are a question of risks and benefits - we don't care about being inclusive or politically correct, all we care about is minimizing risk to the patient. Are we perhaps more aggressive in minimizing the risk than we have to be? Yes. There was in the past a huge outbreak or Hepatitis C and HIV in patients that required many transfusions, as a result of which to protect the integrity of the blood supply the decision was made that it would be better to turn away a large number of donors if it meant reducing the chance of causing the disease. These decisions are purely based on statistics, and as u/skylerdray pointed out in this link, according to reliable resources the incidence of HIV in the MSM population is higher than other groups. It's simple math, we'd rather exclude whatever percent of the population is necessary if it means preventing even one case of transfusion associated HIV, though with changing incidences of HIV over time, hopefully rules like this will become unnecessary soon.

This is why Amazon never charged sales tax upon checkout in Ohio because they never performed business in the state. Now that they have a business here, they're required to charge it at time of checkout.  From what it sounds like, she has a really solid case: ""Last year, Cote filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a prerequisite to filing an employment discrimination lawsuit. The commission said in January that Wal-Mart violated gender discrimination laws by denying benefits to Smithson.""

ainbow,3da4f0,nightpanda893,13,Tue Jul 14 23:28:05 2015 UTC,"By posting that thread you implied the generalization that our community is not welcoming of Christian lgbt individuals, which is just as much a half-truth and is equally as insulting as making the claim all Christians are homophobes.  Your message was interpreted as a stratified extreme of itself because that's how communicating on the internet works, but I think it got so heated because you were accusing our community of something that I (and probably many others) don't think is necessarily true."
ainbow,3da4f0,thethundering,0,Wed Jul 15 00:27:25 2015 UTC,I can see that and if someone would have said something like that in a response I would have discussed it. Although I could have missed it too.
ainbow,3da4f0,nightpanda893,9,Wed Jul 15 00:41:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, come on.  You're being really disingenuous here.  If you go back to your thread I made several posts that were as positive and supportive of gay Christians as humanly possible, considering I'm one of many millions of gay people who have had a horrible experience with religion, particularly Catholicism.  In one post I was thinking out loud, wondering - if there are gay supportive churches and subs like /r/openchristian then is there even really a problem?  In response, you accused me of sounding just ""..like any other homophobe trying to rationalize their attitudes.""  WTF?  I guess what I'm saying is that I agree with thethundering.  Your motives were good, but the premise of the thread was flawed.  You weren't looking for discussion.  Only agreement.  And, on top of that, I get the overall impression that too many gay people of faith only want the rest of us to heal according to their schedule... their rules... particularly if it somehow leads back to Christianity or some other faith.  It doesn't work that way."
ainbow,3da4f0,Selris,-6,Wed Jul 15 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"The reason I responded like that was because it was very reminiscent of the whole ""they can be gay just don't be gay around me attitude."" Or the idea that people you don't like should just stay separate."
ainbow,3da4f0,nightpanda893,0,Wed Jul 15 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"The thread was in response to a thread where posts hostile to acceptance of pro-gay LGBT Christians are heavily up voted.  The community, not the linked poster, is the one creating these generalizations.  People were basically saying that even pro-gay Christians should be harrassed because of the supposed inconsistency of their beliefs when they come to LGBT organizations and communities for support."
ainbow,3da4f0,shaedofblue,5,Wed Jul 15 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"Which means about as much as someone condescendingly approaching a very large, very diverse group of Christians with the premise that Christians as a whole are anti-LGBT because some of them said they don't accept LGBT Christians.  If our community is responsible for our generalizations, and that an acceptable response to that is to take them at face value and chastise us for them, then people can't get upset when some of us chastise the entire Christian community for generalizations that they are apparently now responsible for."
ainbow,3da4f0,thethundering,11,Wed Jul 15 15:57:29 2015 UTC,"I get that, but I feel like a lot of this reaction is like the boy who cried wolf. christians have been using the same sort of appeals, but acting in bad faith; trying to silence criticism rather than work toward mutual respect and understanding. now people don't want to hear it, regardless of sincerity."

It is a hateful religion that teaches that all people are deserving of eternal punishment. Combine that with the fact that people don't actually change their beliefs or actions based on what's in the book but vice versa - you don't see any Christians defending slavery or keeping Kosher - and it's pretty easy to have no desire to be around it. Particularly when the only reason heterosexism is so widespread is because of Abrahamic religions in general."
ainbow,3da4f0,waldrop02,6,Wed Jul 15 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"It is a hateful religion that teaches that all people are deserving of eternal punishment.   It is essentially a death cult, which glorifies death and dying with promises of reward after death.  The heroes of the myth structure are frequently commanded to actions of incredible violence and destruction by the god figure, justified as righteous retribution against people who've either spurned the ""love"" of the god, or who have ancestors who insulted the ancestors of the faithful.  It teaches that everyone is irredeemably sick, but that's okay because there's a loophole that lets you in to the Cool People's Club after death despite the fact that you really deserve eternal torment, as long as you profess belief and believe in nonsense without question.  There's a reason why religion is so easily used to support violence, hatred and destruction.  But these facts don't mean that everyone who believes necessarily accepts that - many people don't think about it, or - either consciously or unconsciously - ignore the more horrible bits.  Most people who follow any given religion are decent people who want the same things that everybody wants - peace, security, prosperity.  They've just, for one reason or another, bought into something irrational."

Need proof of their sincerity?  Look at what spectacular allies they are! - all the times they posted something on Reddit beginning with ""I think that gay people should be allowed to marry, but...""  I'd pay them no mind but unfortunately those types seem to be the vast majority (based on upvotes/downvotes and comments) on sites I frequent like Reddit or Hacker News.  Really fed up also with the people with victim complexes who post ""Hey guys, GUYS, #notallchristians ZOMG!"" and then claim they're being ""persecuted"" when the replies are merely mostly rather than entirely supportive, and immediately run off to complain to group #1 and all together circlejerk on the karma train til the Lord's kingdom come in a boxcar full of splooge."

I compared /r/atheism and /r/christian side by side as to what they have to say about the LGBT community. The first is mostly outrage about how bad we are treated and victory threads about advancements the second is fairly silent about us except the occasional thread about whether or not its ""okay to be gay as long as you don't have sex"" or how ""we are all sinners.""   I see no problems with that thread and think it is just fairly normal discussion. As Winston Churchill once said, ""You have enemies? Good.

And frustrating in that people seemed to respond without even reading the post (ie responding with ""why should we respect people that hate us"" type comments when the title itself clearly said I was referring to respecting accepting denominations and actual LGBT people). But I don't know if more moderation is necessarily the answer. It's hard when I think of the LGBT Christians out there who see their own community as rejecting them but at the same time I think all that more moderation will do is back people into a corner more. I really don't know. And even if we got stricter it's hard to determine what gets removed and what doesn't.   I just think it's something that needs to continue to be thoughtfully discussed. And just hope that people remember that these are real people they are talking to. There is someone on the other side taking of all the anger you are throwing down and many of them are LGBT people themselves who have already been dealing with that shit their entire lives.

But I think another part of it is that one of the tenets of capital-A-Atheism is that it requires evangelism; to quote Wikipedia, it's a view that “religion should not simply be tolerated but should be countered, criticized, and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises.”   For some people in that thread, I think that any person arguing in defense of faith simply must be countered; it's the only way to lift the curse of religion from society. Which is probably fine in /r/changemyview, but is likely to become pretty tiresome in /r/ainbow, especially if you're a queer person of faith who probably didn't come here for this."

And why should anyone care any more about how tiresome talking about LGBT atheism is than you care about how tiresome I find people talking about #NotAllChristians is?  In fact, why don't we just shut down this subreddit so that nobody ever has to read anything they find tiresome ever again?    Honestly, how entitled do you have to be to complain that people are expressing a different opinion than you?  Read it, downvote if it makes you feel better, and move on with your life.

We're a community dedicated to supporting LGBT folks of all stripes. We're not a community dedicated to advancing the spread of atheism. We want all viewpoints, but when it comes to telling people what they should believe, I kind of wish Atheists would take a more live-and-let-live approach — especially in the case of LGBT people of faith who belong to accepting denominations.   As a side note, and so you know where my biases are: I'm agnostic, which means I'm not sure about any of it.

You got me, having to hear that someone thinks your beliefs are bad is definitely the worst thing that has ever happened to anyone in the world ever, throughout human history.  And it's terrible how it's so widespread that most LGBT people aren't even atheists!  And what's worse is that you're forced at gunpoint by the government to read all of these horrible, psyche-destroying words!  Oh wait, we're not children and have to learn to deal with other people in the world who have different beliefs.  Part of that means knowing when to ignore people who bother you, especially when it's as easy as just clicking ""ignore"" in RES or minimizing their comment box.   I kind of wish Atheists would take a more live-and-let-live approach — especially in the case of LGBT people of faith who belong to accepting denominations.    What an absolute load of horse shit.  Atheists aren't trying to write atheism into laws, force it to be taught in schools, or otherwise make life miserable for the vast majority of Christian Americans.  As for ubiquity, take a drive down any major highway for a few hours and let me know if you see more Christian messages or atheist messages.

Of course, some Christians can't help but evangelize no matter where they go, and of course I dislike that. I wish they'd also take a live-and-let-live approach. But I'm not in charge of the Sunday morning programming in Midland, I'm just a guy trying to ask people to be nice on the Internet.

And if they are driven out, who cares?  There are places specifically for LGBT Christians and Christian allies elsewhere on Reddit where they can discuss whatever they want, free of the specter of disagreement.  You also seem intent on conflating being nice with completely and utterly agreeing with someone else.  If you see people calling someone a shithead just because they're a Christian, or calling all Christians shitheads, then you might have a point, but I think that is extremely rare.  As for general pleasantness of conversation with people I disagree with, I'm so over it most of the time.

There are plenty of things I like that aren't popular in the LGBT community either but I don't act like I'm oppressed for it. These threads always have claims that the LGBT community is ~just as bad~ as homophobes for not wanting Christian messages in our spaces which is really some of the most obvious homophobic BS, yet somehow people here buy this."
ainbow,3d5wtq,helpmeredditimbored,32,Mon Jul 13 19:47:55 2015 UTC,So what about transgender scouts? I am an eagle scout. What does that mean for me if I wanted to become an asst scout master and what not to give back.
ainbow,3d5wtq,Wannabkate,6,Tue Jul 14 00:02:32 2015 UTC,Nothing yet. Maybe be a girl scout leader? :D
ainbow,3d5wtq,redsectoreh,17,Tue Jul 14 00:11:50 2015 UTC,They dont do nearly as much high adventure as I would like. but the cookies are a nice bonus.
ainbow,3d5wtq,Wannabkate,5,Tue Jul 14 00:14:42 2015 UTC,"It's not Boy Scouts, but in a high adventure Explorer post a town over from me growing up, I found a much more relaxed attitude, less strict adherence to convention, vastly more activity and actual doing things. If your intention is to give back, that organization might be a better avenue and out of the current spotlight. They were much more accepting of me than the local Boy Scouts were by far. Writing this, I'm realizing just how much it affected my life for the better. High angle rescue, woodland and architectural fire fighting, (been a while, not sure if these are the right terms any more but we put on respirators and crawled through burning training buildings, trained on woodland fire fighting tanks, learned to fight fires with rakes and shovels) caving, mountaineering, hiking, first aid volunteering at public events, even some civil engineering in the form of maintaining trails, roads, and river banks in parks and so on. We did things, constantly. In comparison to what was available to me in Boy Scouts, at least locally, our activities far outstripped what the Boy Scouts did. I think this to be a localized thing to my area, but if it wasn't for Explorers, my childhood would have blown a lot worse than it already did. Boy Scouts to my experience was an extension of the same crap I got at school: bullies, comically and childishly biased authority figures, and the same pecking order games. The local Boy Scouts in town would go camping once or twice a year. We were in the woods at least twice a month and met once a week. Again, I think it may have been a local phenomenon but, it was my salvation as a rejected and ""different"" kid and I always remember the difference in acceptance and treatment."
ainbow,3d5wtq,danielsevelt007,3,Tue Jul 14 02:32:54 2015 UTC,My bsa troop we were in the woods and going high adventure stuff at least twice a month too. So my troop was probably more like you're explores.
ainbow,3d5wtq,Wannabkate,3,Tue Jul 14 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"Lots of girl scout troops do the same thing as boy scouts. Of course, I didn't learn thus until I was too old. I always thought boy scouts were cooler."
ainbow,3d5wtq,Thin-White-Duke,2,Tue Jul 14 08:55:52 2015 UTC,I don't know about that my scout experience was pretty high adventure. We camped a lot with backpacking often. As well as a bunch of other things. So maybe my troop wasn't the typical one. Let me put it this way. There is a patch for over 100 nights camping. I have that one. I have camped for over a 1/3 of a year.
ainbow,3d5wtq,Wannabkate,2,Tue Jul 14 09:02:37 2015 UTC,"Like you said, it depends on your troop. Your experience isn't the typical one, but there are girl scout troops that do a lot of adventuring."
ainbow,3d5wtq,Thin-White-Duke,2,Tue Jul 14 09:04:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know anything about either scout group... But if you did join up with the Girl Scouts, couldn't you MAKE them have the high adventure you're hoping for? Plenty of young girls are looking for the same thing you want. Just about every girl I know has said ""I never joined Girl Scouts because I wanted to do what the Boy Scouts were doing and didn't have the option."" Seems like someone should make the option?"

I am a 90s kid, cynical and pessimistic because of the reality that i saw when the internet, cell phones, and 9/11 changed America (and of course the world but i am focusing on american attitudes and reactions).  Instead of leaving any money and energy left to continue the progressive direction we were moving in, Bush took us way back in time and practically erased what cultural breakthroughs we had just barely made near the turn of the century.    WE ALL need another Revolution, A LA 1960s...we're still fighting race, maraijuana, and sexual freedom.  Problem is the kids of today and the parents of today have become way too complacent and don't believe they can do anything about it because their supposed saviors had failed.  the war mongers cant be having all this domestic victory because that would mean we're actually building up society instead of being afraid of that which we cannot control, and they thier giant penis of an ego won't be needed."
ainbow,3d5wtq,mistressiris,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:43:44 2015 UTC,"I think the fear was that the resolution during that time (only allowing gay and bi youth, not leaders) was not going to pass, let alone one that included leaders. Many of the people on the board (i.e. AT&T executive) are pro LGBT, but feared even such a conservative resolution would be shot down.  Instead it passed with 55% in 2013, which was remarkable in my eyes, because I know how much the Mormon Church has a hold on the BSA  This newest resolution is the next step, but not perfect. It still allows troop discrimination. Why? Charters. Most charters are churches, and many of them are strongly anti lgbt. So if they were to put in a full, non-opt out, non discrimination clause, they would lose the majority of their charters and probably crumble.  It bothers me greatly, but at least with this step, gay leaders and youth can leave discriminatory troops and potentially start or find new ones.   The next step is changing the mentality within religion."

They would lose probably half of chartering organizations overnight with non-opt out inclusion.   It bothers me greatly, but I see why it happened.

It just seems fluffy and saccharine to me. It conveniently ignores centuries of doctrine-justified bigotry.  This is an extremely new, extremely oversimplified and inaccurate way of looking at Christianity as it has been practiced for 2000 years.   I of course prefer it to blatant homophobia -does it even need to be said?- but ultimately, it's still cherry-picking the parts you like out of the Bible and choosing to worship from that perspective. Why would you want to worship with the Bible at all? You have to sift through a large festering pile of homophobia, misogyny, and violence to find the little diamonds of love and acceptance.

I'm oversimplifying it for the sake of brevity, but if one verse in the Bible says, ""God loves you"", and another says, ""Homosexual acts are an abomination deserving of death"", why would I trust that book as a consistent moral authority?  And even if there is some modern interpretation along the lines of, ""No, it wasn't the homosexuality being condemned, it was the lust,"" or some such, why would I trust a book whose message is open to thousands of different types of interpretation, most of which have been used to unjustly discriminate? Why wouldn't God have given us a clearer rule book?"
ainbow,3d5vrc,nsdwight,-3,Mon Jul 13 21:03:56 2015 UTC,"I can clear a few things up.    The church isn't perfect, including its interpretation of the bible. To say that the bible or the church are perfect is to say that they are God, which is idolatry. Progress is a good thing to us, it makes us more like Christ.  The interpretation to spite homosexuality is very modern. Homosexuality hadn't been properly studied or understood until recently so the bible condemns a very different thing than homosexuality. Harmful promiscuity and sacred sex/ temple prostitution are what the verses are actually about, twisted to fit societies anti-lgbt leanings.

And hypothetically speaking, even if your point is true, we've just been misinterpeting for so long, and we're finally getting it right, it still doesn't answer why if god is omniscient, why didn't he foresee this clusterf*** and give us a clear, consistent rulebook?"

Just because you're not specifically focusing on homosexuality doesn't make Matthew 3:12 any more pleasant for those of us who your prophet decides is 'chaff' and summarily tortures."

The more I look into it, the clearer the original church's position is. We can just get around this by saying maybe people got it all wrong, but that takes a lot of the authority out of the religion.    Here are some very early writings on homosexuality in Catholicism. http://www.catholic.com/tracts/early-teachings-on-homosexuality  """"[T]urn your looks to the abominations, not less to be deplored, of another kind of spectacle. . . . Men are emasculated, and all the pride and vigor of their sex is effeminated in the disgrace of their enervated body; and he is more pleasing there who has most completely broken down the man into the woman. He grows into praise by virtue of his crime; and the more he is degraded, the more skillful he is considered to be. Such a one is looked upon—oh shame!—and looked upon with pleasure. . . .""

Society is changing and homophobia is becoming less acceptable Christianity is homophobic because the Bible says various bad things about homosexuality This is bad because Biblical homophobia will eventually start scaring churchgoers away and turning people off from Christianity in general. Oh look, it turns out that when the Bible says this bad thing about homosexuality, it actually means something totally different! (every argument for LGBT-affirming Christianity basically boils down to this) If that's what the author really meant, why doesn't the text just say that instead? Shut up, lol! Please come back to church.  We didn't really mean everything we said about LGBT people for the last 2,000 years. Look, we even hung up a rainbow flag outside.  Please like us. ???????

The Bible was essentially compiled only once by the Nicaean council in AD 325 and has retained its source material for that whole time. Translation errors can be argued to be divine in nature as they still come from ""holy"" source material.

Is there a way to support LGBT Christians without supporting Christianity?  Without succumbing to the ""Pope Francis is the Single Greatest Person Ever"" bandwagon?  Without particularly wanting to hear about the nifty Episcopal church who marched in the last pride parade?  If so, I'll do it.  Genuinely - I want the best for our community.  But I do resent Christianity and the damage it's done to my friends and family.  I have no interest in exploring gay-friendly versions of a faith that was hostile to gays for 2000 years.  Remember that the Theodosian code was the first instance of religiously-backed anti-gay legislation.  Nothing much has changed since.  In the other thread I suggested what I really think is the only possible alternative - Christians have to stop indoctrinating children.  If an adult gay man or woman decides that Christianity is, indeed, THE WAY, and they should remain celibate, fine. Still, it's a choice that has to be made without coercion.  I would've liked the opportunity to make such a choice.  Who knows?  If I'd been given the chance I might be a gay Christian right now."

ainbow,3d5vrc,leviathanxs,13,Tue Jul 14 01:31:34 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  That's one hell of an ""if"" though.    The problem is that the nature of Christianity makes it really hard for it to avoid hurting people.  Basically, it inserts a whole bunch of flawed assumptions into believers's minds that skew their moral reasoning, so it's easy for them to think that they're helping someone when they're really hurting them.    Torturing heretics and non-believers is a great historical example of this.  Obviously torturing people isn't nice, and most of us are usually nice people who wouldn't condone that or go around doing it. But if you're a Christian who believes that a Jew or a Muslim or a heretic is going to hell and get tortured forever, the idea of torturing them until they convert seems better than the alternative.  Harm becomes help.    The same idea is at work every time some Christian couple sends an LGBT teenager off to one of their reeducation camps.  Every time we talk about this on here, people always go after the fucking parents.  I'm going to take an unpopular stand and I say I don't hate parents who do shit like this (don't kill me, let me finish).  They think they're doing the best thing possible for their children.  They're saving them from a lake of fire.  A few months of beatings and some shock therapy is nothing compared to having your testicles ripped off over and over again for all eternity by an ""all-loving"" God.  Again, harm becomes help.  It's not the parents, it's the fucked up religion they follow and the people who spread it that are to blame.   Save your hate for them.    Yeah, I know.  LGBT-affirming Christianity removes the assumption about gay people getting tossed into hell, so it's all OK now?  Well, it's not.  You can alter the religion to accept gay people, but the moral mechanism that turns harm into help is still intact.  Unless you completely strip down and rebuild the religion, removing hell and turning God into this vague fluffy ball of happiness, which you can totally do, but why even bother calling it Christianity at that point?  Here's another example: If you still believe in Hell, you can reasonably make the argument that going around and killing loudmouth atheists is morally justified.  Take me for example.  I've personally talked at least one or two people out of following Christianity, and if it turns out that I'm wrong, they're all going stright to Hell with me.  When you consider what that really means (i.e. getting molten salt poured on your skin 10 billion times), it makes me worse than Hitler to the power of Pol Pot (from the Christian perspective of course, so it's a good thing they're completely full of shit).  So as far as traditional Christians are concerned, it probably would have been better if someone offed me the second I spoke up about not believing in God.  And spare me the line about ""thou shalt not kill.""  It's ""thou shalt not murder"", and given what's at stake here, it's arguable that it wouldn't be murder.  And as a bonus, you can even torture me into repenting before you kill me, so everyone wins!  Once more, harm becomes help.    That's why so many Christian organizations have gone around trying to wipe out anyone who follows another religion for a pretty good portion of their existence.  Of course, they aren't doing this now because people finally got sick of all the fucking bloodshed and started ignoring the nastier implications of their religion. And I don't think that most modern Christians in our society are bloodythirsty monsters just waiting to leap out and start murdering atheists to save people from Hell.  Honestly, if it came down to being forced to do something like that, I think a lot of our Christians would give up their religion long before turning on their neighbors like that.    But not all of them are like that.  Don't forget, every fascist state on Earth in the 20th century had an army and secret police made up of dedicated Christians.  The whole ""my way or the highway"" attitude encouraged by Christianity makes things like that possible.  And that's why I think it's so important for us to speak out against it, because it's very possible that it will hurt us all again in the future."
ainbow,3d5vrc,izzgo,9,Tue Jul 14 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"Even if a christian was gay or fine with gays and all, what are the chances that they are also trans-friendly? Very small. Religions are dogmas pushed to children when they are young enough to take this as the truth, it is brainwashing and it is completely immoral and sick. Keep in mind that if someone is religious, we shouldn't bash them unless they are chanting their gospel to us trying to convert us or demonize us. Like some Christians say, blame the sin and not the sinner. We shouldn't blame the kids who were brainwashed if they end up religious, it's only if they themselves do bad things because of religion that we should be angry at them."

There's a difference between a man squealing #notallmen, and a man actively calling out his male friends for sexist behavior. The former is irrelevant and insensitive, but the latter is one of the things that's going to move the needle and change sexist behavior. We're never going to be rid of men, but we can work to make men better. We're also never going to be rid of religion, no matter how hard you argue in that direction.

Regarding #Notallmen...Feminism doesn't seek to get rid of men, but it does seek to eliminate patriarchy. But I suppose that an actually accurate analogy would have caused you to admit that religion is a harmful, inherently oppressive system.   To continue the analogy...A christian is like a man who embraces patriarchy. A volunteer stakeholder in a toxic system."

It think it is a very real and okay place to be coming from to say ""I have a real problem with what christianity stands for and it has no place in my life."" Nothing about Leviticus or the last 1,000+ years of brutality towards the LGBT community is subtle or confusing. Christianity might be embracing love now that they've lost the privilege that once let them beat, kill, and imprison us with impunity but us older folks still have the scars both mental and physical to remember when ""christian love"" meant limping around half the time and living in fear of getting beat up again and again by some pious classmates who were issued a blank check to do almost whatever they pleased by the christian adults in charge.

I genuinely believe that they are trying to do what they think Christ would have wanted them to do. That's the heart of Christianity- following Jesus Christ and his teachings. And they genuinely believe that Christ would have been accepting and welcoming of gay people. I think if you read just his words, it's not much of a stretch at all to believe that. The bible is just a book. If you believe that then there's no reason any mental gymnastics have to be done to be a Christian and have no problem with homosexuality.   edit: regardless of all that, I still think it's important to be welcoming to LGBT Christians.

Somehow your great insights escaped them while they were castrating gay men across medieval Europe.  It wasn't even on their radar when gay men were being thrown in prisons, mental institutions, and concentration camps in Christian countries throughout the early 20th century.    But now that society has started to change and homophobia is finally being rejected, they've suddenly realized that widespread brutal homophobia isn't what Jesus really wanted?

I'm not saying Christianity hasn't been homophobic. It's been EXTREMELY homophobic. As a whole, I am not generally a fan of Christianity (or any of the Abrahamic religions, or any religion at all, really).

But there is absolutely no reason to say disparaging things towards Christians who aren't anti-LGBT.   You say you respect gay Christians, but I see no evidence of this.

The bible was written at varying times after the death of Jesus (and, of course, the old testament was written before then- also by humans and also over a long period of time). Liberal Christians tend to believe that some of it is probably true, and some of it is probably not. And some of it probably made sense in the time it was written but don't make sense now.    Nearly all followers of the bible (Jews, Muslims, Christians- conservative and liberal alike) work this way. For example, I don't think there are any followers of the abrhamic religions left that practice ritual animal sacrifice, even though this is a big deal in the bible.   Further, the interpretation of the bible's prohibitions on homosexual acts is one of great scholarly interest- with most academics believing that the new testament's mentioning of homosexuality was not referring to consensual, loving acts between adults who are only attracted to members of the same sex, but rather probably referring to non-consensual acts by Roman soldiers on male children.

If that's really what it's supposed to mean, then why didn't the author just write that instead? Do you really want to argue that Christianity isn't homophobic, but it still managed to kill and oppress LGBT people for centuries due to sloppy, shitty writing? That's also wrong.  The church fathers wrote about homosexuality and pederasty as distinct behaviors, and they clearly condemned them both.

It's not like in the bible it comes right out and says ""you should definitely be against 2 people of the same gender who love each other and want to marry"" or ""you should disown your child if they are gay"" either. Some Christians interpret the parts about homosexuality in the bible one way, and others another way. It's all pretty silly and vague anyway.    Do you really want to argue that Christianity isn't homophobic   No, I don't. I absolutely do agree that Christianity, as a whole, has been extremely homophobic throughout history, and continuing through today. It's also been extremely sexist, racist, violent, and absurdly hypocritical. And I think most liberal Christians would agree with that.  Again, I am not Christian, nor do I think that Christianity is a big warm fluffy church of loving everyone. Obviously, it's not. I'm simply trying to explain why liberal Christians believe what they do and to argue that not all of them are simply acting opportunistically to keep people from leaving the church.

Not by looking into etymology, or historical circumstances, or any of the arguments used to nullify certain passages  There is often no history of these gymnastics being a part of the religion until it comes time to phase out older, bigoted, readings of the bible.  They're brought out as a last ditch attempt to stay relevant rather than being a regular method of interpretation and reinterpretation.  As a result it feels feigned in a way.    Compare that to, say, more liberal forms of Judaism where these sorts of gymnastics are part and parcel of the religion(two Jews three opinions, as the saying goes)."

Even more importantly, the Talmud actually has stories of times when humans actually actively defied God in the pursuit of taking the right action, and this action is seen as honorable and moral. The more liberal denominations tend to believe that, after the transmission of the laws to Moses, humans are tasked with developing their own interpretation of the world and what's moral and not moral, not God. That's made Judaism, outside of small Orthodox sects, far more accepting of LGBT people than other religions."

Modern tolerance/acceptance of homosexuality came about because of the hard work of many, many gay activists and allies.  However, it's also because the circumstances of modern life allow for it.  Think about it.  If anything, we have far, far too many people on the planet at the moment.  Nobody anywhere needs to worry about making more babies.  Hence all of the religious injunctions against wasting sperm aren't taken seriously.  Not like during Biblical times, at least.  BUT - the moment something happens... could be bird flu... or a world war... who knows?  The moment things aren't so easy then those clobber verses are going to come back into fashion... because they're still there.  The fact that some nice people are ignoring them for the time being doesn't matter.  At some point the baby and the bathwater are indistinguishable.  MLK said something about the arc of history bending toward justice.  I would humbly disagree.  I think there are good times and bad times.  Sometimes, history allows for people to be kind.

I think it's ridiculous how we act all superior to people who reject GSM people when we do the exact same thing. Just because we aren't rejecting them because they're GSM doesn't make it suddenly okay for them.  We need to decide if we're advocates for the dignity and equality of GSM people and those who endorse that, or a place for one specific worldview."

I feel like all people should be welcomed even if we disagree with someone's core beliefs.  Speaking as an atheist, some of my best friendships have been with my Christian or Catholic friends. Sure, the difference in beliefs can strain the friendship, but it can also allow for amazing conversation when we both attempt to tolerate each other's views."

Not trying to speak on /u/blockedbydan's behalf though, so perhaps my interpretation of their argument is wrong.  But it is an interesting question. Can we accept Christians without accepting Christianity? I want to say yes, but it does open up a whole can of worms.

There are communities out there for them, just like there are communities on reddit (/r/openchristian)  I think the disconnect might be in terms of how the rest of the gay community feels about Christianity.  I don't like it.  I think it's bad news and I don't see anything there to celebrate.  But I won't give you shit about it.  You do your thing, I'll do mine.

ainbow,3d5vrc,boxmole,4,Tue Jul 14 13:47:42 2015 UTC,"I'm in the ""ex-Christian"" camp, but I was probably more closely aligned with the cultural aspect of Christianity.  I think that there's an important distinction to be made between actual Christians and cultural Christians. I rarely have an issue with actual Christians who look at their faith as something that they grow and struggle with. These are usually the Christians who don't let their faith take over their entire lives and see it as a personal relationship with their deity. They're also not easily frenzied by overzealous pastors seeking a way to put butts in seats. They seek answers to conflicts of faith and morality through Biblical study, but still recognize that their sacred text does not have answers to all the questions they may have. They seem to genuinely want to help make their world a better place in conjunction with the tenants of their faith.  Cultural Christians, however, are followers who don't question what other people they respect tell them the Bible says. No matter how passionately devout they seem, their faith is a superficial understanding of popular Biblical verse and they are easily caught up in the latest Christian craze, which they call ""faith"". They're the ones who have to put whatever popular representation of their faith is in vogue all over their belongings (i.e. the fish symbol, ""3:16"", Christian-y catchphrases, the cross in various styles, etc). Non-Christians, who are going to Hell, are dehumanized in their eyes (or at least are seen as ""lesser"" than their superior Christian selves).  Most of my experiences with actual Christians have been positive. We may not agree on many issues, but we treat each other with mutual respect.  Post-coming-out as transgender, most of my experiences with Cultural Christians have been negative and demeaning, usually from completely unprovoked aggression. They can go fuck themselves because they make this world a more hateful place."
ainbow,3d5vrc,dommitor,3,Tue Jul 14 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"I agree.  This thread also demonstrates a lot of assuming that christianity is a monolithic entity with no deviation in belief, ideals, practices, or tradition. There are many denominations, spanning the social and political spectrum."
ainbow,3d5vrc,Handmeafish,5,Mon Jul 13 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure anyone makes that assumption.  Christianity is one of the most fragmented world religions out there.  I once knew a man whose particular Christian beliefs were so specific, he couldn't find a church that affirmed them all.  It's by no means a secret that Christianity is greatly fragmented.  But a lot of sects follow very similar doctrines, and it's easier to identify them under one umbrella, instead of noting that this particular sect only reads from the King James Bible, whereas that sect prefers the New International Version.  Of course, some of the splits are much more drastic than that - the Episcopalian / Anglican church is quite liberal compared to other branches and especially their Roman Catholic progenitors. But you don't often find major theological differences between them - most of the splits are over minor details.  But since you're supposedly talking about the word of the creator and arbiter of everything in the universe, to them,  there is no such thing as a minor detail."
ainbow,3d5vrc,dommitor,4,Tue Jul 14 01:08:30 2015 UTC,"Irrelevant. Their christ says to judge a fruit by the tree that it bears and this is some shitty, toxic fruit."

One thing to note is the difference in Christian denominations. It's unlikely, for example, that you'll find a Southern Baptist priest who would approve of gay marriage, but the denomination I belong to, the Episcopal Church, recently ok-ed gay marriage on a national level (the church-y goverment is complicated and it would take a lot to explain but basically that doesn't mean you can get married anywhere just yet, but close) and many, many people within the Episcopal church are on the right side of this issue. My church has lots of openly gay people [openly is crucial to note because probably every church has gay people in it, haha] and we have blessed and ""married"" (married's in quotes because we can't legally marry same-sex couples yet sadly- we have to do it kind of under the table) same-sex couples for years and years now.   I went to a sex ed thing that they gave to all the younger girls at my church. It was fucking fantastic. It talked about the sexuality spectrum, how everything is perfectly normal and how it's not just ""gay"" and ""straight"", proper birth control use, how sexuality is a very healthy thing and it's part of human life, how gender is very different from sexuality, etc. And they didn't shy away from any topics. One girl put in the question box ""how do gay people have sex?"" and they explained it thoroughly. Nobody in the class was at all disgusted by the topics... maybe just taken aback. But it was such a triumph because all the younger girls in the class (10-12 or so) had this great information so early on in their life.   I love church. Hateful, spiteful ""Christians"" drive me up a wall. Have they ever actually read the bible? Do you know that it says that disowning a family member over their wrongdoing is worse than the actual sin itself? It's frustrating. I am deeply sorry to anyone who has been hated or outcast by someone who called themself Christian just because of who they are. PM me if you need more info about accepting churches or that kind of thing. I don't want any LGBT people to feel like they can't be Christians. You certainly don't have to of course... as long as you are a good person it doesn't matter to me what religion you are (or aren't) :)"

In fact, loving your neighbor and god are the most important rules in the bible. We teach a message of love in my church, and that's love everyone, even gay people. Because that's who they are.    As my priest likes to say, ""We've been using the bible to silence people for so many years. But why use the bible to silence people when we should be listening to them speak their own truths."""

I still have so much self hate from being raised in the church and I don't think I will ever recover from it. Who are you to tell me what will help me heal? If you want me to stop hating Christianity then say your actual reasoning, because pretending it's for my own good or something is such condescending BS. I am certainly helping myself by being hateful toward the church because it's the only way to remind myself they're wrong. Other people's hatred of the church is what helped me and others get out and begin to heal in the first place. So yeah this hatred toward the church actually does help people."

Really it's none of the trainer's business about the sexuality of the client. If the writer wishes to divulge then they can, but it's a business relationship. Unless the trainer's a bigot that doesn't like getting paid money, the trainer's not going to care in the context of the contract. For masculine presenting people assumed heterosexuality can be a bother, but ""My trainer thinks I'm straight and I haven't said anything to correct him about it.

ainbow,3d55p8,RedstarXtreme,5,Mon Jul 13 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"Samsung rejected the gay hookup app Hornet from its South Korean store in 2013, citing local values and laws that disallow LGBT content.   Emphasis mine. Going to the source, which actually communicated with Samsung, some of this could be much ado about nothing.   Samsung appears to list no other LGBT dating apps in its store other than Hornet anywhere in the world, but none of the other app developers contacted by BuzzFeed News say they’ve tried to have their app listed.   So if they devs didn't even try to list it, I don't think people can get too outraged about that. But let's look at Samsung itself here: it's a South Korean company with a relatively checkered past. ""Samsung is the quintessential example of a chaebol, that uniquely Korean brand of conglomerate that mixes Confucian values with family ties and government influence.""  The man running the company had a few big convictions, and was pardoned by not one but two Presidents. Is it any shock that this company would hold rather conservative values and act upon them? It's not like Samsung is a champion of LGBT rights. Samsung practically has a cult around it in South Korea, and I doubt they'd do anything to rock that boat.   But Google Play removed the most popular gay dating app in South Korea, Jack’d, a few years ago, according to LGBT activists in Seoul.   Now, Google on the other hand, raises a little bit more of an eyebrow, but even so it's the removal of just one app. Granted, it was the most popular, but it's just one. The screenshot shown in the Buzzfeed version of the story shows that there's still a ton of these apps in the Play Store. This hardly seems like a huge campaign of censorship right now.    Jack’d’s lead account manager for Asia, Noah Staum, seemed surprised when asked about the delisting by BuzzFeed News, saying that Jack’d has more than 500,000 users in the country. They presumably are getting it by using a VPN that makes it appear as if their phone is in another country; instructions for doing this in Korean are easily found online.   Or, just, you know, sideloading the APK, which is much easier to do.   “I think in this case they would have been asked by the government” to remove the app, said Jillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation   Which makes sense to me. I don't think Google is especially proud of this, which is probably why they're being so tight lipped."

In every part of the world every century for at least the last 10 centuries, there has been some kind of speech that was banned.  Sometimes for good reasons, but it ultimately lead to larger societal problems.  ""Hate speech"" is just another category of this.  We can all hold hands, sing a song, and agree that saying nasty things about minorities is bad can't we?  Of course!  But there is no solid way to define the line between what is hateful and what is simply a deviant idea to someone who could not accept or condone such an idea.  There is no meaningful difference there.  And besides, we should always be erring on the side of expression.  Hateful words and ideas suck, but it's far more important to protect one's ability to express such ideas than it is to protect the feelings of those being attacked.  This is a fundamental principle of why society is functional in any meaningful way.

He's just saying, look, there it is in nature. And those natural populations are not diminished because of it. Seems like a pretty clear answer to me unless I'm missing something... It hardly seems thinly veiled. It's a direct response to the question he was posed."

I have no intention of naturally producing children with a woman. If I do it will be through surrogacy, not through sex. In the past I might have been forced to have them through natural means out of pressure from society to be ""straight"" but now I don't have to deal with that anymore.

Of course you're entirely correct that gay people are human beings and should be treated with the dignity and respect that we afford people in general.  But it's also true that there are biological reasons for homosexuality - and acknowledging those doesn't in any way diminish your point regarding basic dignity and respect.  Knowing the reasons behind something in no way changes appreciation of that something; there are reasons why homosexuality is a benefit on the species level, which is why it persists and is seen in many different species.  That in no way removes any of the meaning that individual gay people have; it's just that we (being science) can explain how gay animals interact with their species, and what benefits there are for a species to have gay members (and it is a benefit to a species as a whole, as much as ridiculous homophobes will wharrgarbl)."

For those who don't know, that's only the condensed name of the act. The full length name of the law is the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  Who is James Byrd, Jr? He was a black man who was brutally beaten, mauled, and ultimately murdered by three white guys (details here).  While a decent portion of this piece focuses on queer people of color specifically, there are general appeals to racial justice without the added touch of queerness. Because of that it's, in my opinion, rather egregious not to give the full name of the law you criticize on the basis of essentially whitewashing the experiences of people of color.  Additionally, gay marriage was also a minor victory for trans people, and I'm not just referring to gay trans people. Some states make it incredibly difficult to change your sex on your legal documents. Hypothetically if you were a transman dating a ciswoman and wanted to marry her but your current legal documents list your gender as female, in a pre-Obergefell country and in a state that banned gay marriage, you wouldn't be able to marry that woman."

James Byrd, Jr. was an African-American who was murdered by three men, of whom at least two were white supremacists, in Jasper, Texas, on June 7, 1998.   Second, it was a rider onto National Defense Authorization Act for 2010. Meaning it was tacked onto a bill that had to pass so it would pass too. There is no grand Military Industrial Complex-Gay Industrial Complex conspiracy. Plus, the threadbare link that because some drone manufacturers give money to the HRC, ""Gay, Inc."" is oppressing people is beyond absurd.  There are other issues, but the last thing I'll say is that just because some good things happened and other good things didn't happen, doesn't mean that the first good things were actually bad."

If we are going to use labels, they need to actually communicate the same message to everyone who receives it.  That's their sole job.  It's very hard to advocate and educate outsiders to this world when the nomenclature is so varied, changes so rapidly, and often times is a field of land mines.

I like using genderqueer when talking to people who don't know as much because it's quite understandable - queer to gender. BUT even though I use the same definition for GQ as I do for non-binary, I don't like the term. I don't like GQ because it defines gender solely as man and woman as that is what I'm ""queer"" to. I feel like this term invalidates itself as a gender because it itself defines gender solely as man and woman. On top of the terms I use I'm also genderfluid but I only ""switch"" between non-binary identities (God fucking damnit is it weird to switch genders...). I switch between neutrois, agender (the ""I don't want to be gendered in the slightest"" one that is described in the article) and leaning feminine but still GQ. I usually don't tell people because I still want to be treated the same way no matter what I currently am.  TL;DR: non-binary gender terms suck  I think that terms for how to be treated would be a lot better because a lot of different GQ identities group together in how they usually want to be treated. Generally bi/trigender peeps want to be treated similar to genderfluid peeps want flexibility on pronouns and names (bad terming time... How about flexigender). Agender, neutrois and peeps who identify solely as GQ or non-binary generally want just a neutral pronoun (more bad terming... How about engender). Etc... If a term is given to each group, then everything would be so much easier to explain to people who don't understand and it would provide a clearer way for other people to know how to treat us folks.  TL;DR: non-binary gender identities can be grouped and named by how they want to be treated  Feel free to disagree with everything I said. Ask me questions if you want. Talk to me, I'm bored.  TL;DR: there's a TL;DR: after each paragraph but here they are anyway: non-binary gender terms suck - Non-binary gender identities can be grouped and named by how they want to be treated."
ainbow,3d05mm,Thatdoctorperson,5,Sun Jul 12 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"It would be very helpful to cisgender individuals if they had some unequivocally ""safe"" terms.  I'm cisgender so I don't really get a say in how the non-cis community wants to identify themselves.  BUT!  If the non-cis community are looking to start some sort of ""nomenclature conference"" these are my humble starting points they might want to work on based on the prefixgendersuffix paradigm from an outsider perspective of what so far has been most prominent.   One Safe Umbrella Everyone Non-Cis falls under (So far no agreement on even a starter term) Perhaps one for binary non-cis (I think this so far is the transmale and transfemale camp) One for a person who bounces around (genderfluid camp?) One for a person who really doesn't care either way (agender camp?)   I think if those four terms were all agreed upon, probably 98-99% of the community would fall under those umbrella terms safely regarding how they want to be treated and their unique needs."
ainbow,3d05mm,sun_wyvern,6,Sun Jul 12 17:43:51 2015 UTC,"The umbrella term exists, it's called transgender (trans being the opposite of the Latin word cis). Some don't like trans but that's mostly because of the heavy association with binary trans people but that association is slowly disappearing. As for the others, if those terms could be created, it would probably be a lot better. I do think you are missing one camp. The non-binary camp. The people who have a gender that doesn't change but it is not binary.  It would be quite hard to implement new terms as a lot of people are attached to their identities and the terms they use now. If terms get created then it's probably going to be decades before they're really used. There is also the problem that this is essentially going back to the problem of putting people into rigid boxes but instead of two boxes, there are a few more. To actually implement this, there needs to be very loose definitions on the terms as to group together identities better. It needs to be part of the definition that not everybody under this term is the same and it is more a group of identities as opposed to an identity.  I hope something can be figured out soon because it's a bit of a mess."

ainbow,3d05mm,Thatdoctorperson,3,Wed Jul 15 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"I thought transgender was a safe term too (as well as trans).  However to give an anecdote.  There have been fights between, say, the term transgender (and trans) vs transgender* (and trans*).  Half of the party thought the asterisk made the situation more inclusive, the other half felt erased.  So who wins?  I do agree it's a mess.  Not every person's special niche term is going to survive this ""make sense"" attempt, but if the outcome is successful they should be able to say ""Yeah I'm still part of this umbrella, I'm just this new word that everyone agrees upon.""  They have to understand the ultimate goal of the label is to convey to others what their situation and needs are."
ainbow,3d05mm,sun_wyvern,6,Sun Jul 12 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"I absolutely hate the asterisk. I used to like it but then I realized that it implies that trans isn't inclusive without the asterisk. It's implies that trans is for binary trans people and only trans* includes non-binary genders. Most people just think oh, look at how inclusive it is, I like that, without realizing the full connotations of it. In a sense it is actually removing the trans identity from non-binary peeps and reducing them to an afterthought stuck on the end of the word.  It's definitely a mess but there is a small chance it can be fixed and that small chance is worth a shot."
ainbow,3d05mm,Thatdoctorperson,4,Sun Jul 12 18:59:22 2015 UTC,I think that's so interesting.  That an attempt at inclusivity could be seen as an act of hostility.  As a cis ally I find this to be the scariest part of the venture.  Hence my analogy to this world as one of landmines.

It's basically saying ""well I acknowledge that more people than LGBT exist, but I'm just gonna throw you a bone to make myself feel more inclusive. Here, take this little star, it's all you deserve""."

ainbow,3d05mm,Thatdoctorperson,6,Mon Jul 13 12:12:02 2015 UTC,"The very idea of gender being a tangible thing that people feel seems really weird to me.

I get that other people perceive it as something they feel, but I've always been pretty apathetic towards the fact that I have a penis and other people refer to me with male pronouns.

Plus, most of us are stealth anyway and don't really care too much when we're treated as cis. Heck, if someone treats me as cis I think that's a wonderful thing.  Same thing with hetero-by-default. Better cisnormativity and heteronormativity than transnormativity and homonormativity. Better tyranny of the majority than tyranny of a minority.

Simply put, the cost of treating an HIV infection will far outweigh the cost or side effects of prophylaxis.  You'll need to get tested at a doctor for a full panel because if he's lied about STDs and was willing to not use condoms, he could likely have all sorts of nasty stuff.  Also, there are no effective vaccines for herpes.  There is a pill that suppresses the virus, preventing transmission, but I honestly doubt he's been taking it.  Honestly, herpes isn't the big thing to be concerned about; FWIW it's most serious effects besides sores are usually due to stress and shame.  Hell, I'm not sure if he's even been taking his HIV antiretrovirals, considering how he's clearly lied about the herpes ""vaccine.""  Get tested, because he's probably far from undetectable.  Long story short: Check for low-cost clinics and get PeP if you are still in the window of effectiveness.  Go to a doctor, ask their advice, and get tested for a full panel.  It will be expensive, but you really need to know early otherwise you'll likely have a far more costly future.  Also, now you know why health professionals really push the use of condoms.  People, even those who ""feel"" friendly and trustworthy, can be manipulative lying sacks of shit.  Seriously, even a BJ or non-penetrative contact should involve a condom."

Its transmission rate for the most risky sexual behaviours is more on the line of 1.5%.  This doesn't mean it's wise to have unprotected contact with someone who is HIV positive, and someone who lies about it certainly should be held criminally liable - and can be in many countries.

So yeah, it turns out when people are afraid, they do tend to stick their head in the sand and plug their ears. I'm not defending it, I'm saying that's how it is, and our actions around prevention and treatment need to be aimed at what works.   Fact is, a single encounter with a HIV+ person isn't guaranteed to lead to transmission. It certainly could, but it's not a foregone conclusion. This is why OP needs to get tested.

ainbow,3d3mni,TurtleTape,16,Mon Jul 13 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"Surgery is one thing, hormones are another. I'm not saying that you necessarily hold this perspective, but many people who have a similar opinion of yours reject the notion of giving any kind of treatment to a transgender minor, and that's problematic.   I don't want to speak for any of the trans women on this subreddit, so I'll just speak from my perspective as a 16 year old trans man with supportive parents. I'll appeal to you as someone who is currently doing what you think is so harmful. Trigger warning, btw.  I'm not an idiot. Not to say that there aren't 16yos who are, but I'm not one. When my doctor explained to my mother and I that hormones could potentially permanently sterilize me, when he said that any surgery I get would be largely permanent, I understood. I know what permanent is.   The thing is, the only reason I was allowed to do this is because my family had exhausted all other options. I've been in therapy since I hit puberty at age 9; the changes that were happening basically made me lose my mind and society's reaction to them made me lose my self-worth. I've been in a mental hospital twice; I've tried to kill myself multiple times. Not all because of dysphoria, but it was a huge contributing factor to my overwhelming notion that life wasn't worth living.  Would you want to go through life trapped in a body that you hated, that you felt alien in, that you felt you couldn't do anything to change? Would you wish that constant discomfort, anxiety, and depression on your child?  It goes much farther than having some hair on your body (or none, in my case).   My mother understood that I understood, and thus allowed me to make the decision. If I come to regret it later in life, then so be it, because I recognize that I've done this in order to not have to either die or to live my life in a mental institution.   Hormones, other than the potential fertility factor, are not permanent. Not completely, anyway, and not in any way that someone can't work around or get used to. People do much more detrimental things in their teens, such as getting tattoos or cutting permanent scars into their bodies. If I quit T today, by the time I'm 18 or so, no one would be able to tell. My self-harm scars are going to last forever, however.  I can't speak on the 13 year old trans kids out there, but for people my age, who are being expected to choose their lifelong careers, we should be allowed to make these decisions about our bodies. Mistakes are mistakes, but rarely does someone get to the point of surgery and come to regret it. In those cases, it's typically because they don't pass regardless of surgery and still face the societal backlash of being trans. The younger you start, the less likely you will have to face that issue.  Ask any older transitioner on this subreddit. I'm sure the majority will tell you that they wished they could have started younger.   I feel like I was all over the place with this post, but basically: you're blowing this out of proportion. No doctor in their right mind will put a young child on hormones. A teenager will only receive them once they've given the doctor reasonable confirmation that HRT is what they need. Most (ethical) surgeons will not operate on minors without multiple confirmations and/or a considerable amount of time on hormones. Regardless of what parents may delude themselves into thinking, they do not know their kids better than the kids themselves do. Especially if you barely have genuine talks with your kid. If you ever turn out to have a trans kid, get them therapy, and be open to the idea of medical transition. Listen to the doctors, they know better than you do.   There are multiple checks in place in order to assuage your exact fears. You're wrong to make a transgender child wait because it's unnecessary and will only serve to alienate your kid. Even if, years down the line, they decide to de-transition, nothing is fully permanent. Worst case, they'll just have to transition in the other direction, but it rarely, if ever, gets that far. And if it does, they shouldn't blame you, because these treatments stand to be life-saving for some.  Edit: syntax"
ainbow,3d3mni,RegularParadox,12,Mon Jul 13 11:34:57 2015 UTC,"It's not just shaving. There would be a thicker jawline, more.prominent brow, sunken cheekbones, thinner lips, broader shoulders, wider rib cage, thicker bones, denser muscles,  longer feet, bigger hands, poorer skin, balding, taller, and excessive facial and body hair. All of these could make it impossible for a trans woman to ever pass. Similarly a trans man could be dealing with a lot of these in opposite along with wider hips making it harder for him to pass. Even if passing didn't matter (sadly it does though), it could still be very hard emotionally.  Finally the older someone is, the less effective hrt can be for physical changes.  that doesn't even get into the emotional trauma from added years of living in distress and mental anguish.    At 12 a child could start puberty suppressants, which are completely reversible. At 15-16 they would be able to start hrt, and at 18 they could have surgery. Studies have been done that show that basically all people who express a trans identity and maintain it into their teenage years will be trans for life. There are many chances to turn back, and someone would have to be among the most privileged to be able to transition as quickly as possible. Which from puberty suppression to surgery would be 6 years. Throughout that whole time there would be many chances to turn back and undo any of the effects of transition.  The leading medical bodies and the Wpath standards of care have a clear outline of treatment courses and diagnoses. If you had a child with any other condition would you really ignore the medical advice given and agreed to by the American Academy of pediatrics, the American Medical association,  the American psychological association,  the American psychiatric association, the American Academy of family physicians, the American public health association,  and more? If not why would you ignore their advice because your child was trans?  Tldr: Transition is widely accepted as the correct treatment. It takes multiple years, and has many chances to turn back. If someone gets to a permanent point like surgery then studies show they most likely would never want to turn back."

ainbow,3d3mni,ScabWingedAngel,14,Mon Jul 13 09:44:26 2015 UTC,"In what way is treating a medical condition with the standard treatment ""the easy way out""? Why should this medical condition remain untreated until 18, since ""teenage years are hard for a lot of people?"" Why specifically this but not other medical conditions?  Once you go through puberty the first time, you cannot go back. Transitioning and having a second puberty is not the same as going through the right one the first time. People regret SRS at an astoundingly low rate (~4%), lower even than the rate that people regret cancer treatments. Among that 4% they found that a huge predictive factor of regret could be traced to lack of family support. This does not argue in favor of there being a problem with the treatment, but a problem with the family.  If you would treat a hormone imbalance in a cis teenager you should do the same for a trans one. Cross-hormone treatment can wait until the late teens but puberty blockers are life saving and they are not permanent. There is a possible risk of infertility if the child changes their mind. There is also the risk of suicide from not allowing the hormone blockers. Personally I'll take an infertile child over a dead one.  I also have absolutely no idea what you're talking about with ""altering the DNA of your body"". Hormones do not alter DNA. The DNA you have is the DNA you have for life."

That is not the issue that transgender youth face, they face the risk of irreversible damage to their ability to fully, physically assume the gender they identify as.

So much can happen during the teen years and as long as I don't live in a homogeneous neighborhood (I live in one of the more accepting places in the world), am I wrong to extend the amount of time my son/daughter has before making the ""cut""?     Yes and fuck you for opening your sound-hole instead of listening to those of us who actually know what the fuck we're talking about.

I think this indicates a cut or open wound inside my anus. Will this increase my chances of contracting HIV?   Do you bottom, generally? This could be an anal fissure. Go get that checked immediately.  If it's not a fissure, it could be an STD. Chlamydia, syphilis and herpes in the anus can cause bleeding.  Aside from the lying, I'd honestly worry more about your anus situation that the guy's HIV situation. He's not wrong in that if he's undetectable, you have a snokeflake's chance in hell of getting infected.  Also, PEP may be ""expensive"" but that's only the pre-insurance price. You should have some kind of health insurance. Even Medicaid covers PEP and PrEP. Hospital E.R.'s and urgent care clinics (which are open 24/7) may even be able to give it to you for free."

ainbow,3cylha,zomboi,5,Sun Jul 12 00:10:54 2015 UTC,The good news is that the chances of you contracting the disease are very low; transmission rates for HIV are a lot smaller than most people realize.  It still doesn't justify his behaviour - and were I you I would be very tempted to file a report with the police. In many places in many countries it is a misdemeanor to a felony to have sex with someone when you know you're HIV positive without disclosing it.
ainbow,3cylha,SharpAtTheEdge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:16:46 2015 UTC,It sounds like your gut was telling you something since you kept asking him if he had any STDs over and over again. Next time go with your gut.  And always assume that the guy has something. Always have safe(r) sex. Never go bareback with a guy you just met and have no trust built with.
ainbow,3cylha,dogslikeus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:28:30 2015 UTC,"Go get PEP. And get tested regularly. If you are active, you should be getting tested at least ever 6 months.  Having someone finger you with their own cum certainly falls (as I understand it) into ""risky"" behavior. It probably isn't as high risk as having him actually cum inside you (because HIV can't live very long at all outside the human body). But there is certainly some risk.  Also, get more sex-ed. The sex-ed you got in school is probably worse than useless. This is not your fault, but it is your responsibility.  Learn what you can do to reduce your risks. And, next time, ALWAYS take precautions. I assume that every partner I have is at risk for transmitting something to me so I practice universal precautions.  I think the decision to call the police is one that only you can make. I would suggest discussing it with someone you are very close to."

One way that I did that was by participating in activities where the environment was pro-LGBT but which didn't stand out to my parents the way me going to an accepting church would. I could talk to my folks about what I was doing who I was spending time with without saying who was what orientation or whatever.  I got involved in the art scene, volunteered at the community theater, and joined a choir (all stereotypically accepting places, but not suspicious to my folks). I also worked at a local library and in a diner. Basically everywhere that wasn't explicitly religious I met people who were more open and accepting than my parents. It helped a lot to make connections outside their social circles.  I see that Winchester has a community theater, and of course high schools have their own theater programs as well. You don't have to be willing to act or sing to get involved. There's always sets to be made, lighting, costumes, sound, and general organization stuff. Theater will suck up as much time as you're willing to invest in it without producing any money, so you might want to wait until you have a handle on balancing working part-time and school. At the same time it can be a wonderful escape, and an inspiring way to occupy your mind with better things."

ainbow,3cv74r,AmericantDildont,5,Mon Jul 13 22:27:04 2015 UTC,"Well, it's hard to give advice without knowing the specifics of your situation.  But here's my list of stuff I did to cope in that situation, along with some things I should have done.   Build a support network.  Find an LGBT, secular, or left-leaning political youth group in your area if there is one.  If there's not one in your area, come out to some friends you know you can trust.  If you can't do that, then find someone you can talk to online.  This is important, especially if you consider yourself to be on the verge of mentally breaking down.  The only thing shittier than being closeted is being completely closeted and alone. Find something to occupy your time if you haven't already.  Join a school club or find a hobby.  It'll take your mind off the shit you have to put up with, and it'll give you an excuse to spend time away from your parents. Exercise.  It'll make you feel better now, and you'll be in a better position to get a good looking boyfriend whenever you are able to come out.  The investment definitely pays off, so start running or weightlifting or something now if you haven't already. Read books and articles.  Follow LGBT, atheist, and left-leaning subreddits.  It's psychologically fulfilling to be able to debunk all the crap your parents are saying, even if you can't speak up about it. Stay strong.  I know it's a cliche at this point, but it really does get better once you're out on your own.  Unless you get kicked out before you're ready to be independent.  You probably know this already, but I keep hearing more sad stories about this so it bears repeating.  Don't come out to your parents.  It's not worth it, there are so many things that could go wrong.  Just keep your head down and do what you can to build for your future.   Edit:  Also, you might want to post this on /r/askgaybros too."
ainbow,3cv74r,AmericantDildont,12,Sat Jul 11 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"Find an LGBT, secular, or left-leaning political youth group in your area if there is one.   I kind of disagree with that, depending on the area. In small, insular areas, it's easy to get recognized and outed involuntarily. I know of at least one gay kid in my area who was seen talking to the leader of the GSM at the high school (of which I remember the huge shitfest over its founding when I was there) by another kid spying on them, who told his parents, and eventually was outed and bullied by his family/Mormon church leaders/other kids at school until he killed himself. After which the parents bullied the coroner into listing it as ""death by misadventure"" so the family wouldn't be sullied by having a suicide in the family and to avoid him showing up in suicide statistics.  Sorry to be a downer, but I have little trust in other people to keep secrets, and much more confidence in the likelyhood of someone being a gossip. Maybe it's just the area I live in."

ainbow,3cv74r,fun_for_all,4,Sat Jul 11 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"You're from Winchester? I used to live in Stephens City. Honestly I think your best bet is to try to make some friends closer to the city if you can. I am an atheist and a huge LGBT ally. I had a really hard time with the religious stuff out there. I moved closer in and it is so much better. Fairfax County is much more open minded. Loudoun County has pockets of it, but I think to a much lesser degree. If you have a car, I would suggest doing the drive out to Fairfax county and meeting some locals out here. If you can't drive, then meet them online and at least have that building block of community for when you can drive.   I'll see if I can look up the local stuff for you. Hate to break it to you, but Winchester is not forward thinking at all. You will find random friends here or there, but most that don't think like that move away.   Edit: here is the Winchester PFLAG: http://www.pflagofwinchester.com/ I hope this helps. I really do. Literally if you move an hour east, things could change drastically for you."

If seeing a school counselor, beware that the counselor maybe trying to get patients caught up in the mental health community, often pushing medications and therapy that may make things worse for the patient.  Being a mental patient can cause a stigma and make it more difficult to proceed with career plans such as finding a job.  Also counselor sometimes share 'confidential' information with others, such as rather or not you were referred to a psychiatrist or put on medications or receiving therapy."

As far as bar goes, there are some famous variants.  The Eagle in many cities might actually fit your description.  There are square dancing bars in some cities for the country set.  In San Francisco there is Lone Star which is a bear bar likely to play rock or even country music.  There is also Truck and some more basic variants like Elephant Walk and Moby Dick that are more oriented toward older folks and conversation.  Sports bars are kind of a hard sell because the clients for such places tend to be mostly straight.  Sometimes subcultures don't mix in a straightforward way.  I know gay skateboarders, but gays into skateboarders tend to be a different set that doesn't mix well because they don't skateboard.  You may have to live with your preferred cultural entertainment and socialization venues being different from where you go to meet men and socialize with other gay people which isn't necessarily a terrible thing."

ainbow,3cton3,platinumarks,19,Tue Jul 14 06:45:39 2015 UTC,"One of the saddest parts of that blog post, and one that the author never really addresses, is that it's all about what the author wanted and felt.  It's all about them wanting to be ""closer to God,"" them looking to the Bible for answers, them leaving the relationship. Nowhere does it even begin to address their former partner's feelings, desires, plans for the future, or anything like that. There are two people in every relationship, and the article frankly comes across as saying that if you believe God is telling you to leave the relationship, well by golly, that's just what you've gotta do right now.  I'd be interested in seeing an article from the former partner's perspective, because what we get in this article is, quite frankly, a huge dose of selfishness on the part of the author. They seem to lack any acknowledgement of the harm they caused to their former partner by spending the better part of a decade in a relationship with them, and then suddenly waking up one day and deciding that God hates your relationship and wants you out of it.  That's callousness at a high level, and would be just as callous if the decision didn't derive from religion, but somehow we're supposed to see it as less callous because, well, gosh, it wasn't the author that was responsible for the end of the relationship, it was God. Quite frankly, that's heartless and cruel to foist onto someone else that you supposedly loved for so long.  As an aside, I'm not trying to inherently bash religion and say that all religions are, by definition, a bad influence. What I do have a problem with, though, is someone spending years in a relationship with someone, building a life with them, and then throwing that away under the guise of religion (or anything else, for that matter). If you believe the relationship was so bad for you, decide that at the beginning, not eight years down the line when you've committed yourselves to each other. Don't drag another person through the mud because of your hangups. Be honest from the beginning."

I think a bit reason for that is that homophobia, religious or otherwise, requires a degree of dehumanization. It's why you hear pro-gay activists talking about families and love and you hear anti-gay activists talking about sex acts and lifestyles. The further you keep the issue away from actual people and actual lives, the easier it is to accept homophobia.  So this person, obviously, was suckered into homophobia. It only makes sense that part of that process was to stop thinking about the person they loved and start viewing it all as some sort of a lewd act that they, themselves, did and need to stop."

They seem to not realize how insanely many arbitrary assumptions go into their natural law conclusions, ranging from assuming they know the sole use penises are meant to have based on outdated biological ideas, to that every use has to happen at once for it not to be wrong, to for some reason its only wrong to use it wrong, not to not use it and be a priest who is failing to use its functions, to that despite people naturally ejaculate whether or not they use it apparently that doesn't make it obvious that it wasn't designed to only ejaculate during straight sex, to assuming that its not just wrong but a severe evil rather than a moderate vice, etc.  They don't seem to grasp that an argument existing doesn't make it good. There's a reason no one but conservative christian ethicists take those arguments seriously in ethics. And its because the only way they can look ""good"" is as a post hoc rationalization for something you assume is true. Starting at the beginning you would never reach there, since there's about 30 arbitrary axioms, each of which alone is less plausible than more normal theories wit things like ""causing suffering is bad."""

Something to be chosen once you have your own income and can make genuine decisions without fear of parental opprobrium.  For a gay person, having Christianity forced down your throat at an early age only leads to misery, as the article demonstrates.  But if an adult gay man or woman decides that Christianity is, indeed, THE WAY, and they should remain celibate, fine.  Still, it's a choice that has to be made without coercion.  And, since most Christians feel that even the youngest lives - even the unborn - have rights and need to be defended, they can't possibly disagree with the right of a young person to wait and choose their own faith.

If they pretend otherwise, its usually based on things they consider less important. Anti gay christians don't think its a cultural or personal or up for discussion thing, but an important moral fact that they need people, an especially their kids to know.   The real solution is just going to be tat over time, there's no one left anti gay enough to prop up those bubbles, and christianity will adopt doctrines that downplay sex differences."
ainbow,3cton3,monarchynotdemocracy,-1,Sat Jul 11 03:55:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, all parents share their own moral code with their children.  But in this instance, the moral code happen to be toxic.  It's like having two white supremacists adopt and raise a black child - reminding the kid at every possible opportunity that he or she is inferior, despicable, and unworthy of love.  I'd certainly have a big problem with that.  Wouldn't you?  There is more than enough evidence that Christianity is harmful to gay people, both on the personal and political levels, so it's really tantamount to child abuse.  And, with all due respect, I think you have an incredibly rosy view of the future.  There will always be anti-gay people and attitudes, and Christianity will be there to support and bolster those views.  Again, I'm not suggesting that people who want to be Christian can't make that choice, but it's not appropriate for it to be forced on a child, especially if they're not even aware of their own sexuality.  All the parents have to do is wait and see... which isn't terribly difficult if they're genuinely interested in free choice as opposed to indoctrination and brainwashing.  Just give people a choice.  Not so much to ask, really."

Its basically an attempt to trick people with bad ideas into not teaching their kids them. But no one would actually fall for this, since they would have to ask themselves what to instead. And what? Some set of ethics and concepts they don't believe? This only makes sense since you assume that what you think is a default they would somehow agree is a default despite disagreeing with it. But that makes no sense. They would think that doing so is actively teaching them things they think are wrong.  If their ideas are bad, their ideas are bad. And in this case they are.

ainbow,3cobv2,cheese93007,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:06:42 2015 UTC,"Some federal statutes still recognized people as married only if they currently lived in a state that recognized their marriage. Windsor didn't explicitly overturn that aspect of those statutes, so they were still enforced, albeit with the goal of eventually overturning that.  Social Security and Veteran's Administration benefits were big examples of statutes that still didn't recognize same-sex couples as married if their state of residence didn't recognize their marriage. So, even if a couple was married in California, if they moved to Texas the federal laws for those benefits still required the government to not provide benefits that were reserved for spouses. It was a thorny bit of law, but one that now is rectified by the Supreme Court ordering all states to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages."

For the important part   North Carolina’s new bill presents unique challenges. Due to its language, SB 2 does not fall under the purview of the Obergefell decision. As Noah Feldman wrote in a Bloomberg View article, SB 2 will remain in effect — for now. “On its face, the law doesn’t affect the right to marry. Rather, it establishes a new right for in-state officials not to preside at same-sex marriages.”  The law does not specifically target same-sex marriage. It affords “protection” to individuals who work as state officials and claim religious objections to any lawful marriage. Yet because interfaith and interracial marriages have been accepted (and legally protected) for decades, the underlying intent of SB 2 is clear: to make same-sex marriage as difficult as possible."
ainbow,3coo9r,night-shark,2,Thu Jul 9 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"I am not terribly concerned about the viability of this legal theory.   Lemon and McCreary (two cases the article refers to) stand for the principal that government display of religious symbols can, if not done very specifically and carefully, constitute an endorsement of religion that violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. Remember, that in this type of scenario, the actions of government employees would be attributed as actions of the government itself.   Marriage license denials add a whole other element to the equation: the denial of a fundamental right to a third party. So now, instead of a government action that has the appearance of (1) endorsing religion, you have a government action with the appearance of (1) endorsing religion that also (2) violates a persons rights under the 14th Amendment. This additional element does not weaken the principals upheld in Lemon and McCreary, it in fact strengthens them.  It's a dead end. Some folks will chase it, no doubt but it won't make it to the Supreme Court."

ainbow,3cn8c9,night-shark,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"I'm Canadian and don't understand. In Canada, churches do what they want to do and many don't recognize or perform same sex marriages (although many do). If a church was set up that didn't want to recognize interracial marriages, marriages occurring after divorce, or marriages where there was premarital sex, the government wouldn't care all that much (well, they might spy on them, but then again, these are the times we live in).  The big difference is probably that in Canada non-profits are not supposed to be overly political. Your mandate has to be helping people or the community with political activism on the side or not a huge draw on your resources. People can still get around it relatively easily. For example, if Planned Parenthood wanted to do some sort of political advocacy, all they would have to do is get members to form a separate volunteer group and say that the time and money spent was not part of Planned Parenthood per se. It's just private citizens doing their private citizen thing. Same process can be done with churches.  So in the US, how would objecting to something make you lose your tax-free status? Many churches don't like abortions or premarital sex, but those things are legal. Hell, some churches practice polygamy, which is not recognized by the state, but they get to do what they want behind closed doors. I'd be happy to support a church that opposed the death sentence, which is also legal in some states.  If the government tried to pick on churches' tax free status for not liking same sex marriage, wouldn't that open the door for a LOT of other issues? How are churches supposed to show dissent?  I don't agree with their dissent but in Canada we have a conservative government right now and I would fear if the government started yanking away tax free status from any organization that disapproved of the government (our gov has already been accused of doing this)."
ainbow,3cn8c9,need_more_hours,4,Thu Jul 9 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"To start off with, it's worth pointing out that Canada doesn't have a separation of Church and State, so the discussion is necessarily very different from that in the US.   So in the US, how would objecting to something make you lose your tax-free status?   It's not the objection that's the issue, it's forcing other people to go along with it (as they always seem to have to do) when the objection negatively impacts a protected class of people.  The case that built the Religious Right involved the IRS revoking the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University because of their racist policies.  Bigoted Christians are afraid that the same could happen to religious schools, and other organizations besides actual churches, that have anti-GSM policies in place.  Churches could still do whatever they want, more or less, in my understanding.   If the government tried to pick on churches' tax free status for not liking same sex marriage, wouldn't that open the door for a LOT of other issues? How are churches supposed to show dissent?   I don't believe churches would be targeted, as they have the some of the strongest speech protections from governmental intrusion.  Even so, revoking tax-exempt status is a long shot from not allowing certain churches to exist.  I personally don't think churches should have tax-exempt status anyway, but even I disagree with the government deciding churches tax status based on approval of their speech."
ainbow,3cn8c9,Ghostofazombie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:16:36 2015 UTC,"We kind of have separation of church and state, it just comes in a backwards sort of way. We don't have formal separation as our head of state is the Queen of England and she's also the head of the church of England, but our charter does guarantee freedom of religion (including freedom from religion in most of the cases the courts have looked at).  Still, thanks for the clarification. The US sometimes seems so similar and then other times it seems very foreign. I was only in high school when same sex marriage was passed in Canada through the courts, but I don't remember anyone refusing to issue licenses. I mostly remembered the debate fizzling quite quickly as although people were willing to block rights, they weren't willing to take them away.  Did this same sort of behaviour (refusing licenses and fears of attacks on churches) come after interracial marriage was allowed? Did polling stations not let women vote after they were given the right?"
ainbow,3cn8c9,need_more_hours,2,Thu Jul 9 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"Did this same sort of behaviour (refusing licenses and fears of attacks on churches) come after interracial marriage was allowed?    I'm not old enough to know firsthand, but according to Wikipedia:   Despite the Supreme Court's decision, anti-miscegenation laws remained on the books in several states, although the decision had made them unenforceable. Local judges in Alabama continued to enforce that state's anti-miscegenation statute until the Nixon administration obtained a ruling from a U.S. District Court in United States v. Brittain in 1970. In 2000, Alabama became the last state to adapt its laws to the Supreme Court's decision, when 60% of voters endorsed a ballot initiative that removed anti-miscegenation language from the state constitution.   This is not a big surprise, given Alabama's (and, frankly, the South's) history of state-sponsored bigotry and refusal to accept when they've lost (see: slavery, the Civil War/confederate flag bullshit, public school racial integration, same-sex marriage, etc.).  For a good laugh/cry, take a look at this map of states that resisted legalizing interracial marriage until SCOTUS issued its decision, then compare it to a map of states that resisted same-sex marriage.   Did polling stations not let women vote after they were given the right?   As far as I could tell from a quick Google search, no this did not happen.  It is important to note, however, that women's suffrage was a much more gradual process and was passed as a constitutional amendment rather than a SCOTUS ruling."

Who it would affect, however, are religious schools and things of that nature. In the case General Slattery cited, a private Christian university lost it's tax exempt status because of rules they had in place prohibiting interracial dating and marriage. It is likely that in the near future we will see something similar occur with bans on same-sex dating and marriage, as well we should.   We prohibit certain religious expressions all the time when they conflict with a compelling government interest. For example, we don't allow child sacrifices, or a Jehovah's Witness family from refusing their child a blood transfusion."

This is also how we treat, say, the right to life: the government cannot kill you (mostly) but is not constitutionally obligated to provide you with life-saving care.  Freedom of speech would be another example: the government cannot silence you but is generally not obligated to provide you with a platform."

So, if gay people want to have a child that's biologically related to one of them, they'd better hope that they have 100,000 dollars in disposable income."
ainbow,3ckp0l,Shamwow22,4,Thu Jul 9 15:34:00 2015 UTC,"pre-edit: so this ended up way longer than I meant, but I'm on lunch and having fun so ... here we are.  I identify generally as a progressive, but I could see the argument that my particular position here is conservative, insofar as I don't want the government to pay for something.  Having said that, I think there's more nuance here.  If someone proposed a plan for the government to provide everyone in the US with, say, a car then I doubt that we woulds say opposition to such a proposal is really ""conservative"".  Now, obviously children are far more important than cars, but the analogy is just meant to make it clear that saying ""no"" to spending is not sufficient to be conservative.  Core to my beliefs as a progressive is that society is responsible for creating and perpetuating substantive inequalities and that it therefore has a duty to help correct those inequalities.  My opposition to this plan (which isn't settled, since honestly I haven't researched it or anything) is because it fails to meet this standard in two ways:   The inequality we're talking about here is not society's fault.  The fact that we can't have natural kids (in most circumstances) is a fact of biology, and although I acknowledge the pain that some people may feel at not being able to have a child, the presence of that pain is just something people have to deal with; that people feel some element of their circumstances is shitty is not enough justification for government action.  As Rawls says in Social Unity and Primary Goods:    [T]he citizens as a collective body, accepts responsibility for maintaining the equal basic liberties and fair equality of opportunity...while citizens (as individuals)... accept the responsibility for revising and adjusting their ends and aspirations in view of the all-purpose means they can expect, given their present and foreseeable situation. This division of responsibility relies on the capacity of persons to assume responsibility for their ends and to moderate the claims they make on their social institutions in accordance with the use of primary goods. Citizen’s claims to liberties, opportunities, and all-purpose means are made secure from the unreasonable demands of others.* [emphasis added]   In other words, although we have a collective responsibility to ensure we're all treated fairly (as in my statement of principle above), we also have an individual responsibility to ensure that what we ask for is fair.  It is thus important to note that there are fair ways to deal with the desire to become a parent.  As I mentioned, I'm definitely in favor of a government subsidy for adoption fees, since that also serves an important social purpose.  So I don't feel that I'm denying gay couples the ability to have a child; I'm denying them the ability to have a subsidy to have a biologically related child, which is a much more narrowly-tailored personal desire.  Going back to my car example, I know that transportation is very important to economic opportunity, and so as a progressive am a supporter of a variety of policies to improve access to transportation for the poor -- like mass transit, ride-sharing, municipal bike programs, etc ..., but that doesn't mean that I think a person who specifically wants a Honda Civic to travel in has the right to have that Civic.  Having children could be interpreted as generally important to ""being a person"", and so the government might have an interest in allowing that to happen, but should not recognize a right to have a specific kind of child in a specific kind of way.   I don't believe that the inequality we're discussing is substantive.  There are a lot of ways to define this, but I think I'd go with something like Kant's treatment of the civil condition in the Doctrine of Right, which basically just says that the state has a right to coerce some people into paying for others if such a coercion serves the purpose of ensuring those others have access to society in a meaningful way -- for example, that they can own property, vote (though Kant did not actually so much care about this one), and otherwise pursue their own ends.  In other words, short people are at somewhat of a disadvantage in society, as are bald men, in both cases statistical evidence indicates that they might be paid less or have more trouble finding partners, but although this is an inequality (and even one at least somewhat perpetuated by society), this inequality does not overly burden a short or bald person's attempt to pursue their own ends or access general society; contrast this with a handicapped person's access to society in a world without the ADA.  As such, the government is not obligated to provide, say, lifts to short people or hair transplants to bald ones.  And, back to our point, since the inability to have biological children does not, in my mind, constitute a substantive inequality, then the government is not obligated to provide child-having means.            * See also Scanlon's summary of this position:   The idea is this. The ‘basic structure’ of society is its legal, political, and economic framework, the function of which is to define positions to which different powers and economic rewards are attached. If a basic structure does this in an acceptable way – if citizens have no reasonable complaint about their access to various positions within this framework or to the package of rights, liberties, and opportunities for economic reward that particular positions present them with – then that structure is just. It is up to individuals, operating within this framework, to choose their own ends and make use of the given opportunities and resources to pursue those ends as best they can. How successful or unsuccessful, happy or unhappy they are as a result is their own responsibility."

Attorney client privilege is the privilege not to testify in court against your client.  These are things that a cilvil authority grants you the ability to do.  Having a child is not like those things nor should it be.  The right to have a child is the same as the right to body autonomy.  Something you were born with and something that can not justly be taken away by anyone.  It is a right, a reproductive right."
ainbow,3ckp0l,shiftbackslash,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"Having children in not a privilege, it is a right. Privileges can be taken away for various reasons,   This is not a sufficient definition, since rights can be taken away too.  The most obvious example comes from the 5th amendment:   No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law   which has been read to imply that one can be deprived of your various rights with due process of law -- hence the State's ability to lock people up.  Most people would think of voting as a right, but you can also lose it - along with your right to bear arms.    People often think of rights as being absolutely inviolate, but the whole point of theories of justice -- like say the Lockean social contract upon which our country is based -- is to deal with the fact that in a society rights will necessarily come in conflict with one another and there must be means to arbitrate between rights claims.  Having a child may be a right --- though as I mentioned in another comment it would almost certainly be a negative right -- but whether or not it can be taken away does not give us enough information to classify it."

Here is the difference between positive and negative rights.  Positive rights giving you the right to do something and negative rights giving you the right not to have to do something.    Let's talk about the difference between a right and a privilege.  A privilege is something an authority grants you the ability or authority to do, driving is an easy example.  A right is something inalienable, something you are born with, like the body autonomy to have a child.  No one has to get permission from the government to have a child in the US.

Here is the difference between positive and negative rights. Positive rights giving you the right to do something and negative rights giving you the right not to have to do something.    Well, first this is incorrect.  Since I initially brought up negative rights, it might reasonably be inferred that I know what they are.  Positive rights do not ""give you the right to do something"", that would be negative rights (well, more properly both kinds).  As others have brought up, your right to bear arms is a negative right but you'll notice that it's a right ""to do something"" (own a gun).  Positive rights are rights that oblige others to provide you with something; this is pointed out in the second sentence of your link:   According to this view, positive rights usually oblige action, whereas negative rights usually oblige inaction   When they say ""positive rights oblige action"" they mean that they force someone to give you something or do something for you.  For example, a positive right to gun ownership would mean that ""someone"" (society) would be obligated to give you a gun.  But it's a negative right because what actually occurs is that the right to bear arms prevents someone from taking a gun away from you (""oblige inaction"").  Your interpretation of a positive right is factually incorrect.    If you need more convinving, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy also have very easy-to-read coverage:   A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right (Narveson 2001).   emphasis added   A privilege is something an authority grants you the ability or authority to do, driving is an easy example. A right is something inalienable, something you are born with, like the body autonomy to have a child.   Granted.  But what you wrote next doesn't follow.   No one has to get permission from the government to have a child in the US.    Well, first that doesn't prove it's a right, only that it's unregulated behavior.  I can choose right now, without permission, to go to a store any buy clothing made with child labor, but if the government were to forbid the sale and purchase of such clothing at some point in the future they would not be denying me a right.  It's important to note here that I'm not denying that childbearing is or might be a right, only that your reasoning is sufficient to demonstrate it.  Second, and again, this only proves that childbearing might be a negative right, which I always allowed is possible and which would not change my opinion on this article since it's about the positive provision of means to have a child.   Something that can not be justly taken away.    I responded to this extensively already:   People often think of rights as being absolutely inviolate, but the whole point of theories of justice -- like say the Lockean social contract upon which our country is based -- is to deal with the fact that in a society rights will necessarily come in conflict with one another and there must be means to arbitrate between rights claims."

I don't know, I feel like Having a child is already a positive right it is just conceiving that child that is in contention.    The healthcare that most states provide is not a right for the most part.  A state could choose not to have, say, the CHIP-S program and nobody would be able to bring a civil rights suit about it.  This is actually one of the reasons we don't have universal healthcare.  If healthcare were a (positive) right, then the government would have to provide you with healthcare.  Instead what the government currently does is choose to provide you with healthcare since they think it's a good policy.  That is, you as a citizen have the right to access healthcare programs because they're written into law and stopping you would be discriminatory; but the state could repeal the law tomorrow and you would have no rights-based recourse in the courts.  This situation is very different in Western Europe where they traditionally recognize far more positive rights.  It does get more complex because I know, for example, that hospitals are obligated to provide you with life-saving emergency care, but I don't know if the foundation for that is only statutory or if there is a ruling that the requirement stems from constitutionally protected rights.   This is a new argument though, before I have only been arguing that it is in fact a right not a privilege.   I consider them related because since the Maryland decision is about positive rights, then even if childbearing is a right, that's not enough to prove that we should do the Maryland plan, hence my saying:   this only proves that childbearing might be a negative right, which I always allowed is possible and which would not change my opinion on this article since it's about the positive provision of means to have a child.   I wrote a more thorough (as in, waaay too long) comment with a more detailed explanation of why I think that healthcare should generally be a recognized positive right, IVF for gay (and probably other) couples shouldn't be, here, if you're interested."

And they were able to get away with appropriating the culture for a long time because radical feminists outnumbered lesbians. Their influence in the queer community only dwindled because radical feminism became unpopular with the rise of the third wave. Yet even today, people uncritically publish people like Bindel for queer perspectives and it's maddening.

But you're right, more reasons to oppose terfs are always welcome, I guess my comment was a little unnecessarily bitter. It just agitated me that the top comment in a thread about internal transphobia in the lgb community moved away from that to lgb issues so quickly.   I can understand why you'd feel that way, but understand that my intent was to bring a commentary on political lesbianism (by a transgender flagged individual) back to relevance to the topic of transgenderism by emphasizing LGBTQ solidarity."

ainbow,3cjidm,friendlysoviet,10,Wed Jul 8 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"I was so surprised (and delighted) to see a transwoman dealing with a TERF being portrayed in the first episode of Sense8. I imagine Lana Wachowski has dealt with plenty of TERFs in her time since coming out. If you haven't watched Sense8 I recommend it. Good queer representation IMO.  Anyway, the conservative ""transgender don't real"" mother is an obvious character that people can easily hate but it's good to see Nomi dealing with transphobia from both ends of the spectrum. I say ""good to see""... It's awful and it hurts but it's important to present as part of a transgender person's reality."
ainbow,3cjidm,cygne,18,Thu Jul 9 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"The comments in this very thread are pretty telling, to be honest.

ainbow,3cjidm,evilpenguin234,2,Wed Jul 8 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"It goes both ways. You cannot voice a different opinion on the subject of transgender here without being mocked and barraged with downvotes. If there was open, respectful discussion about transgender rights then there wouldn't be a need for the trolls to completely make a mockery of us.  The T definitely belongs in LGBT. However, it's a much more difficult fight than the LGB fight. The fight for transgender rights is going to be much slower and tougher than those of the LGB representation. This makes a lot of transgender people point the finger at LGB peoples (especially gay men) and accuse them of forgetting the T, which in turn makes the fight that much longer and tougher.  I want to help transgender individuals the way many helped the LGB, but it's hard when instead of being educated on what it actually means to be transgender, I'm being put down because I do not understand. I'm afraid that the transgender community is going to become resentful the way a chunk of feminism has become."

So they are charged with good intention but lack the clarity of life and so often are a bit overzealous and end up being bullies.

ainbow,3cjidm,live_wire_,28,Wed Jul 8 22:48:36 2015 UTC,"I do think it's important to make a point about drag queens.  The t word's history as a term of endearment was always reclamation, it was always used as a slur against transgender and transvestites alike (I think partially because the larger world did not recognize a difference) and it's adoption among the drag community was an attempt to reclaim the world.  And now much later the world becomes almost exclusively used as a slur towards transgender people, many of those who initially reclaimed the world feel understandable whiplash and indignation especially since the word still remains an anti-transvestite slur among the older generation because they still use the word transvestite.  So defensiveness towards the word is understandable among older drag queens even if they're wrong and should be a cause for dialogue as opposed to harsh recrimination.   Beyond that Sylvia Rivera was a gay drag performer as I understand it, as were I believe most of the other names there, though Sylvia Rivera certainly was a transgender issues activist. There seem to be other factual issues as well.  But ultimately, this is important because while officially the community is very supportive of trans issues, in terms of advocacy and interpersonal relations we do have a trans problem and we need to work this out."
ainbow,3cjidm,AdumbroDeus,3,Wed Jul 8 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"I think if you look at Rivera's life and how she actually lived and thought of herself, it's clear she was not simply a drag performer, i.e. she presented and lived as a woman 24/7 and did take hormones.

ainbow,3cjidm,JustZisGuy,4,Wed Jul 8 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say because we live in such a male-dominated culture, lesbians are seen as more favorable than gays. Because lesbian sex is hot and gay sex is icky."
ainbow,3cjidm,Shill_Nye,5,Thu Jul 9 00:20:19 2015 UTC,"You'd assume that based on the language used, but when you look at things like media portrayals and the various spokespeople for the community, there's definitely a bit more inclusion for lesbian people than gay people, though that's more between communities than within."
ainbow,3cjidm,Steve_the_Scout,3,Wed Jul 8 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's true for today, although I'd need to see some data before being convinced. I'd be hard pressed to believe it's true if you look at the community historically."
ainbow,3cjidm,JustZisGuy,8,Wed Jul 8 22:50:57 2015 UTC,Well there's a reason why homophobes predominately use gay men as targets or strawmen. Because society views two men together as much more disgusting than women.
ainbow,3cjidm,Shill_Nye,10,Thu Jul 9 00:21:52 2015 UTC,"The flip side of that, however, is that gay men have a greater degree of mindshare. Aside from that, it's not just homophobia that leads to the ""two women is fine, two men is gross"" mindset. Gender roles play into that as well, with the focus on masculinity as inherently opposed to emotion, sentimentality, romance, etc. Straight women are ""allowed"" to engage in more physically (and emotionally) intimate expressions of friendship than straight men are. The implication isn't always that it's ""gay"" for men to be emotional, but that's it's not ""manly""."
ainbow,3cjidm,JustZisGuy,3,Thu Jul 9 00:25:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. So much this.  This is my biggest problem when people use ""male privilege"" to bash gay men, because really if you're gay you don't get too much of that privilege. Privileges don't stack, they intermingle, they affect each other. This is also why black men have a lot of disadvantages compared to black women.   Also I firmly believe that homophobia is just an extension of of misogyny. Which baffles me so much when straight (mainly 2nd wave) feminists bash gay men or even gay women. You can't be homophobic and non-misogynist. Same thing goes with transphobia, it's also connected to homophobia, which confuses me when some LGB people can be so exclusionary.  I think it's really important that women should pay more attention to gay issues, and for gay people to trans issues."
ainbow,3cjidm,Shill_Nye,10,Thu Jul 9 01:47:12 2015 UTC,"some want to divorce the T entirely.  so many times i've wished for a downvote button on the comment sections for queerty / towleroad articles, because of shit like ""it should just be lgb"" and that ilk. seems like it happens on every article that touches a subject having to do with trans issues, and god help you if you read the comments on any caitlyn jenner article. it's like, is this person serious??, trolling??, a poe?, etc.."
ainbow,3cjidm,bry4n,3,Wed Jul 8 18:38:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, as a trans person, I've had that conversation before. I both do and don't think T should be included."

ainbow,3cjidm,bry4n,2,Thu Jul 9 00:24:43 2015 UTC,"Do include because everyone ""different"" should stick together. We should be helping each other break barriers rather than trying to each dismantle our specific barriers.   Don't include because they aren't the same. Being trans is like buying a pair of stilettos when you were given flip flops. Being LGB+ is like wearing Gucci  instead of Armani.

It's not like that for all of us. Hell, it's not like that for a LOT of us.   I grew up trans in a southeast asian family. I didn't fit in with the boys. I didn't fit in with the girls. I got the worst of the ""if you're really a girl you need to know how to cook"" coupled with the ""well you're not really a girl anyway"". I'm not the only one.  Growing up was tough.

I fucking hate how more radical LGB and especially T people (and even straight ppl) love to use the idea of privilege to punch people down. Like no, that's not the point.  You don't fucking try to erase the struggles of trans people by saying ""you had cis privilege before you came out"", or queer men by saying ""you still have male privilege"", or bisexuals with ""well you benefit from straight cis privilege most of the time""... Like fuck no. You don't take someone's experiences AND THEN SHAME THEM that they don't reinforce YOUR ideals of what is or isn't worthy enough for your pity.  The idea of privilege is supposed to EDUCATE and IMPROVE people's well-beings, NOT to dismiss or deny. And it's fucking disgusting that more times than not, that's what social justice peeps here on Reddit too. People here get so fucking finnicky about structures or intersectional relativity and the bullshit academic details, rather than taking two seconds to look up and see WHAT'S ACTUALLY happening. Like, whenever I hear news about some gay guy getting bashed and commenters rushing into say ""lGbt amirite?!! Lelele"" or all the ""Leelah Alcorn had white privilege!"" comments it makes we want to pick out my brain with a rusty syringe through my ears.   Like privilege isn't like a fucking character ability in Skyrim, as much as Redditors think it is. There's no numeric value in privilege, despite the STEMjerk here trying to formalize it. And that's what sucks balls so hard with this discussion, people try to think their amount of privilege makes them superior to others. When really the thing is, it's not a constant number, it's not even a constant anything. Either you have it in a current moment or you don't. Because nobody being bashed or harassed or raped or shamed or whatever for their identity NEVER thinks ""well, I should just deal with it because I could have it worse.""  Privilege needs to be a CONstructive discussion that's opened to ideas, not a DEstructive one bent on ego inflating and circlejerking. And that's what bothers me so much about online activism: people are so much quicker to open their mouths and say something judgmental than listen and read.  And that's what it should be about -- we need to listen and focus on other people's experiences rather than immediately stamp the person on the forehead with ""privilege"" or whatever else to silence them. Because despite how different our identities are, everyone's still a person in the end and nobody has a right to tell you otherwise. /rant"

All the biphobia I've ever gotten have been from self-righteous (usually cis lesbians or trans women) who think that because they're queerer than us, they deserve all the pity and attention.   And that's why I think heterophobia is a completely real thing: queers aren't biphobic because we're non-momosexual, it's because we're seen as closer to straight (hissss)."

ainbow,3cjidm,sun_wyvern,25,Thu Jul 9 09:00:13 2015 UTC,"If this article was supposed to highlight the ways the trans community is mistreated within the LGBT community, it failed.  If anything it's a case study in how the word ""transphobic"" is thrown around too lightly.  In every subsection of the article, the author successfully identifies in ways the LGBT community is trying to include the transgender community, but the author attempts to disqualify it as ""not counting"" for reasons X, Y, or Z.  The first subsection includes counting the number of trans celebrities celebrated at Pride (2) and determining that's not enough compared to LGB celebrities.  That's not mistreatment.  It's, at best, identifying that not as many trans individuals have made it to the same nationally recognized celebrity level.  The second subject is an attempt to indict the HRC not for mistreating the Trans community, just ""not being as nice"" to them as the same-sex marriage movement.  The article fully admits that HRC honored Lana Wachowski and helped other trans figures but flagged them as if they ""don't count"" or are ""not enough.""  That's not mistreatment or transphobia.  The third subsection tries to equate the AIDS crisis and President Reagan refusing to say the word ""gay"" to how the LGBT community fails to identify the higher suicide and victimization rate of trans individuals.  The author treats Dan Savage's inclusion of ""transgender friends"" as ""a footnote"" and doesn't think it holds weight.  He made a point to be inclusive in his quote on NPR and yet it ""didn't count"".  The fourth subsection is the only one that might to hold up to scrutiny.  Here you have the clash between the drag community that uses the words ""tranny"" and ""she-male"" as terms of empowerment (or humor) and the transgender community who often have those words used against them often when they're being assaulted.  We see the author blaming the drag community and RuPaul for using, and defending their use, of the word because of other people's misuse.  The author even says RuPaul is transphobic for the defense.  To use the author's own comparison, the n-word in the black community similarly falls down to intent.  What the trans community sees, according to the author, is a callous drag community that is snubbing its nose at transgender individuals who are victimized.  What the drag community sees is a word-police that can't tell the difference between a word being used to joke around with their smoke & mirrors cross-dressing performance and word being used to assault.  Who is to say either side is right or wrong?  Do we want to get out the history books and argue over who used it the longest?  Even if you wanted to go down this rabbit hole, it's worth noting that RuPaul's show discontinued its use of this language.  So why still use this as an argument for transphobia?  If anything it's an example of a victory for transgender individuals educating others.  The transgender community is often not treated respectfully.  You see it based on the questions they are asked in interviews, or how there's still legislation against them using the right bathrooms, or how it's harder for them to get proper health coverage for their unique biological situations.  THOSE are transphobic situations.  When you're argument turns into ""we're not being treated special enough"" then I stop listening.  If anything this article successfully shows how liberally the transgender community throws around the attack that something is transphobic.  Hell, I'll likely be called transphobic by the end of the day because I think this article didn't make its point very well."

The second subject is an attempt to indict the HRC not for mistreating the Trans community   They threw the Trans community under the bus so that the L+G community could get protections in ENDA. How exactly is that not mistreating them?   The third subsection tries to equate the AIDS crisis   You mean in the way that people ignore the insane number of deaths?

The author treats Dan Savage's inclusion of ""transgender friends"" as ""a footnote"" and doesn't think it holds weight. He made a point to be inclusive in his quote on NPR and yet it ""didn't count"".   Do you know why? Because what he said doesn't match what Trans people experience! It's no different to someone saying ""I have Gay friends!"" to justify the crap they come out with.  Yeah, I'm not sure I'd accept that shit from someone talking about G+L, but we're supposed to accept it when it's about Trans.   The fourth subsection is the only one that might to hold up to scrutiny.

How did that go down when straight people suggested that...? Yeah, real well. (have you spotted something yet? The very arguments used against G+L people are being used against Trans people... by G+L people! Don't think we're too stupid to spot it...)

No, I'll call you Transphobic for what you're doing... trying to dismiss very real concerns using the very same arguments that G+L people suffered under for decades.

If you use it on me for my reddit post, and you equally use it on the folks that actively attack or assault transgender individuals, and you equally use it on the legislators writing laws against transgender individuals, then you equate the three.  They are not the same.  It's a hard lesson the gay community had to learn with the word ""homophobic"".  The Atlantic had a great article about the Freedom To Marry's contribution to the same-sex marriage fight not too long ago.  One of the things they learned in focus groups and other research is ""the message matters"" and you need something that resonates.  Sometimes that takes a careful, sanitized approach.  (Edit: including the notable link and quotation)    There was stiff resistance within the movement to the new approach. Some thought it made no sense or wasn’t aggressive enough; some resented the strictly vetted, disciplined, sanitized faces the movement was putting forth. But in 2012, after 31 straight losses for gay marriage at the ballot box, Freedom to Marry spearheaded a centralized, politically savvy, message-tested campaign in four states—Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington. On Election Day, the gay-marriage side won in all four states. “Four for four after 0 for 31—that’s a big change,” Erickson Hatalsky said. “People started to understand that this really works.” It was bracing to realize how long they’d gotten it wrong—but cathartic to see that people could empathize with gay people’s emotional desires.

So why the living fuck are you doing it to a group you freely admit is still getting shit on??   You're making your umbrella smaller.   You've just pushed Trans people out from under the umbrella... again. Add on you blaming the Trans people for being pushed out, and you'll begin to see just why you personally are actively doing harm. (really... you are justifying excluding Trans people... if you don't see how that does harm, there's no helping you)  :edit: Good to know you think that all the times any group pushed out their token gay member was actually a good thing rather than an attempt at PR... I guess all those times people were offended by it and complained about it was really just them complaining about not being treated special enough.  I don't know which is worse... that you use the very same arguments that were used to dismiss/exclude/ignore L+G people for decades, or that you are actively defending the very same actions that L+G people fought against. I guess once a group gets it's rights, it just shits on those lower down the ladder in the same way they got shit on before.  :edit2: Sucks when your hypocrisy gets pointed out to you, doesn't it...?

The rest of his comments following his main point talk about how it wasn't so bad that legislation that passed simply dismissed transgender people but that's another point I disagree with as well.

We throw the word transphobia around willy-nilly to people like me who just want us to put our best arguments forward instead of saving it for folks that actively campaign against us.  I said I understood why HRC would try to take that deal the congressional committee offered 8 years ago.  I also then praised them in 2013 for getting a trans-inclusive measure passed in the Senate.  And I encouraged folks who hate the HRC for their actions in 2007 to not act like 2013 didn't happen.  For what it's worth, since this entire comment tree is about what I do or don't think, I am glad that the non-inclusive one failed.  If it had passed, we'd never see trans-inclusivity for decades.  Any attempt to pass it and congress will turn around and say ""we just did"" as if trans were invisible.  Yes it means the LGB folks have to wait longer, but it's a wait worth having."

I encouraged folks who hate the HRC for their actions in 2007 to not act like 2013 didn't happen.   Perhaps you might consider encouraging folks who praise HRC for their actions in 2013 to not act like 2007 never happened?  And perhaps you might consider that it's not the fact they supported non-inclusive ENDA that is the real problem... it's the fact they very publicly stated they would NOT support any non-inclusive legislation AT ALL, then went ahead and did so anyway... then insisted that they ""misspoke"", that they would support non-inclusive legislation after all.  Funny how they didn't make that clear until after they'd taken the money from the fundraiser... money donated by Trans people on that occasion.

You seem to think that pushing out a token member of a group is not offensive or harmful in any way...  You state that pointing out the shit that is being done and saying it is wrong... is complaining about not being treated special enough.  At what point is any of that not accurate?   We push more and more people out of the umbrella   AND TRANS PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU TO FUCKING STOP!  But it's the Trans people's fault... just like it was the fault of the L+G people that they were excluded from so much for so long.   then cry that we don't have the support we need.   How many more examples of Trans people being excluded from that support do you need before you admit that they have not been given the support that we keep claiming they get?

Good to know that someone outside the group knows better than the group itself what their lives are like... but he has Trans friends, so that's ok. Right?  Oh, and would you like to show how I've used him as a strawman?

I would like an answer to that, an answer that is more than just ""they're complaining that they're not being treated special enough"" since that very same shit was used against LGB people when they complained about tokenism!   this is completely irrelevant and pointless to the current discussion and really identifies your problem in the current discussion as well.    And yet all the reasons for why it was badly written were wrong... and the only way to deny that is to dismiss the very real concerns and issues facing Trans people.   yet again it is really obvious that you aren't reading what is being written. Someone said ""i disagree...."" and you went off like a rocket, you didn't take the time to critically read what they wrote, you read the beginnings of dissent and off you went."

So, tokenism... even though that is the point that the article made about just how few Trans people are included by groups like HRC, is somehow irrelevant to the response that ""not enough are being included""?  Yeah... you simply dismissed it and moved on... I guess it was only bad when it was LGB people who were token members of anything, but Trans people should be happy with it?   Except neither OP nor myself have said or feel anything negative against the trans* community so you're trying to fight shadows atm.   Trans people are just complaining they aren't being treated special enough, right? That's certainly not negative at all...  The fact you don't see what you're saying, nor the way it's the same ""sit down and stop demanding special treatment"" shit that got thrown at LGB people over the decades is pretty nasty...

I'm also ""actively doing harm"" to people and am the equivalent to the American Family Association in my rhetoric.  These were hard lessons the same-sex marriage movement learned too.  There may be one hundred different arguments you could make but they are not equally as strong and it's not homophobic (or transphobic) for someone to say the one you're using could be stronger.  The Atlantic's article I referenced yesterday still rings true with my point.   There was stiff resistance within the movement to the new approach. Some thought it made no sense or wasn’t aggressive enough; some resented the strictly vetted, disciplined, sanitized faces the movement was putting forth. But in 2012, after 31 straight losses for gay marriage at the ballot box, Freedom to Marry spearheaded a centralized, politically savvy, message-tested campaign in four states—Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington. On Election Day, the gay-marriage side won in all four states. “Four for four after 0 for 31—that’s a big change,” Erickson Hatalsky said."
ainbow,3cjidm,throwingred,4,Thu Jul 9 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Whenever I hear these criticisms of the HRC, I think of the story of Claudette Colvin, the first black person to be arrested for refusing to give up her seat for a white person during the civil rights movement. The NAACP tried to hide her story because she was young, pregnant, and unmarried. Rosa Parks was arrested and glorified 9 months later because the public could much easier feel pity for a tired old woman.    In the gay rights movement, being trans is the new ""pregnant and unmarried."" By putting gay rights over trans rights, the HRC isn't being transphobic, they're being strategic."
ainbow,3cjidm,BabiesTasteLikeBacon,17,Wed Jul 8 17:45:27 2015 UTC,That's all fine and good till HRC supported an ENDA that didn't include trans people. Their reasoning was that they wouldn't be able to pass it with trans inclusion. They finally got around to in in 2013 like the article said. That's the thing though why shouldn't trans people get upset when something on that level happens. Trans unemployment is much higher than LG or B unemployment. The one group that will get the most usage out of that was initially left out.

How can a person even think about marriage if they don't have secure employment or housing?  The HRC follows the will of the big doners: wealthy lesbian and gay couples looking to dodge estate taxes and the like.  Now that we've emerged victorious on this front, and it was still an important issue for the people, perhaps we'll have funds to dedicate to fighting housing and employment discrimination.

Thats why they fought so hard for the right to marry their loved ones.

While it's tempting to make arguments about resisting heteronormativity or outright assimilation, I have to acknowledge the importance of fighting for equality under the law.  Marriage is something the movement had to address, and our victory is certainly worth celebrating.  I just think we should have prioritized other things.  While we've made some concrete gains for well-off people living in liberal areas the SCOTUS decision does not protect us from being fired or evicted.  Something like half of our population is living somewhere where their employer or landlord could kick them to the curb for getting legally married to the person they love. ""Hospital visitation, adoption rights, inheritance rights, military benefits, healthcare benefits"", and even the purported dignity of marriage are all irrelevant in our society if you're homeless, unemployed, or dead.  I don't want to criticize people who've fought for this undeniably righteous cause - I was one of them after all - but we have a hell of a lot of work to do if we want anything remotely resembling equality."

ainbow,3cjidm,shaedofblue,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"History has shown that winning rights based on marriage is a key step to expanding similar freedoms for all people, married or unmarried.  Less than 100 years ago, it was illegal to advertise or use contraceptive devices in the United States. In 1965, the Supreme Court decided that since decisions over procreation were subject to a right of marital privacy, such laws were unconstitutional. Recognizing this right later led the Court, in 1972, to decide that the right to use contraceptives was protected for all couples, not just married couples. So the decision based on married couples was a key step in gaining rights for all couples.  That's likely what we'll see when it comes to same-sex marriage. Many federal anti-discrimination laws already protect people from discrimination based on marital status, which means those laws can also be used to protect against discrimination due to someone's same-sex marriage. Once that right is provided, it becomes harder for courts to protect the right solely for married same-sex couples, and I predict that in relatively short order, courts will start recognizing that all LGBT people should receive similar protections."

That isn't necessarily transphobic (at least in many instances, though there are LGBT people and activists who are transphobic), but it is exclusionary to trans* people. This includes things like making LGBT rights seem like they're focused on marriage, leading to it seeming like the fight is over because gay marriage is legalised. For many trans* people, marriage isn't even close to the issue when they're being killed and dying of suicide in unprecedented numbers. There's been progress made on trans* issues, yes, but the gay rights movement as a whole has sidelined trans* issues in favour of being more marketable and presenting a particular lifestyle as representative of all LGBT individuals when it's really not."
ainbow,3cjidm,Alec-Baldwins-Nut,11,Wed Jul 8 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"You may not have met the people who say it isn't over - I have.

It's not over, not by a long shot, but that doesn't mean that the public at large doesn't think that it's over.   But the point I'm making is that the gay rights movement, with the things it chooses to focus its efforts on, is inherently discriminatory not only towards trans*, but to any people who don't conform to the particular image of LGBT that it presents. When so much work has to be done just to make homosexuality seem non-deviant, things that don't conform that ""acceptable"" image of sexuality are seen as further and intolerably deviant. I'd argue that in some ways, the popularisation of the gay rights movement has made life harder for trans people specifically because of what it chooses to focus on. That's my point here."

But the Trans community was not the secret starter of Stonewall and then erased. Nor was it the Lesbian community that did it all to have the gay men come along and steal the thunder.  Those are absolute myths.  Edit to correct-I became distracted while typing and jumped two areas."
ainbow,3cjidm,lordtyp0,19,Wed Jul 8 21:15:51 2015 UTC,"It's further complicated by the fact that a lot of people in the drag community back then came to identify as trans and transition later, once there was support and knowledge about it."
ainbow,3cjidm,Cass_Griffin,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:22:50 2015 UTC,I am not sure about the veracity of that statement. Certainly possible-but I've not seen or read anything that tracked those individuals.

ainbow,3cjidm,Shill_Nye,-1,Wed Jul 8 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"The topic of the thread (single example) shows the statement ""Many drag performers transitioned""? Seems a stretch :P  My stance is just what can be verified via historical facts. Evidence, interviews etc. etc.  I am dubious about the idea that the drag performers were Trans in significant numbers based mainly on the drag queens I personally know (flawed I know). If someone has info that follows people who were involved (not just the famous ones), I am definitely interested."
ainbow,3cjidm,Granny_Weatherwax,7,Wed Jul 8 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"It's more a ""words change"" argument than a strict definitional one. Sylvia Rivera, as a famous example, called herself a drag queen, and more often I think, a 'transvestite', but through-out the last half of her life identified clearly and notably as a trans woman. The phrase ""trans woman"" didn't exist in 1969.  And consequently, our 2015 definition of drag queen has a different connotation today."
ainbow,3cjidm,Farteddddddddddddddd,-2,Wed Jul 8 17:01:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure I entirely agree, though could just different stress points-Drag was always an exaggeration. Sort of a caricature of a woman. Drag performances were always as we define drag queens today-though there were many that focused on the more burlesque that focused on shock revelation.  Even Ms. Rivera in biography goes into being taken in by drag performers. I think it is likely that many of the trans community did drag as a source of money-but I've never seen accounts of it. Not sure of any sources.  The first recognized transition in the west was Christine Jorgenson who began transition in I think '51 or '52. Transgender as a concept was certainly around before the riots- of course, that doesn't mean police recognized anything as such. They always marked as ""Transvestite"" which though means more crossdresser, had more of a fetish inflection at the time.  But-the caricature Drag Queen and Drag King was also definitely around at the time.  Has some pics that are relevent: http://www.polarimagazine.com/tag/before-stonewall/   Am I saying all those in Drag were performers? ABSOLUTELY NOT. I don't think there is any data that has survived in that regards to separate the demographics. Not that it really matters.  I am saying in regards to this is we have to be careful how we interpret the past through the lens of today. At that time many groups that we now delineate were lumped into one.  Much like how say: Wikipedia attributes the riots to (quote taken from Carters Stonewall book) 'street kids, the most outcast of the outcast'. Todays lens would probably interpret that as something very different than: Homeless, probably under 19, and Out.  At that time everyone was extremely closeted. There were hookup places that were the outlets-the Stonewall Inn was one of them. The street kids would act as call boys to them-but people would not associate because they were Out. People who were Out were a danger to those in the closet, even at clubs and bars.  I think it is far to say that in that era, Transgender people were exceptionally rare. There was no communication. No support. With that in mind its easy to see them performing drag-but I don't think there is evidence or grounds to proclaim that most the drag queens were in fact trans."
ainbow,3cjidm,Shill_Nye,4,Wed Jul 8 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"The difficulty in verifying it is that it was a complicated web of people, almost none of whom used their legal names (for various reasons). The era didn't differentiate well between the two. It wasn't until the late seventies that the topic of ""transsexualism"" re-entered the American mind, and suddenly a lot of these people who called their life-style ""drag"" suddenly came to see there was a life outside of that.   They almost certainly didn't make up a majority, but they did exist.  That all said, tracking anyone from Stonewall nowadays is difficult. A lot of folks spread out, a lot of people died (AIDS, old age), a lot never used their legal names, or hid it from their families. I'd wager a few are in the closet pretending to be straight."

And since we’re still seeing people seroconvert, we must conclude that “condoms only” has reached its peak efficacy as a mass prevention effort.   Uh no.  That is not a valid conclusion.  A more realistic conclusion is that people aren't using condoms despite the danger and further advocacy and availability is warranted.  Even in spite of conservative efforts to the contrary.   There are people who usually use condoms but sometimes don’t; there are people who never use condoms; and there are people who try their best to use condoms but often do not. We need to talk about HIV prevention that works for those people, because it’s those people who are seroconverting.   What ""works"" for them?  This isn't some kind of preference like saying ""oh, the Atkins diet doesn't really work for me.""  It's putting a rubber on your dick to prevent the transmission of a deadly disease.

But what I DO need is just advice on how to come out.   My advice is, worry about yourself first. Coming out is not as important as, and much easier when, you're mentally healthy. It seems (to me anyway) that coming out is only really a tangential issue, and that the main issue is your mental well-being.  Seeing a therapist is good. If you're anything like me (and you are, considering we're both gay 20-something CS students with depression/anxiety), then asking your therapist for some books on dealing with mental illness may be useful. The most useful thing I read about was on thinking-about-thinking; being able to notice your own thoughts that are depression or anxiety loops that just fill your head with noise. Breaking those loops takes practice, but it's doable.  Another interesting thing I've read was Spoon Theory ( http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/ ), which is a useful metaphor for living life with illness (it's lupus in the story, but it applies just the same). Managing your resources is important.  Anyway, my main points are (pretty cheesily, I admit): help yourself before worrying about coming out so much, and knowledge is power."

ainbow,3cgtx9,BovusSanctus,20,Tue Jul 7 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon for religious schools to ban students from having sex even off campus. And yeah, if you break their student code of conduct it is possible you could be expelled. I'd assume the punishment would be much less drastic though.  A big religious university near me still bans ""homosexual acts"" and any sexual conduct in general. I can't imagine attending a school like that."
ainbow,3cgtx9,RedditUser145,8,Wed Jul 8 02:07:48 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking that. LDS universities' code of conduct dictates length of haircuts and dresses, for God's sake. Restricting sexual activity is tame af when compared to that."
ainbow,3cgtx9,Kittenclysm,10,Wed Jul 8 04:52:03 2015 UTC,"Baylor student here! Yes, it does mean that premarital/extramarital sex (with anyone of any gender, now!) is technically against the code of conduct. The university doesn't expel students for it unless it is a scandal of some sort that gains media attention, or if a woman happens to get pregnant and she isn't married. Baylor has been known to ""ask them to leave"" which means pressuring them to withdraw or transfer or face expulsion. It's really quite awful, because it creates a hostile environment for victims of sexual assault and unfairly punishes women for doing something that most twenty-somethings are doing."
ainbow,3cgtx9,loveswell,3,Wed Jul 8 05:00:25 2015 UTC,"Can I ask (in a non-critical, non-judgemental way) why you go there if that's what their policies are?"
ainbow,3cgtx9,OptimalCynic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:34:50 2015 UTC,They offered me a huge scholarship and my parents basically forced me to go. I'm in the (unofficial and under-the-table of course) LGBT and atheist clubs here. There are a few of us!
ainbow,3cgtx9,loveswell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:20:45 2015 UTC,"About what I thought. I've got a friend struggling with the same dilemma at the moment. It's an awful lot of money to throw away on the altar of principle. I can't criticise your decision, but I have to say I'm glad I didn't have to make it myself."
ainbow,3cgtx9,OptimalCynic,3,Wed Jul 8 23:26:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm genuinely amazed. Baylor University basically reserves the right to slutshame, if I understand things correctly."
ainbow,3cgtx9,BovusSanctus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:50 2015 UTC,"Yep. They also make it very very difficult for victims of sexual assault or abuse to find personal help or healing, let alone legal."

ainbow,3cgtx9,Epistaxis,6,Wed Jul 8 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"I think it is small progress that deserves an eye rolling sigh and a ""well, it's something."" But it's sad that a university, officially qualified to hand out degrees, has such puritan ""conduct policies"" at all. Well, I guess it's a private school, technically nobody is forced to go there, but this puritan nonsense is still so idiotic, so contrary to human nature, and such a testament to Christianity's perverted ideas about sexuality and the enjoyment of life in general.  Edit: I'm not too happy with how I phrased that first sentence, in case that's why I'm getting downvoted. I stand by the rest. I think Christian sexual morality is rotten to the core, and that being an education provider does not entitle a school to interfere with the consensual and legal sex lives of the students. I find the former prohibition of dancing especially telling of the underlying attitudes."

Baylor's old policy called ""homosexual acts"" a misuse of ""God's gift,""   What gift is this?
