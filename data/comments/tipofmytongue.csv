Contract bridge is the most common form of bridge, and it isn't quite the same; you ""communicate"" with your bids, like if you bid ""One heart"" it means you have a strong 5-card heart suit and a few other good face cards, and if your partner comes back with ""Three hearts"" it mean she also has kickass heart support.  There are other forms of bridge that I know very little about, but this could easily be one of them."
