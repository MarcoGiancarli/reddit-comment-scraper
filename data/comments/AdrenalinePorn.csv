AdrenalinePorn,3d8zjx,Jrodicon,5,Tue Jul 14 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"see the cornice on the sunny side, that gets bigger, and the last thing you want in big mountains like these is to be under a big cornice.

AdrenalinePorn,3d8zjx,sraperez,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:36 2015 UTC,Oh I see. So then the fear is that the cornice might collapse? Can you explain a bit more? Thanks.
AdrenalinePorn,3d8zjx,Jrodicon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, cornices collapse fairly often in big mountains like that and tend to trigger large avalanches. These types of mountains usually have large glaciers below nearly all large snow covered faces as well as bergschrunds (large cracks in the snow/ice at the bottom of a steep face that marks the start of the glacier). Even if you survive a multi-thousand foot fall over rock and ice down a face, you will likely end up in a crevasse (very bad situation). People do sometimes get rescued from crevasses but if you get buried in a crevasse by the snow from an avalanche, there is little chance of survival. Check out this video: https://youtu.be/_d43_ruHiI0?t=3m1s first they blast 1 cornice, then just the wind and noise from the helicopter sets off another and around 4:00 you can see the snow filling a large crevasse (I recommend watching from 3:00 to the end of the video). These things fall naturally all the time even without a trigger. Even without the danger of crevasses, avalanches alone can easily bury anyone caught, and contrary to popular belief, you can't dig yourself out from an avalanche. The snow basically turns to chunks of ice and if people don't find you and dig you out within 20 minutes, you'll suffocate. There are tons of hazards associated with cornices so it is very important to avoid the danger at all costs. Finally: the slopes under cornices are usually steeper then the other side of the mountain, this picture is tilted (look at the horizon) and so it looks like they are walking on the steeper side of the mountain when they really aren't."
AdrenalinePorn,3d8zjx,sraperez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for all the information. I know nothing of mountaineering but it's something I have always wanted to do. So far I just boulder and climb straight up mountains if I can, deviating from the worn path to make it interesting. Ice...snow...? That makes things quite difficult, and I've never climbed more than a thousand feet in elevation when I'm making my own trails. Thanks for the share, now I feel like I know something, haha."
AdrenalinePorn,3d8zjx,Jrodicon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:59:15 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. I'd someday like to be a true mountaineer as well. I was lucky enough to grow up in the rockies so I've had access to some decent sized mountains my whole life, though we don't have any glaciers. I hike and ski a lot, climb peaks, and have a bit of snow climbing experience. I'm hoping to get myself educated by taking mountaineering and avalanche courses in the next couple years and have dreams to climb in Alaska and the Himalayas in the next 10-15 years."

That kind of blatant disregard for your own life is a sign of some deeply rooted mental issues. I'm all for doing totally rad stuff (wingsuit flying, great!), but this is reckless to the absolute extent of the definition. I hope he doesn't have a family. This is the first real ""stunt on video"" that I've ever had this reaction to, and I honestly didn't think I'd see the day. This isn't about an adrenaline rush, it's about watching some guy roll the dice at trying not to die. All for the sake of making a sweet Youtube video that will get lots of hits... He's a bad influence and I really can't respect it.   I wrote this for the conversation, so if you want to upvote/downvote I'd also like to hear your honest thoughts (anybody)."
AdrenalinePorn,3bra3x,CFRAmustang,6,Thu Jul 2 05:54:31 2015 UTC,"totally agree i think adrenaline porn is about doing crazy shit that seems completely reckless but isnt really if you take the right safety precautions, rock climbing, skydiving, highlining, windsurfing, cliff jumping etc, all shit that seems crazy unsafe but is actually kinda hard to injure yourself doing let alone die from especially if youre safe about it. This is not like that, this is someone not giving a shit about their life for a cool vid."

AdrenalinePorn,3bra3x,audiostatic82,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:39 2015 UTC,I think that many people getting into a cutting-edge sport like alpine wingsuiting do so without a plan to retire from it.

AdrenalinePorn,3bk62s,whirlin_dervish,12,Mon Jun 29 23:43:20 2015 UTC,I was there last week. Its pretty shallow and I wouldn't recommend jumping from where this pic was taken unless you really know what you're doing. This jump was around 55 ft but the main one is around 25. The pool is probably 12 ft deep at its deepest and gets very shallow once you deviate from the middle.
AdrenalinePorn,3bk62s,lessthanjake,2,Tue Jun 30 01:31:55 2015 UTC,"I saw this picture and thought, ""You know, I would probably actually do this."" Then I saw your comment and got very anxious. I think I'd stick to the 25."

AdrenalinePorn,3bk62s,doubledip10,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:44:41 2015 UTC,I was down there last summer and just hopping off the other side.  How high up was that one?  And was it deep enough?  I was hitting bottom off the little guys on the other side.
AdrenalinePorn,3bk62s,no_social_skills,2,Tue Jun 30 07:43:52 2015 UTC,I didn't measure but it looked to be around 55 or 60 ft. I was also hitting the bottom when jumping from the other side (probs from about 25ft) so I didn't go for the big jump. People were doing it but I figured I'd rather not risk it.

AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,YackiSmaCK,45,Mon Jun 22 20:52:55 2015 UTC,"slack lining. This is actually super fun, and just about anyone who is reasonably fit can learn to do it. They sell kits or you can put one together on your own for pretty cheap. Fun activity for cookouts at the park and stuff like that."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Your_Gonna_Hate_This,36,Mon Jun 22 21:34:13 2015 UTC,When it's between a canyon/ buildings/ hot air balloons (it's been done) etc. it's called highlining and there are far more safety precautions in highlining than there are in slacklining
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,salmonnerd,4,Mon Jun 22 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a good point, but I'm curious how much the actual execution changes.  I guess it might be a lot windier, but is the technique different to highline, or is it just scarier/more in need of safety work?"
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Bartweiss,6,Tue Jun 23 01:04:36 2015 UTC,"The rigging is much more in depth for a highline...youll need the line itself, the anchors, a backup line taped to the line you walk on, and backup anchors(if you want to be 100% safe).  In terms of walking it....its a whole different sport in my opinion.  I can walk a 90 foot slackline pretty easily, but when your 30, or 300, or a 1000 feet in the air your mind plays tricks on you.  It becomes more of a mental game than a physical one."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,skithehoop,3,Tue Jun 23 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if you can block the mental barriers of height, it is exactly the same as longlining on the ground. Rock climbing got rid of my fear of heights, especially with a harness, so I found the transition pretty easy.  That being said, it is still a completely exhilarating feeling of floating in the air like that."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Zimbobwei,3,Tue Jun 23 03:56:28 2015 UTC,"True, but for me I dont rock climb, im just going straight from learning to slackline, to longline, to highline...so for me its incredibly difficult from a mental standpoint.  Ive only highlined a couple times though so itll improve."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,skithehoop,2,Tue Jun 23 04:33:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. That's sort of the whole point of highlining: walking it is really no different than a longline on the ground, so why is it so much more difficult?  The physical act of slacklining is not that hard to learn, but the mental barriers involved in walking so high are incredible, and difficult to overcome. You're fighting 2 million years of evolution telling you not to step on that line and walk out there."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Bigfrostynugs,2,Tue Jun 23 16:54:11 2015 UTC,Wind speeds climb fairly rapidly with elevation.  /Source: I build highrises.
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,irishjihad,4,Tue Jun 23 19:24:17 2015 UTC,"Both actually, I've done it a few times myself. When you're slacklining between trees, you just anchor it around the trees with simple carabiners. When you're highlining, you need bolts in a rock, much heavier anchoring equipment, locking carabiners, multiple backup rigs, and getting over the fear of being on a 1 inch line over hundreds of feet in the air is really hard."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,salmonnerd,4,Tue Jun 23 14:44:47 2015 UTC,"I know, but it's the same activity. And the only extra precaution is a harness with a tether to the line."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Your_Gonna_Hate_This,3,Tue Jun 23 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"And different rigging on the line (need more tension, which stresses the line more), and possibly wider/thicker webbing"
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Quteness,2,Tue Jun 23 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"Huh, didn't know that. I figured they used more gear for the longer line, but I don't know the specifics."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Your_Gonna_Hate_This,3,Tue Jun 23 03:18:35 2015 UTC,"No it's not. Highlining is much harder, both physically and mentally. When highlining, you need bolts in a rock, much heavier anchoring equipment, locking carabiners, and multiple backup systems."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,salmonnerd,2,Tue Jun 23 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"You can say that all you want but being that high completely changes it. Yes, it's the same line, but walking it over a 3000 foot drop is much, much more difficult than on the ground, regardless of what it seems like it should be."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Bigfrostynugs,3,Tue Jun 23 16:56:09 2015 UTC,"I built mine out of climbing webbing (one large purchased piece and several smaller ones recovered from climbing).  Total I spent about 20$... Loads of fun, but would not use it for high lining.  edit: I will point out that this setup is not suitable for high lining.  You need a much stronger line for this setup due to the geometry.  Normal webbing is safe for climbing but much more force is generated when you are in the middle of a line that is drawn taut."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,FearTheCron,3,Tue Jun 23 02:53:02 2015 UTC,"Same. If you know how, all you need is webbing, a line locker, and 3 carabiner for anyone out there who may be intersted. There are other ways too of course."

AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,FearTheCron,2,Tue Jun 23 02:53:38 2015 UTC,You need to try it with a handhold. Put up a guide rope above the slackline that you can hold onto while you're balancing. That's how I learned.
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,Bigfrostynugs,2,Tue Jun 23 16:58:36 2015 UTC,So I have that.  When I get to the middle of the rope it is wobbling back and forth and I can't seem to stabilize it.

AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,alliancejetpack,3,Tue Jun 23 17:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it sucks. Dean was an incredible human being and I feel bad for his friends and family, but if you asked him how he would have chosen to go, it likely would have been BASE jumping off El Cap. I think it would have been much more sad if he got hit by a car or something. For those who loved him though, I'm sure that's little consolation.  I'm just glad he didn't die on the high line. We don't need that press in the community.  RIP Dean."

I'm trying to figure out if his goal was to get all the way across or simply get to the middle and grab the drone.  I'd have to think it was the latter given how close that drone was flying to him, it'd be pretty distracting to try to get all the way across with that thing whipping around your head."
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,SQUID_FUCKER,5,Mon Jun 22 21:18:39 2015 UTC,There was a camera on the drone so the point was to grab the drone and record himself falling close-up.

AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,SQUID_FUCKER,10,Mon Jun 22 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"I think what he meant is that there was a 2nd camera specifically to show the drone... to show the man grabbing the drone...

Second, what do they secure it to? Lastly, do you have to get permits to set things up like this in place like Yosemite/wherever he is?"
AdrenalinePorn,3ar4aw,nessefi,5,Tue Jun 23 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"A gap like that would be easiest way to get the webbing across would be with a bow and arrow, tie a string to the arrow, then pull that string back with the webbing attached to it.

Fighter pilots have to train because the direction G is applied in most of the manoeuvres they do is downward, causing a lack of blood in the brain."

AdrenalinePorn,3ajv1a,XTC-FTW,10,Sun Jun 21 14:23:10 2015 UTC,Extreme G Force can knock people out due to improper blood flow.   Fighter pilots have to go through some rather extreme training in order to counteract it. They look absolutely hilarious during their training due to how the G Forces pull at the skin.
AdrenalinePorn,3ajv1a,BrianPurkiss,3,Sun Jun 21 04:51:10 2015 UTC,From my understanding the issue is the force prevents blood from flowing into your brain and you black out from that.  But surely such force for less than a second is easier to cope with than the same force over several minutes.
AdrenalinePorn,3ajv1a,cadika_orade,3,Sun Jun 21 05:05:35 2015 UTC,"It's definitely easier for shorter spans. But if you aren't trained or aren't physically fit enough, a lot of Gs even in a short span can black you out.   In this situation? I don't think the chances are very great."

He sinks into the soft materials on launch as opposed to being on a hard surface. With a hard surface, his brain would be more likely to be shaken around in his skull which could cause him to get knocked out (possibly long enough to not pull his parachute then fall to his death.)"
AdrenalinePorn,3ajv1a,K3R3G3,8,Sun Jun 21 07:37:26 2015 UTC,Yea it would barely reduce the acceleration at all. Plus the feathers aren't even behind his head. I can't tell if you are joking though.

The 102nd floor was originally a landing platform with a dirigible gangplank. A particular elevator, traveling between the 86th and 102nd floors, was supposed to transport passengers after they checked in at the observation deck on the 86th floor. However, the idea proved to be impractical and dangerous after a few attempts with airships, due to the powerful updrafts caused by the size of the building itself. The T-shaped mooring devices remain in place. A large broadcast antenna was added to the top of the spire in 1952.   http://www.nyc-architecture.com/MID/MID073.htm"

AdrenalinePorn,39her6,skier,14,Thu Jun 11 18:59:53 2015 UTC,Why would you have two parachutes out?
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,Time_To_Rebuild,36,Thu Jun 11 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"If you don't pull your main parachute as you pass through 1000 ft, an Automatic Activation Device (AAD) automatically deploys the reserve parachute.  My friend got distracted on this jump and pulled his main parachute too late. By that point, the AAD had already deployed his reserve, so he ended up with two out."
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,pukesickle,67,Thu Jun 11 20:04:25 2015 UTC,Seems like getting distracted while sky diving is not a good thing.
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,ilovefatgirls,21,Thu Jun 11 20:19:39 2015 UTC,Did he mean to land on the roof or was he distracted again?
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,IamMotherDuck,8,Thu Jun 11 21:06:26 2015 UTC,I'm sure after a fuck up like that he was pretty alert for the rest of the ride. you just have much less control with two canopies out.
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,rabel,8,Fri Jun 12 07:03:40 2015 UTC,"If your descent speed is higher than you would be with a good canopy out, the AAD will fire and deploy your reserve. This sometimes happens when people are swooping a high-performance canopy and their descent speed is extremely high even though they are under a perfectly good canopy and (probably) precisely controlling their descent to make a spectacular swoop landing. Having your reserve deploy in this instance will probably kill you since you're probably pretty close to the ground at that point.  Other times, there can be an AAD misfire (rare) or your reserve gets deployed for other reasons such as you pulling the wrong handle (rare) or your reserve static line gets snagged on something, or for whatever reason your main didn't look good to you and you deployed your reserve without cutting away your main first (also rare).  Anyhow, during training you are trained on how to land with two canopies out. Even with two canopies out landing on the roof of a two story building would be considered a bad landing but it appears that this guy is ok.   The worst thing that can happen when having two canopies out is they get tangled together and they both collapse. While sometimes this can be beyond your control, if you fly them properly you can usually land safely."
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,scribby555,7,Thu Jun 11 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"Good to know that it is possible to ""fly them properly"". I watched a fellow skydiver pull way too late and his reserve deployed at the same time as his main. His two chutes flared away from each other and spiraled him into the ground. The two stabilized his corkscrew motion and directed him straight into the ground. He cut away very late and got minor bumps and bruises from the trees that cushioned his fall. We discussed the situation before the next ride up (which I was on) but nobody (owners, jumpmasters, etc.) talked about any possibility to fly two chutes."
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,rabel,5,Fri Jun 12 01:16:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, we spent a good hour discussing how to fly two canopies in my first jump class many, many, years ago including how to avoid a downplane (although it's not always possible) and how to fly the ""faster"" canopy (usually the main) with the rear risers and very subtle input. Side by side canopies are fine, one in front of the other is usually fine, downplane is bad mojo.  Anyhow, you might want to ask an instructor about a two-out situation if you've never been trained for it. It does happen, obviously, and you don't want to end up on the roof of a house or slamming into the trees."
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,scribby555,2,Fri Jun 12 02:16:14 2015 UTC,"I sure as heck will! I've jumped at my zone a number of times, tandem, static line, etc. and two-canopy situations never came up aside from the aforementioned situation. Thank you very much for the response!"
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,Gosh-Darnit,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:18:14 2015 UTC,"but nobody (owners, jumpmasters, etc.) talked about any possibility to fly two chutes.   Really? We were taught that biplane and side-by-side configurations were flyable. And if you get into a down-plane, you are to cut away.  With a biplane situation, figure out which canopy is ""dominant"" and use that to steer. Side-by-side is a little weirder to steer as you are supposed to use the inner rear risers of the two chutes, and the steering is inversed. Hard to explain, ask about it.  For experienced divers, it may be advised to purposefully turn your side-by-side into a down-plane so you can cut away.  Anyway, ask your DZ's instructors."
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,scribby555,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:29:00 2015 UTC,"I sure will ask next time I'm there! It never came up during tandem nor a static-line training.

AdrenalinePorn,39her6,LeftShark69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:04:10 2015 UTC,"That's a downplane. The only solution is to cut away the main ASAP. You can fly a Biplane or side by side config down, but a downplane or a main/reserve entanglement is bad news."

AdrenalinePorn,39her6,j0lly4numb,11,Thu Jun 11 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're a skydiver. If you are, talk to your instructors.  Short answer: there's a chance of main-reserve entanglement if you try to cut away the main, especially if you're in a stable biplane configuration with the two canopies as was the case here."

AdrenalinePorn,39her6,Gosh-Darnit,4,Thu Jun 11 23:10:04 2015 UTC,"I was never an experienced jumper (so talk to your instructor), but I was always told not to cutaway with two chutes out unless they started to downplane. Then you cutaway asap.  http://parachutistonline.com/feature/two-over-one"
AdrenalinePorn,39her6,j0lly4numb,2,Thu Jun 11 23:42:30 2015 UTC,"With two chutes out, you have three configurations that can result:  a biplane, with the chutes basically on top of each other  a side-by-side, where the chutes are ... side by side.  and a down plane, where the chutes are like this.  It's only safe to cutaway during a down plane configuration, so that the main canopy won't tangle with the reserve. Luckily the other two configurations are relatively safe to fly."

AdrenalinePorn,39her6,seldomsage,3,Thu Jun 11 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"Ideally, 2500-3000 ft or higher, so that the parachute would be open by 2,000 ft."

AdrenalinePorn,384orl,gaedikus,3,Tue Jun 2 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"It basically is. The idea behind the design of these ultra-high performance racing foils is to limit the amount of wetted surface area (area of the hull exposed to water). As you know, water is denser than air, and as a result moving through water causes more drag than moving through air. The downside to this design is that it's very unstable--if you watch it in action it's very prone to capsizing and it requires constant active effort of the crew to prevent this."
AdrenalinePorn,384orl,cjt09,10,Tue Jun 2 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"For reference, the mainsail is actually rigid. Think of an actual airplane wing and can cost nearly 1 million (sail alone). It's also hand built and takes 6-9 months to make if I remember correctly. Team oracle broke one in training too when they flipped the boat.   Source: naval architect and the Oracle team wing designer gave a talk at my school a few years back. It's badass.   *Edit: sorta rigid. It flexes and has control surfaces. You can't just haul it in like a normal sail. Really complex and awesome."
AdrenalinePorn,384orl,dillonph,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"Also, the wing isn't controlled by the normal lines you see on most sailboats. It's a hydraulic system that must be built up or ""charged"" by hand.   What happens when you don't have enough hydraulic pressure to tack your sail?

Yes, they're traveling quickly compared to the surface of the earth, but relative to their own ship, they're going a meter a second or less.

Relative to the ship, they're travelling like 1m/s.  Why you think the speed relative to the earth is significant and the other two aren't, seems stupid.

AdrenalinePorn,37qhp0,xerberos,25,Fri May 29 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"He knows he can do it, he inspected the climb and knows the rock is clean and solid. He won't be breaking solid rock with his hands. If he keeps it within his limits and on known terrain, I think his chances are very good.  Now that I think about it, I've been climbing for years and never had a fall on a climb well within my limits (grade-wise) so theoretically, I could have been soloing all of those. I expect this is true for most climbers."

I agree Alex seems to be pushing it, but only he is capable of knowing how much. Hard to judge, given that his headspace is in another dimension. :) My point was just that, while he is walking a thin line, it is not that surprising he's still walking it. There are some soloists that died, but many 'survived' (eg. Maurizio Zanolla, did it a lot and soloed up to 8a)."

AdrenalinePorn,37qhp0,thewantedman,22,Fri May 29 17:10:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  It depends on the way you are oriented.  The guy that died recently (Dean Potter) invented the sport of free-baseing which is exactly what was described.  This presents a good (not even close to 100%) chance of falling and surviving.  In order for this to work you have to fall in such a way that 2 things happen. First you push out from the wall the wall can rip your chute, things can get caught and you are in for trouble.  Second you need to be facing away from the wall.  When you open a chute the first thing you do is create forward momentum and you don't want to be facing a solid wall when it happens.  Not to mention the fact you need to be pretty high to even attempt a BASE jump.   So ya it's dangerous.    Also Honnold as far as I know doesn't know how to BASE.  Edit:sp"
AdrenalinePorn,37qhp0,weigel23,12,Fri May 29 17:15:35 2015 UTC,It's called solo-base. Freebase is a drug. The effect might be the same ;)

So theoretically, he could use it if he manages to jump far enough from the wall.

AdrenalinePorn,37qhp0,fishy_snack,6,Fri May 29 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"There does need about 400 feet up. Then, when you fall, you have to be able to turn around and face the sky before you open so you might even need to be a bit higher than that to safely deploy. This is assuming you have years of base jumping under your belt as it's not a pick up and go type skill.  In my not so expert opinion (used to skydive, not base jump). I would guess it's just better to go without any sort of weight or movement restrictions."

AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,pussy_lip,3,Thu May 28 16:03:07 2015 UTC,Yes
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,madkiwi,2,Thu May 28 21:04:34 2015 UTC,Small community.  We probably know each other.
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,pussy_lip,8,Thu May 28 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"Hey quick question, never been parachuting, prefer the ground, is there an altitude you can't open your chute at? As in can you open it too high?"
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,pussy_lip,20,Thu May 28 01:40:53 2015 UTC,"No, we're limited more by lower altitudes. It takes a skydiving parachute 600-900+ ft to fully open. BASE parachutes are designed and packed differently; you can configure it to open in less than 200 ft. Here's a jump I did from a 486 ft high bridge, to give you an idea of how fast the opening is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzQqVape_Bg  We often jump out and open right away at 14,000 ft at sunset, and have a 5-10 minute parachute ride down with only a few seconds of freefall. If you jump from 18,000 ft, you need to breathe supplemental oxygen in the plane before you jump. At higher altitudes, you need to have oxygen during the jump to prevent hypoxia."
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,madkiwi,2,Thu May 28 01:51:31 2015 UTC,Wingsuit jumps are also great for enjoying the sunset. Here's one from the end of last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqEKY0mZU3c
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,ohsnapt,3,Thu May 28 02:31:10 2015 UTC,"Wow awesome response, making me want to try it out. Thanks heaps dude"
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,ironfishie,2,Thu May 28 03:43:36 2015 UTC,So ive been thinking of getting into skydiving to ultimately get into BASE. Would it be a bad idea to buy a BASE rig while still only jumping out of planes?
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,sweetjingle,3,Thu May 28 02:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, get good at skydiving first, by the time you're ready for BASE you'll really know whether you want to do it or stick to skydiving."
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,sweetjingle,2,Thu May 28 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would be a bad idea to buy a BASE rig first. If you want to become a BASE jumper, became a proficient skydiver first. Most reputable first BASE jump courses require a minimum of 200 skydives before they'll take you."
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,s1295,2,Thu May 28 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"thank you for your response. Just a couple follow up questions..  I knew BASE jump courses existed but was unaware this was common. I assumed people just took what they knew from the sky to a tall bridge or cliff, no?  Second, what makes BASE rigs a poor choice for skydiving? I understand they open in different lengths but what is the downside to a quick release other than a little more discomfort?  thanks again skier!"
AdrenalinePorn,37j2pl,JonasBrosSuck,3,Thu May 28 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"There's too much to cover, so I advise you to read http://www.basejumper.com/Articles/Getting_Into_BASE/Getting_into_BASE_8.html and grab the Great Book of BASE from http://www.base-book.com/ for a more in depth response.  BASE rigs only have one parachute, and aren't TSO certified. In most countries, if you jump from a plane, you must have a TSO certified dual-parachute system with a main parachute and a reserve parachute. Some dropzones even require you to have an automatic activation device for your reserve parachute. No dropzone in the US will allow you to jump a single-parachute non-TSO'd rig, because the pilot will get in trouble with the FAA."
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,skier,17,Tue May 26 23:41:01 2015 UTC,This was from my friend's perspective. My perspective: http://i.imgur.com/6iM43dX.gifv
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,bfuller181,9,Tue May 26 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"If I find myself with a few years and tens of thousands of dollars to spend, I'm totally getting certified and learning to fly a wingsuit.   On a ""simple"" freefall like this, how much does the wingsuit slow you down? As in, how much extra time would you get if you dropped arms out the whole way down?"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,spikes2020,15,Wed May 27 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"Breakdown of the costs:   ~$2-3k to get licensed (~25 jumps) ~$4-8k for a parachute (depending on used vs new; includes main parachute, reserve parachute, container, and an Automatic Activation Device) ~$1k in misc accessories (altimeter, audible altimeter, helmet, gloves, goggles, jumpsuits, GoPros, etc) At least 175 more jumps @ ~$25/jump = ~$4.4k. A minimum of 200 jumps are required before you can learn to fly a wingsuit. $1-2k for a wingsuit $[A case of beer] x # of times the beer rule is applied. Each time you announce a first (e.g. ""First camera jump!""), or you reach a milestone (e.g. 100th jump, 500th jump, 1000th jump, etc), or you fuck up (e.g. you have to use your reserve), you have to buy a case of beer for everyone at the end of the day. Add more $$$ if you want to get into wingsuit BASE ($1k First Jump Course, $2-4k for gear, $$$ travel costs to BASE jumping locations, and $$$$ on skydiving costs to get proficient at wingsuiting from a plane before you BASE jump it)   Total costs: anywhere from $10-20k by the time you're a wingsuiter, but a lot of that cost is spread out over many years. I started jumping 8 years ago, and didn't start flying wingsuits until last summer.  If you want to get a skydiving license, the first 8-12 jumps are pricey (~$150), and the rest are ~$50-60, including gear. After getting licensed, people rent gear (~$30/jump, or $100/day with unlimited jumps) for a while, then end up getting their own gear. They then readjust their lifestyles to minimize spending in other areas, and maximize spending in the sport."
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,awesomebbq,2,Wed May 27 04:02:45 2015 UTC,I approve all these prices... Got my A license and working on getting 200 jumps I'm only at 35....
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,da5idblacksun,2,Wed May 27 04:57:46 2015 UTC,"Congrats, and have fun with your jumps!"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,da5idblacksun,1 point,Wed May 27 13:40:57 2015 UTC,It's only 25 a jump? Oh wow
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,da5idblacksun,5,Wed May 27 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"That's the going rate for licensed jumpers at most US dropzones. Outside the US, it's usually more like $30-40.  We jump ~4-12 times in a day (depending on weather, length of day, etc.), so we still end up spending a good amount of money when we're at the dropzone."
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,madhjsp,1 point,Wed May 27 06:58:06 2015 UTC,How difficult is wingsuit compared to normal parachuting? What is the reason you need 200 jumps before learning it?
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,awesomebbq,1 point,Wed May 27 07:14:42 2015 UTC,"You need to be comfortable in a skydiving environment first (i.e. you are in control during freefall, have good altitude awareness and awareness of the others around you, and have the ability to respond to emergency situations quickly). All that comes with tons of practice.  The extra material in the suit can get in the way of your deployment/emergency handles. It also makes the suit more difficult to fly. If you put a rookie in a wingsuit, this is more likely to happen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLtA2Na4xZM"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,madhjsp,1 point,Wed May 27 14:03:10 2015 UTC,So interesting. How does it feel compared to freefall? Ive done one tandem jump
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,mockturtlestory,1 point,Wed May 27 18:36:25 2015 UTC,Wingsuit jumps last longer and you travel further horizontally. It's the closest thing to feeling like a bird (and I say that as someone who flies planes).
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,mockturtlestory,1 point,Wed May 27 22:04:15 2015 UTC,Must feel amazing.
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,NoValidTitle,1 point,Thu May 28 00:02:40 2015 UTC,It does. Here's a sunset jump we did end of last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqEKY0mZU3c
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,NoValidTitle,3,Thu May 28 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"Skydiving belly to earth (e.g. tandem jumps): ~120 mph vertical speed and 50-60 seconds of freefall Skydiving freeflying (e.g. falling head down): ~150-180 mph vertical speed and 30-60 seconds of freefall Skydiving wingsuiting: ~20-60 mph vertical speed and 120-180 seconds of freefall   With wingsuiting, your vertical speed is a combination of how well you can fly, and how big your suit is (bigger suits are more advanced). Bigger suits also make it easier to get a better glide ratio. With my current suit (intermediate/advanced), I can get glide ratios of ~1.8 - 3.0. On more advanced suits, you can get glide ratios of 4.0+.  This was my progression from a beginner suit, to an intermediate suit, to an intermediate/advanced suit (TonySuit i-Bird, TonySuit T-Bird, and Squirrel Funk): http://i.imgur.com/xL4O3U3.jpg"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,ZarinaShenanigans,3,Thu May 28 00:25:21 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't a smaller suit be afford more speed and less control, due to decreased wing area and wind resistance, making it less appropriate for beginners?"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,jaoeding,4,Wed May 27 04:34:38 2015 UTC,"I was referring to vertical speeds (fall rate). Horizontal (forward) speeds and total (3D) speeds tend to be greater in bigger suits. Larger suits are more sensitive to control input due to the larger surface area, and require more skill to control. The additional fabric also makes it harder to locate and pull the deployment handles.  A beginner is more likely to get into a flat spin in a larger suit, then black out and lose consciousness. Example of a flat spin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLtA2Na4xZM"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,ZarinaShenanigans,3,Wed May 27 04:43:26 2015 UTC,Oh jesus. I didn't consider uncontrollable spinning as a possibility.
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,ZarinaShenanigans,2,Wed May 27 05:18:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thanks for the explanation!"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,patrickthewhite1,1 point,Wed May 27 06:57:31 2015 UTC,So what happens if you black out and lose consciousness before the parachute is deployed? Do you...die? Or is there some type of safety mechanism in place?
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,IamRooseBoltonAMA,2,Wed May 27 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"If you lose consciousness before deploying your parachute, you better hope your vertical speed is greater than 78 mph. If you're travelling past 840 ft above ground level at over 78 mph, the automatic activation device will deploy your reserve parachute as a last ditch attempt to save your life.  Problem with wingsuits is that our average vertical speeds are much lower than 78 mph when we're flying cleanly. In a spin where you lose consciousness, you'll probably be in a weird body position, so you'd actually fall faster, but there's always a small chance that you'll still fall slow, especially if you have a big suit."
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,LibertyLizard,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"Doesn't that make your first wingsuit jump terrifying? It seems like it'd be easy to panic if you start falling wrong, and how would you know that you're able to do it right before you do it at least once? Do you just literally take a leap of faith?"
AdrenalinePorn,37e5vx,MiniBaa,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"No, not really. You don't start out flying a big suit -- you start with a small suit that's easy to fly. Those suits also have a faster fall rate, so if shit happens, you'll be falling vertically at speeds over 78 mph. My bigger concern was regarding how to pull the parachute, because the technique is slightly different when both your arms have a restricted range of movement with the suit on.  You can still get into flat spins and tumbles in a small suit. I've had a couple of friends who were a little out of control on their first wingsuit jump, including one who got into a bad enough flatspin that his eyes were bloodshot afterwards. However, that's the exception, not the rule."

AdrenalinePorn,36o9rf,Bathtubhero,12,Thu May 21 19:21:16 2015 UTC,Serious question: how often do people die doing things like this?
AdrenalinePorn,36o9rf,sistom,25,Thu May 21 08:01:14 2015 UTC,"Not very, this style of climbing/exploring, while it looks scary, is actually really easy technically.  I would say 95% of people could easily have made that jump if he was 2 feet off the ground as opposed to 1000, and the people that do this kindof things aren't the type that let their nerves cloud their abilities."
AdrenalinePorn,36o9rf,sistom,9,Thu May 21 09:39:55 2015 UTC,"The famous ones, surprisingly rarely. Once they get known, they're good at it.   The beginners? Probably a lot more than we know. A 17 year old Russian girl died recently, beginner, fell 17 stories."

Instead he went quickly, likely almost instantly, doing something that he dedicated his life to. Sure it's not as good as surviving, but everyone dies at some point and he had a good death. I'm not saying the fact he died is lucky, I'm saying the way he died is. I'm trying to pull the one positive out of a shitty situtation"

Gee wow, those billionaire pools they built are still in use, never mind the seats are empty, the city is still violent, the schools are still non-existent, there was barely any infrastructural change at all, and none planned to benefit society. Fucking hell, over here they even built a gigantic stadium in the Amazonas state. Amazonas has no football teams. The fucking thing is sitting there obviously empty, like a huge sore in the amazonian landscape."
AdrenalinePorn,3605va,SubcommanderMarcos,1 point,Sat May 23 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, my experience is only in the pools for summer Olympics and most of the skiing events from winter. And the ones I've seen (only in the us) got reused. But the infrastructure in those towns was always messed up because of it."

AdrenalinePorn,33xscq,jimaug87,15,Mon Apr 27 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"So they let you soak nylon in gas, pack it tightly, and take it onto an airplane? Im gonna go ahead and not believe you. No offense. That sounds wrong.   Edit: holy shit you're right. What a crazy bunch of bastards."
AdrenalinePorn,33xscq,velonaut,6,Mon Apr 27 02:09:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the stunt above, but here's the lamer, truer version:  It's good to release your chute, and pop the reserve under controlled conditions to essentially practice. But this may ruin the main.   So you plan to release a good main to retire it.   Then retrieve it and make a hammock?"
AdrenalinePorn,33xscq,the_number_2,5,Mon Apr 27 04:30:46 2015 UTC,.... and what if the reserve doesn't work?

AdrenalinePorn,33xscq,ilmmad,-12,Sun Apr 26 20:01:19 2015 UTC,Because he wasted it when others could have used it for enjoyment
AdrenalinePorn,33xscq,justinj1821,12,Sun Apr 26 22:44:40 2015 UTC,"He used it for enjoyment...  It's not like there is a limited, dwindling supply of canopies."

AdrenalinePorn,33xscq,justinj1821,6,Mon Apr 27 12:07:10 2015 UTC,"the canopies aren't cheap due in part to artificial price inflation. yes, the best thing he could have done was recycle the material to swaddle starving baby african children.

In doing this stunt, he entertained thousands of people and pulled off something few can say they have.   the parachute was paid for, in full, and he earned money doing this that now gets put back into his local economy. (Assuming he doesn't just buy all his parachutes from ebay or amazon.) There is no rational reason to disapprove of this. It is cool, it is entertaining, and he more than likely was paid to do it.  So there's 1 less parachute in the world. so who gives a shit? I have personally seen warehouses full of parachutes. They are not made from rare materials. really the only negative aspect of this is that it furthered entropy in an immeasurably small way.   Do you have any logical or illogical reasoning for your disapproval or is this just a case of ""oh that dude is way cooler than I am, better make my displeasure known"" crybaby bullshit?"

Also I didn't really see how it was that entertaining to simply cut away and pull his reserve as it happens often enough to skydivers to be considered occasional. It's not as if he was Banzai skydiving or jumping into another plane.  My rational disapproval was simply that it was a waste of a canopy for the sake of a moderately entertaining stunt. I don't know what the context of this was, all I saw was that a guy willingly destroyed his canopy and so I thought that was stupid. You guys seem to get pretty defensive about one guys opinion."

I can't remember the tv show or what the purpose was but he soaked his first chute in some flammable liquid before going out.   I wanna say it was on this tv show that MTV had for a little while where they recreated stunts from music videos. It was definitely a loose interpretation though. For instance they had some guy rollerblade down the same hills in San Fransisco that are briefly featured in the Sabotage video. Anyways, I definitely remember seeing this on tv somewhere, Mythbusters and Man vs Wild also both crossed my mind so I'm really not sure.  Edit: I guess I was right and wrong.

AdrenalinePorn,32xztw,caricamento,15,Sat Apr 18 02:09:53 2015 UTC,"I believe this stunt was a demo for this kind of bicycle.  Typical old-time bikes had a nasty tendency to dump you over that tall front wheel if you got stuck on something.  By reversing the drive and steering wheel, it dramatically cut down the risk of being thrown over the handlebars.  I guess cycling down the stairs of the Capital was a pretty good test of that."
AdrenalinePorn,32xztw,penguingun,6,Fri Apr 17 20:22:23 2015 UTC,You and u/Gabe_ had opposite responses! Who is correct?  My gut tells me its harder to go over a large diameter when than a small one.  Offroad motorcycles have a larger wheel up from to get over obstacles easier.
AdrenalinePorn,32xztw,Zamboni_Driver,16,Fri Apr 17 23:54:53 2015 UTC,I think in this case it has less to do with the smaller wheel and more to do with the center of gravity being moved backwards a little bit which would help it get down those stairs easier.
AdrenalinePorn,32xztw,Bortlekombat904,2,Sat Apr 18 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"yeah I tend to agree, it's more for the center of gravity and not necessarily wheel diameter.  With this improved design, you can kind of ""brace"" for impact with the handlebars, and let the force travel forwards a bit, if you know what I mean. On the other hand, with the traditional design you're sitting so close to the front of the wheel that any amount of braking will tip you over the edge. Please excuse my super wishy washy qualitative physics analysis."
AdrenalinePorn,32xztw,reminiscence,3,Sat Apr 18 05:08:54 2015 UTC,"Neither of them is wrong... it's all about the center of gravity and steering column in relation to the rider. Gabe's guess that he's riding the bike backwards is obviously wrong due to the bike's construction. The thing that makes riding down stairs difficult is the wheel's diameter when compared to the gap between stair edges. If the wheel contacts the edges at just the right spots, piece of cake. The big wheel might actually be more difficult to roll, although on irregular surfaces the rule of thumb is that bigger is better. It just depends on the construction of the obstacle and the wheel.  Source: I ride my bike down stairs a lot and spend a little too much time thinking about the 26"" v. 29"" mountain biking debate."

AdrenalinePorn,324nhk,Eloth,4,Fri Apr 10 15:28:40 2015 UTC,There is something like this in Charlotte. US National Whitewater Center that is man-made: http://usnwc.org/play/water-activities/whitewater-activities/  Although this is open all year and open to the public. They also do concerts and serve tons of micro beers!
AdrenalinePorn,324nhk,lykedoctor,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Although this is open all year and open to the public.   Yeah, that's the great thing about these courses. When there's no water anywhere else, they're still open, and anyone's free to use them. Lee Valley, unfortunately, only runs for a couple of hours a week in the winter (and requires separate assessments for its courses), but the rest are open year-round."
AdrenalinePorn,324nhk,whatthespence,3,Sat Apr 11 11:28:11 2015 UTC,Dat resolution :3
AdrenalinePorn,324nhk,LillyAndLuna,2,Sat Apr 11 06:12:44 2015 UTC,I am hopingb you can explain what CIWW is? Is it like those indoor surfing facilities that you can control conditions in except for whitewater boating? Because if so that is awesome and my town needs one. I've always wanted to learn to whitewater kayak but opportunities and locations to do so are pretty slim on the ground here in the Midwest
AdrenalinePorn,324nhk,LillyAndLuna,2,Fri Apr 10 19:45:09 2015 UTC,"It's a bit like that. There's a concrete channel with a few drops, and then plastic blocks that can be moved around to reconfigure the course. They usually keep these in fixed positions, though. Water can be pumped through at different rates to vary the difficulty (CIWW goes between 2 and 8 cumecs, IIRC). Difficulty varies between class 2 to 3, maybe higher for the race layout. Facilities like this are pretty rare - in the UK, we have a fair few (HPP, Teesside, Pinkston, CIWW, Lee Valley - which has two courses, one class 2 and one 4 - and the Nene). I know of at least one in the US (USNWC).   In this photo, the course is in the race configuration they use for about 3 events per year, and they only run it for these events - it's too dangerous for regular use. It's the most fun it gets, though!   If you're interested in whitewater, look for a nearby club. There is almost certainly one wherever you are. Also, check out /r/kayaking, /r/whitewater, and look up your location on American Whitewater - you may be surprised."

AdrenalinePorn,324nhk,LillyAndLuna,2,Sat Apr 11 04:03:16 2015 UTC,There is whitewater in the Midwest.  Wisconsin has a number of rivers with good stretches and you'd be surprised to find even Illinois has some too.

AdrenalinePorn,31wxdp,Funkonomic,3,Wed Apr 8 20:52:23 2015 UTC,Siccck man. Yeah how'd the landing go? Looks kind of flat but pictures from down the hill always look deceiving. I'm trying to teach myself photoshop so I did some colour correction and tried to grab some more snow detail if you want it.
AdrenalinePorn,31wxdp,obi21,6,Wed Apr 8 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"Do you mind if I critique your edit ? I always like to help :)  You did pretty good on the color correction, but you warmed it a tad bit too much and now you have magentas creeping into your snow and the right part of the sky, I would tone that back to colder tones a bit (you can also see it on the puffs of snow around the rider).  You also went a bit too far with the contrast, your blacks are crushed (that means that the transition from dark areas to black is too sudden, leaving too much area completely black).  You did great with the detail recovery, exposure on the snow is pretty much spot on now.  This might sound complicated if you're just beginning, but I would advise you to quickly learn masks and selective editing, ie adjustment A to part A, X to X etc (in this example, treating the snowy parts differently from the rock). Trust me this is what takes your editing skills to the next level, and the sooner you get started the more natural it will feel.  I'm just nitpicking here though, trying to give you pointers, all in all the edit is already really good :)"
AdrenalinePorn,31wxdp,LSatyreD,3,Thu Apr 9 06:59:17 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind my asking, how do you do your masks? I always have trouble delineating between the zones (here snow vs rock vs sky). The best method I've found so far is to use a feathered edge but this leaves the transition area 'muddy' at best.  Also, in reference to the magentas and the crushed blacks is there some way to 'highlight' these problems? My eyes have trouble picking them out sometimes. Is there any way to filter to show that certain areas are over-adjusted or is it entirely an experience thing?"
AdrenalinePorn,31wxdp,obi21,3,Thu Apr 9 12:15:21 2015 UTC,"Well I don't really do that many masks anymore, since I stopped doing photography full time and I'm slaving away in a stupid office job... /rant over  But yeah you have lots of different methods to create your masks depending on the situation, don't underestimate the power of the quick selection tool coupled with refine edge (smart radius or w/e it was called works real well in the newer versions of PS), this usually works more than fine to select the sky.  Otherwise just grab a brush and practice practice practice, keep changing the hardness/opacity (I think alt + right click and drag vertical/horizontal was the shortcut?) and you'll end up getting a feel for it and making it look natural, definitely think you need a decent tablet for this kind of work though. The issue with ""painting"" in the masks is that this will rarely work well if you try to copy paste it to another adjustment layer, because you painted it for this particular adjustment and it might not work for the next one, so you have to keep doing it manually, which can get pretty labor intensive, but definitely brings the best results when you get the experience.  There are some ways of using filters to help you see stuff, but they are usually used more in portraits than landscape/action shots. Check out this video which contains quite a few of those techniques, or google around for ""supporting layers"".  Personally I rarely ended up using these techniques, and used my eyes (on a properly calibrated screen) and the histograms mainly. Histograms will come in particularly handy regarding clipped highlights and shadows (crushed blacks/overblown highlights), if you see a big spike at either side of your histograms you know you have an issue, you can also select some parts of your image to check only the histogram of this particular part (if I remember correctly, sorry I'm a bit rusty and at work so can't check, but I know there's a way to do this), and you can also use it to check saturations and which colors are dominating, this could for example reveal some magentas in the highlights for this image (spike of red on the right of the histogram).  Sorry for the wall of text, don't hesitate to shoot me more questions if you want, I'm bored as hell."

First, check out /u/EmcOnTheRocks' POV video.  Starts to look a little more doable, eh?   Now once upon a time I led hiking tours throughout Sedona with occasional forays into the Canyon, Monument Valley, and assorted other Four Corners delectables. We were based out of a hostel in Flagstaff (the Gateway to the Grand Hole in the Ground) so we had all levels of skill on every hike. Whenever we had nervous folk, we'd take them on a bit of a confidence course, generally a harsh angle a foot or so off the ground and traversing 20-ish feet so they could see for themselves that they couldn't slip on sandstone if they tried.  I'm not saying that this isn't ballsy as all hell, but it (obviously) is doable."

AdrenalinePorn,2ysxm2,DevsiK,12,Fri Mar 13 03:11:51 2015 UTC,How much do they scout and plan the route before they go?
AdrenalinePorn,2ysxm2,GloriousYardstick,19,Thu Mar 12 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"Quite a bit. They usually take photos and memorize which lines they want to take.   If it's an area no one has been to before, they'll often do a scouting run in the helicopter to find lines and get an idea of the snow conditions."
AdrenalinePorn,2ysxm2,SexualHarasmntPanda,11,Thu Mar 12 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"They also have the knowledge to see whether a line is safe to ride or is at risk for an avalanche, there's a lot of planning before riding a route like this."
AdrenalinePorn,2ysxm2,Scotai,3,Thu Mar 12 18:58:36 2015 UTC,"To add a bit more... there is a fairly reliable method to ""walk out a jump"" whereby you take into consideration the distance you need to travel in the air and the slope of the run to the jump as well as the jump itself and you can come up with a number of steps that you need to hike up the hill from the point you want to leave the ground. It is pretty interesting stuff.  Source: Northstar Burton Academy"

If you go frame by frame, you can see that the roads and parking lot are cleared of cars and there's a mass of cars stopped in each direction. It looks like a sponsored event with cooperation from the local authorities, so there wasn't going to be anybody under him."

AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,bdz1,7,Thu Mar 5 20:14:55 2015 UTC,Half a second before his parachute fully opens he's changing hands again.  Then again I assume a dude base-para-zipline-chuting is experienced enough to deal with this problem.

AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,gamingchicken,8,Thu Mar 5 20:11:15 2015 UTC,Nice stable opening. /s
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,Taylorvongrela,-3,Thu Mar 5 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"Right? He didn't even bother trying to get stable before pulling. I mean, I know that guy probably has thousands of dives under his belt, but there were just so many unsafe practices going on in this that I really can't condone this.  A selfie stick?  For base jumping?  Are you trying to get that caught in the rigging and die?  because that's how you die."
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,jaxxer,-1,Thu Mar 5 22:28:32 2015 UTC,"No, but when you only get one shot and your life is on the line, would you want to half ass it or would you make sure it was done right?"
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,Taylorvongrela,6,Fri Mar 6 02:43:58 2015 UTC,He didn't exactly have time for a coffee and cake before he pulled his chute. Stupid him for not falling to his death in the name of a safe opening!
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,jaxxer,7,Fri Mar 6 12:37:04 2015 UTC,"Ok well excuse me for calling someone out on stupid risks that didn't need to be taken. This isn't a normal dive from a plane where he's got lots of altitude and a reserve chute and a cypress as layers of safety. No he's got one shot here. It's either the shoot opens correctly, or you plummet to the ground.  When you've only got one chance to get it right and your life is potentially on the line, I'm going to take that extra half second to roll my body just a little bit further so I can open in a more stable position. And I'm sure as hell not going to bring along a 5 foot long selfie stick that could easily get caught in the rigging as well during an unstable opening.    BASE jumping is exciting as hell without adding unnecessary risks to the mix.  Even the very best and most experienced have accidents, and it seems like we lose more and more divers every year from them. So yeah, I will always speak up when I see unsafe practices being praised, and people can downvote me here all they want. Real skydivers will understand my concerns."
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,lliebler,3,Fri Mar 6 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but the guy that was sponsored to do this wins out over a stranger on the Internet"
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,mermaidrampage,2,Fri Mar 6 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"That's fine.  I don't expect random people on the internet to have insight into safe base jumping practices, so y'all can downvote me all you want.  When your chute opens from an unstable position, you could cause a number of very serious issues, and there is no room for error in base jumping.  You have no time to solve the issue with your chute.  On top of that, he brought a selfie stick with him.  Given his unstable opening, it's not out of the realm of possibility that it could have gotten caught in a suspension line as the chute opened.  Maybe the suspension lines would have just kicked the selfie stick out of his hand, but maybe not.  Maybe it causes a line over or a horseshoe or any other (human-error produced) major parachute malfuction.  Then that's guys dead right now and we're all having a very different discussion.  Skydiving and base jumping are about minimizing the risk involved.  This guy would rather look cool while doing it then give himself a better chance at walking away.   So bring on the downvotes folks."
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,bdz1,1 point,Fri Mar 6 13:47:05 2015 UTC,"It looks like this was a planned sponsored event by Speed Stick, and I assume it was all insured, which means that somebody reviewed the safety. Maybe he opened from a bad position - I'm not an expert and I won't pretend to be, so forgive me for taking your comment with a grain of salt"
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,JamesLLL,0,Fri Mar 6 16:00:44 2015 UTC,Base dive are dangerous if the rigging is problem.
AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,Omnilatent,6,Fri Mar 6 16:06:30 2015 UTC,No shit your glasses fell off.  Did you really think your glasses would stay on your face while freefalling from a moving zipline?    Still cool though.

AdrenalinePorn,2y1mql,insensitivename,2,Thu Mar 5 22:17:17 2015 UTC,"So, I'm having trouble seeing how he pulled the cord. Was it attached to the clip somehow and him falling from it pulled the chute? Because I can't really track where his arm goes to, it just looks like it's flailing around to me.  Edit: oh ok, I think I see it. He changes his camera arm just before unclipping and with his right hand he pulls the chute. His shorts hid the motion from view since his legs go between the cord and the camera."

AdrenalinePorn,2xpczm,sideone,2,Tue Mar 3 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"People fall over their own feet. People trip up for all sorts of reasons, it's just that if it happens on a street it doesn't matter. Up there it would."
AdrenalinePorn,2xpczm,sideone,2,Tue Mar 3 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"It's also far easier to lose your balance or slip on something like that.  Notice how he was walking on the outside of the crane and barely holding on?  Instead of having his feet running perpendicular to the bar he was standing on, so that it's much harder to slip off the side.  All it takes is a bit of dust and your foot can slip off to the side.  Or a sudden gust of wind, something that happens quite regularly at heights.  Then you've got the balance issue.  It's very easy when you can't see anything immediately below or to the side of you, for your balance to be thrown off unpredictably and suddenly.    Shit, you could get light-headed, have a cramp or seizure, be attacked by a bird, any number of things could cause you to fall to your certain death.  I've seen crazier, but that doesn't mean there isn't a very high degree of risk involved here, and to pretend this is somehow no more dangerous than walking on the ground because you're focused is just plain silly.    I'm not saying he should sit home and do nothing because he could die, but to do shit like this without any sort of safety measures is just asking for trouble and reckless.  You can get a cheap climbing harness, short length of rope, and a few carabiners, then you'd have a simple way to attach yourself when you want to stop and look around or take pics/video.  You'd still have just as much fun, and still be taking a serious risk, because you still have to do the majority of climbing without the harness - but I guess if you aren't needlessly putting yourself in harms way the internet won't think you're cool.     It's just like driving a car, your seatbelt may not make you any less likely to crash or have someone crash into you, but in the event of the unexpected, you are far less likely to die if you have it on, so why wouldn't you wear it?  Putting on a helmet and wrapping yourself in bubble wrap would be extreme, but a simple harness in this situation would be the equivalent of a seatbelt."

He moved everyone about 20 miles north.  Took me about 6 minutes to fly there in a 130kt descending dive and then loaded 3 of them in. Took me about 15 minutes to climb back up there.  Next load I picked up a 140' longline with everyone's gear, extra fuel and the GT Racers and innertubes.   Spent about an hour and a half ferrying everyone in. At noon, another buddy flew up to check it out with his wife since he saw the jump we built on IG. He did a few minutes of flying a video guy for me, while I filmed them racing.   He left and I spent about an hour ferrying everyone out at 3pm (was faster in the climb without passengers.)  Last load, grabbed the camera guys and flew home."

AdrenalinePorn,2x550p,wrathofkhat,20,Thu Feb 26 02:08:23 2015 UTC,This is on the reservoir side of a dam.  It flows downstream.
AdrenalinePorn,2x550p,codemercenary,30,Thu Feb 26 02:09:45 2015 UTC,There are few things on this earth that scare me more than these drainage pipes. The thought of even going near one just gives me chills.

AdrenalinePorn,2x550p,JakeBloom,16,Thu Feb 26 04:38:51 2015 UTC,Big. Black. Hole.
AdrenalinePorn,2x550p,RocketManV,10,Thu Feb 26 05:59:05 2015 UTC,"Combine the following things: A drainage hole that sucks in water (or everything that's in the water), that becomes a tunnel/pipe going deep down, later on curving horizontally to spew water out water like a water cannon dozens of meters below where you were before.  If you get sucked in, there's nothing you can do. It's pitch black, there's tons of water thrashing around you with immense speed and force smacking you against the walls to and fro, you're being sucked deep into the ground with zero control. It's an extremely violent burial."

AdrenalinePorn,2wx9hb,coolsideofyourpillow,16,Tue Feb 24 04:16:14 2015 UTC,You're afraid of heights. What's the quickest way of getting back down to ground level? Jumping! Kinda makes sense.

AdrenalinePorn,2wx9hb,lardo1800,2,Tue Feb 24 15:17:02 2015 UTC,Im afraid of the actual vertical height. I have been in planes and have been more relaxed than in buildings because one I cant do anything about it and two im looking at an angle and I guess I feel more comfortable woth that than staring straight down from a tall building.

AdrenalinePorn,2wx9hb,aimhelix,6,Tue Feb 24 21:17:22 2015 UTC,I hope you have a BASE rig on. Slider down/no slider.
AdrenalinePorn,2wx9hb,CodeYeti,6,Tue Feb 24 00:29:46 2015 UTC,Off topic.. but I've always been curious. What the hell are sliders for??
AdrenalinePorn,2wx9hb,aimhelix,10,Tue Feb 24 05:35:03 2015 UTC,"They slow down the opening of a parachute when they are ""up"" so that you don't break yourself by opening one at terminal velocity. On slider ""down"" jumps (below 600 ft usually) the slider is left in the ""down"" position and does little more than keep the 4 sets of lines sorted rather than slow down your opening.  Basically the wind hits the slider first, which will eventually slowly slide down your lines due to the pressure of the parachute trying to open until it rests above your head, in the down position.  This isn't a BASE jumping rig, but rather a skydiving one, but this should give you the idea. The thing holding the 4 lines apart the slides down during his opening is the slider.  On a BASE rig, you would likely have a mesh slider so that it takes less air away from the opening, because you're opening much, much lower in BASE jumping.  http://youtu.be/P00s_duKUio  Source: Skydiver & Maybe one day will-be BASE jumper"

AdrenalinePorn,2wqrgw,MrPinkle,7,Sun Feb 22 15:45:21 2015 UTC,I see jumps in this valley all the time. Can someone tell me where it is or what it's called?
AdrenalinePorn,2wqrgw,IamMotherDuck,7,Sun Feb 22 08:05:32 2015 UTC,"It's definitely Switzerland as /u/Smoates said, not sure where however. The exact same place is shown in the documovie The Bridge to Nowhere at around 9:25 (and then again some time later), and they mention Switzerland a bit before that, but I can't remember if they mention the place by name or not in it.   DISCLAIMER: If you're going to watch it, it's a tough documentary, it's about various basejumping deaths, tries to make some kind of sense of it all. There's some gore. Nicely edited though."
AdrenalinePorn,2wqrgw,BlackGyver,7,Sun Feb 22 11:13:43 2015 UTC,"I think its  Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland.  I recognise the valley (I visited it around 3 years ago). It's apparently one of the biggest towns for extreme sports in all of central Europe. I actually recall trekking down the valley and coming across a number of graves and memorial sites paying respect to the base jumpers who's shoots unfortunately failed. Very sad, but a beautiful place indeed..."

AdrenalinePorn,2wehyh,shredadactyl,3,Thu Feb 19 08:22:31 2015 UTC,"It's a backpack with fat little skis, probably for skinning up the mountain."
AdrenalinePorn,2wehyh,rickzor,3,Thu Feb 19 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"Look like a wide pair of ski's, probably for deep powder. I can't figure out his stance though, can't really see his feet properly."

This pic could be from the 90's-just a few years ago. He's on an alpine board too, at least has stance and bindings, so he most likely just hikes/skins in his ski boots and swaps his gear.  As for the stance, his knees are towards us, he's hunched over."

AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,knotaredditor,6,Sun Feb 15 05:51:17 2015 UTC,"I live walking distance from the Wedge. When huge swells come and conditions are right, waves hit 25+ feet easily.   There's always huge crowds lining the beach to watch kids charge the waves and get thrown into the air; good times."

AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,tuckerj1990,2,Sun Feb 15 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"It's real; most likely, the guy carved up the face of the wave and jumped off his board."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,enpe,0,Sun Feb 15 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"What enpe said except 'carving' is more of a snowboarder term. Getting air off the face is fun and easy and a good idea with a wave that closes like that.   That said, he is way up there but not unbelievable considering the size and power of the Wedge. Normally your board goes with you, he could have been riding without a leash."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,high_side,2,Sun Feb 15 23:53:00 2015 UTC,Ah ok. That makes sense. I totally forgot waves exist other than mushy florida swell vomit.

AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,Nilum1,10,Sun Feb 15 13:00:52 2015 UTC,"It's water, only fucked if he can't swim, in which case he chose the wrong hobby."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,FairlyFaithfulFellow,8,Sun Feb 15 13:42:06 2015 UTC,"Also assuming he lands properly, which he probably does if he's experienced enough to be out surfing in those conditions. It's entirely possible to hurt yourself badly from that height with a bad landing."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,JoyfulDeath,3,Sun Feb 15 15:33:43 2015 UTC,Hey did you see the enlarged picture? It look like he's not in control of his fall. Do that mean he's going to get hurt?
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,FairlyFaithfulFellow,2,Sun Feb 15 16:49:29 2015 UTC,"I did see it yeah, you get quite a lot of air time from a jump like that, so it's not easy to tell how much control he has from the picture, but he'll probably be fine."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,JoyfulDeath,2,Sun Feb 15 17:24:55 2015 UTC,Ah cool. So... you have quite bit experience being in the sea?
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,FairlyFaithfulFellow,3,Sun Feb 15 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"In the sea in general yes, but not more than a few days worth of surfing experience. I have however dived and jumped from similar heights many times, been sailing competitively for several years (and been thrown out of my dinghy several times, although not as high), and have also used canoe, kayak, row boat and motor boat many times.  He might feel a bit sore because it's hard to land a perfect landing like that, but it shouldn't be too hard to avoid a bad landing. Landing flat on your stomach will hurt from pretty much any height, but that's not very hard to avoid."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,JoyfulDeath,2,Sun Feb 15 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"Ah gotcha... May I ask are you at all familiar with the water in northern Califronia, especially above bay area? I really want to start freediving and bodyboarding but people keep tell me I'll die if I go in the water.   Then I see something like this..."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,FairlyFaithfulFellow,3,Sun Feb 15 17:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all familiar with those waters. Most of my experience is from Norway. Freediving is fun, but I'm not very good at it, I don't see much risk involved with it though as long as you learn the basic techniques for it. I've never done bodyboarding, most of my high-speed falls are from waterskis/wakeboard/tubes, falling quickly and tumbling through the water can be quite disorienting at times, but not much of a problem.  There's a few dangers relatively unique to surfing/bodyboarding/big waves in relatively shallow water, big waves can push you down with considerable force and in some places/waves there might be strong undercurrents dragging you further out to sea, holding you under water for some time and making it hard to get ashore. Also, because surfing waves form in shallow water, hitting the ground after you fall might be a real danger depending on where you are, if it's rocky and not just sand it can be quite serious.  These are all things I've heard about have mostly no experience with myself because it hasn't been relevant for me most of the time. For any of these activities you need to have some swimming skills though, but I'm assuming you already know how to swim. Why is it that people think it's so dangerous in the water?"
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,high_side,2,Sun Feb 15 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Die? No. The waves can be rough and there are rocks everywhere but plenty of people dive/surf/bodyboard. Monterey, Ocean Beach, Salmon Creek, etc. You just have to be a decent swimmer, know the ocean, and have a thick wetsuit."
AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,jemyr,2,Sun Feb 15 18:39:20 2015 UTC,But I see the wave crashing against rocks.

AdrenalinePorn,2vy47d,scottyah,1 point,Sun Feb 15 19:14:09 2015 UTC,"I can't tell too much from the pic, but I know the wedge is famous for it's shore-breaks. This picture shows it pretty well. If he lands on the backside, he might get sucked into the churning wave, otherwise he'll be fine if he gets out of the way of the next waves if it's a set. If he falls into really shallow water, he's gonna have a bad time.   It looks like he decided to bail off the backside so he would avoid going over the falls onto the hard-packed sand, especially since that wave was pretty walled out and he couldn't ride it to a side."

Nearly shitting myself in the plane, the ""OH FUCK"" feeling at the door, and then it didn't matter any more.  You do it (skydiving, or anything else you manage to convince yourself you can't do) and then realize that all the doubt and thoughts in your head are holding you back from doing some crazy awesome things is an awesome thing to feel.

Tiny rocks a few feet deep over moist ground is hands down the best dry surface to hit.   I fucking free run and jump from great heights.  I fucking rock climb and bike and skate and do extreme body weight exercises and stretching and have been for over two decades.  Get the fuck over it."

AdrenalinePorn,2v3fok,Duality_Calamity,20,Sun Feb 8 06:17:50 2015 UTC,"What draws me towards adrenaline sports is the ability to do amazing things through managing risk factors. I skydive and the accident rate is extremely low for the sport overall because a large majority of people are extremely safety cautious. Yes there is risk involved and there is always that chance but with the proper precautions the chances of serious injury or death can be reduced. I drove a motorcycle for three years (had to sell it) and I had seriously close calls but was able to avoid injury/death through being aware and always wearing the appropriate attire (ATGATT). There is so much truly awesome stuff to experience in this world and being unnecessarily risky increases your chance of missing out on the beauty of life.   TL;DR Have fun, but play it safe."
AdrenalinePorn,2v3fok,MardukX,10,Fri Feb 13 07:50:05 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing - I'm coming from the perspective that I might be coming from the other direction, knee down on the pavement, in a blind corner on a sportbike, going significantly above the speed limit. Is this the safest thing in the world? No...but I can do this within my own limits to stay in my lane and not blatantly put others at risk. If some longboarder drifts into oncoming traffic in said corner, it is very well a fatal crash assuming both parties are traveling ~45-50+mph.    I wish no harm on anyone who does this. The risk is part of the game - I get that...this is AdrenalinePorn after all. But minimize those risks to yourself.   (All of the above said is assuming this is not a closed course...which it very well may be. Just speaking more generally to explain my stance above)."

Hovering in place was actually quite difficult even in no wind. Light wind and the balance of the aircraft are making the thing shift around a lot, and it takes a long time to develop a sense of which way the chopper is going to move and then counter it properly so that you stay in one place.   Remembering that makes me want to take flying lessons."

AdrenalinePorn,2uhhdy,FearTheCron,23,Mon Feb 2 11:48:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! A 'siq' is what the locals there call these massive ravines that cut through the sandstone mountains - like the one he's jumping over. 'Jebel Rum' means ""Mount Rum"" and is tallest peak there, and 'Ridjim Assaf' is the name of one of the climbing/scrambling routes up the mountain."
AdrenalinePorn,2uhhdy,FearTheCron,2,Mon Feb 2 12:35:39 2015 UTC,I'm curious what climbing was like there. Wadi Rum is one of my top destinations to climb!
AdrenalinePorn,2uhhdy,derekmelvin,4,Mon Feb 2 12:52:55 2015 UTC,"The scenery is spectacular and the climbing is pretty hard core with hundreds of long trad routes on some good and some poor rock. Route finding is hard and the insides of the mountains are basically huge mazes with hidden passages and surprising features. It's awesome! Even if you're not into trad, there are plenty of scrambling routes up the mountains called Bedouin routes. I think they offer the most spectacular scenery of all and some of them are pretty hard and scary... It's definitely worth a visit + the small village at the base of the valley is a great place to relax, drink some sweet tea and eat Tahini."

AdrenalinePorn,2uhhdy,FinntheHue,4,Mon Feb 2 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"It's like a multi-pitch route, you do it with your pack on, and besides, the jump is not that bad, really. The chasm is deep, but the odds of you not making it (assuming you've made it that far) are negligible, and so a light pack makes no real difference."
AdrenalinePorn,2uhhdy,ehhhsoody,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:18:10 2015 UTC,"Why do you say the odds of not making it are negligible? The perspective in this picture makes it hard to see where the guy in the picture is going to land. Also, how do you get back?"
AdrenalinePorn,2uhhdy,Poop_is_Food,2,Tue Feb 3 01:55:18 2015 UTC,"I say this because I made the jump and if you get that far along the route, it probably means that this jump will be easy for you. The perspective does indeed make it hard to see but he's actually aiming for a small step on the other side. The route continues up to the summit and from there you take a different way down which requires 4-5 abseils."

AdrenalinePorn,2u7hwy,R3greddit,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:08:08 2015 UTC,Sorry for the late comment. I've been thinking of taking whitewater kayaking classes on the American river this summer.  Has it been really un-raftable?
AdrenalinePorn,2u7hwy,somewhereonariver,2,Wed Feb 18 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"People say that but it's really not true. What they are doing in light of the little rain we are getting is just not letting flow out two days a week. For some reason the public perception is that the river is low all the time but it's actually not what's happening. 5 days out of the week the flow is totally fine, and in my opinion, perfect for learning how to kayak. I learned on the same river and on the same flow. I hope you have a great time on the river this summer! Hopefully I'll see you out there! If you haven't found a company to do your instruction with I recommend CCK very highly. Really cool people who are fair with pricing and love getting people on the river. Happy boating! If you have any more questions feel free hit me up!"

AdrenalinePorn,2u7hwy,polycronopolis,2,Sat Jan 31 07:56:56 2015 UTC,"I would say the best way is to apply to a company in the spring time. To work for any reputable or EVEN semi-reputable outfitter you would have to go through that companies guide school. Most guide schools happen in the transition weeks from spring to summer and will cost you some money to attend. What guide school consists of is rafting everyday for about a week learning how to guide a boat, safety techniques, etc. From my experience going through guide school and teaching guide schools, it mainly focuses on keeping your customers safe and yourself safe as well. After you go through guide school and ""pass"" the company you did guide school with will hopefully hire you and throw you some work. This is just what I have seen from being around the industry for a while. If you have any more questions or clarifications feel free to message me!"

They trust those ledges with their lives, no doubt about that. But they have to trust all their gear. Rock climbing is one of the few sports I can think of that you cannot afford to go cheap on your gear. That being said not every hold (crack in the rock where an anchor is set) is 100% trustworthy. When the hold is a bit sketchy but it's the best available, they'll sleep/eat/shit in there harnesses tied in to a separate anchor either higher or lower.   I ask them why they don't always do that because that's exactly what I'd do. Their response just makes me laugh ""It's not that comfortable"".

AdrenalinePorn,2tovl7,ck_mooman,4,Mon Jan 26 16:18:51 2015 UTC,We like having redundancy. So we kept our harnesses on the whole time. Clipped into the portaledge with one rope and also clipped into a separate climbing rope too. Always good to have 2 points of contact.    And the gear is actually really strong. Lots of people look at a climbing rope and think it is too thin but there are no reported cases of a climbing rope just breaking from a fall. They can be cut if pulled over a sharp edge but none have straight up broken.
AdrenalinePorn,2tovl7,ck_mooman,5,Mon Jan 26 18:26:42 2015 UTC,"It's strong stuff. Daisy chains, cams, etc. all that stuff is rock solid. Climbing rope is surprisingly strong. But then again companies like Black Diamond know people are trusting their lives with their gear."

AdrenalinePorn,2t641q,kabulian,13,Wed Jan 21 13:46:51 2015 UTC,This is absolutely beautiful picture. Would you mind explaining a little as to what is going on?
AdrenalinePorn,2t641q,baberonies,18,Wed Jan 21 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"So I had to Google it. It sounds kinda like rugby, but on horseback. And instead of using a ball, they use a dead goat. People fall off the horse and get trampled regularly, or the herd of horses can go out of bounds and into the crowd of spectators."
AdrenalinePorn,2t641q,Guns_and_Dank,16,Wed Jan 21 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly like you said - it's an incredibly intense sport. Sometimes the horses will charge into the crowd and you'll see spectators literally diving aside and sometimes getting trampled. It's crazy! The aim of the game is to take the goat or calf carcass around a pole on the far side of the field and drop it in a circle close to the VIP section to score a goal. If it takes too long to score a goal, the bounty for a goal goes up and up (starting at around 20 bucks and ending sometimes at 100-200 USD per goal). Lots of betting goes on at these games and the horses can cost 100-200K USD. Warlords, governors and other VIPs regularly attend - making it a high priority target and security extremely tight. Lots of guns, bodyguards, betting, sometimes blood, and adrenaline. They say this is the predecessor of polo and has been played for centuries in Central Asia.   Also, the player who scores the last goal gets to keep the carcass and apparently the meat is nicely tenderized for the BBQ. :)   Edit: Forgot to mention, this sport was banned during the Taliban as it was considered immoral. Same for fighting different animals - in Afghanistan they do dog, bird and even camel fights. The largest Buzkashi game happens at Naw Ruz (New Year - on 21 March) in Mazar - with Buzkashi, a 50km donkey race and camel fighting."

AdrenalinePorn,2t641q,Xelol,1 point,Wed Jan 21 22:02:33 2015 UTC,"There are definitely similarities, but this buzkashi match had over 100 horsemen and it often becomes a complete free-for-all. They say the calf carcass starts off at 100 kg, but loses weight throughout the game (dehydration and loss of limbs) so it starts to become slightly easier to score.   Seconds before in the picture above, the guy holding the calf carcass was being whipped by other players, with horses slamming into him. You can see on his face the sheer determination and lack of fucks given. He went on to score the point and win the bounty.  I'm not a video guy, but I'll try to shoot some video next time to show a bit more of the game's intensity."

AdrenalinePorn,2t641q,Guns_and_Dank,2,Wed Jan 21 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"In this case it's a calf carcass, but it could equally be a goat carcass. Buzkashi literally means ""goat bashing""."

AdrenalinePorn,2t0742,somekook,6,Tue Jan 20 02:08:34 2015 UTC,Either this is a composite image or I want the lens that can capture stars and action at the same time without blur.
AdrenalinePorn,2t0742,ieatgravel,9,Tue Jan 20 06:43:30 2015 UTC,I could've been done in a single long exposure then using a flash as the skier passes by. I've done something similar out in death valley example
AdrenalinePorn,2t0742,spiffyjj,5,Tue Jan 20 07:09:29 2015 UTC,"True. That's a great point. Thanks for sharing your example, too."
AdrenalinePorn,2t0742,ieatgravel,1 point,Tue Jan 20 08:17:21 2015 UTC,"That's a valid technique, but this particular image looks like a composite. If you look at the large size and check out how the skier looks around the edges and shadows it doesn't look like it was done in one frame. Not that I care either way, but I'm pretty sure he combined a couple of shots for this."
AdrenalinePorn,2t0742,Trapasaurus_Rex,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:09:03 2015 UTC,I'd be surprised if it was a composite. The long exposure plus flash method described would be perfect here.
AdrenalinePorn,2t0742,aimhelix,2,Tue Jan 20 18:42:03 2015 UTC,Long exposure with a manual flash and gels. You see it a lot with light painters.  Check out the strobist blog for more info
AdrenalinePorn,2t0742,Aphextwinhamster,2,Tue Jan 20 09:54:06 2015 UTC,"This is pulled off using ""slow synch flash"" or ""2nd curtain flash"" :). Shutter opens for as long as you need (stars, aurora exposed) and then a quick burst of flash as the skier passes buy. Since the flash happens so fast and is much stronger than the ambient light, you get a picture resulting like this one."

AdrenalinePorn,2skslz,8plur8,6,Fri Jan 16 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"The location of this spacenet was the Fruit Bowl in Moab, Utah.  You could walk around the top of the canyon to all five anchor points without having to hike down.  In many instances of rigging, climbing down and back up is necessary, but in this case, it was just a matter of walking the legs around.  Here is the view from Google Earth."

AdrenalinePorn,2se6av,fernguts,5,Wed Jan 14 12:08:49 2015 UTC,"Photo description:   The French Fishing vessel Alf (LS683637, MMSI 228378000) during a storm in the Irish Sea. The crew of a Royal Navy vessel rushed to the aid of an injured fisherman trapped by bad weather on the Irish Sea. The Royal Navy Hydrographic survey vessel HMS Echo was carrying out maritime security operations when she received a request for assistance from Milford Haven Coastguard. The coastguard had already scrambled both an RAF search and rescue helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat to rescue the fisherman, but weather conditions were deteriorating fast. The 5 metre high swell meant it was not possible to lower a winchman safely onto the French vessel‚Äôs deck and assist the fisherman who was showing signs of hypothermia. Once Echo was called in, the 3,500 tonne ship attempted to provide some shelter for the RNLI lifeboat to get alongside the French fishing vessel, Alf, but once again the weather prevented a rescue. This left them with no choice but to escort the fishing vessel closer inland before the helicopter was able to winch the injured fisherman to safety."

I used to do this for a job when I left school,  and in fact used to to do powerline clearance, which is how I know the line beneath the picture isn't even a powerline. Probably a phone line. Look where it leads: no insulators."
AdrenalinePorn,2s8rgb,doesnotlikecricket,3,Thu Jan 15 07:31:27 2015 UTC,theres a 12 foot ladder in the picture and it looks like if you stacked it twice thats about the height youre at

AdrenalinePorn,2s16pm,sfchillin,2,Sun Jan 11 05:59:46 2015 UTC,I'd be shit scared I'd run over one of these freeboarders if I commuted through those streets. Is this done without any lookouts or is there someone down the road keeping an eye on intersections?
AdrenalinePorn,2s16pm,moistmatt,4,Sun Jan 11 17:44:48 2015 UTC,"We don't usually have look outs but we do wait for the first block to clear of any traffic. As we go down, if the intersection looks too busy or a car is crossing, we just stop at the crosswalk and usually head back up to the beginning of the run. It's amazing how much control you have over your speed on these boards."
AdrenalinePorn,2s16pm,sfchillin,2,Sun Jan 11 20:33:18 2015 UTC,So much fun. which run did you do? The wiggle is pretty fun- from haight to the mission. Mostly downhills and a hell of a good time.
AdrenalinePorn,2s16pm,sfchillin,2,Sun Jan 11 07:47:26 2015 UTC,hey man I just moved here. could you tell me the actual cross streets for the start and finish of the wiggle? how bout some other runs? i'm in the marina but would venture anywhere in the city.
AdrenalinePorn,2s16pm,sfchillin,3,Sun Jan 11 09:07:41 2015 UTC,http://www.bicyclechica.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/route-wiggle.jpg I believe this is it. But a nice simple rund where you can get decent speed and little traffic is in golden gate park. Start aroun 23rd ave then get into the park and a good starting point is right under the bridge near the waterfall then head down to the beach and catch the muni up and do it again.

AdrenalinePorn,2rekfc,Gmackowiak,1 point,Tue Jan 6 22:44:00 2015 UTC,he's the dot in the middle of the bright snow toward the top you see the snow he's kicking up.
AdrenalinePorn,2rekfc,javoss88,8,Tue Jan 6 00:41:10 2015 UTC,How is he not just falling? That looks like a 90 degree angle.
AdrenalinePorn,2rekfc,Lazrath,3,Mon Jan 5 17:51:04 2015 UTC,I think just the same thing whenever I see videos of people skiing down slopes like this.
AdrenalinePorn,2rekfc,Hovsky,4,Mon Jan 5 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"the steeper the angle the easier it is for the ski edge to cut into the snow, well a skier/snowboarder on that slope basically would be falling, but by making turns you can manage your descent speed, avoid obstacles, etc."

AdrenalinePorn,2r8gwo,GoodGuyRick,2,Sun Jan 4 12:18:50 2015 UTC,I've had an interest in ground launching my skydiving canopy. Any tips?
AdrenalinePorn,2r8gwo,jaetman,4,Sun Jan 4 03:23:13 2015 UTC,"Probably my advice would be leave it and get a proper wing, I do skydive as well, although I'm less experienced as a skydiver so I've never jumped a wingload higher than about 1.15.  Generally skydiving canopies don't even come close to speedwings on glide, so you'd be looking for a very steep site and a reasonable (10-18mph) headwind on launch. The speedflying reference guide will give you more info than I can in a reddit comment, but ideally just meet up with some of your local flyers, wherever that may be. Regardless, this sort of stuff will kill or injure you right quick if you don't take it seriously, so get someone to mentor you :)"
AdrenalinePorn,2r8gwo,Xelol,2,Sun Jan 4 12:51:04 2015 UTC,"Me too. Brian Germain has an article about it (on mobile so no link), but I'm not going to do it unless I have someone competent to instruct me. I'm going to do a speedfly course someday, and maybe down the road after that I'll have the confidence to ground launch my skydiving canopy."

AdrenalinePorn,2qej84,careslol,2,Fri Dec 26 06:43:03 2014 UTC,South Point was my favourite experience of living on the island. The whole island is breathtaking but there's nothing comparable to jumping into the Big Blue and staring into the horizon on the way down.

Same deal, except waves cut out a huge hole in the cliff and when a swell crashed inside, water spit out of the top of the hole, thus the name. I decided to jump somewhere else.   Jumping from South Point isn't that bad. I didn't jump because I had broken a few vertebrae earlier that year and didn't want to aggravates the injury. There is a good spot to climb back up the cliff 25-50ft to the right, facing the cliff if the ladder is scary."

AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,123kij,1 point,Tue Dec 23 16:27:50 2014 UTC,Anyone here gotten into paragliding?  Any comparisons to other adventure sports?
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,aimhelix,1 point,Tue Dec 23 22:40:51 2014 UTC,"I did. My only other experience was skydiving and hang gliding. Skydiving was great but expensive and to be honest I don't like free fall as much as canopy time. Hang gliding is great fun but I didn't finish the course and lugging the gear around was a pain where I live. Pg is relaxed, soaring and something I really got into only because I think flying is more for me."
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,123kij,1 point,Wed Dec 24 08:47:48 2014 UTC,Thanks.  How did you get into PG initially?  Can you just do an intro jump like in skydiving and go from there if you like it?
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,aimhelix,1 point,Thu Dec 25 18:28:30 2014 UTC,"I did a lot of research. You can sign up for a tandem ride if you want to see if the experience is for you, or you can do an intro day where you learn the basics on day 1 and maybe do small glides off a bunny hill. I recommend doing that as it will introduce you to your local club and instructors. A good place to start is http://www.ushpa.aero/, from there you can learn about the sport and help find your local school and flight parks. Also, come visit us over at r/freeflight!"
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,123kij,1 point,Thu Dec 25 19:32:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I think the first option is for me. Not sure it's something I want to get serious about but definitely want to try it at least once."
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,aimhelix,1 point,Thu Dec 25 22:40:19 2014 UTC,Hell yeah! Good for you. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,123kij,1 point,Thu Dec 25 23:26:41 2014 UTC,"Sure, if you don't mind discussing the range of costs associated with the sport?  Training, equipment, licensing.  You mentioned that skydiving is expensive so I'm assuming PG is significantly cheaper?    I imagine that it would be better to do a tandem ride somewhere with a good landscape to start.  Unfortunately I think it's mostly plains and boring views out east where I'm at but maybe it's something I'd schedule on my next vacation somewhere nice."
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,aimhelix,1 point,Fri Dec 26 00:32:53 2014 UTC,"I live in the East Coast myself, you'd be surprised what they have here :) We have some mountains, though not as grand as those out west, and we can do towing as well to get some height. As far as expenses go, i did say Skydiving is expensive simply because of the airfare to get enough jumps to do say, wingsuits. You can become a certified PG pilot and get your own gear anywhere from 4k to 6k, (maybe cheaper) if you opt to get used gear after schooling. Classes to get you a P2 (license required to do solo) will cost you anywhere from 1500ish to 2000 dollars but that mostly depends on the school. I live in the city, so a small cost addition for me is the gas money I need to drive 2hrs to my fly site. The most expensive thing however is time. This sport requires commitment.. mostly weekends and such so be prepared for that if you ever get into it :)."
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,123kij,1 point,Fri Dec 26 02:56:39 2014 UTC,"One more question then I'll shut up and start using Google.  With skydiving, after you get your license, I believe you have to jump every so often to main your status, is it the same with PG?  The time requirements are definitely something to consider."
AdrenalinePorn,2q6ozu,aimhelix,1 point,Fri Dec 26 05:50:13 2014 UTC,"No problem, but with PG, there is no need per se to keep your certification. However, most, if not all pilots will tell you that its best that you fly often (at least kite the wing often) so you don't forget the feel of your wing. PG is more aviation than sport. The more you practice, you better you will be at safely launching, thermalling and landing."

I literally had water up to my shins and made sure my feet were steady so as not to slip down.”  Good weather was on their side—the expedition only saw two days of rain the entire trip. ""The light was perfect that day, and the rainbow was coming and going. When Lars dropped in, I saw that the rainbow was there, but also that another one had just appeared on the left,” says Heurteau. “I quickly checked my camera's LCD screen to see if all this was true, but with the sun I couldn’t see clearly. The boys were rushing me to go down and continue the run. This was literally the start of the lower section, and we had a lot more to paddle through. I couldn’t wait to get back to the van and put all the shots on the laptop.”  Heurteau photographed with a Canon 5D Mark III and an f/2.8, 16-35mm.   almost 1600x1200 version"

AdrenalinePorn,2pj7g1,smoqueed,5,Wed Dec 17 02:29:39 2014 UTC,uh... except maybe not letting go of the sled until it's below you? As you can see he hits the brakes changing his rotation forward so it allows him to exit above the sled.  if the sled were to end up above him(like it was about to before he adjusted) there's almost no way he could've gotten his chute out.. not saying the whole destroying a sled thing is cool but that was way riskier than a ski base
AdrenalinePorn,2pj7g1,Anti_Venom02,3,Wed Dec 17 03:51:05 2014 UTC,"I agree defiantly a riskier jump. As for the clean up i can see why it's a bad thing, but if you watch the video they defiantly do make a solid attempt to get a majority of the debris out.  Also, it's not like he did this jump just because he wanted to, he did it to honor his friend who had recently died and thought that riding his snowmobile off a 800 ft cliff would be the perfect way to honor him."

AdrenalinePorn,2p817j,shanemitchell,5,Sun Dec 14 18:16:30 2014 UTC,"Yup, base jumpers actually need several hundred regular jumps to get their license. What they acquire is the knowledge and experience how to steer clear of said cliff. Just opening your chute next to a cliff might save you, but more likely it's going to prop you up on an outcrop 500m up with a broken back from a pendulum against the wall.

AdrenalinePorn,2oaiuc,bingobangoben,26,Thu Dec 4 21:12:06 2014 UTC,"No risk. The risk of GLOC (g-induced loss of consciousness) exists when you're pulling gs in the z-axis (the up and down axis, like rapidly pulling back on the stick in an airplane). This causes the blood to leave the head and pool in the legs which is not so good for wakey-wakey. This guy is experiencing acceleration in the x-axis (forward and back) and as a result there's really no risk of gloc."
AdrenalinePorn,2oaiuc,GoldenSchauer,2,Fri Dec 5 00:18:35 2014 UTC,Is there a  G-force that will cause you to blackout before killing you in this position?
AdrenalinePorn,2oaiuc,FearTheCron,9,Fri Dec 5 05:15:04 2014 UTC,"I'm no flight physiologist (someone who might know the answer to this question), but if I had to guess I'd say that you would die before g-locing in this position. If I recall correctly there were tests done by the airforce to see how gs would affect the human body. A guy strapped himself to a rocket-sled on a train track and hit has high as 40g (same body position as this parachutist). He had all sorts of fucked upped injuries like detached retinas, but I don't recall him losing consciousness.

AdrenalinePorn,2oaiuc,runningman88,11,Fri Dec 5 19:18:15 2014 UTC,"Most people can withstand several G's if it is only over a really small time span. It's large amount of G's over extended periods of time that cause the blood to leave your brain causing you to ""black out"". Or inversely get too much blood to your brain causing a ""red out""."
AdrenalinePorn,2oaiuc,Officer_Squarepants,9,Thu Dec 4 21:32:51 2014 UTC,The amount of G's this guy experienced aren't strong enough to make you pass out. Also that only usually occurs after a couple seconds exposed to the G forces(IIRC it's around 5g's for the average healthy/fit person)
AdrenalinePorn,2oaiuc,Gradual_Bro,2,Thu Dec 4 21:51:15 2014 UTC,"I'm no professional here so someone else really should chime in, but Ithe problem with G's and passing out as I understand it is blood pooling and not circulating, which is why it happens in extended climbs/banks.   My real concern here would be whiplash."

AdrenalinePorn,2nz2g8,BASE1530,2,Tue Dec 2 15:48:54 2014 UTC,"Generally I stay away from MB because I don't like jumping with a lot of people because of the madness that ensues.  I didn't hit the wall hard, in fact the only thing that touched it was my foot, it just hit awkwardly and broke a few metatarsals.  I could have done better, but it could have been worse.    My body opened up so squarely to the 180 that I didn't realize it was a 180 until I went for my toggles, didn't feel them in the usual place and then looked up. When it's 2 seconds 'til collision, that was a waste of valuable time."

I didn't do too well half the time I was there and big fall hurt my confidence (and my knees) pretty bad, only got it back on the last run on the last day I was there for a really good run (typical!). So take what I say with a pinch of salt. Avoid the lowest green run (well, avoid all the green runs if you're on board, haha) there as it becomes chewed up chunks of ice pretty quickly. I only mention that because it's the one that joins everything together if that makes sense.  Conditions can be fierce up there, there's a thing that the locals say that is ""If you can ski in Scotland, you can ski anywhere"" and I can see what they mean by that. If you go expecting something different and don't expect perfect pow and conditions like you're more likely to get in Alps resort then you'll have fun. If you want those perfect conditions, stick to the Alps. Also in the early season it's really hit or miss as to whether the resorts will be open due to too much snow (I'm not kidding, they have to dig out lifts, buildings and car parks from big snow drifts every morning) so expect to be checking their Facebook page every morning, haha. Or just go later in the season and this shouldn't be a problem. You can get up there and do it really cheap though. Accommodation only cost me £100 for a week and day tickets are pretty cheap."
AdrenalinePorn,2n9p54,fixx0red,2,Mon Nov 24 18:38:58 2014 UTC,"Excellent, thanks a lot for the reply dude. I think I'll definitely give it a go. Maybe even this season if I can find something short notice... I'll take your advice on board and forget the lowest green haha. That does sound really cheap though, compared to the Alps it's pocket change. The quality obviously won't be as good but in my view a day on the board is miles better than a day off the board, so anything is good :D"
AdrenalinePorn,2n9p54,vtjohnhurt,1 point,Wed Nov 26 20:18:11 2014 UTC,"No problem! Glad I could help. A few of the resorts up there (Nevis Range and Cairngorm Mountain the most) are really trying to step things up to give the UK some really good resorts, which is cool, so you'd be supporting that!  Yeah, a lot of the green runs at Cairngorm are basically dirt/gravel roads in summer so they have flat sections in, which is fine for skiers, but not boarders, haha."

I recognise that wing suits glide/descend at a high speed and pretty steep angle, but is there enough control to be able to extend the wing wider or drop the trailing edge to spill speed and gain lift without stalling into a tumbling fall? Seems to me these guys fly on a knife edge, but there must be a means to flare up and deploy the chute. Otherwise these flights would be even more foolhardy than they look."

AdrenalinePorn,2n3s8q,vtjohnhurt,20,Sat Nov 22 20:53:29 2014 UTC,Im not sure I understand why on this subreddit I always see this type of comment.  You are in a subreddit based on doing things that could kill you/ seriously injure you to achieve an adrenaline rush.    The fact you could die is a huge reason why it's so exhilarating.
AdrenalinePorn,2n3s8q,collinisballn,2,Sat Nov 22 21:27:47 2014 UTC,"The several times that I've come very close to dying in sports, I felt extremely calm, rational and clear-headed in the moment.  Afterwards, I felt numb and psychologically traumatized.  On many more occasions, I experienced what I'd call an 'adrenaline rush' in sport; euphoric, extremely excited and it lasts for a while past the moment, BUT I was not really in mortal danger.  I was not scared shitless.  I think that folks who seek out an 'adrenaline rush' from placing themselves in mortal danger are a special breed.  Not to put a negative connotation on that breed, but they are like the alcoholic who gets that fantastically high buzz from a drink.  Non-alcoholics, enjoy a drink, but the level of pleasure that they get from the drink is nothing like what it does for the alcoholic.  Likewise, the extreme athletes who place themselves on the mortal edge are different from the majority of people who stand a few steps back from that edge.  So I'd say that people who enjoy a good adrenaline fix belong in this subreddit, even if they don't enjoy or seek out that 'almost died' experience.  People who want to go up to the edge of their lifespan belong here too, but I don't see any problem with calling out an exploit as being a bit edgy."

AdrenalinePorn,2n3s8q,Annall,2,Sun Nov 23 08:51:37 2014 UTC,"You asked...pinned inside a collapsing glass squirt kayak , braced on the bottom of the river with my paddle (to keep my head above water) and wrapped around Snaggle Tooth rock on Lower Railroad rapid on the New River in West Virginia.  After a few minutes, an eight person raft came down the rapid, I let go of my paddle, tried to grab the front rope of the raft and the momentum of the raft pulled me and the kayak up and over the rock.  Landed upside down in the eddy below the rock with the raft stuck on the rock in my place. A year earlier another kayaker had died on the exact same rock (I learned this a month later.)   WRT feeling calm and rational in the moment, I recall feeling the deck of the folded kayak pressing down hard on both of my thighs and calmly thinking, ""it's going to break both of my legs"", then I saw the raft coming towards me and I thought still quite calmly, ""No.  I'm going to drown first.""  I had no verbalized thought to let go of the paddle and grab the front of the raft, I just watched myself do it and the next thing I knew I was pulling my spray skirt off and wet exiting the boat in the eddy.  It was lucky timing. If I'd let go of the paddle a fraction of a second earlier, the kayak would have rolled my head under water and I would have been pinned between the rock and raft.  Game over.  Lower Railroad Rapid is a steep 10 foot 45 degree drop with Snaggle Tooth rock throwing up a rooster tail of water in the middle of it."

AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,onepennytoomany,2,Sat Apr 4 05:43:55 2015 UTC,It might be feasible to loop a rope through the webbing above and below the carabiner and tie it off. Probably safer to leave it undisturbed and hope though.

AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,SpeedflyChris,158,Wed Nov 12 10:28:10 2014 UTC,"I know my pulse went up as soon as I saw this. The image is originally from here: http://www.usppa.org/News/product_advisory.htm.   Thanks to Robin Rumbolt for sharing this picture of a very scary situation. This pilot was quite close to a catastrophic situation on two fronts. One, a significant bump that unloaded that riser could have caused the riser to come completely out, leaving the pilot spiraling uncontrollably down on the remaining side. Two, the carabiner has dramatically less strength and a strong updraft could break it.  The carabiner's labeling shows it can withstand 20 KN of force closed and 10 KN if loaded sideways but this model does not show what it would be if open. Many do as the picture below shows (courtesy Stefan Obenauer and www.canyoneering.net)."
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,azertyqwertyuiop,106,Tue Nov 11 21:03:53 2014 UTC,actually it's worse than that - loading a carabiner on the nose like that weakens it significantly beyond the open gate strength  http://blackdiamondequipment.com/en/qc-lab-weakness-of-nosehooked-carabiners.html

AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,evilhamster,23,Wed Nov 12 02:13:01 2014 UTC,"Pray it stays the fuck as it is, and doesn't slip or break. There's not a lot you can do at that point, until you can stop somewhere to relieve your weight from the gear and put everything safely in place and locked again.   This being paragliding, which I know nothing of, I've no idea how this would even be possible"
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,SpeedflyChris,27,Wed Nov 12 03:42:58 2014 UTC,"If you were ballsy enough, you could pull down on the risers above the carabiner to unweight it and try to use the other hand to seat it properly so that the gate can close. The challenge with this is that you're then putting a lot of weight on that one riser which would cause you to start to turn which adds a whole other variable to things.  Paragliders have reserve chutes though, so if all went south it wouldn't necessarily be death, but tossing a reserve has its own risks, namely that they're not steerable so you have no control over where you land.   Whether or not you'd chance it with trying to re-seat the riser on the carabiner, versus hoping that it holds the whole way down (reserves take 100-200+ feet to deploy at minimum, so if something happened below that height you'd be proper fucked), would be a tricky call to make."
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,leostotch,14,Wed Nov 12 04:19:36 2014 UTC,"Speedflyer here, we don't carry reserves, if I ever saw one of my carabiners like this I don't think I'd ever stop screaming."

AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,WinterCharm,23,Tue Nov 11 21:30:16 2014 UTC,"Yes, the pilot is in immediate danger. But:  There will be no spiral. Losing a riser is like letting go of a bedsheet that you held with both hands on opposing edges. You now have a flag in your remaining hand, the apparent direction of wind being terminal velocity of you dropping through the air.   Next, a strong updraft that breaks the open carabiner would need to exert something something 10 G on your Airfoil on that side alone to break the carabiner. Spread evenly over the whole canopy i'd guess the gust would deliver some 20-30 Gees. I'd reckon the canopy would tear first."

We found out when the rope slipped out fifty feet in the air. He tried to down-climb but slipped immediately. I managed to cushion his head and torso with my body, but he still shattered his leg. We are still close, but he quit climbing and I have a huge problem trusting new belayers. We'd been partners for two years, climbing at least twice a week. Familiarity can make you lazy...."

AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,yoodenvranx,14,Wed Nov 12 09:13:55 2014 UTC,We had a guy at my local climbing gym using an auto-belay on a ~30 foot wall.  Went up a bit.  Came down.  Unclipped.  Looked at the route.  Clipped in.  When up a bit.  Came down.  Unclipped.  Looked at the route a bit.  Clipped in.  Went up a bit.  Came down.  Unclipped.  Looked at the route a bit.  Went up almost to the top.  Fell down.  Broke ankle.
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,ticcev,7,Wed Nov 12 14:49:56 2014 UTC,Why would you unclip each time? Was the rope not long enough that he could stand at the bottom and look at the route without having to faff with unclipping each time?  Also... one broken ankle is pretty good going for falling almost from the top of a 30 ft wall...
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,deathguard6,2,Wed Nov 12 01:24:11 2014 UTC,"I think he was letting other people use the auto-belay in between.  I didn't see it happen, only heard the story and saw the new warning signs they'd put up.  Yeah I was surprised too. He did land on a pad intended for bouldering, probably why it wasn't way worse."
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,Patrik333,10,Wed Nov 12 02:04:54 2014 UTC,"Triple checking is odd. I mean, I'm looking at it, if I miss it the first time the second and third are just as likely to be me looking at it on autopilot.  I have always relied on the buddy system: you check you, and then you check your buddy, you call out your checks. then you call out your go code.  The ritual of call and response, of self check and partner check becomes instinctive at some point, to the point where I would find myself calling out ""climbing"" when attempting unprotected bouldering problems. I have always taught my friends this system and I have never had an ""oh shit"" moment."
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,Patrik333,8,Wed Nov 12 04:10:47 2014 UTC,"Unfortunatley that's the only way some people will learn. For example drunk driving. I heard all the years that you should not do it and I never did. I did not really had a strong opinion about it because I was never in a situation wre anyone of my friends were driving drunk. Except for one night were I became quite drunk, decided that I still could drive and then somehow ended up in my bed without any memory of what happened.   Only this event switched my brain from ""meh, drunk driving is kind of stupid"" to ""under no circumstances will I ever drive again under the influence of alcohol""."
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,Patrik333,3,Wed Nov 12 02:49:39 2014 UTC,I had a climbing experience that forever drove triple-check-your-carabiner into my head. At the top of a route I'd clipped into the anchors with a locking biner to set up my absiel and when I returned to unlock it to descend I found I hadn't locked it in the first place. Realizing I'd forgotten such a basic and essential safety check really affected me more than you'd expect and I've never experienced another lapse.  Another day I missed an anchor on a sport route and discovered it when I reached the next anchors. I would have easily hit the deck had I fallen and my belayer never noticed or mentioned it. That one taught me to watch out for myself and not depend on my belayer too much.
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,TheRevachanist,2,Wed Nov 12 11:06:30 2014 UTC,more often than not your belayer can not see all the bolts on a climb anyway
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,Kid_Falco,2,Wed Nov 12 18:10:55 2014 UTC,"That's stupid. If you don't think you need to triple check something that might save your life, then that is carelessness.   Sure, hopefully every single time you go to triple check your carabiner it'll be good and technically you'll not have 'needed' to check it on that particular time, but before you have checked that it's good, you don't know for sure.  The stories in this thread are all from climbers who thought they were very careful, but just had a mental slip one time. If you think you're so careful, then you're probably only about as careful as them unless you're not human."

AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,Tahns,25,Wed Nov 12 04:20:26 2014 UTC,"I was always under the impression that it was ok to have a single locking 'biner for most things (Eg: your belay device), you can substitute it with two non-locking 'biners with opposing gates in certain cases (Eg: top rope anchor).  However in the case of something like an anchor you often want multiple redundant pieces of gear and tying them all to a single carabiner isn't a good idea."
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,mfizzled,7,Wed Nov 12 04:18:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about : simple locking biner for belay device, but double when you get lowered from an anchor with a figure of 8 on a bight..."
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,ThaBlobFish,5,Wed Nov 12 11:03:39 2014 UTC,If you have a single tie in point it is perfectly acceptable to use a single locking 'biner. The reason you don't see it much is because you often have two bolts at the top while sport climbing and you don't want two slings attached to the same locking biner since you then have 3 directions loaded (which is bad with a carabiner).
AdrenalinePorn,2m04ai,leostotch,1 point,Wed Nov 12 15:21:00 2014 UTC,"One big consideration is being able to evaluate (and reach and monitor) the entire thing that you're connecting to.  I.e. your harness, belay device and belay biner are all kinda single-point-failure things. But they're right there so if for some reason your harness starts to become a little loose or the belay biner's screw-lock starts coming loose you can (hopefully) do something about it. And they're things that you know about and can evaluate - you use a nice biner that you're confident in, if you've spilled something that might or might not be acid on the harness, or its just old and sketchy, you trash it, etc. A failsafe is still good but in terms of a second belay biner and belay device, its just not very practical, unfortunately.  On the other hand, bolts just go into the rock. You don't really know how long they've been there, how long they are, how well they're stuck in place, if they're rusted or not, etc. And nobody has x-rayed the rock for fractures. And while you're hanging below an anchor, you can't reach it or maybe even see it. So the double security is kinda more mandatory given all the unknowns, inaccessibility, and inability to monitor."

AdrenalinePorn,2lv8ws,AwkwardCow,1 point,Mon Nov 10 21:11:06 2014 UTC,"Heck yeah dude...First time I went skydiving, it was a tandem jump since you need a license and all that to skydive alone here.  When he opened the plane door, and got to the edge, I had the deer in the headlights look and was screaming bloody murder to go back!!  But I had no control because my legs were out of the plane!  And then he jumped and I was like ""OH SHITTTTT!!!!!!!!!""  for a moment I truly felt like this is what it must be like to be suicidal and jumping off a building.  To be helpless and regret taking the leap and have no recourse.  But then my instructor stabilized us and it was all fun from there."

AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,JMC813,29,Sun Nov 9 20:50:12 2014 UTC,"hobie catamaran sailing, known by most as the hobie cat. i would say you can get started with a decent used hobie 16 (my personal favorite to sail, although not what i own) for around $2,000.  I've worked at a summer camp on keuka lake, NY for the past 8 years which is where i really learned how to sail these beasts, but i started out on a sunfish like most sailors. A hobie is bigger, and a hell of a lot faster, but really not much more complicated to sail.  here's a bonus pic of me flying high on a 16 that i put together from a bunch of used boat parts, so you can kinda see the difference in boat..  http://i.imgur.com/2QKJuNg.jpg"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,Shasve,6,Sun Nov 9 21:30:27 2014 UTC,$2000 seems extremely cheap for something like that.
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,boredatofficeman,9,Mon Nov 10 12:51:33 2014 UTC,because they're usually 20-30 years old...new ones are $15k+ with a trailer

AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,JohnnyCannuck,4,Sun Nov 9 22:55:54 2014 UTC,I would say that lasers (monohaul) are very good boats to learn with. Very simple and fairly cheap. They are also high fairly quick and you can learn how to handle speed and even do what is in the picture. I have been sailing my whole life and it has always been a great way to relax and see new places. I encourage anyone to give it a try.
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,johnyutah,3,Mon Nov 10 03:53:00 2014 UTC,"Start with a laser%) or a sunfish%), and you'll get the hang of it in no time. There's some vocabulary to learn, but that's easy, the most important part is knowing the basic knots and getting out there in the wind. I don't know any online resources for this because I learned to sail as I grew up, but any basic how2sail book should be more than enough to get you going unless you want to control a yacht :D  Get yourself a small stable sailing dinghy, and go enjoy the sea. Like /u/dglaw said, it's a very unique experience  e: fuck these links I have no idea"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,doopercooper,1 point,Wed Nov 12 12:57:35 2014 UTC,"Hey fellow sailor with 6 years dinghy experience. I fully agree with Hobbie 16's being great boats, however, I would not reccomend a catamaran to learn to sail on. I have my instructor qualifications, and most catamarans, have a lot more things to consider, when on the water. Such as the mast pivoting, and getting stuck in the wind. I would recommend a Laser or Laser Radial (depending on your physical size), as a first boat. It is barebones, perfect for learning easiest boat to sail imo, and goes quick. Most importantly I would recommend going to a local yacht club and signing up for sailing lessons PM me for more questions if any."

AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,alcoslushies,13,Mon Nov 10 07:02:58 2014 UTC,How do you know how far you can push it before it tips over? At what point is it out of your control?
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,PotatosAreDelicious,30,Sun Nov 9 22:14:36 2014 UTC,"i guess its comparable to doing a wheelie on a bike, there's a spot where the balance is perfect, and if you hold that lean it feels really easy, but any further than that and you'll end up on your ass.   i dumped a hobie probably half a dozen times before i started getting the feel for flying and only 2 or 3 times since then. also i can't do a wheelie on a bike."
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,doopercooper,10,Sun Nov 9 22:48:58 2014 UTC,Wheelies are scary cause its concrete your ass lands on not water.... not that water doesn't hurt too.
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,doopercooper,5,Mon Nov 10 00:51:18 2014 UTC,"Wheelies are easy cause once you tip past the point of return your feet can just slip off and hit the ground before your butt, and you can run it off.  Source: I ride BMX"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,_rainman_,3,Mon Nov 10 10:49:02 2014 UTC,Yeahhhhh.... Can't really run if off on a streetbike since you are going a lot faster.
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,dglaw,1 point,Mon Nov 10 16:10:13 2014 UTC,"Does tipping it like this help you with sailing it as far as speed and control, or is it mainly just for fun?"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,McKenzieC,9,Mon Nov 10 03:12:44 2014 UTC,"all boats tip when the wind pushes its sails, its called ""heeling"", it just looks way cooler on a catamaran! since a boat moves forward by wind foiling off the sail and creating thrust, a tighter sail ='s more resistance against the wind, and the more speed/lean (""heeling""). not to mention, less surface area (drag) when 1/2 the boat is out of the water. its like channeling 170 square feet of wind power into something with about the same hydrodynamics as a canoe, and when the wind is upwards of 15 mph its a hell of a time"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,dglaw,3,Mon Nov 10 03:25:03 2014 UTC,"not to mention, less surface area (drag) when 1/2 the boat is out of the water.   Doesn't that platform you're standing on create a lot of drag in the water when it's tipped?"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,Bama011,3,Mon Nov 10 06:41:04 2014 UTC,"it does! well somewhat... you can't really feel it as the sailor, but i would be going a little faster in this shot if i was heeled a few degrees less and that wing was out of the water"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,Widespread_Panic,3,Mon Nov 10 17:06:53 2014 UTC,"Depends on the boat. Most boats with one hull are best sailed as flat as possible, or even leaning over on top of you, but boats with two or more hulls benefit from having less hull in the water to slow them down so you lean them over"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,416IsGreaterThan647,1 point,Mon Nov 10 04:22:28 2014 UTC,Depends on the boat honestly. Some boats are made so they can easily recover from capsized while others sink like rocks. It's all a part of learning though

AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,Makrja,3,Sun Nov 9 19:56:39 2014 UTC,"its a hobie 17, a discontinued model. it can have a jib but the modification kit is really pricey. i've never heard of one with a spinnaker but hobies FX One (their new 17' model) has all that jazz"

AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,TheJellyFox,1 point,Sun Nov 9 21:38:36 2014 UTC,"yea i know the fx one and wildcat are fiberglass, and built for performance. their rotomolded boats (such as the t2, getaway, bravo) are more of ""comfort cruisers"". they don't perform as well (as far as speed and bite when sailing upwind) but are REALLY easy to rig, and comfortable to sail. It seems their rotomolded boats are marketed towards beginners and retired sailor's, and their fiberglass boats are for your more aggressive sailor.  either way all cat's are fun to sail!"
AdrenalinePorn,2ls33w,TheJellyFox,1 point,Sun Nov 9 21:55:47 2014 UTC,"I like the rotomolded hulls  because I can pull it up on the beach with much less damage. From reading up on the FX I think it would preform pretty well, obviously not as well as a 16 or T2, but still a fast boat."

Their lives turn hell shitty when they lose their license, I'd hazard a guess and say it's around the same age they'd be out in a home by an uncaring family. So, to them it'd seem like everything's being taken away, and obviously no one wants to feel like that.  3: politicians themselves are getting on a bit, it's probably difficult to willingly handicap yourself later in life. Maybe there's the same sort of mentality involved with ""man. I've only had a couple drinks I'm right to drive"". People overestimate their abilities and it doesn't always end well."

AdrenalinePorn,2jqd4g,phigo50,1 point,Mon Oct 20 18:19:45 2014 UTC,"It's definitely an English thing, we can't blame murica for this one I'm afraid. If the word starts with a consonant sound then you use a, otherwise an.  The French (among others) do similar things with the spoken language (I mean, altering the end of the first word depending on how the second word begins) but they don't make the alteration in writing. You would pronounce the s in vous in the phrase vous allez (it kinda gets drawn into the second word so it would sound like voo-zallay when said properly) but not in vous faisez (voo-fay-zay). It makes it easier and more natural to say and you don't have to rearrange your extremely complicated speaking apparatus unnecessarily in between syllables.  excuse my awful phonetic representations"

AdrenalinePorn,2jqd4g,kvikklunsj,3,Mon Oct 20 16:45:33 2014 UTC,"OP is probably not a native speaker. I guess we all learn the simple rule that it's ""an"" instead of ""a"" in front of words starting with a vowel."
AdrenalinePorn,2jqd4g,Chameleon3,5,Mon Oct 20 23:23:28 2014 UTC,"I learned it like that at first, then I learned that it should be based on how the word sounds, not completely on how it's spelled. So for example, 'hour' doesn't start with a vowel, but since the h is silent and you basically say 'out', it should be prefaced with 'an'.     Does that make sense?  I guess there are some other rules to this, because 'usual' doesn't really sound like it starts on a consonant, right?"
AdrenalinePorn,2jqd4g,leostotch,1 point,Tue Oct 21 00:29:54 2014 UTC,"I think the phonetic method here is the most reliably correct; 'usual' starts with a 'y' sound, and in this case, the consonant version of 'y'."

AdrenalinePorn,2jqd4g,shedmonday,19,Mon Oct 20 11:38:41 2014 UTC,"Protip: the fact that ""usual"" starts with a vowel doesn't mean anything. It's all about the sound it makes. It results in weird things like ""an honor"" but ""a hospital."" Interestingly, you say ""a usual"" but ""an unusual"" because the U in un- makes a vowel sound.  Anything that starts with U but makes the ""yoo"" sound is like that. Uniform, unicycle, university. Words that start with O but make a W sound are the same. ""I'm going on a one-week vacation."" I'm not sure how many of those there are, though. ""One"" and ""once"" are the only examples that I can come up with.  Edit: fixed some stuff"

AdrenalinePorn,2jhewf,jrk-,2,Fri Oct 17 21:04:40 2014 UTC,"I'm just curious, but I've heard about this guy before. He seems to combine free climbing with base jumping. But, as far as I know (and I really don't have a clue) you need some minimum height to deploy the parachute. There are stories of base jumpers who estimated the drop wrong and didn't bother to open their chutes because they knew they were doomed. So, what I would like to know is how Dean Potter handles this minimum height? Or is he well aware that below 100 or 150 meters he could just plunge to death?"
AdrenalinePorn,2jhewf,phybere,2,Fri Oct 17 21:12:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, definitely don't fall close to the ground. It doesn't work very well on any section where there's slab or ledges either, you really have to be on something overhung for it to be at all useful.  I think he pretty much accepts that he's free soloing, say the 5.11 part of the route, then when he gets to the 5.13 overhung crux where he might fall the parachute is there to back him up."
AdrenalinePorn,2jhewf,ChickenDelight,6,Sat Oct 18 00:31:21 2014 UTC,"Yes, it is.    That exact shot is in a longer video from about the development of that rig, an ultralight emergency base-jumping chute, with help from a sponsor.  There was a whole series of shots, including that one, of him taking test falls on it, practicing getting away from the wall and using the chute under ideal conditions after ""missing"" a move.  At that time, he'd never taken an unplanned fall on the chute - which might have changed since then, but that particular shot was 100% planned."

AdrenalinePorn,2jhewf,plissk3n,12,Fri Oct 17 04:40:11 2014 UTC,For the lazy.  Why does it kills the sport? I think it was cool and pushes the boundaries and that's whats extreme sports are there for right?  Also is it real? They don't really show much material from the impact which is strange for such a record which is usualy filmed with a bazillion of gopros and other cameras.

You can either follow the trail, or take the steps along side the old tram track. It took us about an hour to climb the steps. After that its just a long hike with some elevation gain, 22km/14 miles round trip. I thought standing on the rock was going to be super intimidating, but it feels every bit as solid as the ground its attached to."

AdrenalinePorn,2j56j4,Deceased_Puppy,6,Tue Oct 14 14:59:26 2014 UTC,"Where I play locally (Sacramento, CA):   350 fps MAX for pistols (no minimum engagement distance)  360 fps MAX for SMGs (must also be a replica of a real SMG, 5 foot minimum engagement distance)  400-450 fps MAX for non-sniper primaries (15 - 20 foot minimum engagement distance)  550 fps MAX for sniper rifles (100 foot minimum engagement distance)  Range wise varies a lot due to many factors such as barrel length, hop-up/barrel quality, BB weight, and many other things. My overall average engagement is about 75 feet but the guns can shoot 200+ feet. There are always the ridiculously far shots but after 200-300 feet its more of a luck thing in my opinion."
AdrenalinePorn,2j56j4,Deceased_Puppy,3,Mon Oct 13 21:44:08 2014 UTC,Is it like paintball? If you get shot are you out or are you just tryna sting other fuckers
AdrenalinePorn,2j56j4,bobdolebobdole,9,Mon Oct 13 21:58:58 2014 UTC,"Its like paintball in that sense, one hit and you are out. Though when you are hit it leaves no visible mark (i.e. paint splatter) so its based on an honor system, which some people don't always follow unfortunately."
AdrenalinePorn,2j56j4,Beastydrummer,5,Mon Oct 13 23:04:01 2014 UTC,"It's very different from paintball in that paintball is played more as a sport. Airsoft is more of a simulation. I've played competitive paintball, as you progress in that sport it becomes apparent that it is nothing like real combat at all. When we would play recreational games on non-tournament style courses (the ones that look like real life scenarios, out in the woods, etc.) it became even more apparent that playing it like a simulation we a disadvantage. We'd just use the same tactics as in a regular match because that is the most efficient way to play paintball.  I'm not trying to knock on Airsoft it's just a very different game. Paintball feels much more sport-like at the highest levels, and Airsoft is more of a simulation. What causes this is definitely the rules in place for each game. There were times when just for fun we'd change the rules of a match to make it more like a simulation in paintball, and there are times in practice when we'd run specific drills that honed our skills for tournaments.  The most realistic simulation I've seen would be the gunfights with simunitions firearms from pistol and carbine courses. These are real firearms using realistic cartridges, that fire soap/plastic bullets, using real gunpowder, but at a lower velocity. Even with safety equipment it looks intense as fuck. Simunititions guns being real firearms have realistic trajectories and recoil, and realistic magazine capacities, with a lot more adrenaline to boot."
AdrenalinePorn,2j56j4,The_Uber_Dude,2,Tue Oct 14 01:42:22 2014 UTC,"Range should be primarily dependent on muzzle velocity, which is the speed at which the BB exits the barrel. The barrel length doesn't affect range, I know it seems like it should, but it really doesn't. BB weight would help combat air resistance so it would affect range as well. But if two guns shoot the same BB (same inertia), at with the same length of barrel the one that has a higher muzzle velocity will send a BB farther. If one gun has a longer barrel but lower muzzle velocity the one with higher muzzle velocity will still travel farther.  Because BB's are spheres and not conical in shape, they won't gain or lose stabilization by changes in a barrel's length. The qualities of the barrel that affect stabilization of the BB would be consistency of the muzzle (is the crown of the barrel damaged or clean?) and is the straightness of the barrel. A damaged crown or warped barrel could give a BB a spin which would affect trajectory and possibly range.  Given the same trajectory angles, same BB weight, same air conditions, the only real factor in range would be the muzzle velocity. It boils down to physics. Barrel length could affect the muzzle velocity, but it's not the main thing affecting range, because with good engineering a gun could be designed to have a higher or lower muzzle velocity with a given barrel length."
AdrenalinePorn,2j56j4,Dullbert,3,Tue Oct 14 01:53:04 2014 UTC,"True, though airsoft guns have hop-up's in them which give spin to the BB on purpose. That's one of the greatest factors in range for airsoft guns of equal velocity."

Alternatively, you can add on #t=x where x is the number of seconds into the video. So the link would be  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpYvi6Rg24E#t=190  Just for future reference. :)"

AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,hatmantop,8,Mon Oct 6 02:32:32 2014 UTC,question: how do you manage to stop yourself while going at this speed? other than just jumping off and hoping for the best
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,Waddupp,12,Fri Oct 10 04:03:42 2014 UTC,"Slide. Imagine crouching down and kicking out the board toeside, hands down into kind of a pushup. You need gloves with what looks like a hockey puck on the palm."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,frank3000,10,Mon Oct 6 02:21:43 2014 UTC,"Powerslide. Turn the board side ways and slide on the wheels for like 20 feet, and do that periodically till you've slowed down enough to hop off"
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,McKushin,6,Mon Oct 6 03:03:48 2014 UTC,"You can actually also do standing slides, where you don't need gloves. Quite a bit more difficult to control at that speed, but that's another relatively safe out for an advanced rider that's not wearing his gear."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,themanwillbeborn,-7,Mon Oct 6 03:00:05 2014 UTC,"You can even do it gloveless with your hands down as long as you don't put any real weight on your hands. Think halfway between a standup and a handsdown. I do this regularly, even though it's super fucking unadvisable."

AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,Daveyd325,-30,Mon Oct 6 05:28:28 2014 UTC,More like you're a dumbass for talking about things that you don't have the slightest knowledge of. Any longboard rider with the balance to ride at that speed is also very likely to be adept at sliding and/or foot-braking. Neither of which are very hard activate and go from any speed to 0 within about 20 feet.
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,themanwillbeborn,26,Mon Oct 6 00:53:00 2014 UTC,"Well there isn't a way to counter your obviously well written argument without sounding like a dick, but I've been skating for about 4 years now and been doing downhill for 3 of them. This guy has no gear, fucktard, he could have killed himself. He doesn't know how to tuck, fucktard, that means he never planned on getting that much speed. He made pedestrians move, fucktard, it's because he couldn't stop himself. He's the guy that gets skating banned everywhere because he shoves his empty fucking skull into the side of some families minivan, then people like you defend him because ""It wasn't his fault""."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,NecesitoSubaru,-21,Mon Oct 6 06:40:47 2014 UTC,"Nobody ITT is talking about his personal safety. What gear he wears and whether he lives or dies is on him and I don't know how you interpreted my comment to mean that if he falls and cracks his skull it wouldn't be his fault. Maybe because you're getting so worked up? Try to remove your emotion from the equation and focus on the argument.  My argument was that if he's balancing at that speed, along with comfortably throwing up hand gestures to the pedestrians and/or in general.. Then he is probably an advanced rider. You counter this by saying that he's not tucking so therefore he's not advanced, and I'd disagree. Just because he's not tucking doesn't mean that he doesn't know how to to, and tucking is not a required part of every downhill ride. He didn't ""make"" pedestrians move, he kept riding to see if they would, and they did, so he went through. If they didn't, he could have shut down with a foot-brake or a slide. There's nothing to indicate your assertion that he never planned on getting that much speed, and I still maintain that he likely had the foot-braking/sliding abilities to come to a stop if he really needed to. The vast majority of riders who can show that kind of comfort (eg - not wobbling and throwing their balance all over the place) at those speeds possess those skills, and there's no reason to assume that he doesn't."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,themanwillbeborn,9,Mon Oct 6 00:43:27 2014 UTC,"He is obviously wobbling right before getting to them so why is that your only argument? And yes, tucking is necessary."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,NecesitoSubaru,-14,Mon Oct 6 02:20:51 2014 UTC,"You call that amount of wobbling after clearing a path of pedestrians an indication that he's a novice rider and thus doesn't have the stopping ability to shut down that speed? Give me a break. It was a very nominal amount of wobble that is to be expected when throwing your hands up, even for an advanced rider. He handled it just fine. And no, tucking is not a 100% prerequisite to every down hill ride. Maybe you tuck on every. single. hill. you go down, but there are plenty of rides where it's not necessary whatsoever."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,themanwillbeborn,7,Mon Oct 6 04:14:03 2014 UTC,"I really don't feel like fighting over the fucking internet, believe what you want honestly. But I wouldn't plan on seeing this guy at literally any IGSA races, maybe a hospital though."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,NecesitoSubaru,3,Mon Oct 6 00:51:05 2014 UTC,"Powerslide or foot braking - the latter is where you drag one foot on the ground to slow down. You have to be REALLY careful about your balance and application of pressure, and it fucks the soles of your shoes beyond belief."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,masaoshigeta,0,Mon Oct 6 00:55:24 2014 UTC,"Going that fast and stopping by trying to put your foot on the road is suicide. You eventually just slow down, or try to powerslide like you said but if you mess up doing that, you're gonna eat shit"
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,BigM1,2,Mon Oct 6 01:03:23 2014 UTC,"As long as you ease into the braking, it's fine. You basically have to start with your foot on the ground with 0 weight, then just slowly put your foot down more and more. I find it safer than powersliding at high speed as long as you're not on a huge incline."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,masaoshigeta,4,Mon Oct 6 01:06:02 2014 UTC,You can slide. Check out /r/longboarding for examples. Although gloves and a helmet would definitely improve this he's chances.

AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,Your_Gonna_Hate_This,-2,Mon Oct 6 06:45:59 2014 UTC,"Its a difference in community attitude mostly.  The long board community champions the ability to skate safe with controlled slides and safety gear.  We actually don't care a whole lot what KIND of board you skate or how you skate it, just that you skate and enjoy."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,jetpig,0,Mon Oct 6 16:19:41 2014 UTC,"Also a difference in priorities, longboarders tend to focus more on gear and technical elements. Longboarding is a lot less ""edgy"" than skateboarding tends to be. Skateboarders are much less concerned with legality and safety than longboarders. Skateboarding has a stronger DIY ethic and more colorful history."
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,masaoshigeta,-2,Mon Oct 6 16:23:29 2014 UTC,a fair assessment.
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,jetpig,2,Sun Oct 5 23:51:34 2014 UTC,If you don't have to stop quickly you can start carving. That means doing kind of an S-pattern down the hill and slowing down that way. Stopping quickly at that speed requires a slide since footbreaking is way too unstable at high speeds. The slide can be performed standing up or with a hand on the ground. This guy didn't have slide gloves on so his only choice would have been to do a standing slide (powerslide). Slide tutorial
AdrenalinePorn,2ie1ab,Kahvikone,1 point,Mon Oct 6 02:03:49 2014 UTC,a rational skateboarder buys/makes gear and learns the techniques.to do a controlled slide to a stop at any time.  Look up Coleman slide or pendulum slide.

AdrenalinePorn,2i7r3e,CoopedUP,1 point,Sun Oct 19 15:32:23 2014 UTC,Yeah I'm actually gonna try that out first with my trainer kite once winter hits. Hopefully it gives me a nice transition for when I hit the water in the summer. Taking baby steps lol
AdrenalinePorn,2i7r3e,CoopedUP,1 point,Sun Oct 19 18:58:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, better to learn on the land on my opinion. It's really usefull to perfectly control your kite before going on the water.  Besides this point, including all the kite sports existing it's my favourite. You really have the bests feeling on the powder snow immaculate, going through the relief and all the obstacles of the mountain :)"

AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,Shnozberries,11,Thu Oct 2 22:55:46 2014 UTC,Umm does this adversely affect the amount of lift on the left wing?
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,Whoelseisbored,14,Thu Oct 2 23:10:29 2014 UTC,Probably have to steer a bit different like a car with one a low tire
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,ThisNameIsOriginal,1 point,Thu Oct 2 23:12:39 2014 UTC,"Sort of like that, but as I explained above, planes all have this thing called trim, it's essentially these small segments on the ailerons and rudder control surfaces that can be manipulated with either wheels or levers on the inside of the cockpit, varies depending on the plane, but they can be used to make small adjustments to the aircraft's pitch or yaw, often they're used to make small turns and such."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,oot-and-aboot,13,Wed Oct 29 19:56:51 2014 UTC,I'm surprised the plane still flies carrying those 10 tonne balls of steel!
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,kr0wb4r,2,Fri Oct 3 00:12:32 2014 UTC,"Was thinking the same thing. Probably not too much, but enough to change the feel of the plane. There would be the weight balance as well."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,MoronicOxy,2,Thu Oct 2 23:13:45 2014 UTC,"Yea for sure.  You just compensate with a little rudder and aileron.  It's not much worse than when a three skydivers are hanging off a C182 wing about to jump.  The angle of incidence on the outside of the wing is less so that wings stall at the roots first, so seeing how he's really close to the root, he still has tons of lift remaining on the wing."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,Adrenaline_,1 point,Fri Oct 3 13:10:15 2014 UTC,"Likely, but the pilot would just have to compensate with aileron trim."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,oot-and-aboot,-1,Wed Oct 29 19:52:37 2014 UTC,"Well, considering he's stalling the wing to perform this maneuver, don't think it's much of a problem. Also, as a jumper I've climbed out on the wing of a PAC-750 kinda like this before, no issue."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,lliebler,6,Fri Oct 3 01:54:00 2014 UTC,You're wrong.  He is absolutely NOT stalling the wing to perform this maneuver.  He is in full flight the whole time.  This is a standard aileron roll and it's done at high speed and nowhere near the critical angle of attack.
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,Adrenaline_,-1,Fri Oct 3 13:11:45 2014 UTC,"Touche. Just read up on it. Just looked was pitching up pretty good and for some reason I thought aileron rolls were done at least close to stall, but I guess I was thinking of hammerheads. Although now that I've read about those, that's not technically a stalled maneuver either."

AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,CubbyRed,5,Tue Oct 7 14:33:22 2014 UTC,"If he fell or jumped off, wouldn't he hit the tail?"
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,AdvCitizen,3,Tue Oct 7 16:04:35 2014 UTC,Just what I was thinking
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,cock-a-doodle-doo,3,Fri Oct 3 06:58:23 2014 UTC,No.  He'd fall.  It's just like when you jump out of a C182.
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,Adrenaline_,1 point,Fri Oct 3 09:41:42 2014 UTC,"From a C182 you exit much lower in respect to the tail section though(below the forward wing). You only have to clear maybe 2 feet before the tail section ""catches up"". Am I just thinking that these planes are going way faster than they are? edit:punctuation"
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,AdvCitizen,4,Fri Oct 3 13:12:54 2014 UTC,"I like your train of thought, but it's not correct.  The difference between a 182 and the plane you see here is that the 182 is a high-wing airplane and this is a low-wing airplane.  Therefore, being on top of the low wing is the same as being under the high wing.  The position of the actual skydiver when they leave the airplane, relative to the fuselage (and, more importantly, empennage) is exactly the same.  In both instances, you're jumping from about pilot level."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,Adrenaline_,2,Fri Oct 3 13:50:25 2014 UTC,"Thank you, good explanation."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,AdvCitizen,4,Fri Oct 3 13:52:31 2014 UTC,"I get it, but he does not look strapped in."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,retconk,9,Fri Oct 3 14:00:09 2014 UTC,He's got a skydiving rig. You can see the leg straps and the container on his back. I'm sure he eventually just jumped off.
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,nmoat,2,Fri Oct 3 01:06:42 2014 UTC,Well then it's not very risky right? I'm surprised there aren't more people who do this.
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,loulan,3,Fri Oct 3 01:57:26 2014 UTC,"I would totally do that if I found a pilot with a plane who wanted to take me up. I think the main issue is just that skydiving is already a very small, expensive sport, and doing things out of the ordinary is even more expensive."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,nmoat,2,Fri Oct 3 04:28:35 2014 UTC,"Depends if the pilot took off with him on the wing, in which case there would be time where even the parachute wouldn't help (not enough height vs time to deploy)."
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,coderqi,1 point,Fri Oct 3 06:10:02 2014 UTC,He didn't.  He opened the canopy in flight and crawled out.
AdrenalinePorn,2i4uja,Adrenaline_,2,Fri Oct 3 07:23:00 2014 UTC,Well most skydivers don't jump out of low wing 2-seater aircraft.

AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,Clubbing_A_Penguin,13,Fri Sep 26 16:32:47 2014 UTC,He might have pads under his pants.  It's pretty popular to do among longboarders.  Especially with pads called g - forms which fit very comfortably under clothes.
AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,eyeothemastodon,11,Fri Sep 26 17:57:43 2014 UTC,"G-forms are shit for sliding bails like this, they shred right up. They're more for impacts from more trick and air oriented sports."

AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,themanwillbeborn,2,Sat Sep 27 02:56:12 2014 UTC,"Here's how much flesh came off when he fell. Not wearing knees pads gives absolutely zero riding advantage, and at those speeds is just ridiculous. Every rider knows they are bound to fall. Cruising the streets at 15mph? Whatever. But when it comes to 50+ mph runs why some people think that scraping the skin to practically the bone is preferable to wearing knee pads is beyond me."
AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,picmip,2,Sun Oct 19 01:14:37 2014 UTC,"Getting in pretty late here, but I just wanted to say how fucking much I agree.   I used to inline speed skate and during practice, there was a long and smooth road we hadn't really skated down before, so we decide to try full speed which is about ~20-25mph on level ground and before we noticed a sharp turn that was impossible to slow down for or go straight, as going straight would probably meant having ended up in a pretty solid fence, there was literally no option but to brake as much as possible in less than 2 seconds and go for a knee slide and start rolling with no pads. I didn't walk properly, let alone skate, for the next 2 months even though I went into a roll as soon as possible. Got myself some ultra light kneepads after that for competition, although 95% of the people competing didn't use them for aerodynamics, which is ridiculous, really.  I can only imagine my experience at over twice the speed, even more ridiculous."

AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,relet,8,Fri Sep 26 14:18:09 2014 UTC,"Yes they do, but since they are optimized for going fast, not tricks, a lot of factors prevent them: larger wheels, lower center of gravity, wide axles, your stance (low, and your forward mass pulls the board out of wobbles). That list could go on for a while. One important thing is that you select the hardness of your axle rubbers based on the speed you expect to go. A downhill board tuned for 80kmh will hardly even turn if you don't have the centripetal force your speed brings you."
AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,notgod,8,Fri Sep 26 17:57:12 2014 UTC,"Yes, yes they are. I long boarded down a hill last year... I had a helmet, knee pads, gloves, etc. Only I forgot the gloves in my car.

AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,Clubbing_A_Penguin,2,Fri Sep 26 17:30:54 2014 UTC,There are parts made specifically for downhill longboarding that help keep speed wobbles to a minimum and different ways to position your body to make it more stable.

But risking a slide on asphalt without protection... I just can't make it compute.  It's like being at an anti-casino: you place a bet but if you lose a dude savages you with a belt sander."

He's likely got thousands of miles on his board OVER 45 mph.  We all acknowledge that things go wrong sometimes, and that sometimes there's nothing you can do about it.  It's part of the sport.  So I can understand choosing not to wear leathers, the no full face is the one that gets me, though.  theres an ever continuing discusion about safety choices in this sport and it generally comes down to a personally determined choice"
AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,bggp9q4h5gpindfiuph,1 point,Fri Sep 26 19:42:18 2014 UTC,"You're right, ""idiot"" is not quite the word. I guess my personal riskiness measuring stick got shortened, recently.  On the other hand, maybe he doesn't really care about roadrash the way plebes like me do. I am pretty anti-roadrash, speaking for myself, and risking going under a car is right out..."
AdrenalinePorn,2hixex,jetpig,2,Fri Sep 26 21:53:58 2014 UTC,After a certain point one is willing to take fewer precautions due to increased skill.  I have hills that when I started riding them I'd only do it in full leathers and everything and now i'm perfectly comfortable doing them in just a half shell and gloves. I also am conciously aware of the risks I'm taking along the way and that there will never be a time that the randomness of life isn't a risk.  I read a story recently of a kid who got real hurt when he hit a car in a blind corner where the car was in the wrong lane coming up the hill.

I wrecked at 110 mph years ago and your comment is reminding me just how extremely lucky I was. (BTW mine was due to a pothole filled with rain, I thought it was a puddle) A sprained ankle, a bunch of road rash, and a lot of money down the drain. You really don't understand how badly things can go until you experience things go badly. Unfortunately for me, and many others, it took being a dumb kid to learn the hard way and become a wiser adult.   That experience alone is still enough to make me not want to watch the video. I cringe thinking about anyone grinding their way to a halt on asphalt and, relatively, my experience wan't really that bad. Good luck to you."

I never got very good and haven't ridden in a couple years but I still follow it pretty closely.  It's amazing how far its come. Back when I started, people were talking about how half of these tricks wouldn't be possible on a board so big (compared to a skateboard).  Here's one of the best video parts from the early days: http://vimeo.com/61066202 from the film ""Sfumato"".

Basically a go-cart motor attached to a spool with a wakeboard rope and handle on it. You secure the device, walk the line out to where you want to start, then someone fires-up the winch and it pulls you back in.  Here's the one I built about 4 or 5 years ago:   View of the machine without a rope: http://i.imgur.com/I3lRmrm.jpg  ""Driver's"" view: http://i.imgur.com/5GYC5pz.jpg  It allows for some awesome spots to be accessed, not only great for wakeskating. A group of wakeboarders who call themselves ""Shredtown"" really push the limits while strapped in to a board: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fESyBn5NCZY  edit: REALLY sorry for the shitty tinypic hosting on those images.

The people here want to feel close to death, we want to deal with life-threatening situations, battling the elements to turn out on top, screaming at the top of our lungs, we want to feel 100mph wind in our hair while looking down on the world, we want to throw ourselves off of things our brain's tell us we shouldn't, we want to feel at one with the ultimate rush, depend on our equipment to save our lives and then look back at the top of the mountain, the clouds in the sky or far out at sea, and just be glad that we get to walk away from it.

Plus I've been working as a paid acrobat for years this kinda specialty act/show stands out because it is so different from everything thats out there. Take it to a night event where they wear glowing costumes and glow stick ropes and its an insane show. Pay isn't bad either for these kinds of gigs."

AdrenalinePorn,2gbfow,numpad,6,Sun Sep 14 06:47:21 2014 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from, but I think its only because you don't know the opportunities that jump ropers get compared to other sports.  We travel the world (mostly payed for) to compete, and to teach workshops and camps in part of the greatest community of people ever.  I know that it is not possible to get a scholarship for jump roping, but the odds of jump roping helping me get into college, or get a job are much much higher than athletes trying to get sports scholarships because of the leadership experiences and team activities we do.  Jump roping makes us stand out from other athletes."

AdrenalinePorn,2g6xcu,Ingenium21,17,Fri Sep 12 13:30:08 2014 UTC,"Start with skydiving.  Regular skydiving.  BASE takes a skillset that can only be gained through training out of a plane.  I haven't heard of anyone becoming a BASE jumper that didn't have a very healthy skydiving training.  Otherwise, you'll ""try"" it, might get lucky a few times and survive, but will certainly die MUCH sooner than later.  There is a LOT more to it than just ""pull your chute."""

AdrenalinePorn,2g6xcu,faaaaarkoff,2,Fri Sep 12 19:20:53 2014 UTC,"You have to know how to enter and hold a stable body position (arch), potentially track away a little (tracking takes training), either know how to pack your BASE gear (very different than skydiving rig) or have a competent person pack it for you, be very comfortable with BOC or just hold your pilot chute and know how to release it into the open air and not your burble, be very good at canopy skills in case you develop a half or full line twist, and be able to control your canopy quickly to arrive at your landing zone safely.  You have to know how to deal with a temporary pilot chute in tow if it happens as well as every canopy malfunction that might occur.  I'm missing a bunch of other stuff, but BASE is WAY more than just ""jump and pull."""

AdrenalinePorn,2g6xcu,Divune,6,Fri Sep 12 19:33:46 2014 UTC,"If you're thinking about BASE, go and get some skydiving in. Keep BASE in mind but concentrate hard on training your skills in sky diving untill you have a few hundred jumps. By then you'll have probably picked up enough knowledge of BASE on how to get started in it. It's a big commitment and shouldn't be taken lightly. But if you want to do it man, fuck yeah, go for it."

AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,closeted_hipster,8,Tue Sep 9 00:52:56 2014 UTC,"You, sir, have balls of steel.   I used to race Optimists as a kid and later Lasers as a youth. In a decent enough breeze the Laser would hydroplane on a good reach - there are few feelings better than that.  But hanging off the stern on a trapeze on a broad reach - maybe I'm just not the adrenalin junkie I used to be anymore, but that looks terrifying."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,bsurg,5,Tue Sep 9 03:55:33 2014 UTC,"Oh, it's not me in the picture, but believe me, I wish it were. The Contender is my dream boat. I have a soft spot for wooden boats; they're just so beautiful. You can even buy a set of official plans and build one yourself. A beautiful, sleek, homebuilt wooden boat with a trapeze and modern-day performance? Yes, please! Those Australians sure can build a boat."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,nigfart,2,Tue Sep 9 04:04:43 2014 UTC,Agreed. Wooden boats with the right finish are flawless
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,SubcommanderMarcos,3,Tue Sep 9 19:28:25 2014 UTC,"Hah dude, I miss my Optimist. That little box took 10-year old me everywhere in the bay."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,tdobson,9,Wed Sep 10 01:19:10 2014 UTC,"The International Contender is a high-performance dinghy designed by the legendary Australian designer Ben Lexcen in 1967. They can be made either of fiberglass or, as in the picture, of wood. Both types are equally fast, with wooden boats regularly winning championships."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,Jaiez,4,Tue Sep 9 00:56:01 2014 UTC,"I know someone who used to sail Contenders. I think they moved onto something like an RS 600.  Frankly, I spent so much time in the water in my 'stable' Laser EPS, I don't know how they manage to keep those things upright.  Anyway, if you think a Contender is hardcore, check out the International Moth - a sailing dinghy with hydrofoils..."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,Jaiez,2,Tue Sep 9 08:45:10 2014 UTC,"Damn, this looks like fun! If I'm ever moving to the coast, I'm buying one. But the Laser EPS looks much less stable than the Contender? It's much smaller. The Moth looks like like a total badass though."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,Hovsky,2,Tue Sep 9 19:32:58 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that the Contender has a larger sail (10.1 10.8 m2 vs 9.3 m2 ); it also has a trapeze, which can be tricky to deal with in a single-handed boat. Also, Contenders are often rigged with the mast raked back significantly, resulting in the boom sitting quite low; compare the Contender to the Laser EPS. This makes it difficult to get under the boom when tacking. Getting stuck under the boom when close hauled = capsize."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,gdshred95,2,Tue Sep 9 20:23:51 2014 UTC,"Wow, this was very interesting, thank you! The sport looks like so much fun. And I now know something about sailing!"

AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,bsurg,2,Tue Sep 9 04:18:37 2014 UTC,Is there a quick release for the harness if he capsizes?  Even if there is it sounds terrifying to swim with all the ropes there...
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,CoolGuy54,3,Tue Sep 9 04:36:16 2014 UTC,"The harness attaches to a ring on the trapeze with a hook like this. As soon as the tension on the trapeze is released, the trapeze simply unhooks.  As for getting tangled in the rigging, it doesn't usually happen. If you capsize, you'll usually fall ""underneath"" the boat like this, and even if you don't, you'll be more ""on top"" of the rigging than ""in"" the rigging. Still, it's not impossible, and that's why all sailors wear life jackets, and many carry knives, to cut themselves free in an emergency."
AdrenalinePorn,2fv23l,SubcommanderMarcos,2,Tue Sep 9 04:47:17 2014 UTC,"I've capsized small sailboats countless times, and it's not a problem, you stay above everything.  With a bit of practice you can move to the outside of the hull and stay on top of the boat as it goes over, stand on the centreboard to right it, and jump back in without ever ending up in the water."

AdrenalinePorn,2fpw9t,thelaughingbuddha,17,Sun Sep 7 14:43:04 2014 UTC,"Yeah, if you check out /u/TheRK's post there's a video that shows them being towed up. Also, like /u/An0k said, gliders are intense since you have to so carefully manage your speed and energy; this stunt took a lot of skill from both pilots."

You often pull 2 or 3g with 60 degrees bank angles. And all you do depends on your skill.
AdrenalinePorn,2fpw9t,An0k,13,Sun Sep 7 18:46:13 2014 UTC,Yes!  Gliders: the most intense way to fly short of a military jet.
AdrenalinePorn,2fpw9t,An0k,3,Sun Sep 7 15:27:18 2014 UTC,debatable but certainly winch-launches are a hell of a rush.

As I said in my other comment, if you have the chance to fly in the mountains you come very very close to the slopes rushing at 120kph (70mph) crisscrossing with other gliders. You often pull 2 or 3g with 60 degrees bank angles. And all you do depends on your skill to stay in the air so you have a real sens of accomplishment. Save for acrobatics, flying with an engine is more of a sightseeing (with the technical aspect of flying) than a sport. Nothing bad with this, and flying is a reward by itself but a regular glider pilot will see and do a lot more.  A good example of the kind of things you can do when you are moderately good (or a bit lucky)"

I can say with pretty good confidence that Red-bull is one of the largest if not THE largest single sponsor of motor sport and other adrenalin related sports. Their energy drinks Im guessing is only a small part of their profit. Hell, They own 2 Formula 1 Teams, which is no comparison the most expensive sport in the world. Not only do they have their fingers in all this but they do very, very well. Most of their motorsport teams have championship contention regularly."

AdrenalinePorn,2ff7yd,mentosfresh,4,Thu Sep 4 13:09:11 2014 UTC,It's been a hell of a year. It's hard to see someone like Alex go who was always putting safety first. Such a great guy.
AdrenalinePorn,2ff7yd,redshiftleft,11,Thu Sep 4 14:22:55 2014 UTC,"who was always putting safety first   I think that tells you a lot about this sport.  If you look at the statistics, skydiving is a very controllable risk with proper diligence.  General aviation can be a controllable risk.  Motorcycles and BASE appear to kill people irrespective of their level of discipline and attention to safety, which is really sad.  It's hard to justify doing much BASE because I have this feeling that it kills people despite a high attention to detail :("
AdrenalinePorn,2ff7yd,secretgspot,2,Fri Sep 5 08:09:39 2014 UTC,"Very well put. Alex never would have jumped if he felt there were any dangerous variables, but the sport still took him."

The sport took him in that there is still an inherent risk that the flier can't always account for.  Shit happens.  And it's a sad thing to occur.  But it happens.  And they know the risk.  But have some fucking dignity, man."

AdrenalinePorn,2f2pa3,datbosskid,4,Sun Aug 31 20:32:50 2014 UTC,Watch the bike he does two complete spins. And if you look at his shoulders you can still tell he does a 720. I don't know if its my background in extreme sports that helps me see this stuff better or something else but he clearly does a 720. Quite similar to skiing where my background is.

He flailed to try to correct himself from doing a flip and possibly not being able to open or get caught in his lines and die.
