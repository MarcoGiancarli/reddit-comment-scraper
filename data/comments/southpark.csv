My favorite is by far the imagination land trilogy.  But coon and friends and the Game of wieners or whatever are great too.  I lovd how they practically give us a whole movie in a 3 episode format.
southpark,3dsxdu,CLXIX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:31:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, the mini trilogies are kind of why I don't mind that they never did actually make another movie."
southpark,3dsxdu,silas34,2,Sun Jul 19 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"Don't forget ""Stick of Truth"" and upcoming ""The Fractured but Whole""."
southpark,3dsxdu,KFCNyanCat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"For me, Stick of Truth is what makes up for the lack of a second movie, due to it's lengthy and epic storyline. The only trilogy I LOVED was the Black Friday Trilogy (Coon & Friends was okay, of the Meteor Shower trilogy I only liked Cat Orgy, and I'm probably one of the few South Park fans who didn't like Imaginationland.)"

southpark,3dsxdu,WeirdoMTL,2,Sun Jul 19 11:06:26 2015 UTC,"The trilogy came out right around the same time as the South Park movie too and I remember reading (or hearing, perhaps on one of the DVD commentaries) about how Matt and Trey, in retrospect, realized how crazy the idea of producing an interlocked trilogy of episodes was at the same time as doing all of the promo for Bigger, Longer and Uncut.  That was a great summer."

southpark,3dupst,mrfinleyjones,2,Sun Jul 19 17:40:21 2015 UTC,"On all the DVDs and Blu-rays of the seasons you bought.  Except for Season 2. They refused to make commentary for that season, because they didn't like that the commentaries for the first question were not included in the DVDs. You had to write in to South Park Studios to get the S1 commentaries. Matt explained it like this: ""This is our audio commentary for the first 13 episodes of the international comedy super-hit South Park. Warner Brothers would not release it on the DVD without editing some of it's content for ""standards"" issues. Trey and I simply love the sounds of our own voices to let this happen. We also believe in a little thing called the First Amendment. After you hear it you may wonder ""What was the big deal about it anyway?"" Good question. And one better directed at Warner Brothers than at a TV screen. So let them know what you think. Trey and I did. And enjoy our first ever sober audio commentary.""  --Matt Stone, Kabul 2002   So Matt and Trey didn't offer commentaries for Season 2, and have never offered to make them for that season since."

So instead of $100/mo to pay to have to be at cable's mercy, I'm paying $18/mo to have most of the same content on demand.  My ""white noise"" show is South Park typically. I've gone through the series probably twice since I ditched cable.  No more shitty programming to worry about or reruns of failed Comedy Central shows. Hulu has a bunch of other great TV series.  And yes, they still have commercials but they're far shorter than cable while getting a bunch of quality shows hours after they were live on demand.

southpark,3dbdkc,Chutzvah,14,Wed Jul 15 15:27:11 2015 UTC,They had one question about video games and they asked what classic Nintendo game is set in Hyrule?

southpark,3dbdkc,HittingSmoke,28,Wed Jul 15 15:29:15 2015 UTC,Not really surprising at all. Jeopardy has a ton of pop culture questions. It's a minority category but it does come up quite regularly.
southpark,3dbdkc,whatisthishere,11,Wed Jul 15 09:37:57 2015 UTC,"They do, but it's pretty tough asking what the name of Stan's dad is, unless you are a fan."
southpark,3dbdkc,cannibalAJS,22,Wed Jul 15 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"But it's Jeopardy, the whole point is to know more useless facts that everyone else. That includes mainstream entertainment characters.

It is not surprising Jeopardy contestants didn't get it.  You think they have seen tons of episodes, or researched South Park trivia so they know Stan's dad?  The first thing I said was they will know the parents of Romeo and Juliet, but not knowing the South Park characters' parents isn't surprising."
southpark,3dbdkc,CrankMuffler,0,Wed Jul 15 06:46:00 2015 UTC,"Point of Jeopardy is to know more facts about shit, that only certain people would care about, than others.   For this purpose: Knowing about Romeo&Juliet's parents and knowing about Stan's father are exactly the same thing."

southpark,3dbdkc,whatisthishere,2,Wed Jul 15 08:20:54 2015 UTC,"You still need to be a fan, Stan's dad became a favorite character, but he was originally just another background parent.  I think the reason they asked the question like that is because it got a little news coverage.  They don't think they watched the last season of South Park, but the South Park and Lorde thing got talked about."

southpark,3d3b54,ciny,37,Mon Jul 13 17:26:40 2015 UTC,the song is just amazing  ♫ heeereeee he is  the biggest douche in the universe  in all the galaxies  there's no bigger douche than you  you reached the top  the pinnacle of douchedom  good going douche  your dreams have come true ♫
southpark,3d3b54,kakihara0513,20,Mon Jul 13 13:59:06 2015 UTC,Came in to say John Edwards.  It was good enough of a dismantling of cold reading that Penn and Teller said they don't need to do a Bullshit! episode because South Park did it as good as can be.
southpark,3d3b54,njara,9,Mon Jul 13 14:13:52 2015 UTC,"To avoid any confusion, John Edward is a self-proclaimed psychic that South Park made fun of, whereas John Edwards is a former Senator from North Carolina and was John Kerry's running mate in 2004."

And even though she couldn’t sing like Beyonce, or dance like Beyonce, or act like Beyonce, or be a decent human being like Beyonce, the little Hobbit was looked up to and loved just like Beyonce.   So the Hobbit prayed to God and God said don’t worry little Hobbit, I will go find this Jelly Monster girl and read her a story and melt her icy heart and the Hobbit said thank you and the Hobbit and God lived happily ever after because I love her so much.”"

Some of the stuff they made chef say through obviously crude editing (""I'm gonna make love to your buttholes, children."") was just brutal. I love Isaac Hayes as a musician, but his reasons for leaving the show were totally hypocritical and he deserved the ridicule."
southpark,3d3b54,TinOwlJohn,77,Mon Jul 13 08:40:43 2015 UTC,It also seems like they weren't even mad as Isaac. They were angry with scientology/ists for making him that way.

southpark,3d3b54,RotmgCamel,16,Mon Jul 13 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"They at the very least assaulted his intellect throughout. Sure, Scientology was the but of the joke, but Isaac Hayes was so blinded by his cult he compromised his art and reputation because of it. In the episode they treat chef like a child that isn't able to make decisions for himself. That was probably hard for him to swallow."
southpark,3d3b54,Totally_a_Banana,45,Mon Jul 13 17:44:06 2015 UTC,"I've no sympathy for him after they way he left.  Happy to insult Jews, Christians, Muslims, gays, blacks, Hispanics etc etc, but make fun of Scientology... NOW You've crossed the line.

I think that the Church of scientology forced him to leave. I doubt he would have left the show for making fun of his religion. The Church of Scientology probably threatened him and told him to quit. Just a theory."
southpark,3d3b54,x73rmin8r,4,Mon Jul 13 14:36:04 2015 UTC,"True. That was just two months before Season 10 began. Then he suffered a stroke and Scientology pounced on the chance to close ranks around him and keep him away from the public. At the same time, there were worldwide protests and riots over the Danish cartoons lampooning Muhammad, and that must have played a role in Hayes' public resignation from the show."
southpark,3d3b54,this-is_bullshit,9,Mon Jul 13 18:22:38 2015 UTC,The reason why he left was cause of the Scientology episode.  He deserved to be ridiculed cause he had no problems with previous episodes of South Park making fun of everything else will that episode.
southpark,3d3b54,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,5,Mon Jul 13 12:50:22 2015 UTC,From what I read somewhere (can't quite remember where) Isaac didn't leave the show purely because of the Scientology episode. There was a lot more to the story but the episode was essentially the final push for him.

The term ""statutory"" means that, citing a statute, or a law, it is defined as rape. Statutory rape has to refer to a law on the state or federal books or it is not statutory rape. They draw a difference here because consent is defined by the statute in this case, not by the victim--aka, a 14 year old may consent but the statute says you can't beget sexual consent from a 14 year old. Having sex with 14 year olds is statutory rape regardless of whether they told you they wanted it or not.  If the law states that people 16 and older may consent to sex, then by the statute, she did not rape him. She'll probably get fired, get run out of town and bullied by residents, and forever show up on google results for her name when employers decide to check her out, but she won't get prison time.

If the victim is less than 18 and the partner is a parent, guardian, sibling or any other person closer than a fourth cousin or has any type of authority over the victim (for example, a teacher) then the assailant may be charged with a crime. For instance, it's criminal for a manager of any age to have sex with a 17-year-old subordinate, even if the sex was consensual.  State law specifies (by not saying anything) that minors between 13 and 15 years old may, in general, engage in a consensual sexual relationship with someone up to four years older. Therefore, for example, it is legal for a 14-year-old male or female to engage in consensual sex with a person up to 18 years of age.

Try to stay with me and not get blinded by some instinctual rage as tends to happen thus eliminating reasonable discourse.   What about sexuality is harmful to a child?   Pregnancy, STD, physical health, yeah, all great concerns, but those are concerns about sex across the board. Only better public education will reduce these problems and not abstinence. I digress.   As adults/parents we make decisions every day on behalf of children to best bring them into adulthood. Beyond that they are autonomous beings who make decisions on their own. Kids are quite aware of things they like and dislike. It is difficult to say that children need to be protected from sexuality in one hand and say that our society has an archaic view of sexuality due mainly to religion (which also has a hand in bad parenting practices too) in the other hand.   I think consent is super simple. The adult should know what is good or bad for a child's health. From that starting point, I would not find any problem with a child being sexual with a responsible adult as long as the child is happy and consents.   I'm on mobile, so typing more is difficult. Please argue with me and create discourse. I'm not perfect nor is anyone. Pick my words apart as best you can and I, in kind, will try to elaborate on my beliefs."
southpark,3czr2v,TelMegiddo,7,Sun Jul 12 15:50:39 2015 UTC,"archaic view of sexuality due mainly to religion    Wouldn't an archaic view of sexuality be allowing young kids to make sexual choices?  Many religions allowed and encouraged young girls to get married at a young age, some still do."

It was never a big thing for teens or young girls to get married in many religions, the reason didn't matter. Prearranged or love.  Teen girls fall ""In Love"" with older guys all the time.  16yo Courtney Stoddard married a 50yo old guy and is still married to him.  Jerry Lee Lewis married his 13yo cousin, that wasn't arranged, when he was 22."
southpark,3czr2v,Dcajunpimp,-2,Sun Jul 12 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"All of your references are pretty recent in human history so I wouldn't call those archaic.   Even so, if it was done out of love why would you want to prevent that? I know plenty if adults that are immature about love and sex and aren't very good at either, but that doesn't mean they should be denied the right to seek it out. It comes back to personal liberty. As long as you don't interfere in other's liberties, do whatever pleases you."
southpark,3czr2v,TelMegiddo,2,Sun Jul 12 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"Because I doubt people 100-500,000 years ago getting married under the age of 18 were all forced and or arranged marriages.  Those examples were of teen girls wanting to marry and or have sex with older men.  Religions have and were ok with those marriages, archaic views have and were ok with those marriages.  Not allowing anyone under the age of 18 to consent to sex or marriage isn't an archaic religious belief.  Religions generally didn't want unmarried people having sex, they had no problems marrying kids.  Its fairly modern, not to want kids to marry.  edit. words"

However as she is a teacher, in a position of responsibility and authority, it makes it manipulative and coercive. In the UK this is still illegal, and according to Wikipedia, the same is true in NJ:   There is an exception. If the victim is less than 18 and the partner is a parent, guardian, sibling or any other person closer than a fourth cousin or has any type of authority over the victim (for example, a teacher) then the assailant may be charged with a crime.

I think if we just changed the terminology, people wouldn't make light of it as much as they do. ""Statutory Rape"" should be renamed to ""Statutory Intercourse"" or something, because it's not rape.   you think trivialising it with a less serious and inaccurate name would make people make light of it less?"
southpark,3czr2v,ChronaMewX,7,Sun Jul 12 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"But both parties did consent, and both parties were of the age of consent.

southpark,3czr2v,MashMango,-5,Sun Jul 12 14:53:14 2015 UTC,"No, sexual consent is a little more complicated than a 'willingness' to have sex at the time. Having said that, it's still straightforward. If one party has authority over the other, then they are not in a position to consent, and it's rape. The key is that they're been taken advantage of.   Consent isn't the issue here, the whole teacher/student thing was   because of the issue of consent.   A crime, sure, but if we consider this rape then we're devaluing...well, actual rape.

To be clear, I am not into victim blaming, however a lot of the reports have been greatly sensationalized. She is a close family friend and jumping to conclusions on either side is wrong before more real facts come to light. While some allegations toward predators have been proven to be true, there are others that were false that have ruined lives. She is an extremely kind person. I hope that the truth does come to light and that justice is served, but with all of the false reporting I don't know how she will recover even in the case of innocence."

southpark,3cwd0v,BigWill2k,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"I think what happened here was someone had set up an entry for Wendy's zombie form from Pinkeye, but someone from SPS created a ""Nazi Zombie"" version of her for reasons unknown. If you can remember the game, all of the human Nazi Zombies had greenish skin. The ""Nazi Zombie Wendy"" the Official Wiki posted only has bags under her eyes and a swastika armband on her left arm. I guess there is still a possibility that Wendy and various other characters were supposed to become Nazi Zombies at some point during the game's production cycle."
southpark,3cwd0v,BigWill2k,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:18:22 2015 UTC,"I just got word from someone who's been working on the official Wiki, JVM, that this was partly his fault. He once had the Pinkeye zombies and the Nazi zombies together in one group. Wendy was supposed to go into the Pinkeye zombie group when he finally split the group in two, but he forgot to move her. Same with zombie Pip. Of course, there are two zombie Chefs - the Pinkeye one and the Nazi one. Anyway, nall, who has a paying job at South Park Studios, drew up Nazi zombie Wendy (and forgot to give her green skin), and then JVM put in an entry for Nazi zombie Pip (for which there isn't an image) to see if nall would catch it... and nall didn't.  JVM tells me that there's something weird about Mel Gibson too, heh."

In the United States South Park is rated TV-MA: This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17. TV-MA: This program may contain one or more of the following: crude indecent language (L), explicit sexual activity (S), or graphic violence (V).

southpark,3cjx3j,Gamerhcp,143,Wed Jul 8 15:18:02 2015 UTC,I think Matt/Trey want it that way.  They can block off the 10-week period for South Park and use the rest of the year for other projects.  They probably make a good amount of scratch for 10 weeks of work too.

southpark,3cjx3j,Tom_Brett,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:53:47 2015 UTC,the office did that for maybe 3 of its 9 seasons. there were A LOT of stinkers in seasons 1 and 5-9. Seinfeld i agree with.
southpark,3cjx3j,pjdwyer30,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:46:26 2015 UTC,Season 1 yes I agree but in the early stages of the seasons it's almost so like they need to get some developmental episodes out of the way. Seasons 2-5 were gold. Idk if I like the characters I don't really mind any of the bad episodes. You can't have them all be masterpieces.  South Park did this too. I'd say from season 5-12 it was the golden years and early on it's too coarse and after 14 it's too soft

Yeah it sucks because I'd love to have 24-26 episode seasons again, but on the other hand if they hadn't of cut back on the number of episodes we probably would have never got The Book of Mormon or The Stick of Truth.

southpark,3cjx3j,_Bumble_Bee_Tuna_,15,Wed Jul 8 20:02:49 2015 UTC,"The first episode of the new season will tackle gay marriage and the Confederate Flag, it's entitled ""Confederate Fag"" Then, ""Caitlyn Gender"" - Stan has an affair, with a man! Followed by ""Left Shark, Right Shark, Black Shark, White Shark"" observing divisiveness in the media on racial and political issues - and the sensationalism behind deflategate. Leading finally to, ""Net Brutrality"" tackling the issues of police abusing their authority and net neutrality."
southpark,3cjx3j,mynewspiritclothes,5,Wed Jul 8 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"Looking forward to them!  And just to remind everyone on how much ahead of their time Matt and Trey are, they've already had shows that touched on both of these.    They had an episode on the South Park flag which paralleled the Confederate flag.  And they also touched on gay marriage when Mr. Garrison tried to break up Mr. Slaves wedding.  I'll be interested on their take on the updated versions of these events!"
southpark,3cjx3j,nilok1,4,Wed Jul 8 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"Heh... I made it up.  :)  I'm positive they'll touch on these issues, though.  I really hope they do deflategate."
southpark,3cjx3j,mynewspiritclothes,3,Wed Jul 8 19:25:08 2015 UTC,"Last few seasons they have been avoiding the BIG issues to some extent. Could be because they already touched on them in the past though. This sub was going crazy waiting for a North Korea episode but we already had an entire movie about how utterly fucked up NK is. They've done LGBT and racism episodes, hell Mrs. Garrison got railed in detail with her designer vagina and the fan base barely bat an eye, doubtful a Jenner episode is going to happen."

southpark,3cjx3j,bios_hazard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"Similar to you, I mostly stopped caring around Season 16. I'm honestly confused when people on this subreddit argue that the recent seasons are up to par with the early years. The show uses way too much pop-culture references and social commentary these days. At times it is preachy and obvious. South Park has always relied on this method, but at one point it wasn't so overt. I still watch South Park when new episodes premiere, but I have zero interest in rewatching recent episodes.   Edit: Just for reference, I think South Park's last GREAT stretch of seasons was Seasons 9-11."
southpark,3cjx3j,sopranosthrowaway,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"You're right about 9 and 10 being the best, but the last season was excellent. 12-whatever before the last season were on average not great."

They thought of killing off Kyle, but thought better of it. Kyle might have been Stan's clone, but Kenny was more like a prop than a character.  And yes, with Kenny gone, MnT wanted to try out a new fourth boy. When that wasn't working out, they had Cartman being possessed by Kenny until the boys could get Kenny into a pot roast... which Rob Schneider found, cooked, and ate. Rob then died by getting impaled on the flagpole like Kenny did in ""Weight Gain 4000"", and this allowed Kenny to come back the way he came back before. :)"

However they did do a Minecraft episode as well as a guitar hero one. Knowing Trey and Matt as well as the boys in South Park all play video games it's likely we will see another if not many more video game related episodes but they will only make one for relevant games that have something new to offer or if they think of a creative way to build an episode around any particular game. That being said I could see an E-Sport episode and LoL is a prime candidate for an episode like that so don't rule out it happening."

If she had said ""Fuck all of you, this is my company and I'll do what I want,"" she would have been crucified. But she took responsibility and said that they are going to fix the problems and that's not good enough either.  I know very little of her history in general or her history at reddit but no one deserves to be treated the way she is being treated now. Period."
southpark,3cbq96,twalker294,-2,Tue Jul 7 01:01:48 2015 UTC,Totally disagree. Maybe you need to go read up on the crap she's done and exactly why everyone feels fit she leave.

She doesn't mean a single word she wrote though and is laughing to the bank. Simply writing the word ""sorry"" doesn't mean jack shit. If she truly meant she wanted to do better at listening to us she would step down. But no, instead she just says ""sorry"" and continues on like nothing happened.  TL;DR: There's nothing special about a piece of shit CEO saying ""sorry."""

Timed - when will we see the change?"
southpark,3cbq96,Rufus_Reddit,4,Tue Jul 7 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"So far she's brought frivolous litigation against a previous employer, her husband is being investigated, she's eliminated any contract negotiations because she doesn't believe women are good at them, she's mismanaged the service her company provides, she's pissed off a huge segment of the community of said service in the process, she's pissed off the unpaid people who do  (like it or not) a lot of the work so they don't HAVE to pay real employees, and she's hurt the brand.   I'd say just with that, and I'm sure I've missed stuff, she should step down. Unless reddit starts losing money though, that isn't going to happen.   This person is incompetent, and is undeserving of her position."
southpark,3cbq96,VapeApe,3,Tue Jul 7 05:19:48 2015 UTC,"Like someone said earlier, this is just another straw on the camel's back.  She's obviously done stuff that have upset people before, and her background is more than shady enough that it has already gotten people to disapprove of her.  Not to mention the shadowbanning she supposedly did.  There really isn't anything that she can do to ""atone"" for her sins right now. We've all dealt with people when they were pissed off, you have to give them time.  /u/Buddy explains it perfectly. She is not the type of person that should be running this website. She's already proven it time and time again. How many more chances do you give people?"

A lot of them really stinking up the place nowadays, but Fox just continues to renew season after season. I'd say as long as there's someone there to write/create... Then the Simpsons may never end.   Matt & Trey on the other hand... I think they're smart enough to end the show on a high note rather than to just keep it going for the hell of it. We all freaked out a few seasons ago when Stan started seeing everything for the shit that it truly is. I think they'll be around for a while as long as it's on their terms. They just want to do other things... Video games, movies, musicals, I'm sure they have some type of comedic genius book to pump out down the road...

Anyway, they were all at some office waiting to get their internet money. It was a pretty good episode."

They probably fucked over the AMA's that were set for the next day or two, but she didn't use sorcery to do what she did."
southpark,3byxpg,AngrySandyVag,0,Fri Jul 3 17:09:48 2015 UTC,Except that she did. She was the middle man for larger celebrities that were set to do an AMA. She also was able to ensure that the proof was real as she'd be in direct contact. She provided a huge amount of help and support for the sub.
southpark,3byxpg,OneSoggyBiscuit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"She didn't get interviews with all of those celebrities because she knew them, she was able to get them because Reddit is such a huge website that when you call their publicist representing Reddit, they will listen.

southpark,3byxpg,AngrySandyVag,2,Fri Jul 3 17:38:58 2015 UTC,"Did I say she knew the celebrities? No, I said she acted as a middle man.

southpark,3byxpg,AngrySandyVag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"Yes there are other people who could fill in the job, but it would best be fit by an admin who can openly communicate with the moderators of a sub that size. The process for AMA's are anything but simple. They require a lot of work and communication, which has been voiced that the Admins do not communicate.   Firing an employee who had vital integrity to the process of the sub unexpectedly causes an extensive amount of problems. It's also not about having someone else do the job, it's about the admins not communicating that she would be terminated with no replacement."

southpark,3byxpg,NiceGuyNate,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:53:47 2015 UTC,"It seems you don't know the effect their decision made. Victoria was essential to process of AMA and had a big impact elsewhere, a no notice termination caused the content of a sub to go to non-existent."
southpark,3byxpg,OneSoggyBiscuit,3,Fri Jul 3 15:14:14 2015 UTC,"This happens all the time in the corporate world. Sometimes you don't know how valuable one particular employee is until they're gone and just because they're valuable, doesn't mean that you can keep them if they've committed a fireable offense. Losing access to some projects for a little while does not justify the amount of butthurt that's been going around."

The uproar isn't solely about her, it's about the consistent actions the admins have made towards the community.   She made a huge impact on the site in a wide direction and was terminated for no discernible reason."
southpark,3byxpg,OneSoggyBiscuit,3,Fri Jul 3 21:40:55 2015 UTC,"I understand that she was important to the community, and I think the drama is seriously threatening the stability of the site. I do understand that some of the decisions of Reddit HQ are beginning to bite them in the ass. I've been here for a looonnng time (check my profile, yo).  But you are not entitled to know the reason for her firing, unless she herself tells you. Why would anyone tell you?  I had to fire an employee once for verbally and physically assaulting me in my own office in front of other employees and within earshot of customers. It was not a fun day. Not for him, and not for me. The worst part was that I know that he is a good person that was under a lot of stress, and that his outburst was not his ""best."" It was the kind of thing that was so egregious that I had no choice lest it destabilize the rest of my team. You can bet your ass that I never commented on it to anybody lest it affect his reputation. He's a good man. You're never entitled to anybody's personal employment details no matter how integral they were to your own projects. Sometimes these things happen, and it doesn't mean either party is bad or trying to screw the other.   I am concerned about Reddit, but I feel all this drama over Victoria is unfair to both her and Reddit management. While I'm sure she appreciates that people like her, if she was fired for cause then it's got to be super-embarrassing to have all this attention heaped on her."
southpark,3byxpg,keebiejeebie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"Hot diggity daffodil, you have been here for quite some time. But I'm seeing this situation as more of a straw that broke that camels back. I've been here for around four years, with this account being the newest.   But this is really being an issue about the continuous lack of communication from the admins. We've had subs deleted based on what seems like personal feelings. We have rules from them that are not being fully enforced. And now we have a admin who held a very important position for a large part of the site.   And yes, perhaps she did something that would justify a termination. But in light of the events happening recently, the lack of a response only serves to add to the problem. And with the recent controversial actions of the admins, it couldn't have been done at a worse time."

She was very good at her job. She was always there just as you got out of the water, she would give you good advice on proper drying and she made sure that freshly cleaned towels were always available to those who needed them. For reasons not yet known, she left her employment.  The people who run /r/IAMA got very upset because they have a lot of pool parties and relied on this woman to make sure they had a good supply of towels. They didn't think they would be able to run the pool without her always there to supply towels so they shut the pool down.  In solidarity, a number of other swimming pools were shut down as well as some bath houses and public toilets as the people who ran these places protested the poor supply of towels across the site and the frustration this causes when people are all wet and have nothing to dry themselves with."

I think it's one of those shows where you have to understand how the world works a little bit more.   When the show first started it was just more immature humor and fart jokes which was easy for young teenagers to get into. A lot of their new seasons have deeper social messages that probably go over young teens heads. So I think in general their audience requires a more socially aware audience to get the full enjoyment of the show."

southpark,3bniqu,themitey1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:15:01 2015 UTC,"This is true but on the flip side, some of the episodes are so driven by a current event that once time has passed and the story is gone from the news, the episode loses a lot of its humor. Unless you religiously follow the news and/or have a great memory, it can be tight to find some of the jokes funny a few months or years later.  Luckily they are usually smart enough to choose stories that are big enough or have universal elements to them that make them always funny. But sometimes they don't."

They also jacked up adprices on Comedy Central from something like $5000 to $100000 during prime time.

southpark,3bniqu,AzBrah,43,Wed Jul 1 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"You didn't fix it, in fact adding a comma just makes it more confusing. The problem is that it says 'without' when it should say 'with'. the correct way to write that is:  ""With Colbert and Stewart gone, South Park is their biggest show""."
southpark,3bniqu,spinblackcircles,6,Wed Jul 1 03:38:20 2015 UTC,Thank you.
southpark,3bniqu,RotmgCamel,2,Wed Jul 1 04:01:20 2015 UTC,No problem. I read that post about 10 times before I realized I was not stupid and it still needed fixing.
southpark,3bniqu,spinblackcircles,12,Wed Jul 1 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, South Park did made Comedy Central, but you need to remember that Comedy Central its a branch of Viacom (owner of Paramount Pictures) which already was a really big company."
southpark,3bniqu,donkeybonner,15,Tue Jun 30 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"Actually there's a bit more to that story, and the history is relevant to the discussion. Comedy Central was formed after the time warner owned 'the comedy channel' and viacom's 'Ha!' were combined in 1990. Even though both parent companies were very large, this was a very small division and the channel received very little funding for original content and for years was almost entirely dependent on movie reruns for their ad revenue.  Comedy Central was smaller than the other Viacom owned channels (MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon) by a wide margin for years and the budget for original programming was minuscule in comparison and mostly consisted of stand up comedy specials, which are about the cheapest thing in the world to produce.  Parker and stone, in the wake of becoming cult famous with orgazmo and 'spirit of Christmas', had shopped South Park around to several channels including HBO before settling on Comedy Central, because they felt that being somewhat censored would make the show funnier. they weren't paid much and their budget as you can tell in the first season was tiny.   South Park exploding over night completely made Comedy Central and gave them the freedom to launch more original scripted programming and increase revenues a hundred fold. It's not overstating to say that Comedy Central may not exist anymore without South Park or would have stayed just a showcase for stand up.   In 2003 viacom bought time warner's share for $1.3 billion. So while it's true that Viacom is and was huge when Comedy Central started, they have many different divisions within that company and Comedy Central was barely in the top 10 as far as revenue and as such, funding. And now I believe it is their second most profitable division. So it is correct to say that South Park is solely responsible for Comedy Central becoming a huge and highly profitable company, their parent corporation being huge really didn't mean that it wouldn't have been dissolved, combined with MTV, or continued as a barely profitable stand up comedy channel without South Park becoming a smash hit phenomenon.   TL;DR: Viacom is a big corporation but Comedy Central was a very small division with no funding and very low revenue before South Park. Now it is one of the most profitable divisions of Viacom."

southpark,3bniqu,radii314,18,Wed Jul 1 03:39:34 2015 UTC,How many comedian talk/sketch shows have they been through? There's a new one every few months with a random comedian's name attached to it that never last's more than one season
southpark,3bniqu,HoChiMiner,25,Tue Jun 30 19:51:15 2015 UTC,And they still show chappelles show at least once a day. And I always laugh way too hard for a 10+ year old show with 20~ episodes
southpark,3bniqu,skitzokid1189,2,Tue Jun 30 21:25:22 2015 UTC,Chappelles show is indeed hilarious but what does the amount of episodes a show has have to do with how good it is?
southpark,3bniqu,spinblackcircles,10,Wed Jul 1 04:02:14 2015 UTC,"Because he's watched the same handfull of episodes over and over and still finds them funny, as opposed to a show with +200 episodes like South Park."
southpark,3bniqu,orli0,20,Wed Jul 1 05:17:15 2015 UTC,It's kinda like the music industry. They put these comedians out there and see what happens. Sometimes it sticks like Tosh or Chappell but otherwise it's just good exposure for the comedian and let's Comedy Central stay fresh. I don't think anyone is broken hearted when they lose their comedy central show. Chances are they've scored some movie roles off it and sold more specials. CC also probably saves a lot of money not having to these long running franchises.
southpark,3bniqu,abagofdicks,11,Tue Jun 30 20:15:28 2015 UTC,"IMO Nick Kroll did it right.  He realized that these comedian skits are short lived, so he made his 3 seasons only."

southpark,3bniqu,abagofdicks,2,Wed Jul 1 03:36:14 2015 UTC,I haven't seen it or anything about it in a long time. That being said I cut the cord a few months ago so I'm kind of behind on advertising.   EDIT: New season September 1st.
southpark,3bniqu,skeetsauce,6,Wed Jul 1 03:37:38 2015 UTC,"Not to mention they skimp on the budgets of those shows big time until they become profitable. On the rare occasion they get a Chappelle or a tosh, they get massive revenue from ad space on cheap as hell TV. If the show fails like 95% of them do, they lose about as much as a repeat episodes of South Park take them to make back.  By contrast network TV shows have much bigger stakes and can't skimp on funding nearly as much. When a network show tanks it costs them millions. Comedy Central has got producing new shows on the cheap down to a fine science.  But it's also why so many of the shows that have been on CC suck so badly. Some of them could have been decent with some funding but that's the deal when you shop your show with CC. You better be funny cause you ain't getting money to hire top tier writers or actors. Tosh.0 is the second most profitable show on CC right now; and it's obvious why. The budget of that show is 75% tosh's salary. The writing is awful and amateurish and they have no actors or special effects they have to pay for, but it is undeniably funny because of web videos that cost them nothing. Coming up with a show like that is a producer's wet dream."

We want entertainment at 11PM, if it's smart entertainment and good satire we might like it, but I do not believe this show will last.  It's a shame all of the shows older talent found better careers, because I think Samantha Bee could have really filled that role.

The show operates a specific way. And after 18/27 years, you know EXACTLY how you want things and you have enough pull to get whatever you want.

Don't get me wrong, I love South Park, but I feel like it's about run its course.  I also can't help but feel like they are being bought out a little bit. The episode ""You're Getting Old"" really felt like they were expressing how tired they are with doing the show. That and the shorter and shorter seasons, tied along with the fact that they do an episode in just a week, make me feel like they don't care about it as much as they used to.   Trey and Matt have had so many fantastic ideas in the past, I feel like a fresh start on a new show, or even another feature length movie would be amazing."

southpark,3brkze,GooglePerkins,3,Wed Jul 1 18:48:53 2015 UTC,If anything it's gotten better. They definitely haven't lost any appeal or run out of ideas. The key difference with SP and the Simpsons is that SP evolved into something more topical. They can produce episodes about an event just a couple of weeks after it happened.  Even the critics still love them. Didn't they win any Emmy a year or two ago for that Game of Thrones trilogy?
southpark,3brkze,Vnofd5,3,Wed Jul 1 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. The old ones are much better because they are not as aggressive in tackling social issues in the old episodes.

southpark,3brkze,loveroftrees24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe that they have gotten better from a stance of consistency in a overall ""story"" by keeping side stories like randy being lorde and lecturing stan and his grandpa about addiction and talking about how many songs it takes to pay it off and Towlie coming back on the special ed Summer camp. Also they have fine a great job of being socially aware of problems and issues that are popular and twisting an issue in the episode to see another stance and of course the fact that they are literally not afraid to get pulled after furtuamma being cancelled twice now and making a comeback both times being a good example of humor not being limited by stairs and trademarks."

The most recent one was good but definitely doesn't rival the best seasons. Then again we probably all have differing opinions on what the best seasons are. (for me around 3-6 were the funniest and around 8-11 had the best episode concepts). It's still watchable because they have funny takes on current events although personally I prefer storylines that were just silly situations in the older seasons rather than every episode being based on some real life person or event. They also seem a lot less innocent and stupid than they used to be and in my opinion they swear way too much to the point where it's not funny. Then again having said all that I did crack up at every instance of ""cartmanbrah"""

This banner was used with intimidation tactics against any group that the KKK disliked becoming the unofficial white right flag.   There is more hate than heritage and the heritage it has is closer linked to a domestic terrorist organization than to some lost idealized nation.   It represents hate and oppression to many citizens and still invokes an us vs them mentality.

southpark,3bfo9l,MY_GOOCH_HURTS,5,Tue Jun 30 00:31:24 2015 UTC,What idiocy is there from people who oppose the confederate flag from flying over official government grounds?
southpark,3bfo9l,immski,8,Mon Jun 29 02:15:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. The flag inherently supports a group that did not wish to be part of the United States and is thus unpatriotic. I feel like all racist arguments aside, it makes sense for governmental institutions not to fly it. And it makes sense for every other private institution and individual to retain the freedom of speech and permission to fly it at will."

southpark,3bcuir,Burrito-mancer,15,Sun Jun 28 11:29:51 2015 UTC,This guy was on askreddit refuting gay marriage and I immediately linked him to the butt buddies scene  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3ba35l/serious_antigayrights_thinking_people_can_you/cskcw4o?context=3
southpark,3bcuir,jamesabe,5,Sun Jun 28 05:39:09 2015 UTC,That's actually not a bad way of thinking about it. It does seem that historically marriage has meant a man and a woman. So an identical concept with a different name but all the same rights could be a viable option.
southpark,3bcuir,zarfman,9,Sun Jun 28 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to look at it that way, give everyone a civil union and nobody gets marriage by the state.  Because marriage LONG predates any abrahamic religion and shouldn't be co-opted by that religion just because they believe it belongs to them."
southpark,3bcuir,dizao,18,Sun Jun 28 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"But by calling it something else, it wouldn't be necessarily equal, would it?"
southpark,3bcuir,dakotacage,2,Sun Jun 28 16:37:53 2015 UTC,if it gave them the same rights and privileges then yes
southpark,3bcuir,stealer0517,25,Sun Jun 28 17:35:31 2015 UTC,Separate but equal. There's no way that could possibly go wrong.
southpark,3bcuir,Its_Always_420,6,Sun Jun 28 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I was referring to, but my brain couldn't remember the term. Thank you."
southpark,3bcuir,dakotacage,-1,Sun Jun 28 17:58:35 2015 UTC,what's going to stop people from treating a gay marriage differently from a normal one?
southpark,3bcuir,stealer0517,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:07:44 2015 UTC,Federal law
southpark,3bcuir,Its_Always_420,0,Sun Jun 28 19:23:33 2015 UTC,it would still be federal law. Literally the only difference would be the name
southpark,3bcuir,stealer0517,0,Mon Jun 29 01:30:42 2015 UTC,"No, federal law is the reason you can't have two separate types of marriage. Seriously we had all these debates less than 100 years ago. This should all be common knowledge now. Especially since this is a thread about a joke from South Park that points out how funny it is that people still don't get this."
southpark,3bcuir,Its_Always_420,0,Mon Jun 29 01:33:56 2015 UTC,Then change the law. That's what Congress is there for.
southpark,3bcuir,stealer0517,-6,Mon Jun 29 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing equal with identical. 2+2 is equal to 4, but they're not identical. They can be equal under the law without necessarily being referred to as the same entity."
southpark,3bcuir,LUClEN,6,Sun Jun 28 17:08:19 2015 UTC,Marriage hasn't always been one man and one woman though. For a long time it was one man and many women. Often times women were merely property to be traded in these marriages. Marriage is not Holy Matrimony which is probably the word you are looking for.
southpark,3bcuir,Galligan4life,-2,Sun Jun 28 17:23:45 2015 UTC,"I never referred to marriage, I just differentiated between being equal in name and being equal in all else. A rose by any other name, right?"
southpark,3bcuir,LUClEN,2,Sun Jun 28 17:29:01 2015 UTC,rose by any other name   Not if you called 'em stench blossoms.

southpark,3bcuir,G0PACKGO,6,Sun Jun 28 17:28:38 2015 UTC,"Been there, done that, declared unconstitutional in the 1960s"
southpark,3bcuir,Its_Always_420,0,Sun Jun 28 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"No, it's still relevant because there's a few bills that Congress will be voting on, if it makes it to the floor, that define marriage as between a man and a woman; H.R. 824, S.435, H.J. Res 32 are the bills."

The streets of West Hollywood were packed with people, and then some fags drove down the street and annoyed everyone. Drunken me yelled ""tell these fags to go away!"", Then I realized what I did and yelled again ""Southpark Fags!"". My lovely friend did the sound effect to make it clearer. Haha."

southpark,3baxx9,TinOwlJohn,4,Sat Jun 27 19:09:42 2015 UTC,I still want to use the word fag. But aimed at obnoxious jerk off's.
southpark,3baxx9,Zorkamork,4,Sat Jun 27 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"I'm real glad we had two straight dudes tell us gays that the word used to insult, degrade, and usually along with violence, actually doesn't mean gay."
southpark,3baxx9,mambotomato,11,Sat Jun 27 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"I know that the episode can very much be taken as callous and offensive, as many South Parks can, but in the interest of giving people the benefit of the doubt, they may have been trying to present a worldview in which being gay is a totally normal thing which doesn't bother anyone, and demeaning slurs are used against people who are actually annoying, like loud bikers. The joke very much hinges on homophobia, and even seeing it redirected has got to strike a nerve with people who have been at the receiving end of those slurs. But to a thirteen year old watching the show, maybe seeing that episode took a little of the impact away from the word, whether he was going to use it or be called it. Which might be good or bad, but ""bastard"" used to be a term you'd murder somebody over, and now that being born out of wedlock is normalized, it's just a generic slur. I guess they were trying to do the same thing with ""fag.""  I don't know. I can see why it's funny, and also why it's really insensitive."
southpark,3baxx9,Rekthor,4,Sat Jun 27 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"I've never seen South Park to be a show that makes any truly definitive claims like ""X is bad/good/stupid/funny"". Matt and Trey are satirists, and are therefore deconstructors before anything else; they criticize and question before they actually create anything. And that's a good thing for them.  I didn't read this episode as one that was saying ""the word 'fag' doesn't mean gay anymore, so stop whining about it"" (a definitive claim), I read it as one that recognized that language and culture is always changing, and that we should neither see ""fag"" as always a homophobic insult nor as always just another insult that has no homophobic connotations (a criticism of both absolutes). Sure, the boys play the straight men in this episode and - as they often do - act as Matt and Trey's voices, but even they recognize that ""fag"" is both now not always homophobic and not always ""just an insult"" (you can see that when Kyle says ""That's not very nice. Being gay doesn't make you a fag""). When you get down to it, the message of the episode was that the meaning and power of language changes based on how we use it, and we should pay attention to that usage rather than claim that the meaning is set in stone."
southpark,3baxx9,Zorkamork,-3,Sun Jun 28 02:46:36 2015 UTC,"But to a thirteen year old watching the show, maybe seeing that episode took a little of the impact away from the word, whether he was going to use it or be called it.    Considering how many grown ass men have quoted this episode at me to explain why them calling me a faggot isn't homophobic I 100% don't believe this is a thing. It's not their word to do that with, they don't get to say 'don't worry gays, we got this' because that word isn't a symbol of their oppression."
southpark,3baxx9,mambotomato,7,Sat Jun 27 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good intentions by a comedian rarely translate to positive interpretation by fans. Chris Rock had the same problem. It's disappointing that the outcome of the episode was shitty behavior in the streets."

southpark,3atpu2,rauf107,5,Tue Jun 23 20:03:39 2015 UTC,Weird that Judaism is not even in the top five most followed religions yet it's always considered one of the big ones...
southpark,3atpu2,thirstygoat,2,Tue Jun 23 22:56:07 2015 UTC,"Because without it, neither Christianity nor Islam would exist in any recognizable form."
southpark,3atpu2,Raesong,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:43:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course. But it doesn't mean its a ""major"" religion. At least not anymore man."
southpark,3atpu2,thirstygoat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:18:04 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter how big or small it is, it's one of the three  Abrahamic religions. Imagine how many more Jews would be here if the Holocaust didn't happen."
southpark,3atpu2,GamerX44,2,Wed Jun 24 11:28:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to argue the merit of said religions. The point is uniting the current world, and having 3 religions as an example, one of which consists of less that 15 million is a bit on the nose. If we are talking about uniting popular religions lets talk population...   edit: Stat fact. Judaism accounts for 0.2% of the world population... bigger fish to fry mate!"
southpark,3atpu2,thirstygoat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"Judaism, Islam, and Christianity have historically been very unkind to eachother. This was peace in the middle-east, not the world"

southpark,3axyja,Link442,13,Wed Jun 24 11:56:08 2015 UTC,Scott Tenorman Must Die is probably the best South Park episode ever.
southpark,3axyja,odkleban,2,Wed Jun 24 13:33:57 2015 UTC,Perfect episode to get you into Cartman and show who he is as a character.
southpark,3axyja,chemicalbeats37,5,Wed Jun 24 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"the best way is to start in the 1st season and watch,  but the episode that got me hooked was city wok and the Mongolians."
southpark,3axyja,justin_yermum,3,Wed Jun 24 12:43:23 2015 UTC,"I love the first season, but I'm afraid for a new comer it would feel too outdated for them to be able to appreciate it. But there Mongolian episode is a great idea, thanks. Anything with Lou Kim is hilarious."
southpark,3axyja,PeterParkerNotSpidey,2,Wed Jun 24 12:56:45 2015 UTC,City sushi is probably my favorite episode with Lou kim in it

southpark,3axyja,EagleRock1337,6,Wed Jun 24 14:40:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best way is to find an episode or two about something that pertains to them. Once they're hooked, then you can just go through the episodes season-by-season."
southpark,3axyja,EagleRock1337,7,Wed Jun 24 14:17:19 2015 UTC,That's a genius idea now that you mention it. My girlfriend is vegetarian so maybe I'll show her the veal episode. Thanks.
southpark,3axyja,MirrorB,11,Wed Jun 24 14:23:30 2015 UTC,"I was going out with a Special Ed teacher, so I had to show her the episode where Cartman tries to enter the Special Olympics.  After a few comments about how horrible the episode was, she said ""Yeah, what other episodes you got?""  Needless to say, we're getting married."

southpark,3axyja,KFCNyanCat,3,Wed Jun 24 17:46:11 2015 UTC,My favorite episode ever is Super Best Friends
southpark,3axyja,BestofBoston12,2,Wed Jun 24 18:24:39 2015 UTC,I'd say start with any episode from seasons 8 - 17

southpark,3axyja,gabe1108,2,Wed Jun 24 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"Freemium isn't free, though not as the first episode for her to watch, I chose this episode as it shows South Park as a social commentary than crude humor, and second as it gives the idea of character centric episodes, and it's a damn good one at that."
southpark,3axyja,EroticCakes,2,Wed Jun 24 22:35:52 2015 UTC,"I would personally recommend episodes where it's the kids just being kids. Those are always well rounded and delightful.  Like ""The list"", ""High School Musical""... and like others have mentioned ""The Losing Edge""...oh and Aspen lol there are so many. Along those themes, IMO"

southpark,3atocc,kdu3142,9,Tue Jun 23 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"Oh man I just watched Chappie yesterday for the first time and OH MY GOD WHAT AN AWFUL MOVIE.  The script was seriously worse than the Star Wars prequels.  I mean, when I first saw the previews, I was like ""Dude! It looks like a dystopian future where everyone is controlled by the evil robot police force.  Then a rogue group of rebels captures one and gives it legit AI in order to lead the revolution!""  No.  Not even close.  I'm not going to spoil anything plot wise, but how is it possible to make both Sigorny Weaver AND Hugh Jackman (accidentally) look like bumbling idiots on screen?  Tho the end was cool."
southpark,3atocc,spiderman_666,3,Tue Jun 23 15:59:38 2015 UTC,I thought the concept and basics of the movie was done really well but the whole Hugh Jackman back story thing was kind of trash.
southpark,3atocc,ITSTARTSRIGHTNOW,3,Tue Jun 23 16:35:34 2015 UTC,"The movie is pretty much ""Chappie is captured by a bunch of assholes who teach him to become an asshole and they are somehow the good guys?"""
southpark,3atocc,Sanjispride,3,Tue Jun 23 18:55:25 2015 UTC,Yeah dude.  And EVERY major decision that EVERY major character made was just plain retarded and only served to advance the awful story.
southpark,3atocc,spiderman_666,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:45:34 2015 UTC,"Like how Sigourney Weaver's character, the head of an advanced robotics company, didnt think that having the worlds first advanced AI would be at all beneficial to the company.   Nope, no way to make any money off of that!"
southpark,3atocc,Sanjispride,2,Wed Jun 24 00:26:50 2015 UTC,I liked it when it was called Short Circuit

southpark,3atocc,AlGoreBestGore,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:45:29 2015 UTC,"The story was so rushed. Needed more time to truly develop the characters and story. It was a big disappointment being a big fan of Blomkamp, but it had bits of awesome here and there."
southpark,3atocc,ShittyBrain,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:21:36 2015 UTC,I can't do it simply based on the retarded girl's fucking hair. Not even a mentally retarded person could be capable of that fucking hair style.

southpark,3aqltk,purpleclouds,4,Mon Jun 22 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"As long as it does a good job of setting up for the rest of the season.   Then you're in luck. You get a ton of backstory. It seems like this will be a much more violent season, if you're into that sort of thing."
southpark,3aqltk,popmurtha,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:17:34 2015 UTC,Yeah the whole episode until the last couple of minutes was all backstory. I kept waiting for them to bring the three characters together and they did at the very end. Looking forward to seeing where it goes...

I used clues from the background environment for time of year, holidays, and spoken clues which means the episodes are not necessarily in order of air date. I paird particularly close attention to the school schedule and what events took place on what day of the week. It wasn't possible to do it perfectly with some events, but I kept all references in order and tried to make it as realistic as possible for the time of year each episode felt, which was mostly winter with all the snow (although I allowed the snow to stay until June because it was shown all melting at once on the last day of school). If anyone sees any gaping holes, let me know! I'd like to get it as accurate as possible. I did not include the movie days.  I also marked each day Kenny died."

For example, singing the right tone to Imaginationland in the mic would activate a portal to Imaginationland. Purchasing a Gamesphere from the video store could unlock a new Towlie mission. Could be even better if the Xbox/PS4/PC detects speech related to getting wet (I'm so sweaty, I need a shower, I'm gonna get some water, ect) Towlie is activated as a playable character. Cartmanland could be a locked area forever, unless you come across a million dollars and suddenly you have the option to purchase it.

southpark,3a7aih,misterxy89,14,Thu Jun 18 04:00:36 2015 UTC,Well SoT changed publisher midway because THQ went under so there was a lot of juggling around before Ubisoft finally took over. There's also been layoffs at Obsidian during the development. Now that Ubisoft is developping and publishing the sequel it should be on better tracks.

I get the feeling that the whole thing was thrown together without much preparation, and everybody knows how Matt and Trey are infamously prickly about this kind of thing."
southpark,3a7aih,PeppyHare66,14,Thu Jun 18 11:35:17 2015 UTC,"Matt and Trey came out and where Matt and Trey, and that's what everyone expects. They aren't going to go through some stupid poorly written speech that Ubisoft does."
southpark,3a7aih,PhillAholic,3,Thu Jun 18 13:26:44 2015 UTC,Except for when they did  Aisha did a lot of hosting duties at E3 this year. She can't be expected to just KNOW how to talk to Matt and Trey
southpark,3a7aih,PeppyHare66,5,Thu Jun 18 13:42:25 2015 UTC,That segment wasn't like the rest of Ubisoft's keynote though. Trey cracks a joke then they tell an anecdote about never mapping out South Park before and then leave. No cringy hype speech or anything like that. Pretty normal stuff from Matt and Trey.
southpark,3a7aih,PhillAholic,26,Thu Jun 18 13:52:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm on pins and needles everytime I see her improvising jokes or doing anything live.

I'm sorry to say that, too. I think she is enjoyable sometimes and I'm always rooting for her to do good work. But man does she usually suck..."

southpark,3a7aih,JamesLiptonIcedTea,9,Thu Jun 18 14:05:04 2015 UTC,Why? They probably gave her no lines and she had no fucking clue what those guys were going to throw at her.
southpark,3a7aih,abagofdicks,7,Thu Jun 18 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"Didn't laugh at anything she said, looked like she made them feel the same way. All around made me uncomfortable."
southpark,3a7aih,HungryGhosty,8,Thu Jun 18 04:19:36 2015 UTC,Her job is basically to keep things on track and get them on and off stage quick. She's not doing standup.
southpark,3a7aih,abagofdicks,13,Thu Jun 18 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"Then what exactly is the point of having her there? Not like she's associated with South Park, clearly isn't a pro MC, don't see the purpose of the ""celebrity endorsement"" in this situation."
southpark,3a7aih,HungryGhosty,7,Thu Jun 18 06:09:50 2015 UTC,"She is a huge video game fan and probably well-known with that crowd because of work on Archer and other things. She is a comedian from San Francisco, so she is a relatable face and a video game advocate. She adds relatability and credibility to MCing something like this."
southpark,3a7aih,AMilitantPeanut,23,Thu Jun 18 12:12:16 2015 UTC,Then why is she making so many shit jokes?
southpark,3a7aih,Cirty_Dunt,9,Thu Jun 18 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why people keep saying that. I like her, and thought she did a pretty good job. It's a tough gig too."

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 29, 2000 and was rated TV-MA. The episode is a parody and comedic retelling of Charles Dickens's 1861 novel Great Expectations, and stars the South Park character Pip, who assumes the role of Pip, the protagonist of the novel, who is his namesake. ""Pip"" features no other regular characters from the show. The story is narrated in a live action parody of the anthology television series Masterpiece Theatre, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell.

To be fair that accent is pretty broad across England amongst the football hooligan, British gangster types.  Source: scouse family and live in England."

southpark,39ysws,KJM321,172,Tue Jun 16 12:16:04 2015 UTC,"Just a couple notes:   1: This isn't being made by the same developer as Stick of Truth. Keep that in mind.   2: I really hope they make the game longer than the original. I think they will, but who knows."
southpark,39ysws,shellbullet17,70,Mon Jun 15 23:21:05 2015 UTC,So true. I hope its much longer.. Id love to see final fantasy length but thats dreaming.
southpark,39ysws,duffmanhb,47,Mon Jun 15 23:24:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want it that long. I don't want the game to drag. Maybe 30 hours, and I'd be okay. If it's less, then I want more diversity and replayability. Have some larger differences in story choices and character classes. In the first game, both of those things mattered very little in terms of the outcome of the story and gameplay."
southpark,39ysws,Woyaboy,11,Mon Jun 15 23:36:21 2015 UTC,Even 30 may be a TAD to much to hope for. I just hope its 15+. I beat SoT in like 7 hours. It needed at LEAST twice as much content.   Having said that I have like 80ish hours logged on that game
southpark,39ysws,Janus67,6,Tue Jun 16 01:47:14 2015 UTC,"I thought the last one was perfect. They were able to focus on quality over quantity. Ever scene and battle was unique and funny, which made you feel like you weren't even playing a game. If they dragged it out any longer it'll just start sacrificing quality to extend it."
southpark,39ysws,KJM321,3,Tue Jun 16 13:03:01 2015 UTC,I highly recommended this title to a lot of my friends but I warned them it kinda plays like a babies first RPG.
southpark,39ysws,Janus67,24,Tue Jun 16 08:57:04 2015 UTC,I really don't think it needed to be any longer. The SoT length was pretty much perfect as you never really needed to grind and by the time you were getting bored with a setting you were moving on to another one.
southpark,39ysws,arron77,14,Tue Jun 16 03:07:23 2015 UTC,"I felt like it was a little too linear, and didn't have a ton of replayability. None of the choices you had to make in the game had any impact on the story. The class you pick only changed what your specials were. There were not many side quests. Had the game included more side quests, more replayability, more choice, it would have been absolutely amazing. But, what we got was a short RPG that's really only good for one or two playthroughs.  What I want is some story changing choice options, some substantial differences in character classes, and more side quests. Give me a reason to play through the game more than once. If they kept the length of the first game, but added this kind of variation, I'd be perfectly happy."
southpark,39ysws,Clestonlee,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:45:45 2015 UTC,That sounds excellent
southpark,39ysws,OhReseT,36,Tue Jun 16 10:52:06 2015 UTC,I thought the first game was a good length and probably about right to keep the content fresh etc
southpark,39ysws,hotstickywaffle,13,Tue Jun 16 00:28:53 2015 UTC,"It was a good length. I enjoyed the hell out of it, but they could have made the game longer. It was good for a first game though, hopefully they just expand on the framework although I realize it's a different studio."
southpark,39ysws,SdifOdh,6,Tue Jun 16 00:54:15 2015 UTC,"This makes me sad, the Stick of Truth was a great game. Hopefully this lives up to the hype."
southpark,39ysws,lobsterwithcrabs,3,Tue Jun 16 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"I hear complain about the length of the game a lot and I don't think I agree. I would have preferred if they gave more replay incentive than just making it longer. The only real reason I feel to play it a second time through is to try a higher difficulty or different class, but other than that there really is no reason to play a second time. You end up using basically the same gear and stuff every time, and the one small choice you get to make barely makes any difference."
southpark,39ysws,nazihatinchimp,2,Tue Jun 16 13:15:59 2015 UTC,I still think the game will be great although it's not the same studio. I don't think that Matt and Trey want to put a game on the market that isn't quality.

Then I saw it was $80 (CDN). Fuck. That.   Stick of Truth was awesome but it was short and does not have great replay value. There is no way I am pre-ordering ANY game for $80, let alone a game that may be short with little replay value."

southpark,39ysws,SAKUJ0,6,Tue Jun 16 06:41:30 2015 UTC,"I had SoT pre-ordered. No regrets.   let alone a game that may be short with little replay value.   It has about as much replay value as south park has ""rewatch"" value. For me it means a lot. No, you can't play it 3 times in a row. But I played it at least 3 times so far for the story."
southpark,39ysws,Bananas_n_Pajamas,5,Tue Jun 16 06:31:02 2015 UTC,"The first time I finished it I started a new game because I wanted to play as a wizard. I got about 5 minutes into it and had no desire to keep going.   About 6 months later I was bored and fired it up and it was great, I played it a second time and although it wasnt as funny as the first time it was still enjoyable and I still laughed out loud a few times.   Butters walking into the bank will get me everytime."
southpark,39ysws,d4x,2,Tue Jun 16 13:16:04 2015 UTC,The new prices cause of dollar conversions is $70.  Stick of Truth was that price everywhere I saw unless you got the version with the Cartman statue.

southpark,39ysws,infernalsatan,21,Mon Jun 15 22:45:46 2015 UTC,"Matt and Trey both say it is.  The MPAA deny it.   It's a widely reported myth that the original title of the film was ""South Park: All Hell Breaks Loose"" and the MPAA forced Trey Parker and Matt Stone to change the title, stating that all movie titles must be G-rated (despite the fact that there are many movies with the word ""hell"" in them - Hellraiser (1987), Hellfighters (1968), From Hell (2001), etc.). The story comes directly from Parker and Stone who claim that they submitted the film with the original title and were forced to change it. Richard Taylor, a spokesman for the MPAA, denies that any film was ever submitted with that title and that the MPAA did not reject the use of the word ""hell"" in the title.   Source."

If anyone hasn't seen the movie This Film Has Not Been Rated, check it out. It should give some insight to their process of accepting and rating movies.

southpark,39ysws,DatTomahawk,43,Mon Jun 15 22:32:11 2015 UTC,The game was worth every penny. The amount of South Park content was fucking huge.

southpark,39ysws,cptnpiccard,2,Tue Jun 16 00:07:59 2015 UTC,I feel like Ubisoft announced too early again. Stick of truth has only been out for a year and it got delayed like three times.
southpark,39ysws,bobweaver3000,2,Mon Jun 15 22:42:43 2015 UTC,I believe one of the big delays was the original publisher ended up going belly.
southpark,39ysws,Fabien_Lamour,2,Mon Jun 15 22:47:12 2015 UTC,Well they have a little bit less work to do. The overall template of the game is still the same.

southpark,39ysws,KurapikaKurta,2,Mon Jun 15 22:44:07 2015 UTC,They still announced it though which shows they are not close to finishing the game. I don't want this to end up like the Division where we have to wait forever and by the time of release there's no hype left.

In it they did some scenes where they redid stuff from the pilot but with the modern computer graphics they had at the time (season 5 or 6 maybe).    So one of the scenes they remade was the iconic scene of the alien probe coming out of Cartman's ass, except instead of a crude cardboard stop motion animation it was all done in CGI.  And the whole time they made sarcastic commentary in a voice over about how much better it was now that they changed it to CGI instead of, you know, just leaving the iconic original alone.

Most shows change a lot more over the course. i feel southpark still has the great satire that you'd find with great jokes. Its always inevitable for the originals to be better than the new, because the originals have a nostalgia factor. People are also more prone to like originals more, because ""its not the same"" when its just the time that has changed.  i guess im just trying to say all thats really changed is how it looks a bit, the quality of pure content hasnt changed to much. for me anyway."

Atleast the animation still has the same style, just cleaner(?)i guess  The old style also has more of a nostalgia attached to it.

southpark,39kh7v,Gewuerzwiesel,3,Sat Jun 13 00:15:25 2015 UTC,"1) Don't use booles on such simple objects. Almost your entire scene is comprised of (uneditable) primitives. Just make cuts/loops in the mesh to cut out your windows. Booles make a lot of extra work for your CPU that can be avoided by smart modeling. They have their uses, but, cutting squares and rectangles out of squares and rectangles is not one of them. Bad habit to get into, especially for large scale projects. I've had scenes become completely unresponsive with too many boole operations going on.  2) Get into the habit of using realistic measurements for your scenes. Render engines will provide better results when they know they're working with a 2"" wall, instead of a 2cm wall.  3) Hit up /r/Cinema4D for any help you need.  Keep going though. 3D modeling/rendering is a fucking blast. There are lots of ""rules of thumb"" you'll learn over the years that will help you so much along the way."

Trey and Matt sought her out for the role, but when they found her she had lost all the weight they had to hire Ruby Hart, a fat lady stripper, instead.

It also allows you to filter any subreddit out based on keywords. After doing this, occasionally things will slip through, but you can have your /r/all back without all the shitposts filling it up.  Best part is that since most of these ""subreddits"" where the spam comes from were only recently created, you don't have to worry much about having them blocked as they'll never be of any value. There are a few older subreddits which you'll want to block though since a lot of mods don't give a shit about the issue."

I just want my mom to live long enough to see her grandkids and for her to have that opportunity it needs to change now. Fph gave me somewhere to say that without being called as offensive as the unknowing self harm my family does to themselves.
southpark,39fmf3,f3tch,4,Fri Jun 12 06:08:09 2015 UTC,"I'm very sorry you're in that situation, but the overall impression I got from fph was that it was there to mock fat people, not help them or encourage them to look after themselves. I appreciate you found it a place to be able to vent your frustrations, but there are better places to do that which will actually be able to help you in your situation and not have to remove compassion from the situation."
southpark,39fmf3,delicious_grownups,2,Fri Jun 12 08:16:30 2015 UTC,Listen just tell your mom that. That you're afraid she's gunna die fat before her time. It'll help ti change things

southpark,39fmf3,OpenSign,0,Fri Jun 12 13:10:12 2015 UTC,That sub had common shared belief that fat people shouldn't even try to improve themselves. They should just die. It was a  toxic shit hole of bullies

How about in Baseketball?  He taunts the fatty in a cartman voice ""hey, if fucking fat, so fat""  anyways.  Its not obsession. It was all funny.  The passion you see here is 100% mistaken.

Why are they allowed to hate on black people and the handicapped, but i cant call a fatty a hambeast?   You can do that, in fact you basically just did. The real problem was that people were going outside of the sub to harass people. More importantly, though, Reddit isn't obligated to give you a platform to do that. Reddit isn't your house or business, it belongs to someone else. They don't owe anyone a platform from which to spout their bullshit. Matt and Trey didn't stop working with Comedy Central after they censored Muhammad did they? They just basically said ""fuck you"" and left it at that, and they only did so because CC was caving to the fear of violent retaliation. Reddit's not even doing that, they're just removing stuff they personally don't want here (which is the harassment primarily).  http://imgur.com/gallery/4l7j4Ly"

southpark,39fmf3,generaltsao,0,Fri Jun 12 00:13:07 2015 UTC,Welcome to Reddit
southpark,39fmf3,numerica,-2,Thu Jun 11 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Kinda sad, really."
southpark,39fmf3,generaltsao,13,Thu Jun 11 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have an opinion on those but if reddit said ""we don't want to support fetishizing dead peoples bodies"" only a monster would disagree"
southpark,39fmf3,numerica,10,Thu Jun 11 14:59:00 2015 UTC,"It's these types of polarizing statements that cause things to spiral out of control.   I am sure that Pao thought the same thing when pushing ahead with this decision.  The thing is, you always have to consider individual human and mob psychology.    I didn't agree with FPH because they made fun of people who have mental issues and need help.  That's how I view severely overweight people and I don't think making fun of them is a good thing at all.   But the thing is, people who actively made fun of those people are also severely insecure and need help.  It's also probably worth noting that the general demographic of that subreddit seemed to be leaning towards teenagers and young adults.  And what happens when you ban a gathering of 150K insecure young people who generally have a lot of time on their hands?    Any logical thinker could have predicted this backlash.  I am certain that reddit has some smart people in the upper management, but I think feelings and emotions got in the way.  Imgur got into a fight with FPH, FPH retaliated, then I am sure Imgur started calling Reddit and discussing feelings and emotions as well as some personal privacy and security concerns, and finally the banhammer was smacked down on ALL fat people hate subreddits.  They even banned those that just looked like fathate, such as /r/whalewatching.  They didn't even bother to look at the content and the subreddits before disabling them.  Does that seem like a rational thing to do or an emotional thing to do?   When you say ""only a monster would disagree"" that is an emotional statement.  I am not a fan of fetishizing dead people's bodies, but there are 'sick' people out there who are and for whom it's important.  Why should this community be based on rejecting 'sick' people?  It just seems to be a very weak thing to do."
southpark,39fmf3,generaltsao,3,Thu Jun 11 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the thoughtful reply. However, no one is surprised by the backlash. Plenty of the aggrieved are claiming reddit was ""stupid"" and lacked foresight but they, pardon my french, are the stupids. Every decision in 2015 is met with backlash, that's par for the course. Reddit, and myself, are going to ride out the backlash because these things are as predictable as the weather in Siberia.   Backlash will run out of steam, then a backlash to the backlash will start (hi, that's me) and then a backlash to that will start (I've encountered a few people who have called me a fat fuck and told me to kill myself) then after that, um, well I'm not a PR professional but conde nast is in NYC and NYC has MILLIONS of PR people who know this stuff top to bottom.  Also, no way, not going to defend the sick people who like dead bodies. You might as well defend Charles Manson, come off that angle, it doesn't make any sense. Sick people are sick, we don't have to feed their sickness though."
southpark,39fmf3,numerica,4,Thu Jun 11 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess my overall argument would be that yes, sick people are sick, but they need to be understood and helped, not isolated and rejected.  Sick people, if not helped, will continue to do sick things.  Ostracizing them from the community will only help those who feel 'uncomfortable' with them being around.  Why should your feeling of discomfort outweigh their need to be helped?  I don't know, that in itself seems pretty evil.    Regarding the backlash, when young people leave, the rest will follow.  As much as they are annoying sometimes, we gotta keep the youngins."
southpark,39fmf3,IHadaFishOnce,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"What don't you understand? They're sick, and they like to jerk off to dead bodies, but you want to keep them around and casually call me evil for wanting them gone? No dude, this isn't evil, this isn't lord of the rings, you're reducing your argument to fairy tale level (evil v good) when you start doing that, do yourself a favor and find a better term."
southpark,39fmf3,The_Funk_Soul_Brotha,2,Thu Jun 11 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"But you see, when you say things like that, it's like they are of a different species.  There is no empathy from you.  They are sick and that is that.  What do you call that then?"
southpark,39fmf3,IHadaFishOnce,8,Thu Jun 11 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"The problem was FPH drama seeping out into the reedit community. People writing derogatory posts on other subs, and taking self submissions from all across reddit (on different subs) and holding discussions regarding them.   It's like a situation where that corpse fetish community posting  creepy shit on /r/wtf threads about a girl being mauled or rotting in a ditch. I'm all for freedom of expression, but I'm absolutely against bullying"
southpark,39fmf3,The_Funk_Soul_Brotha,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about the bans, especially since there are far worse subs that made it through (/r/coontown gets to stay? really?). But from a marketing perspective it was a brilliant decision. Redditors will completely forget about this in three days, and the website will be far more marketable."
southpark,39fmf3,IHadaFishOnce,7,Thu Jun 11 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"Reddit will never be marketable. It's history is littered with huge controversies and rising communities built on hatred (in addition to all the cool communities the average consumer subscribes to). Every time one of these communities is banned, two more pop up, it will always be this way. And reddit will keep bringing in millions of users because the content on some of the better subs is consistent. There are thousands of God-awful subs on this website and you'll never be able to put a cap on it. But if your community's content starts to seep out into the other communities and people get offended, you will be banned. I don't see this as a marketing technique. Reedit wasn't meant to be marketable. It's just there. I don't understand why people are so sold on the idea that reedit is trying to attract new users or look good to the media. Reddit is enormous, it probably doesn't have much more room to grow. You can't hate reddit, because there's always at least one community you'll gravitate towards.   Idk, maybe I'm wrong. But I sure don't see what else reddit should've done with FPH"
southpark,39fmf3,The_Funk_Soul_Brotha,3,Thu Jun 11 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"They still need ad revenue, and a potential company sale to a lrager company is always an option. I know that having /r/coontown or /r/rcutefemalecorpses or whatever doesn't look good from an advertising perspective but at least they are mostly contained. /r/fatepoplehate had a six digit subscriber count and leaked constantly."
southpark,39fmf3,theonewhomknocks,2,Thu Jun 11 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"Well I can't make any case for those subs because I never heard about them. I personally heard about FPH because it leaked all over the place. I once saw a flame war commence between a FPH subscriber and someone on /r/getmotivated. And I saw another one on /r/pics and on /r/getmotivated. No one on coontown or cutefemalecorpses ever bothered me, in fact, they've been so low profile that i'm surprised they exist. Any mod from any site would've done the same thing to FPH. In fact, /r/Atheists was axed once they started getting traction, weren't they? No one batted an eye.   And as for the larger company case, i might actually consider migrating to Quora in the extremely off chance Reddit sells out."

Also, this: http://imgur.com/gallery/4l7j4Ly  Reddit doesn't have to host hateful subs any more than I have to host Westboro Baptist Church meetings in my home or office. But that's pretty irrelevant because they were removed for going outside their sub with harassment, not for being hateful.  Let's also all keep in mind that our beloved overlords Matt and Trey only went so far as to basically say fuck you to Comedy Central for censoring their Muhammad episode, but then kept on working with them because they understand that it's CC's right as a private company to decide what ideas they're willing to promote. You idiots might as well demand that Ruby Tuesday host and fund your KKK meeting while you're at it and see where that gets you. A private company doesn't have any responsibility or obligation to host/fund/promote your hateful bile and harassment just because you really want them to."

I guess you spend a lot of time protesting against youtube comments being pruned or disabled, and fight against every comment section of every website that doesn't allow you to spam it with hateful nazi propoganda? Or are you just pissed that reddit is no longer paying for a space where you can make fun of fat people to feel better about yourself?"
southpark,39fmf3,somewhatfunnyguy,3,Thu Jun 11 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"That was a lot of assumptions. I just asked you a question, was it too hard to answer?"
southpark,39fmf3,SilentRover,2,Thu Jun 11 21:58:56 2015 UTC,"If someone has a website they're paying for for some small business and someone comes along spamming their nazi propaganda, I have no problem with the business owner removing those comments. Now explain to me how that is different from what happened here, or do you think that the business owner should be obligated to leave the hateful spam on their website ""because free speech."" That's leaving aside the whole harassment issue involved with FHP (which is pretty relevant to what happened).  And I asked you a question too, but maybe it was too hard to answer. Do you have a problem with censorship universally or just in this case? In my example above, is the business owner obligated to leave up someone's hateful nonsense?  EDIT: I also really wonder how you're able to consider reddit removing FPH as censorship, but FPH removing any dissenting opinions somehow wasn't a problem? Or maybe I'm making too many assumptions again, but when you offer up no information I can only infer things, friend."
southpark,39fmf3,somewhatfunnyguy,0,Thu Jun 11 22:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, I believe corporations should also be obligated to leave up ""hateful"" comments. If you have a comment section, but only want some comments to be approved. Don't have a fucking comment section."

Yeah I don't see any reasonable way that that makes sense.  Anyway, I guess everything evens out for you with the FPH nonsense then because all reddit did was censor a community that was engaged in extreme censorship."
southpark,39fmf3,Wygar,0,Thu Jun 11 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"OK, didn't realize I was talking to a 5 year old. Let me explain.  The problem with corporate censorship is that we can loose freedom of speech, freedom of speech is important because we want people to express their opinions even if we don't agree with them. You see, if we censor opinions we don't agree with, we will not move forward as a society. Now, obviously with fatpeoplehate one can argue that this is not an important view, and we should not protect this viewpoint. However I will argue that every viewpoint is valuable and worthy protection, and that's why I am strongly against any kind of censorship. Now, you chose to throw common sense out of the window with your example, and I'm guessing you probably know that I would understand if a vet clinic somehow got overrun with nazi propaganda that they would have to censor it. That was not what I was talking about(and I think you know this).   Regarding FPH censoring their own subreddit, well, I think subreddits are quite different. Since when I go on /r/southpark I expect discussion of South Park, and not The Simpsons, I don't find that to be censorship rather categorizing. So when I go to fatpeoplehate I expect hate, not love. Get it?"

I actually can't defend any of them with a straight face and would want exactly none of those groups to ever speak for me in the first place.  Also I can't really put any of those groups in the same level as socialists, trade unionists and Jews, for some odd reason. Quite possibly because you don't have to be an asshole to belong to the last three."

I can.  Deleting the subreddit doesn't change any of these peoples views, it just does exactly what we are seeing, floods the rest of the site with their bullshit.  Fucktards will continue to be fucktards, these subreddits are like fucktard traps so they don't wander into the nicer subreddits ruining other communities.  I wasn't even aware fat people hate shit existed until the drama flooded out of their subreddit."

Reddit has gone to complete shit lately.This site used to be so promising and felt so free, but has now became what I hate most. A censored up, circle jerk, reposting, social media machine that bows to the demands of fat, tublr, SJWs. Several of sub reddits have gone private due to the moderators not agreeing with the admins that censored other subs. While I agree with the mods of those subs that censorship is not what this site needs, they too have ruined the experience. Either you allow all content (within legal means) or don't have any content at all. I no longer want to be a part of this site now that the CEO and Admins feel the need to water down reddit to make it seem more PC. FUCK YOU ADMINS!

And you thought asking your irrelevant question in an even less relevant subreddit would get you somewhere? 8Chan's doors are always open.

I can't think of how to express the same concept without an entire sentence. Maybe the word is being used for its succinctness rather than its dramatic qualities, like many other words."
southpark,39fmf3,kanfayo,7,Thu Jun 11 15:02:00 2015 UTC,"The word you're looking for is ""moderation""  The purpose of the moderator is to contain the flow of the content and promote a consistently good environment. Reddit always implied they wanted a positive environment without bullying or harassment and they've been true enough to it for a while. Now, why is there controversy here? Couple of reason, the big one being, that FPH was a sub promoting bullying and harassment. This is a chain of command problem because it's basically this huge stain/zit on a relatively progressive community that's been keeping their shit together long enough.   Censorship is the act of removing opinions you don't agree with. Moderation is taking away opinions that put a damper on the community or make it worse. Shadow banning every subscriber of FPH is censorship. Banning the sub reedit and letting the members and admins voice their opinions is moderation.   Censorship and moderation aren't mutually exclusive because a mod is essentially censoring content. But it's not 'bad' censorship by any sense of the word because it's a private community and they hold that power based on the guidelines. This form of censorship exists on every platform in the internet except the 5% that no one with a leve head would visit.   There are fat shaming websites you can fee free to join. I don't get this delusion that reedit has to let that shit slide on their site."
southpark,39fmf3,thabe331,3,Thu Jun 11 14:41:07 2015 UTC,"Censorship is the act of removing opinions you don't agree with  Moderating is to promote a consistently ""good"" environment   ""Good"" doesn't have a solid definition here. Good is subjective. How can someone promote a ""good"" environment without removing the ""bad"" aka, as you said, ""removing opinions you don't agree with.""  Moderation carries the implication that what is being removed is universally bad. If a moderator removes something one doesn't view as bad, because that mod views it as bad or disagrees with it, it isn't going to be said that the moderator was just moderating. Your own definitions indicate that it would be considered censorship from the person disagreeing with the fact that it is ""bad.""  Also:   Censorship is the act of removing opinions you don't agree with. Moderation is [removing] opinions that [in my opinion] put a snapper on the community or make it worse [and are therefore opinions that you don't agree with]"

Additionally, on pages such as Facebook, where personal information is often displayed, please mask the personal information and personal photographs using a blur function, erase function, or simply block it out with color.

southpark,39fmf3,L4UGH,3,Thu Jun 11 17:17:48 2015 UTC,"Rediquette is in regards to how each individual has a responsibility to act on their own terms and is a basis for shadowbanning, banning, or removing users or their content/comments.  Those rules are relevant to individual actions, and what is being discussed is a response which widely affected the enjoyment and community of over 100,000 people who weren't ""forgetting the human,"" doxxing, being rude, or attacking other commenters. Whether or not you find it morally reprehensible, you do not have the authority to declare the entire range of content in the sub ""bad"" in the sense that none of it should exist.  Our conversation involves the discussion of what content is good or bad to be allowed on the site. This encompasses the entirety of everything which exists in the known universe and every possible concept that can be conceived by the human mind which can be encompassed by picture, text, and video. Do not pretend that rediquette has such a scope.  However, I would totally agree with you if reddit went in and found the users who brigaded or supposedly doxxed people and banned them. Or if admins had a hand in shadowbanning users who were rude across the site rather than mods removing such people from their respective subreddits. But, what happened was the actions of a few, which did not line up with rediquette, became the basis for eliminating an entire community of 150k+. Rather than enforcing rediquette, rediquette became the basis for removing objectionable content in entirety. The community was deleted along with all of its content and dozens of similar concept subs were immediately deleted with their users shadowbanned with absolutely no indication or evidence that any of them had taken place in brigading or harassment or broke any rules of rediquette whatsoever.  So, yeah, rediquette is not relevant to this issue outside of the fact that it was perverted to be a basis to condemn and ban any kind of content or users related to a sub who had some members break the subreddit's rules and brigade other parts of the site and be assholes."

southpark,39fydm,detailed_fred,2,Thu Jun 11 13:37:58 2015 UTC,"Episode is in season 2, 'Hooked On Monkeyphonics'. I think it's somewhat of an underrated episode. It has some great little jokes hidden within it, and is representative of the phase when the boys were just boys with quite an adventurous collection of adjectives to describe each other.   This Holy Diver joke is one of those little South Park-isms, where they take the opportunity to show a stark juxtaposition between the cartoon world and the real world. Here, they portray Dio's lead singer as an ageing imbecile fool with a uniquely riddled voice. But the punchline lays in the deception of the character, as he belts out one of the most outrageously defining vocal timbers of 80s rock. They use this technique to great effect, especially in a later episode, in which they set the travesties of the Vietnam War to the wailing screams of Nancy Kerrigan, screaming ""Why?""  The juxtaposition of these two worlds just leave you confounded as a viewer, chuckling at the pure absurdity of it. It's even more beautiful as the moment's are often fleeting, leaving you little time to wonder ""What the hell was that?""  Just a testament to the writing power of Stone and Parker.  edit: just realised this is some fan edit clip, and not the full joke. Shit."

southpark,39fdcz,jorg3234,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"If you use Kodi, skipping with the up arrow will move you 30 seconds forward, pretty much exactly how long the intro is. Alternatively you could run a script that cycles through each episode and runs handbrake on it to convert it to a standardised mp4 and also trim the first 30 seconds. Would save some space but remember not all episodes have the title sequence exactly the same."

They were pretty sure that, just as they were animating Spielberg and Lucas raping Indian Jones, someone was animating Matt and Trey raping the boys. They said they had thought of doing that themselves, but couldn't figure out how to do it right, and made ""The China Probrem"" instead. :)  But in the Millennium edition of Rolling Stone, they said this:  RS: WILL SOUTH PARK BE DIFFERENT IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY?  TREY: Maybe there will be some baby-fucking.  MATT: We'll start the baby-fucking thing and then we'll get out.  — RS 830/831 (Millennium Edition  They got close to that with ""Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy"" :D"

southpark,38afvd,twalker294,100,Wed Jun 3 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"I mean between the Cissie episode and Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina, there's really no reason to retread old ground. If they do that for any other reason other than to move forward socially, it would just be a cheap retreat rather than covering any new ground.  That's what I liked about the Cissie episode, coming ten years after Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina. In ten years, it went from ""you're not really what you want to be"" to ""be whatever feels good, and if you're uncomfortable, use the other stall, cissie.""  The difference in their take of each side of the issue shows how much time has passed."
southpark,38afvd,Spartan152,22,Wed Jun 3 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"They've come a long way from making a character's struggles with sexual and gender identity the butt of a joke. Going back to Garrison would be tough because his transformation was something that was meant to be laughed at, unlike the Lorde saga which is sympathetic to the trans community."
southpark,38afvd,PeppyHare66,7,Wed Jun 3 05:44:48 2015 UTC,"Also, bringing up Jenner a good 4 months after the fact in September or October doesn't really jive with their topical M.O."
southpark,38afvd,ns156,6,Wed Jun 3 15:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yup agreed.   If Trey and Matt can find something new to laugh at they will do so otherwise they would just leave it alone, I'm guessing the humour here is more about the reactions from the homophobic rather than Jenner herself. The story has been spectacularly dull in so far that it seems everyone knew and all the public and media reactions to it have been dramatically predictable.  Lets face it,the humour in Garrisons sex change was in his own selfloathing hatred of fellow fags, not in the actual sex change. The Southpark boys have never been ones to pick the low hanging fruit. So unless they see an angle thats not been explored before I can't see them bothering."
southpark,38afvd,Soddington,12,Wed Jun 3 09:39:12 2015 UTC,"But garrison did it because hes a selfish mess of a prick, the cissie episode was because stan was honestly confused.  Sure its different times and stuff but still very different based on the characterization and context"

He apologized for it but it's still pretty lame.   That's why the Insheeption episode didn't describe the movie correctly. They never watched it. It is part of a worrying trend of laziness M and T have been on lately. Makes me wonder what else they didn't bother researching before making a show about it."

That doesn't stops him from technically being jewish.   He made a perfect macaroni art replica of The Last Supper, which you may know as a Christian painting.   You don't have to be a christian to make a replica of christian art. Also 100% of the people and rabbits depicted in that painting are jewish.   In 'Fatbeard', when Cartman Eric made his pirate gang to go to Somalia, he specifically said that no Jews or gingers were allowed to be in the group. He rejected a ginger who tried to join, but he allowed Ike in without any questions or hesitation.   Cartman's personal agendas are always more important to him than any of his racism.   He is never explicitly referred to as a Jew like Kyle and the rest of his family   That's true and could count to Ike no being a jew.  I'd say the ""normal"" baby-Ike is a Jew as much as a baby can belong to a religion. But at the times then he's more ""grown-up"" i woudn't be suprised if he would be an atheist or agnostic."

The NCAA literally makes billions,of dollars off the backs of student athletes that make no money at all in return. The vast majority of them will not see action in the pros and the amount of time that they spend making the NCAA money greatly affects their academic studies. The NCAA gets away with this by saying that they provide scholarships that help people get an education but yet they allow students to leave school after a year in basketball. Or as a junior in football.  I can't speak for other sports but football has an atrocious record of athletes graduating. Less that 50 percent in many cases. Along with the very serious injuries faced by those athletes, that's some serious issues after college.   And, not to mention that the pro organizations do everything they can to support this because it's free farming for athletes."

southpark,37udli,rsdtriangle,7,Sat May 30 19:40:08 2015 UTC,And beating the shit out of Zimmerman. But let's ignore that part.
southpark,37udli,GoldandBlue,-1,Sat May 30 19:52:08 2015 UTC,"Right because it's not like Zimmerman confronted Martin, maybe Martin was tanding his ground."
southpark,37udli,rsdtriangle,3,Sat May 30 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"So there's definitive proof of Martin attacking Zimmerman, but you're gonna go with ""maybe?"" And how do you know it wasn't Martin confronting Zimmerman?  If you had read up on the case you'd know that no one knows what happened in the time between Zimmerman calling and Martin attacking him. However, all of the evidence collected has corroborated Zimmerman's side of the story. Maybe George Zimmerman, the guy who had tutored black children and came to the defense of a black homeless man who was attacked by police when no one else would, cooked up a devious plan to shoot a black person, but I highly doubt it."
southpark,37udli,GoldandBlue,2,Sat May 30 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"No, there is definitive proof there was a comfrontation. Yes, Zimmerman is a victim. He followed a young man despite police advisement, he beat up his girlfriend, he has been in and out of prison, but Martin totally had it coming, its amazing the logic circles people create. You know what would have happened if Zimmerman would have minded his own Damn business? Trayvon Martin would still be alive and no one would know his or Zimmermans name. But lets make Zimmerman a victim because he decided to start a confrontation with some kid trying to getbhime from school."
southpark,37udli,HeNeverLies4,-3,Sun May 31 00:00:31 2015 UTC,"So there's definitive proof of Martin attacking Zimmerman, but you're gonna go with ""maybe?   There is proof there was an altercation. Zimmerman could have attacked Trayvon and simply got the upper hand in the altercation. You don't know what happened specifically and you shouldn't speak like it."
southpark,37udli,kryptkeeper17,3,Sat May 30 20:41:40 2015 UTC,You're right they are different. The kid was shot in the back while running away meanwhile Trayvon was shot close range while engaged with Zimmerman

Is Trayvon not allowed to defend his life? If some psycho was creeping up on me with a gun I'd want to neutralize that threat as well.
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-9,Sun May 31 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, He was on neighborhood watch. They keep watch on the neighborhood. It's what they do. It's not like Zimmerman was brandishing his weapon either.   When a cop pulls someone over (keep in mind they too have a big scary loaded gun) beating their face to a pulp is not an appropriate response and you certainly wouldn't consider it self defense."
southpark,37udli,the_jackson_2,3,Sun May 31 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring that the dispatcher specifically told Zimmerman to stop following Trayvon. Zimmerman initiated the encounter, and so is morally responsible for the resulting death."
southpark,37udli,OneSoggyBiscuit,7,Sun May 31 01:07:40 2015 UTC,It's not the neighborhood watch's job to follow a black kid around who did nothing.
southpark,37udli,flyryan,1 point,Sat May 30 23:47:39 2015 UTC,He wasn't on watch at the time. He was driving through the neighborhood while on an errand. He was the neighborhood watch coordinator but to say he was on patrol and just came across Trayvon is inaccurate.
southpark,37udli,theroyalalastor,1 point,Sun May 31 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah and he was told specifically by the police not the engage but did anyway. Don't compare Zimmerman to a cop, he is not a cop."
southpark,37udli,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,1 point,Sun May 31 00:09:43 2015 UTC,"A cop has a uniform and a special car to tell me they have the right to pull me over. Any power-hungry dickhead can be, or claim to be, neighborhood watch, it's not comparable being pulled over by a cop and being followed by just some guy with a gun."
southpark,37udli,Riptide_,6,Sun May 31 00:20:35 2015 UTC,It's 2015 and people are still defending Zimmerman.
southpark,37udli,rsdtriangle,1 point,Sun May 31 00:25:32 2015 UTC,I know. Amazing that people still read facts and form opinions based on the truth.
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-11,Sat May 30 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is the year. What are you trying to say?"
southpark,37udli,Riptide_,-5,Sat May 30 20:25:15 2015 UTC,I'm saying many people should have matured enough to know that Zimmerman is not free of faults.
southpark,37udli,ChronaMewX,3,Sat May 30 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"I bought this narrative. Why the hell would Trayvon be smashing Zimmerman's head on to the concrete? Why would he be the one to jump him? If he really did bash his head into concrete, shouldn't he have at least seen a doctor after the incident? I've seen the pictures of his head afterwards and there were two tiny holes, he very well might have just hit his head on the car door after murdering Trayvon"
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,5,Sat May 30 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"Well they had this big trial see, you may have heard of it.  During the trial they put together the events of that night based on the evidence."
southpark,37udli,ChronaMewX,-7,Sat May 30 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"Seeing as the trial got the verdict wrong, I'm not going to trust it. As we've seen in the news recently, cops and elected officials are above the law. Zimmerman is the son of a judge - that's the only reason he wasn't sent to jail for assaulting a cop a few years back, and it's the only reason he wasn't indicted for murdering Trayvon. The cops didn't even question him at the scene because of it, they just let him go free. That's the reason the protests started, because they didn't even want to investigate to gather this evidence you're so sure of"
southpark,37udli,HerroimKevin,11,Sun May 31 19:25:04 2015 UTC,Yeah it's not like he profiled a kid who was picking up food for his brother as a thief. Ten when confronted he pulls a gun and shoots him. Totally nothing wrong.
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-2,Sat May 30 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"That false narrative has no basis in reality  I watched basically every day of that trial and the prosecution had nothing, absolutely nothing. It would have never made it to trial without the media race baiting. For one, it was determined Trayvon was the aggressor and was pummeling Zimmerman's head in on the sidewalk. The neighborhood had a history of breaks in and after all Zimmerman was neighborhood watch and was doing his job. There is no evidence at all that points towards Zimmerman being a racist.  If you honestly believe what you said, then you have been duped or you're ignorant of the situation."
southpark,37udli,The_Fan,4,Sat May 30 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"It's not neighborhood watches job to confront people you fucking moron. He was the aggressor. The 911 operator told him not to follow him and he did anyway, he got away with murder."
southpark,37udli,dhicock,6,Sun May 31 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"Not saying I feel one way or the other, but technically, you are not required to follow the orders of the 911 operator and cannot use that as a basis for someone doing something.   If the operator told you to stay put and you got killed, you can't put liability on the operator. They are just there to try and keep you safe, but you are under no obligation to follow what they say.  This is not to say he should have pursued or stayed, just that using the operator is irrelevant as they have no authority for him to be following."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,4,Sun May 31 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"The 911 operator told him not to follow him and he did anyway   If you watched the trial you would know that when the operator told him not to follow, he began to head back to his vehicle. On the way back he was jumped by Trayvon."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,3,Sat May 30 20:36:58 2015 UTC,except murder a kid
southpark,37udli,ajac09,-1,Sun May 31 01:20:08 2015 UTC,"Well the Jury didn't seem to think so. Keep in mind they had access to all the evidence from both sides, not just left wing media shit that you've gladly lapped up."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-2,Sat May 30 20:38:36 2015 UTC,It really is. As stated he profiled someone because of their color. if it been a white kid this would have NEVER happened.
southpark,37udli,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,3,Sat May 30 20:47:05 2015 UTC,There isn't a shred of evidence that points to Zimmerman being racist. Sorry man.
southpark,37udli,ZimeaglaZ,-2,Sat May 30 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"Except for, you know, seeing a black kid existing and immediately thinking ''there's a criminal'' and calling the cops before following him like a stalker. But hey, nothing racist about that, I' sure he calls the cops on every person he sees walking around and follows them with his gun."
southpark,37udli,CynicalCoffee21,8,Sat May 30 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"Zimmerman fought for justice after a black homeless man was nearly beaten to death by the police chief's son.   He went to black neighborhoods and churches to spread awareness for this...  There had been a string of robberies in the neighbor, one which involved a home invasion.  And if you listen to the 911 calls. ..when the operator asked him about the race of the person he said "" I think he's black""   So, by that...he wasn't even sure of the race.  If you disagree with the trial, that's cool... but , don't just lie about shit."
southpark,37udli,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,7,Sat May 30 20:54:17 2015 UTC,"First if all, how do you know what he was thinking? Second of all, treyvon fit the description for an actual criminal who committed a theft in the area, it wasn't because he was out hunting for black people to criminalize. The mistake is a perfectly understandable one."
southpark,37udli,CynicalCoffee21,3,Sat May 30 20:02:58 2015 UTC,''Fit the description'' of a black guy. Classic.
southpark,37udli,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,0,Sat May 30 20:11:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah a black male in, ""A dark hoodie, like a grey hoodie, and either jeans or sweatpants and white tennis shoes."" A bit more specific than you are implying."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,3,Sat May 30 21:34:24 2015 UTC,A hoodie and either jeans or sweatpants? You mean like what every young person wears?
southpark,37udli,SociableSociopath,-3,Sat May 30 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"He was a neighborhood watchman, that it what the job entails, looking for suspicious characters. The neighborhood had a history of break ins so it's not out of the ordinary that he might want to stop an unfamiliar hooded figure walking around at night in the rain. If he was white teen in a hoodie it wouldn't have made a difference he would probably have still been stopped too.  Maybe if Trayvon didn't attack him like a fucking animal, they could have exchanged words, find out it's a misunderstanding, and move on."
southpark,37udli,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,3,Sat May 30 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"Can we be clear that neighborhood watch is not a job, it's a hobby. Stop acting like it is some official position."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,1 point,Sun May 31 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"Oh now he's an animal? I guess if you don't think of him as human it's easier to justify his murder. I don't know about you but when I spot a psychopath with a gun creeping behind me, my first reaction is not to try to engage him in intelligent conversation.  I love how you think following people and eventually shooting them is fine by you because the neighborhoods had had break ins, but taking action to neutralize someone creeping after you with a loaded gun is just way over the line. It's almost like anything that Zimmerman did was just being careful, but anything that Trayvon did is automatically the crazy, animalistic instincts of a violent criminal..."
southpark,37udli,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,0,Sun May 31 16:35:42 2015 UTC,Trayvon didn't know he had a gun that night. Otherwise he wouldn't have assaulted him.  It's not like Zimmerman was eager to shoot off his gun that night.
southpark,37udli,bumnut,2,Sat May 30 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"Well eager or not he certainly managed to, he created a situation in which he had a ''right'' to shoot the kid. If he hadn't assumed him to be a criminal none of this would have happened."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-3,Sat May 30 20:18:31 2015 UTC,There was this one time he shot a black kid.
southpark,37udli,OneSoggyBiscuit,0,Sat May 30 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"Gee, he just should have let Trayvon crack his skull open on the pavement. Wouldn't want to be a racist and defend his life."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-1,Sat May 30 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, if I found someone following me with a loaded gun I'd probably do nothing. There's not a single reason why I would fear for my life. Just walking back to my house and some random dude has his gun ready to point at me, I wouldn't think he wanted to shoot me."
southpark,37udli,3xAmazing,1 point,Sat May 30 20:39:14 2015 UTC,You make it sound like Zimmerman was waving his gun around like a lunatic. It was concealed. Trayvon likely never knew Zimmerman was armed (if he did he probably wouldn't have jumped him in the first place)
southpark,37udli,OneSoggyBiscuit,0,Sun May 31 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"Except that he did. The whole phone call to his girlfriend where he says "" hey this scary guy is following me"" then hangs up. Then dies."
southpark,37udli,ChronaMewX,0,Sun May 31 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, then as a concealed carry you do not go looking for trouble. You don't follow people and you don't cause someone to feel scared for their life."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-5,Sun May 31 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"He called the cops on black people multiple times before the trial. As we've seen from interactions between cops and black people in the news lately, that's basically the same as sentencing them to death. The only difference with Trayvon was that ""these people always get away"", so he took the law into his own hands and was the one to deal the lethal blow"
southpark,37udli,The_Fan,-2,Sat May 30 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"He called the cops on black people multiple times before the trial.   How dare he, what a racist!... Oh please.   As we've seen from interactions between cops and black people in the news lately, that's basically the same as sentencing them to death.   Could you be anymore dramatic?   ""these people always get away""   Pretty obvious he was referring to criminals in the neighborhood not all black people. Pretty sure Zimmerman even dated a black girl once upon a time."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,2,Sat May 30 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"He wasn't a criminal! It's not obvious that he was talking about criminals, because he wasn't. He's a racist piece of shit wife beater. That's who your defending."
southpark,37udli,The_Fan,3,Sun May 31 15:15:38 2015 UTC,"The context made it pretty clear that Zimmerman was upset that the people doing breakins lately always get away.   He's a racist piece of shit wife beater.   I love the fact that you have no evidence whatsoever to back up these claims. Nothing ever came of that domestic violence report either. The girl couldn't keep her story straight, pretty obvious she twisted the truth."
southpark,37udli,ajac09,1 point,Sun May 31 16:24:50 2015 UTC,"Black kid =/= criminal. Unless you're a racist piece of shit. All the evidence you need is right there. When he says ""they"" he means blacks."
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,-6,Sun May 31 17:51:36 2015 UTC,Lets see he followed the kid around because he was black.. what more proof do you need?
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,3,Sat May 30 20:29:52 2015 UTC,You can't prove that. Nothing about Zimmerman's history tells us he is racist at all.
southpark,37udli,ajac09,-6,Sat May 30 20:37:01 2015 UTC,Cool I have opinions. No way.
southpark,37udli,Retarded_Goyim,0,Sat May 30 21:18:03 2015 UTC,cant prove your way either. Zimmermans history tells us he is a wannabe hero who threatens women and has an ego. him profiling that kid shows he has some racism in him and goes along wtih the ego and hero complex.
southpark,37udli,ajac09,-1,Sat May 30 21:28:37 2015 UTC,Tons of people were questioned about Zimmerman's character during the trial. There is no reason to believe he is a racist.
southpark,37udli,OneSoggyBiscuit,-5,Sat May 30 22:00:12 2015 UTC,and yet he is one.  If the kid had been white he probably would have ignored him and moved on. That alone is proof he is racist even if its minor. Just because you couldnt find anything in his past doesn't mean anything. Their are plenty of racist people black and white who show no signs of it till the first time.

southpark,37v5cq,CyrexCore2k,7,Sat May 30 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's apparent why they picked Hulu: their own site's player wasn't really making them much money (especially since most people use adblock), and a partnership with Hulu can bring them a lot more profit, as well as the ability to have a bunch of free episodes on rotation.  Netflix they run into the problem of having every single episode behind a paywall. This might not be a big deal since Netflix is already very popular, but SP has a lot of fans in countries that don't really have netflix or easy access to credit cards for online purchases, so it wouldn't really be very fair.  Really, if Hulu didn't have abysmal service (getting frequent AND really long ads even after I pay a monthly fee? No thanks), this wouldn't be a problem, but sadly it's currently their best choice to both not have everything behind a paywall and continue making a living off of it."

""There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more.
