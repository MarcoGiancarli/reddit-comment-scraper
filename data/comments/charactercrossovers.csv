A radioactive spider than bites our hero and he is given superhuman abilities. It is impossible to give more people these powers because the spider escapes and nobody knows what kind of radiation is needed to make a new one.

The Nazis tried to recreate the serum, but, because they aren't able to figure out the proper equation, instead end up creating incredibly disfigured insect/human mutants that are so unstable their bodies breakdown within days or weeks at the most.

charactercrossovers,2y2j0w,epicLeoplurodon,3,Fri Mar 6 04:00:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I merely wanted to draw the X-Men out of a roster of newsprint or cartoon character children. In many cases, the selection was arbitrary though, if an opportunity presented itself to match a character to another based on appearance (like Dexter to Banshee, or Mr.Magoo to Xavier) or ethnicity (Stan, being Jewish, was cast as Magneto, Curtis as Bishop), I took it. But, in many cases, a character was just assigned. Charlie Brown as Wolverine was due to 1.) CB's yellow and black Chevron shirt is slightly similar to Wolverine's classic costume and 2.) It struck me as funny, given Wolverine is a hard ass, and Charlie Brown is a lovable little guy whom no one respects.   Who would you have cast, if I may ask?"

charactercrossovers,2y2j0w,carsausage,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"Imo I think the best casting is Hobbes as Cannonball, but I think a super-straight edge character could be Cyclops and Stewie could be Northstar (because he's gay) or Juggernaut (for the head).

You're sabotaging his plans in ways you can trying your hardest to pass the 7 years until the Hero awakens to make his final fight with the Gerudo King easier.  Ending cinematic is you changing out to Zelda and giving Link the Light Arrow before being encased in a crystal.

TMNT and Ghostbusters (as cartoons) are a little later, but are also pretty close, although their taking place in the modern era makes them a little bit less of a fit.  Same with G.I. Joe, and I wasn't really allowed to watch that show, so it wasn't as big of a thing for me, but that's just me.  Voltron crossed my mind, and I think it might be the best possible answer!

charactercrossovers,2fldan,TerriblyUnfortunate,3,Sat Sep 6 01:38:54 2014 UTC,Yeah I'll give it a shot. Is it anything like Adventure Time? And if I end up hating it I'm totally holding you responsible.... joking.
charactercrossovers,2fldan,Mzmonyne,3,Sat Sep 6 02:32:02 2014 UTC,"It's makes more sense than Adventure Time, but in some ways it's almost as crazy, and, like Adventure Time, there's stuff in each episode that you have to really look for that adds to the overall story of the show so much. As you watch it, remember these words: ""He's always keeping one eye on you.""  I have a comment I posted before where I sum up the premise of the show. Check around my profile for it. I'll try to find it.  Found it:   Gravity Falls is a spectacular cartoon on Disney Channel (yes, really) about two kids (a boy named Dipper and a girl named Mabel) staying with their great uncle Stan in the boring town of Gravity Falls, Oregon for the summer. Dipper finds a mysterious book in the woods filled with notes and sketches on supernatural creatures and the dark history of the town, and a unsettling message: ""TRUST NO ONE!"" Very soon, Dipper and Mabel start to realize that the town is definitely not what it seems."

charactercrossovers,28m45t,ShasneKnasty,2,Sat Jun 21 00:37:23 2014 UTC,"I'm also a few minority that thinks superman has more raw power though. in a non powered fight goku wins, but I think supes exerts more power. It would be a lot closer tha 90% of people give credit for."
charactercrossovers,28m45t,finakechi,1 point,Sat Jun 21 02:02:07 2014 UTC,I'm actually not sure who would win.   I'm thinking it's closer to 50/50 than most people think.

charactercrossovers,28m45t,finakechi,1 point,Sat Jun 21 17:19:58 2014 UTC,The problem with Superman is that there is so many different versions of him. And which version you use has his powers fluctuate wildly.   There is only one Goku.
charactercrossovers,28m45t,bfiiitz,1 point,Sat Jun 21 18:52:05 2014 UTC,"Superman spent years in the fortress of solitude being trained by his dad in kryptonian martial arts. Also in all these years of training for goku, he doesn't really learn strategy, only how to go really fast, punch really hard and shoot bigger lasers. If I'm wrong please correct, it's been a while since I rewatched db or dbz"

charactercrossovers,21ihxz,soundtribe007,3,Thu Mar 27 16:02:00 2014 UTC,Good lord SuperHulk would be strong...
charactercrossovers,21ihxz,VorDresden,7,Thu Mar 27 21:33:23 2014 UTC,But Spider-Bat had the world's saddest backstory and the world's strongest plot armor.
charactercrossovers,21ihxz,nonuniqueusername,4,Thu Mar 27 22:00:38 2014 UTC,"I've been thinking a lot about the ""reality"" of these crossovers, and yes SuperHulkMan (as I have taken to calling him) would absolutely crush.  How would the addition of the Hulk affect Superman's kryptonite weakness?  Does Batman need all those wonderful toys when he has Spidey powers?  Why can't I stop thinking about this?"
charactercrossovers,21ihxz,VorDresden,3,Thu Mar 27 22:54:00 2014 UTC,So by my understanding green kryptonite makes Superman slightly weaker than an average human. So SuperHulkMan would be slightly weaker than the average Hulk. Which means still absurdly strong since Hulk is often seen as stronger than Supes
charactercrossovers,21ihxz,nonuniqueusername,1 point,Thu Mar 27 23:31:49 2014 UTC,"Kryptonite radiation changes and/or kills superman.  Hulk emits gamma radiation.  Both are fictional from different universes.  If they are similar, does the Hulk radiation change the Superman part?

charactercrossovers,1w7iv2,onedrummer2401,3,Sun Jan 26 21:29:05 2014 UTC,"First off, it's pretty stupid and immature to call a version a character you don't like""fake whoever"" and second, the characters in this image are the movie versions, you can find an alternate with the comic versions as well."
charactercrossovers,1w7iv2,TastyBrainMeats,0,Sun Jan 26 22:22:15 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, but the guy running around calling himself ""Bane"" was no more true to the comic-book character than Arnold Schwartzenegger was as Mr. Freeze.  Less, really, because at least Arnie kept the Animated Series origin of the character, and didn't have him serving as a patsy for the League of Assassins."
charactercrossovers,1w7iv2,onedrummer2401,1 point,Mon Jan 27 00:33:13 2014 UTC,"You don't seem to understand the word adaptation. Yes. Tom Hardy's character was bane. No, it was not cannon. No, there is no combination of words that will make that change. I don't like Arnold's Mr. Freeze or Uma Thurman's Ivy, but I don't call them ""fake"". Tom Hardy's Bane has always come across to me as more intimidating than any of the TV show or game adaptation. I like the comic bane, but a Spanish/mexican accent on a super villain has always sounded slightly comical to me."
charactercrossovers,1w7iv2,TastyBrainMeats,-2,Mon Jan 27 01:34:57 2014 UTC,"If you made a ""Superman"" movie where he got his powers from exposure to a glowing green mineral, where he was born and raised in Metropolis, and where he always killed his enemies, I think I'd be justified in calling the protagonist ""not really Superman""."
charactercrossovers,1w7iv2,onedrummer2401,1 point,Mon Jan 27 01:43:53 2014 UTC,"They probably wouldn't get the rights to make that movie, and it would flop. TDKR however, did not flop, no one calls Heath Ledger's character ""fake"" joker, and Bane's origin is actually not even fully disclosed in TDKR, as the assumed origin for most of the movie is revealed to be for another character.  Heath's joker never fell into a vat of acid because it wasn't realistic in the Nolanverse. Bane didn't have an addiction to venom because a steroid that instantly changes your bone and muscle structure and is reversible is also not realistic. However, a very strong man trained by the League of Shadows who uses a mask filled with anesthetic gas to numb the pain of a facial disfigurement is fairly realistic. Nolan's Bane is still strong, still smart (despite plot loopholes) and still breaks batman's back.  There's a difference in an adaptation and a rewrite that doesn't capture the core of the character. Plus, there's a lot more leeway to adapt villains than the actual heroes.  Nolan's Bane is a realistic Bane adaptation, so there's really no reason to be petty and childish just because you didn't like the movie or the adaptation of that character. Being in that level of denial is honestly akin to sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting ""lalalala I can't hear you"". It's one the most childish things I can imagine.   Bane was my personal favorite part of TDKR, Talia was my least. I don't go and say ""fake Talia"" because it'd be stupid and I'm come across as a fan boy who can't bear to see his precious favorite medium be adapted or altered in any way. It's pathetic, really."
charactercrossovers,1w7iv2,TastyBrainMeats,-1,Mon Jan 27 01:58:45 2014 UTC,"The problem with TDKR is that Talia makes Bane into a sham.  Bane is not a gofer. He's not a patsy or a bodyguard. The essence of Bane is that he is the man who deserves to rule the underworld, by his strength and his intelligence.  That's why he went after Batman in the first place, way back when in Knightfall - to prove it to himself and everyone, that no-one was better than Bane.  Any adaptation that loses that loses the point of the character."
charactercrossovers,1w7iv2,onedrummer2401,0,Mon Jan 27 03:17:22 2014 UTC,"He went to Gotham because he had a vision of himself saying he had to kill a bat like creature. While I absolutely hate how Talia de-emphasized Bane's role, the movie doesn't necessarily state that Bane was working below Talia, they could've certainly been accomplices.   Bane in Arkham origins transforms into a mindless monster with memory problems, but it's still Bane. Bane in Batman forever is a plant zombie goon with next to no mental capacity, yet as much as I hate to say it, it's still Bane. It's not cannon, and the comics don't have to acknowledge them, but pretending ""Oh that's some other character, not actually Bane"" is childish and petty. It is Bane, whether you like it or not, because some people will like it, and some people won't. And if you took a survey that had a picture of Tom hardy's character and said ""is this Bane?"" you'd find an overwhelming majority saying yes. Because while you obviously are a comic book reader who votes no, there are other comic book readers who will vote yes, such as me, plus all the millions of people who don't read comics and still saw the movie who would also vote yet. So, since you're not God of all things Batman, and since some people will agree and some people will disagree, the ultimate verdict is yes, it is a version of bane. It doesn't have to he your favorite, but if I make a version of bane who's Viatnamese and came from a wealthy family only to be kidnapped and never had the ransom paid for, yet managed to escape and while homeless got addicted to a lesser version of venom, finally taking money to be in an experimental trial for venom that makes him super strong, it would still be Bane.  When I think Joker I think Lee Bermejo and Nolan's Joker, not Hamill's. I like that Joker better, but since Hamill's doesn't have facial scars I don't get to say he's fake Joker. You don't have the authority to claim real or fake."

charactercrossovers,1vvpkg,Zennistrad,0,Thu Jan 23 01:34:44 2014 UTC,That was a damn good comic. Shame the other 2099 comics were shit.
charactercrossovers,1vvpkg,RyantheAustralian,2,Thu Jan 23 03:22:55 2014 UTC,"I loved them all, especially x-men 2099. Spider-man 2099 is one of my favourites, and i think that his costume is one of the best of all time"
charactercrossovers,1vvpkg,huningtonhoodlum,2,Thu Jan 23 08:06:41 2014 UTC,Really wish I could get a poster sized one of these.
charactercrossovers,1vvpkg,TragicEther,2,Thu Jan 23 00:45:11 2014 UTC,Isn't there a /r/ImaginaryJedi subreddit that this would be perfect for?  Cool pic by the way
charactercrossovers,1vvpkg,Soft_Tacos_4_Me,1 point,Thu Jan 23 14:34:31 2014 UTC,This is one of the coolest mashups of all time.  This just makes sense.
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,Zero00430,5,Wed Jan 22 10:30:38 2014 UTC,"Hey, they're both Disney properties, right?  I smell a one-shot...."
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,vagued,6,Wed Jan 22 16:03:07 2014 UTC,"While we're on the topic, who would win in a fight- Stitch or a Xenomorph?"
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,yuloforce,8,Wed Jan 22 13:22:23 2014 UTC,"Stitch seems to have somewhere around the 10 ton strength rating, and while he seems quite agile and adept at hand to hand combat, his offensive capabilities seem to be limited to wielding his opponents' weight against them. I would imagine he'd have no problem grappling and throwing a xenomorph for quite a distance, but whether that would effectively kill or deter a xenomorph is difficult to determine and highly circumstantial.  I feel that if stitch's combat tactics were adjusted to be more aggressive that he could handily dispatch most aggressors, including xenomorphs or even Venom."
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,JViz,6,Wed Jan 22 21:43:00 2014 UTC,"If stitch weighed 80 pounds, he'd lift 240,000 pounds. That's 120 tons."
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,JesseisWinning,3,Wed Jan 22 22:48:38 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I just started watching the movie again; he said ""3000 time his weight"". That little girl could pick him up though, right? So I'm guessing more like 40lbs."
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,JViz,3,Thu Jan 23 00:09:47 2014 UTC,What's the environment like and does stitch have access to weapons?
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,DVentresca,5,Wed Jan 22 23:59:23 2014 UTC,It's the spaceship from the first Alien movie. Stitch is wearing his adorable little jumpsuit and has the hilariously ineffective plasma blasters from the movie.
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,yuloforce,2,Thu Jan 23 00:03:13 2014 UTC,"The plasma blasters are generally shown to be effective on typical threats in the movie, stitch is just that damn tough."
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,DVentresca,2,Thu Jan 23 00:30:42 2014 UTC,"He would McGyver a weapon, like a flame thrower."
charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,DVentresca,2,Tue Jan 28 23:50:44 2014 UTC,"Stitch is like Peter Parker, everyone forgets his intelligence."

charactercrossovers,1vuc3m,fantastic4skin,2,Wed Jan 22 10:30:50 2014 UTC,Really nice picture.  Just wondering if its possible to get it in a bigger resolution?

charactercrossovers,1vp0dg,tone_is_everything,9,Mon Jan 20 19:30:29 2014 UTC,"""Go ahead, make your move big guy. And dont think your huffing and puffing are gonna scare me one bit. Im already 17 moves ahead of you and there is nothing you can do to win. No, make that 18 moves. Go ahead Hulk..I'm waiting."" Fury squinted his uncovered eye and stared at the near ton of green fur and emotions before him.  The Hulk snarled ""You wont like me when I'm an...""  ""What? Angry? Oh, go ahead, get angry and you will lose. I stay cool, and I always win.""  Hulk leans closer and peers at Fury. The Director has a feeling he was getting too close for comfort and quickly pulls his gun.  ""Ah ah ahhh, Nope. Stay back.""  ""FINE!"" Hulk stood up. ""H SEVEN!!!!!!""  ""Son of a...you sank my battleship.""   The door to the common area aboard the Triskellion hisses open as Black Widow enters. Her face calm and collected she makes a beeline for the  now dancing Hulk and deflated Nick Fury.   ""Director Fury, I have."" ""I know""  ""But how? So you also know about the...""  ""Yup.""  ""And the possible reprisal by the...""  ""Yes, that too.""  ""Sir, how do you know...""  ""Because im that good.""  A loud commotion is heard in the hall and the three turn.  Tony Stark, the Ironman can be clearly heard above the conversation. ""Look I know that where you come from that is probably perfectly fine. But all I am saying  is on Earth.""  ""Midgard"" Thor interrupts.  ""Whatever, you crazy space viking,  Here on EARTH, thats fat. And I am a genius so when I use the term Alco-Paleo Diet, I know exactly what I'm talking about.""  Captain America enters the room first. As if he is running from the way over his head discussion. He quickly stands at attention before Fury. ""Director Fury, you said it was urgent. Terrorist attack? Hydra? ALIENS??!?!?""  Fury raises an eyebrow. ""No Cap, something worse.""  From across the room, ""A birthday party."" Everyone stops and turns to see Hawkeye adjusting a strap on his boots.  ""Like always Hawkeye, you nailed it. Bullseye.""  Hawkeye jumps and pulls his bow and scans the room. ""WHERE!?!?!""  Fury raises a hand to calm him down. ""No,I mean you're right. It is a birthday party. How did you know that?""  Hawkeye looks away as if back into his dark past. He sighs deeply.  ""Well sir, I do lots of reading when I'm alone and thinking about my past. It all started when...""  Ironman clears his throat. "" Nobody cares buddy. So Fury, You pulled us all the way up here for an invite to a birthday party?""  ""Not just any party Tony. The president of Wakanda is throwing a party for one of his many nephews. Everybody will be there. Many top agents from other organizations and possibly criminals, but one in particular will be there and we need to stop him and any plans he has. The Taskmaster.""  Captain America looks confused. ""Whats a Taskmaster?""  Black Widow steps forward. ""Only the founder of the most deadly and elite school for henchmen and criminals on the planet. You ever wonder where all those bad guys find such well trained soldiers to fill their ranks? If you need muscle and highly trained muscle the Taskmaster is your guy.""  ""She's right and at this party he will be recruiting new members and looking for clients""  ""Smash?"" The Hulk questions.  ""No Hulk, we aren't going to be smashing anybody. I need you to go and get recruited. We need you to get in and take him down from the inside.""  Ironman make a loud annoyed sigh and throws his hands up and wide open.   ""Grea! First a kids birthday party then I have to go back to school? Good thing I added that Mojito button to this new suit model.""  THIS SUMMER. Avengers: Boot camp."

charactercrossovers,1vkcdv,ReCursing,4,Sun Jan 19 11:50:31 2014 UTC,If you like music or car chases then watch them. Even better if you like both!
charactercrossovers,1vkcdv,drewgood,2,Sun Jan 19 14:54:16 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, that movie has to have the best car chases in history"

charactercrossovers,1vj6ws,Blumpkinsworth,5,Sat Jan 18 22:52:00 2014 UTC,Now I am not the expert of 90's but I am pretty sure Kung-Fu Panda and Madagascar came out in the 00's and not in the 90's also never saw the white dog in the black short.
