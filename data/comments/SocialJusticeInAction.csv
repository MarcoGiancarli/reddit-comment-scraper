I can guarantee you that she didn't know how this will impact her life after, but while she was there, doing what she had to do to make the money at that very moment she was aware, nervous, and at free will. Take the time to put yourself in her shoes, she is a young sexual girl, a young sexual girl who is in need of (or just simply wants) money won't take time to reflect before she acts. Money is her motive, she wanted it, she got it and now she started to reflect. She realized that it wasn't worth the penny, so she took it upon herself to fix the problem she got herself into. Once again not taking the time to reflect before she acts, she decided to justify her situation. Causing the opposite result of what she really wants, For this to all go away. Now, this is becoming a huge topic. Publicity for an already big website. More people will now be interested in watching her film (and all others on the website) to see if these young girls are actually being raped and/or coerced into doing porn. Only to witness for themselves that these girls are in no way shape or form raped and/or coerced into doing porn. These Still Shots capture each moment of her full film. You can see all her facial expressions through out her scene. You can see that she blushes , she has a sexual look to her , She looks like she is having fun , and she definitely enjoyed herself! . Take the time and look into the evidence. It's all right there. Now all that's left is for gdp to release her bts to reassure what I already know! Case dismissed, thanks for your time!"

People actually suffering from PTSD, who are triggered, should be treated accordingly - they should be given treatment rather than punishment, they should be given accommodations, people should take precautions not to trigger them.  SJWs see this and want the special status, despite not having legitimate PTSD or triggers - they simply reframe ""I fly off the fucking handle whenever I want"" as ""I was triggered"", and think it means they deserve the same treatment as a person with actual PTSD.  Same story with victims of rape (they want victim privilege so they call everything rape), DV (""I'm an abuse survivor because my ex slammed a door once during an argument!), trans identity (""saying I'm not plantkin is the same thing as saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman!""), oppression (""I don't feel adequately represented in video games, I'm oppressed!""), etc, etc, etc."

I'm sorry but currently there is no ground to be gained for African Americans in the Republican party, they have no influence, pollsters largely consider them a lost cause.    I don't fault them for speaking up at a Democratic Town Hall, because at least at a Democratic Town Hall there is a chance that the candidates will speak to your concerns.  How often do we see Code Pink show up at a Republican rally with zero chance of having any impact on the discussion?

They say they have no power, no voice, no influence and no ground to be gained with the GOP. But honestly their standing and influence with the GOP can only improve.

I think there was a Senate race when Bush was in office where the Democrat was pro-life and the Republican pro-choice (somewhere in the Northeast). A leading women's group (NOW?) supported the Republican, even though a Republican-lead Senate would be directly antithetical to their goals and priorities.

I mean, Hillary Clinton didn't even attend the event. Trying to get your issues addressed is fine. Doing it by way of disruptions and drowning out the speech of someone who's ostensibly on your side is another.   Look at it this way: if Sanders had acquiesced to their wishes and addressed their issues in specific and concrete ways, he would not only run the risk of alienating a big part of the moderates out there, but worse would signal to every advocacy group out there that similar tactics get attention, response and results.

He has a great deal of issues including, advocating cutting ties with friends and familiy if they do not agree with one's political philosophy; a practice he refers to as ""defoo'ing"".   His wife is a psychologist who plead guilty to professional misconduct and was sanctioned for giving professional advice over their podcast.   When questioned directly about these issues, Stefan just lies about it all.  He's particularly troublesome because he, like other movements, has a whole army of followers who will attack those who don't listen and believe. I would go so far as to argue that he is actively building a cult.    If anyone happens to enjoy him I would just say to keep his opinions in perspective."

SocialJusticeInAction,3dsfrj,UnoffendedBlog,3,Sun Jul 19 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"I served with women,  and there wasn't an issue. Of course that was when we had different requirements (which most still do,  I think),  which understands biology and gender differences. Women and men are built differently,  and should have differing physical standards.   As for whether they should have the same jobs... I can see why the Marines do what they do,  but the other branches do fine with different physical requirements. And when given the option most women don't want to be infantry. So I don't know..."
SocialJusticeInAction,3dsfrj,ggburner23,8,Sun Jul 19 02:29:23 2015 UTC,"Women should be allowed to join the military, but there shouldn't be discrepancy in physical standards for ""front lines"" jobs. If a person goes down in combat, you don't want them to be left behind because the person who ""has their back"" was admitted via lower standards and isn't strong enough to drag them to safety. If they're joining for a job that doesn't put them in that situation, then it shouldn't matter and the different standards catering to their biological differences are fine.  As a side note, my best friend and one of my coworkers are both in the military, and both are opposed to women serving in coed units, not because women are inferior or incapable, but because men ""get stupid"" around women, in their words. Men are likely to try to show off to get the women to notice them. Men are more likely to ignore orders and try to help a woman who goes down in combat compared to another man. It's definitely not fair to exclude people based on sex, but it's also not fair to gamble with human lives to prevent hurting some feelings. I don't have solid opinions one way or the other, since both sides have valid points, but it is an interesting perspective."
SocialJusticeInAction,3dsfrj,Chronoblivion,2,Sun Jul 19 08:49:58 2015 UTC,"but because men ""get stupid"" around women   I heard the same thing from Army friends that were deployed recently.

But that in places where body limits were not a problem (tanker, pilot, artillery, mechanic) they were excelling. I think the bigger issue would be ensuring that we send the most capable troops (male or female) to fight whatever adversary we meet, as they will likely do the same."
SocialJusticeInAction,3dsfrj,theaviationhistorian,2,Sun Jul 19 18:58:59 2015 UTC,I'm okay with there being a discussion about women on the front lines.

But the thing is, that’s an issue for the adult students to work out, and really, there’s no better teacher than experience.   Exactly, one thing is harrassment, but it is another the affairs of two people in the fallout of a relationship. This was either the overreach of some SJW staff, or KU being overly protective of its image. Although, the latter would be hilarious as I bet that some of their beloved sports would be using this type of language on a daily basis. As for Title IX, the only bit that might work here is:   7 . unwelcome jokes or teasing of a sexual nature or based upon gender or sex stereotypes;   As a flagship state funded university, that is an extremely broad rule. I do hope his attorneys are attacking this amateurish design of a rule. Most laws and rules are specific in order to not cause an umbrella enforcement on many things and bring undue burden to both law enforcement and civilians going about their day. Sure, there are some umbrella rules out there, but they were specifically engineered to be this way, with many legalese enforcements to make it sturdy enough to deal with any blows. This rule seemed like it was done by the student government association after taking two introductory PolSci classes.

Example:   When I pointed out that the Germans had played a major role in this situation, helping at the very least by insisting on austerity and unsustainable debt over the last three years   Austerity led to the Greeks not being able to pay back their loans? Sounds very unlikely. And I'm pretty sure that the Germans did not insist on 'unsustainable debt' - the Greeks did that on their own.   When I mentioned that many saw austerity as a new version of the 1919 Versailles Treaty that would bring in a future “chaotic and unreliable” government in Greece — the very kind that Mr. Enderlein warned about in an essay in The Guardian — they countered that they were furious about being compared to Nazis and terrorists.   I find it very unlikely that the Germans thought that the victories allies in World War I were actually Nazis. And terrorism has not even entered the equation back then. This sounds made up, and in a ham-handed way at that.   Debtors who default, they explained, would simply have to suffer, no matter how rough and even unfair the terms of the loans.    Here he simply assumes that the 'terms of the loans' were 'unfair' without any demonstration. Most of this piece is about this guy's feelz, and about how he feelz that Germany is being mean, but there is not much in the way of argumentation.

(http://psp.sagepub.com/content/38/9/1107)  You only need to browse the internet these days to see how every group sees itself as having some kind of ""social identity threat"".  There's correlational studies suggesting that people who self-report as ""colorblind"" or that ""gender doesn't matter"" may be racist or sexist, but this is just a correlation. Caring about representation may not be an intellectual belief that's created through exposure to an academic framework examining discrimination, but something that's a lot more deep-seated.  In fact, giving bigots the tools to create an intellectual framework to justify treating people differently on the basis of gender or race may backfire horribly.  It's hard to know, which is why it's very encouraging that these well-meaning reforms are being tested.  I'd post it on the article, but they require real names.

Which, they decided not to, because it would  make slaves cheaper, and they wanted to keep the prices of their own slaves high.  Oh, and also British Navy would have kicked their slaver asses.  The south has been whitewashing the confederacy for 150 years, that's why so many people believe the most absurd things about it.  It was a disgusting and vile regime that took up arms against its own people to defend slavery.  Take note, too, that they didn't wait for the supposed tyrannical North to come down on them.  Just like today's nutcases, they declared losing an election to be equivalent to tyranny.  They started a shooting war because Lincoln won the election and they didn't vote for him.  And there is a difference between destroying history and glorifying it.    These monuments are about glorifying an evil regime based on slavery and war.

Is it really so easy to believe that a nation of millions was actually willing to kill and die for slavery, despite the vast majority of them gaining no benefit from it?

Also, quite a few of the rank and file were conscripts who weren't given a choice.

As you so bluntly put it: That's not the same thing as tyranny.  The American Rebellion aka First Civil War is really a fascinating story of how much the winners get to (re)write history.  In case you don't want to take my word for it - ask an eyewitness. Here's Thomas Hutchinson, former Governor of Massachusetts, writing in 1776 in a commentary on the Declaration of Independence.   though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and as soon as it was known to have its advocates here, it was renounced by the Colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable. In every stage of the Revolt, the same disposition has always appeared. No precise, unequivocal terms of submission to the authority of Parliament in any case, have even been offered by any Assembly. A concession has only produced further demand, and I verily believe if every thing had been granted short of absolute Independence, they would not have been contented; for this was the object from the beginning."

If we held a national election, and the election was 300 million to 1 in favor of killing you for no real reason, the election would not change the fact that you were a victim of tyranny and you would have every right and reason to object to such a thing.  As the north vastly outnumbered the south, southerners often feared their interests would be steamrolled by northern ones, as is playing out today where the federal taxes paid by southerners living in zero deficit states are being used to bail out bankrupt businesses and underwater welfare states elsewhere in the country.  The primary driving factor of all forms of animosity between the north and the south boils down to the attitude northerners have towards the south.  It's never framed as a debate between equals.  It is almost exclusively framed as the enlightened, educated, intelligent Yankee telling us poor, dumb, racist, uneducated, backward hicks how things ought to be done.  People think women have a hard time being heard?  Check out just how easy it is for people to take an intellectual argument or lecture seriously when delivered with a thick, southern drawl.  Nobody even tries to hide that bigotry, as I've heard, over and over again, ""Look, if you want anybody to take you seriously, you're going to have to drop that accent.""  Well, every time some northerner butts into the south and tells us he/she knows how things ought to be done and we need to just shut up and listen, the instinct is to flip that northerner the bird and directly defy whatever it is they wanted to do.  THAT is the source of southern animosity towards the north.  Slavery just happened to be something with enough economic interests for the politicians to get in a fighting mood."

Following that logic, the new icon would be the one with the man standing much further behind. Of course, you can't really tell who's standing where because there's really no perspective, so getting upset about it one way or the other is kinda dumb.

In that case, the old icon had them almost alongside, whereas the new one has the man farther to the back. Perspective is difficult to make out in flat icons, and people are going to read into it however they want.  This is definitely trivial bullshit, but I think the reason why we're making fun of it is because the creator of the new icon felt so strongly about the trivial bullshit that she found it necessary to go through and redo a bunch of icons on (most likely) company time. Personally, I prefer the old icon not because ""hurr durr the man is leading"" but because I think that the asymmetry looks better, and also matches with the way other icons look (like the inbox/messages icon.)"

The EU has been falling apart and going nuts for years now, this is hopefully the beginning of the end when Federica Mogherini says this kind of bullshit.   Islam holds a place in our Western societies. Islam belongs in Europe. It holds a place in Europe's history,   And mostly that place is A MILLENNIUM OF WAR. Seriously, someone needs to beat Mogherini with a cluebat so she doesn't come off as utterly disconnected from the rest of the world. Because outside of the EU's ivory tower, Islam's place in Europe's history, from Tours to Vienna, is exactly what shows that Islam doesn't belong in Europe because the Europeans spent generations fighting it.   in our culture,   Out of curiosity, do you know who the Patron Saint of Spain is? It's Santiago Matamoros, which translates roughly as ""James the Kebab-Remover"". Islam's place in Spanish culture is ""the people that our culture hero killed"". Similarly in various other parts of Europe.   in our food   And this is just grasping at straws. Islamic food? Seriously? Does this absolute nitwit expect me to welcome Islam into Europe because food? Hey, Mogherini, does this argument go for slavery too?   and – what matters most – in Europe's present and future.   This is under debate and remains to be seen.   Some people are now trying to convince us that a Muslim cannot be a good European citizen   Equivocation, near-strawman. A Muslim can be a good European citizen. He just can't be a good European citizen and a good adherent of Islam. (I say near-strawman because you can always find some lone fringer who holds practically any view; but attacking the lone fringer and pretending to have met the opposition in main is the same sort of fallacious tactic as attacking an outright strawman.)   that more Muslims in Europe will be the end of Europe.   Personally, I think the end of Europe will be because asshats like Mogherini keep mistaking spineless homogenous EU bureaucratic delegates for Europe and assuming that the latter can be molded like the former.   These people are not just mistaken about Muslims: these people are mistaken about Europe, they have no clue what Europe and the European identity are   No, you. (That which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. Come to think of it, this principle lets me dismiss practically the whole speech.)   The so-called Islamic State is putting forward an unprecedented attempt to pervert Islam for justifying a wicked political and strategic project.   Wrong. It's precedented very well by Muhammed. Seriously, Mogs, learn some history. The founder of Islam was a warlord who bent religion to personal ends left, right, and centre. The Koran is littered with ""And then these people worshiped false gods, so we killed them. And then these people did heresy, so we killed them."" The core Islamic scripture supports the death penalty for fasad, variously translated ""mischief"" or ""corruption"" or ""degeneracy"", which means practically anything contrary to Islamic morals. Sounds like Islamic State to me!  WHY THE FUCK IS THIS IDIOT IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING??"
SocialJusticeInAction,3coasn,LWMR,4,Thu Jul 9 14:17:02 2015 UTC,"Great post.   Mogherini attended the Sapienza University of Rome where she studied Political Science graduating with a Diploma in Political Philosophy with a thesis entitled ""Relationship between religion and politics in Islam""   The white guilt rethoric is so ""toxic & problematic"" that we are regressing fast just to applease any request immigrants from other cultures may have.  She's one of these grown up as communists that live in a world where the west is evil and anyone else is oppressed and better than us. Yesterday I saw one guy commenting the news that Tunisian government is building a wall on the border to Lybia to protect themselves from terrorists saying something like: ""I'm shocked, they have nationalism and fight each other like us."""
SocialJusticeInAction,3coasn,LWMR,3,Thu Jul 9 15:27:07 2015 UTC,"And while I'm at it with the hatefacts and the alternate readings of history, I feel there's another particularly relevant point to bring up:  Mogherini presumably thinks Europe has been so peaceful post-WW2 because of the European Union.  I submit that Europe has been so peaceful post-WW2 because of ethnic cleansing. If you look in documents like the Potsdam Agreements, the Allies weren't even shy about stating what they were doing:   The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to be undertaken.   It's on Wikipedia:   In the months following the end of the war ""wild"" expulsions happened from May until August 1945. Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš on October 28, 1945 called for the ""final solution of the German question"" (Czech: konečné řešení německé otázky) which would have to be ""solved"" by deportation of the ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia.[3] The expulsions were executed by order of local authorities, mostly by groups of armed volunteers. However, in some cases it was initiated or pursued with the assistance of the regular army.[4] Several thousand died violently during the expulsion and more died from hunger and illness as a consequence. The expulsion according to the Potsdam Conference proceeded from 25 January 1946 until October of that year. An estimated 1.6 million ethnic Germans were deported to the American zone of what would become West Germany. An estimated 800,000 were deported to the Soviet zone (in what would become East Germany).[5]   Amazing how they can use the words ""final solution"" with a straight face when the Germans are the ones being subject to it, amirite?  Nor was it only the Germans who were cleansed. Poles were deported to Poland from all over Europe. Repeatedly. There's a disambiguation page for Repatriation of Poles and that's just the large forcible ones. Several large population transfers and exchanges were performed in the Poland-Lithuania-Ukraine-Ruthenia regions so that ethnic group distribution would match national borders.  You may also notice that the wartorn regions of Europe (Baltics herp derp Balkans, Crimea) have since then mostly been the ones where ethnic group distribution didn't match national borders. Blood ties exist. People care for kith and kin. Trying to wish such feelings away is a poor second from ensuring that one group doesn't have to live in a state run by a hostile second group, and/or where they wish they could take over.  So when Mogherini says...   ""Any attempt to divide the peoples of Europe into ""us"" and ""them"" brings us in the wrong direction. The migrants and us. The Muslims and us. The Jews and us, as anti-Semitism has not been defeated at all. The “other” and us. We learnt from our history that we all are someone else’s “other”. The fear of the other can only lead us to new conflicts.""   ...I think she's got it almost entirely backwards. It's precisely the divisions between the ""other"" and us that keep the peace. Inviting the ""other"" in is a great way to bring about new conflicts until said other is removed."
SocialJusticeInAction,3coasn,LWMR,3,Thu Jul 9 14:47:02 2015 UTC,"PS: I looked up this nitwit on Wikipedia.   A member of the Italian Communist Youth Federation from 1988, in 1996 Mogherini joined the Youth Left after the dissolution of the Italian Communist Party before its transformation into a social democratic party.   In a reasoned discussion I would be lowering the tone of the debate and committing ad hominem to suggest that Mogherini is an unregenerate Communist and should therefore be ignored on general principles, if not outright suppressed. But this isn't a reasoned debate; Mogherini's speech as linked here is basically ""Islam good, Islam european, Islam fine, needs more Islam"" with little to no supporting argument. So I think ""Fuck off, I don't take advice from commies"" is a perfectly fair rebuttal, and she has no grounds for complaining if I don't engage her speech but instead snark about how unsurprising it is that a supporter of one of the worst and most murderous ideologies in the world is sympathetic to another such."

Less cryptically, for the peanut gallery: people are often happier when they can be confident in the security and stability of their patrimony. As long as they get to live by their own rules here on this side, they don't much care what the other guy is doing on his side.

Similar to this guys view here: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/06/matt_ridley_on.html  If she's denying that the climate is changing, then I'd say that's a little bit more of an egregious error so by all means if she's said that then I think she's wrong. But it's important to be able to question about a null-hypothesis otherwise we loose the ability to do science.   EDIT: base on the information here I'd say the odds are good that she's a lukewarmer which is subtly but importantly different from a climate change denier.  EDIT EDIT: For the record I am not a lukewarmer. But the interview I linked is probably the most eloquent explanation of the position that you're going to get even if you don't agree with it and it is sans the usual GUBERMANT COMSPARACY arguments too which is nice."

SocialJusticeInAction,3cm4s4,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that's her position though. So for instance, regarding things like ""the sheer amount of agreement"" i.e. consensus (the 97% stat), that interview I linked:   Guest:Well, I'm in the 97%. That is to say if it's true that 97% of scientists are all of a particular view about climate, then let's go and ask what that view is. And if you go and look at the origin of that figure, it was that a certain poll--of 79 scientists, by the way, an extraordinarily small sample--said that, 97% of them agreed that human beings had influenced climate and that carbon dioxide was greenhouse gas. Well, I'm in that group. Pretty well every skeptic I know is in that group. I'm amazed they found 3% that disagree with that. If you see what I mean. So, actually, whenever you hear that 97% number, it's not referring to a consensus about dangerous climate change. It's referring to a consensus about humans' ability to affect the climate.  .....By the way--there was a much bigger survey of members of the American Meteorological Association, most of whom are scientists and all of whom are climatologists in some sense; and that--the figure there, when asked about 'How many of you think that climate change is likely to be dangerous?' the figure there was 52%.   Obviously, I'm kind of playing devils advocate here. But if her position resembles something like this then I'm less concerned."

These people are fundamentally not the same as conspiracy theorists and are much more dangerous if treated that way.   Conspiracy theorists almost always resort to some kind of ""you've just got to connect the dots""-thinking at some point. These people are interpreting (correctly or incorrectly) evidence. Which means that regular people, not clued in on this stuff can hear it and be convinced where they might more easily write off a ""conspiracy theorist"".  If we want to deal with these issues properly, annoying as it may be, we need to address people on the facts, not simply brand them deniers and walk away. That has the potential to be far worse."
SocialJusticeInAction,3cm4s4,MalaclypseTheYunger,-3,Thu Jul 9 12:49:50 2015 UTC,"about whether this is dangerous.    Dangerous in terms of 'this will kill the human race!' of course not. Dangerous in terms of this will destroy quite a lot of property and likely lead to increased death and cause a number of problems? Yes.    These people are fundamentally not the same as conspiracy theorists   When they repeatedly try to kafka trap their way to being right for 'reasons' they most certainly are.    If we want to deal with these issues properly, annoying as it may be, we need to address people on the facts   If only facts worked. Its like the Evolution/Creationism debate.

Assuming of course we're talking about more ""normal"" feminism equality/equity sort of stuff, which is I think what you're referring to.  The thing that really makes me say it isn't a feminist movie is that it does ultimately still place Max as the saviour for the (sort of) damsels towards the end (and perhaps that's fine: it is ""Mad Max"" after all, not ""Mad Furiosa"" or ""Mad Wives""). More importantly, it does so in a way that only really makes sense to do so if we're making a movie with the ""traditional male hero"" paradigm.  When Max chases down the women riding out over the salt he doesn't fundamentally offer them a plan that is any more hopeful than there own. Both his and their plans are last ditch attempts at survival. It's really just ""trust me I'm Max"". But more importantly, it wasn't needed.   They could have had a scene with them coming to that plan together as a group instead, even if we had Max being the spark or insight or something.   That would have: made sense within the narrative, been more equal without shoe-horning, allowed everyone agency and intelligence. But the ""I'll save the day""-bit still gets deployed.  Don't get me wrong, I fucking loved this movie. But if they were truly making a purposeful effort to make a ""feminist"" movie (I doubt this) then they missed some obvious key elements that wouldn't have disrupted content at all."

SocialJusticeInAction,3ck4vi,corruptigon2,8,Wed Jul 8 15:18:22 2015 UTC,"X-posting my comment from the same thread on /r/Japan:  I wrote them a letter (I've edited a few bits out), I thought I'd share it here. If this irritates you guys, you should send the Boston MFA a quick a note to tell them how you feel.  Here it is:  Dear Sir or Madam,  I'm writing in relation to the recent controversy surrounding the exhibition of Monet's ""La Japonaise"".  I was somewhat disappointed that the museum caved to the protesters, and was curious to know if the persons responsible for withdrawing the kimono wearing event did so out of agreement with the protester's claims of ""cultural appropriation"" or as a pacifying tactic to avoid bad PR.  I am currently a doctoral student at XXXXX, involved in a working group that spans the XXXX department and department of XXXXX, studying ""Orientalism"". My personal angle (I can't speak for my whole group) is that ""Orientalism"" is usually used as a tool to segregate races and criticize rapprochement between cultural groups. The claims of ""Orientalism"", in this instance, seemed to imply that the appreciation of Japanese material culture (in this case, the Kimono), is equivalent to an Imperialist act. Quite aside from the fact that this equivalence is transparently facile - violent imperialist acts are different to enjoying kimono, and it seems astonishing that this should have to be spelled out - the objective of these protests seems to be to segregate the appreciation of art along racial lines. In other words, the protesters seem to believe that only Japanese people should wear Kimono. Presumably - and I don't think this is a reduction ad absurdum - only Koreans should eat kimchi, Indians should practice Yoga, and so forth. The absurdity of the claims regarding the Kimono seems evident, especially in a country were ethnicity is by definition a liquid and hybrid characteristic.  This racialisation of taste, encoded in the concept of ""Orientalism"", and also in the indiscriminate use of the terms ""fetish"", has fairly horrific ramifications. Firstly, it attempts to crystallise racial stereotypes by forbidding liminal activity among cultural groups (by forbidding any transgression from one cultural group to another). Secondly, it presumes that the production and appreciation of material culture is a racial act. This assumption is insane: there is a difference between a British imperial officer looting the summer palace, and me purchasing a Game Boy. Similarly, the desire to transform an object into a symbol of race is one that should be viewed with profound suspicion. The assignation of a racial characteristic to an object is an odd enterprise, and not one that I easily see the merits of.  In conclusion, I take the view that these ""anti-Orientalism"" protesters are, in fact, racial segregationists, anti-internationalists, anti-reconciliationists, and in many ways anti-art.  Although I respect the MFA's decision to protect its public image, and I understand that you are not, at heart, a political organisation, I do feel disappointed that you did not resist the protester's demands. These protesters want to sunder the past 50 years of reconciliation between the world's races and cultures, and are doing so by attacking one of the deepest fonts of international amity - the mutual appreciation of other country's art and material cultures. Furthermore, I imagine that they could find cause to object to literally every single object on display in your museum - would you retreat from each one, as they are targeted? What if they said that the manufacture of lapis blue involved the exploitation of the peoples of the Levant, and was insensitive to the victims of British Imperialism, and so you should withdraw all works that used this colour? Where would you draw the line?  I imagine that this ship has sailed, but in any case I hope you reconsider. On a personal level, I don't want to see the brand of ethnoracial segregationism that seeks to degrade human enjoyment of each other's art and culture rise to uncontested prominence.

The 1st wave was largely about suffrage and voting rights.  The 2nd wave tackled topics like social acceptance of women in the workforce even after becoming mothers, which was in large part something the 1950's workforce saw as taboo.  But 3rd wave feminism has tossed about from one topic to another in a fad-like movement rather than fighting for equality of opportunity topics like women in combat roles or the abolishment of Selective Service for solely men.  The 2nd wave is watching as their sons are called shitlords and their daughters are told to measure their usefulness by how many men they have spit on, and it is beginning to hurt to see how far a movement they were proud of has fallen."

Carlin, quite famously, was a foulmouth -- the Supreme Court could tell you that. But his comedy was observational insights crafted in a funny way. He didn't just get up on stage and talk about pubic hair for 90 minutes like today's crop of ""edgy"" comedians. Lucille Ball proved that you could be funny with physical slapstick humor without resorting to taking off your shirt and masturbating with the microphone. Joan Rivers could do double-entendres and battle-of-the-sexes humor without being extreme.

There's another problem, which is that the market doesn't have jobs for ""ideas"" people like historians and philosophers. So what you end up having is the most intellectual fry cooks and janitors the western world has ever known. They may be quite intelligent, but they have minimal influence due to the fact that they have zilch in terms of monetary capital or access to influential social networks (not ""social network"" like the term is used for social media sites, but actual networks or groups of ""elite"" influencers, i.e. alumni networks). We don't have artists, orators or thinkers like the Greco-Roman societies did, or what used to be called philosopher-kings. Even our elite influencers are morons. Just look at Congress. One half is terrified of science and thinks the Bible is to be taken literally. The other half consists of emotional SJWs and Hollywood wannabes who don't do much else but introduce legislation about sex. But even that's to counter the religious idiocy promoted by the GOP.  Myself, I'm very much in favor of eugenics. I subscribe to /r/Childfree and even had myself sterilized. I'm no dummy (female), but mental illness runs in my family and I've had my own problems with it too, so I definitely agree with you about the stupid reproducing like rats and would extend that to the crazy doing the same. The only problem with this belief is, as you said, it gets Godwinized pretty quickly and both sides of the political aisle raise hell if you bring it up. Republicans want everyone to be Quiverfull for Jesus, while Democrats believe that opposition to welfare is racist. Either way, we all lose."

In my family's case it's mostly been a bunch of bipolar alcoholics and OCD hoarders with religious delusions.  They were/are of average to above-average intelligence, but much too unstable and in fact violent to do anything worthwhile for society or even the rest of the people who share their DNA. Nothing but Irish brawlers and Jewish neurotics who didn't even know how ""Jewish"" they were (500 years of descendants from crypto-converts in Lisbon). Basically, you mix Woody Allen with Catholic guilt and that's my mother's side of the family.

As to the actions of black Americans in Europe during WWII, I remember reading a news article not too long ago that was basically bashing French people because they were widely complaining about how black American troops were terrorizing them. The author of the article interpreted their complaints as proof of how disgustingly racist they were rather than considering the possibility that black Americans were acting like savages in France. The Japanese also had a negative experience with black Americans during WWII. They even murdered a couple of them and hid their bodies in a cave because they claimed that they were routinely raping Japanese females in the area."

But I'm not sure about some of the ideas there, so far I've seen a few broad generalizations, but I'll certainly take the time to read through more posts.   Also I did find the Open Letter To Open Minded Progressives to be intriguing. Especially this quote:  ""This is the prize at the end of our mystery. If you can find a way to stop being a progressive without becoming a conservative, you might even find a way to actually oppose the government. At the very least, you can decide that none of these politicians, movements or institutions is even remotely worthy of your support. Trust me - it's a very liberating feeling.""  That describes where I am at, I often find myself at odds with both the right wing and left wing people around me when politics comes up.

Be sure you look it up for yourself before you decide to ""Drop Some Knowledge"" by way of it.                  Depending on the translation of Mein Kampf you look at you are more likely to find that it says something along the lines of, and I am quoting more liberally to include context here:                    In this line of action the procedure of the Jew was as follows: He kowtowed to the worker, hypocritically pretended to feel pity for him and his lot, and even to be indignant at the misery and poverty which the worker had to endure. That is the way in which the Jew endeavoured to gain the confidence of the working class. He showed himself eager to study their various hardships, whether real or imaginary, and strove to awaken a yearning on the part of the workers to change the conditions under which they lived. The Jew artfully enkindled that innate yearning for social justice which is a typical Aryan characteristic. Once that yearning became alive it was transformed into hatred against those in more fortunate circumstances of life. The next stage was to give a precise philosophical aspect to the struggle for the elimination of social wrongs. And thus the Marxist doctrine was invented."

One of the main reasons I became so interested in anarcho-capitalism was because it allowed socialists to join socialist institutions, likewise with conservative, communist etc groups. My idea behind ancapistan has evolved, as I believe that there should at least be a federal-level government with at least military, high court and (minimal) taxation for all while allowing for full freedom of interactions between citizens.  This way, I can listen to the utopian systems of others, perhaps provide criticism when necessary, but not having to feel as though they must be ""defeated""."

Parents who don't grasp the concept or don't support their kids and leave them to find out for themselves twenty years later is what fucks up a lot of people. America ought to learn from this, if anything.  Though I shouldn't be surprised to see this here. Just like a lot of people on /r/KotakuInAction, unfortunately a lot of the anti-SocJus crowd is also extremely anti-trans for some stupid reason.

Even if it exists it's such a minority that I've never even seen it in my 10 months there.  Back to the point - the fact that a 7 year old believes they're a different gender than their biological sex doesn't change the fact that they're 7 years old. A 7 year old is not old enough to be making major life decisions for themselves - period. Identity politics doesn't get a special exemption just because of fee-fees and identity politics. A 7 year old may think they're a man or woman, and many 7 year olds also think they have best friend who lives in the wallpaper. Not to mention they are incredibly easily influenced.

We're not talking about SRS, we're talking about personal identification. If a kid identifies as a gender they weren't assigned at birth, why not humor them? It doesn't cause any harm, at worse some cis kids will have a valuable life experience that might give them some insight on gender, maybe they get a little embarrassed about it when they're older.

The real rule is to never apologize and never show contrition when you have done no wrong.  You may be able to battle these people and come out on top, or at least only slightly injured, but you do have to do battle to do it.  If you apologize to appease them, they will take that apology and use it to show that whatever you said or did really was awful.  Use the non-apology apology (e.g. ""I'm sorry you were offended"") if you absolutely have to; it signals ""I am not remorseful and I am apologizing under duress"".  If they offer you some sort of deal like ""step down and that will be the end of it"" (Tim Hunt) or ""donate to my patreon/charity/etc and this goes away"" (Opal), do not take it.  If you feel you absolutely must take it, do not rely on an unrecorded ""gentleman's agreement"" (the very idea of a ""gentleman"" is anathema to them, after all).  Make sure it's recorded, with witnesses, and covers any nasty thing they might do.  But it's probably better to fight it out, and resigning a position or giving in to extortion only makes your position worse.  To reiterate: they have no shame, decency, sense of fair play, or even willingness to abide by rules of combat.

But they clearly did a lot to promote women in science. Dr Taylor was wearing a sex-positive t-shirt. Sir Hunt was addressing a talk on women in science. Looking at their teams, they both hired and mentored women (probably disproportionately).  Scientists who don't care about promoting women in science don't wear loud sex-positive shirts. They don't talk about women in science. If they reject a female candidate because they think she's weak, they can easily justify it (since it's going to be on a case-by-case basis).  The people who do care about women in science paint giant targets to their chests, and don't fight back when the hate-mob comes knocking.  Every part of feminism is just as toxic. Example - http://m.thenation.com/article/178140-feminisms-toxic-twitter-wars  Here we have reports of Jessica Valenti being trashed. Katherine Cross (one of Feminist Frequency's board members?).

The Romans did not have a connotation of the prefix ""cis"" meaning good.  They did have a concept of left being unlucky or evil.  However, no similar thing happened with the prefix ""cis"".  I dare you to find a case where the prefix has taken on a clearly negative connotation.  It hasn't!  In fact, I can only find two words in Latin with ""cis"" in it..the actual preposition ""cis"", and the word ""cisalpinus"".  I searched through the entire whitaker's words database with a program I made.  That's literally it.  Neither is there a case where ""trans"" (which is, by contrast, a very common prefix) has taken on a clearly negative contrast.  Your explanation that the Romans clearly had a positive connotation for cis has literally zero evidence behind it and has a clearly ad hoc explanation which reeks of /r/badlinguistics.  The Romans were a famously self-centered bunch?  you can say the same about literally any civilization.  That says dick about the language.   In other words, every time an SJW uses cis with a sneer, almost as though it is an insult, I laugh inside because it literally means the opposite of what they seem to think it does.   I fucking hate it when third wave feminists use the term ""cishet"" too, but they didn't choose the prefix because of its supposedly negative connotation.  They chose it because it is literally the opposite of trans. You read way too much into things.  And do you know what the word ""literally"" even means?  You're talking about connotations in terms of literally, so clearly you don't."

Now the use of the words cisgender and transgender make more sense: cisgender refers to someone whose gender identity agrees with their sex, and transgender refers to someone whose gender identity disagrees with their sex. So I don't think there's a positive or negative connotation one way or the other, it just describes a logical relation.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cis%E2%80%93trans_isomerism#Diazenes  I don't know what the etymological difference is between hetero/homo and cis/trans.

SocialJusticeInAction,3b0ubo,websnwigs,0,Thu Jun 25 10:49:37 2015 UTC,"But that's a little off topic and I should give him his own thread. Let's see what's with this NYT article.   Our screens and feeds are filled with news and images of black Americans dying or being brutalized. A brief and yet still-too-long list: Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Eric Garner, Renisha McBride. The image of a white police officer straddling a black teenager on a lawn in McKinney, Tex., had barely faded before we were forced to grapple with the racially motivated shooting in Charleston, S.C.   Indeed, this is a problem. Because these are man-bites-dog stories that combine to give a false picture of a world. The screens and feeds ought to be filled with news and images of white Americans dying or being brutalized. Whites are the majority of murder victims in America. Blacks murder whites at over twice the rate that whites murder blacks. (Source: FBI homicide stats.)   I’ve had numerous conversations with friends and colleagues who are stressed out by the recent string of events; <snip monotonous paragraph.> A handful of friends recently took off for Morocco for a few months with the explicit goal of escaping the psychic weight of life in America.   What you should do then is to stop writing this article, and stop reading this sort of article. Your issue isn't life in America; that psychic weight comes from watching too much of the ""OMG OMG OMG WHITE GUY KILLS BLACK GUY! RACISM RACISM RACISM!"" media and not enough kittens. And you're contributing to it right now. (Incidentally, I wish to troll-suggest Iowa for their next vacation. It has a murder rate lower than Morocco, and is probably cheaper to get to.)   It was against this backdrop that I first encountered the research of Monnica Williams, a psychologist, professor and the director of the University of Louisville’s Center for Mental Health Disparities. Several years ago, <a relevant anecdote happened.>   Cool story bro. Moving on...   In a 2013 Psychology Today article, Williams wrote that “much research has been conducted on the social, economic and political effects of racism, but little research recognizes the psychological effects of racism on people of color.” Williams now studies the link between racism and post-traumatic stress disorder, which is known as race-based traumatic stress injury, or the emotional distress a person may feel after encountering racial harassment or hostility. Although much of Williams’s work focuses on individuals who have been directly targeted by racial discrimination or aggression, she says race-based stress reactions can be triggered by events that are experienced vicariously, or externally, through a third party — like social media or national news events. She argues that racism should be included as a cause of PTSD in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (D.S.M.).   This right here is a load of confusing waffle. Finely parsing the paragraph as written, I don't find an outright claim that reading the news causes PTSD, but Wortham seems to be deliberately dancing very close to this claim, linking PTSD to racism, racism to emotional distress, and stress reactions to watching the news. It's finely crafted bullshit that combines the gravity of PTSD, the wickedness of racism, and the reason-suppressing hysterical reaction to both. Gross intellectual dishonesty.  There also seems to be a euphemism treadmill going on, and some degree of equivocation (aka motte-and-bailey tactics). The ""racism"" that allegedly causes mental disorders is hard to reconcile with the ""racism"" of Avenue Q's Everyone's A Little Bit Racist. Wortham seems to want to combine the severity of lynching-level racism with the frequency of microagression-racism in order to whip up as much of a moral panic as possible, demanding that Something Must Be Done, while, again, contributing to the panicked atmosphere she complained about two paragraphs ago.  Various softball questions and reiterations follow, interspersed with one-sided speculation such as this:   Research shows that African-Americans, for example, are optimistic when they start therapy, but within a few sessions feel less optimistic and have high early dropout rates. It could be that clinicians don’t know how to address their problems, or they may even be saying things that are subtly racist that may drive their clients away.   Or it could be that they're overly optimistic about what the therapist can do for them. Wortham's job appears to be considering everything in the worst possible, most racist light, though, so she doesn't consider such possibilities."

And if the one-tenth was unevenly distributed by race, there would be endless articles about how Something Must Be Done!  But since aging affects everyone, we grit our teeth, deal with it as best we can, and run only the occasional article about how Maybe Something Could Be Done when expected lifespan ticks up a year and future research indicates that fiddling with telomeres could tick it up a few more before cancer gets us.

SocialJusticeInAction,3avwsu,TheEmptyKeyboard,0,Wed Jun 24 02:07:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I figured I'd take a crack at each one of these microagression examples and see where we ended up. Will analyze based on the validity of this examples, and/or the likely-hood of aggressiveness/negativity based on possible context. Hint: Context is going to be the death of a lot of these. Apologies for the long post.  Alien in One's Own Land   ""Where are you from or where were you born?""   Not racist, ethnocentric, or otherwise hostile of aggressive in any way. Simply an innocuous question regarding one's place of birth or origin, usually inspired by visual and/or behavioral cues which denote non-nativeness. Avoidance of this microaggression results in catch-22 scenario.   “You speak English very well.”   Possibly racist/ethnocentric and aggressive. Pointlessly stating obvious fact in rude or otherwise tactless manner based on ethnicity/race. Most scenarios would find this to be racist, ethnocentric, and or patronizing.   “What are you? You’re so interesting looking!”   Similar to above. Ethnocentric, racist, with tones of fetishization of Otherness, with just a hint of creepy.   A person asking an Asian American or Latino American to teach them words in their native language.   Curiosity killed the microaggressive shitlord. Demonizes attempts to engage different cultures/ethnicities through language. Extremely unlikely possibility of racism and fetishization, and only in scenarios which are excluded by examples description. ""Native Language"" implies that the person actually speaks said language.   Continuing to mispronounce the names of students after students have corrected the person time and time again. Not willing to listen closely and learn the pronunciation of a non-English based name.    Not exclusive to racially or ethnically based, as the primary act in example is ignorance and/or laziness. Intentional, negative, and possibly hostile, but said traits are not necessarily based on ethnic/racial indicators.  Ascription of Intelligence   “You are a credit to your race.”   This is not a microaggression, this is racist. Period. Mixing statements like this, clear-cut racism, in with the rest blurs racism and/or prejudicial behavior and adds ""validity"" to their umbrage: All examples presented are as racist/harmful as this one.   “Wow! How did you become so good in math?”   Possibly racist/ethnocentric and aggressive. Completely dependent on context and persons involved.   To an Asian person, “You must be good in math, can you help me with this problem?”   This would be the context missing from previous one. Racist, hostile, derogatory, and/or negative connotations, as statement is dependent on racial traits and stereotype.   To a woman of color: “I would have never guessed that you were a scientist.”   Possibly. Racial and/or ethnic prejudice dependent on situation.  Color Blindness   “When I look at you, I don’t see color.”   Actually somewhat hostile, derogatory, and/or negative. Racial blindness is a personal philosophy or ideology, and could be construed as denial of physical trait or cultural/ethnic background. You do see color, unless color blind or actually blind.   “There is only one race, the human race.”   Somewhat hostile and/or aggressive, in that it denies the existence of race. While there is some grounds for this thought, the fact that the concept of race holds such historical weight/significance, denial of it could be negative/harmful.   “America is a melting pot.”   Possibly ethnocentric, but not aggressive or hostile. The concept of cultures integrating or ""melting"" could be argued as representation of diversity in action.   “I don’t believe in race.”   Similar to ""Only one race"" example.   Denying the experiences of students by questioning the credibility /validity of their stories.   The conflation of skepticism, of requiring validity and credibility, with denial/invalidation of student experiences is one of the most dangerous developments in modern academia. Only in extreme scenarios, in which clear and reasonable evidence is denied/invalidated, is this aggressive/hostile/negative.   Criminality/Assumption of Criminal Status   A White man or woman clutches his/her purse or checks wallet as a Black or Latino person approaches.   Possibly, context may change depending. If said action is done, regardless of race, then microaggression is only manufactured by the ""victim"" internally.    A store owner following a customer of color around the store.   This is racism, contingent that the action's catalyst was the race of person. Class (e.g. poverty) most likely involved, as well.   Someone crosses to the other side of the street to avoid a person of color.   Same as purse/wallet example.   While walking through the halls of the Chemistry building, a professor approaches a post-doctoral student of color to ask if she/he is lost, making the assumption that the person is trying to break into one of the labs.   This one is a bit bizarre. The example is extremely specific, in that it assumes that a professor asking a unfamiliar student if they are lost would immediately conclude that said student is breaking into one of the labs. The racial component (e.g. microaggression) of this only exists because of the wording of example.  Denial of Individual Racism/Sexism/Heterosexism   “I’m not racist. I have several Black friends.”   Possibly racist, but context is critical. Overall, greatest fault is the stupidity and pointless nature of statement. More a fallacy of logic than a unintentional hostility.    “As a woman, I know what you go through as a racial minority.”   Similar to above. A fallacy of false equivalency, though context could change.   To a person of color: “Are you sure you were being followed in the store? I can’t believe it.”   Refer to ""Denial the experiences of students"" example. The natural skepticism of people, a logical defensive/investigative measure, is conflated with racial discrimination. Furthermore, assumes that the incredulity is a reaction to the speaker's validity, rather than coming from a desire to not believe such a racist act had occurred.  Myth of Meritocracy   “I believe the most qualified person should get the job.”   Not aggressive or hostile, nor does it invalidate possible discrimination a person might have encountered. This is a valid statement that is the logical goal of all anti-discrimination efforts (like this article) and it how it should be.    “Of course he’ll get tenure, even though he hasn’t published much—he’s Black!”   Barring the scenario in which the board specifically sought out a black professor to receive tenure because they are black, rather than a more qualified candidate, than this is racist and not a microaggression.   “Men and women have equal opportunities for achievement.”   Depending on the situation, this can be both true and false. As such, the possibility of denying historical and current discrimination is present. In general, and excluding areas where discrimination are clearly prevalent, the example is not racist, sexist, or otherwise problematic. Example conflates equal opportunity with equal results.   “Gender plays no part in who we hire.”   Refer to ""most qualified person"" example.   “America is the land of opportunity.”   Unless your a history major arguing about United States political, social, and economic propaganda and its effects on American culture/development, there really isn't much to this statement. The argument that it insults minorities because on past/current inequalities and discrimination would ignore the fact that such insults are based on poverty and economics, which are not exclusive to minorities.   “Everyone can succeed in this society, if they work hard enough.”   Refer to example above. Pulling one's self up by the bootstraps doesn't really work for most people, regardless of race.    “Affirmative action is racist.”   This is tricky. The context is needed to accurately gauge this, but the logic of this statement is not without merit. Favorable treatment based on race can be construed as a form of racism, regardless of its intent to ""right past wrongs"".  Pathologizing Cultural Values/Communication Styles   To an Asian, Latino or Native American: “Why are you so quiet? We want to know what you think. Be more verbal.” “Speak up more.”   Similar to a previous example, this is not only not racist or ethnocentric, but avoidance of this microaggression places professor/professional in catch-22 scenario. Diversity within classroom/workplace requires active participation, and more importantly, the need for diversity pressures professors/professionals to seek out such participation from racial/ethnic/gender/etc minorities. However, if the native culture of said minority runs counter to active participation (e.g. quiet, non-participating), then the professor/professional can't require or actively push minorities to share and participate without committing this microaggression, but avoidance of this microaggression results in minorities voices being ""silenced"" and accusations of racial bias towards students/workers who do engage in class or at work.   Asking a Black person: “Why do you have to be so loud/animated? Just calm down.”   Situationally dependent, but possible presence of racism.  Edit: changed some words for clarity. Hope it makes sense.  To Be Continued Below"
SocialJusticeInAction,3avwsu,TheEmptyKeyboard,3,Wed Jun 24 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"That's... a lot of text for describing normal human interaction as ""racist"".  I've been told this thing before:   “You speak English very well.”   Been asked this:   “What are you?"" (relating to nationality)   And this:   A person asking to teach them words in their native language.   And this also happened to me, since I have a hard to pronounce last name:   Continuing to mispronounce the names of students after students have corrected the person time and time again.   Sketch is relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlOoSsfU6cM  I never once in a million years would consider any of this ""racism"", then I don't live in the U.S. but in Europe and if I'd be visiting the U.S. and would be asked any of this I wouldn't consider it ""racism"" either, rather healthy curiosity.  But I generally also agree with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YJAs6Cv9I  I would on the other hand take issue with some of the other things you said in your analysis, for instance I would find this a lot more ""racist"" than most of the above e.g. reffering to a person as a ""minority"" and using clinical sounding phrases like ""of said minority"" over and over again and objectifying them as this special thing that needs to be ""engaged"" and treated differently because of ""diversity"" while using words like ""microaggression"" or ""ethnocentric"" seriously. It would easily make someone feel like a rat in a lab that needs to be prodded, studied and treated specially. I'd rather be called any number of ethnic slurs directly to my face than being treated like that on purpose every day instead of just like any other human being.   Racist or ethnocentric, but avoidance of this microaggression places professor/professional in catch-22 scenario. Diversity within classroom/workplace requires active participation, and more importantly, the need for diversity pressures professors/professionals to seek out such participation from racial/ethnic/gender/etc minorities. However, if the native culture of said minority runs counter to active participation (e.g. quiet, non-participating), then the professor/professional can't require or actively push minorities to share and participate without committing this microaggression, but avoidance of this microaggression results in minorities voices being ""silenced"" and accusations of racial bias towards students/workers who do engage in class or at work."
SocialJusticeInAction,3avwsu,TheEmptyKeyboard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I purposefully went at this subject in a more clinical, abstract manner because I felt that it better illustrated the logical failure and moral quandary of this specific example. Moreover, I was attempting to use the same logic, language, and approach that is often used to support such examples because I feel that such an approach can be very useful. I don't see what I wrote as racist at all, as I feel it is sometimes necessary to examine human interactions in an abstract manner which reduces the situation to basic objects/subjects/concepts and their interactions.  Yes, I objectified people in this example. That's what treating diversity like some quota to be filled - like many Universities and corporations see it - does to people. I'm not arguing for or against this clinical view of people/diversity, merely explaining the logic that goes into it, in relation to this example. I feel we do need diversity in the classroom, but the concept of diversity has been twisted into some weird, hypersensitive classifying agent which segregates people into neat little categories of race, sex, and gender while simultaneously dehumanizing them. Because of the complexity of people's lives, personalities and experiences, you could have a classroom filled with nothing but one race, sex, gender, class, etc. and still have a fairly diverse representation of opinions/minds.   Moreover, I didn't say to treat minorities differently, nor did I imply that I felt that such (if done) is good or bad. Again, all I'm saying is that there is more and more pressure on professors to make sure they're encouraging and receiving input/participation from minority students, to the point where it is almost becoming a requirement, and that this microaggression example would directly affect a professor's ability to fulfill this requirement. Now, I would like to clarify that I do feel that a professor/teacher should be actively engaging with students and encouraging them to participate, but this has nothing to do with race/sex and everything to do with being a good teacher. In this case, minority students do need to be engaged, not because they're a minority, but because they're a student.  As far as using the word microaggression seriously, I felt that it is better to take it seriously primarily because it can have serious consequences on universities/business/the world. It is toxic, dangerous, and wholly based on bullshit, so it is important to snuff it out as soundly as possible. As for ethnocentric, that's an argument for another time. Anyway, thanks for you thoughtful response. Cheers! Edit: Hello OP, didn't even realize it was you before replying!"

SocialJusticeInAction,3al9bz,BeardRex,2,Sun Jun 21 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"Living in NYC I see this shit all the time.   In high school I was friends with this kid who cat called every woman that passed by him on the street. I stopped being friends with this dude, and got into heated arguments with this guy because he would say some fucked up shit when girls rejected him.   He'd start screaming, insulting these women, and even threaten these women if they talked back.   You're saying you wouldn't stand for it, but the kind of people who say this aren't regular guys. Regular guys are smart enough not to act this way. People who act this way (like the dude I mentioned above) are fucking hood rats who actually might get violent with you. And actually have the potential to get violent with these women too.  I've seen it many many times, where a cat call goes bad. If a woman responds positively to these dumb hood rats it could turn into an unwanted sexual advance. If she responds negatively or ignores the dude, it could turn into a verbal assault.   So I have to agree with Henry Rollins on that point...however he completely loses me and I have no idea what the fuck he's talking about when he starts talking about date rape and short skirts. That made no sense to me."
SocialJusticeInAction,3al9bz,MidnightNick01,8,Sun Jun 21 21:04:49 2015 UTC,"The core problem with Rollins' comments is that he thinks it's part of ""male culture"" it's not. It's certainly a cultural thing, since most examples are hoodrats, guidos, or rednecks, but it's not inherently part of being male. Being the one to make the advances is a masculine trait as a whole, but people taking it to such an extreme level is not the result of that masculinity, it's a result of the culture than man was raised in or lives in.  As an example, my parents (as rednecky as they are) would kick the shit of me if I went to the extremes you describe, but they'd also tell me to stop being a chicken for not walking across the room and talking to a girl I thought was pretty. I would also get berated if I put my head down and ignored everyone as I walked. It has always been expected of me to say hi to strangers if we make eye contact. I'm not saying this is how most men are raised, but I don't think most men are raised to keep advancing on or insulting a woman who rejects them."

What he was saying is that men won't ever understand how stressful that is. And maybe we won't.   I guess we just gotta make the country less poor if we want that shit to stop haha"

I swear to god even when I look like a male hobo, keep my eyes down and do not make eye contact, I'll still get yelled at. What the hell else can a girl do? I really don't know. For example, one day I went out, looking obviously like someone who didn't want to be talked to in an outfit a uncaring teenaged boy might wear,(sweats, hoodie, no makeup, ponytail, etc)  some guy literally walked up to me and yelled accessed the street at me ""hey you wanna come suck my dick?""

SocialJusticeInAction,3ak9ep,websnwigs,3,Sun Jun 21 04:57:51 2015 UTC,"Meh. The Enlightenment is overrated. The Enlightenment is where a large amount of socjus started.  ""Everything will be fine if we just purge the evil, stupid, oppressive, hoarding, backwards, bigoted white males christians and aristocrats, and educate ourselves for liberty and justice!"" --The French Revolution  Then they turned on each other and repeatedly purged their own for being ""enemies of the revolution"". Sound familiar?  I appreciate the criticism of the turn feminism has taken, but saying ""go back to the Enlightenment"" isn't very helpful when the Enlightenment had its own share of shit. A distinction could be made here between two wings that can roughly be summarized as ""Continental"" (centered on France) and ""Anglo"" (not English, because Scotland produced a lot of its major thinkers).  The Anglo Enlightenment gave us David Hume, Adam Smith, and Edmund Burke. The Continental Enlightenment gave us Jean-Jacques Rousseau.   THE first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying This is mine, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, ""Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.""   In fairness, Rousseau was writing before the horrors of communism, so we can forgive him for being ignorant. But in retrospect he was wrong, wrong, wrong, a fact which doesn't stop his ideological relatives on Tumblr maintaining the same sort of capitalism-is-violence, communism-for-my-favored-groups, end-private-property retardation. (I could pull another hundred of this sort off TIA.)  So when Spiked says:   But our rulers, our cultural elites, our academies, cannot simply say, ‘We are against those things; we are over the Enlightenment’. And so they instinctively reach for a new set of values, a means of expressing their alienation from the ideals of modernity in a way that appears progressive rather than regressive.   they're a bit off. I think I understand which part of the Enlightenment they want, but they forget that the other half of the Enlightenment included documents like the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen which contained totalitarian gems like this:   Article III - The principle of any sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation. No body, no individual can exert authority which does not emanate expressly from it.   And 200-year-old suppression of ""hate speech"" and a heckler's veto:   Article X - No one may be disturbed for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law."
SocialJusticeInAction,3aht8l,autisticbean,37,Sat Jun 20 08:39:34 2015 UTC,This is an essay I wrote about some of my run ins with SJWs in the autism community. I am the father of an autistic boy. For the most part joe public has been nothing but sympathetic and they try to understand. There is still much ignorance about autism and autistic people do get a lot of shit from society. But the only only time I have ever experienced hate is when engaging with SJWs. Which is ironic because they purport to be fighting for kids like my son. Of course the reality is that they are reAlly just fighting to promote their own feelings of moral superiority.
SocialJusticeInAction,3aht8l,theaviationhistorian,3,Sat Jun 20 08:43:18 2015 UTC,"There is a lot I agree on with this essay. I have high functioning autism and this shit is what I stumble onto whenever I try to find or create representative movements regarding my diagnosis.  I hate SJWs due to their dishonest actions and being absolute strangers to the actual plight of many, but take on these actions nonetheless. They also do great damage to these movements in order to fulfill their narcissistic desires.   ""You need to shut the fuck up and listen to us autistic people""   I don't know what is worse, this or Autism Speaks (and its many Jenny McCarthys) that follow along the same lines whilst acting like all Autistic diagnosed folk are diseased and should be cured; while blaming it all on vaccines.  So many organizations exist that actually support those with Autism, but there are too many SJWs within this diagnosis to give proper support. But I agree with you that it is slowly getting better as the SJWs and other idiots are weeded out by putting their BS into the limelight and there will be proper support in a way that the LGBT community is embraced in modern culture."

However, one of your headlines uses ""its"" instead of ""it's"" and misses a couple of em dashes. Also, ""Autistic"" isn't a noun, it's an adjective. You don't have to go full SJW and say ""person of Autism"" or some such nonsense, but ""Autistic person"" is a better name, just like you wouldn't (or at least shouldn't) refer to ""the gays,"" ""the blacks,"" etc..   I also disagree that Autistic people don't have equal rights. We do, we just have very different needs that society isn't really prepared to fill yet. Also, Autism is a medical condition. Curing it would be great for people who are low-functioning and preventing it would be a net benefit.   Overall, I agree with your message aside from those few quibbles. Thanks for sharing!"

Thanks for the corrections.   As for the rights issue. Yes indeed autistic people do have the same rights as all humans but accessing those rights is harder. The right to an education is a good example. My sons educational needs are not met by the current system. So he has the right to an education as laid down by the European Human Rights act but accessing that right is very hard because the current system does not cater for him. Ironically if he had greater learning difficulties and cognitive impairments then this right would be better met as the current system in the UK meets the educational needs of those kids better. But for kids like my son who are bright but still unable to access mainstream education due to the way they are his full potential is unlikely to be met by the current system."

It is run by parents and mainly caters to the needs of parents. They preach a message of curing and preventing autism. This is not a good message as it perpetuates the lie that autism is some kind of medical condition. But for all their faults Autism Speaks will treat parents with compassion and kindness. They have the wrong message but they deliver it in a way that is attractive and welcoming.""  Is autism NOT something we want to prevent/cure? If it's not a medical condition of some sort then what is it? I can't imagine anyone thinking it's a normal state or a desirable condition."
SocialJusticeInAction,3aht8l,TacticusThrowaway,5,Sat Jun 20 19:28:32 2015 UTC,"Well it's complex. For most autistic people I would say yes it is indeed a natural state that should not be cured or prevented. It is much like homosexuality in that it is a typical for sure but not something undesirable or less than. However autism is a very varied condition with probably many underlying causal brain states. Some manifestations cause very severe disability and hence could , quite rightly be considered undesirable.   But for my son and most autistic people they will be just fine if we can make some sensible changes to the way we educate and with a bit of acceptance of his atypical way if being.  I understand why people think autism is bad. This is what we are are all taught by the media. This is what I myself thought a few years ago. But trust me the autism you see on TV is not what autism is actually like.tv autism is ""freakshow TV"" exaggerated in its awfulness to make the TV more compelling. Real autism is, for the most part, somewhat less dramatic."

Lies and slander.  I want to make it very clear that this covenant is bullshit right off the bat. I don't know whether it's ignorance or dishonesty - the writer might be truly startled because he's ignorant, or feigning shock to appeal to emotion - but it should be thrown out anyway. Tech has lots and lots of asians and males because those are the populations with the highest concentrations of tech-relevant traits. It has fewer whites, fewer females, fewer blacks, etc. because those populations have lower concentrations of those traits, which are distributed across multiple dimensions with multiple patterns of variation. So I'm not startled at all by the ""lack of diversity"".  Not that I even need to argue unequal distributions, because, as you may have done a double-take at: Yes, I said fewer whites. In America, whites (i.e. euro-americans) are a smaller fraction of tech workers than they are of the population as a whole. It's asians asians asians across the board. Deal with that, SJWs, and I'll consider the possibility that you're being honest on the race component of ""diversity"" after I hear you admit that diversity demands more people of pallor.  Regarding the sex component, men have higher variance on practically everything than women, and are therefore most numerous at the ends of everything. Most likely to strike it rich: men. Most likely to wind up poor and homeless: men. Most likely to go tightrope-walking across Niagara Falls: men. Fastest people in the world, across all distances: men. Fattest people in the world, by weight or by BMI: men. Doing good tech work in open source projects requires a autist-oid mindset fairly far removed from the norm, something most commonly found among, you guessed it, men.

The core idea of the book is the so-called Power Dead-Even Rule, the theory that for two women to forge a positive relationship, their self-esteem and power must be kept ""dead even."" When one woman gets more power--through a promotion, for example--it sets off tensions...    The book looks at a number of things, including the social behavior of chimps and how, in many ways, it is similar to human social behavior. It's way too much to describe here, but the idea is that, in order to ensure genetic survival, the social relationships of men have developed to be hierarchical(or vertical, if you prefer,) while the relationships of women have developed to be horizontal, because these relationships will be most useful in the survival and rearing of her children.  This type of thinking may be hard wired into the brains of many women, and while it's certainly effective in regards to children, it is no way to run a society.

Both my parents were fairly outspoken liberals, and since I was little, the idea that all people deserve equal treatment has been the most important political ideology to me. When anti-SJW stuff started gaining steam, I wrote them off as bitter sexists/racists or whatever, and maybe some of them were. But what I've realized in the past few months, as my university repeats to me constantly that I'm a rapist, as people online telp me that my opinion is invalid because of my genes, is that the social justice crowd is not fighting for equality, or civil rights, or understanding, or anything I've always thought of as ""social justice"". They're just fighting for thought policing.  When it was revealed that Brendan Eich, the CEO of Mozilla and the inventor of JavaScript, had donated a few thousand dollars to an anti-gay-marriage campaign, there was an uproar from SJWs demanding for him to be fired. A few days later, Eich stepped down as CEO, knowing that he had become too much of a pariah to lead the company effectively. (Sure, to most liberals, the guy seems like a dick for caring if gay people can get married.)  Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, who has spent decades of his life creating a free, open source operating system that anyone is allowed to contribute to and use, tends to use swear words and berate contributors who try to commit poor-quality code. These rants are never sexist, racist, or in any way bigoted. Nevertheless, the SJW crowd has repeatedly targeted Linus, asking (you guessed it) for him to be removed as Linux's lead developer. Here, they're not even trying to police a thought; they're trying to police being not-nice.

Now as for the proposed code itself, which isn't very good either:   As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.   I am a little suspicious about the ""other activities"" being a possible loophole. Yes, it has a reasonable interpretation of intent, but if that were enough, why write a code in the first place? Still, this is a trivial nitpick.   We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of [various attributes].   SJWs feel harassed by the mere presence on the project of dissenters from the socjus agenda. You see it with the recent Opal spat. Coraline wanted a person removed from a github project because that person had been insufficiently respectful on Twitter, and then more SJWs showed up saying things like this: ""As a queer person this sort of argument from a maintainer makes me feel unwelcome. The ignorance which @elia shows by claiming that transfolk are ""not accepting reality"" is actively harmful."" With blinding speed we start at disagreement, whiz past harassment and wind up in the fantasyland of active harm.  Retaining this element in the code of conduct would be a very, very bad idea because it gives everyone a free veto to have anyone else thrown out by saying ""that person makes me feel unwelcome"". (Unless you victim blame and throw out the participants being harassed, but that gives you an even worse problem when it comes to actual harassment.)   Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.  sexual language or imagery   Puritanism!   derogatory comments   Fragile feelings!   personal attacks   You mean like calling @elia ignorant?   trolling   First half-decent point here.   public or private harassment   Would be a good point if ""harassment"" hadn't been twisted by the SJWs to mean ""disagreement""   insults   You mean like saying ""you fucking muppet""?   or other unprofessional conduct   Eh, I guess you gotta have a catch-all to stop ruleslawyers.   Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.   This paragraph is self-referential to the wider code, and therefore about as good as the wider code (which isn't looking very good so far).   This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.   As long as one is strict about ""representing"", sure. This shouldn't be a rule that people have to shut up everywhere they mention their connection to the project. It should apply narrowly to events like giving a presentation about the project at a tech conference.   Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.   Boilerplate."

We certainly don’t have testimony from a mental health professional responsible for his care that he suffered from any specific mental illness, or that he suffered from a mental illness at all.   But we do know enough for you to blame it on him being a white dude?"

White privilege is what caused you to live in a country with running water and cheap, reliable electricity. White privilege is the reason you have access to electricity at all, for that matter. Franklin, Volta, Faraday, Tesla, Edison, Watt, Ampere, Ohm, Ørsted, Seebeck, Maxwell, Hertz, just to name a dozen major figures in the process from discovery to commercialization of electricity - privileged white males, all of them, doing privilege things like sitting around in their privilege labs playing with privilege toys and fiddly bits of wire and magnets and kites, when they could have been out doing LGBTQQIJKLMNPoC activism instead of privileged weird nerd shit of no use to anyone.  Until it became of absolutely massive use to everyone.

SocialJusticeInAction,3abue4,IAmSnort,11,Fri Jun 19 01:34:03 2015 UTC,"""Meredith Patterson’s valiant effort is probably doomed"" by ESR seems relevant here, ESR being one of the Ancient Wizards of hackerdom.   The problem is, maradydd’s attempt requires the feminists and social-justice warriors she is addressing to fundamentally be about justice and inclusion, enough so that it is possible to change their behavior by appealing to those values. But that’s not what I see what I look at those people. What I see is thin rationalizations over bullying, dominance games, and an endless scream of monkey rage.  But even before this Shanley Kane didn’t puzzle me at all. Whenever I see screaming, hate-filled behavior like hers the important part never turns out to be whatever principles the screamer claims to be advocating. Those are just window-dressing for the bullying, the dominance games, and the rage.  You cannot ameliorate the behavior of people like that by accepting their premises and arguing within them; they’ll just pocket your concessions and attack again, seeking increasingly abject submission. In one-on-one relationships this is called “emotional abuse”, and like abusers they are all about control of you while claiming to be about anything but.  Third-wave feminism, “social justice” and “anti-racism” are rotten with this. Some of the principles, considered in isolation, would be noble; but they don’t stay noble in the minds of a rage mob.  I think it is doomed to try fending the SJWs off using their own jargon. We have a better place to stand. Here it is: Shut up and show us the code.  You want to make a point about women or minorities in hacker culture? OK, where is your commit history? What open source have you hacked on? Where are your Arduino and Thingiverse designs? Are you running any development projects yourself? What do you bring us that isn’t monkey screaming? Why should we care what you think?  And if the answer is “Justice!”, then our reply has to be this: The code is its own justice. No compiler or network stack or 3-D printer gives a crap about the shape of your genitals or the color of your skin, and hackers as a culture don’t either.  If you want to make the hacker culture and the civilization it serves a better place, welcome. There’s plenty of work to go around. But leave your jargon and your guilt-tripping and your bullying and your special pleading and your monkey rage at the door, because about those we determinedly refuse to give a shit."

Domestic violence is recognized as a major cause of homelessness for women and is reportedly the fourth most common reason given for an application for housing in Scotland. Changes to housing support in the United Kingdom, and the withdrawal of the Spare Room Subsidy, also known as the “bedroom tax”, are reportedly reducing women’s ability to find rental properties owing to the unavailability of suitably sized accommodation (see A/HRC/25/54/Add.2, para. 46).

I'd imagine it's certainly got to be more expensive though.   If I were national policy maker I'd probably oppose putting people on housing support into houses that are too big to suit their needs, but if those are the only homes available I don't necessarily think that should preclude someone from being able to live somewhere with government assistance.   I don't think it's a crazy thing for a feminist to try to influence, at any rate. I mean, she's a feminist, she's specifically trying to benefit women. If reinstating the spare room subsidy actually does statistically benefit women it makes sense that she'd target it. It's right in line with her expected motivations.  When budget cuts come around, we try to defend the things we care about. I'd be happy to vote for someone who'd get more funding for NASA, for example, because I think we ought do do more in space.

If it makes 'em happy leave 'em be.   This, IMO, is the bait in bait and switch. It's a nice sentiment, but I don't believe any such principle is actually on offer. If an actual honest leave 'em be policy were proposed or applied across the board, I'd be interested. But instead there's a switch to a demand that everyone in the vicinity play along or there will be consequences. ""Who cares if someone wants to call Bruce Jenner a man? If it makes 'em happy leave 'em be."" -- that's not happening.  Rather, there's the sort of thing noted at the bottom of OP's link:   As you may know, serial litigant and Anti-Free Speech activist Gary Burns is using legal terrorism to shut down this website. He’s lodged a huge volume of complaints with the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board. In each case, I could be fined up to $100,000 and forced to apologise for my beliefs. If I don’t, I could be jailed for contempt.   See also: Donglegate. Man makes dongle joke. SJW woman gets offended. SJW woman gets man fired for saying ""forking"" where she could overhear it, issues incredibly self-righteous proclamation about how she is a modern-day Joan of Arc saving a space for women in tech.  The SJW ""acceptance"" movements have gone far beyond demanding acceptance and into the politics of personal destruction against random people who won't put the modern-day equivalent of ""Workers of the world, unite!"" in their window. Unsurprisingly, there's backlash from people who think it's bullshit and don't appreciate demands for them to play along with bullshit. On top of that, the backlash has been massively aggravated by SJWs posting #killallmen and #diecisscum and people like Bahar Mustafa ramping it up to banning whites and men from a student union event and doubling down on ""Kill all white men"" when called on it. This is emphatically not leaving be."

SocialJusticeInAction,3a0ov4,LWMR,6,Tue Jun 16 08:49:36 2015 UTC,"One more for the hundreds-long Bullied and Badgered, Pressured and Purged list.  It's really depressing. And possibly worse than the events themselves is the ominous portent: if this is what they can do with an angry internet mob, what would the social justicars do given any more power?  I wish to reiterate just how grossly hypocritical, spineless, and generally lacking in integrity much of the progressive Left is in such matters, too, when they cry to high heaven over ""McCarthyism"", then proceed to cheer for worse.  To recap what sort of thing actually happened back then: The Hollywood Ten were a bunch of Communists summoned by the HUA Committee  to appear before Congress and answer questions relating to their Communism and support for a hostile foreign power with a massively murderous ideology. They responded by appealing to the First Amendment as justification for saying 'fuck your committee!' and refusing to answer questions. So they got $1000 fines and 3-12 month prison sentences for contempt of Congress. Terribly oppressive, wasn't it? /s  The President of the MPAA then issued the Waldorf Statement which started the Hollywood Blacklist. Slightly abbreviated, it goes:   We don't want to hire these Communists now. But we'll happily hire them again if or when they're cleared of contempt of Congress and have sworn that they're not Communists any more.  We don't want to hire any Communists. Generally, we don't want to hire anyone advocating violent rebellion and the overthrow of the United States Government.  We realize that this policy runs the risk of inciting fear and hurting innocent people. We will do our best to try to avoid and mitigate this, because those things are very bad for artistic freedom.   Whereas here the process seems to have skipped every caveat about how this might have negative side effects, skipped the bit where Hunt is asked questions, skipped the bit where he's given an opportunity to redeem himself, and gone straight from ""This person said communist sexist things"" to ""Let's blacklist this person for ever"" on the basis of less evidence."

The definition has drifted somewhat, but I'd guess it's still mostly the same sort of thing.  If you are charitable, you can interpret this as meaning the fields of study that we build a civilization in order to be able to afford - the things we work in order to be able to do.

Is it just because they're our peers so we just naturally take them more seriously? Is it because we've matured and maybe think they have a point?

We don't understand ANY OF IT but pretend we do to feel good about things. And now we've accept sexual reassignment surgery, while conveniently ignoring the fact that nothing is getting reassigned, just remodeled.   There are not 6 genders. There are 2 genders and a ton of variation that adds up to everyone, even intersexed (they have parts of 2 genders, the only 2 there are, which doesn't = a 3rd but a sad defect in the dna)  The stuff about ""transabled"" is something I just stumbled upon somewhere on reddit a couple days ago, and I'm not even going there.

I don't believe in Otherkin or trigender pyrofoxes. I don't believe in all that special snowflake bullshit, and I don't believe in transgender people who just label themselves as transgender and no other gender.

Probably not, and I don't really agree with that either (I think they should at least wait until their teen years to make that big, life-changing decision) but I would never talk about this in such a disrespectful, shitty way.

It is related to xenomelia, ""the oppressive feeling that one or more limbs of one's body do not belong to one's self"".   BIID is typically accompanied by the desire to amputate one or more healthy limbs to achieve that end. BIID can be associated with apotemnophilia, sexual arousal based on the image of one's self as an amputee. The cause of BIID is unknown. One theory states that the cause of BIID is a neurological failing of the brain's inner body mapping function (located in the right parietal lobe). According to this theory, the brain mapping does not incorporate the affected limb in its understanding of the body's physical form.

SocialJusticeInAction,39rl43,Paganator,56,Sun Jun 14 12:51:42 2015 UTC,"Also note that one comment was my only participation there.  I considered myself a feminist up until GamerGate. After seeing all the anti-gaming social justice warriors claiming to be championing feminism, I dropped the label. I thought I'd give it a chance again, because I do truly believe in the principles of what feminism used to be. However, nowadays it seems like the majority (and not a minority as I had believed) of feminist activists are man-hating, censorship-loving authoritarians.  My girlfriend still calls herself a feminist and convinced me that these are vocal minorities. I'm seriously having trouble believing that after  all of my interactions with feminists end in being blocked or banned, and while I'm not even being antagonistic. I'm simply dissenting, and that is apparently a sin."
SocialJusticeInAction,39rl43,1337Gandalf,27,Sun Jun 14 02:02:15 2015 UTC,"I think feminism has been hijacked by extremists. While feminists achieved great and important things in the past, the remaining issues are too subtle and hard to solve to get the average person very vocal. There are a lot of moderate feminists out there -- like your girlfriend, presumably -- but they don't voice their opinion very loudly.  For example, many high paying jobs (in computer science and engineering for example) are predominantly occupied by men. A lot of people would like to see more women in these jobs, but few seem to be interested to work in these fields even though there are several programs and incentives aimed at that problem. Some see this situation as a problem, but there is no easy solution, so it's hard to get worked up about it.  The feminists who do raise their voices are the extremists; the man-hating, censorship-loving authoritarians you talk about. What's more, there's a lot of young women out there who want to fight -- no, they must fight -- for womens' rights. That girl's mother was a feminist, so was her grandmother, and she has heard from a very young age that she must fight to improve the fate of all women.  She's primed to fight for a cause, but there isn't much left to fight for. When she finds a community or people like her online led by an extremist, she has discovered a cause to fight for. The echo chamber of these communities amplifies the message and quells any doubt she may have that maybe ""mansplaining"" and ""manspreading"" are not really great ills of our society. And so another extremist is born.  There's also the problem of narcissism. Tumblr is a great platform for narcissists: they can publish anything they want to a worldwide community with very little effort, so the platform attracts them like flies and makes it seem like their narcissism is normal. One characteristic of narcissists is that they never think they're at fault. If something goes wrong in their life, it must be because of outside forces and not their awesome self.  Feminism provided a great scapegoat for the narcissists' problems: the patriarchy. You don't have to take responsibility for your problems if you can blame them all on a massive conspiracy of men trying to keep women down. So Tumblr narcissists started a weird brand of feminism that prefers to blame men for everything rather than actually solve issues. (To be clear, I'm not saying that all feminists are narcissists, only that some narcissists were attracted to feminism for the wrong reasons.)"
SocialJusticeInAction,39rl43,flyingpilgrim,16,Sun Jun 14 03:28:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but the hijacking took place a lot farther back in history than you probably think.

Self-criticism, however, did not guarantee political rehabilitation, and often offenders were still expelled from the Party, or in some cases even executed.  In the Soviet Union, Criticism and Self-criticism was known as kritika i samokritika.

I'm assuming no one in this sub would go there but regardless:  I think it's pretty easy to draw a line under this stuff that isn't completely arbitrary. You can quite easily manipulate biology (specifically brain biology) both by natural chance or by deliberate effort to make you more or less ""female"" or ""male"". It should be evident how you might shape cultural identity too. But there is experience and biology at play here.  Though perhaps you could train someone to think they are a dog (feral children being a good case study), what you could never do to a human is induce, purely by biological means (save for yanking out the brain altogether and replacing it) induce a state of ""dog"". And so I don't see it as necessary to even begin making that distinction."

SocialJusticeInAction,39o17e,Rudd-X,9,Sat Jun 13 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"This boils down to the discussion on ""Cultural Marxism"" again.  See this for a historical explanation of the term: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sc1pi4  These are some interesting articles on the topic:  http://www.everyjoe.com/2014/12/11/politics/defining-cultural-marxism/  http://www.everyjoe.com/2014/12/16/politics/cultural-capitalism-little-in-common-marxism/  There were various Marxist movements that merged with other ideological undercurrents when it became inconvenient due to political realities of the times, for example major brands of Feminism through the 80s, these were two people that were part of Feminist movements back in the day and lived it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIpShuFUM0s (you should definitely watch this for a better understanding of what Marxism has to do with Feminism) and as a result there were cracks and conflict within several communist parties like the one of Great Britain and the Netherlands, which ended up dissolving since many wanted to concentrate on class issues: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_Netherlands#1967.E2.80.931989   The CPN tried to renew its political program, emphasizing New Left issues like feminism and gay rights. In reaction to this working class-oriented members founded the Horizontal Council of Communists (called so because they were members from different local branches, breaking the vertical organization of democratic centralism). The group tried to pressure the CPN into returning to its Old Left course.   A more recent example of a political party being hijacked by the same kind of people is the Pirate Party in Europe, that was liberal/libertarian (e.g. Internet freedom, copyright reform, increase of personal freedoms/rights, demands for better consumer protection and privacy laws) but lost out to progressives and feminists that pushed gender politics and similar into it and other people like the original founders out.  As for how far I understand it's contemporary use, basically is:  Marxism = Class struggle  Cultural Marxism = Oppression Olympics based on ethnic heritage, sexuality and ""gender""  You can for instance see it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCwhlZtHhWs  A self-identified ""cultural Marxist"" even initiated the deletion of the page explaining ""Cultural Marxism"" that had existed since 2006 on Wikipedia, because apparently it doesn't exist and is a ""conspiracy theory"": https://archive.today/0L5wt#selection-3597.0-3597.52  Basically a lot of classic Marxists have a problem with rich Middle class Critical theorists taking the concept of class struggle and trying to turn it into a gender/race/sexuality war, ignoring class almost entirely: http://i.imgur.com/64gjf4Tl.png"

This much is uncontroversial, Friedan WAS a communist who was smart enough to not start saying stuff until after McCarthyism burned out.    But what happened is that the communist goal to demolish the strong family, mixed with two distinctly American issues.  Sexual puritanism vs sex positivity, and the legacy of chattel slavery.    These issues collided on campuses in the 70's and mutated, and the resulting movement was something its original progenitors could no longer control.  Social justice is a monster that feasts on the experiencing of self righteous indignation, elevating it to the point of being a religious experience.  Reagan was able to keep it in check (remember, John Denver sided with Dee Snider against Tipper Gore), but by the end of Clinton it was entrenched in the form of political correctness."

SocialJusticeInAction,39cxeu,TheSabi,3,Thu Jun 11 05:01:46 2015 UTC,"Look at the petty tyrant!   We need to talk about the role that provocative comedy holds today in a progressive world.  Sexist humor and racist humor can no longer exist in comedy because these concepts are based on archaic ideals  Provocative humor, such as ones dealing with topics of race and gender politics, can be crass and vulgar, but underlying it must be a context that spurs social dialogue    Hi, college student. I'd like to talk to you (well, more like ""respond at you"") about the concept of intellectual hegemony. This is sort of like the matter of fish and water. We'll start by imagining that we have a time machine and can travel 500 years back to 1515 Spain, or rather, Castile, at the time. There we shall have a talk with Cisneros, head of the Spanish Inquisition. You have this notion of a ""progressive world"". Cisneros has one of a ""Christian world"". I think it might be useful to compare some of the similarities and differences the two of you have as a means of elucidating your unspoken assumptions, and clarifying what exactly this ""progressive world"" is.  How wide is the reach of ""world""? Presumably you don't mean that Iran is progressive enough to be worth mentioning, what with its official policy of having no homosexuals. Nor Australia, which is sinking most of the refugee boats heading there, and throwing the survivors in prison until they can be deported. And somehow, considering the rest of your attitude on display, I don't think you'd call Texas progressive either. Or even in your own state, that crazy uncle you probably have, who says racist things every Thanksgiving.  Which suggests that ""progressive world"" doesn't mean that the world right now is progressive, but rather that you have a vision of progressivising the world in much the same way Cisneros has one of Christianizing it. When Cisneros spots a heretic, his instinct is to have the heretic thrown out on the King's orders. When you spot a heretic -- err, let me rephrase that for ideology in place of religion. When you spot an archaic, or whatever, your instinct is to see if you can get the archaic thrown out  via harassment statute, where ""harassment"" is whatever makes orthodox progressives feel uncomfortable. Cisneros will offer the heretic an opportunity to recant. You'll offer the archaic a chance to be ""socially responsible"". Cisneros puts on morality plays and mystery plays about how horrible Hell is. You put on Amy Schumer sketches about how horrible football teams are.  You might object that you're nothing like an Inquisitor. Well, sure, you're richer, so you can afford to pay for more indirect forms of evangelism and call it morality. But Cisneros assures me that if he had your tools like the newspaper, he'd happily drop a lot of the messier parts of the Inquisition and instead plaster ""This person is a heretic and needs to recant"" across national media so everyone could recognize and shun the heretics. Social pressure on a national scale works wonders in a way that personal threats can't. If you'd ever read the story of the widow's mite, you'd know that being rich is no credit to your morality.  And you're safer; for all your blab about ""horrifying truth of rape culture"", you weren't born at the tail end of the better part of a millennium of bitter warfare between what one might roughly describe as Spain and the Umayyad Caliphate (with successor and predecessor states thereto). It wasn't until Cisneros turned 46 that the war with the Emirate of Granada began that would eventually remove the last Muslim state from Iberia ten years later. The last American-Mexican war wasn't in living memory of anyone in 2015, let alone your life.  You're also more dishonest. If I ask Cisneros about Christian orthodoxy, I can count on getting a straight answer and it'll be the same one ten years from now. If there's something he doesn't know, he can undoubtedly refer me to someone who does. Now let me ask you. What's your orthodoxy? What are the demands of the ""progressive world""? Is there any sort of person or text of authority one might consult with to determine these? What will they be like in ten years? Who could persuade you to change your beliefs about this ten years from now?"

SocialJusticeInAction,39by71,redditthrowawaykin,6,Wed Jun 10 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"As an autistic woman with chronic depression these words are harmful to me.   30 Tips for the Easily Offended Aspie http://www.adultaspergerschat.com/2013/09/tips-for-easily-offended-aspie.html   Allow most of life to be indifferent to you. Someone’s bad mood isn’t about you – it’s about him or her! This way, less in life will offend you, and happiness will be much less fleeting. Consider the context that things are being said or done. Sometimes, you may have misunderstood and taken it wrongly. Don’t be emotionally attached to your opinions and viewpoints. Don’t hold on to the words others use to get at the thing they are trying to express. Hear the idea and ignore the clumsiness of the expression. If everything is reduced to how it negatively affects you, no wonder you are so frequently offended! If you expect others to act and speak a certain way, if you assume others will be as kind or compassionate as you, if you’re offended when they don’t rise to the level of your expectation, you will almost always be offended or on the verge of it. In the heat of the moment, try asking yourself, “Why am I getting so upset? Does this issue really matter that much?” Reason with yourself: “Did that person really mean it the way I was just about to take it? Is that person actually trying to hurt me? If not, what is this person really trying to say?” Keep in mind that when a comment seems offensive, it may not be aimed specifically at you. It may be a casual comment, but the other person is unaware that you are taking it personally. Accept yourself deep inside. Validate your inner being. See yourself as more than your behavior. You are also your potential. Learn from your past experiences, and be careful the next time you speak or do something. It may save an individual who is overly sensitive a lot of grief. Many “Aspies” are easily offended because they can’t emotionally differentiate between their thoughts and their inner sense of self. When identities are too closely tied to one’s opinions, and those opinions are then disagreed with, many feel like they have been rejected – pushed to the pavement and crushed. This, of course, is highly inaccurate. One “Aspie” stated that whenever he hears that he has offended someone, his first response is to stop and think if, in fact, he may have said or done something that could have given the impression of an offense. That, by itself, is a great attitude of humility that would make him almost immune to offense. But he didn’t stop there. He went on to say that he often found that he had indeed said something that could have been construed as offensive. He would then seek out the offended party and apologize for the misconstrued word or deed. Part of accepting others’ imperfections is learning to forgive them for their past mistakes and create a sort of “forgiveness-default-setting” in your heart that you automatically go to when confronted with offensive language or behavior. People who are internally fragile – no matter how “tough” their exterior – break most easily at the wrong or misplaced word or deed. So grow your inner self. Become self-accepting, and life will be a more consistently joyful place to live. Pray for the ability to forgive and forget the offense if you have been truly offended. Putting yourself in the offender’s shoes will have the added benefit of being less offensive to others, as you learn to be “too noble to give offense.” If you can empathize for a minute, you can learn to see things from the offender’s perspective. And then you will see that you too played a role in the conflict. Also, you might come to see that the offender had no such intentions of offending. Realize that your opinions are not you. Any given opinion is not the whole of who you are. To the degree you can detach your ideas from your identity, you will live a fulfilling life with little opportunity to feel offended. Remember, humans are imperfect. You are imperfect. Life is imperfect. And that’s just the way it is. When you can accept others’ imperfection – and your own – you will be well on your way to a life of more emotional stability and joy. The reason you usually feel offended is because of the meaning you attach to what is said or done (e.g., “That means she really doesn’t care!” …or “He’s saying I am no good!” …or “I knew she didn’t really love me!” …and so on.). And so the internal interpretation goes. So often we jump to conclusions, assume an ill intent, create meaning to a word that then hurts and offends. Resist that urge and delay judgment until the conversation has run its course. You just may find there is no offense to be had by the time you get to the end. Self-acceptance will literally destroy others’ ability to offend you. It won’t hurt because your validation doesn’t come from their opinions about you. Stay away from self-pity when offended. It can destroy your self-esteem and make you miserable. Talk to the “offending” party about how you feel. That individual may not even realize that he or she has offended you. Calmly talking over the issues can help to resolve misunderstandings, hidden anger and frustration. Talk yourself out of the offense by telling yourself, “This person is simply expressing an opinion, and listen to how interesting it is! I find it so fascinating that someone can have such an opinion that is almost the exact opposite of mine!” Tell yourself that maybe the “offending” party is having a bad day and does not realize how she came across. Don't judge, and avoid jumping to conclusions. Tell yourself that the individual who is the potential offender has as much right to her opinion as you do to yours. Besides, they’re only words. The “everyone is out to get me” mentality is fertile soil for being frequently offended. Every word out of every mouth, every action or inaction, all that is done or undone, all motives and intentions become a stab at you. That is a HUGE burden to carry. Think positive and stop brooding over the offense. Thinking too much often makes you jump to conclusions that are not based on fact. Unless proven otherwise, assume the “offending” party has noble intent. Maybe the language was clumsy, maybe even ill-advised, but assume a good heart. That should take the sting out of the bite and put some joy back in your moment. We all have faults, quirks and character flaws. So do you! Yours just may be different than theirs. So, shrug and let it slide off your back. Don’t hold on to the imperfections of others so tightly that you strangle yourself in the process!"

It is very hard to debate with someone whose entire position boils down to ""I hurt! Stop doing things that hurt me!"" No counterargument is possible, because no argument is presented. Dismissing it as absurd is unconvincing; dismissing the hurt as acceptable comes off as callous. Autistic-woman-with-chronic-depression (hereafter Awwcd) is jerking people around by their heartstrings, and this can't end well.  There's an argument that it's a bad idea for a company to yield to whoever claims the most hurt because this incentivises people to claim hurt, which sets up a terrible incentive structure of competitive offense-taking and self-modification into being the most hurtable person around. But this argument is fairly cynical as well as existing at an abstruse meta level of concern, so it probably won't move anyone.  Shit's fucked, yo. And I have no good ideas for how to deal with it.  I can say that this is avoidable if caught at an early age, though. I have an autistic relative who used to get very upset when he was younger, who might have grown up this way. Instead, his father would repeatedly grab him and drill into his head reminders like ""They're not out to get you"" and ""It's not an act of malice"". Eventually the sperg learned to say this himself. Probably too late to beat such proverbs into Awwcd, though."

The fiction sets this particular religion as not necessarily true. as it does with all the religions.  You're taking it at face value like Stannis is. You're meant to be the audience, not a participant."

It doesn't matter if other people in Westeros think the Lord of Light is a fringe religion; Stannis is sold on it, and so the actions he will do, from his perspective, will seem morally just. Therefor, from Stannis' point of view, his actions truly do ""make sense"", which is all the writer was trying to get at. Reprehensible actions to most everyone even in Westeros? Sure. But to Stannis? Not so much.  I'm not pro SJW by any stretch of it, but you're trying to start something here when there's absolutely nothing."

At no point should your internal problem become everyone else's. You are the exception not the rule. That's going to be your life, for better or worse. Sack up (or not as the case may be) and get on with it. Do what you will to make yourself feel better, within -and this is key - the sphere of your own life. No one owes you the psychically gleaned knowledge to use your prefered pronouns, or disregard their own gender or sexuality on your behalf. That's not their problem.  If someone is 'offended' by the word vagina it means they've got a fucking screw loose, or at the very least need to be told to fuck off. No one should be offended by a biologically accurate term.

This is not an attempt to run away from my debts, but a very personal decision.”   Since then there was another name change to ""Amber Coal"" and another attempt at embezzling money: https://twitter.com/tasha26/status/558978164211609600  Can we just allow anyone to change their name at will because they state so (not legally) or did something bad and be that regarded as ""fact"" everywhere?

If I say ""Hillary Clinton was born in 1947"", that's not revisionism: the person currently known as Hillary Clinton was in fact born then, even if that was not then her name.   He's a biological male which comes with the specific bodily characteristics.   I'm not sure what you're saying here.   There is already plenty of this insanity going around, in Denmark since Sept 2014, apparently anyone can declare they're female if they feel like it   God forbid we lower bureaucratic barriers!   which a guy that is married and has several children did, he then proceeded into a women's changing room at a gym and after being asked to leave sued the gym because of being legally considered ""female"", he is apparently doing this to attract attention to the insanity of such a law: https://archive.is/ySGGI   So a guy exploited a law designed to give recognition to a marginalized minority to go be a horrible asshole in order to...what, show that he can?

It's also totally irrelevant to the topic at hand.   Can we just allow anyone to change their name at will because they state so (not legally) or did something bad and be that regarded as ""fact"" everywhere?   People can change their names at will.

If you don't know what this means, it's that they had sex (Bruce Jenner inserted his penis in the women's vaginas, transferred his sperm via intercourse and they birthed said children), this is not possible for a woman to do.  Fact: Bruce Jenner won the gold medal in the men's decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. He was declared Male Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press.  There are articles and photos of said historic events.

If you talked about these issues, hey more power to you and I'd be on your side, basic human rights for everyone, love in one's family and not being denied housing based on spurious reasons are issues that almost everyone can get behind and these have absolutely nothing to do with making everyone forcefully refer to someone by their ""new name"" or else instead of the one they had been using for 65 years and trying to erase any evidence of the existence of said person for said period of time or reffering to them as ever having been male.  You're not going to make a lot of friends with that confrontational attitude, and frankly reality-bubbles aren't very useful over long periods of time, it just leads to seething and backlash. The somewhat reasonable discussion in the YouTube video above makes ""trans"" issues a lot more concrete and sympathetic than calling everyone ""transphobic"" because they aren't using quite the right terminology you want them to use or doesn't pretend this person has always been a woman, no matter what all those papers and photos and TV recordings say."

SocialJusticeInAction,38otuh,Folsomdsf,4,Fri Jun 5 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, ""rape culture is a concept in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality.""  No, as I've heard it described, I don't think it exists.  Rape is one of our society's most serious crimes.  Anyone who is known to have committed the crime faces total social ostracism, even if they aren't charged with anything.  Some feminists think that men don't take certain kinds of rape seriously, like if someone withdraws their consent during sex or ""if your mouth says no but your body says yes.""  I really disagree, consent is pretty simple, no means no, almost every guy knows this.  There have been some cases where coaches, parents, or authority figures have covered up cases of rape in order to protect students.  We are told this is evidence of rape culture.  No, this is evidence of people protecting criminals.  I have seen countless acts on the news, and witnessed myself, violent and despicable crimes committed by people whose families or communities protect them.  Child is beaten with a baseball bat, the perpetrator's mother spreads lies about the kid.  Why does this happen?  It's just instinct, it's hard to send someone you love or care for to prison, even if they deserve to be there.  There is nothing in particular about our attitude as a society toward rape that makes people look the other way.    Unlike other crimes, criminal responsibility for rape is usually very hard to determine.  The question of whether or not someone consented to sex sometimes has to come down to their word against someone else's.  As a result, we are skeptical about taking action against an alleged rape.  As we have the right to be.  We don't want to jump to conclusions without evidence.  Some feminists claim that this indecisiveness is indicative of our culture's tolerance of rape.  But some feminists will claim a lot of things without evidence."

Do I think it's problematic that sexual assault kits are not processed? Or that sexual assault in prison is so pervasive, and that politicians refuse to enact reforms to make the situation better? To both these question my answer is yes. I think there is a problem in law enforcement, both in handling victims and potential perpetrators, but I don't think it's because they don't think rape is bad, but because there is no money in solving a complicated rape case. It's more about funding then it is about contempt.  Do I think there is a rape culture? No, not in the way the SJW present it, with a mean rapist lurking behind every corner.

Because of this, I am sorry that I must rescind your invitation and I will not be able to accept or include your talk at the conference.   An organized sampling of said opinions:  http://moldbuggery.blogspot.com/  The predictable SJW cheering while pretending to be bored and above it all:  https://archive.is/wAENT   The reason I joined the call for Urbit’s author’s invitation to be rescinded is not his political views...Strewn throughout the Urbit author’s writings are statements in support of racism and slavery. To my mind, this is where the line is crossed from the abstract debate of politics into something more visceral and emotional: hate.   ...What does concern me is the idea that Strange Loop attendees would no longer feel welcome because an avowed racist and proponent of slavery has been given a tacit endorsement by virtue of his speaking slot.  That speaking slot, of course, was not intended for a discussion of politics or race or slavery. It was intended for a discussion of software. And wouldn’t it be tidy to assume that we can separate the two, leaving our identities backstage as we step up to a podium of pure ideas? Untidily, this is not how the real world functions.   One response to the above:   You might think that one’s stance on the admissibility of slavery is a political view, and therefore he was indeed uninvited for his political views. But if you take it upon yourself to decide what is or is not a political view, then it’s quite easy to claim you are neither afraid of, shocked by, nor censorious of any political view.    As with Vox Day, the accusations conveniently fail to provide quotes, because the more the SJW's quote, the more they undermine their point-and-shriek hysteria.

""Lame""   Yeah, maybe in the 19th Century, things have moved on.  Interesting caveat, first time I ever got 'tone' policed was because I used the word 'lame', this was several years ago, when SJW's were just starting their brutal takeover bid.   ""Retarded""   Well, of course SJW's would like that word banned, since they're the ones the insult is most likely to levied at.   ""Colored""   &   ""colored"" while advocating for diversity in film during an interview. (No, the irony is not lost.)   Yeah, I think the SJW's lost the irony all right, buried it, moved to the lunatic asylum and then forgot where they left it.  How is this actually different from People of Colour anyway?     ""OCD""   OCD is different from OCPD, (obsessive compulsive personality disorder).    ""Derp""   This is so hilarious, Matt and Trey of South Park fame came up with this word.  Later in an episode of South Park, they did an episode about how words change meaning over time.   ""Crazy""   It's OK, it's fine.  Loads of people suffer from mental illness, including myself (I know you're all shocked right? 'A ranting poster on Reddit has a mental illness? NO!') but most don't mind.  In fact the word 'crazy' has probably never been used in a professional setting, well, to a patients face anyway.   ""Tranny""   An SJW is actually going to 'skool' an actual 'tranny' on the use of the word 'tranny'.  Amazing. A black, gay, drag-queen is going to actually be lectured at, by a whiny, white clickbait blogging, slightly overweight, unattractive white girl.  Why is it SJW's always remind me of old plantation owners or over-zealous missionaries from Victorian England out to tell the natives how to cover their shame.   ""Illegal""   I'm not a migrant hater or anything, and believe me, in the UK we get a lot of migrants.  But people can be 'illegal', not because being a person is illegal, but the action of entering a country illegally and intending to work without a visa is illegal.  I think this is a pretty underhanded attempt to shame people who are attempting immigration reform, or limits.   People can be 'illegal' through their actions.   ""Gyp""   Yeah, well let's see how you feel after they pave your driveway.   ""Exotic""   Never been considered an insult, unless you're crazy.   ""Ghetto""   This is an example of how words change.  And what should we call; shitty-semi-inner-city-slums then?  Maybe a less offensive word so feminist bloggers can sleep better at night knowing no one lives in a 'ghetto' any more, since we changed the name.   ""Fat""   Yeah, yeah, yeah, no one's ever fat, even when they're lying on a mattress on the floor gasping for oxygen and washing themselves with a rag on a stick.  This is really dangerous because many people actually do want support from their doctors, but if this becomes a taboo subject no doctor dare breach and no government dare fund then it will lead to more people not getting help they desperately want.

By that, I mean that trans people have such distress (that they do not choose to have) so that a lack of transition is a road to depression, self-harming, and eventually, suicide. Half of UK trans people attempt suicide before the age of 20, and that's in a country where if you survive for a couple of years, you get your transition free off the state.  It's the same thing for any condition. Got bipolar disorder? Got ulcerative colitis? You didn't choose your symptoms, but you do choose your method(s) of treatment, or lack of it.

Feminists and anti-racists recognize that identity does matter. This is indisputable. If we subscribe to the belief that ideas can be judged within a vacuum, uninfluenced by the social weight of their proponents, we perpetuate a system in which arbitrary markers like race and gender influence the perceived correctness of ideas. We can't overcome prejudice by pretending it doesn't exist. Focusing on identity allows us to interrogate the process through which white males have their opinions taken at face value, while women, people of color, and non-normatively gendered people struggle to have their voices heard.   I have zero sympathy for Schlosser when he gets hoist by his own petard, then continues laying petards. In the above paragraph, for instance, he's cheering the ad hominem fallacy while still spouting gibberish like ""interrogate the process"" and ""non-normatively gendered people"". (Processes don't talk. The word you want is examine.)  Moreover, Schlosser complains of ""the extreme of ... misplaced extremism ... "" and other ways of saying that someone has gone too far. Well, why should I buy his baseline of how far is far enough? Personally I think it had gone too far about a quarter-millennium ago when a bunch of violent movements around the globe declared that the correct form of government is one derived from how the people feel about their government, so when Schlosser says he's very concerned that his job and his tenure rest on how the students feel about what he's saying - ha ha!

How would an employer even get away with it? Aren't most wages defined before the position is filled? Why would you employ a man if you know you can get away with employing a woman to do the same job, but cheaper?  Women are the only ones who get pregnant, which means they represent a higher potential cost for the employer. Wouldn't that alone make employers more hesitant to hire women for certain positions? It's just a hypothesis I have no way of verifying, but taking Occam's razor into account it seems a hell of a lot more plausible than "" because patriarchy"".  Actually, when you think about it, wouldn't the natural career choices different individuals take influence that? If you want to talk about gender roles, since men were traditionally expected to be the breadwinners of the household, wouldn't that make it more likely that men would take higher-paying jobs as opposed to having a career in something that pays less, but it's what they want?   Given a ""natural state"", devoid of external cultural influences, do we even know that there should be no wage gap? How could we possibly know that?"

Your point goes with the exact reason why I created this post; a female classmate said ""I had no idea that by checking the 'female' box that I was already signing up to earn less.""

SocialJusticeInAction,38gbbj,Giorria_Dubh,2,Thu Jun 4 06:54:07 2015 UTC,"Aren't most wages defined before the position is filled?   In most jobs, yes, especially in ones with lots of well defined positions all working alongside each other. McDonald's could never do it without being blatantly obvious for example. It's more something which can come into play when positions are less well defined and companies only hire one or two of each position. For example, there might be only one janitor in a school, so if they (hypothetically) hired a female janitor at 2/3rds of what they would pay for a male, it wouldn't necessarily be provable that they had done so.   Women are the only ones who get pregnant, which means they represent a higher potential cost for the employer. Wouldn't that alone make employers more hesitant to hire women for certain positions?   Yes. The government solution to this is to make it illegal to ask if a candidate is pregnant, married, or planning on starting a family, but this just pushes the cost out on all women, rather than specifically women who plan on being primary carers. It's a bit like how rules on insurance shift responsibility around among demographics. Ultimately though, this has more of an impact on access to jobs rather than wages once the position has been given. The wage gap only applies when women start taking maternity leave and time off to care for their kids. Single women, childless couples and lesbians don't tend to take the hit.   Actually, when you think about it, wouldn't the natural career choices different individuals take influence that? If you want to talk about gender roles, since men were traditionally expected to be the breadwinners of the household, wouldn't that make it more likely that men would take higher-paying jobs as opposed to having a career in something that pays less, but it's what they want?   Yes. Enormously. Career type is the single largest factor in determining how much you'll earn in real wages. After that it's hours worked.   Given a ""natural state"", devoid of external cultural influences, do we even know that there should be no wage gap? How could we possibly know that?   Well, we can control for alot of stuff, and perform the same tests across various different countries, but I haven't seen much to suggest sexist hiring practices are a thing in the west. And in countries where they exist, they mostly benefit women (chinese factories often refuse to hire men because they have higher expectations)"

I imagine these tendencies are kind of created by fixed gender roles, but then again I'm not sure if gender roles are entirely dictated by culture and, if not, to what extent. Given biological differences between the sexes, it's not hard to imagine how these roles might evolve naturally. Then there's the question of whether it's possible at all to eliminate gender roles and, at last, if there's anything to be gained from it... it's all too complicated but it's definitely a discussion worth having. My problem with the current popular brand of feminism is that it stops these kinds of discussions with all too simple solutions to complicated questions.  Don't get me wrong about gender roles - I'm very aware of the things people expected from me being a male that I didn't actually want to do or be.

It is related to xenomelia, ""the oppressive feeling that one or more limbs of one's body do not belong to one's self"".   BIID is typically accompanied by the desire to amputate one or more healthy limbs to achieve that end. BIID can be associated with apotemnophilia, sexual arousal based on the image of one's self as an amputee. The cause of BIID is unknown. One theory states that the cause of BIID is a neurological failing of the brain's inner body mapping function (located in the right parietal lobe). According to this theory, the brain mapping does not incorporate the affected limb in its understanding of the body's physical form.

If you need to do a thorough investigation to classify a report as false, but you can’t ask too many questions, you can’t challenge the validity of their story, and you probably shouldn’t be wasting time trying to investigate a false report, how can a report every be classified as false?    Finally, we get to what I think is the most deceptive part of their false report statistics.  When they say that only 2-8% of rape reports are false, the implication is that the rest are true.  At the end of the day, my point is this – If someone tries to advocate a particular policy based on the fact that “only 2-8% of rape reports are false” an appropriate response might be “Sure, but only 1-8% are true.”"
SocialJusticeInAction,38aoao,AntonioOfVenice,2,Wed Jun 3 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone who talks about rape statistics and false rape reports has an agenda. Feminists do, and yes, radicals MRAs most certainly do as well.  I have a hard time believing that false rape accusations are as big a problem as radical MRAs claim. Rape victims are often attacked and blamed for what happened to them. This deters many real victims from reporting the crime - making rape one of the most underreported crimes. How many people are willing to make up an accusation just to get back at a man they dislike or to get support from the SRS-crowd? Given the great underreporting, I would guess that the number is not extremely huge.   At the same time, I find it bizarre that feminists oppose any kind of punishment for rape accusations that are demonstrably false. Feminists in England opposed a judge imposing a relatively mild sentence on a woman who had made up 11 demonstrably false rape accusations.  Here is a balanced piece by Cathy Young, a CHS-style egalitarian feminist: http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/09/false_rape_accusations_why_must_be_pretend_they_never_happen.html"

Otherwise he would be harassed and attacked by masculinist men (the artificial gender role for men).     That's not actually what ""masculinist"" means. Women do a fair amount of enforcement of gender roles themselves, for men and women.   Also, last time I checked, don't trans people generally feel that their body is wrong? I'm not talking ""I should do some crunches"" but that their body is the wrong gender? There's nothing stopping a transwoman from being butch as a he, and still butch as a she. In fact, this is a bigoted, stereotypical view of transwomen. And notice how transmen are just left out of the equation entirely.   What if white people decided they were black people born in a white body and wanted to ""become"" black people and enter black people's space after operations and skin color technology made them look black?    Oh, you mean like in the critically acclaimed book ""Black Like Me""?   Also Robin Morgan in her book ""An Anatomy of Freedom"" wrote that if under patriarchy women see themselves through mens eyes, where ARE they if they cant see themselves as women? Where is their self concept?   Last time I checked, a great deal of society's mores involved the way men are seen by women too.

SocialJusticeInAction,384znn,seeker9709,8,Tue Jun 2 00:18:54 2015 UTC,"One of the four key stories told in the film illustrates both of these points. It is the harrowing account of Kamilah Willingham, who describes what happened during the early morning hours of Jan. 15, 2011, while she was a student at Harvard Law School. She says a male classmate, a man she thought was her friend, drugged the drinks he bought at a bar for her and a female friend, then took the two women back to Willingham’s apartment and sexually assaulted them. When she reported this to Harvard, she says university officials were indifferent and even hostile to her. “He’s dangerous,” she says in the film of her alleged attacker, as she tries to keep her composure. “This is a rapist. This is a guy who’s a sexual predator, who assaulted two girls in one night.”    In actuality...   Harvard did not ignore her complaints; the school thoroughly investigated them. And because of her allegations, the law school education of her alleged assailant has been halted for the past four years.  There was no mention during the five-day trial of Winston [the accused] drugging anyone’s drinks, a key accusation Willingham makes in The Hunting Ground.    Willingham also accused Winston of raping her female friend because of a condom she found in her wastebasket. Tests showed that the DNA belonged to Willingham and an unidentified male, not Winston.   Judge Maynard Kirpalani, in his decision to allow [the condom as evidence], wrote, “This evidence is relevant, at a minimum, to demonstrate Willingham’s bias against the defendant, as the jury could infer that Willingham knew, at the time that she questioned the defendant about the condom, that the condom was not his. The jury could further infer that her questioning of the defendant was disingenuous.” Willingham testified she had no idea how the condom had gotten in her wastebasket. She said during cross-examination, “Of course I didn’t know it was mine.”   Non-archive link in case you want to reward Slate for these kind of articles."

As a rape victim, I am acutely aware of the negative effects (on both the victim and the assailant) of accusing someone of a sexual offense, which is why I go crazy when I see people screaming rape in situations where they gave consent or were drunk or decided they don't like the person.   In hindsight, you're totally right; I don't know anything about this girl's relationship. For all I know, she was being raped repeatedly and that is horrifying, and I hope that's not the case. What I'm worried about is girls seeing her post and then deciding, ""I don't like how my boyfriend acted when we had consensual sex, so that must make it rape."" She took it upon herself to publicize this information, so I don't feel in the wrong for reposting and criticizing it, but I don't want to come off as brash/unfeeling for having questioned her logic. I'm very sensitive to issues of rape, especially how we define it and how we treat victims who report it. I don't mean to minimize anyone's legitimate experiences. I just hope people don't start throwing the accusation around--it will serve to undermine victims of actual rape and will ruin the lives of the wrongfully accused.

I empathize, and I'm damn glad she got out of that situation. If the story ended with a warning to other women to avoid such situations, there would be no problem.   ...Then she gets into issues of entitlement. She argues that every coercive instance was rape, and labels the relationship as an ongoing system of abuse. Entitlement of women's bodies, abuse of women in relationships, and rape are all obvious issues we need to rally against. When she uses all three topics in her own relationship, it comes across as hyperbole. It trivializes all three very grave topics.   People like this have good ideas.

I love this shaming language that SJWs use, although if I wouldn't date her, that might mean I'm a slut shamer, which is the bad kind of shaming!"

SocialJusticeInAction,37r8xa,redditthrowawaykin,18,Fri May 29 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"Lauren Kipnis, a media studies professor who identifies as a feminist, wrote an article decrying the recent Title IX abuses and mocking the attitude that professors need to treat students like they're infantile morons (article is quite worth reading, btw).   As a result, students staged a protest and filed Title IX complaints against Kipnis. The investigators refused to disclose the contents of these complaints until Kipnis met with them for her interrogation. She was denied the presence of an attorney, though she could bring a supporter.  At the interrogation, she learned that the charges were 1) her essay ""had a 'chilling effect' on the students' ability to report sexual misconduct"" and 2) her essay anonymously mentioned a student involved in a public lawsuit against another professor. The complainer felt mentioning this student was ""retaliatory"".  Kipnis was asked to keep the charges confidential, but a graduate student published an article in HuffPo detailing the charges and denigrating Kipnis anyway.  Meanwhile, the faculty member who was her supporter in the interrogation has been hit with Title IX charges himself. He apparently discussed Kipnis' situation in a faculty senate meeting (after the HuffPo article had already made the charges public) and this was enough basis for retaliation complaints.  A modern day Kafka trial."
SocialJusticeInAction,37r8xa,wisty,9,Fri May 29 19:20:51 2015 UTC,"Among the problems with treating students like children is that they become increasingly childlike in response. The New York Times Magazine recently reported on the tangled story of a 21-year-old former Stanford undergraduate suing a 29-year-old tech entrepreneur she’d dated for a year. He’d been a mentor in a business class she was enrolled in, though they’d met long before. They traveled together and spent time with each other’s families. Marriage was discussed. After they broke up, she charged that their consensual relationship had actually been psychological kidnapping, and that she’d been raped every time they’d had sex. She seems to regard herself as a helpless child in a woman’s body. She demanded that Stanford investigate and is bringing a civil suit against the guy—this despite the fact that her own mother had introduced the couple, approved the relationship every step of the way, and been in more or less constant contact with the suitor.  No doubt some 21-year-olds are fragile and emotionally immature (helicopter parenting probably plays a role), but is this now to be our normative conception of personhood? A 21-year-old incapable of consent? A certain brand of radical feminist—the late Andrea Dworkin, for one—held that women’s consent was meaningless in the context of patriarchy, but Dworkin was generally considered an extremist. She’d have been gratified to hear that her convictions had finally gone mainstream, not merely driving campus policy but also shaping the basic social narratives of love and romance in our time.   wow"

Decisions still happened, but without an agreed-upon process, there was no accountability.  This religious core [of Quaker origins] was left unmentioned when consensus decision-making came to the world of secular activism.  But while Rice and Boardman were careful to exclude any explicit theology from their trainings on consensus, something of its religious origin adhered to the process nonetheless — including a deep faith in its rightness, a certain piety in its implementation, and a tendency to treat claims about consensus as foundational truths."

This doesn't seem like something to shame anyone over.  But that never stops SJWs.  Total digging involved here was one image search and two regular web searches.  Way to do your research, BBC!"

I've agreed with nearly everything I've heard her say (granted I haven't watched most of her videos), but here she's making arguments against women having the right to vote.  She hates feminism, which I totally get, but fighting for the right to vote is something that feminism got right.  At least admit to that.  I think her dislike for feminism is so great that she's not willing to concede even the most basic point.  I've seen this happen a lot where there's some argument to be made against the obvious so people make it, no matter how lopsided it is.  Contrarians are important because they're the ones who think critically and skeptically about social norms, but they can also take it too far which I think is the case here."
SocialJusticeInAction,37ha2m,Jesus_marley,9,Thu May 28 18:11:01 2015 UTC,"but here she's making arguments against women having the right to vote.   Not even in the slightest. She was arguing that women would have been granted the right to vote regardless of the efforts of the suffragettes. The vote was already expanding naturally and most of the resistance to th franchise was from women who believed that they would be subject to the draft  and didn't want the attached social responsibility that was expected of men in exchange of voting rights.  So yeah, Karen is right in not thanking feminists for the vote because feminism is taking credit for ""winning"" the franchise when they were being given it  away, and without any of the social costs that men to this day are expected to shoulder for the very same thing."

We are living Heinlein's XX century because of that mistake, and it will end poorly.  Women in general do not want the responsibility that MUST come with franchise.  Nor are they physically suited to that responsibility.  Nor can a society endure that presses them into that responsibility.  It is BECAUSE franchise was given without responsibility that our country is on a trajectory for disaster today.   Feminism tried to cheat the Sword of Damocles.

SocialJusticeInAction,377xw6,LWMR,2,Tue May 26 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"Fuck Vox for a grievancemongering shitstirrer of a medium.  I think this might be a good counterexample to that endlessly-spammed GoT quote about cutting out a man's tongue. Sometimes you want to mute a spammer because he is poisoning race relations and encouraging bitterness and hate and generally making the world marginally worse, not because you fear anything he has to say.   the New Yorker fully complied with what Michel calls the Law of Media: ""in which underrepresentation of minorities and females is the default setting for any given media outlet.""   Underrepresentation COMPARED TO WHAT? There is no reason to expect New-Yorker-Cartoon-Characters to match any particular racial or sexual quota. They are not democratically elected representatives (hey, there's that word again, hmm, I wonder why) chosen to represent (again!) the people -- and even assuming that a representative democracy (it keeps popping up!) should have racial quotas depends on the assumption that people vote their race, which is usually a bad sign.  This is like complaining that the Ow My Balls show doesn't have enough mountains in the background, and that, I feel, is a very generous comparison that highlights only the stupidity of the Law of Media, not the insinuation of malice.  There's a white nationalist argument I've seen a couple of places which goes something like this:   They [unspecified, ominous ""they"", sometimes the Jews] know the game would be up if they outright called whites evil and forbade whites to do anything. So instead they call everything whites could possibly do evil, each for a different reason, and tell them to stop that. Racial discrimination is bigotry and that's evil, but racial colorblindness erases black people's identity and that's also evil, and fetishization of black people reduces black people to objects, which, guess what, is evil. Gentrification is evil, white flight is also evil.   The original screed goes on far longer, but I believe this summary is sufficient for one to understand that this Vox article is exactly the sort of thing which makes the white nationalists' point. Vox is grabbing a random microslice of culture and taking up the cry of ""this microslice is too white""* where anyone with a lick of sense would realize that such microslices a) should be able to set their own racial policy without Vox making them the subject of a national conversation, and b) shouldn't be expected to be perfectly racially homogenous.  You could find a million other articles like it complaining about other microslices: mountain climbing is too white, composting is too white, Burning Man is too white, just to name a few I've seen off the top of my head. Added up, ironically, it starts to be exactly the sort of institutional/structural racism and microaggressions that progressives love to complain about, except directed against whites.  *  And too male. Similar reasoning applies for MGTOW or whatever one has in place of men-nationalists."
SocialJusticeInAction,377xw6,AlseidesDD,1 point,Tue May 26 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"While I understand that one of the major reasons for diversity in fictional media is to combat the effect it has on impressionable audience on perceptions of race and gender, there always seems to be a crucial oversight in assigning the root cause of those portrayals to the fictional works themselves as opposed to it being a symptom that is reflective of the society and culture in which those works are created.  The analysis even remarks that male artists tend to create more men characters and female artists tend to create more women characters. Fictional works are, by and large, mostly derived from the internal perspectives of their creators, which are rarely representative of the whole of society, much less the facet or niche of society those particular creators hail from.  Theoretically, if you change the fictional works to be diverse, you will only have achieved that: Diversity in a make-believe place. The lack of diversity in the real world, however, is barely affected by this change due to causation stemming from hard socioeconomic and cultural nuances within the society in question.  There is also the fact that those impressionable people who perceive fictional material as a reflection of reality having far more critical issues that go beyond their perspectives on racial/gender stereotypes, namely the inability to differentiate between real and not-real."

I'd like to see moderate feminists actually engage with this and either post a rebuttal or acknowledge the issue.  To play devil's advocate, regarding point #2 the lack of representation: moderate feminists often blame clickbait media for focusing on batshit insane feminists because they bring in the clicks/views. I'm not sure what the solution to this would be. Mainstream media belives there is no audience for actual nuanced reasonable discussion on gender issues.  Back in 2008, the blog Feminist Critics had a discussion on this very issue. The term they used was ""Government Feminism.""   The pushback from moderate feminists in that thread and subsequent threads generally boiled down to ""I called myself a feminist first! Why do I have to give up my identification to those crazies? It's as unfair to say 'feminists are bad!' without any qualifiers as it is to say 'men are rapists!' "" Their defenses generally make it into a semantics, identity issue...

SocialJusticeInAction,36rip6,AntithesisD,8,Thu May 21 15:31:43 2015 UTC,Shouldn't we be happy that women are starting to distance themselves from feminism? Isn't the end goal of feminism to remove the need for feminism? Isn't a good indicator of feminism's success the amount of women who declare they do not need feminism?  What about all the crazy that goes on within feminism? Can no one criticize that or be turned away due to it?  Should everyone love every aspect of it? I don't think anyone hates what feminism has done in the past (which Mark Ruffallo talks about) I think people don't like it because of the present.  The fact that Mark doesn't mention modern day feminism at all tells me he is completely ignorant of what actions it has taken recently.  Obviously Mark Ruffallo lacks in the logic department.

Teach them that the appropriate response to these ""microaggressions"" is to be extremely upset and angry, possibly to file a complaint with management or HR. Tell them (and convince HR) that a man defending himself from such a complaint is itself sexism and oppression. This will ensure the women always believe they are being oppressed, that they always feel uncomfortable, and that their male co-workers will never feel comfortable with them and will be apprehensive if they are anywhere around.  Then, once you've done this, blame the toxic environment you've created on male sexism. It's a positive feedback loop."

SocialJusticeInAction,366i24,md1957,5,Sat May 16 17:03:26 2015 UTC,"The article from Spiked Online's education editor, Joanna Williams, is a review of a book entitled * Freedom Fallacy*. And in so doing rips open the book's premises as well as takes on the sort of feminists who see no problem slandering others, including women for being gender-traitors, implicitly supporting the patriarchy or not supporting their brand of feminism in general.   The contributors to Freedom Fallacy are critical of women who challenge the view that patriarchy creates ‘a dominant group (men) that holds systemic, individual power over an oppressed group (women)’. They either scorn or pity women who want ‘sexual harassment rebranded as harmless banter’ or argue that ‘objectification is the new empowerment’. Unfortunately, this, like much of the analysis presented in Freedom Fallacy, seems to be at least a decade out of date. The description of a generation of sassy, confident women telling the world they are free to make their own choices stands in sad contrast to many of today’s young feminists, who seem all too ready to declare themselves vulnerable to everyday sexism, fat-shamed by adverts, the targets of rape-culture if they are catcalled in the street, or victims of lad culture if they are chatted up in the university bar. Calls for censorship, trigger warnings and safe spaces seem to be far more the hallmark of modern-day feminism than women arguing sexual harassment is harmless banter. In such a climate, suggesting that women are oppressed, have little agency and are unable to make ‘authentic choices’ simply reinforces mainstream feminist thought."

The author of the Slate piece has an article about Thomas Piketty, who is also mentioned in the AR piece, but otherwise I'm not sure.  If it's the same person, I'd be interested to hear him reconcile the two pieces. Gamergate is a bit of a hodge-podge; It's about ethics in journalism, but because the journalism in question is tainted by the exact kind of contradictory social justice described here, a greater discussion of liberal ideology and gender dynamic gets drawn into it. Gamergate is about people pissed off because leftists like those described in the topic starting article have begun to infect what was already shitty journalism; similarly, gamers have been slandered as members of a privileged class, and thus victims of the callout culture discussed.  The unfortunate consequence is that, because the attacks on gaming culture come from leftists, the (majority liberal) members of Gamergate find allies on the right (Milo writes for Breitbart, ffs) and among anti-feminists, both reasonable (Honey Badgers and Christina Hoff Summers) and outright misogynistic. And of course, trolls who ultimately hurt the movement.

SocialJusticeInAction,35jytq,wisty,3,Mon May 11 02:30:59 2015 UTC,"I thought this interview was basically smoke and mirrors from Mark Potok, and that Pakman was pretty much giving him a soapbox to stand on, without picking him up on anything.   Potok starts off with a lot of sweeping claims about Men's rights sites, saying that:   The sites contain an incredible amount of misogyny/defamation of women.  One the themes that runs through all/most of those websites is the idea that women routinely lie about rape; that they claim they were raped in order to destroy men/get advantages over men.  The sites are filled with incredible vitriol.  Most of it is just untrammeled hatred directed at women.   He talks about a whole ""world"" of these sites, yet from all these he only specifically talks about two sites and their contents: Register-her.com and a subreddit called ""Philosophy of rape.""   The latter isn't even anything to do with men's rights, yet Potok transitions from talking about men's rights issues and sites to mentioning the subreddit as one of ""these websites"" as if he were still talking about the same category of thing. Pakman allows him to do so unchallenged.  Register-her.com is an interesting choice, because its old content has been stripped from the site—I guess we will have to just rely on Potok's claims about what it said (a transcript I made as faithfully as I could):   “Register-her.com was a vile site which put up pictures, sometimes personal information, names and so on, of various enemies of the Men’s Rights Movement. Some of those people are feminists, some of those women are on the order of Lorena Bobbitt—okay, I guess she wasn’t very friendly to men, but an enormous number are simply women who in some way identify as feminist, have in some way offended the men in the Men’s rights movement. In other words, women who are guilty of no crime—yet this website says these women should be prosecuted, they should be in jail, and so on.”   Oh wait, the WayBackMachine exists. Let's have a look at an old version of the site and compare claims to reality.  The vast majority of the women on the site are convicted criminals. Killers, rapists, pedophiles, violent offenders, and false accusers. They are only listed with proof from media and court records.  There is a small listing of fifteen people under the category ""bigot,"" not even directly linked to from the main page. Here are a couple of examples:  Amanda Marcotte  Jessica Valenti  I notice no calls for the feminists labelled ""bigots"" to be jailed, so who are they talking about when they ask ""Why are these women not in prison?"" It's right there on the main page.  The site should have been criticized for what it actually was; or rather, as a ""world"" of these sites exist, surely a ""world"" of easily verifiable quotes from readily identifiable MRAs exist—from sites that are still online and can be checked out by people first-hand. Why wouldn't Potok want that?  Which has me also wonder why the latter half of an interview about Men's Rights Activists was spent discussing people who have no connection to the Men's Rights Movement (serial killers and the like). If there is a whole ""world"" of hatred, misogyny, and vitriol in the Men's Rights Movement, openly on display on their websites, then surely that is plenty of meat for an interview, without having to drag in unrelated figures."
SocialJusticeInAction,35jytq,snoopyzanus,3,Mon May 11 16:03:37 2015 UTC,Damn good response.  I've notice Pakman has a clear bias and applies different logic based on the situation.  Just watch how he tries to justify his identifying as a Feminist in his recent video while at the same time painting all the equality feminists bad and at the same time trying to use the No True Scotsman fallacy to tar MRAs.  That's right he makes the No True Scotsman fallacy to deflect criticism in the same breath as he painting another group bad and claims they try to use the No True Scotsman fallacy to deflect criticism  HeadDesk
SocialJusticeInAction,35jytq,Insaniac99,3,Mon May 11 20:47:52 2015 UTC,I've notice Pakman has a clear bias   I've noticed too. But this extends only to feminism. I believe it is due to his lack of knowledge about mainstream academic feminism and feminist media.
SocialJusticeInAction,35jytq,Matthew1J,3,Tue May 12 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"I just watched the video you mention.  The main problem I have with Pakman framing things as being moderate feminists versus a minority of radical/third-wave feminists, is that numbers aren't the only thing that counts—who is being politically active? Who has power and influence?  I think of feminism as a pyramid with moderate ""feminism is just about equality"" feminists at the broad base. Yeah, there are a lot of them, but they are not politically active themselves. The base is passive. They are mainly useful to the feminists who are politically active, because they give the active feminists the appearance of feminism having wide-spread support.  What are the politics of the active feminists? The ones pushing for policies in business, laws in government? Making demands of companies as consumers? Making demands that individuals conform? Where are the moderates here?  And then at the very tip of the pyramid you have the distilled essence of feminism in action. What do I mean by that? When feminists lobby for something, a large concerted group has to lobby for ""A."" If 26 different groups are lobbying for ""A,"" ""B,"" C,"" etc, all the way to ""Z,"" then the lobbying efforts are likely to fail. The successful lobbying efforts are the ones who get the most support from active feminists regardless of what specific branch of feminism the lobbyists came from. This, to me, is mainstream feminism."
SocialJusticeInAction,35jytq,snoopyzanus,2,Tue May 12 18:44:01 2015 UTC,Very interesting.  I also find it telling that Potok essentially criticizes register-her.com for exactly the behaviors and tactics employed by the SPLC.  ...except that the SPLC goes the extra step of actually taking people to court.

Killers, rapists, pedophiles, violent offenders, and false accusers. They are only listed with proof from media and court records   If you can't see why public shaming is a bad idea then you're part of the problem. On top of that 2 of the 5 women don't have any evidence of the accusations being false and 2 were already punished by court. (Whether it was mild punishment is for another debate). So register-her stands along with other problems mr Elam.  Imagine feminist site with doxx of rapists who ""allegedly"" avoided justice. Imagine feminist site with doxx of bigots. Would you be apologetic like you are with register-her after finding out that one of 5 was actually sentenced and 2 accusations don't have any evidence?  Even today you can go to avfm and see article from Indian homophobe and antisemite Amartya Talukdar arguing against marital rape law. He isn't advocating for equal rights for men. No. He's just a crazy conservative. On top of that, criticizing implications of his ""idea"" gets you banned from avfm for derailing. Like in some radfem hugbox.

I'm not going to get into debating the ins-and-outs because it's not my intention to defend the MRM here; it's to defend honest debate.  My intention was to point out that Potok made sweeping accusations about the movement in general that he didn't substantiate and then drastically misrepresented the Register-her site—no, let's not soft-peddle this. He lied. He also lumped in an utterly unrelated hateful (probably troll) subreddit in with MRA sites and then threw in a couple of unrelated school shooters/spree shooters to boot.  He didn't need to. If he had been intellectually honest and hadn't been lazy he could have built a case criticizing what some MRAs actually say, do, and state they believe.  The problem for him doing that is that that conversation would have been more nuanced instead of being simple, heavy-handed propaganda (which is more than enough for those who simply ""listen and believe"") and would have offered viewers the opportunity to go and check the particulars for themselves in order to make up their own minds.

SocialJusticeInAction,35fz7f,wisty,3,Sun May 10 00:15:31 2015 UTC,"The Dems and GoP aren't that far apart, in practice. Nor are the Tories and Labor. They mostly just have different rhetoric.  Almost every country that votes will get a choice between Diet Coke, and Diet Pepsi. Major parties almost always want to capture the centre. In the US, that centre is to the right of the UK."

(I'm a bot)     Students at the University of Western Australia say the decision to can controversial Danish academic Bjorn Lomborg's Australian Consensus Centre is a win for academic integrity and common sense.  The Australian Consensus Centre was going to be set up with the help of a $4 million Federal Government grant, but University Vice Chancellor Paul Johnson last night said the proposed centre was untenable and lacked academic support.  UWA student guild president Lizzy O'Shea said students were concerned about the impact the centre, inspired by self-proclaimed ""Sceptical environmentalist"" Dr Lomborg, could have on the university's reputation.

But they've managed to paint him as a climate denier, when his main argument is ""If climate action has about $2 benefit for $1 costs, why not spend most of the money on starving Africans instead?"".  His framework aims to prioritize humanitarian goals, according to economic costs and benefits. Climate doesn't come out on top, and that gets people mad.  He's been trying to open up shop in Australia (backed by an unpopular conservative government), and getting shouted down. There are valid criticisms of him and his work, but SocJus is just going ballistic."
SocialJusticeInAction,35fld7,the_nybbler,2,Sat May 9 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"Its interesting how Hoyt attacks the idea (promoted by the cultural feminists) that women created perfect peaceful happy equality-based societies...  Yet at the end jumps right back into cultural feminism, argues that men are more hierarchical and women more egalitarian (ignoring the fact that the Enlightenment-Individualist political tradition, which was built on egalitarianism, was the product of males), and that women are more social and better at social co-ordination and co-operation, etc.  She seems to inconsistently hop between cultural feminism and going against cultural feminism.   That said, I know she's a libertarian so I will generally read her sympathetically. Still, her thinking seems to be conflicted on gender issues."
SocialJusticeInAction,35fld7,YetAnotherCommenter,2,Sun May 10 04:38:24 2015 UTC,"She's going into biological determinism, the idea that men and women behave differently because of inherent biological differences.  That's anathema to SJWs; it does line up with cultural feminist views but I don't think she's endorsing cultural feminism as a whole.  I agree she's wrong about hierarchy too.   Men establish and challenge hierarchy in a manner different from the way women do, but women definitely do."

That's anathema to SJWs   At least in theory you're right, however I've seen plenty of SJWs endorse the cultural feminist/gender essentialist line... at least when its flattering to women. Sarkeesian's master's thesis, for instance, was quite heavily influenced by cultural feminism."

This is one of many shows totally fucking worth the subscription.  The show has some of the best moments of social media/social justice/internet drama/tech industry being completely and utterly shat on and it's fucking glorious.  It's done Mike Judge, who did Idiocracy and King of the Hill I mean...  If that hasn't managed to push you over into watching it, I can't think of what else to add.  SV's a fucking awesome show."
SocialJusticeInAction,35epup,BirdGangCawCaw,2,Sun May 10 01:20:42 2015 UTC,Agreed completely. The first four episodes were pretty good but I thought that the second half of season one was so fucking hilarious.  It does a great job of making fun of all those things you mentioned.

SocialJusticeInAction,35aykr,AntithesisD,17,Fri May 8 16:18:24 2015 UTC,"Response from a woman here.    I Have the Privilege of a Short Morning Routine    So do I. I eat, pee, get dressed, brush my hair, and go. Women don't have to wear makeup, and I'm pretty sure no one notices that I'm not wearing it.    I Have the Privilege of a Gender That Confers Authority    Given that the writer teaches, I find it odd they say this. Throughout my life, most of my teachers have been women. A woman runs the head of the department I'm currently majoring in. Most of the classes I've had taught by men have had rowdier students. Maybe students feel more comfortable undermining male authority?    I Have the Privilege of Peeing Standing Up    Women can do this. Most women don't know how to. That's their own choice. Apparently this guy has never heard of squatting, either. Women taking forever in the bathroom has nothing to do with patriarchy. We have extra business to take care of sometimes.    I Have the Privilege to Show Skin    So he says he's privileged because he can take off his shirt and go running. Well, he's never tried running bra-less. It isn't fun. Biology is the patriarchy!    I Have the Privilege to Move About Without Fear of Harassment, Assault, or Rape    That fear is created by media fearmongering. It is not based in reality. Seriously, I have never feared any of these things while out at night. Then again, I don't go out walking in seedy areas because I'm not a moron.    I Have the Privilege to Enjoy the Internet Without My Gender Being Assaulted    He says this while assaulting his own gender in his own article. lol  edit Forgot #7.    I Have the Privilege of Seeing Myself Widely and Positively Represented in the Media    This one is weird. I don't understand how he could think women aren't widely and positively represented in media. I feel like an asshole for watching ads where a guy is a moron or a loser and a woman chose the right product (every 20 minutes you see this BS). Another one that bothers me is small, skinny women beating up big, burly men in TV shows. Fuck plot armor. If she's going to beat him, make it her smarts, not her imaginary strength."
SocialJusticeInAction,35aykr,TheAtomicMango,6,Sat May 9 02:18:11 2015 UTC,"#5 is funny 'cause men make up the majority of violent crime victims.   Also, if you include prisons, far more men are raped in the US than women.   In fact, the term ""rape culture"" was originally used to describe what goes on in prisons, but feminists co-opted the term."

I work at a tech company.  This is exactly backwards, it's the men who have to wait.  Women: if you want potty superiority, come work in tech.  ""Such availability is not the norm for many women’s bathrooms, a fact I learned in the late nineties at an Ani Difranco concert""  You should have tried a football game instead; I assure you the situations would have been reversed (even today, fans who go to the stadium skew male, though not as much as in the 90s)  ""4.

SocialJusticeInAction,35aykr,PhantomofaWriter,3,Sat May 9 21:33:42 2015 UTC,"Let's see, in order of the points he's trying to make, my comments about them. (Context for several of my comments: I was raised female, currently transitioning to male due to dysphoria and still treated as female by nearly everyone.)   Even when I lived as a woman, I had a short routine because I still never wore makeup. That's rather a sexist assumption, isn't it? What I saw, for example, was a lot of female employers and my mom was very capable while my dad was an idiot.  There are stand to pee devices for those sans penis. The ability to pee standing up isn't conferred by society, so trying to use the privilege argument doesn't work anyway! Privilege as a concept is given by society and society didn't suddenly decide ""men are gonna have the stick-out bits and women will have the internal bits."" If someone thinks that, well, they really don't understand how evolution works at all. Dress in stripper gear. You'll not be treated well for it, regardless of gender. The style of clothing is kind of important about whether or not showing skin is considered okay. My brother and I would mock high school jocks who'd wear shorts in snowy, freezing weather back when I was in high school, for example. Men are more likely to be physically assaulted, particularly by strangers. Meanwhile, women are taught to fear strangers assaulting and raping them, despite how that is incredibly uncommon. I remember being taught in middle school by the school to put keys between my fingers so I could fight back. And, though trans people have higher rates of assault than cis people, it's really disgusting that the author treats us as a bullet point for his argument. Instead of wanting to bring people up, so there is less rape and assault, it's instead ""feel guilty because you're not as often a victim of certain crimes as x group."" Clearly, the author either doesn't understand why Girl on the Internet Syndrome is so hated or just doesn't care. The idea of it is that someone who is constantly flaunting their gender like that is doing so to manipulate others, to get special perks, and to get white knights to do work for them. That depends on region and context of story, asshole. You live in a primarily white country. If you were in Saudi Arabia or Japan, you sure as hell wouldn't see too many white characters in the media. Some groups are also relatively small (LGBT in particular; LGB is about 5-10%, but T is 0.3%), so having a glut of those characters makes little to no sense, barring specific speculative fiction situations (aliens with a different demographic mix, alternate universe, etc.)."

SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,BurnerNumber3,1 point,Thu May 7 18:24:31 2015 UTC,You are straw manning pretty hard there.  This is where the fringe parts of gg lose me. People who objectively discuss race in America are not automatically social justice warriors. Mischaracterizing a few parts of a book does not a social justice canon make.
SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,R2-Digits,3,Sat May 9 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"Straw manning implies I'm the one creating their argument, purposely making it as flawed and ridiculous as possible.  These are literal quotes from the book. They aren't being mischaracterized or made up here. This book is honest-to-god required reading on college campuses."
SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,R2-Digits,3,Sat May 9 23:40:12 2015 UTC,Straw manning implies I'm the one creating their argument   No it doesnt. A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on false representation of an opponent's argument.
SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,R2-Digits,2,Sun May 10 02:02:12 2015 UTC,You are mischaracterizing the statements from the book which are taken out of context to justify the reasoning of a group that didn't exist when the book was being written.  You do know w.e. b. Dubois is black right?
SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,R2-Digits,2,Sat May 9 23:45:57 2015 UTC,"And what does his race have to do with anything?  And please explain what great context I'm removing from the book. Because an entire paragraph saying ""Truth and Merit are lies"", a separate question saying Capitalism is ""just a story"", and the entire definition of ""Double Consciousness"" in the Glossary of Terms are up there.  You can't just say ""there's no context to those statements, you're mischaracterizing them"" when they're, for the most part, separate paragraphs (and questions) that have all the context they'll get.  Please, explain what context could be missing from their definition of ""White Privilege"", is there some sentence saying ""I'm totally going to tell you all a joke here"" right before that?  EDIT: There's a big difference between quotes and ""taking out of context"" by the way. To take something out of context would be if someone said ""Two guys walk into a bar, one of them admits 'I like rape'"" and then only taking the last three words of that sentence out to attribute it to someone.  It implies an intent to mislead on the part of the person attributing that quote to someone, it requires a person to deliberately hide the context in order to twist someone's words around. You have to actually provide some evidence that I'm mischaracterizing these quotes, rather than just randomly accusing me of it."
SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,R2-Digits,0,Sun May 10 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"The burden of proof is still on you. Your declaration is that these sentiments are core to the belief of all social justice warriors.  But the statements(or rather paragraphs ) you pull are divorced from the context in which they were written not that there is no context for your declaration.  Just because someone makes an objective observation it does not canonize it as an inalienable truth for those who may share in part of  its sentiment.   By ""their"" I'm not sure if you mean sjws or the author of the book. However being as I am neither I cannot answer for them. Is your argument that  white privelege doesn't exist or that it simply is not what they (sjws) say it is?"
SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,R2-Digits,2,Sun May 10 01:04:14 2015 UTC,"No. No it isn't on me to prove that I'm not mischaracterizing these. You're the one who came in here and accused me of it, the burden of proof is on you.  So, provide evidence of this missing context. If they're divorced from context, clearly you know this book better than I am and you're certainly aware that there's a sentence before this that says ""Everything I say in the following paragraph is a lie"" or some other statement that completely changes the context of what they're saying."
SocialJusticeInAction,357apc,R2-Digits,1 point,Sun May 10 01:27:43 2015 UTC,Now Your mischaracterizing my argument. I just posted a play-by-play breakdown of your analysis of each paragraph and why I think you either mischaracterized straw man-ed or completely just didn't understand the material.   But you still must provide the proof for your sentiments and statements so the burden of proof is still on you

And how it not only seems to never end but seems to get worse with each passing week.  Case in point this little sample courtesy of author Josephine Livingston:   Why, then, do people (men) behave at readings in a way that would cause them to get kicked out of my class? Why are grown adults (men) so keen to speak, when they have not in fact done their homework? Why do these greying men put up their hands, and why do they always get called on, when nine times out of ten they can be relied upon not to have read the book or even admit that there’s anything they don’t already know about? Finally—and most outrageously— why are neither they nor the moderators who default to them the slightest bit embarrassed that this is happening?  This, then, must be the real demand of those who moderate readings: fire the moderators. Stop asking famous men to host your book launch on the vague assumption that they’ll draw a crowd. They’re just going to distract from your work, talk about themselves, and then mess up your Q&A. Resist the institutional inertia that heaves you in this direction! Instead, ask somebody who has managed a group of people directly within recent memory. Hire a teaching assistant, a kindergarten teacher, an aerobics instructor, a bus driver. Anyone but a semi-famous male author.  If I knew what to suggest I would do something cleverer than heap pity and scorn on the culprits in bars with my friends. Who am I not noticing not being noticed? Who do I fail to hear as I put my grad-schooled, lily-white hand in the air?  One day, perhaps, we all shall be on that slightly raised stage in front of some fixed mics, and frail old men will clamor for our attention and for hardbacked copies of our works. “Hear me now, fuckers?” we’ll shriek at them, feedback ringing through the bookstore aisles. “Do you hear me now?”"
