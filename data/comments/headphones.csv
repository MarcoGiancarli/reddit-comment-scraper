headphones,3e2hu0,ishca,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:12 2015 UTC,"Just got some pre-fazors yesterday. I've only listened to them for a bit, but really like what I hear. Anyone know how the Fostex stacks up to the Alpha Dog?"
headphones,3e2hu0,ColinAllCarz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"They're different. T50RP mids are almost always more forward sounding than TH900 mids, but the TH900 has better/deeper/more textured sub bass than every T50RP mod I've tried. The TH900 is a really capable headphone but its sound signature doesn't really lead you to think that. I compared the Blackwood to the TH900 and preferred the Blackwood in all aspects but bass, though in a warm system, I may have preferred the TH900."
headphones,3e2hu0,ishca,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:53 2015 UTC,Thanks! You and your ZMFs :oP. I really liked my Vibro; I might have to try the Blackwood one of these days.
headphones,3e2hu0,ColinAllCarz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"Do it! They're kind of like a souped up HD600 in closed form. If you're lucky, I think Zach sells B-stock for like $100 more than what I sold those Alpha Dogs for. They may be very slightly redundant with the LCD2 though because they're both on the slightly warmer side. Though people have compared the Blackwood to the LCD-X."

headphones,3e2hu0,spacelaserstingyeyes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:57 2015 UTC,The T50RP isn't what I'd call unsuccessful. They were meant to be studio headphones and with their mid-forward stock sound they're pretty good for tracking.
headphones,3e2hu0,keanex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm for tracking it might not be unsuccesful, but for something to require a mod, to be pleasant to listen to, is not successful in my eyes. That's my opinion though."
headphones,3e2hu0,keanex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"To me the TH900 was supremely dissapointing. I think they are the best looking headphones I have seen, but I think sound wise I couldn't justify half what they cost."

Anyways, I find that they're definitely v-shaped, recessed mids, highs extending well, and bass going very very low (so low that it distorted on Phaeleh's ""Pulse"" .flac). I have never heard bass like this, it's incredible for hiphop and DnB - saved me from buying an Audeze LCD2 - and I love it.   I feel that they're detailed (not like T90 though).The highs aren't bright (but I guess this very much depends on what you're used too), at least not Beyer bright.  The mids are recessed, almost as much as my COP's, but it gets easier to notice with these due to the large soundstage."

Also, I loathe people who overcharge for international shipping. I do $10 anywhere in the world if you're willing to be patient. Never lost a package. So 'STRAYA or not, you're good with me!

You can literally go buy a Knowles GK and put it into a shell and solder two wires and you have a world class triple.   Sure, but I still don't know how to do it and don't know if what I can find on google is correct. The main barrier for me personally is knowledge. I can go to diyaudio and browse around, but that doesn't help when the last time I looked at any of this stuff was in high school. It definitely wasn't in the context of audio then either.   If I started stocking the armatures would that make your life easier?   I want to say yes, but I feel like once people understand what they are working with, they will go to the cheapest source. So supposing you were to stock the armatures, if I'm confident enough to purchase them, I'm confident enough to look for the place with the lowest mark up."

You can put it one part (I.e. a motherboard) and then it filters out all parts that can't be used by the chosen part. I have no idea how IEMs are made so I figure maybe that would help (or a guided step by step guide to picking every part!)    Guides on how these work. You'll need two in my opinion. You'll need long videos to describe how these work and what parts are important and such. Then you'll need concise videos on how to build different types of IEMs

headphones,3e2mh7,impossiblebottle,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:18:29 2015 UTC,I reviewed the wireless version a while back on my YouTube channel. These are fun to listen to! At this price it's almost tempting to get this version too :)

headphones,3e26gw,rtaylor76,13,Tue Jul 21 11:28:26 2015 UTC,"Technically, neither. The website shows the Chinese name, 飞傲, which would be pronounced (roughly) ""FAYE-ow"". ""FEE-oh"" does sound closer to the Chinese words though."
headphones,3e26gw,echo_nove,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:12:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  It now makes more sense. Not only about it being a phonetic spelling of their Chinese name, but if it was spelled Fio, it would be pronounced ""FY-oh"". However, with the two ii's, it makes it ""FEE-oh"", at least in our American pronunciation of it."
headphones,3e26gw,QuipA,-5,Tue Jul 21 16:04:07 2015 UTC,"Google translate is not a great help here...it translates 飞傲 as ""Faets"", but IIRC Lachlan said in a video it can be translated as ""I believe I can fly"" or something in that direction.  *edit: apparently you seem to disagree. Since there is no English Wiki Page, I checked the German one and it states:   Der Name 飞傲 bedeutet „Stolzes Fliegen“.   Which translates to ""flying proudly"", so maybe that's an indicator :P"
headphones,3e26gw,echo_nove,6,Tue Jul 21 12:25:09 2015 UTC,It's a name. I wouldn't expect a translation software (which seems to assume it is a single phrase or word you can find in a dictionary) to be very useful at all.
headphones,3e26gw,Chemicalzz,4,Tue Jul 21 12:40:26 2015 UTC,Pronounce it like a Japanese man FEE-HO!
headphones,3e26gw,Cheenis212,3,Tue Jul 21 11:31:53 2015 UTC,"I was on OP's side until this comment. Now ""Fy-o"" sounds like a Chinese man who can't find his extinguisher."
headphones,3e26gw,BobbyD84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:54 2015 UTC,Fee-o
headphones,3e26gw,HalalCadmium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:47 2015 UTC,I go with Fee-o to make it consistent with the Nintendo Wii.
headphones,3e26gw,Jerg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:21 2015 UTC,Fee-oh. It's a phonetic adaptation of the company's Chinese name.
headphones,3e26gw,jack-dawed,0,Tue Jul 21 13:40:02 2015 UTC,The first Chinese character means flying and it's pronounced like fei. Like the shoe company feiyue. I pronounce it fai o because I think it's closer to the original pronunciation.
headphones,3e40dz,ArmAvet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:26 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the headphones.  Generally speaking, you can get much better isolation with in-ears, but there are some over-ears that are very good too.    For public transport and stuff, I'd recommend IEM's simply because they're less conspicuous and you could be wearing a $1000 set and most people wouldn't know.  The added isolation is a bonus."
headphones,3e3zpd,Sonicboom4321,2,Tue Jul 21 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"Cable not plugged in all the way.  Sound card level needs to be adjusted from where it was on the old headset.  Doesn't like the USB port it's in.  Drivers.  Mic not close enough to mouth.  Mic too close to mouth.  Finally, it's possible your friends are dicks."
headphones,3e3zpd,lpmiller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'll try the things you suggested hopefully they work, and i also think they might be over exaggerating"
headphones,3e3zpd,slowsound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:13 2015 UTC,Record both and decide for yourself.
headphones,3e1dts,thesheik137,2,Tue Jul 21 05:18:55 2015 UTC,Impressions?
headphones,3e1dts,AceofJoker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:57 2015 UTC,Not OP but since my Noble 5 couldn't really fit my ears I've been forced to go back to these and they're not a complete disappointment. Their upper midrange is a bit hyped up and bass could use some tightening but for free they're the best value ever.
headphones,3e1dts,ishca,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:14:59 2015 UTC,"Sorta like a GR07. However, possibly the best free iem giveaway in the history of iems."
headphones,3e1dts,darkdoorway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"They indeed have the GR07 drivers in a GR06 shell. I like my pair quite a bit, the cable is not the greatest though and they have a very strong panning between L-R going on.  I love the rotatable nozzle and their small form factor! Using them with the medium Olive tips gets me a very good seal and impressive isolation."
headphones,3e1dts,QuipA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:54 2015 UTC,What free item?  How?
headphones,3e1dts,asianfromamerica,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:03 2015 UTC,Lend Me UR Ears had a promotion where you preorder the VSonic VSD2 or VSD2S (~$40)and get a pair of AN16 for free.
headphones,3e1dts,clee290,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:47 2015 UTC,And the AN16s were made specifically for this giveaway to celebrate vsonics 16th anniversary. Double 8. Double lucky.
headphones,3e1dts,darkdoorway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"Only got them yesterday (for $50, not free). My very initial impressions of the sound would be that they sound really chunky. I felt like the upper mids and upper highs were kind of cut out. The bass/low mids were really chocolatey and thick, but not in a bad way.   I read on head fi that the two ports on them are completely sealed,  unlike the gr07 which has two open ports. So I decided to go for it and opened up the front port, which is supposed to bring greater mid/highs presence. It worked like a charm,  the thick bass is there but highs are much more visible now. I'm thinking about opening the rear port as well, to see if they'll sound more open but don't want the bass becoming too boomy."
headphones,3e1dts,fudge_u,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"These are all I use now.  I only purchased the VSD2 IEMs just to get the AN16.  Sold the VSD2 sealed in the box, and ended up only paying $5 for the AN16.  I find they sound better and are more comfortable than my GR07 Classic IEMs.    The foam tips on the AN16 are the best foam tips I've used to date.  I'm not sure if they're Comply tips, because they seem more durable.  My Comply tips would have dried up and cracked by now."
headphones,3e1dts,extralegal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:10 2015 UTC,"I have been using my AN16's for a couple months now.  3 hours commuting daily + few hours of office time each day.  Pretty happy with them for the price.  The VSD2S aren't even getting used.. the cable wasnt really built all that well on them.  The AN16 was fine.  I don't like them as much as my original RE0's back in the day, but after somehow losing my recent set of RE400's they are definitely easier to swallow with the abuse they take.  Best tips so far has been legit sony hybrids from japan with the foam inside the tip and around the nozzle.  Comply's messed with the sound too much in a negative way imo."
headphones,3e1dts,extralegal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:35 2015 UTC,"I'm using the hybrid tips as well,  great fit.  Do you use the ear guides at all? I'm having trouble getting used to them and they usually fall out without them if I try to wear it over the ear."
