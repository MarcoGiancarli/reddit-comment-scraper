fifthworldproblems,3de969,aozeba,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:11:56 2015 UTC,A grinding sound like rock grating against meat. It also seems to generate a smell like burning rubber.
fifthworldproblems,3de969,aozeba,2,Thu Jul 16 07:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Its gonna sound crazy, but have you tried compressing it? Wrap any appendages you have around it and just squeeze. It works sometimes, although occasionally the problem gets worse before it gets better."
fifthworldproblems,3de969,GuesssWho9,2,Thu Jul 16 07:27:24 2015 UTC,Done. Now it seems to be absorbing any matter which comes within a few meters of it and giving off a great deal of heat and gamma rays.

fifthworldproblems,3dewqj,SmashingSenpai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:38 2015 UTC,This almost sounds like a question that you'd ask about Swarm Simulator

fifthworldproblems,3dewqj,RedTheSnapper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"I apologize. I've spent a lot of time around denizens of the 1000th world, where such game is used as a training simulation."

Now re-wrap each piece in the accompanying M√∂ebius crust, and reinsert in the toaster. The inner sections of the bread will become infinitely charred, but you'll have a factory-fresh crust because the toast-engine can't apply a proper heating algorithm.  This will nullify your firmware"
fifthworldproblems,3dalkz,Garrand,5,Tue Jul 14 20:04:07 2015 UTC,Can you sue a pastor? Doesn't the constitutional separation of church and reality prevent that?
fifthworldproblems,3dalkz,LadyDeathMasque,3,Tue Jul 14 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"Do not sue. Instead, consult your pastor inform him the current happenings and take his advice. If nothing works, annihilate him into the abyss because It's fun."
fifthworldproblems,3dalkz,1479852639902834,2,Tue Jul 14 23:51:59 2015 UTC,Don't sue. rue!
