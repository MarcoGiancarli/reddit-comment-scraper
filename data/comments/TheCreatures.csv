TheCreatures,3e2zl1,ForTheGroup,12,Tue Jul 21 15:47:08 2015 UTC,I remember that at this point I still thought that Gassy and Nova were black and this series cemented it in my mind. I remember how special it was to find pictures of each of The Creatures' faces...
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,HellbenderXG,13,Tue Jul 21 18:45:33 2015 UTC,Honestly any content with Lyle is amazing. It's a shame I can't tune into his streams often as he doesn't upload as often
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,Liam4242,11,Tue Jul 21 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"I enjoy Lyle's style of humor, though it's probably offensive for most people. Hell, this is his channel description   Description  I make unoffensive videos for Christian families.  I've also got remarkably cleanly testicles. Just throwing that out there."
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,GLMALT,9,Tue Jul 21 17:40:39 2015 UTC,Probably some of my favorite videos ever. Man what I'd give to see The Creatures of today do something like this again...
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,ApexNegatory,12,Tue Jul 21 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"They've really toned down the type of content they put out, including toning down Dex. I just wish there was some sort of party gaming video once a week where they would just go a bit ""uncensored."""
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,GLMALT,10,Tue Jul 21 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"The tumblr fans would have a hernia. I saw a master post recently where someone complained that James said ""derpy/derp"" like two years ago. They claimed it was ""ablest"" and offensive. As cool as it would be, it'll never happen."
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,HellbenderXG,5,Tue Jul 21 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"This is sadly very true. I really hate that tumblr/people who get offended over the dumbest shit are the voice of reason within the fanbase. I remember them joking years ago about having to make a formal apology for doing something and how it would never happen, and not a year later a bunch of idiots made them do just that over the movie night. (Which I can't remember the name of for some reason.) It was honestly really sad. The second they pulled the video down and apologized they gave all of the hypersensitive fans the power to change them. I just wish I could tell them ""You've gotta stick to your guns! Be you!""   I still have faith that The Creatures can change back... I just hope it's not wishful thinking at this point."

To imagine a person sitting in front of their computer watching a Creature video, and when at some point they hear the word ""bitch"" of all things they get HURT?!?

TheCreatures,3e2zl1,GLMALT,2,Tue Jul 21 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking that same thing for years now! It could definitely be a once a week thing, where they just take off their masks and act authentic and uncensored like the old days. They're definitely capable. As much as they want us to believe they've changed, they really haven't. They've changed the way they act on camera sure, but I'm sure off camera everything is different."
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,ApexNegatory,0,Tue Jul 21 19:39:55 2015 UTC,"You don't know what your asking for. The reason they had to change their act was to calm the offended people. They chose that audience to entertain. And disappointingly, anyone that joins them must change on camera as well (Dexter). If they 'showed their true colors' once a week they might as well do it everyday. But they won't. They've made that clear. Deal with it."
TheCreatures,3e2zl1,MikeHawkIsSmooth,0,Tue Jul 21 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"Damn man... Looks like you deal in harsh truths. I get it, though. The once a week thing would totally ruin the facade they've built themselves. But like I said in my other post, maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part. And yeah that kinda upset me. They totally brainwashed Dex and turned him into something he isn't. I remember when he first joined I was really hoping he would be the change we needed in The Creatures. At least he sees through the bullshit, though."

I loved them at first, but at this point what interesting things is going to happen? He gets a knife and flips out? Already happened 3 times. Gets absolutely nothing in his cases and acts over-the-top angry? Happens every other video. While I kinda wish he would just drop the case openings as a whole it probably wouldn't be in his best interest because of how many views they get, but he should at least take a page out of Alek's book and implement some gameplay or something into the videos to make them more creative and interesting.   Whatever, sorry for the mini rant. If you enjoy the case openings still that's fine and understandable, but is anyone else in the same boat as me?"
TheCreatures,3dyj6a,A1var3z7,5,Mon Jul 20 21:38:19 2015 UTC,Thank you! I made a post a couple of weeks ago about this and people actually agreed with me. Here's a screenshot made by a user a couple of weeks ago on Aleks' channel: https://i.imgur.com/m4EtdJj.png CS content in general is so fucking boring and saturated and I'm LEM and have 600 hours in it...
TheCreatures,3dyj6a,fader910,3,Mon Jul 20 22:16:03 2015 UTC,"Alek's story is a whole other situation. The amount of CSGO vids he puts out is absurd. I enjoy CSGO too, but like you, it gets extremely boring and repetitive to watch after months of basically just CSGO content."
TheCreatures,3dyj6a,A1var3z7,0,Tue Jul 21 00:16:31 2015 UTC,I know that it is. But it's an addiction. I can't stop watching and he can't stop oppening them. At least it's not just one type of case.
TheCreatures,3dyj6a,SoftwareShogun,0,Mon Jul 20 21:44:47 2015 UTC,I agree that he is doing it too much but I am more concerned about how much he spends. The amount he buys and at the rate he does I'm afraid he is gonna quickly run out of cash.
TheCreatures,3dyj6a,A1var3z7,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:59 2015 UTC,He's definitely making back more money from the videos than he spends. I highly doubt he is actually obsessed or even really enjoys opening cases. It's just a type of video that gets a lot of views.

There's just so much hate going on there that I doubt anything good can come out of it. At least on this subreddit, there's (some) constructive criticism going around. I think that limiting it to moderated communities is the way to go.

TheCreatures,3duwhz,ExclusiveAnal,16,Sun Jul 19 18:46:26 2015 UTC,"I like their gameplay and the way it's done, one guy playing, not overreacting , and two or three guys in the back cracking jokes.  I like their openhaus videos where they read their comments for 10+ minutes at a time, rather than the very short segment of the QA in the hub.   Diversity in gaming, they play all kind of stuff, with demo disk for example, often in the same video.   They don't censor themselves, they don't stop talking or just overreact every time someone says something incredibly stupid or dark jokes, it's just part of the shtick with them. The creatures humor is relatively ""kid friendly"",I feel like the funhaus humor, while also not very mature, is closer to what I like.   I like the way they do their FAQ segment, with some gameplay going on while they talk about a topic for an hour or more. The gaming industry discussion with the Creatures is really limited, they often just mention the topic without going in depth and when they do they often seems confused about what they're saying.   And I just love that I don't have to lower the volume because of non stop yelling at time to be honest. It's a bit more chill."

The creatures and Funhaus are completely different, the creatures are targeting younger viewers while funhaus is targeting older viewers. They have two different styles of comedy.   The creatures viewers mature, but the creatures themselves don't (in their videos), so as people get older they get tired of their ""anitcs"" and move on to channels that are for a more mature audience."

But honestly, if the Creatures were smoking weed and were comfortable talking about it, then they would have said so already.

TheCreatures,3droek,TheCasualSpider,0,Sun Jul 19 12:48:45 2015 UTC,what's your point?
TheCreatures,3droek,capri-songoku,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:27:38 2015 UTC,So it's equally intern and creature. How is that too much
TheCreatures,3droek,TheCasualSpider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:50:16 2015 UTC,There should be no interns in content at all. Like before. Or am i being nostalgic?
TheCreatures,3droek,capri-songoku,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:19:12 2015 UTC,Dude who cares it's a podcast.   Edit: you're essentially skipping content because of two interns are involved. Is it really worth it to miss out on potential hilarity because of something as petty as that?
TheCreatures,3droek,TheCasualSpider,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:42:17 2015 UTC,4 creatures if you want to be pedantic.
TheCreatures,3droek,20quid,-2,Mon Jul 20 09:34:02 2015 UTC,"Really, all I see is four creatures."

Then there's 2 random guys who got hired to work in a company. Interns aren't creatures. I didn't sub to watch them! They should be working in the shadows, editing, managing social media and all that, and maybe sometimes be a little bit in some content. If you don't understand my point then there's no use talking anymore."
TheCreatures,3droek,capri-songoku,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:17:11 2015 UTC,Straight from the horses mouth regarding my previous response:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/364spn/what_is_the_gap_between_being_a_creature_and_an/crb8svw  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/3blxf7/whats_the_deal_with_this_sub_and_the_interns/csntdzj
TheCreatures,3droek,20quid,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"Who said anything about it being a title to knight people with? Im just referring to them as creatures vs interns for identification purposes. Even though they see everyone as creatures, my point remains. The interns aren't entertaining. I don't have a say in their editorial direction obviously, neither am i trying to change that direction. I'm voicing my opinion. I've been a die hard fan for a couple years now and I find myself watching less and less of their content (when there even is content) because its boring.  You stated that everyone in the organisation is a Creature, and that makes sense because everyone plays an important role and obviously we are all grateful for all the work they put in, even the interns. They just shouldn't be in this much content. It's just not entertaining to see Joe screaming bullshit, Spencer lying on the floor pretending he's hurt or Aron just being there with a plain look on his face all the time. They aren't cut out to be entertainers and their interactions seem dumb and way too try-hard. And this is okay! No problem at all! Just have them working in the background like it was originally supposed to be. However, as you said this is not the direction they are taking. Quite frankly, no one here seems to have a clue about whatever direction this is.To me it seems that it's straight down, unfortunately."
TheCreatures,3droek,capri-songoku,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"The Creatures themselves have said that they now see ""The Creatures"" as the organisation rather than a title to knight people with. If employees of the company are part of the organisation then they are part of the Creatures and by the very definition set by the Creatures they are Creatures themselves.  You may wish to pick and choose who you watch, and guess what you can, but you don't have a say in the editorial direction taken by the Creatures. They have decided to go in this direction and fans should respect that rather than telling them what they ""should"" and ""should"" not do."

TheCreatures,3do2dg,CreBot,30,Fri Jul 17 21:07:06 2015 UTC,Jordan using a performance enhancing drug.... This explains his behavior in case unboxings; must be a side effect.
TheCreatures,3do2dg,MCTheLazeboy,14,Fri Jul 17 21:44:36 2015 UTC,Didn't Jordan shoot with a bow in one of the old drug bunny bust videos? He was guarding his bush named Petunia if I remember correctly
TheCreatures,3do2dg,riki2cool,12,Fri Jul 17 22:15:19 2015 UTC,Sadly Petunia remains in the hallowed backyard of the original Creature house.

TheCreatures,3do2dg,randomstupidaccount,3,Sat Jul 18 03:24:35 2015 UTC,Well I guess we're in the clear.   For now...
TheCreatures,3do2dg,TheCasualSpider,9,Sat Jul 18 03:47:42 2015 UTC,"Jordan seems to take archery really serious. And from previous videos, moving Koots, there is discussion about him being, at one time, pretty elite. He has some pretty tight groupings that would make me think that is the case."
TheCreatures,3do2dg,FaceofStamos,5,Sat Jul 18 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"He was at one point number 3 in his country, i'm not sure if it was when he lived overseas or the US, i'm assuming it was when he lived overseas.

TheCreatures,3do2dg,Vin_Vin_Vin_Vin,2,Sat Jul 18 15:02:03 2015 UTC,Yeah might be when he lived in Scotland. Wasn't he a state champion at some point as well ? I think I remember that from a video.
TheCreatures,3do2dg,MadlibVillainy,2,Sat Jul 18 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah i think it was mentioned on CT at some point? I dunno. But koots is a kick ass archer, case closed."
TheCreatures,3do2dg,Vin_Vin_Vin_Vin,-3,Sat Jul 18 20:43:06 2015 UTC,Yeah but to be fair archery isn't that common a sport for people to play competitively. Anyone can be the top anything at anything so long as they find a niche sport. Not to downplay his efforts though.
TheCreatures,3do2dg,20quid,-12,Sat Jul 18 22:52:57 2015 UTC,Watched it. Stopped halfway. Just. No.

TheCreatures,3dnn7s,Zankman,8,Sat Jul 18 01:13:45 2015 UTC,"It's perfectly fine to have your opinion, I think you were just down voted for the use of ""shallow"" and ""lackluster"" which sometimes can have a sort of malicious tone behind it.

I see why TB would dislike James at his worst - like during Happy Wheels, I dislike that Nova too - but at his core James is very intelligent, knowledgeable about general gaming, along with things like movies.   The way James is on Creature Talk is, IMO, completely appropriate for the Co-op Podcast.  Also, that was a while ago. Sly is far ""worse"" then James, to boot."
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,Zankman,2,Fri Jul 17 21:05:21 2015 UTC,Sly used to be my favorite creature </3
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,ghostraded,5,Fri Jul 17 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"It's because Tb only knows Nova because of his popularity with happy wheels and starting the whole playing scary games scene. They came up in popularity around the same time, so being as drastically different content and personality wise as they are, there's always been a bit of a rift. The whole machinima vs game station debacle of the early days also created a rift between youtube gamers and shutout a lot of potential friendships.  People found their niche and people just settled with who they knew. Now that the creatures are pretty done with machinima and game stations is dead they've been slowly bleeding into one another.   James on the coop podcast would be awesome, but I would offer my firstborn to see them do a wwe podcast together."
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,K1ngR00ster,8,Fri Jul 17 21:32:33 2015 UTC,I think it was less 'trashing' or dislike and more just him disliking a video he made.
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,ghostraded,3,Fri Jul 17 21:08:57 2015 UTC,Link?
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,khdbdcm,14,Fri Jul 17 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/yKwBdKtWSkA?t=3m11s @3:11 for mobile  It wasn't really as harsh as it would seem from the comment, it was put away by Sly pretty quickly."
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,MadeOfBread,2,Fri Jul 17 21:05:10 2015 UTC,TB kind of bothered me when he sprung that up on Sly.  Do you know if the others agreed with TB? Because I thought that Jesse and James got along (they'd been in a couple of Polaris stuff in the past and they seemed to get along fine)
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,WellLookAtZat,5,Sun Jul 19 23:53:05 2015 UTC,"TB usually uses James as one of his examples of terrible gaming youtubers, his examples are like always Pewdiepie, Tobuscus and James."
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,Zetche,2,Sat Jul 18 12:51:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, as a YouTuber, Nova really is like that.  However, James, the person, as seen on CT, is great."
TheCreatures,3dnn7s,Zankman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:44:32 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure tb really only dislikes this kind of content. Its 0% personal. And the podcast is based on personalities. I would love some of the creatures there ;3

As for the Seamoose i'm really thinking he's not gonna throw away everything he's worked so hard for, he's just taking a break that he needs. With the way people treat Seamus i don't blame him one bit. One day he will come back, yes! he will come back! so to answer your question yes their offices may be a bit dusty, but one day they'll be back to brush it off."

TheCreatures,3dqg99,Alaehan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:33:43 2015 UTC,Yeah it's getting close to a year since non-backlogged content. Even though most of his content is backlogged.

TheCreatures,3dqg99,deepmoss,11,Sat Jul 18 16:17:02 2015 UTC,Aron doesn't use Seamus's office.  Seamus's office is the office after Aron's.

TheCreatures,3dl2g6,Juventus_1897,66,Fri Jul 17 03:27:17 2015 UTC,"Q&A starts at 4:50:30.  I'll try to write some of them down before heading off to bed. Apologies if it isn't verbatim.  Edit: Question 40 starts at 5:30:00 if anyone wants to keep transcribing. I don't think I can write/watch 4 more hours of this.    Question 1: Is it expensive living in Colorado?   Absolutely. If Aron wasn't my roommate then it'd be much more expensive cause we have a 1,100-1,400 sq ft apartment. He pays half the rent and I pay half the rent so it's... I don't know I don't want to get into numbers.   Question 2: Why doesn't Aron drive you places?   Because his car was totaled in the car accident when we were on our way to get breakfast. We used to drive places and then I was hospitalized because I was on the impact side when we got t-boned. I was the only one injured and I should have died but the car died and that's what matters. (He says while smiling)  So that is why Aron does not drive me around places because we do not have a car and he and I are not well off enough to just straight up buy another car. Especially with the $55,000 in medical bills that I still need to pay off and we're still waiting on settlement checks.    Question 3: Do you like rooming with Aron?   We both keep to ourselves... gets interrupted by someone in Skype.   Question 4: How's your forehead scar?   Pretty good I've been putting witch hazel(?) on it and not much has changed. I've been also using lemon juice before that but I ran out of lemons... to juice.   Question 5: What's your favorite candy?   I don't really like candy too much... Starts thinking about his favorite Asian candy... gets interrupted once again...   Question 6: What's your favorite Pocky?   I like the strawberry Pockies a lot... They're really good.   Question 7: What race are you Kevin?   I'm uhh... I can't think of words today. Oh yeah I'm grand prix that's the word...   Question 8: What type of music do you like?   (Indie rock plays in the background.) Well you tell me you're listening to it with me.    Question 9: Does Hox do annoying cat things?   Nope... Actually he scratches the carpet a lot and he pulls up the corners and it's really annoying.   Question 10: Anon comments: I have scars all over my face from a dog accident when I was 6. I know that feel of hating scars too Kevin.   Yeah Anon... it's like that feeling that you know the scars don't mean that much but even if they're little or just small they matter a lot to you just because you know they weren't there before. You know what you looked like before. You were happier with how you looked before than how you look now. I don't know that's how I feel when I look at my scars I'm just like ""Fuck! I miss not having scars in these places."" (He says while laughing.)  When I was hospitalized I wasn't able to work out or anything for a few months afterwards so my tiny-ass twig muscles shrank... and I have cellulite on my arms a little bit right above my armpit.   Question 11: What's your favorite book?   I like ""The Drowning People"" by Richard Mason   Question 12: Kevin would you still name your first son Aleks?   No I would not name my first son Aleks.   Question 13: What's your next tattoo?   I don't know. I have no idea yet.   Question 14:  Washington State or Colorado?   Washington, by far. I like Seattle. I like Colorado's weather... actually that's a lie ever since I moved here... I moved here for four months of snow, followed by a day of sun, followed by four more months of rain. There's shit tons of thunderstorms here and yeah...   Question 15: Kevin do you play Bloodborne?   No.   Question 16: Are you going to PAX (Prime) in Seattle?   I may... I was accepted for media so I'll probably end up going up there.   Question 17: Did you read the letter we poured our precious thoughts in my good sir Kevin?   I did. I did read your letters.   Question 18: Favorite hobby besides video games?   Cooking I guess. I don't really do anything else... I like watching anime... Favorite thing to do offline... I don't know I like the outdoors but I don't have any friends here to go out with (He says with a confused expression)... I like city scenes I like nature I like the outside and all that shit.   Question 19: How was your high school experience?   To sum it up... interesting.   Question 20: Do you care about your health and your eyes?   I do care about my physical health and stuff. I exploit my metabolism a lot so that's why I... I crave bacon so I cook and eat a pound of bacon.   Question 21: Have you seen the Suicide Squad movie trailer?   I have it's pretty good. I enjoyed it. I really didn't like Jared Leto as the Joker... I thinks it's just cause like the Joker shouldn't have that short of hair or a grill. I don't know why he has a grill...   Question 22: Do you ever eat Doritos?   No I don't eat Doritos, period.   Question 23: Ever think you'll get back into writing?   I've been trying. I'd like to. However, if I don't feel good writing because I like... it's weird I feel like I'm not being as productive as I could be because I don't really thinks it's going to be published or it's not really going to help anybody.   Question 24: What kind of Asian are you?   I'm not going to give that information out.   Question 25: How's your life so far and what would you change?   I would change a lot of things I think... I think I'd change not a lot of things actually. I just want to deal with things as they are I guess. Things happen the way things happen and that just the way it is. It didn't happen any other way. So it's not about ""What would you change if you could?""   Question 26: Where did you grow up?   I grew up in Seattle, Washington.   Question 27: Kevin why do you seem depressed?   Because I was diagnosed as depressed and I try not to let that affect what I do because I enjoy what I do and I genuinely love doing what I do and I love helping you and I love being able to live to help all of you and I love building relationships with all of you.  Depression is not a matter of being happy it's a matter of just the way you think. It's just the way you think it's just a mindset... It's not sadness and it's not how to be sad or what's making me sad or anything. Nothing is making me sad it's just my mind sickness kind of thing. I just feel tired.   Question 28: Are you home sick?   No, not anymore.   Question 29: Regardless of whether it helps other people, does writing help you? Emotionally or psychologically?   No, it doesn't really... It's a good way to keep track of things...   Question 30: What's the top quality to look for in a friend?   I don't look for qualities in a friend. I haven't tried to go searching for friends so I don't look for qualities in people I just kind of take people for as they are and judge them accordingly or treat them accordingly.    Question 31: Do you have a loved one or a girlfriend?   No I am single. I'm single but I'm not looking to date though. I just want to focus on myself.   Question 32: How to avoid procrastinating?   Procrastinating is like the worst thing you can do because it's so easy to get distracted and do something else that's less unfavorable than... yeah.   Question 33: Do you have a PO box we can send things to?   No I don't have a P.O. box you can send things to me.   Question 34: What are you?   I'm half-Asian and half-White   Question 35: What's your favorite anime at the moment?   Katanagatari at the moment.   Question 36: What do you want to be remembered for?   I don't really care if I'm remembered. I think for the most part I want to help other people reach their goals I guess. Help other people out who have not been as fortunate as I've been. I'm here to be remembered as a Youtuber to some extent. I don't know maybe I'll live on through other people...   Question 37: Are you fully recovered from the crash?   I'm not allowed to talk about my recovery until the settlements are all done. Legally I'm not allowed to talk about my recovery yet.   Question 38: Have ever had a first kiss?   Yes.   Question 39: What gets you out of the bed in the morning?   You guys. That's why I try to stream everyday and if I don't stream everyday then I try to plan things for the next stream. I've been really lazy with YouTube a lot. I want to do more with YouTube I don't know why I've been so lazy and unmotivated...   Question 40: What advice do you have for people that don't know what to do in their life?   A lot of people don't do things out of fear that they don't know if they can do it or they feel like they'll get stepped on if they do try it and fail or if they try and succeed. You really have to deal with the fact that you are where you are right now. You have to with that fact that only you are going to change things for you nobody else can change things for you.   They can come in and take you away from your current situation, put you in a home with new people. They can give you new things, they can put you in a place where people will take care of you, but life isn't going to change. You're going to be in a different place with different people but you're not going to change yourself. At that point it's going to take a while. The chances of that happening aren't really there only you are going to change things for you."

I suppose Seamus hasn't been around in a while so I haven't heard how the weather has been but I just find it weird that Seamus had been complaining about it for so long and then Kevin says it rains a lot there."

TheCreatures,3dl2g6,HeyImZachGrump,18,Fri Jul 17 06:45:53 2015 UTC,"He said Yes, but the part that caught everyones attention was ""In the past, they've changed."" Then he said change could be good. But he didnt say what he meant by in the past."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,HeyImZachGrump,19,Fri Jul 17 06:52:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I found that to be a very weird response, especially considering how he still is labelled as a Creature, so it makes me wonder if that means he doesn't really want to affiliate with them anymore, since he also answered the PO Box question very strangely, indicating that, ""he doesn't get stuff from the Creature PO box, that stuff goes to them,"" or something along those lines. I know he's going through a lot and all, but I do feel like these cryptic statements don't help matters much, he should just come out with an official statement about his status with the Creatures, much like I think Seamus should. Just my personal thoughts on everything."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,Exclarius,9,Fri Jul 17 07:01:13 2015 UTC,"The fact that he refers to the Creatures as a separate entity from himself is unsettling, and the fact that him and Aron ""keep to themselves"" as roommates kind of supports this as well. I just don't want there to be any bad blood and I want him to come out with how he really feels about his future with the Creatures moving forward. I think that's reasonable enough."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,michaeltai,6,Fri Jul 17 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't really watched the creatures lately becuase I feel like I've kind of outgrown them, so I don't know whether all what I am going to say is still entirely accurate or even relevant, but I'll give it a go.   Playing videogames is fun, I am pretty sure we can all agree on that. But when you do it day in, day out for your job I don't doubt it starts getting kind of stale after a while. Combine that with not always recording from home where you can do what you want, but in an office where you work with a lot of people you like, maybe some a little less and add a giant audience on top of that: it puts you under a lot of pressure.   Pressure that you didn't have before , maybe because the audience was smaller or maybe because you're more of a person that likes to be alone sometime, but it doesn't really matter because it will change you and how you act to other people. I can only imagine how hard it must've been for for example Dan sometimes when he just made a joke on nova or whoever and then got thousands upon thousands of reactions hating on him, even though if you gave it a little thought you could easily see it was just a joke.   Dealing with so much pressure every day is hard, and as I said it changes you. You may have been friends for years, but in this situation it could take only a small disagreement to damage it.   I don't really know Kevin that well but I think he is like 19 or something? This is definetely not the easiest part of your life and it seems like he's been through a lot already. It must sometimes be terrible to deal with so many things at once.   Of course they know they've got a big part of their audience that loves them for what they do, but the small minority can ruin that, and that sucks. I'm sure they have built some kind of mental shield against this over the years but I really can't see this working all the time, sometimes it must jsutget to you.   Then again I'm not in their situation so I wouldn't exactly know what all goes on behind the scenes, but I can't imagine it all being very easy."

Well Kevins mods are super anal, and ban people for absolutley anything.  As for your question, I believe he has been spending more time streaming as of late to work towards paying off his medical bills. There may be other reasons though."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,BearticBeast,-5,Fri Jul 17 06:03:21 2015 UTC,"That's not true of the mods. They're good people. Kevin gets really tired of being asked the same question of ""blah blah blah Creatures!?"" ""blah blah blah Seamus!?"" and gets mad when he constantly sees these questions. Thus, the mods -99% of the time- only purge those comments so he doesn't see them. They don't ban for a long time unless told to by Kevin or the person keep spamming the question over and over. Also, I think that rule says not to ask about Creatures and direction of content and seamus."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,Ibfinity,3,Fri Jul 17 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"Aha im aware, thats why I stated the rules, which dont state to not anything about him and the creatures, they only state to not ask things that Kevin has no control over.

TheCreatures,3dl2g6,pokemon2471,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"again, people don't get banned right away. They just get purged."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,zdragonkillah,8,Fri Jul 17 20:30:48 2015 UTC,I never knew he was single. I saw it somewhere but never believed it.  Its kind of sad that one day he was dating and now hes just single.
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,HokageEzio,3,Fri Jul 17 21:58:46 2015 UTC,Just tuned in about 15 minutes ago. Cant stop wont stop.
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,colorblindrainbow917,2,Fri Jul 17 12:59:55 2015 UTC,I have a question until I end up watching the VOD.  Are his (physical) injuries healed?
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,soulsyth,2,Fri Jul 17 06:28:14 2015 UTC,Yes. Scars are there though. That's why he hates scars.
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,rewdog22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:56:15 2015 UTC,I think Kevin just solved my motivation problem
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,Bieberkinz,3,Fri Jul 17 05:57:22 2015 UTC,"My heart goes out for him. we all have a story and they all have dark sides. I'm listening to him talk right now and he's been through things. things that honestly had no idea, I doubt anyone has. He talks about his scars and his pain,his families situation. A story that does give tug on your heart and even your soul.Even more being a fan of his for years.  He's 19....my age. That make me feel even more. I had bad,terrible,and dark times ,but not as long as him. Hell, my respect for him has grown greatly. Kevin speaks about his problems with feeling happy, which I know that feeling...very empty.  MR.KEVIN  i put this in the stream chat,but in the case you didn't read it and reading this I have to copy and paste  it here! ""Kevin...hand shake you....I'm must give you a hand shake or a hug. one of the two or both! no just both, damn it! Kevin  i will bend the rules of space and time so i can give you a possibly the most manliest HANDSHAKE the universe can HANDLE!""  GOd DANG IT!  I want that hand shake/Hug of Manly proportions! or just regular proportions ,any kind of handshake/hug!"
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,ZombieWolf2508,2,Fri Jul 17 09:29:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! Just tuned in. Any highlights? He's giving advice about relationships with people right now.
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,naoww,15,Fri Jul 17 05:37:16 2015 UTC,"Kevin dropped out of high school. Didn't know that. Kevin doesn't know how to swim or ride a bike. Kevin and his sister were beat at a young age by their mother, who was a slave in her native country (we don't know the name of the country; Kevin prefers not to tell us). Most of Kevin's mother's family were killed in the past."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,AustinCT,11,Fri Jul 17 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to swim as well, I like that I'm not alone."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,rewdog22,6,Fri Jul 17 05:03:38 2015 UTC,I also sink in water
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,MCTheLazeboy,7,Fri Jul 17 07:00:35 2015 UTC,Country is Cambodia.
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,TacticalBlankie,7,Fri Jul 17 07:23:57 2015 UTC,"Probably Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,CalamityTD,3,Fri Jul 17 10:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm there for all of this too! It's the beginning of the stream I missed. Apparently it was more of a Q&A, this has become a mix of stories and advice. Pretty deep still. Tough guy to make it through his past."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,Jeskid14,2,Fri Jul 17 13:42:50 2015 UTC,I love when chat spammed #WeLoveKevin
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,BearticBeast,3,Fri Jul 17 05:11:02 2015 UTC,"Nice. I can't ride a bike nor swim, as well. :D"
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,BearticBeast,2,Fri Jul 17 05:15:13 2015 UTC,"Well, fuck"
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,xRockyBlurgh,11,Fri Jul 17 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"I erased the personal shit. But it's a livestream... and he's willingly saying this stuff. I'm just sharing for the lazy ppl that don't wanna watch a VoD.  If the mods allow me to include the painful points he stated, I'll put em."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,BearticBeast,2,Fri Jul 17 17:34:05 2015 UTC,Mind Pm'ing me the details? I'm on mobile and can't watch the VOD because it'll probably murder my data   :(
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,KoalaOto,-3,Fri Jul 17 05:07:34 2015 UTC,Ride a bike? Why not?
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,BearticBeast,2,Fri Jul 17 05:13:19 2015 UTC,"He said the reason was that he was afraid of doing it so his dad was like ""okay whatever, you don't have to learn""."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,hitroh,2,Fri Jul 17 06:28:23 2015 UTC,I just joined the chat. Is it still Q n A or just him giving advice?  Either way Im overcome with feels ;_;
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,LilTrins,6,Fri Jul 17 06:10:09 2015 UTC,It's still Q&A but he's answering each question in length :)  I'm in my feels too :(
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,StevenKeen,2,Fri Jul 17 06:11:58 2015 UTC,"Holy moly! That was a great stream!  I dont find myself usually sticking to a lot of these solo streams, especially if there is no game being played, but my gracious, Kevin had me hooked onto everything he said.   Most cases I could just abruptly exit out of the tab, especially considering that I had things I wanted to do, but by Babu if Kevins telling a story those things can wait!"
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,Estonia2012,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"Do you guys think there's gonna be a VoD for this? I want to watch the whole thing, my internet is being stupid right now >.<."
TheCreatures,3dl2g6,KyleRaynerGotSweg,3,Fri Jul 17 04:20:15 2015 UTC,There will be
