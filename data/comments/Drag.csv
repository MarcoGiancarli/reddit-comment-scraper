Drag,3e2d3a,soggy_tampon,6,Tue Jul 21 12:40:01 2015 UTC,Oil Sheen or silicone spray will work wonders. And never brush a wig unless you want it fluffy. Brushing it frays out the fiber and makes a mess of it. Use a wide toothed come or a metal brush specifically for wigs and start from the bottom up. Brush out the tangles at the end first and work your way up gently.
Drag,3e2d3a,dazeymayhem,4,Tue Jul 21 12:58:47 2015 UTC,Steam it! Get a steamer and run it down the fibers with a comb. You'll need a wig head to pin it to.
Drag,3e2d3a,KareemMcJagger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:04 2015 UTC,"Like, I figured out that a cat brush works really good on this wig but it just makes it look really fluffy. I want the red carpet feel."
Drag,3e2d3a,ChristiVanCartier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"You need to restyle the entire thing. that wig has had it. I would Stream it straight. than find some old school curlers. put it on a wig head, pin it in really really good. Roll her up in Curlers doing small small small sections put her in a bag and steam her. about 4 or 5 times.... Let her sit for a day. take the  curlers out one by one, while teasing the base part of the wig. The way you put the curlers in is the direction the hair is going to naturally fall once styled. this is unchangable after you take it out of the curlers. Hope this helps."
Drag,3e2d3a,ChristiVanCartier,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:47:57 2015 UTC,"Important step is steaming it straight or else you're hair will not turn out polished. I normally use Pump it up to stiffen up the base, than use dove hair spray for the enter and center of the wig. Followed with a little oil shhhine for shine. if you want a stiff bang use GOT2B. it comes in a yellow bottle looks like a blow horn."
Drag,3e42w9,goldenharmonica,3,Tue Jul 21 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for how you've been doing it, but if you've just been following makeup tutorials blindly, then that's your problem. You just have to keep doing it to learn your face and pay attention to what you have trouble with and what  you don't. Try diffeerent techniques. Use different brushes. You get the idea.  And I don't know anyone who has put on makeup for the first time to rousing success. So don't worry."
Drag,3e42w9,wrongfrog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:51:09 2015 UTC,Thank you. I haven't really been following them blindly. My biggest problem I think is impatience. I have 15 brushes I will experiment with that. I can do female makeup on others and it looks good but I got nervous doing my own. :(

I would say focus on one step at a time, and practice until you've got it. Like say day one I'm going to work on contouring. And do it a few times until you really got the swing of it. Today I'm going to practice eyes and I'm going to own it."

Drag,3e42w9,ChristiVanCartier,2,Wed Jul 22 02:23:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'm excited to see with what you can produce later on, this was a great attempt on your first try! Lot's of practicing is the best tip I can give you. Some things take a lot of time to get right and it's really about finding with what works best with your features. Makeup tutorials online are a huge advantage us modern queens and it's a privilege to have however they're really just guides and we have to take that guide and work with our own shapes. Eyeliner is a stand alone thing that took me so many tries to even get a decent shape down. For that I recommend beginning with felt tip liners, liquid can get everywhere pretty fast and gels not the easiest to start off with. Invest in lashes and start contouring and highlight soon, it'll really push your look to being more finished. I can't tell from the picture if you used lip liner or not, if not get one it can help a lot with shaping and making them more realistic. Try following your natural lip line next time - most queens extend their lips up and you went very wide with yours, to balance that you have to extend up as well. Good luck :)"

Drag,3dzts4,BijouSinclaire,3,Mon Jul 20 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"How many layers of glue do you typically do? I've settled on three and I have huge brows. I'm not a pro, but I've found that you really have to figure out the direction your hairs grow. You want to sweep the hairs up and out, typically, but even then you really have to see where the hair naturally wants to go and smooth it out that way. As far as the process itself, I usually apply the glue, use a clean mascara brush to brush the hairs back, and then smooth the glue out with my finger once it has started to become slightly sticky.  I've also had issues with the glue clumping up once I apply makeup. I think it has to do with how much glue is accumulating around the eyebrows. You really have to smooth it out. If the edges of the glue are raised and don't sort of blend into the actual skin, that clumping happens to me. I try to remove some of the surrounding glue with tweezers if I feel like the glue is getting messy. If it becomes too sticky and you try to smooth it out, the clumping gets even worse. To hide my brows better, I also apply a little orange before the foundation in order to counteract the blue tones of dark eyebrow hair."
Drag,3dzts4,JordanKunt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the tips!! Very very helpful! I usually apply at LEAST 3 layers, usually around 5 or so most of the time and it has never looked presentable. Your process sounds similar to what I do. I love the idea of using tweezers to remove the clumps of glue if clumping happens. Never thought of that. I guess its just something I have to continuously practice :)"
Drag,3dzts4,dazeymayhem,2,Mon Jul 20 22:00:50 2015 UTC,It sounds like maybe you're not letting the glue get good and dry between layers and before putting the makeup over them.   Make sure each layer is completely dry before you move on. It really sounds like it's not drying and you're using too much. I can get the burliest of eyebrows down with three layers.   And be sure you don't swipe on the makeup over them. Press and pounce it on. If you wipe it on you run the risk of disturbing the glue which will lead to clumping.
Drag,3dzts4,okaywerk,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:43 2015 UTC,"USE PROS AIDE. I have the thickest brows in the whole world, and pros aide is the only thing that covers them. just make sure to get remover too, its a bitch to get off"

Drag,3dzts4,g0dhatesbags,4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:57 2015 UTC,"My brows are suuuuuuper thick and I feel like I tried every trick in the book until I settled on a routine that involves both Pros-Aide cream and glue stick.  I take Pros-Aide cream on my finger, put it on my brows, and smooth it out by pressing and sliding my finger along the grain of my brows. I wait just a couple of minutes, then I go in with a few strokes of glue stick. I wait for about 15 minutes, carefully press in a ton of Ben Nye Super White powder, let it cook for a few minutes, then dust off the excess. I go in one more time with the glue stick, powder again while the glue is wet, and then I'm done.  I did this yesterday and my cover didn't budge for 9 hours (including a performance) in 90 degree weather. It also takes makeup really well."
Drag,3dzts4,okaywerk,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:39 2015 UTC,"i comb through my brows with a spoolie, and then coat the brow in a good amount of pros aide, then brush through them with a spoolie again, and then i flatten it out with my finger. Then i add as many layers of pros aide (without brushing through them) as i feel like i need. Make sure that you have a little bit on your finger at all times though, because going over almost-dry pros aide with a dry finger makes it ball up and weird. Then i just set them with powder and some red concealer, then powder, then skin toned concealer (like you would with the glue stick method)"

Going back several decades, when drag really started to flesh itself out, being openly queer was incredibly fucking dangerous. And so we had to congregate in shitty inner-city neighborhoods and bribe cops to keep them from arresting us. Drag arose as a form of creative expression and entertainment for these communities because they HAD. NOTHING. ELSE.  If we're going to compare drag to something (which it shouldn't be), It's probably closer to rap music than anything else, at least when you think of their similar backgrounds."

We love that you're different, just like us. It's not blackface. You're not making fun of trans people. You're not making fun of cis people. You're just doing you.

Drag,3dwf6q,Pankuro,5,Mon Jul 20 05:24:48 2015 UTC,Something is off about the eye area. It may be the shape of your crease contrasts with the shape of the brows? Definite improvement though.
Drag,3dwf6q,Pankuro,2,Mon Jul 20 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"I agree, actually! Im trying to figure out how to make it look more correct. Do you think narrower/closer to the eyes?"
Drag,3dwf6q,PMYourBeard,3,Mon Jul 20 07:36:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's more the shape. Your creases are very flat near the nose bridge, but your brows are very angular. Could also be that your creases are drawn too high, because the brows are a good distance from the crease. It could also be the lack of big lashes that throws everything off."
Drag,3dwf6q,mariahspoolboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:58:26 2015 UTC,Probably a bit of both tbh. had a raging lash fail so only put on one set. I'll be sticking with what works next time! Thanks for the advice bby :)
Drag,3dwf6q,whenifeellikeit,3,Mon Jul 20 14:03:59 2015 UTC,"I actually had a similar problem at one time. I think you just need to bring that cut crease up a little bit to meet them eyebrows, and maybe make it a little more arched rather than straight. I have a heavy preference for those deep set Cher eyes though, so just try it out, but it might not be what you like."

Drag,3dxdgg,wrongfrog,3,Mon Jul 20 09:08:24 2015 UTC,Use a finishing spray to clear up the powderyness after you've brushed off your finishing powder.
Drag,3dxdgg,Pankuro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:16:06 2015 UTC,Can you use finishing spray in between steps?
Drag,3dxdgg,WorkDish,3,Mon Jul 20 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"Not recommended, because it's not a great texture top put stuff on top of. Hence being called finishing spray haha."
Drag,3dxdgg,Pankuro,3,Tue Jul 21 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"To add to the tip about washing your brushes. Baby shampoo is a lot less harsh than soap. Never dunk them or submerge them completely. If you get water up into the ferrule you will end up with them shedding and falling apart.  For the really grubby ones, or just a good deep cleaning, put a little bit (very little, you don't want them greasy) of oil into the bottom of a container (i.e. a bow or mug) and smoosh the brush around. The oil will break down all that built up makeup. Try it, you'll be amazed. I use a drop of olive oil with a drop of patchouli. This gets them really clean and helps recondition them a bit. Wash and rinse as you would normally after you clean them with oil.  Added tip - keep a baby wipe out on your vanity (or whatever) while you're doing your makeup. As you finish with a brush, wipe it on the baby wipe. This helps keep them from getting super dirty super fast."
Drag,3dxdgg,dazeymayhem,4,Mon Jul 20 16:54:26 2015 UTC,I cannot agree with the baby wipe enough
Drag,3dxdgg,Cody_Nova,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:59 2015 UTC,Yes gawd. I go through 3 or 4 just wiping off my brushes!

Although my fancy Kryolan brush never gets as clean as when it was new...  Do y'all put foundation on your actual eye lid? I do but when I go over it with makeup it seems to dull it. Maybe I'm not using about setting powder over it?
Drag,3dxdgg,WorkDish,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"Try a castile soap bar for your brushes.  No, I use an eye primer like a mac paint pot."
Drag,3dxdgg,Pankuro,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:52 2015 UTC,You can use foundation if you make sure it is blended before you apply shadow but I wouldn't recommend it. A primer or shadow base is always better

Drag,3dv675,Cody_Nova,5,Mon Jul 20 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"I agree about Raven. But she is such a fully realised concept - not just 'look at me pretty.'

Drag,3dv675,TheOneDoc,4,Mon Jul 20 20:37:02 2015 UTC,Good point on Raven. Raven's beauty is not merely passable-as-girl pretty. It's a skillfully crafted and distinct look that's anything but basic.

Drag,3dv675,PMYourBeard,6,Mon Jul 20 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"it's fucking stupid to treat ""Drag"" like anything with limits. I know the analogy is tired, but drag, like with all art forms, is not a box. It's more like an ocean; it has a defined structure but is overall still fluid and intersects a lot with other art forms.   Drag used to be local and underground. That, very obviously, is beginning to change (It's still very much a local thing when you get down to it, however). Since it has much more exposure, there's been an influx of people with fresh ideas, and of course a bunch of queens who have been in the game for a lot longer are going to become defensive.  sometimes it's easy to forget that, behind all the makeup and character play, that queens are people too. as such, there's going to be a lot of Bitter Betties and they just gotta get over themselves in the end."
Drag,3dv675,PMYourBeard,2,Mon Jul 20 09:29:18 2015 UTC,Exactly. It's not just old-guard beauty queens that can get wrapped up in a small view of what drag is. Some of the younger fans have a frighteningly narrow view.
Drag,3dv675,dazeymayhem,4,Mon Jul 20 20:23:21 2015 UTC,"Closed minded people exist in every community. It's selfish to think that the way that you do things is the only way to do things.  For me, I like queens who take their drag outside of the box. Tradition can get a little boring :]"
Drag,3dv675,PMYourBeard,3,Mon Jul 20 07:06:42 2015 UTC,"YES! And I'm glad that you, specifically, added to this conversation.  A few years ago, I wasn't sure how to feel about bio-queens. After coming to know a couple, I'm 100% about embracing their drag, and their place in the community.  Somebody can't handle it? That's their problem, and I'm happy to let them keep it."
Drag,3dv675,dazeymayhem,3,Mon Jul 20 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually have a friend who is guilty of the ""that's not drag"" way of thinking, though he's never overtly said it. The first time we went to a show together, we saw a drag king he told me how annoying he thinks they are and I shut that shit down. The king who hosts in my town puts just as much effort and love into his drag as any queen.  But thanks for sticking up for us bio queens. I've read some nasty stuff about us from other redditors, but I know that they don't pay the bills, so I pay them no mind :]  PS, not part of this thread but I really wanted to tell you, I finally performed at my first amateur show. I was sooo nervous - not to perform, but to be accepted by the other queens (I'm an extrovert with social anxiety, go figure). There were some really beautiful girls in the dressing room, and another bio queen who was much more experienced. I went out and performed Short Dick Man and it went really well, the crowd was going crazy when the song was over. I actually ended up winning at the end of the night, which was surprising considering one of the other queens actually did a flying leap into the splits from the stage (I can't even touch my toes). Anyways, I was just so proud to have won my very first performance! And because I won, I get to come back for another show this week :] I'm planning on doing Eartha Kitt's ""I want to be Evil"""
Drag,3dv675,dazeymayhem,4,Mon Jul 20 22:35:42 2015 UTC,"Not to hijack the thread, but congrats, sweetie! I am so thrilled that you went out there and did it! That you won really doesn't surprise me - I had a feeling that once you took the leap, they would accept you with open arms. A well deserved win I am sure.   Be proud!   And ""I wanna be evil"" is easily one of my all time faves! Best of luck. I am sure you will kill it!"

Drag,3dv675,dazeymayhem,4,Tue Jul 21 04:31:27 2015 UTC,"Any time I hear 'that's not drag,' I tend to almost immediately dismiss it. The kind of people that would say this are obviously not educated enough in drag to be speaking about it. Drag is literally everything. It is so all encompassing and inclusive that there's really no such thing as 'not drag' in the drag community.  I think the problem lies in the popularity of a certain game show that has become its own double-edge sword. It brought us - and drag - into the mainstream and made it cool (though I am unsure if that's a good thing or not), but it also created a whole tidal wave of would be experts that haven't the faintest idea who Leigh Bowery or Jackie Curtis are. Their world - and their education - is so limited, and yet they are the first ones proclaiming 'that's not drag.'   It would serve them well to step away from the tv and get off of Instagram et al and actually learn what drag IS, rather than barfing up what it's not just because they don't know what they are talking about. Just because they don't like it doesn't mean it's not. And as cute as they think they are now, come back and talk to us if they're still relevant past the age of 30, or after they've lived a little and learned a thing or twelve.   And - before the shouts of Ageism begin. Put your pitchforks away. It's not age I have a problem with, it's ignorance behind a bullhorn (or a keyboard).  Ask most of the kids on here if I'm ageist. I'm more of everyone's favourite grandma. And grandma's tell you how it is."

If you can't figure out what to do with her start experimenting. Buy some rollers, user her to teach yourself how to use them, experiment with boiling water, your steamer, the microwave, even. Don't throw away your wigs, ever. Figure out what to do with them, because there's always something. I had an unworkable black lace front that I thought I was never going to wear again, and I turned her into this. There's always something.   Follow BobbiePinz on youtube, and dissect every one of their videos. Get yourself some long ass pins, some mesh rollers from Sally Beauty (or any kind of roller, really), just go nuts. Figure out what you want, and then figure out how to get it."

Drag,3duooi,berlin_blume,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"I recommend getting a cheap set of basic rollers (different sizes). A lot of people don't realize this but you can set the hair in the rollers, put a plastic bag over it (on a wig head) and then steam the shit out of it. When it drys your wig will be curly af!"
Drag,3duooi,berlin_blume,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:01:04 2015 UTC,Good idea! I tried steaming the hair while rolled onto my straightener (while off) but that obviously didn't do the trick. It sounds like curlers would be a good investment.
Drag,3duooi,dazeymayhem,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:53:51 2015 UTC,"Well you can do it that way! Basically you just need the form of the roll. The trick is to let it cool and dry....once you have it rolled onto your straightener and steamed, release the straightener and re roll it in your hand, then take a bobby pin or a clip and pin it and let it cool. Once you do that for the entire wig, give it a good hairspray and let the hairspray dry. Once the hair is dry you can let all the curls down :)"
Drag,3duooi,Matthewpp,3,Mon Jul 20 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"Pro-tip. After you've steamed it and are letting it cool down, stick it in the freezer while still in rollers or pins. The sudden change from hot to cold really sets the curl."

If you do want to cover your eyebrows and they're thick I've heard you can use some spirit gum over them after you've gone at them with glue because it covers them better plus it makes the surface smoother to apply makeup to"

Drag,3dpn94,Soldus,3,Sat Jul 18 05:56:57 2015 UTC,"The brows could maybe be a bit darker and/or you could use some concealer so that the brow and shadow don't blend into each other. Otherwise, damn! you're looking good."
Drag,3dpn94,shinyjumpluff,3,Sat Jul 18 07:17:52 2015 UTC,I would say invest in a good lip liner and clean up the edges after application. It looks a little smudged and irregular.
Drag,3dpn94,frau-fremdschamen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"Haha, I was wondering if anyone would notice. I couldn't find my lip liner so I tried to freehand it; you can see how well that turned out."

Drag,3dpn94,DanityFlair,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"Great job, but like the others said, work on the brows. If you're gonna do a librarian look, don't put the eyebrows so high up because that's not realistic.   Make sure that contour is blended a pinch more.   My biggest critique is the shape of the lips. The angle you gave to your top lips almost give you an automatic frown."

I've tried several different brow shapes and I've found that these work for me, I'm just working on tapering them off and having them not look bad right now.  As for the hat it's actually a headscarf, I use those instead of wigs, it's my gig lol."

Drag,3doc83,The-CAL-Collective,3,Fri Jul 17 22:25:43 2015 UTC,"Your eyebrow technique is remarkably good. Honestly, it has the perfect amount of strokes and color.   The only thing I would change is the way you apply your eyeliner. You're putting too much under the outside part of your undereye. It makes it look droppy. Basically, it looks like a lazy eye. You never want to make your undereyes curve. If you plan to apply on the bottom part of your eye, or bottom lashes, make sure to apply the entire way across.   That's just my critique though. I just don't like eyeliner that makes people's eyes look droopy, I guess. Otherwise your makeup looks nice. The brows and lips are great."

Drag,3doc83,SirRifki,4,Sat Jul 18 23:35:32 2015 UTC,"WoW! Work! If I could give a loving suggestion - less under eyeliner. It's a bit too much and it is making your eye look droopy. You don't need to apply much to your under eye. Use a pencil on your waterline and maybe a little shadow underneath, close to the lash line to accentuate. You look gorg so please don't take offense! Good luck babe"

Drag,3dly0b,The-CAL-Collective,2,Fri Jul 17 12:49:02 2015 UTC,Bodycon?
Drag,3dly0b,mgranaa,4,Fri Jul 17 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"""Body conscious"" dresses. Basically just tight dresses (usually in a stretch material) that show off the shape of the body. Every skinny boy that wants to do drag seems to start with one of these dresses, not realizing they make you look like a man in a dress more than most clothes. You really need to cinch and pad to make these look right, or just have a very feminine body shape like Willam or Detox.  An easy way to start is buy a nice dress that you like a fits you well, tailor it as best you can, add some flair, and accessorize it well. Don't worry about spending too much on your costume so soon. Just put some effort into the look and you'll be better off than most starting queens."
