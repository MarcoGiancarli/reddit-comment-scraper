grime,3difcr,pandiculater,2,Thu Jul 16 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"This is the best post so far, should be at the top. Young Man Standing 3 is the one where Wiley and Lethal B clash, but YMS1 has a clash between Essentials and Forcer (if i remember correctly?) and the clash between Napper and Ghetto that's on Lord of the Mics. YMS2 is the one where Trim and Stormin clash and Stormin pulls out a gun.  I was gunna make a post too but I can't really be bothered and this covers a lot I was gunna post anyway. Those Young Man Standing ones are essential tbh"
grime,3difcr,cammyg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"cheers mate! I thought of one more that I love,   God's Gift fucks up everything and Essentials jump in at the end  NASTY & Roll Deep 2003 Sidewinder Bonus Set: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQTLqd7bJy4  I think I've heard all the popular sets that were on grimetapes etc. but if there any under the radar one's you have I'd appreciate the links.  I sometimes wonder what grime would be like if the crews stayed together and they stuck with the CD Packs of sets format. The mixtape era produced some classics but a lot of energy was lost."
grime,3difcr,pandiculater,2,Thu Jul 16 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"I reckon my list of favourites (excluding some of the ones you posted) are:  Dj Cameo, Crazy Tich, Kano, Sharky Major, Esco, Kappo on BBC 1xtra  Roadside Gs on 1xtra  Jammer's Birthday (Mak 10 feat. D Double E, Stormin, Wiley, Dizzee Rascal, Crazy Titch, Kano, Hyper, Esco, XTC, Dangermouse, Armour, Tinchy Stryder, Jammer, Shifty Rydos & Slix) on Deja Vu  DJ Mac 10 with Kano, Sharky Major, Ghetto, Stormin, Armour, Hyper, NJ Fever, Bruiser, Hyperfen and Marciephonix on Deja Vu  DJ Fatal with Crazy Titch & Kidz in da Hood  Wiley vs Frisco on Heat Fm  Roadside Gs & Paid in Full on On Top Fm  17/06/04 - Total Package on Raw Blaze  DJ Karnage & Danny Weed ft/ Discarda, Bubbles, Scratchy, Jamakabi, Jet Le, J2K, Wiley, Breeze, Slix, Crazy Titch & Dizzee Rascal (Crazy Titch & Dizzee Clash, but not the famous fight) on Rinse  Slimzee ft Wiley, Dizzee, Flowdan, Breeze, Jamakabi & God's Gift on Rinse (I always forget about this one, but its fucking sick. Right in the period where garage was becoming grime)  Chronik, Jammer, Tempa T & Gully Ranjah (Slewing Ghetto & Demon) on Rinse Fm  24/04/05 - DJ Tubby feat. Newham Generals on Rinse  24/11/02 - Slimzee feat. Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Durrty Doogz, Dogzilla & Gods Gift on Rinse (this one is truly underrated. Wiley and Dizzee at their best going b2b. They even do each others bars. Then Doogz comes and clashes Wiley)  Wiley Xmas set on Rinse (well known but a classic)  29/01/06 - Newham Generals, Dizzee Rascal & Esco on Rinse  Sidewinder Bonus CD: Slimzee with Wiley & Dizzee  I have almost certainly left others off as well. I was looking and I have around 200 sets on my hardrive. Most of them are from various versions of grimetapes or grimeforum so you may have seen many before. The sets were probably my favourite part of grime tbh, 2002-2006 was like a golden age for me."

grime,3dfxsv,HarryBlessKnapp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:09:40 2015 UTC,"It's a show called Four To The Floor, on Wednesdays at midnight. He was on it the week before performing 1 sec, this week it was a sort of interview setting where he spoke about his music and his upbringing, the weirdness of how extreme his life is going both ways, his mates will be dying on the streets and he's out selling out shows. They even had a phone interview with his mum which was a bit weird, and then he did Ignorant and Wot with a live drummer. Pretty decent viewing, should be on channel 4's website I think. Earl Sweatshirt had a segment that episode too if you listen to him."
