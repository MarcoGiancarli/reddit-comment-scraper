Warhammer,3e4445,Ragemelon,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"I think one of the ""older"" codices need it first, namely CSM/Daemons. If they do not just get spilt up into the Daemonkin forces, that is. After that I know they  just  got a release early last year(?) but DEldar could do with an Update/ errata/ supplement to get them on par with the newest Codices.  Alternatively if SoB werent so niche, they would probably see an update soon. However AFAIK Tau are still considered fairly strong."
Warhammer,3e4445,greypiper1,3,Tue Jul 21 20:37:18 2015 UTC,The only thing that DE need are the return of the weapon and other options that were robbed from us by this edition. Apparently poisoned knives became the rarest weapons in the universe.

Vect disappearing wasn't damaging from a gameplay perspective except for those rare individuals who made custom models for him or countsas, but it was a major ""fuck you"" to folks who diligently supported a fairly minor army. Imagine any Primarch who does not yet have a model and then have someone tell you that you're not allowed to be upset that he has been erased from any legion rules that come out. It's just a complete betrayal. Some points costs were adjusted and some rules changed for the better (and a few for the worse) but the end result was actually fewer options at a model level. Pointless, bizarre changes that just removed flavor and uniqueness from the army."

In order, they are:   Chaos Demons Tau Sisters Inquisition Nids Legion of the Damned Guard Tempestus   Sisters isn't going to happen any time soon. Sorry. Legion of the Damned got rolled into the new Marine book (afaik?), and Inquisition will likely just be a little online only book again, if anything. Nids got a sizable update during the last campaign set, whatever it was called again. We haven't seen anything about Tau or Guard in a while, so they're a maybe.  Most likely, there will be a chaos tie in with Sigmar coming up soon, so I would expect something similar to how the Khorne Daemonkin book for another of the big bad gods except for Slaanesh. She got benched for the Great Horned Rat in Sigmar, so seeing that at the same time as 40K is unlikely. That leaves Tzeentch and Nurgle. GW seems to enjoy releasing new books as often as they rerelease old ones now, so my best guess is that we'll see another Daemonkin book of whatever flavour, plus probably Chaos Marines. Then Tau, then regular Demons, then Guard.   Then again, considering GW, there will likely be another Space Marine book tossed in there somewhere, whenever a particular set of quarterly financials needs a boost."

Warhammer,3e1ulo,torealis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"Essentially, given that Alpharius is only the height of a very tall marine, I figured I could sculpt up a true-scale marine with the Pale Spear and a plasma weapon as a pretty good approximation of the Primarch until FW releases the model.   I've since learned that Greenstuff is something you should never buy in bulk off ebay, mine seemed to melt a little as it set. I've lost a bit of detail off the original sculpting, but I hope to be able to paint that back on eventually."
Warhammer,3e1ulo,NomranaEst,2,Tue Jul 21 08:50:21 2015 UTC,"Looks like a solid start. Have you worked with GS before? I haven't heard of melting GS, and I've had some that's years old that's still good to use. Keeping it in the freezer should help it to keep for longer.  Thin plasticard would certainly have been better for the shoulder guard detailing than a flattened sausage. 0.25mm or thinner is generally good enough.  Still, for a first attempt, it's admirable."
Warhammer,3e1ulo,NomranaEst,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:19:07 2015 UTC,"I have worked a little with GS before, mostly making capes. This stuff was pretty tough at first mixing, whereas I've found the GW GS is more sticky and gooey. This stuff seemed to swell or melt or something, either way where I'd cut details or a little scale pattern into it it seemed to fuse back together like rising dough."
Warhammer,3e1ulo,_Mr_Butlertron_,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"That's very strange. Never had GS do that to me. I'm at a loss as to why it would do something like that.  Something to keep in mind is lubrication of your tools while your manipulating the putty. Without that lube, you can drag the putty around and lose surface finish or detailing, or just pull it straight off the model. Water is pretty good for it."
Warhammer,3e0qxu,Dweller101,4,Tue Jul 21 01:52:33 2015 UTC,"looks good, some advice for future pieces:  Static grass looks more realistic over the top of drybrushed ground or at least with less of a border between ground and grass, need to add some more randomness to the edges.  your hills/slopes are a bit too uniform. Throw in some more randomness for a more realistic look.  your rocks look awesome, the clumps end a bit abruptly you could have some more scattering around them.  sorry if i sound negative, these look great, especially for a 1st try, just want to offer some advice."

Also, maybe instead of painting black into the recesses you use a wash like Nuln Oil? Again, it's just a bit more subtle than the flat black :)  But for tabletop quality it's bang on."

Yeah just try making it 1 part distilled water and 4 parts Nuln Oil.  Plus it never hurts to go over any sloppy bits that leaked out during the washing. Fix it up with whatever base colour you're using.  It's already tabletop ready to be honest :) Depends on how anal you want to be.

It is not subtle enough and it is making your models looks messy.   I think you should use less and maybe try using two colors. First hit it with a darker grey that blends in with the green so it is less noticeable. Then use the metal color very slightly on top.

Warhammer,3dz8f8,swarmdk,2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"Howdy.  I cannot personally vouch for them, but a quick search of EBay shows TTCombat ""Snappy Stencils"".  Looks like they are a MDF laser cutting company, as they sell terrain and other goods.    Here is a link to the imperial eagle stencil: Ebay link  I have used a variety of stencils in the past and I can say that stiff material like mdf would be hard, as typically you want to be able to bend the stencil to fit the shape of the object.  Also thick material is more difficult to affix to the model for airbrushing (I like to temporarily tape the stencil in place, and mdf seems like it would be too heavy).  Think about where you might be using the stencil - if it is on a very flat spot it might work still; if it is round or irregular it might be more difficult (Think giant shoulder pads on Warden Knight).  Often times with all the air stencil companies, the scale is very difficult; as they are often far too big to be used on miniatures.  It is hard to tell from the picture on Ebay, whether the stencil would be too big for your project, as there is no real indication of scale.  I really like the company AirSick Stencils, they have a line of ""mini stencils"" and I have purchased several of those.  Even those stencils are on the larger side, and only suited for large vehicle areas, or banners.  Unfortunately, they do not have an imperial style eagles, but do carry a variety of other stencils.    Hope this helps"

I mean at 1500 points a baneblade is hard to deal with.  But again, like any game talk to your opponents about how you guys are going to play before you start and do your best to agree on some rules."
Warhammer,3duvfz,Bears4Khorne,8,Sun Jul 19 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"Nope, thanks to 7th edition rolling Escalation into the main rules you can have 1 LoW per Combined Arms Detachment (1 HQ, 2 Troops required) and gone are the restrictions on 1 'Primary' (old name for CaD) detachment per 2000 points."
Warhammer,3duvfz,ashrid5150,10,Sun Jul 19 19:18:27 2015 UTC,Sure you can field a LoW in a 1000 point game as per the rules but that doesn't mean the other guy will play you. Not every army has viable options to handle LoW units so it's considered a good sportsmen courtesy to inform your opponent about using them in friendly games.
Warhammer,3duvfz,Vankraken,4,Sun Jul 19 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the Horus Heresy rules have a condition where the LoW can't be more than a quarter of the points (i.e. 500 for a 2000 point game), and my gaming group tends follow this rule for regular games as well because it allows the enemy to have a better chance at what you're fielding, which I think is important for havin a game both of yall enjoy"

As someone who primarily plays Imperial knights nowadays I get a lot of shit. But it's no different from telling someone you refuse to play against him because he's playing orks.   The rules are there to tell you what's fair enough to bring to a pick up game or tournament. Play with your friends however you want, ignore any rules you want, add whatever house rules you want. But people who show up for pickup games and complain about their opponents legal list just because they don't have a direct counter are piss poor sports."

If someone came to you and said ""Some guy at the store refused to play my Green Tide Orks today"". You'd think it was ridiculous.   If you refuse a game with someone because you don't have a direct counter to their list then you are crapping on their fun because you can't have fun playing a game you don't have an advantage in.  Just play a game you know you're gonna lose once in a while. Have fun with the act of playing, not just the act of working towards a win. Maybe even pull a win once in a while.

I played for 5 years as chaos marines using raptors as a fluffy Night Lords lists. I went 2 of those years without winning a single game (The Streak was fucking legendary at my LGS). so even if you really can't win you can have plenty of fun on the losing end of a fight with no chance in sight."

If I'm playing against my friends then sure we can have some fun shooting the shit and playing some lopsided games. I don't want to play a stomp or some dragged out boring match in a casual pick up game. I wouldn't fault somebody for not wanting to play vs a Green Tide list because those games can take forever to set up, move, and resolve CC. Same if somebody didn't want to play vs a blitz brigade. I would offer to adjust my list to more agreeable conditions but if an agreement couldn't be made then we don't play and I find a new opponent. A lot of people prefer to not play vs Tau so I'll offer to use my Orks instead. I don't fault people for want to avoid unfun matches no matter the reason."

I've never once had my game ruined by the persons list. I've had games ruined by shitty people, but never their army.  I don't know, I guess i just get pissed because people completely discredit my Knights list. Everyone who plays it raises a huge fucking stink until they blow one up. Realizes that they only have to do that 2 more times and they've won. Realizes that everything in the game crumbles under focused fire and playing with 3-6 models on the table, even knights, is a huge risk that backfires as often as it pays off."
Warhammer,3duvfz,AveDominusNox,3,Mon Jul 20 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"None of that makes it fun.  I get no enjoyment from shooting the same model time and time again.  I want a game that's adaptive, enjoyable, slightly tactical and with more mutability than painting a fence.  Turn 1 - Shoot at the nearest Knight.  Turn 2-7 - Do the same thing.  That's boring.  I can do MANY other things with my time than play a game as monotonous as that and it has nothing to do with me being a bad sport."

Warhammer,3duvfz,FearsNoSpider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:00:45 2015 UTC,"If you can wipe out an entire army with one shot, even an apocalypse blast, then you are playing on too small of a table or your opponent needs to learn that a unit is in coherence as long as the models are within 2"" of each other (and that that is not a suggestion, if your models are closer than 1.5"" you forfeit your right to complain about blasts IMO).   I've played 5000+ points games on a normal 6'X4' table where it was difficult to spread out units, and between cover and smart unit placement it was still possible to mitigate the baneblade to the point that it actually wasn't worth killing."

Baneblades are probably the most balanced of the super heavy vehicles.  They have a huge amount of fire power and survivability, but not more then they should, and if you get cocky with it, your opponent's anti tank units will drop it like a bad habit.    The two with the turrets are solid choices, but only a few of the fixed gun ones are from what I remember.  A lot of it is situational stuff from what I recall."

Warhammer,3duvfz,Chewy0atmeal,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"It might just be the point levels.  1500 is a bit low to have a good game with a Lord of War.  Ether they'll nuke it turn 1/2 and your army will be crippled, or they can't stop it and it rofelstomps their whole army.    That said though, Tyranids and Necrons both have tools to deal with it if your opponents have the models.

Leave it a little while and then move it around again to ensure that all areas are getting hit by the Dettol. The rest of the treatment would be the same as in the guide I wrote.  Good luck!"

Warhammer,3du2fp,jimcdiver,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:01:50 2015 UTC,I think you're wrong about this. I made a case for wound counts here.
Warhammer,3du2fp,AgeOfSkubmar,6,Sun Jul 19 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"1w for 1w Clan Rats will never ever equal Phoenix Guard or Swordmasters. Yes the clan rats get better with some numbers, getting a 3+/3+. But they STILL aren't as good as Phoenix Guard's raw stat line. Add in the 4+ ward save and battleshock shenanigans and it's not even close. Better than it might first appear but a horde of ""horde"" models are still shat on by a horde of ""elite"" models.  The real problems are, however, two fold:  2x1w model is not NEARLY as good as 1x2w model. This problem becomes very clear if you have seen a few lines of Ironguts or an all cavalry army in AoS just wreck face. 10 Bretonnian Grail Knights will walk though 40 (twice the number of wounds) clan rats like they are made of tissue paper, killing around 20 on the charge, taking back 2-3 wounds if you can even pile them all in and you'll be lucky to have any rats left after battleshock. Ogres are worse.  Internal balance is complete SHIT with a wounds=points system. Why would you ever run a clan rat when you can have a stormvermin or a spearman instead of a phoenix guard?"
Warhammer,3du2fp,jimcdiver,-2,Sun Jul 19 15:30:25 2015 UTC,"All this was true in the previous edition, though. Clanrats never beat an equivalent points value of grail knights (or phoenix guard, etc.) barring fantastic rolling. It's only when you put the whole army together that the poor performance of bad infantry units is outweighed by their strengths."
Warhammer,3du2fp,AgeOfSkubmar,2,Sun Jul 19 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"The thing is that it's not a matter of 'equivalent point value' anymore. You are saying, by saying wounds = points, that 1 clanrat is worth 1 phoenix guard/swordmaster (just to be consistent with the other guy)  In other words, a 40 man block of rats should be worth a 40 man block of phoenix guard. Which, I hope to sigmar you know is not true.  The big blocks that 'lost' to their equivilant point values used to be useful to tie up other squads because they were cheap, now, they aren't any more cheap than their far more powerful bretheren.  Why would you ever take a 40-50 man clanrat squad for tarpitting/anvil when you can just take a 50 man squad of your strongest elite troop."
Warhammer,3du2fp,Darkreaper48,0,Sun Jul 19 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming that 40 rats = 40 phoenix guard. What I'm saying is that wounds = points is a good guideline that allows you to do the pre-game deployment/balancing process much more intelligently.   For example, how many clanrats should you deploy to counter a 12 wound monster? You'd start by assuming about 12 wounds and go from there."
Warhammer,3du2fp,AgeOfSkubmar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Actually no, I'd start by assuming about 24-36 rats, depending on how pimp the monster was.  Just look at the age of sigmar starter, if you've played it yet.  The Sigmarite side has 37 wounds. The Khorne side has 64 wounds.  Yet, if you've played it, you know that the Khorne side doesn't even come close to stomping the sigmarites (despite having almost 2x the wounds! Oh the insanty!). In fact, I believe the Sigmarites have a distinct advantage."

Warhammer,3du2fp,drakeAndrews,4,Sun Jul 19 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"I think you may be waiting for a while. Any tournament run on wound counts will be won by a summoning army that can double and triple their force quickly and easily. If there are ""sufficient"" summoning restrictions, then by Ogres or Sigmarines because multi-wound models are amazing. If there is a comp pack comes out that makes multi-wound models not goddly then I'm betting on High Elves for their elite 1w models of ass kicking.  Any system predicated on wounds for points is doomed to failure.  And I thin kyou'll be waiting a long, long time for a tournament pack from GW. They don't support that mode of game play."
Warhammer,3du2fp,drakeAndrews,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I honestly don't think we'll be waiting that long. They know everyone is waiting for it and it has been announced.

Fantasy, a game routinely outsold by the Space Marine tactical squad box, was dying. You can still play it if you'd like, no one is going to break into your house and steal your rulebooks. But here's the thing:  Tournaments do not make any money.  Tournament players do not spend massive amounts of money, despite what people seem to think. I mean they spend a huge amount on things like air fare and hotels but relatively little goes on the hobby (comparatively). And with this they bring a huge set of expectations and supposed entitlements.  Not to mention the continual cry for ""balance"", where no one can define it more than "" [new faction] is op plz nerf"" or ""I just lost a game against [faction] plz nerf"". Want a truly balanced game? Go play chess.  There are plenty of other wargames that support the win at all costs competitive style of play. Maybe go play one of those instead? The rest of us will be playing AoS with our friends, and we'll still be here in six months time when all the naysayers have gotten tired and gone home and people understand that games don't have to cater to everyone."

Frankly, I'm very happy with the changes they've made. I'm a competitive player within the confines of my group and I make an effort to support GW and buy stuff whenever I can.  That being said, I think they should have made at least some effort to support even casual tourney play. i will continue playing the game and buying stuff and hope to God that someone comes up with a tourney standard for the game not unlike ETC or Swedish Comp or whatever the kids call it these days.  Warhammer is the first and only table top game I was ever into, I have neither the time nor the energy to go to another system. I like AoS for what it is, but I think it needs just a few touch ups to match what it could have been in all of our minds. Believe me I'm just as fed up as you with all the crying arseholes out there.  I'll be waiting patiently for something to happen."
Warhammer,3du2fp,Frenchit,0,Mon Jul 20 12:47:12 2015 UTC,"It's impressive how wrong you actually are and how the GW's toxic ideas can infect players.      Tournaments themselves are not money makers and most games that do tournament play take the money collected from entry fees and turn it into an equivalent store/event credit which breaks even.      However, what tournaments do is grow and promote players getting together to build an active community and grow the meta.  When you have a tournament people will come to the shop/event and buy random things.  It can be glue to repair a model damaged in transit, a new model or unit for the army, or even sell new players on buying into the game if they see people playing in the tournament and having fun.  Without a healthy gaming community a game will die and instead of doing things that actively promote a healthy community or a competitive game we instead see Games Workshop push the ""Beer and Pretzels"" bullshit harder and harder.      And if you want a balanced or competitive game look to basically any company outside of Games Workshop.  Warmachine and Hordes have thriving communities and the game is constantly gaining ground, especially in places where GW has priced themselves out of the market such as Australia or in countries like the US where they continue to shit on their independent retailers in favor of their 1 man closets.  The same is true for other games such as X-Wing, Malifaux, Saga, and even historicals which will continue to gain shelf space as GW moves more and more of their catalog to direct order only so that shelves can be dominated by Space Marines and Sigmarines.  The only people that seem to believe that it's somehow impossible to balance a miniature game are the people heavily drinking the GW kool-aid.      And good luck with Age of Sigmar in 6 months.  The game is absolute trash on every possible level and while it can somewhat function between friends it is literally impossible to play in a tournament or truly competitive environment which makes pickup games at the store or growing and expanding an active play community difficult if not downright impossible."

That said, you will still need to do a little bit of pregame balancing depending upon what your opponent brings.  If your opponent brings an army that is built similar to yours (e.g., mix of elite and ""normal"" troops) I think the list will be fine. If not, be ready to change the list a little around the edges as you're taking turns setting up your armies."

Warhammer,3dqrs4,razzeldazle,13,Sat Jul 18 23:40:54 2015 UTC,"Looks great!   But I actually have some problems.  Brettonians are French High Middle Ages.  Their clothes are heraldic.  And heraldicly, a lot of those tinctures (colors) aren't tinctures, or just don't go together that way.    Rule #1 of heraldry: colors go on metals, or metals on colors.  Never put colors on colors, or metals on metals.  The reason for this was to maintain high contrast for battlefield identification.    The colors are: Vert (green) Azure (blue) Gules (red) Purpure (purple) and Sable (black)  The metals are: Or (gold/yellow) and Argent (silver/white)  And for the most part you did great, just working of of the ""feel"" of the middle ages.  But you've got a green shield with a black fleur, and a blue shield with a red lion's head, and a gold lion on a blue shield (which is fine!) on top of a red flag (which isn't -so just paint a white or gold border around the shield and call it good.)  Orange (tenné) is a very unusual medieval color (properly, a ""stain""), but it was definitely used, especially in German heraldry, but should not be used as a field for a black (sable) charge.  But we can pretend it's gold (or) and ignore that one.    Bleu-celseste (sky blue) is unusual but totally fine!  Turquoise, though, being both blue and green, is kind of a big problem.    I don't think anyone else will ever notice though, but you asked for C&C, and that's what I got."

Yellow was horrible though."

Warhammer,3dscvu,motski666,2,Sun Jul 19 01:24:33 2015 UTC,very common problem. you are holding the can too far away from the model.
Warhammer,3dscvu,apalehorse,2,Sun Jul 19 00:11:27 2015 UTC,Damn. Is it okay to paint over or do I have to apply another layer of spray? I don't want to start losing details by spraying on more layers if possible.
Warhammer,3dscvu,apalehorse,4,Sun Jul 19 00:14:44 2015 UTC,"you have a few options - 1. strip it with simple green and a toothbrush, 2. smooth it out with model sandpaper, 3. apply another coat of primer and hope it doesn't get worse, 4. just paint over it.   stinks when this happens. i think it may also have to do with the conditions when you are spraying it too far, ie. wind and humidity. good luck."
Warhammer,3dscvu,turkeygiant,3,Sun Jul 19 00:31:09 2015 UTC,"I just went step 1...its a pain but really your best option if you want to ensure the best results.  If the mini is fully primed with the paint I would let it soak for a while in the simple green, the paint will separate almost like peeling skin, then go at it with an old toothbrush in a bowl of water. I ask if the mini is fully primed because I always worry about putting the raw plastic in any type of solvent, you want it soaking the primer not the plastic as much ass possible."

Warhammer,3dscvu,eosgreen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"You can try spraying closer to the model in very thin layers and it might flatten out the uneven layer. Alternative is to give up and try stripping off the paint with simple green, but in my experience simple green won't take off GW primer."
Warhammer,3dsc6r,MoeSauce,2,Sun Jul 19 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"cut costs. no tzeentch mark. termis and abby have no tank right? that's not ideal. if they are with abbadon then anything you look at dies so you dont need to pump up his escort. drop the gift and the combi and give the champ a lighting claw or PS instead of a fist so that he can potentially win in a challenge if you detach Abbadon at some point.  drop the other melta on the lighting claw guy and give him a fist instead of the claw. he is your tank popper. the other guy is fine. the truth is that you want them in assault and assaulting a tank is better than a one use melta, but they are a relatively cheap upgrade so ...  the plaguemarines are just on the board without rhinos? i wouldn't do that if they were my only troops. also, don't they already have fearless? if so, i'd drop VOTLW if it is an option (cant recall at the moment).  drop the gifts also. they just aren't worth it.  isn't it the case that if the defiler shoots the battle cannon that it cannot shoot the havoc launcher? if so, drop that.  chaos got shafted with stupidly expensive models so the lower the game points the worse off you are. i'd look to increase mobility and cut costs."
Warhammer,3dsc6r,apalehorse,3,Sun Jul 19 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Plague marines do have fearless, at first I was confused but now I see what you mean, they do not need the extra leadership.  I was taking VOTLW for hatred but maybe it's not worth it?  Some quick googling revealed you're right about the defiler so he's gone and that frees up a massive amount of points.  I guess the gifts of mutation were also pipe dreams haha, I imagined rolling really sweet mutations but now that I think about it, they ones I roll usually suck.  For my now free points, should I put everything I can in a land raider/rhino or pump up my squads with more models or add in some fast attack?  I appreciate the feedback."

The antitank is nice and AV14 at 1000 points is too. You can fit that and rhinos in with your list of you drop the PW from the nurgle sarg and just give them a plague knife.  Fewer bodies means you need more mobility and resilience."

Warhammer,3dqwna,Mangonaut_,3,Sat Jul 18 16:20:17 2015 UTC,"Not so keen on the name. ""Brazen"" as in ""Bold and without shame"" doesn't seem to really fit Space Marines that well and it also feels a bit too old timey/archaic. Brothers also makes me think of them as equals among eachother, which might be something you'd like but idk. I'd also look at giving ""That System"" a name. As a Dark Angels successor chapter do they have any of the usual ties that other Dark Angels successors have? Are they always treated like royalty on their homeworld? What kind of industry is there on said homeworld? Dark Angels successors and they don't like bikes? Since they don't like psykers how do psykers on their homeworld get treated? What about the Navigators, though they're not Psykers? I also wouldn't call a load of standard pattern power armour suits artifacts or relics. What are their thoughts on Terminator armour since their, apparent, progenitors make use of a number of them? Pre-heresy armour isn't that unusual amount Astartes. Does their deviation from the Codex Astartes not bother the Inquisiton, or Administratum, at all? At which point do the recruits have to make that big climb, before or after they've had some of those handy Astartes implants? Do the implants from the Astartes not kinda infer that the humans weren't created quite as ""Pure"" as could be? Would this bother some of the people on said unnamed homeworld?    Overall the fluff seems fairly ok but i think it needs a bit more fleshing out and maybe some basis in existing fluff."
Warhammer,3dqwna,Grandmaster_C,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for the comment  So i am going to try and answer the questions you gave me  So from the top  I am gonna keep the name as The Brazen Brothers(though i see where you are coming from) But it is more meant in the brass sense and boldness rather than shameless  yeah early stages so no key locations or any thing but i'll get round to it eventually.  I will work on that too  They built a relationship from the time they took command of the system and if any doubts or rebellion existed in the populations mind, 8000 years is long enough to purge those thoughts from the minds of the people.  They have a rather small industry on the homeworld, enough to support the planet. The chapter gets most of the tools from the forge world in the system and the raw materials are mined from the other uninhabitable worlds in the system.  Fuck bikes  On the homeworld the pyskers that are found already being extremely rare are given to the inquisition. And astropaths are well treated with a begrudging acceptance.  Well I understand your point on the armour but i think the reason that it is pre-heresy is the reason why it is like a relic for the chapter. And I mean pre-heresy armour is not a common sight in the imperium, some old chapters have working suits but alot of them hold them as treasures and use them for cerimonies or give them to their elite. The Red scorpions chapter have a hard on for them, because they have the technology to create them, while the Brazen Brothers have 200 and can only maintain them.  Terminator armour wise is that they use them but they don't have a hard on for them like the dark angels.  The deviation from the codex doesn't really bother the Inquisition much as they still retain a company set up it is just the setup of the elite companies which stray from the codex  The recruits make the journey to solidify their positions as marines, but lets say its like a really flat cliff face.  This being pure thing is more of a chapter thing and is more to do with pure gene seed and it being untampered with."
Warhammer,3dqwna,Blood_ForTheBloodGod,2,Sat Jul 18 23:00:41 2015 UTC,A Forgeworld making solely MK IV battle plate is the only thing I found weird about the lore. Forgworld can produce all the weapons for an entire solar system worth of combat.  But I enjoyed it nonetheless!

Warhammer,3dp7cr,MightyExaar,4,Sat Jul 18 03:29:16 2015 UTC,yeah i think the purple is overdone on the right one.  the one on the left has a good balance of color.
Warhammer,3dp7cr,BlackFysh,15,Sat Jul 18 13:14:50 2015 UTC,"The painting on both is nice, but the right one is more focused.  The left one feels unbalanced - my eye keeps being drawn straight to the lower half of the model, since the tabard, belt decorations/knife, and shield cram a lot of purple and gold (both very attention-grabbing, especially when there's so much together) into one place, instead of spreading it out like on the top half.  It's quite distracting.  The way that the white was used as a ""spot colour"" on the right one ensures that the eye is drawn from the helmet to the legs, and then to the shield, which means I end up focusing on all the major parts of the model.  It may be more subdued, but the colour placement is much more balanced, which means it's more effective.  The brass also helps, since it makes for a nice complementary colour, and it isn't distracting like the gold would be.  You could try altering the left colour scheme and see if you can make it work better though - you'd just have to reconsider the colour placement and ratios.  Even painting the belt knife in muted colours and swapping the purple on the shield for silver would help, since it would break up the gold a bit and make it easier to focus on individual details."

Warhammer,3dp7cr,feor1300,2,Sat Jul 18 13:27:06 2015 UTC,I think he could probably fix a lot of that on the left one by making the shield silver with the hammer in gold and the lightning on the hammer in purple.

The weird thing is, Ive been in a lot of nerd hobbies (video games, computer building, comic books, action figures) and Warhammer (and perhaps wargaming in general?) is by far the one with the most women in it, from what I've seen.  And they're generally treated as equals more often than in any other hobby I've been in, too.  It's really refreshing.  Now I'm not a psychologist here, but I would guess that has something to do with a huge portion of the hobby involving meeting people and talking face to face out in the real world.

Warhammer,3dm6bz,gribblewielder,-15,Fri Jul 17 17:20:08 2015 UTC,Press releases are labeled as press releases.  This isn't a press release.  Do you understand that press releases are labeled as press releases?  Press releases also don't normally mention competing games.
Warhammer,3dm6bz,giggity_giggity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:24 2015 UTC,"It reads like a press release, I imagine the graun got sent one and adapted it for their house style and to turn it into a piece of journalism, although your theory that it's obviously a conspiracy ad is sensible too"

Warhammer,3dm6bz,elemmcee,9,Fri Jul 17 15:19:12 2015 UTC,Right...  Making the game more accessible to a wider audience is poor business. Making your rules free is poor business. Lowering the barrier of entry is poor business.
Warhammer,3dm6bz,DoctorDH,-15,Fri Jul 17 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"Hell maybe its just my peasant brain but seems to me, from all the out cry, there was money to be made in finishing the rules books for 8th.  Seems to my simpleton brain; that the End Times would have been a perfect time to release the AOS rule set instead. Fans could then have enjoyed a completed and balanced 8th. While using there models in the new rule set, as campaigns were released furthering the story, giving more incentive to buy the new things.  They could have told the end times story without the background being ""skaven killed everything we don't talk about"" they could have done small limited editions books and models for any of the following: Chaos Dwarfs, kingdoms of Ind, Cathay, Nippon, Araby, the border princess', they could have done special releases of ogres, orcs, skaven and elves with regional themes all to tell the stories of what happened where. This doesnt even touch on the existing armies, which could have benefited from the limited edition releases/campaigns also.  It was the perfect chance too finish things, move them forward and bring in new and old people alike. in to a world already full of detail and promising much more.  instead they are desperatly pushing a game, filled with obvious flaws with a large vocal disinterest, distrust and resentment. so yeah .... poor business choices  Edit:   that is too say, all of what you said, Kinda misleading as it is, could have been done without leaving irate fans (and there is a lot of them) screaming ""don't do it"" at potential new fans, at same time."
Warhammer,3dm6bz,elemmcee,7,Fri Jul 17 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"Why yes, doubling the number of factions to include niche stuff in an all ready niche side of the business would definitely attract new customers and drive sales"

Warhammer,3dm6bz,elemmcee,11,Fri Jul 17 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"Your analysis is simply incorrect.  AoS is a direct continuation of the ET story. GW needed to do something drastic. WFB sales were 13% of total sales. They were making more money on paint than the entire WFB range. AoS is massive gamble but they had to make a bold move. And this is incredibly bold.   You do have a point though, GW could have kept on releasing books and models for WFB and watched as the sales and the player base continued to decline, as it has for years. Or they could take a change and try something new.  People still fail to realize how exciting this new direction is. Calling 8th a complete and balanced game is hilarious. It wasnt even close. Because of the points system there was an illusion that the game had balance. Now, GW has removed that illusion and give all of the power to the community. The potential for what AoS could be in about six months time is truly staggering."
Warhammer,3dm6bz,DoctorDH,-8,Fri Jul 17 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"Staggering? really?    AoS is a direct continuation of the ET story.   go on, tell someone the history of the storm immortals.    there was this guy, sigmar, who was a man in a setting(that no longer exists), and he became a god (in that setting that no longer exists). then 2250 years past in that setting and he poltergeisted the body of an emperor in the land he once made. right. then everything ended. but didn't cus sigmar was a wind of magic after a while too. anywho he stopped there being nothing by making stuff in a relm. but he didn't make everything. Anywho he was fighting chaos and needed bigger humans, so stole them from across space and time, got a dwarf friend to incase them in iron, i mean sigmarite, that some how does not impede their movement. and that's how we got them. cool huh?   Such continuation, much relevance.   You do have a point though, GW could have kept on releasing books and models for WFB and watched as the sales and the player base continued to decline, as it has for years.   intellectually dishonest right there. i said finish 8th, as in beastmen, brets, skaven. don't think 3 books is spending years watching it decline. And hell it may not have been the most balanced thing in the world but it's easier to find a match against someone who free to make up armies within a system, instead of hoping someone has the right models to act out a scenario in a book they might not have. i mean when was the last time/how often have you acted out ANY scenario? because they have always been there to act out.  They did have to do something. AOS rules once complete Could well be that something. But ending a setting, that took 32 years to make, in less than 1 year is just shity. and as said before those rules could have been used to play out end times. over a longer period of time in greater detail"

But your comment just made me laugh.  ""power to the community"" indeed.  We were so oppressed before, and now we have this amazing ""power"".  Clearly, if sales skyrocket and stay high it will have been a correct business decision to branch into this new product line.

Mars is an anarchic nightmare shithole the moment you leave the safe zones into the kilometres of labyrinthine corridors beneath it full of rogue machinery, self-aware and malevolent AI from before the Fall, and the daemon programs of the Heresy. EVERYTHING in the databases is fucked. The databases are fragmented over the entire surface to the extent that it would be impossible to see one tenth of the total files in the ludicrously extended life of a Magos even assuming that they are completely safe to visit. And they are not.  The files have been corrupted into madness by the Fall, and the unleashing of the most potent informational warfare systems ever to exist to defeat the Iron Men. Nearly all of Mars was rendered uninhabitable, what they live in now is built on the top of the ruins. They send archeotech expeditions in to find shit, nearly all of them never come back. The sheer number of rogue war machine running around in there is sufficient to rape the mind. Then came the Heresy, which was not earth-exclusive. Mars as the second most critical planet in the Imperium was the site of fighting nearly as ferocious as on Terra, with Mechanicus loyalists and Hereteks fighting tooth, nail, and mechadendrite everywhere. Ancient machines were unleashed, viruses both normal and daemonic unleashed into all the computer systems. Nearly every single stored record on Mars was rendered unusable, and those that survived are half the time self-aware and don't like you, or daemonic and actively try to kill you.

Bravery 5 on state troops makes things go south quickly and being able to ignore it on 1's or 2's with the 2 dice from the banner is ~55% chance of ignoring battle-shock which allows the general to keep tossing out hold-the-line.  I've ran a pretty similar army, I've just taken Greatswords instead of the pistoliers and demigryphs. They are incredible now since as long as there is a character within 14"" they hit on 3+ and wound on 3+ with 2 attacks each.

Pistolliers actually did suprisingly well, shooting 10 shots before disengaging and repeating. A great way to harass slow infantry. They where the only unit to come off without a scratch."

If they pop just one model out of any of your units then you lose the to hit bonuses, but if you go much bigger than 20 man blocks you are sure to get sudden deathed. I'd say drop on of the 20 man halb blocks and the pistoliers, and then up the other two blocks to 30 big. Just my two cents."
Warhammer,3dnnbu,Swww,3,Fri Jul 17 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna run Mechanised, why not use a Tank Commander instead of the Company Command Squad? The Company Command Squad is normally a support unit that gives orders. In a mechanised list like this, you'll give orders less often and the concentration of plasma guns only makes them more tempting targets.   Also, remember that Chimeras have 2 firing ports, so having more than 2 special weapons does no good unless the squad intends to disembark. And a Company Command Squad out of a vehicle, in the thick of fighting, with expensive equipment is dead.  If you take a Tank Commander or Pask as your warlord, you can benefit from the tank orders and the strengths a tank commander provide.  You have an extremely high concentration of heavy anti-armour in the list. At 1000 points, most players don't bring masses of heavily armoured vehicles and the veterans with meltaguns would not be as useful. Meltaguns have extremely short range, so if you want those veterans to fight, they have to be close to the enemy and those veterans make up a large part of your force - they will die. Players commonly used melta-equipped Veterans in Chimeras as a suicide squad, but that's in mid-higher point games where you can spare points for a suicide squad. You probably have too much heavy anti-armour at the expense of anti-infantry. The enemy is guaranteed to bring some form of infantry and using melta veterans on them is probably a waste. You also can't really hold objectives that well with melta veterans, due to their extremely short range. If your meltaguns are out of range, then your very expensive Veteran squad only has 7 lasguns to work with.   Assuming your Leman Russes are battle tanks, then a Lascannon does almost no good. Leman Russ Battle Tanks have Ordnance primary weapons and if an Ordnance weapon is fired, other weapons the unit tries to fire can only fire snapshots. Is a 1/6 chance of landing a hit really worth the lascannon? In a standard game, the game as a whole will last about 6 turns. On average, a single snapshot will hit once if fired every turn, and that's before going into wounding and saves.  At 1000 points, most players don't bring flyers or only bring 1. Flyers are powerful and many players discourage bringing them in lower points games due to their strength. Classic guard tactic against flyers is just to use the autocannons they love so much and turn them up to shoot at flyers. You land a hit eventually. Alternately, Hydras are relatively cheap and deadly against flyers and skimmers.  As guard, it is normally considered smarter to bring more units to the field than give upgrades to existing ones, especially in lower points level matches. One of the guard's main strengths is having cheap units. They are not durable, so units with expensive upgrades will often just die."
Warhammer,3dnnbu,IVIilitarus,2,Fri Jul 17 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"Pask in a punisher with an executioner buddy can do no wrong. Bring a primaris psyker to twin link the unit and they will destroy everything. Executioner lets pask get within 24 inches, and the psyker prevents the executioner from glancing itsself to death. (Unless I am reading that rule wrong). Pask in a punisher is good against everything without a high armor value, will eliminate a unit a turn. Split fire the executioner with tank orders and you can pop transports at the same time."

I think that changing the melta guns in the squad for plasma guns would help but then I am a little stuck as to where to make up the points (asside from the obvious plasma pistol and LRBT upgrades...) . I think the 24 inch range would be more useful than the 12 of the melta while still being good against MEQ"

You've got your vets for anti-tank and your CCS for heavy infantry.  I'd be tempeted with stock demolishers if you want a jack-of-all-trades russ, it does it so much better than the standard one, but are more expensive.  Or you could go with dozers and heavy flamers for a decked out demolisher (the flamers when you're too close to fire the demo-cannon).  I often run demolishers, they are great for drawing a lot of fire from fear, making your vets more survivable."

So I cant do an easy arm swap and am not totally happy with size of the lasgun.   I am considering using the normal WW2 rifle they come with and doing something to it.   The main goal here is to pay less the $30 for 10 guys in static poses. The bolt action guys are 40 for $38 so im pretty dead set on using them as the base.
Warhammer,3dnbm3,ManicMuffin,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"I say try the Victoria Miniatures Lasgun, it might be a little smaller. Also I'd avoid using helmets, the Ushanka/Fur Cap is way more Russiany."

Warhammer,3dj257,theredeemer,10,Thu Jul 16 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"Don't mix in paint. Use that same water effects (if it's the moldable one), but grab the end of a brush and draw in ripples and waves. Next paint over it, start with a dark red and ease up to bright at the peaks. Next grab some Tamiya Clear Red and go nuts.

The last time I tried to paint was in 2007 but I was on medication that caused my hands to tremble uncontrollably and it was to frustrating to keep going.  It was not until this year that it was adjusted and suddenly my hands were stable again...I figured I'd give the old hobby another shot.  This model took a lot of time as I figured out the best way to build it that would allow painting without blocking things off.  I actually painted the entire internal cabin assembled which turned out to be helpful surprisingly.  All in all it took four days to finish, I just finished the base minutes before posting the pictures last night."

Warhammer,3dhimx,Karrick,9,Thu Jul 16 16:22:15 2015 UTC,It looks REALLY good. I just hate the way GW made the wings. Side gunners would make absolutely no sense when the wings cover like ~70% of the FOV.
Warhammer,3dhimx,Sojoez,5,Thu Jul 16 12:25:43 2015 UTC,This always bothered me about the model too.  Would love to hit those rocket launchers with a heavy bolter shell at point blank range.
Warhammer,3dhimx,PandaMango,5,Thu Jul 16 15:03:24 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with these statements!  I did not put the sponson gunners in until the very end, as I did not want them swinging around inside while I painted the aircraft.  This was exactly the first thing that came to mind and I was distinctly glad that I had angled the Heavy Bolters at a downward angle to at least give some semblance of a legitimate firing arc."
Warhammer,3dhimx,apalehorse,5,Thu Jul 16 15:24:48 2015 UTC,The game Space Marine gives a nice PoV from a Valkyrie gun turret. No rocket pods and the wings seem lifted. I guess the game designers figured that out as well.

Warhammer,3dhimx,WindsAndWords,2,Thu Jul 16 13:14:28 2015 UTC,I think the hardest part of the interior was ensuring the colors make sense in relation to the other panels on each side.  I tried to cluster the colors in a way that would fit in reality while also keeping the number of colors used restricted to tones that fit the overall color scheme of the unit.  I was really hesitant about using yellow but it made sense for caution lights and in the end I was happy with how it fit into the cabin.  Thanks for the kind words!

Warhammer,3dhimx,DeskRaven,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:02:46 2015 UTC,"Man, they can be a total pain to put together.  One of those troopers is missing a forearm because there was no other way to get his gun into a believable position that did not leave his right arm with a large gap under it.  Right now I have another Elysian squad unassembled with 5 scions primed to complete a ten man squad and another full squad w/ Command Squad sitting unassembled.  The Elysian's are going to take a while due the inherent cost but I am hoping to field the Scions in an Air Cav formation once I can get more Valkyries.  I've even ordered a Krieg Commissar to make sure the haz mat re-breathers are universal across the unit as one is required in the codex.  Not going to lie though, if money was not an issue, I would be knocking out the D-99 team first after reading the Anphellion fluff.  Thanks for the compliment!"

(You can see my painted stuff in my submissions)  I do really like the scions and I like their fit with the Elysians. My Company Command Squad is a mix between the Scion models and some Kasrkin metals.

Black or brown wash on the metal parts will give them a dirty or oily look and help bring out the natural contours of the model.   after that try some dry brushing on the painted areas which would naturally get wear such as the front of the ram or on edges, just a little boltgun metal (iron breaker or what ever) could really give it that used look and help make your paint job look a bit more natural and less ""like a paint job""!   I love the thought you have put in and that your model tells a story. keep it up!"

The great thing is that it's very flexible; if you want less dense forests you can pluck as much ""trees"" as you want, or cut the mesh base in different shapes.

Furthermore like it's been said here already, the rules coming out for the races are going to be a bit more serious and functional.

This new edition has convinced me to give warhammer another try, I have bought more from GW in the last couple weeks than I have in the last couple years, and GW is going to be very happy about that.  The people who are screaming the loudest about AoS not being the stodgy old game that was Warhammer Fantasy, are more often than not going to be the same stodgy old fans who haven't bought a thing since their favorite army was updated 3 or 4 years ago. They can't be considered customers anymore so GW doesn't need to oblige them in any way."

Warhammer,3dpak1,SonofCarnelian,2,Sat Jul 18 18:02:59 2015 UTC,Of course it's unfinished. It never will be. But being so new and different to before it will need a bit of time to develop and find its feet. 3rd Ed 40k was the same when they re wrote the system for that.
Warhammer,3dpak1,SonofCarnelian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:53:29 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, they could have at least worked a bit more on army composition and game types before releasing it. It seems that they sort of shit on the more competitive players and balance and proper army restrictions is really the key to playing a fun game against strangers.  40k 3rd was where I got into 40k, but it still felt like a complete system. It could be that it's literally been over a decade and I've gotten used to complete systems, so my view may be a little off. Either way, GW had two complete systems with many iterations and a number of side games that have has moderate success.  It's not like they didn't have something to work from, especially since AoS is moving more towards 40k for playstyle. If they were doing something completely different, then I'd understand, but AoS feels like a watered down 40k using fantasy models. Hell, the Dark Vengeance box used similar slates to the warscrolls to teach the rules to beginners. (I actually love the idea of war scrolls, but that's not the issue here)  I'm still interested in seeing where AoS goes, but it feels less polished than a kickstarter game atm to me."
Warhammer,3dpak1,Ave_Dominus_Nox,4,Sat Jul 18 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"There's 2 main points here. The first is that GW has never cared about  competitive play anyway. They'd put on their own tournaments sure but very much as an afterthought and it doesn't matter what version of warhammer you're playing people have never been happy from it from that point of view. That's the reason most comp things so much. The armies have never been balanced either with every army book having many units that no one would take because there would be better options if you playing from a purely competitive point of view. Nothing will change here as anyone putting on their own tournament can just impose their own restrictions. I'd imagine it will take a little while to settle but expecting any kind of balance from the start is unreasonable.  Secondly playing against strangers isn't the focus, it's playing fun games against friends or a group you play with on a regular basis. The first game might be unbalanced but then you know more what will produce a fair match up. The mindset of the studio isn't that win at all costs produces a fun game, it's working with your opponent to produce a narrative wargame you both enjoy. Thats not to say it's not competitive, but i've seen a lot of comments about putting as much as you want on the battlefield where for me at least part of the fun will be how much less can I put on the field than my opponent and still beat them.  Concerning 40k, it's only superficially similar because people seem to concentrate on the round bases but the whole way combat and heroes work is very different. In some ways it actually makes me think more of Warmaster. They could have just fit fantasy models into 40k but they haven't actually done that, it still seems like it's own game.  3rd Ed 40k was very simple compared to 2nd and is actually what got me into warhammer fantasy. It went from my armies having a lot of flavour and individuality to everything playing much the same and there being very little in the way of special rules, wargear or rules for anything but infantry. Decent Vehicle rules for instance came out in a white dwarf update years later.  Lastly, it's only been out for a week and at least the warscrolls for existing units have more individuality than the units had in ravening hordes for instance at the start of 6th. Will it turn out good? Who knows. There is some stuff I like and some stuff I don't but i'm willing to give it a chance for now."

They had one of the best, most interesting, most fleshed out fantasy world in the IP world. And they threw it away! They literally threw it all away. They could have even had a awesome worldwide campaign to end it and go out with a bang like Eye of Terror but they didn't. With the flick of a pen it was gone.  Also, I was always drawn to Fantasy by the look of all those gorgeous, lined up ranks. Now it's more round bases. I really dislike the loose unit look.

Warhammer,3dpak1,nwarwhal,0,Sat Jul 18 05:22:53 2015 UTC,Okay take care I'm gonna tell you something that might sound very strange to you but is actually amazing. Building fair army lists that are competitive ARE fun. The fun is not connected to retarded rules.
Warhammer,3dpak1,mannotron,9,Sat Jul 18 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I fully understand how some people can find competitive armies fun and I'm also not the kind of player to bend over and take it like a champ. That said though I don't like the feeling in some metas that I'm 'forced' to take competitive options.  In 8th edition I took an infantry heavy empire army because I loved the look of the Empire Greatswords and still do. There were certain players in my local store that played competitive dark elf armies with the whole lore of shadow/death, dark rider and doomfire warlocks deal and playing them wasn't fun. I was well aware I could build a more competitive army using demigryphs, steamtanks and lore of life but that's not the aesthetic that appealed to me. That said though it's not like my list was bad, I still took archers as chaff in core, buffed up with lore of light and warrior priests to help mend the failings of my greatswords to help keep them at least playable.  Ultimately I don't care about what the unit does on the table and how it helps me win, what I care about is how the Countess' Own held against the brutal onslaught of chaos warriors with the Countess slaying a Chaos Lord in a challenge and surviving with just the champion and the countess left. Or how they braved the fire of dwarven cannons to drive the enemy out of the watchtower, and when I make 7/8 of my 5+ shield of faith saves I shout ""Sigmar protects"" because it helps me feel invested in my unit (and a unit I spent 500+ dollars building at that)  I understand the need for balance and competitive armies, I don't like seeing my heroes lose over and over just as much as people competing don't like it. The only thing I'm trying to say is that there are many facets to this hobby and I think that playing for fun and getting invested in who your army is is just as important as winning games and we shouldn't focus entirely on winning games as  it loses out on the fun stories our armies can tell, you just have to look for them."

Warhammer,3dkq71,Marbodoesntforgive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:30:05 2015 UTC,The warlord trait gives Infiltrate to the warlord +3 units.
Warhammer,3dkq71,Marbodoesntforgive,2,Fri Jul 17 03:35:36 2015 UTC,"I use Raptors as my second army and it is an every model I have army. I have to use everything to reach a 1500 points so it is hardly an ideal WAAC force.  That said, I still do very well with them. The ability to move everything on the board to where you want is awesome. Lias is obviously a must have. In restrospect, I with I had most scouts to go even father into the infiltrating, but here is how it works:  Lias plus Grav Cents infiltrate into cover deep in the middle. This is the ultimate anchor unit. You put the sgt in front with Lias right behind. It will absorb so much firepower with its T5 2+/2+ save. In addition, having them in the middle of the board lets them be in range to murder everything with their Grav. You basically never have to move. It becomes a target that is hard to ignore because it is so killy, but at the same time shooting most stuff at them is a waste.   I like to infiltrate one tactical squad, one squad of sternguard, and one squad of terminators. I put them into key spots to make them threaten everything and land them into some kind of cover. I also use one drop pod with a Ironclad Dread inside. This is backed up by two long range Dev squads with 4 LC and 4 Plasma. Since everything deploys in cover and gets shrouded everything has a 2+ cover save turn one. Everything is forward deployed to be in range to strike an ideal target. It creates a weird situation for your opponent in that he has too many targets to deal with and they are all super durable. He will have to focus fire on one to do anything. Even if he gets first turn this means he will really only neuter one unit. Once I go, I try to put the DP Dread behind his lines threatening a target that can't hurt it in close combat.  I use my firepower to murder his key stuff. Afterwards the game usually is a mop up. I seriously can't recall a time I have lost with them, though I play them infrequently. Most of my meta likes to do 1850 so they don't come out too often. Also I don't like to spring FW stuff on the unsuspecting.   Legendary Marksmen is pretty nice, but don't expect it to win games. It does let your bolters hurt stuff that is normally immune. Also I find that my units are usually separated into static ones and mobile ones. So the static guys do get a nice buff from it."
Warhammer,3dkq71,Marbodoesntforgive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:23:39 2015 UTC,"Funny, this is most of my space Marines as well. I'll write the list out so you can give me some pointers.   Laas Librarian (L2), Auspex Tactical w/ plasma and Lascannon Tactical w/ plasma and Lascannon Scouts w/cloaks Terminators w/2 Assault Cannons Bikes w/2 melras, multi melta, powerfist Devs w/4 Plasma LOTD w/ melta and multi melta  All squads are 10 strong aside from the LOTD, mist squads have teleport homers and melta bombs."
Warhammer,3dkq71,Bears4Khorne,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"Well the key to my list is that everything is able to threaten something turn one. 40k is very much about target priority. What is the key threat and what can be ignored or mitigated? With extensive infiltrate, you can get pretty chose exactly that. The downside is that you have next to no mobility after turn one. If you aren't where you want to be it can be hard to reposition. You have to have a good alpha strike and follow on turn 2 strike to be successfull.  To do this with my list, nearly everyone is very long range killy or they utilize something that lets them soak wounds. Everything is a threat turn one and everything is hard to remove turn one. This is what you should be striving for.  A good example is my Terminators are a poor choice in general mostly because of price vs utility. What makes them work here is that if they do actually get into close range they will murder everything and infiltrate lets me do that. They simply cannot be ignored, but they aren't that easy to remove either because of 2+ and the other saves. It is the same around the board, the Devastators have a long range and good damaging power, so it is hard to get past their cover save with enough long range weapons. The Ironclad Dread is invincible to small arms and will eat anything or at least hold it in combat forever unless it has a lot of power fists so it has to be dealt with turn one. Tactical squads are the easiest things to take out and really they are a minor threat, but you simply cannot ignore them because of Legendary Marksmen and the fact that meltas or multi-meltas are already in range turn one.   The issue I see with your list is that you have a lot of less optimal choices that don't fill those main goals of being killy and durable. LOTD are the only unit that should be in reserve. Everything else needs to be deployed so drop THomers. Librarians are poor choices unless you go hard into the psy phase. 2 psy dice not give you enough muscle your way through the phase and get the powers you need off. You probably have too many Terminators. Assault Cannon Terminators are not long range killy enough and so you have like 200+ extra points sunk in than what you really need. A single lascannon in a tac squad is not so hot.   I hope that gives you some ideas. I feel like my advice is a little all over the place. The core idea summed up: Strong Alpha Strike with shooting and be able to weather the counter alpha strike. Be super killy and durable turn one. Then turn 2 hit him again and he should be crippled. If he isn't it is going to be hard for your to maneuver to get objectives and accomplish the rest of your goals."
Warhammer,3dkq71,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:01:51 2015 UTC,Optimization was my biggest concern. This is pretty much all the models i have but I'll see what i can convert up or swap around.
Warhammer,3dkq71,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:25 2015 UTC,"Double reply in case you wouldn't see the edit.  What heavy weapons would you recommend for the terminators and Tacticals. I don't have many extras, an extra heavy flamer for the terminators and 4 plasma cannons, 3 lascannons, and 3 heavy bolters for the power armor dudes. Special weapons have fewer choices with me only having 2 plasma guns and a flamer power armor dude. I have 2 five man LOTD squads armed with melta and multi melta each."
Warhammer,3dkq71,SandiegoJack,2,Mon Jul 20 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"That is what I would probably take with the LOTD. Or maybe one flamer/HF, one Melta/MM. Depends what you need. They are not bad naked too since their weapons ignore cover. They are great for clearing out intrenched IG or Guardians.  On Terminators I would go AC or nothing. I would probably just take SB. Terminators are too expensive and the heavy flamer is only useful on them if you are deep striking. They shouldn't be going against a horde anyway because you they will just use mass attacks to get past your save. Better to just use SB and move forward as quick as possible.  On tacticals, if they are infiltrating I usually take melta or plasma. Thing with tacticals is that usually can't get enough weapons to make good use of their specials. Since you have Marksmen, just going with bolters is fine. You need to look at as ""Do I have enough anti-tank and anti-horde with the rest of my army""? and fit out your tacticals that way.  HW on tacticals are kind of a waste when you have free devastator spots. Make Dev teams out of those PC and LC.   Heavy Bolters are crap. MM are kind of bad too unless you can Infilitrate with  Melta and MM in the same combat squad."
Warhammer,3dkq71,HelmutIV,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"IMO you should infiltrate a squad of stern guard instead of terminators as they can use the chapter tactics with their special ammo. Use the terminators as an oh shit defensive move or as a surprise with deep strike. I also have a raptors list and I like to play fluffy, but I suggest dropping the bikes for something more useful with the chapter tactics as relentless doesn't apply to Legendary marksman.  If you are looking to scare your opponent infiltrate some stern guard and grav cents into the center of the board. With deep striking terminators and Lias's no scatter rule, it can be hard for armies to counter effectively."

Warhammer,3djh49,valhalle,3,Thu Jul 16 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"You have grasped the basics of edge highlighting and that part looks great! As you continue to do it, you'll learn where high contrast edging looks great and where it doesn't.  If you show this model to 100 skilled miniature painters, 99 of them are probably going to advise you to work on your paint consistency.  Acrylic paints generally aren't intended to be used right out of the pot. They need to be watered down to the consistency of milk. The problem when you first try this is that you will probably become frustrated with how the paint applies so much differently than when it is out of the pot.   Firstly, it will be experimentation with your consistency. Too little water and you don't broach the issues that you've got with this model you've photographed. Too much and you're not going to have good enough control over the paint.   When you water down your paint to the correct levels, you will find that you need MUCH less paint on the brush. Counterintuitively, the paint underneath will also show through, making you think that you need to apply more paint or make it thicker. The correct method in this case is to apply more layers after each one drys, rather than more paint at once.  Think of it as you putting a thin film of watery paint over the layer before, building it up gradually over time. Pro painters will do this with 20-30 layers in one small area to get the fantastic gradated color changes you see on Golden Demon level models. You don't need to be that extreme, but 4-5 layers is a good start.   There are many tutorials out there on YouTube that will show you good paint mixing consistency and its application onto a model. Once you have this process down, you will REALLY open the floodgates with your miniature painting abilities.   Good luck fellow Asrai.  Edit: Here is a really good video showing this process. He has painted a model with robes not to dissimilar to your aelf with a dark red, then done a red wash. This video starts at him mixing the paint for the ""highlighting"" process. https://youtu.be/uG9LGTs2kPw?t=5m"
Warhammer,3djh49,ohmss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:01:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info and the video. Yeah I'm thinning down the paints already as someone suggested but as you said it will take time to get my own feel to it.

Warhammer,3dk2i6,HeadStar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's used an airbrush to achieve that effect. So unless you have one of those I don't think you'll be able to replicate what they've done.  EDIT: I should add that the glowing effect is a lot easier to pull off than you might think. Remember that fire or heat starts from a central location and then cools as it radiates outwards - it will be bright almost white hot at the centre, and then a bit yellow, then a bit yellow-orange, then a bit orange-red (if you want a molten lava like appearance then you want some black too in order to show where the material has cooled down back to original colour).  So start in reverse IMO, go with the orange-red, then yellow-orange, then a bit yellow, then white-hot for the origin of the heat. If the weapon blade edge is the hottest, then it should be almost white with a hint of yellow. You can see this effect clearly at 2:15 in the video with the glaive-like weapon. The artist has chose then lower centre of the weapon to be the point of origin for the heat."

Warhammer,3dk2i6,HeadStar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:52:16 2015 UTC,Hazard a guess (if you want to use a paint brush - I have no experience in airbrushes)  Primer: Whatever matte black you can find.  Base: Rhinox Hide/Abbadon Black 50/50  Layer: Rhinox Hide (heavy dry brush)  Layer 2: Doombull Brown (medium dry brush)  Layer 3: Jokaero Orange (light dry brush)  Layer 4: Jokaero Orange/Averland Sunset 50/50 (very light dry brush)
Warhammer,3dk2i6,HeadStar,2,Fri Jul 17 03:16:23 2015 UTC,"This is amazing, but can you give me a quick heads up on where to put each layer? For example, cover the whole model or just paint the higher sections.   Thanks again! You've been a great help :)"
Warhammer,3dk2i6,HeadStar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:09:50 2015 UTC,"Primer: All over.  Base: All over too.  Layer: Heavy dry brush, trying to hit all the raised areas while leaving a portion of the Base still showing in the recesses of the armour.  Layer 2: Medium dry brush, just hit the last 10-20% of the raised areas.  Layer 3: Light dry brush, just hitting the last 5-10% of the raised areas.  Layer 4: Selectively light dry brush, only hitting the areas which would be normally exposed to easy line of sight e.g. if it looks to be in shadow, don't hit it with this layer."

Warhammer,3djsbo,ANakedBear,3,Fri Jul 17 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"Speak with your local gaming store and see if they have an escalation league planned in the near future. That way, you can build your army in increments and have people to play with. Alternatively, see if you can con a friend into starting with you. Set realistic point goals as you both build up to 1850 points.   You do not need a full 1500, 1750, 1850, or 2000 pt army to start playing. I'd argue that waiting until then would risk burn out. Also, your final list will likely change as you play and see what works."

Warhammer,3djsbo,RyGuy997,3,Fri Jul 17 06:01:28 2015 UTC,Tell me the army you're interested in and if you prefer shooting or assault. I'll give you ideas.
Warhammer,3djsbo,apalehorse,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:19 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely an expensive hobby. Figuring out a list to aim for is a great way to start, but it's also putting the Cart before the Horse in a way. Best bet, as others have said, is to start small. Get yourself enough for a Combined Arms Detachment, aim for about 500 points worth. Thats' one HQ and two Troops. take them to your local store and play. talk to people. Then as you play, think about the next points milestone, perhaps another 250 points. what does your core lack? need more Dakka? want something tougher? quicker? etc.  I've built a few armies from scratch (i'm doing up some Astra Militarum right now), and that's the best and most cost effective way to do it i've found. If you can get a friend into it at the same time, you can have your own mini Escalation. Set a date to have a certain amount of points by, then play some games. then choose another date and another points value. The bonus to playing mates is that you can also ""proxy"" miniatures. this unit of 10 guardians are actually striking scorpions, etc. it gives you a chance to try before you buy.  Welcome to the hobby! Good luck!"

Warhammer,3djsbo,Grandmaster_C,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"Slowly  I have 10s of thousands in points of models.  I didn't get there over night.  It took 15+ years of slowly buying, painting, and playing to get to where I am now.  Don't jump to a competitive level list for your first jump into the hobby.  I only have my competitive lists after years of tailoring my force to fit my exact play style and combining dozens of kits bought over that time.    If you like Eldar, great, stick with them while you learn the hobby.  Focus on good buys with kits that will see a lot of use like Wave Serpents, Guardians, Dire Avengers and Warlock/Farseers.    The Windrider Battle Host and the Eldar Battle Force are amazing first buys.  Both have enough models in them to let you start playing and learning the game while giving you models you will find a place for in even competitive lists.  I especially recomend the Battleforce as with a bit of conversion creativity from just what comes in the box, you can make 15 Dire Avengers instead of 5 Dire Avengers and 10 Guardians.  (Though both options are great choices)  This plus the book is maybe $200 USD.    You can easily expand off of this by grabbing kits you feel would add to you force and fill in holes or some kits that just look great.  (the Eldar have almost no bad choices)    Any kits look good to you or is there a direction you'd like to go with for your force?"
Warhammer,3djsbo,ANakedBear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:28:50 2015 UTC,"Start slow. Buy things that look cool, have fun assembling and painting them. Repeat whenever you have money to spare and want a way to spend your free time. You'll have at least 500 points in no time at all, which is more than enough to play with. Hell, i'd say starting that small is probably better when it comes to learning the rules.  Just keep assembling and painting the units that you like the look of. You'll hit 1000 by the time you're competent, 1500 by the time you're confident, and 2000+ by the time you've got a circle of friends or acquaintances to play with. After that most people tend to branch out in to new things. The overwhelming majority of people I have played with have several ~2000 point armies."

I've kept track of nearly every dollar I've spent to get there and its very near 600 dollars. to break it down for you this is what I've achieved with my money:   22 pots of Games workshop paints black undercoat spray 2 paint brushes (one of which I have fucked which is uber annoying) 1 tactical squad 1 assault squad 3 attack bikes librarian ultramarines upgrade pack pallet paper protective case (cause i ride a motorbike to my GW, I dont wanna break my dudes) glue and various Games workshop tools (yeah, it they cost a lot, so what? I like the hobby and have a spare dollar to throw at it)   the models achieve about 498 points wise, not sure about eldars point costs. so your spending may be more or less.   For me its a very addictive hobby and I love it, I've recently moved state and going to games workshop helps me meet new people outside of work which is awesome, plus I love my models.  I never aimed for a competitive army, sure I don't wanna get thumped but if I'm buying a model that I hate just to be competitive then I think that's a huge waste of my money and also, my time. why would I want to spend hours painting a dude I hate the look of!? I'm also fortunate enough to have a very good scene for GW where I live, everyone is friendly and the matches can be either dead serious or a just whatever they want to do, it's pretty awesome. people need to stop being so god dam serious and have some fun once in a while.  how did I get into the hobby though? I spent about 5 years of my life looking at the models online, and always thought that people would think that I was a nerd if I bought them. I finished my degree, moved state, got a job and thought to myself: why do I want to spend my life not doing something I'd thoroughly enjoy just cause someone said it was nerdy? so I went to my local games workshop and bought the models that I'd loved for so long - assault marines!   also if your having trouble justifying the costs, open up excel and make yourself a spreed sheet on all your expenses and make it work. no point living your life not doing what you want to do (as long as you don't dig yourself into debt...)  tldr; 600 dollars (AU) for my 500 points of space marines, if you wanna get into it make sure it fits in with your other expenses, don't spend your life not doing thing's you'd like to be doing."

The old warscrolls are there for you ""to reenact the battles of the world before time"" or ""play with your current range of miniatures"". This is also why bases are ignored for the purposes of measurement, as round bases would have the advantage over square bases.  In the AoS lore, there was a period of peace, prosperity, and utopia,  that lasted for thousands of years before Chaos finally decided to fuck shit up again. In a fantasy universe now set in space with Gods walking about willy-nilly, creating vast empires out of seemingly nothing, its not entirely implausible for these other realms (which are actually other planets) to have already had a native race in them, or the Gods could have just made some as the Old Ones did in the Old World, creating the Orcs and Elves to fight Chaos. After all, these aren't Wood Elves anymore, they are Sylvaneth, and these aren'd Dwarves, but Duardin etc.   Its just going to take some open-mindedness and patience as GW rolls out more stuff for AoS. If you really want to learn about the lore then you should probably pick up the novella and starter set which contains a 96 page lore book which fills the gap between End Times and AoS."

For the red/ purple, its more up to the color you are going for. It's a little hard to tell from the photo, but usually highlighting using the color used before being washed is a safe way to add some depth. (ex. base with color A, wash this for shade, reapply color A avoiding deep recesses where the shade has settled.) Do this to the loincloth too"

Good and evil were not part of it. Elric's world was biased towards chaos so they desired more law, and therefore saw a small increase in law as 'useful' not ethically good. Too much law would have been equally bad.  Of course, modern GW chaos has changed a lot from those days."

Warhammer,3dghdn,LoneWolfMark,2,Thu Jul 16 02:11:00 2015 UTC,"Nice work.  As far as C&C goes, I suggest adding a contrasting colour in some way... eg, power cables, purity seals, eyes, inside of the cloak etc.  Something like a light blue or green perhaps. At the moment it just all fades into a blob of red/orange/brown. It doesn't catch the eye. Even a lighter coloured base might do the trick.  You've done that a little bit with the red purity seal and cables, but red doesn't contrast with brown and orange, so the effect is greatly reduced.   Obviously this depends on what kind of look you're going for but I find in general that models need some sort of contrasting feature."
Warhammer,3dghdn,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the criticism.  I see your point and a contrasting colour somewhere could really help. I could easily brighten up the cables on the head and lower torso and I'll most likely change the purity seal to a purple.  I think the one thing that I'd like to draw the eye would be the galvanic rifle, so I might change up everything on that. I'm thinking I'll change the detailing to a gold, and well... I'm actually a little stumped on what I'll do for the body of the rifle, but I'd certainly to do something.  I'm going to be quite busy today, so I'll have another go at one of his buddies with a few changes on Friday and compare."

Warhammer,3dghdn,Theflyingpengy,2,Thu Jul 16 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"MUCH better =) The better photos probably help too. The base looks heaps better and the grass really helps break up that big blob of brown. Just go round the edge with black again to tidy it up.   The cloak looks much better and again, the transfer helps break up the big blob of orange ( can't remember if you had a transfer before).   Depending on how light/dark you want to go, you could do a tiny bit of silver edge highlighting on the very tips of the rifle.   Otherwise, the only other thing I would do is add a bit more color to the back pack... make some of those buttons and knobs different colours for example.   here's some shitty over-exposed photos of my skitarii. http://imgur.com/a/2e5OE Mines, a lot brighter and less muddy (haven't weathered him yet or put transfers on) but hopefully you can see what I mean with adding the contrasting colours."

Warhammer,3ddndj,bloodstainer,13,Wed Jul 15 17:13:10 2015 UTC,Openworld and sandbox are pretty much synonymous in gaming nowadays. GTA is described as sandbox as is the elder scrolls games and they're both story driven games.   Generally when they talk about randomly generated stuff they use the term procedural generation and even that doesn't negate having an actual set story line that then opens into proceduraly generated quests.   All that being said this sin't gonna be a triple A budget game so we shouldn't expect huge things. Could still be good though. Gotta reserve judgement untill we see more than a simple teaser though.

Witcher III an somewhat open world, but calling it a sandbox is a crime against humanity. But since the early access sandbox glitchy shit fest on Steam, the term ""Sandbox"" generally is very negatively loaded and I don't think any self-respective developer should pick up that word with a stick."
Warhammer,3ddndj,bloodstainer,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the only new thing would be systematic quest creation and not pre-determined quest creation, which I think isn't possible with voice actors. We'd need more details to figure out what they're going to do.   Sandbox, story, and rpg aren't impossible to combine though, they actually work pretty well together. I'm going to lean hard on my example of GTA; Rockstar has mastered combining story with sandbox."
Warhammer,3ddndj,LugganathFTW,-4,Wed Jul 15 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"Its not possible at all, the amount of programming to create this would require... 10+ authors, and tens of thousands of lines of code. You would have to create so many different variables to make sure its not just kill 10 bear asses. And even to create something like that would require immense work. Look at how Skyrim's thieves guild quests is generating, those quests would take hundreds of hours to create. and that's from bethesda, this pretty unknown dev is claiming they'd do that to the major quests in an entire world? Sorry but I see overhyping from a mile away and this smells of overhyping corporate bullshit selling bullshit.  GTA V isn't an RPG at all though, Story does not equal RPG. GTA V is a sandbox world"
Warhammer,3ddndj,bloodstainer,5,Wed Jul 15 20:30:56 2015 UTC,"Uh, yes they do?  That's pretty much what Dark Heresy is in pen and paper format.  I'm sure there will be several large areas to explore and take quests in.  My only hope is that there is some sort of heavy character customization, instead of sticking us with some over the top try hard.  It's a warhammer game, customizing your army and characters in terms of appearance and wargear, is an essential part.  Space Marine was a cool game, and the multiplayer customization was cool, but I don't want to be some big dopey generic looking space marine the entire game."
Warhammer,3ddndj,DrCoquenbols,-6,Wed Jul 15 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound like they're making a DAI/W3/TESV build. it sounds way more like an open world empty sandbox filled with shit, rather than an actual 40k RPG.   The premise he tried to sell sounded a lot like an empty game, not anything close to exciting.  If he just said ""We're making a single-player 40k RPG"" I'd be hyped, this sounds like he's just trying to attach popular labels from the Steam top sellers."

And no, an arena style shooter FPS is easy, its much more about weapon design and balancing maps.  Creating an open world RPG takes a lot more time and effort. Skyrim took 5 years to develop and the devs continues to make content another year after release and most of these features were things they said they wanted in the game on release if they could have put it in there."

Warhammer,3ddndj,bloodstainer,2,Fri Jul 17 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"He's not claiming anything like that. This is literally, quoted word for word, what he said:  ""...the story will continue “in a colossal sandbox game” that the developer claims will give players “years of constant entertainment, gradual development and a continuous flow of content that enriches the action-RPG gameplay.”  Show me where he says it's an ""auto-generated story"". In fact don't bother, you don't need to. You can't, because he doesn't say that at all.  A continuous flow of content could mean long term support with new quests and updates. It could mean mods, it could mean community driven content, it could mean new campaigns, expansions, daily quests, similar mechanics to Rifts and bounties from Diablo 3, it could mean literally anything but you've decided to shit on it because you've imagined something that wasn't even said by the developer.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going all out hype-train for this thing, as Van Helsing is the best game they've produced so far and it was, in all honesty, a fairly standard action RPG, but if you're going bitch and moan and cast aspersions on the developer's ability to make the game, at least do it over something that was actually stated and not imagined by you."
Warhammer,3ddndj,Kirioth,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:03:47 2015 UTC,"He's either claiming its Skyrim x15, which is just a straight out lie.

You seriously think ""colossal sandbox game"" ""years of constant entertainment, gradual development and a continuous flow of content"" sound like a rich RPG? Or just a MMO-like RPG filled with boring things.  ""Kill 15 cultists.""  ""Kill 10 cultists""   ""Kill 20 Orks""   ""daily quests, similar mechanics to Rifts and bounties from Diablo 3""  Daily quests, rifts and D3 bounties are horrible. They're just grindy shit.

Warhammer,3ddndj,ch4ppi,10,Wed Jul 15 18:21:43 2015 UTC,The MMO was actually really good. The problem was it was heavily PVP and there just weren't enough players to support the world.  It died simply due to low numbers.   It was also during the time when WoW was at it's strongest.... the graveyard of MMOs that tried to dethrone WoW during those days is immense. Many tried and failed (they still do today).   I think the warhammer mmo failed more due to the current environment than the game itself.

People don't realize that C-list video game studios are ""shitty shit shit"" studios.  We are talking like this one and others who make spot games here and there.  No one can really say these guys deserve a higher than C-list when you have companies like Blizzard and Valve dominating the A-list and Netherrealm and Gearbox going at it in the B-list.   The thing I don't like is 40k deserves a good game.  Not a C-list game, I'm talking at least B-list stuff.  The license is tailor made for amazing RTS and 3ps battlefront type games.  They just need to get good studios who can make their own engine and aren't just using the latest free one from Unreal.

My point in writing this up was not to suggest that clanrats are perfectly interchangeable with stormvermin, or that counting wounds can 100% guide your army selection. The goal was to show that if you're a Skaven player who wants to know how many clanrats they should bring to balance out against a demon prince, wounds is a reasonable place to start."

Warhammer,3dject,mild_resolve,3,Thu Jul 16 19:46:40 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Chaos Warriors have 2 wounds each. So it would be 40 goblins versus 20 Chaos Warriors. I haven't played that particular match-up, but I do know that means both sides gets their maximum model-number bonus.  So we have 40 goblins with +2 to wound rolls, and 20 warriors that can reroll save rolls of 1.  Someone with more experience able to theory craft that kind of a match-up?"
Warhammer,3dject,mild_resolve,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:09:07 2015 UTC,You're right - my mistake.  Let's say 40 goblin warriors vs. 40 Hammerers.
Warhammer,3dject,c1vilian,2,Thu Jul 16 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"Two things:  1) If you balance using wounds, it's a unit of 40 goblins vs. a unit of 20 warriors.  2) Do chaos warriors ever wound on 2s?"
Warhammer,3dject,mild_resolve,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"You're right - let's do Hammerers instead of Chaos Warriors.  Goblins will hit on 2, wound on 4's.  40 attacks.  5+ save.  Hammerers will get 80 attacks... hit on 3's, wound on 3's, rend -1, and have ""stubborn"" if they're within 16"" of a dwarf hero."
Warhammer,3dject,c1vilian,4,Thu Jul 16 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"Well, you also have to consider that goblins can either use bows and swords allowing for them to kill Dwarfs with +2 rolls from a distance, something that I know Hammerers have difficulty with.   Not to mention strategically placed netters reduce the rolls of the hammerers and can make 3 attacks with the only difference is they wound a 3+.  Sure, once the dwarfs get into melee its going to be a toss up, but I think it still sounds rather fair. (I'll also throw in a mention that a night goblin unit has a better leader, with x2 effectiveness of a standard unit compared to the hammerers x1.5 effectiveness.)"
Warhammer,3dject,feor1300,3,Thu Jul 16 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"Fine. Let's make it REAL simple.  Compare 20 hammerers to 20 2H dwarf warriors.  They both have 20 wounds, but the hammerers are better in every way."
Warhammer,3dject,DrProfHazzard,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:23 2015 UTC,"Well, if you limit your imagination then certainly. Shield dwarves have different uses than hammerers, and generally have better defense. Not to mention they have defenses against wizards, which much like anything ranged can easily tear apart hammerers.  In a one on one fight against 20 hammerers and 20 2H dwarves? Yeah, I'll vote 9/10 times in the favor of the hammerers (rend basically destroy's the dwarf warrior's defenses), luckily this game isn't based on one-on-one fights but rather about overall army composition. You see your enemy is bringing tons of wizards? The hammerers might get obliterated before they have a chance to be useful, the Dwarf Warriors have a 1/3 chance to complete negate spells used against them.  I'm certain there are more 1:1 fights that are exceptions to this guy's idea. Like Hammerers versus Militiamen or something. Bretonnian peasants don't scale well into larger numbers at all, but I guess they do have range which basically lets them fight with two rows of guys instead of one.     I'd say the idea really falls apart once you start getting to characters like Nagash. Nagash may have 12 wounds, but he's going to tear apart a small army by himself."
Warhammer,3dject,mild_resolve,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:59:13 2015 UTC,"I've suggested before that if you're balancing by wounds you need a multiplier for things like Nagash.  If it has the ""Hero"" on ""Monster"" key word you count it's wounds for double (So, an 8 wound hero would count as 16 wounds). If it has both muiltiply by 3. (so Nagash would count as 36 wounds)  Also, having ranged weapons can be a MAJOR advantage, since it usually lets you attack twice. As long as your weapon doesn't have a minimum range you can shoot into the unit you're in combat with in your shooting phase, and then attack them in the combat phase."
Warhammer,3dject,mild_resolve,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"I actually asked a similar question comparing warriors to Iron breakers at my shop.  I asked, ""why would you ever take warriors over ironbreakers?""    And their response was ""you wouldn't.  And you didn't in 8th either.  It was way better to get longbeards.  Sure they cost more points but they more than make up for it with how much more they can do than warriors.""  There have always been units that are just BAD.  And you simply avoid them whenever possible.  For awhile, dwarf warriors were unavoidable because you needed a minimum of core troops and you didn't have any other options.  That restriction has been lifted; so now you can take hammerers or ironbreakers in their place.  It's what I'm doing."
Warhammer,3dject,mild_resolve,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:13:00 2015 UTC,"And you didn't in 8th either. It was way better to get longbeards. Sure they cost more points but they more than make up for it with how much more they can do than warriors.""   But that's simply incorrect.  Warriors hordes with 2H were an absolute staple of many Dwarf players in 8th.  Shield warriors were lacking, but they got significantly better with the new army book (shield wall & +1S on charge).  I'd probably field longbeards over them in most cases, but for 9 points vs. 12 I don't think it's automatic.  Also, keep in mind that before the newest AB you had to have a unit of warriors to even take a unit of longbeards.  ALSO, in Warhammer the Dwarven core units were always worse than their special equivalents (i.e. Hammerers vs. 2H Longbeards, Ironbreakers vs. 1H Longbeards, Miners vs. 2H Warriors, 2H Quarellers vs. Rangers).  That's why most players called it a ""core tax""."

Warhammer,3dhbnw,Situis,2,Thu Jul 16 21:03:06 2015 UTC,with glazing you are shading so you START with the 2nd highest color usually. Now I sometimes start with the middle or bottom color and you CAN do it this way depending on the area you are painting but generally speaking using glazes you are shading from brightest to darkest

Warhammer,3dhbnw,Situis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:59 2015 UTC,i glaze shade. Basically everything I paint with is a wash but unlike washes they don't have as much additives to break the surface tension which causes washes to flow into recesses. I then take this usually 4 to 1 water to paint ratio and wipe most of it off and paint a very very translucent layer and progressively go further into the cloak or towards the edge  leather brown - tanned leather - 50/50 tanned leather stained ivory - stained ivory by itself - 50/50 stained ivory creamy ivory - creamy ivory edge highlights

Warhammer,3dfixx,HotDamn18V,2,Thu Jul 16 03:52:37 2015 UTC,"Ok im not going to lie to you. You have the start to a really nice model here but it still needs some work. The good news is youre already halfway there.   First, you really need to give each of those colors another thin coat of paint. Especially the yellow bits, when you are painting yellow over black you almost always have to 2-3 coats minimum to get a nice solid color. There are also a bunch of spots that you seemed to have missed with paint, the fur on the horses legs, edging and backing of the cloth, and in general just try and clean up the areas you are painting.   A good way to keep your model clean is to start with the lowest points first and then paint the up areas, this way if you are laying down your basecoat (in this case the brown fur and red cloth) and you get paint on one of the raised features (in this case the shields and the bridal areas) you cover up those little mistakes when you paint the raise features.   Second: You really need to get some shading and highlighting on the model. The good news is that with the colors you chose its going to be really easy. Take Agrax earth shade and slather it on the whole model. This is a hard step to describe through text so watch this GW video on how to apply shades.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUQsiv41Enw  Agrax is brown but it goes extremely well with reds, yellows, browns, and metals.   Once you have the whole model shaded wait for it to dry and go back with your original colors and go back over the model, leaving areas where the shade settled alone (make sure your paint is thinned so that you get a nice smooth finish on the model) this will give you model depth. For the metal bits you can do a heavy drybrush over it so you dont have to worry about obscuring detail (just be very careful to not get it on not metal parts of the model)  For the highlighting you have two options, Dry brushing (easier) or edge highlighting (looks smoother and nicer). In either case take what ever would be the next step up in the paint line and in the case of dry brushing watch this video.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo0m5ol6P2w  For edge highlighting watch this video.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9bDoIMCSfk  Doing this will help all the raised are of the model to pop out and gives the model extra detail.   Lastly if you painted over the free hand you did now is the time to go back and do it again. Your free hand skills are good and the more practice you do the better they will be.   TL:DR  Get a smooth solid base coat Wash the mini reapply base coat highlight free hand if needed  Also if you are more a picture guy I made this guide for a night goblin showing the steps I told you and the colors are similar enough to apply to your needs.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/2y57vk/bad_moon_night_goblin_speed_painted_45_total/"

I expect humans and O&G to get an update to most the range because its been so long, where as ones like Chaos and Dwarfs which have had a more recent update I expect will just get new minis added not replacements.  Imo both Orcs and some of the basic gobbo infantry look long in the tooth now, I don't think the basic Orcs have changed since before 2000."

Warhammer,3dht9n,ChicagoCowboy,0,Fri Jul 17 06:23:19 2015 UTC,"The models aren't really that much bigger honestly; they're more dynamic, which is why they appear more imposing than normal fantasy miniatures.   The Khorne dudes are roughly the size of warriors of chaos and marauders of chaos as they stand now, just barely larger and a whole lot more dynamic.   The stormcast eternals are about space marine sized, but since they're a brand new army there isn't really any size comparison to old fantasy models.  We'll get a much better idea once they release the first box set that replaces a current kit; then we'll get to see what scale things are moving towards, if indeed there is a change in scale at all (which there does not appear to be)."

Warhammer,3debmo,whiteknight521,13,Wed Jul 15 16:34:57 2015 UTC,"Urgh, some of this is fine, but a lot reeks of ""I haven't played the game, I just dislike these rules"".  Look out sir change: why? You've just stripped the potential worth of sniping characters vs wrecking units. What for? It just makes the game less tactically interesting, because now there's no reason to fire at the character, and no reason not to hide characters in blobs.  Change to cover - why? Cover at the minute is just ""are you in terrain Y/N"". There's no reason to change that. It's just a pointless rule change which will now create arguments. Why wouldn't a unit get cover for being at the top of a hill with enemies shooting up it? It would give cover in reality. Urgh.  The points are hilariously biased. Longbeards are as good as Warriors of Chaos? Grail Knights = Questing Knights? Cannon = 1 but Trebuchet = 2? 20 empire crossbowmen are 3, but auto hitting 20 handgunners are 2? Demigryph Knights are 3 for 3 (12 wounds) but Blood Knights are 3 for 5 (15 wounds, more attacks, can bring models back to life, generally superiors)? What sense does this make at all? The points in no way represent how good these things are on the board at all, it reads as though someone just plucked numbers from the air.  So yeah. It's pretty naff in my opinion. It's a sensible idea and the unit limits are reasonable, but there's just so many issues. In particular, dwarfs go from pretty meh to absolutely useless with these point/rule changes, Brettonia gets hugely shafted for no discernible reason, Vampire Counts laugh their way to victory (I get Nagash and can summon 5 units, plus use all my abilities? Really? Nagash is worse than 6 Demigryph Knights is he?) etc. Don't even get me started on Skaven (slaves roughly as good as clan Rats? Best make them cost half as much!). Noble idea, but needs less personal biases and more actual testing."
Warhammer,3debmo,GaussMouse,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:33:26 2015 UTC,"that's why its in ""beta"".  It is being playtested.  There was a straight formula used across the board.  There is no bias.  its also not a precision system trying to say unit A is exactly as good as unit B, its used to get a general sense of balance overall.  Its fine for people to not like general-systems.  It was expected when it was created that people wouldn't like it for being too general.  However, exact precision is not what this system is intended for.  We are saving that for those coming up wtih 1000 point based systems that mirror the past twenty years."
Warhammer,3debmo,auticus_daerk,2,Thu Jul 16 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"Those are fair points, though they don't address the issue with the random rule changes. However, I would definitely say that the formula is either too simplistic, or failing to account for important information.  Take an example I gave before - Blood Knights vs Demigryph Knights. These are both costed the same for their min unit sizes. Now let's compare them damage for damage, accounting for all bonuses on the charge (leader bonus, damage bonus, etc):  Blood knight unit on charge:   14 damage at rend -1  2.5 damage at rend 0  Demigryph Knights on charge with lances and swords:  3.5 damage at rend -1  ~4.67 damage at rend 0  So, in the best like-for-like scenario for the Demigryph Knights, they just barely manage half the overall damage. The Blood Knights do more damage, and their wounds have higher rend values on average. Blood Knights have 3 more wounds in their unit, of which they heal 1 wound on each model if any of the unit kills any enemy model at all. On top of this, they get +1 model per turn for their banner, and are effectively immune to battleshock (10 bravery means 5 would have to die to fail - which is the whole unit anyway). In terms of saves, the get 3+ against rend 0 attacks, whereas Demigryph Knights get to re roll 1s all the time; probably a fair trade, given that a 3+ is always better, but is conditional (even if that condition applies to most attacks). Demigryphs are not quite immune to battleshock, but don't test until 2 models die anyway, so it's not a big deal. The Demigryph +2"" charge is definitely better than the blood knights always making a 6"", but again it's not a huge deal.  This means that overall, Blood Knights are vastly superior - almost twice as good in combat just damage for damage, better rends, better wounds, can heal and otherwise are about equivalent. Yet they both cost 3 points in this system. In fact, 3 Demigryph Knights are much closer to 5 Reiksguard Knights, though they are slightly superior to them. I just don't understand how any kind of robust formulaic approach could make two units which are very easily comparable, one of which is extremely potent, the other of which is merely above average, and then cost them the same. It's far from the only discrepancy like this too. If you tried to balance around these rules, I suspect that some armies, such as the vampire counts, will find themselves outclassing almost everyone. That's my major issue with the rules."
Warhammer,3debmo,GaussMouse,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:31 2015 UTC,Interesting. I like the simplicity of the point system and the removal of shooting while in melee combat.
Warhammer,3debmo,Poopoopashu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"I think it wont take long until there is a fan-made system like this that will work just fine.

Warhammer,3d98j8,ChicagoCowboy,6,Tue Jul 14 18:01:30 2015 UTC,"As a 40k player, I have always understood the Chaos Gods to be inextricably tied to the sentient races that empower them via emotions/worship, humanity in particular.  And (please correct me if I am wrong) the majority of all sentient races died off during the End Times for Warhammer Fantasy.  So how is it that the Chaos Gods didn't starve off in Fantasy, following such a planet-wide massacre?"
Warhammer,3d98j8,Cerenex,10,Tue Jul 14 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"For the same reason they're always around in 40k - there is more than one world, one realm, one universe for them to feed off of.   I always imagined the warhammer world to be a backwater planet in the 40k universe. We know that since the Eldar race gave birth to Slaanesh, at the very least the Old World exists after the fall of the eldar.   Many speculate that the Old Ones that seeded the planet with life, that built the warp gates at the poles, that crafted the lizardmen to be the guardians of the planet, were in fact the ancestral eldar race.   So anyways, the Old World is dead, but there are trillions of souls for them to feed off of throughout the universe, even in just the single Galaxy that 40k takes place in."
Warhammer,3d98j8,ChicagoCowboy,9,Tue Jul 14 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"Usually yes, I'd agree with that theory.  But according to the new fluff, Slaanesh was captured by a band of mortals after having gorged herself/himself/itself.  If Fantasy and 40k is intertwined, that would mean a group of backwards feudal-worlders managed to capture a being that the Eldar, one of the most advanced races in 40K, can't even touch.  That would mean a band of backwards feudal-worlders managed to capture a being empowered by billions upon billions of humans, as well as several other sentient races, form across an entire galaxy.  Accepting the intertwined setting theory basically implies one of the Chaos Gods is weak enough to be brought down by humans that aren't even on the level of technology the Imperium, on average, possesses."
Warhammer,3d98j8,Cerenex,9,Tue Jul 14 21:40:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, except that they are not mortal. And it wasn't humans who did it, it was the elves. The prevalence of magic during the End Times essentially made 8 of the most renowned characters in the Warhammer world into gods in their own right - each one the incarnate of one of the 8 winds of magic and the most powerful wielder of that force in the world.   Tyrion was made into one such incarnate, the incarnate of Light, so when Slaanesh was too weak to fight back, and since Slaanesh and the pleasure cults have been a plague on the elves in particular for so long, he and his band of demi-gods captured her from the realm of chaos in an attempt to upset the balance of chaos and weaken the other gods.  Consider that this could have taken place before the 41st millenium, or after the current story arc of 40k - all we know for sure is that it happened after the fall of the eldar, since slaanesh is a thing and the eldar created her."
Warhammer,3d98j8,ChicagoCowboy,4,Tue Jul 14 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"Alright, so demi-gods captured Slaanesh in the Fantasy setting. I'm not fluent or even very familiar with Fantasy lore, so I am happy to concede it was not mortals who captured Slaanesh.  But the 40k universe has something far, far more powerful than demi-gods.  Cegorach, an Eldar god with enough power to bargain for the very souls of his followers, the Harlequins, from the Prince of Excess, and win.  If Slaanesh can be sated from a single planet being consumed by Chaos (and bear in mind, we can assume the fantasy world and the souls of the dead was portioned to each Chaos God, not shared in it's entirety), how is it that Cegorach has never attempted capturing her/him/it after the Fall of the Eldar?  In fact, following the proceedings of Fantasy, Slaanesh would be vulnerable to capture every time an entire planet is dragged screaming into the Warp, following the machinations of her followers, for her enjoyment only.  Because I am fairly certain there are more humans on a single hive-world than there are inhabitants on the Fantasy world, of which roughly 1/4th was apparently sufficient to sate the bloodlust of a Chaos God.  See how the problem compounds itself into absurdity?"
Warhammer,3d98j8,Cerenex,7,Tue Jul 14 22:09:32 2015 UTC,It isn't a problem because the two settings are not officially stated as being intertwined. So all these lore problems you are having are self-imposed by subscribing to an unofficial theory.
Warhammer,3d98j8,Taurox,3,Tue Jul 14 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"Not really. Current and most recent fluff has new hints that Cegorach is initiating a fully formed plan to try, GW simply hasn't moved the plot forward to a point in time where it has happened yet.  Remember, She who thirsts was only born 10-11 thousand years ago in the latest possible current 40k setting, literally immediately before the Emperors Crusade. Their birth is what caused the rippling warp storms in the first place. Every primarch, and even a handful of Dreadnoughts are older than Slaanesh. 10 millenia is nothing to an Immortal diety like the laughing god, and it may very well have taken this long to simply come up with a Tzeentchian level deceit to devour She Who Thirsts without awakening Ynnead, or at least to find a way to awaken him without Cegorach losing nearly all his potential worshipers to the Eldar god of Death.   TL;DR: A gods pragmatism, and the omniscient narrators predilection for retelling  the golden oldies (30k) rather than continuing the real story, is not The evidence you are looking for.  Additionally since Khorne was able to lay claim to the broken Khaine after the fall and Khaines loss to She Who Thirsts in single combat, which suggests that Khaine is merely the Eldar manifestation of Khorne, It could certainly be the case that only lesser simulacra of dieties were able to manifest in the warp pocket surrounding the Fantasy world due to presently unknown forces."
Warhammer,3d98j8,amorrowlyday,2,Wed Jul 15 07:27:24 2015 UTC,"Dreadnoughts were first utilized during the Great Crusade, a short while after Slaanesh's birth. Furthermore, only Bjorn the Fell- Handed can boast about the sheer longevity that you describe. To the best of my knowledge, other (official) Dreadnoughts are significantly younger.  Time means nothing to Cegorach, this is true. But the same cannot be said for the Eldar as a species. And since the Laughing God ostensibly draws power from them and their belief in him...   You seem to miss the point however. Assuming the Slaanesh captured in Fantasy is the same Slaanesh from 40k (the joint universe theory), how is it that Demi-Gods can achieve what an actual God can not?   That is the absurdity I point towards, if the joint universe theory is applied.  From a ""fantasy setting on its own"" perspective, my original question was simply how the Chaos Gods did not starve off after all the sentient races they drew power from were extinguished in the End Times?"
Warhammer,3d98j8,Cerenex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:02:06 2015 UTC,"In general I think your right that we are talking past each other, I do want to address a couple things tho.   Dreadnoughts were first utilized during the Great Crusade, a short while after Slaanesh's birth.   True, however that short while is well within the standard lifespan of an average human, to say nothing of a space marine, implying overlap between the persons interred    Furthermore, only Bjorn the Fell- Handed can boast about the sheer longevity that you describe. To the best of my knowledge, other (official) Dreadnoughts are significantly younger.   False. Bjorn is simply the oldest warrior in the imperium of man, and served directly under The Great Wolf. He wasn't interred into a dreadnought until 934.M31 after the Proxima Rebellion. Raugel the Sufferer (who died extremely recently in the canon timeline) was interred immediately after the Siege of Terra which definitely occured within the first 2 decades of M31. There are also a number of canon CSM Dreadnoughts who were present at Prospero and Istvan.   But the same cannot be said for the Eldar as a species. And since the Laughing God ostensibly draws power from them and their belief in him...   Do not forget that the laughing god only draws from those who support him: his personal cult the Harlequins. The harlequins have only been able to tell the story of the fall since about M30, so its certainly plausible that while the devotees of Khaine on their magic space rocks have been getting gradually snuffed out like so many little candles, his own influence and power within the warp has been growing.   Assuming the Slaanesh captured in Fantasy is the same Slaanesh from 40k (the joint universe theory), how is it that Demi-Gods can achieve what an actual God can not?   I've already said: The concept of a fragmented warp. The fantasy world, while existing within the 40k universe, exists within an inaccessible warp pocket, similar to The Black Library and Commorragh. Within such a place She Who Thirsts would be unable to draw power from their realm or their mortal worshipers in realspace. In short a mere demigod would certainly be able to capture and isolate a warp creature such as Slaanesh, provided they didn't have access to their host of believers who give them form.  The isolation of the Fantasy world literally weakens warp creatures who visit since there is so many less people to draw worship from.  Again tho, please stop saying ""can not"". Not trying simply does not imply can't.   my original question was simply how the Chaos Gods did not starve off after all the sentient races they drew power from were extinguished in the End Times?   Apparently they didn't all die off as a skaven god is now in their pantheon.  Additionally when people die their souls return to the warp, and usually join unto whatever diety the revere or are stolen by chaos gods. This is what gave Slaanesh their initial raw might. While technically having no ""worshippers"" they outright beat Khaine in single combat, running only on the Sugar high of just devouring the lions share of the Eldar empire for their incidental worship of them. This is identical to the end times scenario.   I don't think its accurate to say that worship is what they draw their power from, I think it's better to say it's what they are sustained by. Chaos gods immediate strength comes from their absorption of that energy in the warp, but they do not care if it is in the form of worship, or in the form of a particular sort of body count.   The latter simply leaves them without a next meal, whereby they starve, but they'll keep trucking for a little while before they die.  TL;DR: They didn't die off because Sigmar is an idiot and allowed the recreation of their food source."
Warhammer,3d98j8,amorrowlyday,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"Like I said, for all we know the End Times story arc could have taken place well before the ascension of mankind to the Imperium, featuring much weaker chaos gods, or could be in the future featuring much weaker chaos gods, etc.   There are a million reasons why it could happen, that don't require it taking place in the exact same time frame of the 40k universe - all we know for sure is that it happened after the fall of the eldar.

Warhammer,3d98j8,ChicagoCowboy,5,Wed Jul 15 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"Also it should be noted that the Eldar don't really try to go after Slaanesh - they are terrified of the parts of their souls that created her, and even invented the soul-stone system so they could compartmentalize their souls and avoid the type of thoughts/actions that she feeds off of. They don't seek to destroy Slaanesh, but to avoid her at all costs - she hungers for Eldar souls above all else."
Warhammer,3d98j8,ChicagoCowboy,3,Tue Jul 14 21:54:42 2015 UTC,"It also implies Slaanesh happened to be close enough and in a weakened enough state for them to pull it off.

He is carried on a palanquin by Skaven so innumerable that he's able to reach down and feed on handfuls of unlucky rat men even as they shuffle him about.   Edit - Of course, I'd love to see the Horned Rat have his hordes consume Slaanesh, with HR becoming embodied as a ravenous horde of rats. Being only a lesser god at the time of consuming the comatose Slaanesh, HR is driven insane by an all-consuming hunger. Nurgle is able to press the advantage and steal full control of HR's plague portfolio, giving Nurgle uncontested control as god of plague and death.

To decide to change that, just because, and replace one of the gods with a redundant version of another god, is completely utterly bonkers. It's completely insane and stupid.

The self-delusion would make sense too, since Skaven who openly worship gods other than the Horned Rat tend to get murdered for what's basically Skaven heresy. Really though, I think that the Clan Pestilens are just a holdover from the days before the Daemons got their own army book, when lesser Chaos Gods were basically something that happened when the essences of multiple major  Chaos Gods ""overlapped"" (the Horned Rat would likely be mostly Nurgle, plus bits of Tzeentch and possibly Slaanesh).

Warhammer,3ddbmy,Comet__,2,Wed Jul 15 17:41:32 2015 UTC,I played a demo of this in the local game store and it was pretty awesome. I agree that the default board setup is a likely culprit for making the game take longer.
Warhammer,3ddbmy,sqww,2,Wed Jul 15 16:01:00 2015 UTC,"I've played this game three times. I love it it's one of my favorite games to play. There is a lot of decision making, and seems (at least I think so) there is not enough turns to do everything you want. Build armies, attack, upgrade, tech up etc. The last game I played I was on the verge of winning by getting my last objective token. The other two players blocked me hard. So I decided to hang back and win by having the most planets and units. Chaos last two turns did a crazy all out offensive push against me. Even though his force was smaller he kept winning mainly because he had better combat cards where I built my Waaagh to have lots of troops and no so many combat card upgrades. I did end up winning by troop count,   Tl;dr It's a blast to play."
Warhammer,3ddbmy,bigstoney,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"It is great isn't it :). I lost one game by tying on my 4th objective with another player, matching planets, and losing by troops. The game is very well balanced and can some really exciting moments."

Warhammer,3d9qvr,intrepidsteve,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:36:08 2015 UTC,"It's actually turned into a lengthy process. I started with white spray, let it dry and washed the entire model black. I went through and did Leadbelcher (dark silver) on all areas I wanted to look like steel. After that I did a thin layer of Runefang (Light silver) and lightly washed it black again. After that wash coat dried I used ""Metallic Pearlescent White"" from Wal-Mart, super-thin rubbish coat on areas that would be exposed to the most light (chest plates, etc.). Use spot washing with black again to even the tones if necessary.  The result doesn't photograph well, but the armor literally gleams as you rotate it.  The Metallic Pearl White is an awesome paint you can pick up for around $2 at Wal-Mart. It's highly reflective and has a near-true pearl effect so it's worth trying."

In this image I used the drawing technique where you start off with a photo that you then manipulate and paint over until nothing of the original image remains, the reason for starting with a photo/image is that it lets you speed up work by having a good colour palette and light balance at the start that you then can enhance and/or alter to fit the image you are making.

Warhammer,3dcxu2,Darkjediben,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"With Krylon, you want their flat or ultra flat spray primers. I use Krylon's matte ultra flat primers and they seem to stick to plastic well enough, but are still easy enough to remove with Simple Green and a toothbrush. I'm not sure if this is the case, but I think the fusion paint might be self-etching, meaning it makes tiny holes in what it bonds to so it won't come off. I'm in no way certain, though- read the information on the can.  If you do choose to remove the paint, their website recommends mineral spirits for the Fusion line."
Warhammer,3d8wza,PandaMango,13,Tue Jul 14 12:38:00 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  Just need your thoughts on this conversion. In my fluff Humans who are militarily brilliant way into adulthood (far beyond the age where the transformation into a space marine would be possible) are pumped filled with steroids and genetically altered to become massive lumbering giants who excel at close combat. Lacking all the augmentations of a space marine, these guys become more like Ogryns in power.   To have the augmentations is considered a great honour, but it puts such a strain on the human body that a lifespan of no more than 15-20 years can be expected once undertaken, often seeing them thrown into the fiercest battles, their tales to become enshrined in the Hall of Legends deep within the fortresses of Hoplites territory.   The model is just for show and would have no rules In 40k, let me know your thoughts :)"

(just for clarity's sake this is a joke)  In truth though it's isn't really mentioned in the fluff completely, like for sisters of battle they talk about the holy trinity of weapons, (bolt, flame and melta) so it makes sense they would have pistol versions of them all. Whereas in blood angels they never directly mention why in the newer books, the only assumption I could make is back in the old 3rd edition book the blood angels were the assault space marine army and got pistol version of most special weapons, such as plasma, melta and flame so they could still use a chainsword.

Warhammer,3db5w3,_hei,3,Tue Jul 14 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. The errata says that an IC without the infiltrate special rule cannot join a squad of infiltrators at deployment(and vice versa), not that an IC without infiltrate cannot join a unit with infiltrate. This leads me to believe GW is saying if a unit plans on infiltrating (which you have to declare at deployment since it comes after normal deployment), you cannot have an IC without infiltrate be put with them and gain the benefits of infiltrating up the board and vice versa. So, in my opinion, if you declare Farsight and Shadowsun to both not be infiltrating and that they are instead be put in reserves, I think they can fuse into one unit at deployment."
Warhammer,3db5w3,sandvichborn,2,Tue Jul 14 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"Well you place the bodyguard in reserve.  Arriving vai Deep Strike.  You then say Farsight is joining this unit in reserve, and is arriving via Deep Strike.  At this point, you are still in the deployment phase, so you cannot say Shadowsun is joining the bodyguard in reserve to arrive via Deep Strike because she has the Infiltrate special rule and the others do not.  You are correct that the RAI was to prevent the O'vesa star from infiltrating, but RAW also prevents Infiltrators from joining non-infiltrators until the end of your first movement phase."
Warhammer,3db5w3,_hei,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"That's not what that says at all. That would only apply if this person was trying to use the inclusion of Shadowsun to infiltrate the Farsight bomb. So long as Shadowsun doesn't try to deploy as an infiltrator, it's fine."
Warhammer,3db5w3,Darkjediben,3,Wed Jul 15 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"It actually says:   An Independent Character without the Infiltrate special rule cannot join a unit of Infiltrators during deployment, and vice versa.    That means that Shadowsun cannot join a unit that is infiltrating nor may a non-infiltrating use her ability to infiltrate. You can still deploy them together as normal."
Warhammer,3db5w3,blackarmchair,2,Wed Jul 15 01:44:43 2015 UTC,"Oooh is that what that means?  I thought it meant a unit with Infiltrate, since they would be a ""unit of Infiltrators"".  I see what you mean."
Warhammer,3db5w3,_hei,2,Wed Jul 15 01:55:07 2015 UTC,Yeah it's worded kinda funny. It really just means that only models with the infiltrate rule (and their dedicated transports) are allowed to infiltrate.
Warhammer,3db5w3,blackarmchair,4,Wed Jul 15 02:30:23 2015 UTC,Interesting list but at 1500 points I'm confident I could table that army with most any balanced (not designed specifically to counter you) list from most armies.

Warhammer,3d93ho,The9thMan99,16,Tue Jul 14 13:38:41 2015 UTC,"there's a rumour doing the rounds claiming that a 'man from forgeworld' was repping the company, and claimed they'd be scrapping the old minis, which has caused a lot of this confusion. GW staff have confirmed that this is bullshit, but unfortunately rumour sites don't issue retractions (because if they did it would take up 80% of their content). It's been confirmed that every faction has an analogue in AoS - the beginnings of the warscrolls even point it out. It seems that models are going to continue production; if you look at the GW website they've had some temporary out of stocks for several fantasy products then turned new ones around pretty quickly, which indicates that they're still being manufactured. It looks like they're slowly running down their finecast and metal stocks, but that's been a trend for a while now and is nothing to worry about."
Warhammer,3d93ho,gribblewielder,6,Tue Jul 14 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"From what I heard talking to staff at WHW this weekend, the plan is to keep the current range available in the interim and phase them out as and when updated AoS versions are launched."
Warhammer,3d93ho,JimmyCarmine,7,Tue Jul 14 14:12:10 2015 UTC,Kind of like they do for most of their model ranges. Old kits get replaced by new kits.
Warhammer,3d93ho,CardBoardClover,4,Tue Jul 14 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"Though I think from here on out we might see the old kits getting replaced in a slightly different way. Where a box of Orcs in the past might have gotten replaced with a new box with better sculpts but relatively the same content, I think the new boxes we get from here on out will probably be much bigger departure from the boxes they are replacing. Like when we get some new ""Aelf"" kits they probably wont be a direct replacement for High Elf Spearmen or Dreadspears, there might well be one kit that replaces both or even something entirely new diverging from the generic idea of Elves."
Warhammer,3d93ho,turkeygiant,3,Wed Jul 15 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"of the old orcs and elves are replaced by new orruks and aelves that are roughly the same size and style then I'll be pretty happy after all.  kind of like the old old versions of dwarf models (5th edition or before) still are about the same size and style as the new ones released, but boy do those new ones look detailed and awesome"
Warhammer,3d93ho,biggles86,2,Wed Jul 15 12:40:42 2015 UTC,Rumors are they will follow the same design ideas bit have new flair. Take the new aos box. The basic khorne troops are pretty spot on for khorne marauders. Just with new ideas.
Warhammer,3d93ho,Zentdiam,2,Sat Jul 18 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"well if that is true, I would be very happy.  also I think i might stick those AoS models on squares.  at least the khorne side"
Warhammer,3d93ho,biggles86,2,Sat Jul 18 22:13:33 2015 UTC,Bases don't matter so whatever ya want
Warhammer,3d93ho,Zentdiam,4,Sun Jul 19 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"It's been confirmed that every faction has an analogue in AoS - the beginnings of the warscrolls even point it out.   I might be a biased/pessimistic Bretonnia player, but I will be highly surprised if BRetonnia receives any new models, outside of maybe some decals/head swap in a generic knight box. I think the same is true of the Tomb Kings. Every single faction has their own little blurb at the beginning of their compendiums, except for four: Bretonnia and Empire have the same, Tomb Kings and Vampire Counts have the same. But I feel since Nagash is still the leader, Tomb Kings will still exist in some fashion (high priests, mummies, be reflected in skelton legions, etc).  But Bretonnia, I don't see it happening. Especially after their fluff was completely shat all over in The End Times.  But like I said, maybe I'm just pessimistic."
Warhammer,3d93ho,rhoadesd20,3,Tue Jul 14 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure, Bretts had almos their entire range recast (albeit in resin) and they've got a pretty tasty set of rules. It's true that bretts are going to be thematically hard to fit in - noble knight dudes being pretty much the stormcast's deal - but hopefully GW distinguishes them as their own 'free people'/'red slayers'. I imagine they'll get a big shakeup but they'll be some aesthetic consistency."
Warhammer,3d93ho,gribblewielder,3,Tue Jul 14 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"I'm buying some sigmarines and actually making some squads with a bit more Bretonnian flavor (shaving off all the hammers, replacing most hammers with swords, etc). They are going to be my Honorbound of Montfort force :)"
Warhammer,3d93ho,rhoadesd20,2,Tue Jul 14 15:54:38 2015 UTC,You could just wait. The box of Liberators that comes out Sat has swords in them and they get rules for blades and greatblades.
Warhammer,3d93ho,AwareTheLegend,2,Tue Jul 14 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"I am buying a box of them, yup. But at $50 a box I'm sticking with just one for the time being, and converting some from the starter box."
Warhammer,3d93ho,rhoadesd20,2,Wed Jul 15 15:54:43 2015 UTC,Yeah makes sense. I want to grab a box of them but I don't know if I'm actually going to build a Stormcast Eternals army or not. Not to mention I'm already going to be shelling out $75 for the book already.
Warhammer,3d93ho,AwareTheLegend,2,Wed Jul 15 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"Lol, Tomb Kings are still using the same skeleton models from like 10 years ago. We ain't getting anything new.   I dug out one of my Skeletons from around 2006, and he fits into my unit from the 2015 box perfectly."
Warhammer,3d93ho,Aiyon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:32:59 2015 UTC,Running down their finecast? Wut?  Finecasts are still relatively new aren't they? I thought they'd be wanting to keep them a while longer.
Warhammer,3d93ho,Evil_Penguin918,3,Tue Jul 14 14:00:41 2015 UTC,"Finecast is generally pretty naff. While they've got better lately (seems to be using a better resin mix, not had any flaws, nice crisp edges etc) it's got very bad associations with hobbyists and they're moving to plastic clampacks for characters"
Warhammer,3d93ho,gribblewielder,2,Tue Jul 14 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"While it wasn't marketed as such, Finecast was only ever a temporary replacement for metal when the materials cost got too high."
Warhammer,3d93ho,JimmyCarmine,2,Tue Jul 14 14:10:37 2015 UTC,Ah makes sense. Thanks!
Warhammer,3d93ho,Evil_Penguin918,2,Tue Jul 14 16:38:20 2015 UTC,I wonder if they've found that they can make more money and better satisfy customers with plastic kits? Even for characters it's nice to have choices.
Warhammer,3d93ho,CardBoardClover,5,Tue Jul 14 16:48:46 2015 UTC,My local GW manager said that they're only going to discontinue models when they're replaced like on the previous schedule.
Warhammer,3d93ho,Portaljacker,2,Tue Jul 14 14:59:31 2015 UTC,There is never any official communication from GW.  You can expect metal models to diminish and either be discontinued or return in plastic. Models that fit the narrative may also be discontinued. The preference will be for new models.
Warhammer,3d93ho,apalehorse,2,Tue Jul 14 14:27:18 2015 UTC,My local gw store is no longer purchasing fantasy models. Once they go they go.
Warhammer,3d93ho,Sjarcade,4,Tue Jul 14 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"That sounds like just your store though - GW is still making and selling the full range for fantasy, until such time as the molds break down or the models are replaced by newer sculpts."
Warhammer,3d93ho,ChicagoCowboy,2,Tue Jul 14 15:05:35 2015 UTC,Well it's annoying because I can't find a free company box ANYWHERE. Was this discontinued a while ago?
Warhammer,3d93ho,Sjarcade,2,Tue Jul 14 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"http://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Empire-Free-Company  Free company were OOS for a little while on the UK site but came back a couple days ago.  quick edit: A fast glance between US and UK shows that the US site lists as OOS all the same things the UK store had OOS till a few days ago (Free company, knights, rocket battery etc). I'd expect them back on sale for the US in a few days or so."
Warhammer,3d93ho,UrbanJesus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:18:18 2015 UTC,Hopefully it gets to the states soon.
Warhammer,3d93ho,Sjarcade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"I'd assume so, I don't know if they manufacture in the states but if they don't and everything is made in nottingham then yeah, they just finished fresh batches of A LOT of out of stock stuff, not just empire but other armies too, on their website (I guess cos of renewed interest with AoS) so they have to fly/sail/launch from a giant cannon products over the pond to you."
Warhammer,3d93ho,UrbanJesus,2,Tue Jul 14 15:22:47 2015 UTC,I needs it now
Warhammer,3d93ho,Sjarcade,2,Tue Jul 14 19:03:07 2015 UTC,Just take solace in the fact that they aren't OOP and they'll show up eventually I guess :/

Warhammer,3d93ho,ChicagoCowboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"I am not an engineer, but keeping an injection or resin mold around is not that big of a deal. What I would expect them to do is to send less and less to retailers and only keep the old stock available via mail order."
Warhammer,3d93ho,gnoah0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"Iirc, at their headquarters in Nottingham you can have any mini on their catalog cast in 3 hours time. I remember reading about it on a White Dwarf some years ago, not sure if they still do it."

Warhammer,3d83m5,Deadparro7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:53 2015 UTC,If you're using the GW range I'd say use some runefang steel on the raised edges.
Warhammer,3d83m5,Deadparro7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:42:01 2015 UTC,Give it a gold hilt perhaps?

Warhammer,3d9c8f,El_Medved,5,Tue Jul 14 14:50:46 2015 UTC,"I think you did manage to pick out a few of the details well enough, but this looks like SUPER thick paint, and a lot of the colors are not well painted.  I would suggest thinning your paints, and especially when doing whites, use 2-4 very thin coats to get a smooth color.  Then after that consider doing some highlights / washes to get a finished look."

It's far less shiny in reality, and the paint looks a lot less thick in person, to me at least. I'm not a great photographer so I have no idea how to take a picture that would show that"
Warhammer,3d9c8f,eedden,2,Tue Jul 14 17:34:34 2015 UTC,Some quick and easy tips to get decent pictures:   Try to get a plain background for your mini (sheet of paper). If possible use multiple light sources to avoid shadows. Don't put light sources behind your mini (like the window). Try to make the mini fill as much of the picture as possible   These steps cost nothing but should improve your pictures quite a bit

Warhammer,3d8ax1,BalkonB,12,Tue Jul 14 08:00:22 2015 UTC,Build a list with tac marines.  Just cause it's not FTW doesn't mean it couldn't be pretty fun to give it a spin.
Warhammer,3d8ax1,BAWKSES_OF_CAWKSES,9,Tue Jul 14 09:03:33 2015 UTC,In the new codex there is a formation called the gladius strike force. I think you should check that out as it allows to to field quite a few standard marines and if you use it as a complete battle company you get the transports (including drop pods) for free.
Warhammer,3d8ax1,Thehudenator,3,Tue Jul 14 10:32:27 2015 UTC,"Holy Ravioli! I would need to gather Devastators (Read: More Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V marines from starters, just with heavy weapons) and one auxiliary choice (Termies) and that's all? I like it alot, thank you! :)"
Warhammer,3d8ax1,Thehudenator,4,Tue Jul 14 11:06:05 2015 UTC,Think you need a captin and a Chaplin with 2 squads of either assault marines or bikes but yeah that's about it. It's basically a whole battle company plus an auxiliary choice
Warhammer,3d8ax1,xKingNothingx,5,Tue Jul 14 14:30:18 2015 UTC,From what i've seen assault squad can be fielded without backpacks - So let's say i've got them covered :)

This army would use raven guard tactics and split each squad into combat squads giving you 24 5-man marine squads with the scout special rule. That was back with the previous marine book so I'm not sure how much the list has changed, but it's funny to think about using this list against power gamers to bog them down and over saturate the field with targets."
Warhammer,3d8ax1,psykolog,5,Tue Jul 14 13:06:59 2015 UTC,Paint every marine a different chapter. Have a rainbow parade.

Warhammer,3d44g9,gwarsh41,5,Mon Jul 13 13:57:10 2015 UTC,They are a bit small. I was building the new Devastator squad and it was basically like looking at the difference between true-scale and regular marines.  Are they slowly increasing the size of space marines? I know lore wise they should be a cm or two taller than Imperial Guard.

Bases don't matter anymore, you measure from points on the model, and we're still not sure if they're entirely removing square bases or just packing based the same way they do with Daemons.  Good thing about AoS is that it works well on large and small scales, and all armies have potential to be strong due to the lack of hard balancing."
Warhammer,3d44g9,Comet__,5,Mon Jul 13 12:36:19 2015 UTC,I don't get the argument that the game has more viable armies now. Couldn't you always just give the weaker army more points to play with?

Warhammer,3d44g9,Sheldonzilla,3,Mon Jul 13 15:11:07 2015 UTC,"Good thing about AoS is that it works well on large and small scales [...]   0_o  Edit: Very well. I don't believe it works well in either case. Every game I've played and battle report I've seen has been one of two varieties. 1) completely broken one sided affairs 2) super even close battles.  The reasons result one happens is because of rule structures that encourage 'how long can I last' scenarios. 300 was fun to watch, but imagine you had to play a game like that over and over and over again, hoping for a different result each time? To me there's nothing enjoyable about that.  Result two happens for two reasons. Players agree to a sort of competitive balance before hand. While sporting and gentlemanly, this has nothing to do with age of sigmar. Spirit of the game is how any proper gamer should approach a game. And when you have to make allowances to game rules themselves to have fun at all, it's not worth playing IMO. The other reason this type of game result happens is because even on top of players shoe-horning in rules to make it enjoyable, you can only go so far before it's not AoS anymore. And unless dice rolling is completely average and even, you will still get a lopsided result.  Army size doesn't do anything to mitigate any of these factors or results. In that sense I suppose you could say that it works well on large and small scales, but that's a pretty disingenuous description."

It's helped by the fact that A/O are canonically the shortest primarchs, being almost of a size with the tallest astartes of their legion like Pech.  If you've followed a style which involves filling out terminator legs with Greenstuff, would you suggest that this makes them too bulky to then greenstuff details (ie, a scale pattern plus trimmings) onto the front? Also, are the any particular pitfalls you ran into while putting them together?"

My main pitfalls with this style of Truescale were posing and having the patience for the GS to harden. For example, this Captain was a pig to get right. I spent up to a week working on a single mini in the end, before I drifted out of the hobby for a bit.  With the use of Termie legs and their bulkiness, I've always felt that Marines shoud be large and bulky, up to a point. However, that's down to your preferences."

Warhammer,3d44g9,xSPYXEx,7,Mon Jul 13 13:43:00 2015 UTC,Shooting terminators have their place. Load them up with some assault cannons and other heavy armaments and you have an anti infantry force that can be insanely tough to try to shoot back at.
Warhammer,3d44g9,Acora,7,Mon Jul 13 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"It's mostly because it's simply more points effective to have specialized units and the absurd amount of high strength AP2 is making them vulnerable. They're good at everything, they're the best at nothing."
Warhammer,3d44g9,I_Am_Become_Sex,3,Mon Jul 13 15:55:11 2015 UTC,"This is mostly true. If you were the kind of person who likes to deep strike their termies then regular ones would be advantageous. Or if you are against an army where your ap5 shooting is effective, they maybe able inflict more total wounds than just an assault squad.

From what I can see, my options are either going Grey Knights (since from what I understand, they're pretty much all psykers) or go with Thousand Sons and refluff everything in a less heretical light (Since, again from my understanding, all of the sergeants in their special squads are psykers). I'd rather them be more focused on the mind-bullet aspect of psychic powers than the buffing powers, even though I know the buffing powers are likely better."
Warhammer,3d44g9,Acora,5,Tue Jul 14 07:22:26 2015 UTC,"If you're not too worried about refluffing then thousand sons is a good bet, failing that the new Dark Angels Interomancy set is relatively devastating, so a DA successor chapter (or a custom chapter using DA rules) could work.

Grotesques are on 40mm bases as well. I haven't seen the stormfiends in person, but it looks like they are on 50mm square bases, and barely fit...so I imagine it might be tough to fit them on 40mm rounds.   According to GW, base size is no longer that important as long as you're not just being a complete jackass about it - so if you wanted to pop them on 50mm round bases instead, the extra 5mm in radius in each direction shouldn't effect the game in any significant way and would look damn cool."

I don't plan on rebasing my Marines since it isn't a huge change and I don't have any new bases but 40 to 60mm is a bit of a jump.

Warhammer,3d44g9,apalehorse,2,Mon Jul 13 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"The reason putting them on the new bases is key is because, unlike using a larger base than you're provided with, you actually get a lot of advantages for using a smaller base than you are provided with.   With the new broadsides on 60mm bases, they can't easily fit on levels of ruins, are more difficult to hide behind terrain features, easier to hit with blast weapons with their larger footprint...etc. 40mm bases allow for some shenanigans in those areas."

Warhammer,3d44g9,ArgonSyn,3,Mon Jul 13 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"That's the standard Load out for a broadside, pods and rail guns... you could replace the rail guns for more pods I believe"
Warhammer,3d44g9,gayezrealisgay,3,Mon Jul 13 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"The Broadsides come with Smart Missiles as a secondary weapon as standard. Those are St 5 AP 5, Range 30"" Heavy 4, Homing and Ignores cover.   Basically they tear the crap out of infantry and you can't hide from it. Unfortunately if you take the railguns you are probably shooting at armor so they are situational at best (You can ""upgrade"" them to plasma rifles.)  You can replace the standard Heavy Rail Rifles for High-yield Missile Pods, which are Str 7 AP 4, Range 36"" Heavy 4. They are made to glance down armor and blow up units with high toughness but poor armor save. Whether they are better than the rail guns is subject to debate, but the extra three shots is great if you tend to roll poorly with one shot all or nothing weapons.     I just thought I would clear that up, in case anybody was still confused."

Warhammer,3d44g9,thenurgler,4,Mon Jul 13 18:44:58 2015 UTC,I do not really have a play style. I've watched some other people play but due to inaccessibility to an army of my own I haven't done any playing. I've read the rulebook and codexes for a few of the factions but beyond that I don't have much experience

However, if you're not planning on playing competitively and just want to play casually then the rule of cool can apply, and CSM are pretty cool.  If you dislike painting/aren't very good at it then necrons are a nice army for that, as they're very easy to paint to an acceptable level."

Warhammer,3d44g9,Pale_Horse_forward,10,Tue Jul 14 07:33:33 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you got downvoted, but here's the rundown from the End Times campaign from last year, that advanced the storyline from what we knew in 1st-8th edition and what we now have in Age of Sigmar:   Nagash was brought back to life by sacrificing several major characters in the warhammer universe in a dark ritual Nagash laid waste to bretonnia entirely, basically killing the entire country. He also killed Settra and took compete control over undeath and the tomb kings as in times of old Nurgle, being the antithesis of Death (bringing forth life in the form of plague, disease, bacteria, insects etc), fought back against Nagash and the undead and invaded the Empire, utterly destroying most of the major cities in the country and killing a bunch of famous empire characters Meanwhile, the woods that the wood elves lived in were being destroyed by chaos, the word roots having been invaded Malaketh revealed himself to be the true heir to Anaerions throne - when he stepped into the fire of Anaerion originally, it was Morathi's foul sorcery that had burned him, not the fires; he takes his place at the head of the full combined armies of the elven kingdoms as the Phoenix King The vortex that kept magic limited to the portals in the north and south is destroyed, and daemons invade Ulthuan. The island is destroyed, and sinks into the ocean. The skaven reveal they have been building an enormous weapon in the bowls of the world, using it to pull Morslieb out of orbit and into Lustria, utterly destroying the land of the lizardmen The Lizardmen teleport away to safety into another realm The dwarven holds are more or less utterly destroyed by the orcs and ogres Archaeon marches forth from the chaos wastes to mark the final blow to the world, as the Everchosen of Chaos. He cuts a bloody swathe through the old world At the final hour, the Encarnites of the 8 winds of magic attempt a ritual to flush the magic from the world similar to what the elves did during the first war with Chaos in the time of the Elves, with the magic vortex that siphoned magic from the world but for the polar warp gate Archaon ruins the ritual, the entire world explodes, and everyone dies. The Old World is no more, and the last page of the End Times series sets up the Age of Sigmar - basically saying that this wasn't the only realm that the forces of good and chaos fight over, that there is still life and strength in the universe.   So basically, Sigmar as a God lives on in a different realm, and he and his demigod warriors (the Stormcast Eternals) continue to fight against Chaos. This is the first box set for Age of Sigmar - taking place in the realm of Azyr. Each of the army lists from WHFB still have rules for Age of Sigmar, and each more or less lives in their own realm in the universe - and from time to time are invaded or invade other realms, and battle ensues."
Warhammer,3d44g9,ripinpeppers,3,Tue Jul 14 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answers so far.  Would Malaketh becoming Phoenix King be the reason why we see Dark Elves, High Elves and Wood Elves in the grand alliance of Order?  Considering the Old World was destroyed should I be expecting the old armies to be replaced by new ones but with the old units still being playable due to the free warscrolls?"
Warhammer,3d44g9,Pale_Horse_forward,4,Wed Jul 15 11:40:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is exactly why the elves are more or less united and placed under the Order alliance. But, you can still play just dark elves, or just high elves, or whatever you like with the free warscrolls.   Its hard to say what we should expect, since this game and style of release is so new to us. I would imagine that GW will only stop selling the current range of models when they get around to replacing them with newer ones."
Warhammer,3d44g9,ripinpeppers,3,Wed Jul 15 13:25:19 2015 UTC,"I've been out of the loop as well and have the same question regarding Dark Elves. From what I remember, they should be on destruction's side?  But I did speak to my local GW manager, and the answer to your second question is yes. Slowly the armies will change appearance and name slightly to mirror their new counter parts in the new realms. All old units will still be applicable and usable, and are covered under the warscrolls all the same.   For example, an Elf Warrior might become a Aelf Warspear (guess work) and look different, but the rules will be the same for both. (As far as I've been led to believe)"
Warhammer,3d44g9,kenpachi1,3,Wed Jul 15 12:44:51 2015 UTC,"I'm really confused about the new chaos army in the box set. Could I use bloodthirsters or a daemon Prince in that army?

Warhammer,3d44g9,kenpachi1,3,Mon Jul 13 12:26:10 2015 UTC,"You can use any Warscrolls that are considered part of the Chaos faction, which is WoC, Daemons, Beastmen, the Goretide dudes (which are just WoC as far as I understand anyway), and I think even Skaven are part of Chaos faction now.

Warhammer,3d44g9,gwarsh41,2,Mon Jul 13 13:20:47 2015 UTC,I like Death Company. I'd always get a hammer or a fist for vehicles and doubling out FNP and incase you are counter assaulted. Worth it even to drop 2 power weapons for it. You want volume of attacks over AP anyway so it works. I wouldn't pay for ML2 or a combi on the squad. Just too expensive. Looks good.

Warhammer,3d44g9,J2oh,3,Mon Jul 13 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking of giving Age of Sigmar a go. Now, before I go any further - my 40K gaming group is a bit unconventional in that we never play 1v1, we either do 2v2 or 1v1v1.  With that in mind, I was thinking of getting the starter set and adding a small Empire force to the Stormcast Eternals, and cobbling together some Orc, goblin and troll minis that I use for D&D into something vaguely resembling an army to join the Khorne Bloodbound.  The main problem I've seen with the game (aside from balancing issues) is that it inevitably ends in one mushed melee, because of the lack of battle objectives. So I thought I'd come up with some kind of scenario, which will probably need some fine tuning - hence why I'm asking about it here.  The basic premise is that in the middle of the table (in different locations) are 3 informants, which are essentially objectives worth a random number of victory points (I was thinking between 1 and 3). You only find out how much the objective marker is worth once you have claimed it. Your opponent will not find out how much it is worth unless they then win it for themselves or the game ends.   The objective marker will attach itself to a unit unless that unit is destroyed, although you can pass it between allied units within, I dunno - 2""?  The thing is, I'm not sure how the game should end. I'm leaning towards a turn limit (5-7), and extra victory points available for destroying specific enemy units, to encourage fighting as well as objective grabbing.   A potential rule could be that you can permanently secure an objective by taking it to a board edge - but the unit carrying it is also removed from the battle permanently.  Anyway, those are some rough thoughts on how to make a more interesting game than last man standing always turns out to be. But I'm worried it might be a tad too convoluted for a first time game. Any thoughts/advice?"
Warhammer,3d44g9,RamenProfitable,3,Mon Jul 13 15:27:05 2015 UTC,"I would just sit tight. All the rumors point to GW making bank off this game through scenario books, which will provide Battlescrolls. These scrolls will guide you in building your army, and provide additional objectives.   Here is a link to the latest rumors, which say there are 110 pages of scenarios in the upcoming book. Personally, I would hold off buying miniatures until those come out."
Warhammer,3d44g9,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"Well I'm getting the starter set regardless, because I want the minis for a D&D campaign I'm running - I think the Stormcast Eternals make good Warforged models, and chaos-type warriors are always handy to have knocking about.  So AoS as a game is kind of secondary at this point. What I would like is to hold off on buying a scenario book until I've played it a bit, and more AoS stuff has been released so I can decide whether to invest in it."

Have each VIP be their own dude just chilling, until an army comes along and ""convinces"" them to come with. at that point, they are a model in that unit.  To put it in line with Sigmar, i'd give the VIPs their own warscrolls with a wound count, move, bravery, etc, and no attacks. They will cower instead xD this also gives your opponents the option of trying to shoot the VIPs instead of letting you capture them  :D  We ran something similar to this for a 40k scenario in trying to capture a city.

Warhammer,3d44g9,psykolog,3,Mon Jul 13 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"For removing the arms the only thing you need go do is figure out if they were attached with super glue or plastic cement.  Super glue is easy, in most cases the arm will pop right apart where it was glued.  Try popping the models in the freezer for a bit, this will cause the super glue join to be very brittle and will pop apart with less force.  Plastic cement is a pain cause it actually fuses the plastic together.   You can tell if you have plastic  emwnt if you try to pop the arm off and the arm breaks at a different spot then the join, at the elbow for example. For plastic cement you will have to use your hobby knife or jewelers saw to cut the arm off at the join.  Good luck!"

Warhammer,3d44g9,cleverlynamed,2,Mon Jul 13 20:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm looking to start a Lizardmen army since all my friends are playing 8th Ed. Fantasy (a great time to get in, I know.) My local shop has lots of models left, so there's no worry there. I bought a box of Saurus and I'm wondering what I should buy next? Are there some units that are must haves and are there some I should avoid buying?"
Warhammer,3d44g9,ChicagoCowboy,3,Mon Jul 13 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"To be fair, with AoS, there's much less of a ""those models gud those models badz"" since balance is mostly done through agreement with your opponent. Just buy those you think look coolest.  If you want to play 8th ed, giant packs of saurus, slanns, the stegosaurus thing and the salamanders/razordon are great while perhaps the two worst units in the army are both of those that are built out of the flying dino box."
Warhammer,3d44g9,cleverlynamed,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:14 2015 UTC,"Depends what kind of force you want to wield. Saurus Warriors are generally regarded as being too expensive to what they bring to the table, but if you enjoy them, then go for it! They are not a bad unit. A battalion box is a good buy if you plan to have a Slann. You get more Saurus (you need more than one box, I think 25-30 is a good amount), Cold One Cavalry, which you can use to convert your Scar-Vets on Cold Ones, plenty of Skinks (they are awesome!) and Temple Guard to protect the Slann. However, if you plan to go DinoDamage and/or low magic, the battalion box doesn't give you that much value.  I have mostly played without the Slann lately, so I would buy a box or two of Skinks, another box of Saurus, an Oldblood or a Scar-Vet for (or the new-ish Gor-Rok) to lead your Saurus block, a Dino of your choice (Carnosaurs are fun, Stegadons are great and versatile and Bastiladon with the crystal array give you great value, points wise. Don't build the Troglodon) and possibly Terradons or Ripperdactyls, if you like them. Kroxigors divide opinions, but I really like them. They are a bit squishy, but they are fast and have plenty of S7 attacks. Maybe you can find some metal Kroxies from eBay, as the current ones are Finecast.  Temple Guard are not worth it if you are not going to wield the Slann, Cold One Cavalry are rather pricy for what they bring (you should, however, search for a Scar-Vet on Cold One model, either from your store or eBay, as Scar-Vet Cowboys are rather awesome).  Also, be sure to join the Lustria Online, an awesome source for any Lizardmen player and home of super friendly people!  Sorry for the long rant, hopefully that helps."

I have a few questions, though.   I really want to play Lizzies because of their big Dinos. I have the army book in hand and I've found out that Carnosaurs are only an upgrade, not a unit choice. Am I misreading this or am I right?   Second question: DinoDamage, I figure it's an army about using Dinos (duh,) but could you explain to me how it's played and what units you usually field in such an army?   And lastly, why not Trogladons? I find them cool looking but I won't build them if they're just plain bad.  I saw Lustria Online while looking around one day. Looks cool!

Warhammer,3d44g9,cleverlynamed,2,Tue Jul 14 11:08:43 2015 UTC,"Glad you found it useful! Carnosaurs can only be wielded as mounts for Scar-Vets or Oldbloods. So they eat your Lords and Hero points. This is actually a good thing, since then you can fill your Special and Rare with more dinos! (Side note: I think there was a way to use only Carnosaurs in the Storm of Magic campaign, but I don't really know much about it).  DinoDamage is just a thing that popped into my head, I don't know if it's widely used. But yeah, it's all about maximizing the amount of dinosaurs on the battlefield. Monsters are generally regarded as rather weak (at least the ones that don't fly and don't have Ward saves, like our Dinos...), but since we can quite literally bring a dozen of them in a big-ish game, you start getting fun bonuses with them.   So essentially you have a fast-ish, hard hitting army, that wants to tear into the enemy as soon as possible. Unless you are facing a gunline army (Empire or Dwarves, for example), you enemy's war machines have to prioritize their shooting, and you should be able to get at least something into relative safety of melee.  Usually you have a Carnosaur or two, Bastiladon, one or two regular Stegadons and and Ancient Stegadon. That's already pretty hefty army. Though that is a full fledged DinoDamage. Just wielding a Carnosaur, Stegadon and a Bastiladon is pretty monster heavy. Lustria Online should have a tactics thread about this, as well.  Troglodon is an awesome model, I agree. It's also very weak in combat and it's buff ability is not as amazing as it could be. You pay pretty premium monster points and get a model that is easily tied up by chaff or shot to death by ranged units or magic. They really dropped the ball there, but Age of Sigmar made it pretty cool. I would build the Carnosaurs first. Maybe if you already have two of them, you could build the third one into a Troglodon."

Once you have that, borrow a copy of the rulebook from your friends. I believe that Fantasy 8 requires you to spend a certain maximum points on Lords/Heroes, Core and Special. So you'll want to look into getting a Slann or two for the Lords/Heroes slot, etc etc.  Can't give you any specifics really apart from that. I hear the big dinosaurs are great fun though :D"

Warhammer,3d44g9,PriceZombie,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"/u/cleverlynamed  Do not get 2 slann unless you plan on playing using the End Times rules for 50% lords and heroes - under normal circumstances, with the 25% L&H limit, you'll only be able to fit in 1 slann in a standard 2000 point game, since they run close to 500 points when kitted out properly.   If I were you I'd get the army book next, and a slann so you at least have a lord to bring to small battles.   Then it depends on how you want your army to run:   Skink Cloud - numerous 10 man skink skirmisher units, that excel at hit-and-run tactics to harry the foe with weight of numbers then retreating when they charge you, using your cold blooded LD 10 rerolls to get back in the fight each turn. This is a very competitive, if tough to play well, army list.  Saurus Blocks - numerous blocks of 18-24 saurus and temple guard blocks, with the intent to buff them with magic and grind your opponent down in combat. Very straight forward army to play.  Monster Mash - what it says on the tin. Grab 2-3 stegadons, a carnasaur Old Blood as your lord and a carnasaur scar vet as your hero, and add in terradon units to taste. Rush forward, and use your high S and high T to grind down the enemy. This is a fun army to play with, because dinosaurs, but is not very competitive - monsters are easily killed with magic (death and shadow lores) as well as any 100 point war machine in the game.

Warhammer,3d44g9,AngryRedDudes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"No worries!  For a 1000 point list, you're better off sticking with a basic slann build as your magic using lord level character, blocks of saurus as your minimum core, and then an ancient stegadon to round out the list. I tend to use the 2 blow pipe build on the ancient stegadon, so it can dish out a ton of poison shots when its in range of the enemy - 4d6 + 4 shots from the skinks up top, which can put a lot of wounds on an enemy unit!"

He reduces the strength of all melta, plasma, flamer and volkite weaponry hitting him by 50% rounded down, how does this affect him when he has joined a unit? – My take: If he is at the front of the squad the shots are targeting him and are therefore rounded down, regardless I am still not sure as he is within the squad so they still target him whether he is at the front or not.  He has a re-rollable adamantium will roll. Assuming he stops 2/4 warp charges with 5 dice can he now reroll only the unsuccessful rolls or does he re-roll the entire roll? - My take: He Re-rolls all fails but not the successful ones similar to twin linked shots.

And are Sslyth  / Drazhar viable at that point level ?  I absolutely love the model.  Thanks in advance!"
Warhammer,3d44g9,Archer5100,3,Thu Jul 16 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"/u/ChicagoCowboy, could you help?"
Warhammer,3d44g9,DTempest,3,Fri Jul 17 21:15:56 2015 UTC,"/u/ReptilicusTotalWar - I've had my coffee, so here we go!  First, let me start by saying welcome to the underworld of Commoragh, its a great place to be - Dark Eldar have some of the best models that GW has produced in my opinion, and some of the best fluff and background in the game. They have a lot of depth to their story - they're no longer just ""eldar but with spikes"" - they're a tortured, complicated race trying to find meaning and salvation for their souls the only way they know how.   Now, to answer your questions:   At 750, Sslyth are absolutely viable - in fact they tend to be better at lower points levels, because their T5 is harder to counter than when your opponent can bring all the fun toys to the table. They make a great retinue for your archon, and give the unit majority toughness 5 for next to nothing, which is huge for an overall fragile army of T3 and AV10 units. They're no slouch at shooting or combat either - can pretty much do it all. Drazhar on the other hand...not so much. He's hardly viable at any points level frankly, he's just so damned expensive for what he can do. Coming from a fantasy background as well, I'm used to characters being 300-500 points and well worth their cost - but in 40k, the idea behind list building should be to keep everything as cheap as possible while giving it just enough tools to do the job you need it to. Drazhar, as cool as his fluff is (and some of the converted models people have made of him through the years ), just doesn't add much to the army on the tabletop. As far as pros and cons of the army are concerned - they are the ultimate glass hammer. They hit like a TON of bricks when played properly - everything in the army can be armed with either a S8 AP2 Lance weapon or a volume of fire Poison weapon that always wounds on a 4+. What that means is, unlike other armies in the game, every single unit in our army list is effective in game, every game - either vs infantry/monsters (poison) or vehicles and elite infantry (Lance weapons). Everything in our army list is also relatively cheap - most units are around 120-150 points total to be effective at their job, which allows us to bring a ton of units to the table top - spamming (I prefer to call it ""building in redundancy"" ;) ) units like Warriors in Venoms and Raiders, Scourges, Ravagers, Beast Packs, Jetbikes, and Trueborn will allow you to bring a lot of pain.  The flip side of that, the ""glass"" part of glass hammer, is that we are extremely fragile - toughness 3 and armor 10 on our units means that we die to almost everything in the game - and quickly - unless you use the terrain around you and board control to strike your opponent precisely when and where you need to to cripple his army. That aspect makes it a little bit tricker to play effectively, compared to something like Space Marines which is more or less idiot proof - but that's also the fun of the army! When you win a game with Dark Eldar, its usually a masterful strategy and proper target priority that did it for you, and there's no better feeling.    Alright now on the subject of 750 point builds - what aspect of the army do you like the most? What are you going for in your list? Do you prefer to bring a lot of smaller units to overwhelm the opponent with targets, or a smaller number of units that can bring overwhelming firepower? Do you prefer a list that relies on going first to cripple the enemy, or do you want to have a more ""all comers"" list? I'll happily provide you a few ideas once I can narrow it down!  Oh, and are there any models that you absolutely want to use? I can make sure I include the best practices for bringing and using them in game."

Warhammer,3d61dv,AgeOfSkubmar,12,Mon Jul 13 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting, mimics my general thoughts. Just a few of my own experiences to add:  The most important stats are wounds, movement and damage. Number of attacks can be buffed. Saves can be neutralised fairly effectively, and it was my experience that attacks are rarely in short supply - at times, the game almost seems excessively deadly. You need to avoid mosh pits fights. You need to do a lot of damage. If you can buff a unit's attacks, then it either needs to be used on a large unit or on one with a lot of damage. 2 damage doesn't seem as significant on paper as it is - you are basically killing twice as much.  Special rules are the key to winning. People just love to throw the term synergy around in war games. It really is true here - characters throw out some insane buffs, and the person who can most effectively use them WILL win. Knights of the realm, on paper, don't seem too scary. 2 wounds, 3 attacks total looks pretty average. However, when they are buffed with the fay enchantress and you read their rules, all of a sudden they're hitting you automatically with 2 attacks each, wounding on 3+, saving on 3+, etc. It is really shocking how effective some things can be. Similarly, a dwarf grudge thrower might look amazing in theory, throwing out 2 rocks which can re roll to hit and wound from a long distance, even without line of sight. However, if you can kill the engineer next to it, or reduce the crew, it becomes really very mediocre indeed.  There are 4 types of units: fast, big, missile, or buffers. Probably the biggest change from fantasy. In fantasy, having lots of MSU was positively an advantage - because of the old initiative system, the order of combat resolution was far less important. In Age of Sigmar, large units are amazing because it all activates at once, meaning you can hit multiple units and kill them before they get to strike. MSU controls movement, but you can do similar with actually useful units. Missile units are something. I can only imagine that people who complain about battles degenerating into one large fight in the middle never had missiles. Now it's true that you can engage in combat with missile units and still fight - however, this puts them at risk of death. While out of combat, they are just insane, maybe even OP - you can just fire and fire and fire, and nothing stops you. Brettonian bowmen, as are rattling guns, organ guns and helblasters- you must kill these units, as otherwise they will turn the tide of every combat. This is why you need fast units as well, though they have the unique advantage of doing hammer and anvil attacks. I think I've said enough about buffing units.  The rules are simple - the game is not. I may get hate for this, but I didn't see much difference in the skill required to play compared to 40k or fantasy. There, I said it. The core things you do are all the same - you want to move to control your opponent, get into advantageous fights and win by making better use of your army. If you can find a way to balance armies, you get just as good a game as before. It doesn't look quite as cool as moving around blocks IMO, but then you also don't lose whole units to dwellers, or purple sun, and you still need to restrict war machines etc. I wish there was some method of making fairer armies.  Gun lines are still anti fun. Maybe even worse. Think that empire gun line was bad before? Well, they are both better and worse now. See, now, you can get absolutely wrecked if they go second and then get first for the next turn. You effectively fight 2 combat rounds whilst they fight 4 - if you can even get to them. On the other hand, if you do the same and get initiative, these units are pretty much universally awful in combat. As a result, gun lines are either almost totally dead immediately, or you are. Not fun. Don't even think of fighting Skaven ones, which are even more of a flip flop, and storm fiends with rattling cannons are ridiculous in general.  Your big tough unit is not as big or tough as you think. Got a 12 wound Nagash? It can and will die to missiles, and probably will contribute most by summoning more units. Wonderful warsphinx? It will die to a large unit. That's not to say they won't do a lot of damage - in fact, they are some of the better things in the new rules - they are just not as invincible as they look on paper. You might not die to auto hit cannons as easily any more, but you might find yourself dying to bows instead.  On the whole, I've been pleasantly surprised. If you come into it with the mindset that it is a whole new game and you need synergy rather than durability+magic, it is quite enjoyable. I'm excited for the future of it, and I hope guidelines for balanced armies are out soon. The starter has made it onto my shelf of general board games to play even, I think it's that good. There are many flaws for sure, but it's not the droolfest I was led to believe at all."

Warhammer,3d61dv,BattleSneeze,4,Tue Jul 14 11:16:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the removal of points poses a problem for competitive play, but for friendly games, it's great. Whenever I used to make lists, I could never have my army as wysiwyg. I was always tweaking things to fit our point total. Now I can just play and not worry about all the little things. I find most of the fun in the strategies utilizing the special rules. The throwing dice part is a mixed bag."
Warhammer,3d61dv,UnknownAspect,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great point. As I've said before, without having to shoehorn things in to fit the Army theme you want, you can make it work. Also, things that may have been terrible to use that I thought looked cool, I can now take and not feel like I'm hamstringing my points."
Warhammer,3d61dv,Krushnieva,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:40 2015 UTC,I've got an empire gunline. Have had a couple of games with it's felt pisstakingly strong; I've been able to get them down to 2+ to hit and wound with -1 rend. it's naaaasty.
Warhammer,3d61dv,gribblewielder,2,Tue Jul 14 14:39:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, you can do better. Take handgunners in the state troop detachment. Stand still and have 20 models, that's 3+ to hit. In the detachment, that's 2+ to hit. Use the general's command ability, and suddenly the gunline is firing 20 auto hitting, wounding on 2+ shots which have -1 rend. Then, if charged with a piper in the unit, you fire again hitting on 2+ (for 20 models, detachment and general ability) and wounding on 2+. I don't think you can get crossbowmen close, but they are able to fire 40 shots hitting on 2+, wounding on 3+ from further away, then 20 more if charged, so there's that.  I do kinda feel like that's balanced compared to some of the other units, but I have a hard time explaining why anyone would ever even consider melee only units. Seems like GW always underestimates shooting. Certainly, a decently constructed empire gun line of ~100 wounds will murder most stuff with relative ease. Cinematic, but not fun to face unless your opponent gives you a higher model count. Then again, with infinite skeleton armies, ogres that can just murder things by looking at them (especially Thundertusks who literally have a ""on 2+, take 6 mortal wounds attack from 18"") and other such shenanigans, I'm not sure I can reasonably call it unfair."
Warhammer,3d61dv,GaussMouse,4,Tue Jul 14 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"Out of Curiosity, do you think you'll play a game with the rules 100% as written, without house ruling, to see how it goes?"
Warhammer,3d61dv,Veritor,2,Mon Jul 13 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"Never 100% RAW, if only because that allows archers to shoot at the people they are meant to be fighting hand-to-hand. And while that would be an advantage to my armies, it makes zero physical sense."
Warhammer,3d61dv,UnknownAspect,3,Mon Jul 13 23:05:27 2015 UTC,I believe this rule is going to be somewhat taken into consideration with the new model range. You should watch the battle report using the new AoS box set that was posted a day or two ago. The shooting into and out of combat seemed reasonable.
Warhammer,3d61dv,Krushnieva,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:31:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think a lot of the intent by the game is to allow for people to tweak it to their group's personal needs. It does complicate things when different groups try to play together, but overall, I like more ability to make those decisions with my friends as opposed to some arbitrary rules that we end up tweaking anyway."
Warhammer,3d61dv,makeskidskill,8,Thu Jul 16 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"You saw ""small tweaks to rules"" and the follow that with models in combat can't shoot and that seems like, from what I've read, a huge tweak to the rules.  Could you elaborate?"
Warhammer,3d61dv,UnknownAspect,4,Mon Jul 13 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"elaborate   That was the extent of our changes, and it seems pretty logical to me. GW has made that rule change in the unofficial competitive ruleset that's been floating around."

Warhammer,3d61dv,Rrrrrabbit,2,Tue Jul 14 06:11:22 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with shooting into combat, just not by the unit that's already engaged (and supposedly fighting for their lives with hand weapons, and presumably too busy to draw a bow)"

Warhammer,3d61dv,cbsa82,3,Tue Jul 14 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"As a player of The Hobbit SBG random turn order is great fun and I never understood how Fantasy and 40k didn't have it, it just adds another layer unpredictability and another level of strategy. Do you wanna go for broke hoping to get two turns in a row or do you hold back just in case? So much fun to be had!"
Warhammer,3d61dv,Tigirus_Arius,4,Tue Jul 14 01:09:09 2015 UTC,"All very excellent points, however one huge thing I've noticed to random turns is that it adds incredible value to going second on the first turn. Going second means after your opponent has gone first and most likely just moved up a shot a bit (unless they got fast cav) you have the chance of going twice and getting a huge lead. The worst case scenario of going second is that you just proceed in normal order if your opponent wins the roll-off.  Random turns greatly change the dynamic and are still pretty fair, I like that they at least bring some thought to turn order unlike in 40k where 90% of the time there is no downside to going first."

The longer version:  I had ~100 pots of GW paint that were packed away with my supplies three years ago.  Also in there were some Vallejo Model Air, Vallejo Model Colour, and a few Reaper Master Series.  I had started moving off of the GW paints because - mostly - of the paint pots.  It's a pain in the ass to mix colors and get consistent ratios with GW paints.  Anyways after unpacking the GW paints were all destroyed - well some of the washes and all of the inks survived - but the rest of the GW were done for.  All of the dropper bottle paints were fine though.  Out of the dropper bottle paints I had previously purchased I enjoyed the RMS the most so that's what I bought, along with the GW foundation paint kit because I do like those also.  Anyways those models were painted almost exclusively with HD or high pigment paints.  I plan to grow my collection of colors with the RMS - 1) because of the bottles and 2) because of the triads."

Khorne was also the god of martial honour and giving a fair fight to a worthy opponent, while Nurgle was the god of growth and life, his dark side being the slow corrosion that ended that life and the hopelessness that came with it.  As the editions went on, the 'good' sides of the Chaos Gods got left by the wayside and only their evil side remained, though Nurgle is still depicted as rather friendly."

I think Slaanesh is rarely shown because the usually associated sexual stuff that makes it difficult to market it towards younger audiences.

Slaanesh was actually GW's second most-supported Chaos God until fairly recently though (although it was only really possible after they started downplaying the sexual stuff in the models a bit).  It's only in the last few years that the number of Nurgle kits has started to increase, whereas Slaanesh made up the bulk of God-aligned, non-Khorne Chaos releases before then.  In terms of modeling and player popularity though, I think you're right on the money."

Nurgle being second most-loved may be due to his popularity among collectors/players, since a tabletop-quality Nurgle force is pretty easy to convert and paint (an expert-quality one is probably one of the more ambitious projects a Warhammer/40K collector could undertake, but most people don't paint/model at that level).  To be fair though, Nurgle being second most popular - at least in terms of the amount of GW releases - is a relatively recent thing.  If you look back, you'll see that Slaanesh got a lot more official support than Nurgle did until a couple of years ago, when GW started increasing the number of Nurgle kits all of a sudden."

Tentative name, something along the line of ""Changelings""  Short version, they're a fleet based chapter who got lost in the warp for an unknown amount of time. In the process, the Chapter Master was slain, along with many of our Librarians. An unknown amount of time has passed since this event, and what's left of the chapter is a confused group of marines with lost and inconsistent history, meaning they aren't sure who they're successors of. They seem to have a Melanchromic organ defect, causing their skin to be pale so many think they come from the Raven Guard, yet there are Dreadnoughts who insist we belong to other chapters. Captain Jaden Telarius has taken the reigns as leader, and insists that they must not focus on the past, but instead study the teachings of all the most successful chapters and how to fight like them. The Tactical Marines are learning from the Ultramarines, the Assault Squads from the Raven Guard and Blood Angels, the Devastators from the Imperial Fists, etc.  The confusion and mystery behind them has caused many conflicts with other Imperial forces, many assuming that we are heretics from the warp, since they remind many of the Emperor's Children. The Chaplains have been vigilant in ensuring that no corruption from the warp remains in our chapter and are usually in the front lines of most of our battles.  Since they are in a state of rebuilding, they harvest any gene seed organs they can find, an idea the apothecaries learned from the Raven Guard. They are currently on a voyage to Terra, helping Imperial planets on the way, in order to prove their loyalty to the emperor, while many men still wish to learn their past once they arrive."

Warhammer,3d2vjt,apalehorse,4,Mon Jul 13 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"It's almost funny, the contrast between your great helmets and your FREAKING KILLER AMAZING skin tones. Those heads look better than half of the Games Workshop tactical marines. I love your highlighting, it looks so real."
Warhammer,3d2vjt,Imanitzsu,4,Mon Jul 13 03:43:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) these are the first models I've painted so that means a lot (the middle marine in the final pic was the first). The skin is just ushabti bone, reikland flesh shade, and ushabti bone again but carefully applied. The GW youtube tutorials really helped. I found the faces naturally added depth to themselves while the helmets are harder to do, which is why I like doing the contrasting colors to try and make them look interesting anyways."
Warhammer,3d2vjt,Zombieburger,2,Mon Jul 13 03:53:13 2015 UTC,"They look really great for first models, have you tried thinning your paints? I normally go 1/3 water (or paint thinner/medium or whatever) to 2/3 paint for layering. The edge highlights look like you had a little too much paint on the brush. Very little paint is needed for crisp edges, and if you use too little you can always work up from there. Also, some lines on the inside of the model just aren't worth highlighting, like the gaps in the armour on the left and forward-most marine in picture #5. I don't really bother highlighting lines such as those because they are barely ever visible, and are a complete and royal pain in the ass to get right.  EDIT: I'm stealing your skin tone technique, I'll make a post in a few weeks when I get some tactical marines."
Warhammer,3d2vjt,eclipse650,2,Mon Jul 13 04:01:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I use a wet pallet and thin it out a lot. The edges are the thinnest part of the paint job, it's just that even if I don't thin down that emperor's children pink, it seems to be a little runny so it's hard to control, since I switched brushes it got a little easier (the slightly cleaner looking ones are more recently painted) but because it acts that way I've gone for a rough look anyways, at table height it looks more like scuff marks than just highlights."
Warhammer,3d4ay4,valhalle,2,Mon Jul 13 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"The paint is way too glossy. Make sure you have a flat primer not satin or gloss. The paint is a bit thick and could be thinned down quite a bit. A wash of reikland fleshshade and agrax earthshade are needed for the clothes and skin. There isnt much stray paint on unwanted parts so thats good. Overall this is on the low-medium end of tabletop quality and it certainly isnt bad.   Edit:i believe you may have washed it, but you used so much that it ended up glossy. When you wash your mini you need to retouch every surface with your previous color so it looks more natural"
Warhammer,3d4ay4,gaysok95,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:18:59 2015 UTC,I used the reikland on leather part of the armor but I am still new to how to apply it well to have the best results. Do I apply the shade to the entire minature or just the certain areas I want to highlight? Which brush would be the best for this? Keep in mind this is like my 2nd unit I painted.
Warhammer,3d4ay4,gaysok95,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:50:22 2015 UTC,"So I would advise not to use reikland on the clothing and instead use nuln oil or preferrably agrax earthshade. There are 2 wash methods. 1 is to use a detail brush and only get crevices. This method is the cleanest and GW tutorials have this method. The other is to wash the whole model. After washing the model you go back on top of it with the coat previous to it and clean up the model, but leave the wash in the recesses. When you wash, make suee to push the wash away from the big flat surfaces and towards crevices instead. Otherwise you will get these big stains on flat parts of clothing."
Warhammer,3d4ay4,Cushions,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:32:41 2015 UTC,Actually Citadel wash sometimes turns out glossy. Happened with a few of my Lizardmen.  The answer is to shake it VERY well before use.
Warhammer,3d4ay4,BrokerKingdoms,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"OP, did you use a dip method?  All you need now is a matte finish spray to cut the gloss and you're golden. It's not pretty but it's tabletop quality!"
Warhammer,3d4ay4,PattrimCauthon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"Oh that's where that model is from, I run some as High Elf Shadow Warriors, couldn't remember where I got the models from, I put some High Elf heads with helmets on mine though. I like the colors though, but as the other guy said the glossy-ness needs to be addressed to make em look better, a whole unit like that would reflect a lot and look pretty odd on the table"
Warhammer,3d4ay4,PattrimCauthon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:07:13 2015 UTC,Would spraying them with something matte solve the issue or is the problem with me using too thick paint?

Warhammer,3d4ay4,DisgruntledBadger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"The problem of glossyness can be caused by numerous things, too much wash/glaze, not very well mixed paints, are you giving them a good shake? Also you need to thin your paints as it looks thick."
Warhammer,3d43p4,Oberon_Outlaw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:49:48 2015 UTC,Did you thin your paints
Warhammer,3d43p4,YashaMadar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:08:06 2015 UTC,"Nah, not on this guy, I did a lot of the painting on him before figuring out that I should be watering them down, and I'm happy enough that I don't really want to start again on him. I think..."

Warhammer,3d29ps,Kialae,3,Mon Jul 13 03:34:41 2015 UTC,can i tell you tho painting well is so stressful to me. i put 50 hours into my HQ/centerpiece and then im burnt out for the army and just edge highlight like a chump... this prob took him between 15-30 hours since i cant see very close and it is mainly the one color. is that worth the time to you?
Warhammer,3d29ps,eosgreen,3,Mon Jul 13 05:17:38 2015 UTC,Absolutely gorgeous
Warhammer,3d29ps,Gamer_ely,3,Mon Jul 13 03:15:23 2015 UTC,good stuff. care to share your recipe for the blue/black cloth? i assume this is on CMON
Warhammer,3d29ps,eosgreen,2,Mon Jul 13 03:19:40 2015 UTC,"It is, it's still awaiting approval to be public - http://www.coolminiornot.com/382873  I used just three colors, black, a dark blue, and an almost white blue color. I can't remember the names, i think I may have them in a comment on a previous WIP post of this. Full basecoat of black, built up highlights with the dark blue, then the extreme highlights with the light blue. I think the best technique to explain how I did the blues blending is similar to Painting Buddha Age of Sigmar painting video."
Warhammer,3d29ps,eosgreen,2,Mon Jul 13 03:57:45 2015 UTC,so basically a glaze-ish highlighting method? voted on it btw and if you can remember the recipe for that and possibly that blade id love to know. i'm always trying out new colors to add in the bag of tricks. GJ my dude
Warhammer,3d29ps,eosgreen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yep, pretty much a glaze-ish technique. Very watered down, and I built up the dark blue to a bright enough highlight. The white-blue was a bit harder, either I'm still learning glazing or something as drastic of a change from dark blue to a near white blue is harder to do. I had to mix the dark and light blues and transition the highlights to get a better blending.  As for the blade, I basecoated with a regular green then built up with a neon green paint to get a smooth bright color. The dark green spots were glazed as well using Secret Weapon Algae wash."
Warhammer,3d29ps,Hellblade87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"ah so you are new to glaze style painting? I cant tell what level you are since the pics are not super close up but some advice. when you glaze, its ONLY (mostly) shading. I typically have 7 highly watered down shades of a color im blending. Ill start with the 2nd or 3rd highest and then shade DOWN. your base color when you glaze isn't the midtone but rather what you want to almost end up at. you will find its MUCH easier to paint the white and then shade down around it with small touch ups at the transition rather than highlighting up from a midtone or even darker.   when you were struggling with the white was there tidemarks/or build up at the edges of the paint? generally with a glaze people use too much water originally. Think of the paint as oil and water. the paint rests on the top of the water so if you use TOO much it has trouble sticking to the surface and falls to the edges. try removing most of the paint/water similar to a drybrush and see how that helps"
Warhammer,3d29ps,SwankNasT,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not really new to glaze style painting, I think it's just I do a bit of a mix of a variety of painting techniques. Rather it would seem it's a mix of glaze techniques and the ""loaded brush"" technique illustrated in Painting Buddha's Age of Sigmar videos. You can glaze highlights on, but the biggest trouble is getting the highlights at a good enough transition. My mistake was attempting to glaze white on black when I should have blended a bit more of the midtones in between. I had no tidemarks, it's just the blend was too stark between the black and the white. With closer relations between values in the paint it's easier to hide the blends."
Warhammer,3d29ps,Cragboar,3,Mon Jul 13 17:12:37 2015 UTC,Beautiful..
Warhammer,3d29ps,Jloother,2,Mon Jul 13 03:30:48 2015 UTC,Just eyed mine last night. Going to have to save this for inspiration. Great looking model!
Warhammer,3d29ps,ViperXeon,2,Mon Jul 13 03:43:26 2015 UTC,I want my Black Templars to have that colour amour... it's exactly what I was imagining.
Warhammer,3d29ps,ViperXeon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"Really like the hair, what's your secret? If you don't mind sharing :)"
Warhammer,3d29ps,ViperXeon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:19:29 2015 UTC,"I basecoated with P3 Sanguine, and then glazed red using a filbert brush. I find reds are so transparent that they're almost the easiest to glaze with. Water it down just a little bit, have a small bit of red paint on your brush and then just pull it along on the surface. If you're using a standard round brush, you'll want the body of the bristles moist, the paint just at the tip and then you'll brush the paint on more on the side of the bristles than using the tip of the brush. After that, I built up with a bit more brighter reds, used some orange to bring out some highlights and then brought the colors together a bit by glazing thinly with some orange and yellow washes by Secret Weapon. Finished it up with line highlights built up from a firey orange to yellows."
Warhammer,3d5omd,tsmango,6,Mon Jul 13 18:51:27 2015 UTC,"Be careful with spray paint not meant for plastics, it will melt the models. I also found metallic sprays spray thick and pool, covering details... ESPECIALLY chrome or high-reflective sprays.  If you don't have an airbrush, to me GW sprays are worth their cost. I have hundreds of dollars in models, not worth ruining them for $10 spray paint."
Warhammer,3d5omd,fat_over_lean,2,Mon Jul 13 21:01:37 2015 UTC,I forget the maker but look up Old Gold.
Warhammer,3d5omd,Casual_Salmon,3,Mon Jul 13 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"Vallejo is the maker. It's part of their liquid gold set. It isn't a spray paint like OP needs, but it definitely is the best gold paint you can get."
Warhammer,3d5omd,Peredus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"Oh shoot, thanks for the correction. The end result of their gold lines really is the best I've seen. So rich"
Warhammer,3d5omd,Casual_Salmon,2,Tue Jul 14 02:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'm all for Krylon or rustoleum to save some cash in the primer department, but I usually only get Black/White/Grey from those. Metallic primers are usually a good way to completely fuck up a miniature and destroy its details and the smooth finish doesn't hold shades or washes worth a damn.   Yes, Citadel's new gold primer covers really nicely, but it'll be a cold day in hell when I'd pay $28 for a can.   This is just my opinion, but if you're set on spraying gold, I'd just go snag some Vallejo Air and an airbrush. They're fantastic and versatile, and you save a ton of money when you want to spray a different color ($18 can of citadel color vs. $4 bottle of paint that you can spray or brush? Bottles all day)."
Warhammer,3d5omd,pkp_674,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:08:57 2015 UTC,See if kryon or rustolium have plastics gold spray. They are a quality paint companies.

Be it temperatures or just the way the paint works you do NOT want to be ruining your lovely new models...."
Warhammer,3d1mjj,BaconWarrior,16,Sun Jul 12 19:58:13 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I was waiting for. Really works well for black templar. Did you see that there is a model that makes a perfect emperors champion?

Warhammer,3d1mjj,sinndogg2,0,Sun Jul 12 20:20:10 2015 UTC,The model is bigger than a space marine though.  Would work as a primarch or Sigismund.
Warhammer,3d1mjj,IronHyena,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about that.  Stormcasts are about as tall as Terminators, which are more bulkier than they are tall, compared with regular power armour Marines.  Plus, you could just say that he's an abnormally large Marine, like Alexis Polux in 30K, or Pasanius Lysane in the Ultramarines series (the latter of whom needed to have a hybrid suit built for him from a mixture of power armour and Terminator armour, since regular PA was too small).  Also, Sigismund recently got himself an awesome model, so why would you not use that?"

Warhammer,3d1mjj,Warzonekilla,2,Mon Jul 13 04:22:00 2015 UTC,"I, too, amn't particularly gone on the face Forge World gave him, particularly since the way the wiki described him gave the impression of a more handsome man rather than a bald old man.   ...his hair a dark blonde with a patrician face that echoed the same austere lines as his liege lord, Rogal Dorn. His face was only marred by a scar from under his right eye that ran down his cheek all the way to his jawline. His eyes were coloured a bright, sapphire blue that matched the colour of the ocean.    http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Sigismund  What I plan to do if/when I get around to getting Black Templars is use one of the helmets from the Imperial Fists Templar Brethren set, and paint Sigismund in black and white Templar colours so that the model works in both 30k and 40k, as Sigismund at the Battle of Terra and an anonymous Emperor's Champion, respectively."

We as warhammer fans spend a great deal of time collecting and painting the miniatures. Depending on how new of a player you are, or how often you play games, this could exceed the amount of time you spend playing.   For example i have High Elves for fantasy, and Space Marines for 40k. For my lists i have spent time pondering my purchases and figuring out what would suit my army, both on and off the battlefield. I have named all of my heroes and units, and have backstories for my armies. In 40k i run my own chapter, and have my own color scheme.   I would be pretty upset if someone banned my big griffon, or a key player in one of my more thematic army builds. This to me destroys the feeling of building your own army."

Warhammer,3d4sp5,Avagantamos101,2,Mon Jul 13 15:01:47 2015 UTC,"For one if your color scheme is anything light always start with a white primer. i assume you started with something OTHER maybe blue? and the blue was macgrag blue from GW (however thats spelled)  thin - your - paints. practice thinning and putting down multiple layers. your colors will look better with a solid color. white takes FOREVER to get solid and most people stay away from it ESPECIALLY new painters   blue and white, its a good combo but imo its a higher level color scheme. for example white with blue shading on your vehicle would be best represented with blue in the inward curvature of the engines where light would be the brightest. As it stands just in the cracks the colors draw my eyes all around the model. would be better off using a bone color/offwhite or any dark color scheme as a newer painter. will be easier/look better"
Warhammer,3d4sp5,eosgreen,2,Mon Jul 13 22:48:14 2015 UTC,"I started with a blue can from army painter, but I will be buying a white one before I move on, it was definitely much easier on the infantry...   Do you think I should abandon the crack idea and try shading the way up instead? Honestly I don't think id be very good at doing an effect like that..."
Warhammer,3d4sp5,eosgreen,0,Tue Jul 14 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"Before I give you advice I will preface it with my level so you hopefully take it more seriously (tons of people who frankly don't know what they are talking about give advice here) http://imgur.com/cW6kAQz,A15GwUk#0  2nd pic sucks but that blade is basically the level I'm at so heed my advice as I teach a lot of people locally.   new painter rules - stick to one solid color and one edge highlight for armor when you paint skin you will struggle so one skin color, one wash of brown, one drybrush of skin color again base coats take time to layer so I recommend a primer that is of the color (army painter makes a bunch so stick with them) Practice not overspraying on models you dont care about. Usually about a foot and a few inches away is good. Avoid very hot or cool temperatures 50:50 water to paint ratio or MORE water maybe 60:40. Thicker paints = more water use common sense. This is the most important skill. Learning to THIN YOUR PAINTS. never paint yellow, white blue/purple/red are the easiest colors to apply well and look nice by themselves   as for your eldar tank. I would do this....   spray it a color preferably not a white or whatever mix black + color or use a dark wash for the cracks clean the edges with the base color so no black is outside of the cracks paint the base plus a lighter color to the edges of all the cracks OR DON'T if you cant control the brush that well Now since the eldar use wraithbone (bone color etc) paint the bottom of the vehicle as such. Eldar armys are two colors usually. Helms and armor/robes. Green/white Yellow/Blue Brown/Black Red/Black   Personally I believe the red and black saim heim color scheme is easiest to paint for new players. Clean solid colors will always look better than trying fancy highlights you cannot do just yet"

Warhammer,3d01j4,Scorpion1122,14,Sun Jul 12 09:45:11 2015 UTC,"For a community that has been complaining that AoS is too similar to 40k in some aspects, there a certainly more parallels to be drawn with a rule-set that adds restrictions to shooting into combat, and Look Out, Sir! rolls of all things. They may have been in fantasy too, I don't know, but these house rules do lessen the gap between the two currents systems.  Let's have a proper look at some of it though:  BATTLE ROUNDS  RAW, this does nothing. The rules sheet does not refer to ""Initiative"" at all.  RAI, I can see how rolling for turns every round adds a random element that some may find unwanted, but I think it adds strategic depth.  COMMAND ABILITY  Fair enough.  PICKING TARGETS  Unnecessary. Missile attacks are already limited in that they can only be used in the owning player's turns. Look Out, Sir! is just an extra rule that add nothing competitive.   MAKING ATTACKS  This change automates a process that otherwise adds strategic depth. Also, requiring the unit to pile in, even when they are more than 3 1/2"" away, does nothing as you can only pile in 3"" and need to be within 1/2"" to be in combat.  CASTING SPELLS  More separation of missile and melee, followed by a much needed clarification on summoning.  The Armies Should be all-caps ;-P  RAW, you can't use actual AoS models (Stormcast or Goretide) as they don't have compendium PDFs AFAIK.  RAI, It might work? Needs extensive play-testing.  SCENARIOS  Good.  Disclaimer: This is just, like, my opinion, man"
Warhammer,3d01j4,jsheehan1996again,3,Sun Jul 12 10:45:34 2015 UTC,"A look out sir rule is really needed for this game (Yes Fantasy had a Look Out Sir rule). You can easily just decide when you want to kill a character if you have range units at all. Now the question is the complicated rule set that they put forward is what we needed i don't think so. It should just be If a hero is within 3"" of a unit they may make a look out sir roll for each wound inflicted on it before saves and on a 4+ a model from the unit takes the wound (with saves). That's just my opinion though."
Warhammer,3d01j4,random600,2,Sun Jul 12 12:58:28 2015 UTC,"In my AoS games, heroes have actually been more survivable than their Fantasy counterparts. The general nerf to shooting range combined with the fact that all heroes now have at least 5 wounds means that killing a hero before it's in your face is extremely difficult.  Also, there are numerous spells and abilities that heal wounds or boost saves. Taking a wizard or priest to help boost your hero basically guarantees that he will be extremely tough to kill."
Warhammer,3d01j4,ThePilot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this. I played with my Brets on the weekend against another Bret player. I lost my Lord to a lucky Trebuchet shot, but that was actually preferable, as it meant that he spent several turns hoping for several lucky rolls on my Lord, and leaving the better targets that would auto-hit and lose a lot to Battleshock (like my Men-at-arms who held his cavalry at bay for 4 turns) alone.  I have to agree with JSheehan up there for the other points too. the Battle Rounds were fantastic and had me making movement descisions based not only on this round, but the next. the Command Abilities were great, but not game-breaking.  I'll admit i stopped reading the OP after that >_>."
Warhammer,3d01j4,Veritor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:05:05 2015 UTC,"And you still need line of sight to shoot, so a hero that hides behind/within another unit or terrain isn't going to take a ton of shooting as is (assuming people are reasonable about line of sight and not saying they can see when it's only the weapon or 1/100th of the model. IMO, you should have to ""see"" at least half of the model, excluding equipment.). If a hero commits to combat, they can effectively be inside of a unit to minimize surface area so they don't take a whole lot of damage as is.  A more basic rule like -1 to hit when shooting at a ""small"" single model, or a model in/behind a unit that is less than twice it's height would be enough to stop heroes from dying too easily to shooting."

I didn't want to specifically name it in my main post because I didn't want the post to become another KoW > AoS post.  GW stopped making the game I liked to play, as a result, I've moved to another company that makes the game closest to it. It's still early days so I might like it more or I might like it less, but I've heard a lot of good things.  I didn't come to the Warhammer subreddit to type about KoW. I came to discuss with the community, as someone who will not be sticking with AoS, what it would take from GW to get me to give the game another try, and possibly stick with it.  I wasn't sure if there are rules against it, but I'm sure the mods and the community are starting to get annoyed with such posts."

Warhammer,3d0lj4,kde01,-1,Mon Jul 13 03:18:17 2015 UTC,"There won't be a second, more advanced rule set. There will be one rule set and it will be based off the one we have now. They'll flesh out the rules but they won't make it competitive.   The game doesn't need more rules to make it more tactical, IMO. How tactical it is depends on who is playing and how they're playing, not the rules."
Warhammer,3d0lj4,Involution88,3,Sun Jul 12 16:25:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It's similar to objectives.   Sure its possible to make the game BROADER and more COMPLICATED by adding explicit objectives. This leaves the game SHALLOW with an ILLUSION of strategic/tactical depth. It does very little to provide players with a deeper understanding of the game.  The ideal is to make the game NARROWER and LESS complicated while DEEPER. This makes the game more COMPLEX.  Examples:   Example of a complicated system. Hard to learn, easy to master. Objective marker 1(as defined on pg 99 of the rulebook) which is a barn (pg 43 of the town planning manual#510) is important to munchkin choices (as detailed on pg 294 of the relevant army book). It provides 1 VP as reward (as detailed on pg 583 of the rulebook). Dictated by the dice gods or scenario planners. Has no meaning or sense constructed by gameplay mechanics. Isn't an emergent gameplay element. All vocabulary to play the game is there, there are very few systemic properties. The game doesn't have much in the way ""syntax"" or ""construction"". Dawn of War 2 with bullshit points is an example. Try explain the basics of Dawn of War 2 in 3 words. Umm.. Ahhh.. Well...  Example of emergent gameplay. Easy to learn, hard to master. GO. Objectives and their value aren't determined by dice rolls. Objectives aren't explicitly identified. Objectives are created by the game state, their value can be altered by both players. Don't control the barn because you are told to. Control the barn because it does something. Something like protecting your flank, reducing enemy movement options, securing a corridor for your own troops to move, blocking line of sight etc. Good wargame systems almost always have kill them all as the only explicit goal with room for scenario specific objectives to be accommodated. New players (everybody's new at some point) almost always play a degenerate form of the game where things reduce to a scrum in the centre until they learn how things fit together and interact. Everything is a construction of some sort. Starcraft 2 or Dota is an example. Explain Starcraft 2's goal in 3 words: Kill them all. Dota's objective: Destroy their ancient. Simple. Clear. Easy to understand. Easy to work towards. Multiple paths towards the goal. Multiple sub goals."

Warhammer,3cynss,Diceslice,3,Sun Jul 12 07:56:06 2015 UTC,Did you use an airbrush or is it all brush painted? I really want to pick up a maggoth lord and a glottkin but I don' t own an airbrush and I'm wondering if it's possible to achieve smooth transitions without one. Great work either way  :D
Warhammer,3cynss,gravengames,3,Sun Jul 12 08:31:02 2015 UTC,"It was all hand painted.  The way I got the transitions is through using shades.  So for the arm I used for my base colors (top to bottom) liche purple (don't know what the modern name is) to screamer pink to pink horror.  From the green to the lich purple I used leviathan purple shade (not sure of current name)  from the liche to screamer I used Druchii Violet, and from the screamer to pink horror I used carroburg crimson.  At the very tip of the arm I used some reikland fleshade (pink horror is REALLY pink) and then added some blood for the blood god.  My advice for learning transitions to try and learn a what shades go best with what colors.  Also, on your base colors, instead of just painting a transition line between the two colors.....kinda stab with your brush that area or get a sponge and dab it with the color that is the lighter of the two.  This will help in the shading process by making the transition lines much less noticeable.  Hope this helps!"

Don't they already have powerfists? You could use that to get a stave in the units if psychic is giving you trouble in your meta. I'd probably drop the psycannon knight too. Maybe get a rifleman dread for a degree of antiair. Probably lower the ML too to free up some points. You have a ton of charge dice."

Warhammer,3d15i1,apalehorse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:38:44 2015 UTC,"Eldar are a hard counter to Greys. The teleporting flamers are a good idea. If this doesn't work out you could try interceptors against anything they don't have on a bike. Jump forward, flame them to soften and hurt morale, assault with one hammer and swords. Few units in an Eldar army can survive that and the cost isn't too high. Bikes are a pain to get into cc, keep in cc, and getting to them can stretch out your army too thin.  The only Necron units that should give you real trouble are wraiths and flyers and a command barge. You're pretty strong against the rest and Necron troops, vehicle assault sucks and they don't have psykers.  Let us know how it goes."

Warhammer,3d15i1,apalehorse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"There are three ways to treat warriors (1) ignore them (like you said, that's hard with low model count) (2) massacre them (assault is almost always the best way since shooting out a blob is cost ineffective, if you're worried about the overwatch try casting sanctuary or getting two units into assault range and hope that they waste the shots on the first assault group [either expendable or super resilient]) or (3) break them. Option 3 could work for you by forcing morale checks by psych and shooting. Those torrent flamers will be fun. GLHF."
Warhammer,3d15i1,Sunfeaster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:32:30 2015 UTC,Maybe get a rifleman dread for a degree of antiair.    Except a psyknight is way better anti-air with 6 S7 rending shots to the rifledreads 2 twinlinked S7 shots.

Warhammer,3cyf0m,Hosteen_Coyote,2,Sun Jul 12 06:53:59 2015 UTC,Neat! I've noticed the plethora of extra doodads that come with the AdMech kits look like they'd make nice conversions.

Warhammer,3cz7xp,mKevin64,2,Sun Jul 12 03:06:34 2015 UTC,"You need to cut costs in as many units as possible and get more firepower or more bodies on the table. Based on the number of bodies in units and the transports, it looks like you're going for resilience which is a legit strategy, but one that can be better developed.  No reason for meltabombs and a powerfist together on one model. Mutations, blight grenades and all other stuff like that has to go so you can get more bodies or fire power. The defiler, for example, is an already over priced model, so dropping the launcher (which you wouldn't be able to use if you fire the battle cannon) will net you points to invest elsewhere.  Who is the chaos lord with? He can't be in a rhino. Are you putting him with the cultists? If so, why tzeenech?"

Warhammer,3cwbyi,thegingerpants,7,Sat Jul 11 09:14:56 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, as a D&D player I like the look of the Stormcast Eternals to use as Warforged minis - something that is really difficult to find good models for. So I'm happy about that, at least.  Thematically I'm not a massive fan of ""Space Marines"" in fantasy, but I can't deny - the models are absolutely beautiful. For all their faults, GW are among the best miniature companies around for model quality.  As for the game itself.... I think without a way to balance it then it's a non-starter. There is no game in the world that doesn't have some kind of balancing rules. I know GW have taken a move towards the narrative, but that's still not a reason not to have balance. Wizards of the Coast wrote some simple free mass-combat rules for D&D (you know, the game that's actually supposed to be about narrative rather than balance), and you know what they include? A fucking basic guide for balancing the armies. They also include way better rules and mechanics for narrative aspects of a battle as well.  It's a shame, because I've always thought that what Warhammer needed was a ""lite"" and ""advanced"" ruleset to introduce a nice learning curve for new/casual players. I think what AoS does very well (if it had rules for balancing the armies) is offer a great Warhammer Lite ruleset, but I think removing the 8th edition rules was entirely unnecessary, and the lack of customization options backs a worrying trend for GW - for a model company that clearly cares more about their models than their game (fair enough, IMO), they are now actively discouraging creativity and modding with their rule-sets (not fair enough, IMO).  All in all, though... I think the new game, though a little simplistic for my tastes, is very accessible and has bags of potential. Going back to your original question about the models... what do I think? I think the models are so nice that I'd play the game if the ruleset was playable. But it's not currently, and no models can make up for that - I'm not an artist, I want to play games."
Warhammer,3cwbyi,bahamut19,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:28:42 2015 UTC,"the lack of customization options   I don't know about the updated rules for the old models, but the full box for the Stormcast Liberators has gone up on the GW site, along with their rules. They have four different basic weapon options, plus two choices for a 1-in-5 heavy weapon. That's more than a fair few 40k units, I know that much.  Of course, I may have entirely misinterpreted what you mean by ""options"". I also sympathise with your other gripes."
Warhammer,3cwbyi,jsheehan1996again,3,Sat Jul 11 10:50:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I wasn't that clear because I felt like I was already rambling and I wanted to be brief. Also I didn't want to be too negative - I think a version of Warhammer with accessible rules is 100% a good thing, and I don't want to discourage that, exactly.  Within the kits, cutomisation options are generally good. What I really mean can be summed up a bit by 40K and the removal of the looted wagons from the Ork codex, or the new Dark Eldar codex removing some weapon options from certain units. This wasn't done for balance, it was done because the models can't be bought as a single kit, but half the charm of modelling is kit bashing stuff together to get new, interesting builds.  I understand that the other side of the argument is that the hobby is already expensive enough without requiring kit bashing to build certain units, but I really enjoyed some of the flexibility found in older versions of the game, and it usually meant that experienced players never really ran out of things to do with their army.  It's a minor gripe to be honest - I actually think 40K is the best it's been in about a decade. AoS, however, is another thing entirely.  It just seems that GW can't decide whether it's a miniatures company, in which case kit bashing is only advantageous to them (they sell more kits for certain units), or a gaming company - where financial advantage (and therefore kit-bashing) may well need to be minimized, but the rules need to be at least a little bit balanced.   Right now with AoS we have unbalanced rules and very little about miniature building/painting as a hobby in general, so GW is not really offering much for either fanbase."
Warhammer,3cwbyi,bahamut19,2,Sat Jul 11 11:04:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly the best part about AoS is that it shows that GW want to move into the future. They want to make the rules and warscrolls living documents that they can change and update frequently. That, in my opinion, is a great step moving forward. No matter how the balancing issues are right now the point is in 3 months it could be totally different without them having to release books for the rules changes. If the do it right it will be a better way for them to come out with new rules and changes."
Warhammer,3cwbyi,noreservations81590,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, the main reason anything that doesn't have a model was cut from the rules is because a legal precedent was set that basically said GW can't sue companies that make models for rules they don't provide models for themselves. So instead of making the models, they cut the rules.  The update rules for fantasy may very well be a rushed crock of shite with joke rules out the wazoo, but - if you haven't already - go to your local GW (not a FGLS) and ask to play with their demo starter kit; I had great fun and the balance didn't seem too bad. It has been said that their idea of balancing is the missions: which in the starter kit have set unit lists, but not options. It definitely makes pick-up-and-play games basically useless though, a big part of the previous WFB community."
Warhammer,3cwbyi,jsheehan1996again,0,Sat Jul 11 11:35:53 2015 UTC,"I've only spoken to two people who have actually used the new rules (both advid and frequent gamers) and they've both said the new game is really really fun. It does feel like this is a game that would maybe have worked better along side traditional Warhammer. Just like as you said a ""lite"" and an ""advanced"" rule set.  I am very curious how army balancing will work, I have almost no idea how I'd do it with my friends other than by using previous edition as a base. They've made a massive move to a more casual warhammer but without a guide to balancing armies they only way to make 'fair' games is with experience with the troops, seems counter intuitive.   Still (as far as i know) everybody is going off the 4 page rules book on their site, we don't know whats in the actual rule book, there could be some more..."
Warhammer,3cwbyi,Theflyingpengy,5,Sat Jul 11 11:02:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, not a fan of the new models. They look a bit bulky with way to much happening on them. almost too much detail IMO. plus the banners are MASSIVE, just doesn't seem right to me. another thing, the wings on the flying models (noob here, remembering names is not my fortay) look fantastic but I'm not a fan of them being held up by the scrolls, I would personally forgo the scrolls to a clear flying stand.   in saying that, it is a personal opinion, I just haven't come to like the new models as yet.   otherwise, I have been a fan of a couple of the old warhammer models but was always a bit weary of getting into warhammer. with the new rules released I think I'll be getting a couple of dwarven gyrocopters to have friendly matches with, plus a lot of the old models look real centerpiece worthy that I may just paint for the fun of it."

Personally I love the lore of SA - though GW and FW literature always tries to talk about their stuff as dryly and grimdarkishly as possible, it felt like their entries in HH book 4 were as stoked as I was about an army of astronauts from Saturn fighting in 0G and no atmosphere on asteroids or the outsides of space stations, wielding Martian heat guns.

Warhammer,3cs4bf,Raurth,39,Fri Jul 10 09:25:44 2015 UTC,"I've been playing WHFB for about 17 years now with little pauses here and there, so I've seen my fair share of ""good"" and ""bad"" times but never in all these years I have felt so alienated like I do now. I lost all connection to the lore and proceedings of what I expect to be a tactical game.  All I can see and gather from your report (thanks for that, by the way) is some kind of ""play pretend"" but with miniatures instead of costumes. I hit 30 this year, I neither want to feel like ""bringing toys over to my friend's so our sleepover party is gonna be awesome!"", nor do I want to get drunk enough every single time to not cringe about the ""special rules"" that ask you to howl like a madman or what-not.  Sure, you can houserule to have such ""roleplay""-rules in effect all the time, but I wish this was where it stopped: You gotta houserule the ""points"", apparently the model's reaches, the summoning, and probably some other minor(?) stuff. If I wanted to make up my own game, I'd do so, but I rather expect the corp I paid thousands of bucks to to do that.  I (we) play the game for fun just like anybody else - but for me fun derives from having a fair match and pulling ahead due to being the better player on a given day. If I just wanted to fuck around, I'd rather just play a proper role-playing game like D&D, Call of Cthulhu or whatever than clashing my miniatures with those of my opponent while screaming ""For the Lady!"" to invoke a written rule. I've got half a dozen other miniature gaming systems sitting at home - next to the 5000+ ""points of Dark Elves or AelfsTM or whatchamacallits - and I'm asking myself, sad and mad at the same time, what the fuck do I do with them now, now that the most recent ruleset for them basically is ""Let's play Cowboys vs. Space Marines!""  Fuck.  But like I said, thanks for the insight, I've only recently looked into the upcoming disaster-in-the-making, I only wish it was something different to me. I've never thought I'd see the day, when 40k has the more complex rules of the two of them (after 2ed)..."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Daevar,6,Fri Jul 10 13:02:58 2015 UTC,This a thousand times. If I wanted to make my own game I'd just run a D&D campaign.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Faartz,9,Fri Jul 10 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"I stopped playing Fantasy for the same reason you feel like AoS is weird. I didn't want to go places with a thousand dollars spent on hundreds of little toy miniatures only to spend an hour setting everything up and discussing game terms followed by three hours of play. I gave up both Warhammer and 40k for that. No one wanted to play small battles of either of those. To make it worse, there were only a couple Fantasy players in my meta anyway - two young and annoying kids who just really fucking loved wizards. So I moved to Flames of War for a bit, which was much better at this. I dabbled in Warmahordes - a nice small sized game that went fairly quickly - because almost everyone over the age of 18 in my meta switched to Warmahordes. The player base was more mature, it was easier to play competitively, and the rules were objectively better and easier to understand so they all just wholesale moved over once it started blowing up a few years ago.  AoS is a quick, fun game. Yes, some things need to be better fleshed out and corrected but I highly doubt ANY system is fully fleshed out from it's very first iteration. It'll grow and evolve, things will be added as they need to be. I remain optimistic for it, personally."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,6,Fri Jul 10 15:01:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, I really want to stay optimistic as well. At first I was positively ecstatic about the intriduction of the concept of Warscrolls since they very much look like Malifaux' cards, which means they can really go nuts on the diversity of special rules, but speaking of Malifaux (as a skirmish system) - WHFB really was my chosen many-bodies-game. I can play Mx, Infinity, BFG or whatever if 10 to 20 minis is enough to fill my needs (and all those systems are better thought out rule-wise, too), but I want grand games from time to time with a solid framework of rules that goes beyond ""bring your stuff, roll some dice, watch what happens and laugh at it"".  As soon as any semblance of a balancing system gets introduced, I certainly will have another look, but omitting a point-system (or equivalent) just points me to the (lamentable) truth that GW is nothing more than a miniature seller, they don't even try to try anymore. How sad is that?"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Daevar,4,Fri Jul 10 15:57:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the points system. At first I was a bit turned off by it but, after thinking about it, figured the warscrolls could be balanced individually. Like limiting the amount you can take and forcing players to take more warscrolls if they want to up the amount (say - max unit of Chaos Warriors is 20 per warscroll, you need to take two for 30 warriors). I proposed this to my friend last night and he made a great point - the game really wasn't balanced even with points values. How many times had you played against a broken army in the past? Points don't guarantee balance, they just help give a small bit of balance. Doing away with the points system could actually be really smart IF the warscrolls are balanced against each other well.  Or maybe they just won't balanced the warscrolls against each other and expect players to discuss balance before the game. Who knows.  Your point about the 'many bodies game' is a good one. While I hated being forced to play 3,000 point games or larger (the two kids that actually played Fantasy in my area were only willing to play that size) when the mood struck me, and I had a good opponent, it was amazing. I can probably count the amount of amazing large-scale battles on one hand but I remember those more fondly than anything else.   GW's models are expensive, though, and building a 3k+ point army to enjoy your many-bodies game isn't cheap. You can probably do that same for $250 with Kings of War, even if their models are shit. If you need a many-bodies game that sounds like it may be better."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"Like I said: points or equivalents. Balanced warscrolls would be more than fine with me. Put a model count on the scrolls or whatever else is necessary. Limit the amount of same scrolls taken or whatever, really, I couldn't care less, I just don't want to do this all by myself, I want them - and I know how silly this sounds since GW playtesting has been notoriously bad - to at least try to balance the stuff they put out against something or somehow.  On the money-thingy: Yeah, it's great that ""we can now start playing with as little as 50 bucks put into it"" or whatever - but I'm hardly alone with having hundreds of tin and plastic minis sitting in a case or on a shelf at home, and like I said: I feel alienated, hardcore, by this. What about me? About the guy they already got his money's worth of? This is not how you do business, this is some scorched earth principle right here, they can be sure I won't put in any more money in Fantasy or 40k when I can't see them getting their Fantasy stuff together - who knows if 40k won't follow? With unbound armies there are already preeetty damn close to a line I don't want to see crossed - but at least you can easily say ""nope, no unbounds here"" and be done with it. I could ramble on for hours about this stuff - something you could do about Fantasy's rules as well, btw, or intricacies of unit choices/outfits/etc. This is gone. Completely. Slight side-effect..."

Just because I still have all the 4e books, doesn't mean I don't feel upset that they ended up not really releasing certain powersource class combinations.

Warhammer,3cs4bf,PirateRobotNinjaofDe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:19:16 2015 UTC,"I (we) play the game for fun just like anybody else - but for me fun derives from having a fair match and pulling ahead due to being the better player on a given day.   If you said this a couple of months ago, you would've been laughed out of the store. Nobody thought Warhammer 8th edition RAW was a viable, competitive game. Every tournament had its own rule set, from ETC to SweComp.  People with experience (the knowledge of which units were overcosted and underpriced) could easily build lists that gave them an advantage of the table. That's the opposite of being ""the better player on a given day"".  AoS has much less random chance and a lot more important choices throughout the game. 8th could be decided in one magic phase, purely based on rolls outside the power of either player. AoS has dice rolling, of course, but you can decide when you need to flee, which models to fight first with in combat, how to move in combat (combat movement didn't even exist in 8th besides reform), etc.  But, you're right that the copyright names are awful garbage."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Trikk,3,Fri Jul 10 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"8th RAW was fine as a tournament game, so long as you didn't play it 20-0 (which was itself a house rule). Playing Win-Loss-Draw, as per the BRB, made it a deep and compelling game about risk mitigation. Throwing in secondary and tertiary scenario objectives made it even better.  The comp packages were also tweaks on existing rules. Age of Sigmar requires essentially a ground-up creation of what the comp packs were trying to achieve...since there isn't ANYTHING AT ALL in the rules as far as balance is concerned. GW's latest attempts to create that are laughable, as are the attempts by fans to cobble something together with some kind of slapdash formula.  Why put all of that effort into essentially writing our own game, just to play a system that already invalidates our existing armies? Which is the real issue here..the legacy warscrolls ARE NOT MEANT to stand indefinitely. They will be replaced with new warscrolls for new armies, which GW has even said ""won't include the silly rules that everyone seems to hate."""
Warhammer,3cs4bf,PirateRobotNinjaofDe,4,Fri Jul 10 23:18:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't want to make WHFB 8ed sound like the golden grail of balance or anything. There sure were some justified and mostly agreed upon comps etc. But with those in mind or the simple rule ""Don't be an ass"", we failed to put completely lopsided battles on the table any time we played.  As for the RNG aspect: I haven't played AoS (yet?), so I really have no say in that, but it's always been the hallmark of a good general (or player of whatever game in general), so even with (what I consider as) trash rules like the demonic warp-thingy table in mind, if you play better, your odds and numbers will be better and with that your win tally - disregarding the amount of randomness in the game.  Anyway, I'm not here to rant for the sake of ranting or just to hate on anything new. I'm just bitter, that's all. I feel like exactky that kind of player GW more or less suddenly doesn't want to cater to anymore. Not that they have to, they got my dollars anyway, from an economic point of view it's perfectly understandable to target a group that complements your former audience, I just feel like the sucker left out."

With the models you own. No additional purchases necessary. If you think AoS is trash and not for you, there's no need to keep up with the Joneses.  I found more flaws with 8th than with the new thing, so I'm going in deep. If I never have to argue over front arcs or exact direction of a artillery die ever again, I'm happy. From my experience, games were often lopsided and conceded on turn 2 or 3 because people could predict with extreme accuracy who would win past that point.

Warhammer,3cs4bf,Daevar,4,Fri Jul 10 13:30:27 2015 UTC,Mantic started KoW years ago. Second Edition has been in the works for quite some time. The first edition was super streamlined and a much more concise version of typical rank and file fantasy battles.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Mirarii,15,Fri Jul 10 14:55:40 2015 UTC,Insightful! I've been hearing a lot of bad things but I'm still curious to see how it plays. Might actually dust off my Tomb Kings for this.  Hell they look better with dust! They're mummies after all
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Zombieburger,15,Fri Jul 10 11:56:03 2015 UTC,"Guy at store ""Oh wow! How did you get that cool dust effect?""  You ""ummm"""
Warhammer,3cs4bf,SlyfoxV,5,Fri Jul 10 15:07:18 2015 UTC,"Ha! I like that: ""The dust is part of the paint job... honest.""  Definitely give it a go. The game is not going to be for everyone. I mentioned that in the OP. But it IS fun, it has some redeeming features and shouldn't be written off."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,dooderthepooder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:24:49 2015 UTC,"The thing I'm seeing commonly missed by a majority of the community is that Games Workshop declared that they were eliminating the game and releasing an all new game. So the idea that WHFB players think that this game was going to be anything like the old game is a little silly. New game means a whole new game.   I for one have had a blast even playing by myself, the game is quick, fun and the tactics and strategies to utilize here have me analyzing my unit strategies, sizes and synergy more than ever.   I think that players should play both, pick your fav edition of WHFB (ala DnD players who live in 3.5) and play it, and on those nights of just drinking or hanging out with gaming buddies, bust out AoS for a quick fun skirmish or two. It's great."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,RoGueNL,13,Fri Jul 10 19:35:50 2015 UTC,"OP , thanks for sharing the story! I was just about to start out with Fantasy when I read that AoS was coming out. I waited for the ruleset , played some game and loved it. I never played the game , my friend hadn't played for 5 years and we were able to play within a couple of minutes  The line of "" On the other hand, it is a fun, simple ruleset, that people can come into with an exceedingly low barrier to entry, and play with beautiful toys, on amazing boards, and create their own stories and tales over games"" hit the nail on the head!"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:47:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I figured I'd do a write up as it's been a while since I did any for gaming, and I was surprised at how playable the game was."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Grunherz,2,Fri Jul 10 13:08:06 2015 UTC,"It's definitely good to see a writeup here. Most of the people hating on AoS haven't even played the game. They're throwing their toys out of the pram after skimming the rules and reading some angry posts online. I've spoken to a few of them on here and asked them to at least try it first, and they absolutely refused. How can you condemn it from 5 minutes reading the rules?"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,-4,Fri Jul 10 14:50:09 2015 UTC,Because sometimes you don't need to taste the turd before you know it's shit. If you have certain expectations in a game then it is very easy to determine if they will be met especially if the ruleset is only a few pages long.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,noreservations81590,4,Fri Jul 10 19:14:17 2015 UTC,"That may be the case for some, but many are in here claiming there are no tactics and the game can never be balanced (and is there for broken). What they haven't done is actually tried to play and use tactics or talk to their opponent and balance their army.   Those are two of the biggest concerns with the game and they're easily dismissed with a little bit of effort on the player's part.  I assume almost everyone in here bitching about how bad AoS is has a Fantasy army. If that's the case then they should be able to play a quick game. Grab a few units and play with a friend. If the person isn't in the mindset that 'this game is shit and I'm going to prove it' then I'm sure they'll have fun.  Whether the game is fun enough for a person is on them. Whether it's the style of game for someone it's also on them. Personal preference reigns supreme here, and AoS isn't going to be everyone's personal preference. But just because you don't like something doesn't make it shit."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Taear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:43:22 2015 UTC,AoS isn't going to be everyone's personal preference   Very true. Thats the reason they ended fantasy because it was hardly anyones preference. The game was dying fast and there was nothing they could do to save it.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"There are TONS of battle reports that all say the same thing, that it doesn't work and isn't good. Go on youtube, you'll find them."

Warhammer,3cs4bf,khaxal,55,Sun Jul 12 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"You do realise that you had to house rule measuring and your friend restrained himself from using his model as intended for you to have a fun game, right?   So essentially what you are saying is that the system doesn't work unless you ignore the parts that you feel don't work. Which means it isn't very good.  WHF needed to combine, eliminate and streamline rules. Not this unrecognizable mess.  Also, ffs, there have always been things like HE archers keeping at bay a bunch of Khorne chosen. And the option of just throwing models on the table until it felt balanced was there as well.  Lastly, one element to be mourned is the loss of the roleplaying elements. A skeleton, sorry, a deathrattler, will hit wih the same ease an elf swordmaster and a Bretonnian peasant. And all three of them will hit each other at the same time. Plus, I haven't seen any options for any unit. Which is the difference between ""your dudes"" and generic army no. 85."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,khaxal,23,Fri Jul 10 11:57:17 2015 UTC,"Hey man! I get that you're a bit salty, I really do, and while people are downvoting you for disagreeing, I won't (I've moved you back to +1 at least!). I'd hope it's more to do with your tone that what you've said. And yes, I do realise... seeing as I was the one playing the game! Funny that ;)  I specifically called out that I would feel pretty pissed if I was a stalwart WHFB player.  Every ruleset has things that are a little wacky or don't work very well. Warmachine's command rules are awful (the way they handle Fear and unit coherency - complete nightmare). But that doesn't stop you having fun, which is sort of the point of these games.  Yes, if GW wanted to release WHF 9th, they needed to streamline and tighten the ruleset. They've repeatedly demonstrated that they're incapable of doing this though, and continue to play to their strengths, which are stunning models and lots of dice rolling.   Lots of units have options, they're mostly confined to Heros, so your High Elf Prince can bring a Starblade or a Lance, whichever you like. Small amounts of customisation are available.  The differences between ""my dudes"" and generic army no.85 lie in the paint job, the choice of units, and how I use them. Same way the differences between Cygnar List 1 and 2 do in Warmachine.  I get that you're pretty miffed, but give it a go first, you might be surprised (as I was!)"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,crusoe,9,Fri Jul 10 12:19:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the upvote.  I did give it a try, and felt much less compelling than WHF. Units using missile weapons in combat, shooting at other units than the one they were in combat with (with no penalties whatsoever), the rather stupid sudden death rules, the horrific melee in which it all degenerated...  I am mostly a LotR/Mordheim/Regiments of Renown/Kill Team/HoR player, so not really a WHF hardcore, but all the elements that made me appreciate it as a strategic AND roleplaying game are gone.  The choice of units and the way you use them are the bare minimum for a wargame, so not really much praise to be given there. And as for the equipment on heroes, it doesn't mean much if there isn't some kind of restriction, ie. you aren't losing any troops to have a tooled up general. And no magic items...  Back in the day they managed to improve the ruleset, from herohammer to 6th there were many improvements.  I'm happy for you but I'm not seeing myself playing this in the future."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Trikk,7,Fri Jul 10 12:39:20 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, the game isn't perfect, or even nearly perfect. I'd say it was solid. I gave it a 3-3.5/5 based off my initial play.   Lots of stuff is missing, it'll be interesting to see where they go from here for sure. I think a lot of people need to appreciate that GW had to do something with WHFB - it was barely selling and had a hellacious barrier to entry that actively dissuaded people from getting into the game."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,khaxal,5,Fri Jul 10 13:07:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone disagrees with the fact that WHF was too costly to get into and its rules often burdensome.   The problem is how they decided to address this issue: instead of going back to the time when a 20 man regiment was a fucking rock and 1500 was the average points game, rebooting it all."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Trikk,3,Fri Jul 10 13:17:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely, they went pretty balls deep on the reboot. Was it required to go so heavy into rebooting the game? Time will tell! They definitely had to do something I don't think that's arguable.   I think they may have gone too far to one side, but we'll see what future releases are like."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:29:11 2015 UTC,Most rank and file combat degenerates into horrible melee once the units meet.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,AwareTheLegend,7,Mon Jul 13 02:12:24 2015 UTC,"You never played 8th with house rules and always optimally, right? Full cheese, never try to fix anything because the game was perfect out the box? Please.  The game is MUCH more geared toward roleplaying and fluff now. That's the one thing every hater so far has agreed on. It's made for casual, fluffy games and doesn't have a lot going for it in the competitive department."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,khaxal,3,Fri Jul 10 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"How is it much more geared for fluffiness and roleplaying? You always had the chance to ignore the points, or creating unbalanced scenarios. And in any of the previous editions you had more customization options, magic items altered greatly the role of a unit/hero."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Trikk,0,Fri Jul 10 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"You have just as many customization options now, in fact more. You are no longer restricted to any composition rules or point limits. That's conducive to roleplaying, as any experienced GM will tell you. Games like D&D, where everything can be optimized, inhibit roleplaying more.  The rules are also much more realistic, as units are no longer blocked by a single boulder on the battlefield or a lone eagle landing in front of a 50 man strong unit. It looks more realistic when the battlefield has chaotic melees going on everywhere.  Fluff is of course stronger when it's released from point restraints or forced choices."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,khaxal,5,Fri Jul 10 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"I'm with you buddy. I felt the old system was rigid, both in army composition and in playstyle. This is much more fluid. Whether that's better or not lies in the personal opinion of each player."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Trikk,2,Fri Jul 10 14:47:01 2015 UTC,I hate redirectors so much. Them being gone is so great.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,khaxal,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:36 2015 UTC,"You are not restricted because there is no rule about it. Which you have always been able to do by ignoring army composition rules. They aren't giving you new choices, they are just removing old ones (to play using a balancing system).  And I think we can all agree that redirectors could have been fixed without remaking the whole game."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,PirateRobotNinjaofDe,2,Fri Jul 10 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"We have to judge systems by their rules. If you pick and choose rules, then you can only play with a subsection of the player base that also does that to the same rules. Everyone who seriously cared about balancing disregarded the official points system to some degree, either adding another points system on top of it or simply restricting what you could pick.  If you don't believe me, go looking at tournament rules. Go read old army list forums. Find old threads for the release of every army book and see what 90% of the discussions are about. It's all: what's broken? How can I get an advantage against my opponent while making my army list? People even bought miniatures based on their performance on the table rather than what they thought looked cool and fit the lore of the rest of their units or army."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Trikk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"I know that there has always been a degree of house ruling in regards to all things warhammer, however, I think it is quite a stretch to compare it to Age of Sigmar where you have to ignore rules of some models altogether.  And back to the topic of fluffiness, how is it fluffy that now if you bring a goblin horde, against a bunch of chaos units, the chaos units will get sudden death even though they are likely a match or even superior to those goblins?  It's not that there are small things to house rule, it's that whole parts of AoS are retarded. Take that example, or the fact that you can fire missile weapons in combat, and from a combat to another combat, and without penalties whatsoever. And move, shoot, charge and melee in the same turn without penalties, so units with missile weapons effectively get to attack twice. And you can shoot through whatever terrain as if it was open ground.  It's a mess."

The legacy rules had ""epic meme"" special rules because GW thinks that's the humor of the typical WD-reading Warhammer player. Releases in the actual AoS line are not planned to have them.   And back to the topic of fluffiness, how is it fluffy that now if you bring a goblin horde, against a bunch of chaos units, the chaos units will get sudden death even though they are likely a match or even superior to those goblins?   It's pretty fluffy that a smaller chaos force will be able to deal a single devastating blow to a goblin horde and instantly scatter them, in my book. I don't know how that's going against the lore of Warhammer, to be honest.   It's not that there are small things to house rule, it's that whole parts of AoS are retarded. Take that example, or the fact that you can fire missile weapons in combat, and from a combat to another combat, and without penalties whatsoever.   That's only the general shooting rules. Read the warscrolls of the unit you are using to see if your unit actually can do that. Did you watch Lord of the Rings and scream ""bullshit!"" in every scene featuring Legolas or Kate from Lost?   And move, shoot, charge and melee in the same turn without penalties, so units with missile weapons effectively get to attack twice. And you can shoot through whatever terrain as if it was open ground.   You mean like the vikings did for hundreds of years? Mongolians? Romans? Chuck a spear, dive into the fray. I'm not sure why you object to TLoS."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Trikk,2,Fri Jul 10 23:20:11 2015 UTC,"-You are missing my point. The rules that OP's friend ignored weren't the silly ones, but the serious ones.  -A horde dealing a devastating blow is all and well but if both armies are evenly matched I fail to see why should the chaos army have an advantage over the goblins.  -If the rules don't forbid it, it is allowed. This is not just Warhammer but how the real world works most of the time. It's as simple as that, and I have yet to see a missile weapon that is barred from shooting in combat, and in combat to another combat.  And by the way, Legolas was supposed to be one of the finest and quickest warriors of a race of fine and quick warriors. Had Gimli done that everyone would have called foul.  -You really are stretching things here. You are talking about throwing spears, throwing axes, shortbows and the like. Which have absolutely nothing to do with crossbows, longbows and arquebuses. These take time. Lots of it.  And you still haven't addressed the fact that troops with projectile weapons attack in two phases of the game instead of just one.  But yeah, the new ruleset is tighter and fluffier than ever."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,PirateRobotNinjaofDe,2,Fri Jul 10 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"Out-of-the-box, full cheese, no houserules, against competitive players doing exactly the same. And it was fucking awesome. I've also played all sorts of comp packs in every flavour and variety, which are fun in a different way.  Difference is that WHFB 8th worked out of the box. Age of Sigmar doesn't. It's half a rules set, that can't support anything but extremely casual play between familiar opponents. It needs extensive houseruling to be even halfway workable, and even then why pick this game over a dozen other fantasy skirmish games - which Age of Sigmar clearly rips rules from, but with worse execution."

Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,3,Fri Jul 10 23:20:41 2015 UTC,"I watched a dozen or so over the weekend, and have watched several battle reports. There's nothing there. The rules are a poor amalgamation of 40K and Warmachine rules, without the depth or complexity of either. There are a dozen other skirmish games that are better executed. And that's not even to lament the removal of all those elements of complexity that made WHFB what it was: character creation, facings, unit formations, etc.  It's the complete lack of any pretense of game balance that really kills this for me, though. There isn't even a framework for setting up casual pickup games, let alone competitive games. It's a complete mess, and for them to suggest that this is a full replacement for WHFB is quite frankly laughable."

The guys from the Chumphammer podcast are in my club. They got a review copy last thursday in the mail, fortuitously right before our last tournament. It was set up all weekend for anyone to play.  Consensus among everyone who tried it is that the models are gorgeous (look WAY better in person), and the game is pretty fun...as a boxed set. If this was the new Dreadfleet then awesome.

I'd say if you want a balanced and deeply strategic game, you're buying from the wrong company.  As someone who hasn't played Fantasy since the models were lead (I have a dragon that weighs about 40 tonnes), I enjoyed my foray into AoS."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,noreservations81590,9,Fri Jul 10 13:11:12 2015 UTC,"It is impressive that GW managed to create a game called Warhammer that almost exclusively appeals solely to people who have not played Warhammer recently.  Not sure it that was their intent or not, but it is certainly a thing."

GW has NEVER come out with a game that was balanced. Even 40k, its flagship game is hilariously unbalanced if no agreement is struck between players. Its always been like that and GW are just embracing that. At least they are going the living document route with the rules so the can update quickly and frequently when they need to."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,3,Sat Jul 11 16:18:21 2015 UTC,"Which is the difference between ""your dudes"" and generic army no. 85.   That will lie in the abilities section. I was trying to figure this out for a few comparisons a bit ago. Looking at bretonnian archers, they seemed insanely powerful thanks to arrowstorm and all the synergy in the army.   One of their rules is they cannot fire while an enemy is within 3"", while many other ranged model can still fire in the shooting phase. I don't know the exacts on even close to half the units in the game, but the abilities section of the warscroll is generally the meat of the unit."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,mugginns,2,Fri Jul 10 13:38:44 2015 UTC,"You make a good comparison between archers from different teams, but I believe /u/khaxal was talking about units within the same team.

Which you can do in Age of sigmar, they are just free, so there is no downside. Many infantry can still customize the weapon they take. This seems like a pointless discussion."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Zel1988,3,Sat Jul 11 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"Im still very undecided on AoS. I have played Fantasy for about 3 years and have had a blast while doing it. However, i do acknowledge that it needed a change (streamlining etc).   My main problems with Age of Sigmar so far are that there are no point values, which annoys me for obvious reasons, and that it more often than not it devolves into a slugfest in the middle of the board which is won by whoever gets priority on the second turn.   I understand that there is strategy involved and i understand alot of it. However it feels too much like a cobbled together game which wont really hold my interest for longer than a month. Whereas Fantasy had kept me with it, on a game every 1 or 2 weeks, for a number of Years."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Zel1988,3,Fri Jul 10 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"The lack of points values is a pretty big issue, one would hope that it is a temporary thing while they phase out the old collections.  My solution, were I making the game, would be to ensure that the set Battlescrolls (the theme list type things) from the AoS starter box onwards were balanced against each other in such a way that you can say: ""We're having a 2 Scroll tournament"" and it be fair enough."

I think this is the best way to do it, too, and I hope that's how it ends up. Balancing troop scrolls against each other, if only a bit, then that would go a long way towards 'balance.' For example - say one warscroll of Skaven clanrats is 10-50 rats. If you want to take 60, then you need a second warscroll. A unit of knights is 5-15 - if you want 20, you need to take two warscrolls. That should help about people bringing 200 Chaos Warriors in a 3 warscroll game, though that does sound pretty cool."

He made a very good point - it's not like games were balanced with points values, either! There were always players who took advantage of loopholes or built ultra-competitive lists that weren't any fun for someone on the receiving end. Having a points system isn't any guarantee of balance at all.  Talking to your opponent and discussing each other's army is the best way to go, IMO. It seems I'm blessed with a great meta with great people as many people in this sub seem to be convinced none of their opponents would ever be willing to do this. I don't know, I'd say give it a try and see what happens. All the rules are available to all of us so you should have an idea how powerful each of your opponent's units are and if it's balanced.    and that it more often than not it devolves into a slugfest in the middle of the board which is won by whoever gets priority on the second turn.    If it's played this way that's unfortunate. It doesn't have to be a slugfest in the middle. There's so much space on each side to use. Fast units like Ellyrian Reavers or Dark Riders can do a lot of damage by range but you wouldn't march them into the center for a scrum. Run circles around your opponent and whittle him down. If you're playing with a unit that gets a charge bonus you can repeatedly disengage and charge again until the opposing unit is dead. You can force units to charge what's closest to them.   I've only played one game but I've watched several. Most of the guys playing have at least a small Fantasy background, some years back, but have played Warmahordes for a while. I think that may help them catch on to the AoS tactics better than traditional Fantasy players who expect to use LoS, pivots, and locking people in combat with large, cheap units."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,shauni55,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"((talk to your opponent beforehand and balance your lists))   I also have a group of people who in general are very good at balancing lists for a fun game. However I believe that they should still have done something to attempt to balance it. Even if they had of introduced some kind of tier system where for example plague bearers (which are very powerful in AoS) would be in some kind of 2nd tier so they are equivalent to say Saurus temple guard. Whereas Skeletons could be said to be the equivalent of goblins with both being in tier 1. Idk, not a good system but they could have tried something.   ((Run circles around your opponent and whittle him down))   That's part of the problem as far as i see it. If say a person is fighting ogres (movement 6) and is trying to hit them with skeleton horse archers (range 18). The ogre player can with 2 turns in a row, kill my horse archers with nothing I could do about it.They will only require a six to charge even if they don't run. Im not saying that you cannot fight tactically or that these units are useless, but the way the game works makes it an investment that could be better made with units that will fight the mainstay of the enemy army and this annoys me.  Edit. I apologize for not quoting correctly i couldn't figure out how to do it"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Mirarii,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:21:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. What if both players are brand new and not good at balancing lists? It's a goofy game played with serious, expensive models. If you're looking for a goofy, silly time without having to deal with balancing and whatnot, why not play Cards Against Humanity or Charades or Catchphrase? Those games are funnier and cost $10 and you're done. They're targeting a casual boardgame audience with a game that has expensive units. I understand that you don't need a ton of models to play AoS, but it still doesn't change the fact that a guy who wants to use Nagash in AoS will still have to buy a $100 model."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Kaiic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:58:57 2015 UTC,"I understand there are ways to make it work, but how do you make 2 balanced armies if both players are new  and know nothing about the other? It just seems like a lot of work, having to go through each unit's stats and their rules, compare them to all these other units. ""Well these guys sort of equal out to 7 of these guys, so I'll do 10 of them,"" etc. It just sounds like tons of work just to get the board set up. If people want to balance the game, I think they should just make their own set of rules from scratch, there's really no point in using GW's. A guy talking to his models or holding up his glass and saying ""For my lady"" won't still be funny 2 years into playing anyway."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Mirarii,9,Sat Jul 11 07:53:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not a WHFB player.  I primarily play 40K. I play casually, and am not hardcore in any sense of the term.  My FLGS hosted 3 days of Age of Sigmar playing after the rules dropped on the fourth.  We played it extensively.  75% of the people I game with who had preordered Age of Sigmar canceled that pre-order after our playtesting.  It's an awful, awful game.  The best I can say is that it plays fast.  However, without a LOT of understanding between the players, it's a shitfest of epic proportions.  It's also tactically dull...I'd almost say empty.  The dice decide your fate more than anything you can do on the table.  So far how willing you are to embarrass yourself in public has been the main decider of victory.  The main tactic ends up being ""push everything to the middle of the table, roll 3+, roll 4+, repeat"".  Balancing by wounds is a bad joke.    All in all, I played or watched upwards of 50 games over three days, and my takeaway was very different from yours.  I'm not hardcore...but I do ask for a bit more from my games than this one gives.  Space Marines in Fantasy are also a stupid idea.  All that said, Kings of War and Warmahordes sales are now through the roof at my store."

Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,3,Fri Jul 10 14:45:34 2015 UTC,Those are probably the scenarios in the main book to get you started. A lot of starter sets come with these. I assume GW will be making proper campaign books soon enough.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,ChicagoCowboy,0,Fri Jul 10 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"Notice that they're all defined by specific model constraints? How much do you wanna bet that those are going to require us buying the ""new shiny"" every 6 months to get new scenarios.  Yeah...fuck this game.

Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,5,Fri Jul 10 14:30:03 2015 UTC,I'm the kind of person who gets bored in games of 40k just because of all the nuanced rules and long drawn out phases. A buddy and I tried a tiered activation mechanic that involved drawing tokens out of a bag for who activated a unit and went through all it's phases next. It made the game much more dynamic and reactive and eliminated the horrible wait between turns. This is part of the reason I like Warmachine and Malifaux over 40k. Plus shorter turns. I'm really hoping to get into AoS. Thanks for the writeup.
Warhammer,3cs4bf,LiquidAether,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"based upon your reply, I think you'll love AoS.  The combat phase feels extremely dynamic since you can pick any of your units to attack."

We haven't been able to play any 40k or anything in a few months because of the time investment so a nice quick and easy game would be preferable. Plus spending half the time buried in a rulebook sucks.

I was like taking me back to when I first played Warhammer all those years ago, but i UNDERSTOOD what was going on. I wasn't rolling countless dice over and over and going through the motions."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Kaiic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:47:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This is exactly how it went for me. I walked away from GW several years ago for many reasons, one of them being that there were no fantasy players in my meta, but AoS has brought me back.   AoS seems to appeal to the general market much more than Fantasy did. Fantasy sales were in the toilet, so they needed to do something. This might just be it. You can't support a system when no one is buying models and if this gets popular we'll quite probably see the rules evolve quickly.  People complaining about competitive gaming should have already moved on to other systems, IMO. GW has never really made a competitive product - and I say this as someone who would compete years in Gamesday tournaments back when that was a thing."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,TheBadNamesWereTaken,5,Fri Jul 10 15:54:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! As a long time Fantasy player, I more or less agree with this assessment. My buddy and I (also a long time fantasy player) tried AoS out Wednesday night, and had a blast.   Its definitely not the warhammer fantasy that I know and love, and in fact crave, but it is what it is - a fast, simple game using some of the best minis GW has ever produced.   We did decide to make some changes to the ruleset as well after seeing so many battle reports online showcasing the massive balance issues:   used MWG Steve's points systems to balance the armies measured from bases since they have them and its easier, and disallows cheap ""well his sword is pointing forward so he's within 3"" to strike"" chilled the summoning aspect, still used it but just agreed not to be dicks about it - in the future, we'll likely use the Warseer rules that replace summoning with a healing feature instead, with different casting values depending on the unit targeted counted models as being ""in range"" of their own effects - ie, my BSB got to use the boost from his banner once he planted it   Will be playing more this weekend, so far I'm enjoying it - if for no other reason than it gets my WoC and Lizardmen out of the closet, and lets me use models that I would have never used in WHFB (dragon ogre shaggoth! Carnasaurs!!)"

Warhammer,3cs4bf,TheBadNamesWereTaken,2,Fri Jul 10 12:30:44 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that fun is not enough.  Lots of games are fun.  I could play Yahtzee all day and have fun.  But people played Warhammer because they wanted more.  Building an army, figuring out how to cover different strengths and weaknessed, do I go for lots of cheap guys or a few expensive ones?  Then playing in a game where facing matters, and maneuvering is the heart of the game.  I lot of new people getting into the game see it as ""It's a fun game, isn't that enough? Go play something else.""  Normally this would be try, like if we were talking about Warhammer vs Warmahordes.  But GW has decided to make this a zero sum game.  If you don't like AoS, you have no alternative to play unless you want to just play an unsupported game as models slowly vanish off the shelves forever.  That's why people are salty, or at least why I am, because they killed Warhammer and replaced it with something entirely different.  Of course, none of that changes the fact that burning your collection is ridiculously stupid.  Sorry for the rant, but the answer to ""But the game is fun, isn't that the point?"" is no."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,ChicagoCowboy,5,Fri Jul 10 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get it! I said that if I were a WHFB player I'd be pretty pissed, and justifiably so. It is a major change.  I treat it like I treat having different boardgames at home. One of the comparisons I've made is that playing AoS is like playing those 4th edition boxed DnD games. You turn up, you take some things out of a box, the rules are simple (just do what it says on the card) and you have a bit of fun.  I appreciate that's not going to be enough for hardcore WHFB players. I think they are a demographic that GW have realised that they are never going to be able to appease because it's just not what they do best, or even well.   So what can they do to try and salvage some sales? Bear in mind, they're under huge amounts of pressure from competitors and realistically it's the first time they've had big competition as PP have been going from strength to strength since MK2.  Either they try to release a balanced, competitive tactical game like WM/H but suffer from the same huge barrier to entry they've had before, or they create an easier to get into, entry level, board-game style miniatures game that they can use to push people onto their other product: 40k.  Interesting decisions for sure."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,2,Fri Jul 10 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the downvotes - it seems anyone who praises AoS in here nowadays draws ire.   Anyway, I think the game can be more. We're in the very, very first part of the opening act for the new game. AoS is days old and people are already declaring the doom of GW's Fantasy side of things when I think it is more of a reboot. It'll take some time to get the rules fleshed out but I'm sure that will be the priority for them after they release the four orders with associated models."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,Kaiic,3,Fri Jul 10 15:47:29 2015 UTC,"Ah no worries, it's expected :)  I'd agree, if I were GW right now I'd be working very sodding hard to start releasing stuff."

GW has the chance to make this game great here, I hope they don't fuck it up. They've got a clean slate, they've got the interest of a lot of non-GW fans, and they've got fantastic models that will sell regardless. If they can summon some success the next 6 months they'll be in a great spot with this game."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,FrigginPandas,2,Fri Jul 10 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"I choose not to give them time to figure it out because this is a company who has spent 30 years making games.  After 30 years, they ought to be able to release a game that isn't broken on day 1.  They may improve things eventually, but I'm judging them on what they've given us now, especially since they refuse to tell us any future plans.  I am, of course, very frustrated with what happened to WFB and disappointed in how GW chose to deploy AoS."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,PedroHeadShotz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:49:52 2015 UTC,"The lack of communications sucks, I'll definitely give you that. I wish there was a roadmap of the next three months at least. Perhaps a quarterly roadmap for AoS so we know the releases and the rules updates before they come. At least make an effort to communicate out that improvements are coming.   But GW is kind of in uncharted territory here. Change is hard, for any company. They've just take their second biggest game out of existence and replaced it with a new game. Ask anyone who works in a corporation. Change is incremental and a long process. They've not just created a new game but they've created it out of the ashes of a beloved fantasy universe that has many fans. Maybe it's just me remaining optimistic and forgiving (since part of my job revolves around the constant change in my corporation) but I do know just because you've done something before doesn't mean you can go ahead and replicate it with full success.  This isn't Warhammer Fantasy V2, after all. It's something totally different from what GW has tried before."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,makeskidskill,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"But see, I still introduce the game too friends who don't play mini games and the same problems are there.     They have to buy models that when compared to other products (not just models) come out short.  They still have to get them ready before the game even sets up.  And the rules are simplified but still cause people who don't play these types of games to sit back and go... ok so how long for me to know whats going on.  Part of problem with AoS discussion here is that most are already into GW games and so understand the basic outline of TT gaming.  My friends who look at 40k as to complicated, still look at AoS and go... ""look at the block of words for rules... and there are still the armies I have to learn.... no thanks""    As much as it has changed from WH:FB it hasn't actually removed barriers, unless you already were primed to play anyway."

I just see from this, is just the GW norm.  New rules to add some intrigue, new models, old players leaving and new players coming on, old models phased out.  Now if GW had just worked on making the old rules viable, like giving out for free, all the old rules electronically and update them to the times, that would have been a different GW."

In just a single week I've introduced Age of Sigmar to two players who wouldn't even touch miniatures games, because they felt they were too rules heavy.  They weren't even going to try Age of Sigmar until I showed them it was a 4 page rulebook.  After playing a few games (pulled out my Ork and Dark Elf armies) they loved it and preordered the starter box.  It's entirely possible that my experience is the exception, but from my view AoS has definitely broken down some barriers.

Some people don't like the lack of points because they don't see how it's possible to balance without them, but were armies always balanced WITH points? No, they weren't.   Different metas, different rules. It would be nice to have more than 4 pages of rules but we don't need anther 200 pages of rules.

Warhammer,3cs4bf,gwarsh41,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"I played my first AoS game yesterday and I had a blast. Showed up to my GW and me and another guy there just pulled out everything we had in our bags to play. I ended up with: Shaggoth, 3 Dragon Ogres, Bray-Shaman, Ogre Tyrant, 2 Butchers, one squad of 6 Ironguts, two squads of 8 Bulls, two squads of 8 Leadbelchers, an a squad of 2 Maneaters.  My opponent brought a Ghorgon, a unit of 6 Minotaurs, Malagor, a Bray-Shaman, a Chaos Wizard, a Wargor Standard Bearer, and a huge blob of 70 Gors, and a squad of 12 Fleshounds.  I both won by eventually wiping him out and technically won by Sudden DEath since I picked the Endure objective and we went to 11 or 12 turns.  The Shaggoth and Dragon Ogres happened to be deployed near the flesh-hounds and wiped them out in a turn of combat (+ Battleshock), the Ironguts faced off against the Minotaurs who wiped out all but the sergeant before they killed the minotaurs off with the help of the Maneaters. Over the course of the battle I ended up piling 7 units into the Gors. He kept his General near to the unit and just pumped them up with Inspiring Presense. I was not smart enough to go after him until near the end of the game, though. Once I managed to kill his general and the Gors started taking Battleshock tests the Gors went from ~35 remaining models to dead in 2 or 3 turns. My Shaggoth did slaughter his Ghorgon twice (stupid Bray-Shaman re-summoning him).  It seemed like a pretty balanced game overall, when I finally finished him off I had a Shaggoth, a butcher, and my bray-shaman left.  My take away:  The stock rules seem best balanced for somewhat smaller games. It took us about 2.5 or 3 hours to play that game. We might have been able to bring it down to about 2 hours, but it was both our first game.  I ended up being largely immune to Battleshock. With 2 or 3 damage on most of my guys I was killing off 4 or 5 models on his side per combat. He might get 1 or 2 of mine. So he'd lose another 3 or 4 to the battleshock and I'd only lose more if I rolled really bad. When I did fail a battleshock it hurt like hell since my 4 wound Ogres (sorry, ""Orogs"") would just evaporate even if thy were otherwise unhurt."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,gwarsh41,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:50:28 2015 UTC,"I think many people in this sub do not understand the underlying problem of the AOS release and have a wrong perspective on the whole ordeal.  The problem with the AoS release from a WHFB players perspective is NOT how balanced or good AoS is. The problem is it is no WHFB game and it never will be, no amount of balance will change this. It is a totally new game. The fact that there is a new game is also NOT the problem, hey many would be glad to get a decent small/skirmish ruleset for their fantasy miniatures. (Mortheim my sweet prince).  The problem is that GW stops all support for WHFB and basically kills the game with the release of AoS. There won't be any new exciting rules, races, units. There won't be a possibility to still play your 8th Edition unless you already have your armies, because from what we saw in the rumors it sounds like the old miniatures will be faded out. The Fluff of the WHFB got already killed of. GW absolutely stopped WHFB and it will die and be unplayable in the forseeable future, because there won't be any fresh blood, fresh rules to keep it interesting, fresh miniatures etc.   The argument ""I just keep playing 8th"" is bollocks longterm."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,0,Sat Jul 11 14:20:32 2015 UTC,The point that fantasy players are missing is that there was no reason for GW to continue to support fantasy. They are a model company that wants to sell models and make money. The fantasy community has been dwindling for a while and they simply weren't making enough money off of it to continue. Nothing GW could have done would have gotten fantasy back to making the kind of money that GW wants.

And that is the kind of attitude that lead to them loosing money in the first place. They looked fine up to the 7th Edition which is considered the last good edition. They simply stopped supporting the game after loosing money on it with 8th Edition which already killed a majority of the community.  Fantasy was just fine pre 8th Edition and instead of thinking ""Wow maybe we made game that people don't like. Time to fix it, ask the community what they want and improve on the points the community is criticizing for the beginning of the time.""  No in their arrogance it was just ""People are dumb and not buying it, lets kill it and try something else and piss on the rest of our Fantasy community."

If you summok too many you can lose because of it even though you may have more models on the board. A subtle but balancing point.

Measuring from the model is probably one of the dumbest rules I've ever seen in wargaming. Also shooting into and out of combat. also summoning.

Warhammer,3cs4bf,TheBadNamesWereTaken,0,Sat Jul 11 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"it matters when you're not willing to stand your base on top of another model's base. that would mean 40mm based models would be out of standard 1"" melee from anything in base contact, since 1' wouldn't make it from their center to the center of any other base"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,mugginns,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:09:52 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I was just thinking for ranged attacks. Still, doesn't the standard ""Weapons and banners don't count as parts of the model"" rule apply? Where just the body counts?"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,mugginns,-1,Sat Jul 11 04:12:34 2015 UTC,"NOPE. closest part of the model measured to closest part of the enemy model as per rules. banners and tassles and and weapons all totally count. that rule is only in 40k. So I could model my high elf spearmen holding their spears straight forward and get an extra inch or 2 of melee range, OR if it's going to be an issue for me, just turn them backwards and take back that extra 2 inches"

Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,3,Fri Jul 10 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely say it works as a gateway drug too, opening the doors into other games. Whether GW realise that people will move from AoS onto other company's games is a different story."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,mugginns,4,Fri Jul 10 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"I could totally see that happening. I know a few other people who have zero interest in a scifi setting for 40k, but are interested in Age of sigmar. Most of them D&D fans, so if AoS isn't as involved as they would want, I could see a conversation of ""what happened to warhammer fantasy"" and eventually them trying kings of war.   Though, these are the same people who play pathfinder, D&D 3.5, 4th, 5th, and several board games. So I doubt they would have any problem with playing 2 war games.   Besides, by the time a player moves from AoS to warmachine, kings of war, or even maybe 40k. GW has got some cash in it's pocket, so it is a win in their mind. At this point, I am curious if the rumored new releases for AoS will be similar starter boxes with other factions, then the additional scenarios will be all the starter box armies (new AoS story armies) fighting each other. That would put it a step closer to board game territory.   The simplistic rules are refreshing, and I am salty from recent games of 40k at my LGS. AoS is a nice thing to have, I hope that it continues to be polished, and the ""hundreds of scenarios"" are not a let down."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,mugginns,3,Fri Jul 10 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"Of course, GW will be hoping that people will transist from AoS into 40k rather than competitor products. Time will tell if it works!"
Warhammer,3cs4bf,kde01,2,Fri Jul 10 14:15:54 2015 UTC,"The simplistic rules are refreshing, and I am salty from recent games of 40k at my LGS.   In those games of 40k were all the armies you played balanced against yours just because points were involved?   I'm asking because it seems like people in here think points are the only way to balance armies and without them we're all fucked.  I liked AoS, too. For many of the reasons you mentioned. Especially the simplistic rules. I figured out how to play the game after watching one game. It took me a bit longer with Malifaux and Warmahordes but MUCH longer with Fantasy and 40k because of the hundreds of pages of rules I was expected to learn.  In a way I'm happy they scrapped everything and started from scratch. The potential is huge. Let's see if GW can live up to the task."
Warhammer,3cs4bf,apalehorse,2,Fri Jul 10 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"You could argue that the games were not balanced thanks to the points. Half the people love saying things are under and over costed all the time.  Mostly it was because people at my LGS seem to be fitting into 2 categories. Play to Win/WAAC or say you like casual games, then complain about what your opponent brought.   There are a handful of awesome opponents, but just being in the same room with the dudes who are yelling about rules and dice rolls is stressful and not really that fun."

He even mentioned that when orruks finally comes out, they are gonna stop selling orcs and goblins.

Warhammer,3cowy2,CarolusX2,3,Thu Jul 9 17:39:34 2015 UTC,Chromed surfaces seem to be always the same: sky when the surface points upwards (towards the sky) and ground when it points downwards (towards the grouns). Light blue and desaturated brown are the most typocal sky/ground colors. Towards the horizon the contrast is bigger: the sky is lighter and the ground is darker.

Warhammer,3cowy2,Shalozar,3,Sun Jul 12 02:53:49 2015 UTC,My only regret is that I have but one upvote to give.
Warhammer,3cowy2,Daevohk,3,Thu Jul 9 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Some people asked for it,  so here is a full tutorial: I prime it black,  since there will be black outlines.  When I painted each part,  I thought about where the black lines would be,  specially whrn painting cloth.  Since there is a high contrast,  I start with relatively light colors,  and,  excluding spe ial cas3s, a few layers are wnough to get a perfectly shaded part.  With black lines,  the miniature starts looking really great with the first layer!  I usually loathe painting muscles,  they look messy.  But with that cartoony,  clean look, it looked so good with just a few strokes that I was incredibly motivated.   The downsides? You must be really,  really clean.  There can be no mistakes,  ABSOLUTELY no mistakes.  If there are,  then they must be corrected with black paint (dont worry too much,  only the first layer is hard to paint). Some parts are really hard to paint this way,  like the tails, or the feet.  Of course, unless the surface is really special,  say goodbye to wahes and drybrushing.   Now the NMM.  Very easy: intense gradients,  from a dark/medium color to almost white. Getting a smooth gradient that goes to ver dark to almost white can be very difficult,  though,  and the quick change might make layers very visible. If this is the case,  you can add paint between 2 layers to make the transition smoother.  A good way to make really smooth gradients on rather big surfaces is usibg reaaaally watery paint.  When ypu move the brush from point A to B,  more paint remains on B and less on A,  creating a smooth transition (still,  you will need several layers).   The OSL: the object projects light.  Remember that light doesnt go through surfaces.  Many people forget this when painting osl with an airbrush: they just spray everywhere around the light source and the result makes no sense.  The trick when painting osl is transparency.  There is a transition with transparent light.  There are two ways to do this.  Lets suppose it's purple light.  One: I vould paint layers mixing purple/white paint with paint that has the same color as thr background. Two: I can use only purple/white paint with enough paint to make it transparent.  That is,  glazing.  There is glazing medium that makes paint much more transparent,  but it also increases drying time a LOT,  so unless this changes with some product,  you can use just water.  But the brush must hold really little super watery,  quite transparent paint,  since otherwise it would flow everywhere.  The composition is also very important to add realism.  I thought about putting a small rock nrar the ball on the groundz stopping light and creating a line like zone of the ground that the light doesnt reach.  That would have looked great,  but it was so small in the end I didnt do it because it wpuld barely be seen.   Finally the chrome.  What matters is the direction of the normals,  and that's why the reflection isnt horizontal like the horizon.  When the surface points downward,  it reflects the ground.  When it points upward it reflects the sky.  If there is something near,  it would be reflected too (the clothes and the hands of the rat holding the cannon are reflected).  Y artificially painted some ground/sky that followed the shape of the cannon. By the way,  I painted the ground first,  from light to dark,  since the light  part was near the rat and were much more difficult to paint."

Warhammer,3cr9hx,noreservations81590,2,Fri Jul 10 12:29:42 2015 UTC,yeah I was really shocked when I heard about the switch. Kinda ruins the unique feel of units and unit formation that warhammer has vs. the looser shape of deployments of 40k.
Warhammer,3cr9hx,EthanF,2,Fri Jul 10 13:17:52 2015 UTC,Absolutely brilliant work.
Warhammer,3cshyp,The_Evil_Studmuffin,44,Fri Jul 10 12:26:25 2015 UTC,It's a video game most fantasy players have wanted for years.  It's great for the ip considering total war is such a giant ip in the strategy genre.
Warhammer,3cshyp,Pawsaldo,18,Fri Jul 10 12:35:38 2015 UTC,It's a shame that the time the PC game has come along coincides with GW reshaping the game to work and look totally different from what the game will represent.

Warhammer,3cshyp,igncom1,5,Fri Jul 10 18:22:16 2015 UTC,"Unless GW has other plans they're stupidly not revealing despite the reactions in the Fantasy community. I don't know that even GW would be dumb enough to create a massive advertisement for a piece of their IP that people can't get their hands on. I can't help but wonder if we'll see some other fantasy shit coming out around the time TW:Warhammer releases.  But maybe they are that dumb, what do I know. I'm just a commenter on the internet."
Warhammer,3cshyp,Darkjediben,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:26:15 2015 UTC,The thing is we just won't know until shortly before any changes. I don't expect full on release schedules but a little info would be nice.

I wouldn't be surprised if we end up getting a supplement for AoS that'll give people the option to play large-scale regimented battles again.  I can't imagine anyone - even GW - being unable to predict that a total reboot of the game would piss off a lot of veterans, and doing this alongside TW:W would go a long way towards calming some people down, and even attract some new players.  It's not like it would be impossible with the change to round bases, either - GW already has movement trays for round bases that they developed for War of the Ring, so they could just rebrand those for AoS, make some new ones for different base sizes (like the new 32mm ones), and presto.  Then again, I also wouldn't be surprised if GW just said ""fuck you"" and left the WHFB old guard out in the cold on this one."
Warhammer,3cshyp,sinndogg2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Age of Sigmar is younger than WH: Total War.  WH:TW must've been in production for quite a few years, those games  are massive. To account for magic, flying units and the different kind of playstyles of all the races, major overhauls to the engine must've been done, which take time.  I'm guessing Games Workshop ordered the game, gave them the guidelines and set Creative Assembly to work, and then some time (a year-ish maybe?) later decided to change Warhammer with the End Times and Age of Sigmar. By the time GW knew what direction they would be headed, it would be a waste of money to scrap everything CA had done, since Age of Sigmar is such a different beast. So they stuck to the Old World."

Seems like people didn't communicate at all."
Warhammer,3cshyp,Groundpenguin,8,Mon Jul 13 13:15:40 2015 UTC,"Truth. WFB players have been waiting a game like this for a long, long time. About as long as 40k players have wanted a Battlefield: 40k.   The fact that this is being made by CA is just a huge bonus and a great sign! I am very optimistic about how this game could go. Cant wait to get that campaign mode up and running!"
Warhammer,3cshyp,DoctorDH,6,Fri Jul 10 14:26:57 2015 UTC,"I would argue I'd much prefer a Total War: Warhammer 40,000 over a Battlefield: 40k. I never liked the idea that one individual in a 40k battle/war can change the outcome, aside from primarchs, especially considering 40k tabletop battles are supposed to represent a small skirmish on a massive battlefield (as shown in EPIC 40k) and that 40k has titans and the like.   EPIC 40k is always how I envision that universe so a TW: WH40k would be simply fantastic."
Warhammer,3cshyp,MajorAnubis,10,Fri Jul 10 16:16:29 2015 UTC,Total war isn't fitting to the 40k style. Why it works with fantasy is the whole army block system of fantasy where everything moves and turns as one solid unit where 40k is all about single unit micro which is why it works so well with rts.
Warhammer,3cshyp,mettalica_101,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like some creative freedom could be worked into a 40k game, ensuring the groups don't move in square formations, but simply groups with a set distance from each other. Think 100 small circles able to move within one massive circle."
Warhammer,3cshyp,MajorAnubis,2,Sat Jul 11 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"Could you imagine firing at a wave of tyranids coming at you with dozens getting ripped up by heavy bolters and flamers with grand volleys of lasguns going off like hail stones on a car roof, commissars screaming over the battlefield blaze ""Purge the Xenos scum!"", and the unnerving chittering of the swarms closing in. Bio-plasma weapons start opening up on the line and guardsmen start dropping and screaming, blood is starting to fleck your screen and then you hear ""They've got into the trenches!"". You look quickly to the side and see guardsmen getting ripped apart by genestealers moving so fast you can almost not see them as they spring from man to man with sections of the line starting to break and run while commissars start shooting the fleeing cowards in the back. You start running back when all of a sudden you get thrown to the ground as a drop-pod slams down in front of you. You open your eyes to a gaunt running towards you. Just as it gets within pouncing distance it explodes in front of you and an 8-foot tall blood red Space Marine bounds past you. You hear the cries of your still living comrades shouting in relief ""The Space Marines are here!"".  And the shooting system feels like shooting in Red Orchestra. One or two shots puts someone down, body goes limp with a simple death animation. Really the whole combat system could come from there."

Warhammer,3cshyp,MajorAnubis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"For me personally, the most fascinating part of the 40k story is taking regular ordinary people without even real training and putting them in these horrible, hell-ish, unimaginably bad situations and being forced to deal with them. To me, the experience of a regular guardsmen is the most interesting way of experiencing the universe.   I don't really want to play Nid's until the technology has gone far enough to give us the ability to use tens of thousands of unique models on screen. Anything less than controlling a true swarm wouldn't do the tyranids justice (in my eyes). And I've played enough games where you're a ""hivemind""."

I would LOVE to command entire hive fleets over a planet, dispersing all levels of Tyranid across it where strengths are needed, Lictors where high value targets have been seen and need to be wiped out. TW:WH40K would be an epic clusterfuck of fun, just trying to hold a planet."
Warhammer,3cshyp,MajorAnubis,2,Sat Jul 11 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"That just sounds like a HoI 3 Mod to me now. I want to be ground level seeing people getting chewed up, feeling completely weak and vulnerable feeling like I'm hamstrung by the incompetent dumbass orders of a guy who doesn't know what to do other than yell litanies he heard a decade ago.   You're right, maybe that's why people play different armies (though I've recently been interested in starting a Tyranid army) but I feel like 40k games have really missed out on showing the experiences of the common man. It's always a space marine or grand general leading the story. I want to play the game where I have no idea where I'm fighting, or why I'm fighting or how long I have to fight for or what I'm going to be fighting.

Warhammer,3cshyp,MajorAnubis,2,Sat Jul 11 22:09:23 2015 UTC,That's what I don't want. I don't want to zoom out.

There have been plenty of good and bad warhammer games but GW are still going strong.  I think we'll just have to wait and see. The most successful Warhammer game to date is the DoW franchise because it appealed to people outside the small Gw fanbase, others have generally failed to do so (See; Space Marine). So it's success hinges on its appeal to the general gamer crowd.  How has TWW been received over at totalwar?"
Warhammer,3cshyp,Sheldonzilla,7,Fri Jul 10 12:39:15 2015 UTC,"Generally favorable. People seem to be cautiously optimistic, though some are convinced it'll be awful since it isn't historical."

So I think it's all good for GW in the long run since I'm an example of someone being pulled in from one thing that caught my at random.
Warhammer,3cshyp,PowerrangerJedi,14,Tue Jul 14 05:17:01 2015 UTC,I still think it should be called Total Warhammer.
Warhammer,3cshyp,GreyTemplar,8,Fri Jul 10 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"This is going to be huge for Warhammer. I believe it could be as successful, if not more than, DoW series. It's exactly what fantasy needed as a game."
Warhammer,3cshyp,gwarsh41,7,Fri Jul 10 12:45:07 2015 UTC,"I am wondering now, if people who play this game, will look for the old regimental style of fantasy, only to be greeted with Age of Sigmar. Though, nothing says you cannot regiment, just  no real bonus to it."
Warhammer,3cshyp,GreyTemplar,2,Fri Jul 10 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"Video game wise, Total War is all about regimental combat and formations. So I'm not worried about Age of Sigmar bleed in there.   Now if you're referring ot out of game. They could always pick up 8th edition and an army off ebay. There's also Kings of War by Mantic Games. A new 2.0 ruleset is coming out, and its also regimental fantasy combat. Sadly, no Skaven knock off as of yet though :/"
Warhammer,3cshyp,gwarsh41,4,Fri Jul 10 13:55:25 2015 UTC,"I was more worried for the disappointment people would feel when they look for warhammer fantasy and it isn't regimental. Lots of 40k players seem to come from Dawn of War, and Total Warhammer seems like the perfect entry point for fantasy.   As you said though, 8th edition and kings of war are totally viable."
Warhammer,3cshyp,GreyTemplar,6,Fri Jul 10 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a weird time to just completly destroy the way Fantasy is. Personally I thought AoS would have been a good point for me to jump on the band wagon, then I realized how wrong I was.   If I want a skirmish game, I'll play Infinity or Warmachine.

Better AI than all of the past games too, Attila was well-received.  R2 eventually got patched with Emperor Edition, and the latest patch beta was released yesterday."
Warhammer,3cshyp,chrisps989,2,Sat Jul 11 05:58:08 2015 UTC,I understand that. And I have really tried to get into both games. But there is a clear difference in the fun had between playing Shogun 2 and Rome 2. In a Shogun the economic side of things were a means to improve your fighting ability. In Rome 2 I end up fighting just to sustain my economy.
Warhammer,3cshyp,Red-Sabre,3,Sat Jul 11 13:19:41 2015 UTC,"That's way more representative of the Roman Empire than otherwise. In one game, you're a Daimyo trying to become the new Shogun of Japan. You won't be needing a gigantic economy able to sustain millions of people.   In R2, you should be fighting to sustain your economy (though just building the right buildings helps too!), the Roman Empire had notable difficulties with keeping their population fed and their Legions busy (otherwise they might mutiny and cause civil wars)."
Warhammer,3cshyp,mrsc0tty,2,Sat Jul 11 19:53:26 2015 UTC,"I understand exactly where you are coming from, I really do. Now its very possible I don't understand R2 and A:TW very well but I have to camp an army in a region for years before it becomes stable enough so that rebellions don't happen. Now to me TW games were always about the battles. The grand strat side was just a means to get you to the battle. People always shit on Empire and Nap, but I always enjoyed those two. 5 or 6 turns after taking a major province the revolt risk wasn't a problem anymore. Didn't have to worry about sanitation or the population getting outraged because you built a fishing port. Now for me all the economic stuff isn't as fun as it is in say Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis. The streamlining that happened in Shogun 2 made it the best in the series, but again that's just my opinion."

Warhammer,3cshyp,ehManiacal,2,Fri Jul 10 17:19:59 2015 UTC,I'm kind of indifferent about it.  I've played several TW games and honestly - all of them - just become tedious after some time.  Despite how much I initially loved TW and how much I enjoy WHFB I just can't see myself playing TW:WH.
Warhammer,3cshyp,mrsc0tty,2,Fri Jul 10 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"We'll see, CA is a de cent developer but they aren't the best often take as many steps backwards as they do forwards. The game will also be milked hardcore for DLC and TBH CA's DLC factions haven't been great quality (usually just half-assed reskins of some existing units, if that).  We'll see, hopefully it does it justice, regardless though I won't be getting it at release and will wait for a complete/GOTY edition on sale."
Warhammer,3cshyp,BattleSneeze,2,Sat Jul 11 01:32:25 2015 UTC,"It really makes perfect sense.  They haven't wanted to make a PC game too much like how the tabletop game plays because they didn't want the digital game eating into their tabletop profits.

I love rome 2 because it introduced so many new elements-War Dogs, Chariots, etc-and I had fun creating goofy armies I could use to carve up unsuspecting opponents. My personal favorite was back when you could put war dogs on boats and they would board enemy vessels in a tide of deadly canine bodies. The best part was the handlers wouldn't be on the boat-it would be a ship totally crewed by dogs. I had a whole K-9 navy in my first rome campaign.   TW: warhammer looks to be EXACTLY my kind of the game."

Just a shame what GW did with the game, cancelling that ambition.  Edit: I'll just say I'm going to buy TW:W. I want this. So much."
Warhammer,3cshyp,chrisps989,2,Sun Jul 12 22:31:37 2015 UTC,Pretty excited to see how CA handles a fantasy game after doing historical wargames for so long. However I won't be preordering until I see a final build of the game after the messy state Rome 2 was and still is in.
Warhammer,3cshyp,Mikkidahh,5,Fri Jul 10 17:06:38 2015 UTC,Rome 2 had a rough launch but it is no longer a mess at all. CA worked very hard to fix their game and it has been fixed for quite some time now.

Warhammer,3cshyp,Harukiller14,8,Fri Jul 10 13:52:06 2015 UTC,Not really. 40k wouldn't work in a Total War game and I think they should just let relic work on 40k stuff.
Warhammer,3cshyp,paulHarkonen,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"Eh?  I think it works alright but would require some significant restructuring.  The translation from cities to planets or systems is reasonable, naval combat becomes space combat (although it would need to be seriously reworked) and ground combat is still ground combat (although again, it would need to be refined even more than the empire total war changes).  I think the system as it exists is best for fantasy, but I don't think it's unreasonable for them to make a 40k one."
Warhammer,3cshyp,Harukiller14,3,Fri Jul 10 17:56:41 2015 UTC,I think you're over simplifying what it takes to code something up like that. I don't think it's something you can just fix in the current engine. It would take a complete overhaul. The only thing I can think of that has automatic weapons similar to 40k on a total war engine is The Great War mod for Nepoleon and it looks ridiculous. 40k is about squad tactics and once you get that low on scale it's just better for it to be a traditional rts like Dawn Of War.
Warhammer,3cshyp,paulHarkonen,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:17:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to suggest the current engine could just have a coat of 40K paint slapped on top and call it done.  Instead what I was suggesting was that the 40K universe could work reasonably well in a Total War style game, given the significant modifications I highlighted.  I think a lot would need to change, but the skeleton of a turn based territory control game with real time combat to secure key objectives would work well for 40K.  In fact, Dawn of War moved to a campaign with that style to it since it makes more sense in universe than building units on the ground does for the lord.  I don't think it would be easy, but it certainly could work if it seemed like a worthwhile investment from CA.  I agree that the 40K miniatures game is about squad warfare, but that universe has plenty of large scale combat that could work well in a Total War style strategy game."

Skitarii Alphas can't take special weapons, so you'd have to drop the plasma cavaliers. I'd recommend taking a Phase Taser for your Vanguard Alpha - it makes him a fairly effective combat asset if you need a last-ditch charge.  You might want to consider swapping a unit of Breachers to have Torsion Cannons - they're very reliable anti-tank, and give you some longer range bite. It also seems slightly wasteful to take the War Convocation and not take advantage of those plasma blasts, so a unit of Destroyers would be rad."
Warhammer,3cvggw,ParanoidEngi,2,Sun Jul 12 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"I actually looked it over just before making the list, the Skitarii Battle Maniple is 1 unit or Ballistari or 1 unit of Dragoons. So, I'm fine on the skitarii battle maniple's requirements. Vanguard/Ranger alphas may also take ""from the Ranged Weapons, Melee, Weapons, Special Issue Wargear and Relics of Mars lists."" so they can take plasmas with them, though adding a phase taser to their kits will be nice (I also need to change out their invuln shields to the 4++ one, their unit doesn't take the blind test, as per the blind special rule)"

Warhammer,3csmn4,ReaperOfCaliban,2,Fri Jul 10 13:28:36 2015 UTC,"You could have just deployed everything at the start of the game. By RAW, summoning just fiddles with sudden death rules, allows you to resurrect dead models and allows you to deploy models you chose not to at the start of the game.  If your adding some sort of army composition rules, summoning need to be patched too."
Warhammer,3csmn4,jimcdiver,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:35:46 2015 UTC,What does that have to do with summoning in the hero phase? Sure deploy it all then summon with them. That's not the same as infinite summoning.  My comment was my personal way to prevent infinite summoning.
Warhammer,3csmn4,ReaperOfCaliban,3,Fri Jul 10 13:38:28 2015 UTC,I'm saying by RAW I'd doesn't much matter if infinite summoning is a thing (which it is). I say this because infinite deployment is also a thing.
Warhammer,3csmn4,jimcdiver,3,Fri Jul 10 13:48:13 2015 UTC,"This guy is on point.  If you had the models to begin with, why didn't you put them on the table? If the answer is for balance, then the summoning rules are not going to give you a good game experience."
Warhammer,3csmn4,googletron,3,Fri Jul 10 13:59:16 2015 UTC,"That's my feeling. Summoning lets you place new units, which can be useful, but since points don't matter, you could have deployed anything you wanted at the beginning of the game."
Warhammer,3csmn4,locolarue,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"New game, new perspectives.   Though I'd say if you and your opponent are going for balance by agreeing on some sort of restrictions on warscrolls it would be a good idea to only let units that started the phase on the table participate."
Warhammer,3csmn4,noreservations81590,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it affects Sudden Death rules. RAW, Sudden Death rules can be chosen if your opponent has more that 1/3 models than you and Generals have been nominated, no further restrictions. It doesn't say they have to be chosen at deployment so why not elect for Sudden Death mid-game?"
Warhammer,3csmn4,OldWorldVulture,3,Fri Jul 10 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"The rules for model count states that models added via summoning do not count towards the model count of your army, but only count as losses.  So the sudden death victory conditions would only ever be determined after generals are selected since the army sizes are effectively ""locked"" at that point.  By not having summoning increase your army size summoning gets dangerous if you don't table your opponent as you now have more models to lose which would add to the percentage lost at the end if you have to determine a minor victory."
Warhammer,3csmn4,gabrieldante,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:01:09 2015 UTC,"You're right about the summoned models not counting towards your army, I hadn't considered that, thanks!  As written, the Sudden Death rule allows for 2 interpretations. 1) the word 'after' means immediately after and before anything else occurs. 2) The word 'after' is an open ended 'after' and means any point after general nomination. Until we get a FAQ the best course is to decide for yourself which you think is the most fun/balanced way to play it (Hell, even if we do get a FAQ just pick the way you prefer anyway).  Perhaps I am alone in this but, I think allowing Sudden Death to be chosen during the game (ignoring any summoned units as you pointed out) could lead to interesting and fun moments. Taken a battering and your opponent now has 1/3 more models? Make a last-chance gambit on a Sudden Death, a final desperate attempt to claw victory from the jaws of defeat. I think it could lead to some interesting moments. There is the potential for strategy in intentionally taking losses and luring a vulnerable enemy character into the open before declaring the Assassinate objective etc.  I could still be dead wrong in my rules reading so feel free to point out any errors I've made."
Warhammer,3csmn4,OldWorldVulture,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:53:43 2015 UTC,"The reason why I think it's declared at the beginning is because the rule says ""models"" and not ""surviving models"" but as you point out its rather vague. I'll be curious to see an FAQ to explain when or can be declared."
Warhammer,3csmn4,gabrieldante,2,Sun Jul 12 03:00:55 2015 UTC,"It happens after Generals have been nominated, that is the step that it happens at, not some random time of your choice in the future. That is clear-cut and obvious."

Warhammer,3csmn4,gwarsh41,3,Fri Jul 10 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"I did it a little while ago. Summoning is easier in AoS, and can really take things a little over the top of crazy pants. I also agreed with my opponents that a summoned unit can attempt a charge. 9"" charge isn't that easy to make (that didn't stop the green knight though!)  Check out the abilities for heralds of Tzeentch, and then look at the blue scribes.   Summoning is hands down the easiest thing to exploit. I try to take it in moderation. A summon or two a game, and I try to limit it to one big thing. Last game I summoned a GUO after my maggoth lord died, then some flamers. If it wasn't for them I would have been steam rolled!  Summon flamers, seriously, do it. They are amazing."
Warhammer,3csmn4,OldWorldVulture,3,Fri Jul 10 13:33:52 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Daemon Princes of Tzeentch, they are Chaos Wizards and give all Chaos Wizards the ability to summon Daemon Princes of any flavour."
Warhammer,3csmn4,thenurgler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I played a game where I had 30 extra pink horrors, a DP, and a bloodthirster (10 to summon) and guess who rolled 6's on his charge and got into combat that turn.  Yep BT Unfettered himself.  That fucking to wound ability is fantastic."
Warhammer,3csmn4,Quasari,2,Fri Jul 10 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"In 40k, summoned units can act immediately as well."
Warhammer,3csu0y,gribblewielder,2,Fri Jul 10 14:20:22 2015 UTC,If you are playing RAW there is no need to do that because you can just put all your models out on the table and go that way. If you are trying to put a point or balance system in place I would have to know what that system is based on before I could give you an answer. VC for example are pretty much entirely based around summoning and get shafted in most point systems because most do something like (wounds + attack) x bravery making a simple zombie cost 20 points and a grave gaurd 30. If thats the cast they almost need OP summining to stay relevant.
Warhammer,3csu0y,Agentwise,2,Fri Jul 10 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"My idea here isn't so much for hardcore balance but to make a summoning army of roughly equivalent models more fun to play against. At the moment summons can quickly spiral out of control; this means that summoned units are likely to be relevant when summoned rather than slowly outnumber the other player, and it encourages a divide between the 'core' army of a summons player and the chaff they throw in your path."
Warhammer,3csu0y,Agentwise,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:53:43 2015 UTC,"So if you aren't shooting for hardcore balance this is going to be very hard to answer. Theres pretty much two lines of thought here. You can make a smaller army list because you know that you will be summoning more units into the battle but this risks your opponent dispelling your summoning and completely gibbing you army. Or there needs to be a rule in place that limits the amount of summon units you can have at one time.  You could limit the number of undead a single wizard could ""control"" to something like 2 or 3 but you'd have to find the balance. You could make it so you could only have any summoning out once, for example if I summon a Zombie Dragon I can't summon any more Zombie Dragons. Maybe make an exception for zombies since I would assume you'd always be able to summon those."
Warhammer,3csu0y,InsomniaFTW,2,Fri Jul 10 15:21:18 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, totally, and it would actually be really cool for each summon to have to be unique and only castable once; do you want to get your good shit up early or wait til enemy wizards are dead? But my idea here is more to let people summon as much as they like by introducing drawbacks in the long term for summons"
Warhammer,3csu0y,Quasari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:48:57 2015 UTC,"Summoning units is rough, but already limited. Just don't allow the units of multiple wizards to join, and disallow movement and shooting for the first turn. (Odds that most successfully charge in is 1 in 6).   Summons should only be summonable if a unit with that scroll starts on the table. Killing the key unit should allow a (resonance issue or some such) that starts the wounding mechaninc you mentioned.   So, for example, you start with 3 necromancers, a unit of 30 zombies, a unit of skellies, and a unit of grave guard. You could summon 3 units of skellies in a turn, 3 grave guard units, or one of each. if the basic unit is slain, the other units have 'lost the pattern' and are now drawn back whence they came. This incentivizes your opponent to kill your units while your wizards run about, and means that you can't just summon anything.   Now, summons should not be able to summon. I'm not a fan of recursive daemons, warriors, lizzies or undead. But the system is easily workable with a few tweaks."
Warhammer,3csu0y,dooderthepooder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"Just to make sure, you know that you can only use summon spells for warscrolls that are in play (as in to summon skeletons you gotta have a unit of skeletons in play). At least that's how my group plays it (considering the warscrolls are what give the spell). Also the easiest way to stop a summoner is actually getting close to him, while the range is 18"", the cant be summoned within 9"" of an enemy, which having 3-4 units and/or spreading out can strip them of any space to summon in. Throw in getting your own mage in to counter and honestly I don't see summoning as a problem."
Warhammer,3csu0y,Quasari,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:52:06 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to this, units that are summoned count against the player that summoned them I believe. So it's not a great idea to flood with units either. Just saiyan."
Warhammer,3csu0y,dooderthepooder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:56:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if there is no army kill, it goes by casualties vs starting army. So with a summoning army your amount killed can easily get over 100%."
Warhammer,3csu0y,Gnomegrinder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:06:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I see summoning as a Last ditch effort, or a way to ensure you table your opponent. So this is well balanced in my opinion. Just not at first glance, heh."
Warhammer,3csu0y,feor1300,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:23:25 2015 UTC,"I houseruled Summoning as any Wizard in the army can summon only the units that were brought to the battle in the first place, so in a 3 scroll game theres a Lord, 10 Skellies and 10 Black Knights, the Lord can only summon the skellies or black knights, basically restricting summoning to creatures that were already present, making for more interesting list building."
Warhammer,3csu0y,LEFUNN,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:38:11 2015 UTC,"I think the best solution is just that anything you need to declare any models you intend to summon and they count as part of your army for the size of it.

Warhammer,3cvo2w,rolandgilead,3,Sat Jul 11 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"I like what you've done and I was looking into something similar myself, incorporating it into a spreadsheet to make it easy to calculate armies. (0.166 is 1 chance in 6)  At the moment I am splitting the cost into defence, offence and competence.   Defence is how hard you are to kill  =Wounds/(save*0.166) Offence is based on attacks, chance to hit, chance to wound, rending and damage  =attacks((7-ToHit)0.166)((7-ToWound)0.166)damage(1+(0.166-Rend)) Competence is a bit more difficult to pin down a decent formula. It should represent bravery and movement.  =(bravery/12+movement/12)*traits   Currently I have traits ranging from 1-10. A shitty shield or ability gets you a 1. Flying might get you another 2, then being a mage or having commands another 1-2. This is where I will need some playtesting to really refine.   The total is an addition of =10defence+10offence+10*competence  I figure having those static values may be a good point of balance if competence is a more significant factor in play. Also thinking that perhaps traits should act as some sort of force multiplier on the total rather than just competence.  Using this system a clan rate is 20pts. A Lothern Sea Guard is 35pts. I currently only have the Isle of Blood starter set and based of these initial calculations the High Elves are ahead by 500pts (1814vs1337) which is sorta similar to how the set is costed when it came out originally."

Also, the blending from black to red on the legs is nice - I've done that with Bloodthirsters and think it looks good."
Warhammer,3cq918,shauni55,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:13:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I tried to mimic make it look like a daemon from The Wrath (Khorne Daemonkin), hence the black-to-red legs. :)  For the mane I went primed it with Chaos Black then painted it Khorne Red, Evil Sunz Scarlet, Fire Dragon Bright and finished of with an extremely light drybrush of Yriel Yellow. Used less and less paint for each step to give it some diversity. So it's mostly an orange-y fur. Although I'm going to use it as Flesh Hounds, so I find it quite fitting."

They could be zombies or cultists for chaos space marines.  They could be nurgle daemons.  Also dark eldar haemonculus coven.  I actually plan on using the crypt horrors box to create grotesques for my dark eldar army.  Kit bashing them with the extra parts from the talos pain engine box.  I'm sure elements of the new plastic wracks kit (like the facemasks) could bolt right onto your existing ghouls or you could replace some of the arms with the wrack arms.    If it's vampires, you could do some neat things with eldar or dark eldar.  Blood knights might look cool riding  jetbikes.  A vampire lord on foot would make a great looking archon or Autarch if you convert him a little bit to have a scifi flair.  If it's skeletons, maybe necrons? Grave guard could be made into lychguard.  A chariot could be an annihilation barge?  I dunno that is stretching it.    It honestly depends on how far you want to take it.  If you just want to plop your existing fantasy models on the table and say ""this is 40k now"", it might not be that enjoyable for your opponent.  The proper way to do it would be to buy some new kits for whatever 40k army you decide, build and paint them, then take all the extra bits from those kits and convert some of your existing fantasy models to match them."

Warhammer,3cszvg,llawinga,10,Fri Jul 10 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"35-40 dollars to rent a GW quality army for a weekend? assuming army to be 1000-1500 points.... This is an extreme low ball price, not even thinking of GW's usual price standards.  You've got to think about how much it would cost them to create hundreds of armies, thousands of models and put them together and pro paint them. All that man hour time.... And then trusting people with these armies? heck i barely trust my friends with my armies, i've seen the way they handle and carry their minis. GW would get back nothing but broken models, repainted models, or not get back models at all.  Sorry to be such a downer but this idea has so many downsides to it, its not feasible.   Warhammer is an expensive game, if you only have 40-50$, buy a unit of figures, paint them up and get them table ready and then play alongside other people, then next check get another unit set up."
Warhammer,3cszvg,OnceAmongTheFence,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:53:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, the price was just throwing something out there. I'd stop thinking about it GW's perspective and think about it from your own: would you like to play with a totally different, fully-painted army for a week? How much would you pay for it? At some price point, there is a viable business. The rest is logistics. Think about FlightCar. You drop off your car at the airport, they rent it out to other drivers. (You get free parking and a little money.) There are logistical problems, but it's a growing business.  Re: size, no reason to start with hundreds of armies. Start small, beta-test the concept and grow it as you get better at shipping, logistics, pricing. Start adding more armies, etc.  As a 30-something professional, I could go out today and buy an entire army. But I couldn't paint it in a reasonable amount of time. And next month I may decide I want to play as something else. Why the hell do I want to invest so much time and money in one army? And Games Workshop isn't getting rich by selling one model kit every two weeks to high school kids. My suggestion is that they could make money by renting the same model kit dozens of times to people."
Warhammer,3cszvg,mirbler,2,Fri Jul 10 21:23:06 2015 UTC,"This ignores the biggest problem, theft. I go online, use a fake name and a pre-paid visa to ""rent"" an army, have it shipped to a friend or family member(heck even a GW store in another town and tell them I'm having a home game). Pick it up and now I have a ~$1000.00 army for ~$50-100. Assuming GW's costs on the army are around $400-$500 after painting/basing, ignoring the retail markup, that is still a huge loss that isn't worth the risk. The more difficult you make to rent an army to less likely you are to get new players to actually try it, thus defeating the purpose."
Warhammer,3cszvg,TheZardoz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"As soon as I read this I thought yep, this would be a huge problem. They could require ID and only do pickup from GW stores and this would still be an issue."

Warhammer,3cszvg,ReaperOfCaliban,2,Sat Jul 11 01:11:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, some people would steal minis and some would accidentally break some.

It'll cost you $1 per point you rent ;)"
Warhammer,3cszvg,Darkjediben,7,Fri Jul 10 15:17:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's a remarkably stupid idea. Anybody who wants to try out an army can always and has always just sub in other shit, or just make paper bases. It's not that difficult. Add in the wear and tear of shipping models, unknown handling on the renter's side, the cost of repairing and repainting due to handling, people not packing them correctly to send them back, and your insanely low price point? Nope. Never gonna happen, and you clearly didn't think it out very well."
Warhammer,3cszvg,AetherGauntlet,2,Fri Jul 10 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry you feel that way. I threw the idea out there to get opinions on it. (I did find a ""Netflix for boardgames"" company, which would have similar concerns but they seem to be growing.)   Good packaging and shipping damage are big issues - but they are not insurmountable problems. Netflix spent a lot of time and energy on similar issues - proper packaging, shipping, customer damage, etc. You have the credit card information on file, you can charge damage to the customer. Or if the customer has too many problems, you cut them off.  Price is also variable. I threw a price out there, but obviously a lot of work would need to go into making a correct pricing model. GW threw away a gaming universe, but I'm just wondering if they had to...or if a alternative revenue model could have saved the brand."
Warhammer,3cszvg,Darkjediben,2,Fri Jul 10 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"One of the main issues is the cost per ""unit"" and what happens when a ""unit"" is lost due to shipping, damages, etc.  One DVD is ~25$, a boardgame is ~75$ and a small painted army is ~1000$."
Warhammer,3cszvg,Zel1988,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"See my response to /u/onceamongthefence.  Also, two quick things: First, that's retail - unlike Netflix or BGEX, who had to buy retail - GW's product cost would be significantly less without markup (the painting adds a lot, but again, test in small batches). Second, we're trying to grow the pie - more players, trying more, then buying more."

Warhammer,3cq46f,tacomaster11,3,Thu Jul 9 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mix and match Dev weapons.  Go all 4 the same unless you are running 10 men and combat squadding. Anything you will be sniping with lascannons, is more than likely out of range for grav cannons. Anything in range of grav cannons, well 2 gravcannons with amps is more than enough to break most vehicles short of a land raider or knight.  Powerfists are next to useless on marine sgts...but if you insist on running one, you pretty much have to give him the vsgt upgrade so he can get 3 attacks on the charge. Otherwise he stands to just whiff everything...or die before he hits but thats a different story.  Can't take sternguards in the demi company formations. Drop them and maybe drop a few of the power weapons here and there and you can cram in that storm raven. Would also find 10 pts somewhere and get skyhammers on the stormtalons, cause rockets are epic and fluffy and just overall better than TL Hbolters.  Just a heads up, only units that can take razorbacks, rhinos or drop pods get them free...so your centurion dev squad does not get anything."
Warhammer,3cq46f,jimtheclowned,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:51:55 2015 UTC,"I've heard dont mix and match dev squads, I put it like that because I'd only bought one dev squad--changed it to four las cannons and freed some points up. Same reason I put the sternguard on there--because I had them. I axed the sternguard (gonna use the models as command squad vets) and downgraded my chapter master to captain and was able to fit the storm raven and upgrade the seargeant to a vet sergeant."
Warhammer,3cq46f,scientist_tz,2,Thu Jul 9 22:56:34 2015 UTC,Use the missile launcher from the tac squad sprues to run 2xLascannon 2xMissile Devs. Still not ideal but at least they range out the same.
Warhammer,3cq46f,Tzelanit,2,Fri Jul 10 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"In order to get the free transports, you have to have one of the auxiliary formations beyond the two Demi Companies. You've almost got a Storm Wing unless I'm missing seeing a Storm Raven in there. Also, without the Storm Raven, the list would be Unbound. While I don't think this list is trying to be overpowered, Unbound isn't usually looked well on, because of the stupid things you can do with it. But if the guys you play with are fine with it, it's fine. Though I think you've gone overboard on Grav, I'd swap some of that out for Plasma if this is supposed to be an all-comers list.  As far as the Reclusiam Command Squad goes, Units have to be allocated to a single Detachment or Formation, so even though you've got all the units for the RCS, they're already allocated to the Demi Company, and you wouldn't get the RCS special rules."
Warhammer,3cq46f,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay. If I move some stuff around, I should be able to afford the storm raven. Thank you for the advice!"
Warhammer,3cq46f,ANakedBear,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:28:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right now that list simply doesn't work since you are unbound due to the sternguard, stormtalons, and lack of aux formation. While you could run the list and get the Battle Demi-Company benefits you wouldn't get fee transports since that's a Gladius detachment benefit which isn't awarded to unbound armies.   Easiest way to make it battleforged is to remove sternguard entirely and drop a bunch of the power weapons/fists and stormbolters of the tac sergeants. The squads with grav guns want to get into position ASAP and not move anyways so those would be ideal.   That frees up enough points for the stormraven which gives you an aux formation and a ride for the grav cents. (Just hope that your reserve rolls play nice...)  I'd also consider a tac squad with just a heavy weapon to sit on a home objective (though the devs can do that too if you want to make them an even bigger target)    Also, you really need to do something with the command squad. If you want to get them into melee with the HQ's I'd recommend a couple stormshields and power weapons/fists. In that case I'd consider sticking them into the stormraven instead of the cents. Alternatively drop the champion (he isn't all that good anyways) and give them all special weapons to create an awesome firing base (that works best if you stick them on bikes though which ups the cost to 200+)"

If the glue still sticks just use burning hot water, it distends the material thus weakening the glue bonds.  It's a matter of waiting, you aren't going to find whatever you are after at the price you want the very first day/week.

Toastinator makes a valid point that what you're proposing is actually not that different from the rulebook advises, but explaining it in terms of a draft process made it much clearer what GW was trying to get at.   It also explains why they were never that worried about the units being unbalanced - you're meant to take the initiative to balance it yourself.  The main thing that needs to be resolved then is how to create meaningful victory conditions, because just tallying up the number of wounds on each side doesn't make a whole lot of sense."

Warhammer,3cq3aq,feor1300,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:27:05 2015 UTC,"I think tallying wounds is fine for basic ""lets beat the snot out of each other"" games.

Warhammer,3cq3aq,toastinator,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"So, the only thing you've changed from the actual rules is an agreement on a set number of ""drafting rounds"". In the rules as they are currently, you roll a dice to determine who goes first, then alternate placing units down."
Warhammer,3cq3aq,Zirgoth,3,Thu Jul 9 23:19:02 2015 UTC,"Not quite.  In the rules you alternate deployment of units during ""set-up"", and use space on the battlefield to determine when you're done, leaving anything else in reserve i.e. probably not used.   I'm suggesting that before all of that, when you get together, and before terrain or deployment sides are chosen, you balance your forces by this drafting procedure, culled from each of your collections.  Also, in each round the player who drafts first alternates, so you aren't in a situation where one player is drafting units entirely in response to the player who wins the roll.    After all of that is done, then you can use the ""set-up"" rules to deploy as they suggest."
Warhammer,3cq3aq,Darkuwa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"I know that I'm quite late to the party, but I have some suggestions for a variant on the drafting process.  You and you're opponent brings a predetermined amount of warscrolls, of which at least 2 has to be capable of being a commander in total.  You then take turns drafting from the total warscrolls (not just your own) for a predetermined number of drafting rounds. A player can at any point during this process stop drafting in the hopes of getting a sudden death objective.  This method should ensure that no player is horribly outmatched by an opponent who just happened to own considerably better models."
Warhammer,3cq3aq,Darkuwa,-3,Fri Jul 10 10:35:41 2015 UTC,"That is basically the same as saying x warscrolls and choosing what to have in your army during deployment which is how the rules already work other than the equal number of scrolls limit.  Only real way to balance is to assign points, which I have done: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4wN-6BdRhC5Wm56VXhmSmliRmc/edit?usp=docslist_api"
Warhammer,3cq3aq,BlakBat,2,Thu Jul 9 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the point is to draft unit by unit so that you can choose units that you can judge as reasonably good counters to what your opponents choose, as opposed to just throwing a bunch of units from both collections at each other with little more than model or wound count.  That's why drafting in rounds can be helpful, particularly if you look at the process as part of generalship in a different way than building lists ahead of time.  But if you want to make points to play with, go ahead!  Just thought I'd put this out there."
Warhammer,3cq3aq,Veritor,0,Thu Jul 9 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"But when you deploy you choose a unit to put down then your opponent does back and forth, which is pretty much what you're suggesting."
Warhammer,3cq3aq,BlakBat,2,Fri Jul 10 00:07:17 2015 UTC,Not exactly; see my response to toastinator for the distinction.
Warhammer,3cq3aq,Veritor,-3,Fri Jul 10 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"I watched many reviews and comments and criticism on AOS. Even downloaded and read the rules.  I'm sorry, but even if GW gave me money to play AOS I wouldn't accept the deal. I prefer giving my hard earned cash to play an unbalanced 40K (I play BA ...) than to even try to play AOS which seems more than broken and more unbalanced than every edition of 40K to date combined."
Warhammer,3cq3aq,BlakBat,4,Thu Jul 9 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"I've been reading over this a lot with a friend, and we both enjoy Analyzing. So far, the rules are actually extraordinarily balanced. A lot of the balance happens sneakily, within the scrolls or the way certain rules interact. Sure, nothing to stop your opponent bringing 5 scrolls of elite models. Heck, there is even a High Elf Formation of 3 Dragons. But with your three single-models, i'll bring 3 scrolls that synergise with eachother and focus fire. And the big beasties lose power as they are hurt.  The best 40k way to think of it, is imagine that your opponent has 5 imperial knights. but that all you weapons can wound it on a 5+. sure, their tough. Sure, you're going to take lumps. but you'll wear it down through sheer volume."

Braying Warcry: Red-hot rage festers in    the savage minds of Wargors, their only    desire to rend and destroy.

Warhammer,3cpjby,TheCountryJournal,3,Thu Jul 9 19:11:40 2015 UTC,"I always interpreted it as the Tau version of Seppuku, the commander kills him/herself as a result of being responsible for egregious loss of life. It is probably disturbing because of the brutality of the ritual."
Warhammer,3cpjby,steampunkjesus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:58:42 2015 UTC,"An interesting theory in which to base that act on. It would fit closely with with Japanese culture, which writers of the Tau lore took heavy license and inspiration from. However, the codex states that an Ethereal is involved in some capacity.   While I suppose the Ethereal could sanction a commander to commit Seppuku, wouldn't that remove the element of free will? In other words, isn't a commander supposed to end his own life without being forced or persuaded to, in order to attempt to retrieve some semblance of honour in death?"
Warhammer,3cpjby,sam-29-01-14,2,Thu Jul 9 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"Well, in Seppuku, a samurai would nominate a 'second' to assist in his death.  Following a ceremonial meal he would take his tanto dagger (similar to the knife conveniently carried by all bonded Tau Fire-Caste you will notice) and plunge it into his belly, cutting from side to side. At the first sign that the samurai may disgrace himself by crying out in pain, or faltering in the cut, his second would draw his blade and take off his head, leaving a small flap of skin at the front, so that the head did not roll around on the floor and cause offence.  Historically a second would be a close friend, or in rarer cases (for a captured samurai perhaps) an enemy who had been impressed by the nobility of the disgraced foe. Perhaps in Tau societies the Ethereals take the role of the second."

Warhammer,3cpjby,BrotherToaster,6,Thu Jul 9 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"The only mention seems to be on p. 23 in the new Tau Codex.   'While sacrifice for the Greater Good is considered heroic, unnecessary losses are disdained. Even after leading a cadre to a remarkable victory, a Commander whose army has sustained a large amount of casualties that might have been prevented does not rejoice, but is instead greatly shamed. Duty requires that he ask to step down and rejoin the ranks to atone for his failure. If the breach of conduct is more severe, the Ethereals themselves might step in and demand the Malk'la ritual, an event that scars all who witness it.'"

Warhammer,3cq42u,Ge0Tex,3,Thu Jul 9 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty good. I have some suggestions, but they're opinions only, and dependent on what the meta in your area is.  I think the 10 combi-meltas in the Sternguard is probably overkill. And I'm not a huge fan of taking a combi-melta over a melta. They're the same points, but while the special ammo offers some versatility, I think in most cases you'd just be better off shooting melta again. So I'd suggest swapping two combi-meltas for meltas, and a few combi-meltas for combi-flamers, as a better loadout against all comers. I'd also merge the two squads into one, to save the 35 points on the second Drop Pod. They can still combat squad to split when they land, and I need the points for something later.  I'd dump the combi-plasma on the Lascannon squad. I think it's unlikely to be useful, but I don't really have a specific argument against it, so whatever. That goes for the Dev combi too. Other than that the Tac Squads are fine.  Flakk missiles are terrible and over-priced. At 1000 points flyers are unlikely to be an issue, and the ones you might actually have to worry about at this point level are AV 12, which flakk is even worse against. If you need AA though, dumping the Flakk and the DP gives you enough for a Hunter, a way better AA choice."
Warhammer,3cq42u,Tzelanit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback also. The meta in my area seems to be made up of Tyranids, Dark Angels, Imperial guard, Sisters of Battle, Chaos Space Marines, Space Wolves, Grey Knights and possibly Eldar. So its those kind of armies I need to be prepared for.  From what you've said I can see that having all Combi-Melta's was foolish, I gave them all Combi-Melta's over regular Melta's because I feared that the Sternguard would suffer in range considering that Melta's have only a 12"" range. But their job is to break the enemy lines and hit their vehicles and other high priority targets so they'll be in close proximity to the enemy anyway so yes Melta's are a better choice, plus they'll need those Flamers you suggested for the inevitable counter-attack the enemy launches after I (hopefully) wipe out their heavy support. Merging the squads would also be a good idea which would save 35 pts.  I agree with dumping the Combi-Plasma on the Lascannon squad as it may not be in range to be used considering the original intention for that squad was to hold an objective close to my deployment zone, the same goes for the Devastator squad I agree they don't need a combi because they'll be keeping back too.  I'm not sure if I'll need AA support, I only included it so that the Devastators could be effective against all targets: infantry, vehicles and aircraft. But since the Flakk missiles are no good anyway then I'll just dump them and which to a Hunter (Or a Stalker) if I need AA support. Your feedback has been very helpful thank you."
Warhammer,3cq42u,GorgeousGoat,2,Fri Jul 10 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you have Combi-Plasma on your Devastators and your 2nd Tac (LC) squad.  I'd either drop those two and the flakk missiles, giving you further points for a rhino for the second squad and you could give the first a drop-pod - so that they can support the sternguards too.   How would this list deal with hordes (AM/IG or Orks) when you have no flamers, I'd say drop the LC - get a Flamer and Combi-Flamer - DP on an objective and say 'Come at me bro'.  P.s. Maybe look at some Heavy Bolters for your devastators for synergy with your Chapter Tactic - 'Bolter Drill', they still get IF tactics yah?"
Warhammer,3cq42u,Tzelanit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback. I can see where you're coming from and you're entirely correct that my army would be weak against a horde type army (Ironic considering Crimson Fists are meant to be specialists in dealing with hordes like the Orks). Also, pardon my ignorance, what does AM stand for?   The Devastators would have had two Heavy Bolters and two Missile Launchers as you have stated but the general feeling I got from forums online was that Heavy Bolter's weren't all that effective so I steered clear but I could incorporate them into the squad for use as anti-infantry. (And yes Crimson Fists do make use of Imperial Fist tactics)   The second tactical squad (With the Lascannon) was meant to be home-objective holders sitting back and taking pot-shots at vehicles and strong infantry but I could change them to be anti-horde objective holders instead as you've suggested. Thank you again for your critique."
Warhammer,3cq42u,GorgeousGoat,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:07 2015 UTC,"AM is Astra Militarum, GW's new trademarkable name for Imperial Guard.  I like HB Devs as well, but I prefer to start with Lascannons, which you'll have the points for if you're dropping the combis. Imperial Fists also get Tank Hunters on their Dev squads, so Lascannons with them are really good.  Maybe swap the Lascannon in the Tac squad with a HB, to give you long range anti-infantry. That added to a few combi-flamers in the Sternguard should give you the tools to deal with whatever comes up. If you don't think you need the AA, maybe get a bike squad or a pair of attack bikes with those points to have a mobile squad."

Sigmar was/is either the Emperor himself, something similar, or maybe one of the lost primarchs. What makes this single planet special enough to have constant waves of chaos and Sigmar (whatever he may be) fighting over it is unknown.

So Elves and Eldar are not the same, but they are equivalent beings in different realities.  The Emperor isn't Sigmar, but the two are equivalent beings.  The Daemon special characters, and the Chaos Gods, however, are the same beings in both games.  Similarly, objects (for example, a bolter carried by a khornate warrior) might travel through the Warp and end up in the WHFB world."

Warhammer,3cmqe6,BloodBride,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"It's the compelling and awesome stories that GW has put out that make me more resistant to Age of Sigmar personally. I read both the Von Carstein trilogy and the Ulrika the Vampire trilogy, and the way that people fight for their homes, resist the forces that oppose them, have personal politics, have personal feelings... I hate that the entire planet died. It made all of that worthless and meaningless. Even if the world has been hinted at dead for ages, it's the final act that takes it too far... Like in 40k, the Imperium and the Emperor are dying... I don't think I'd be okay with the fallout of it actually happening. Only with Fantasy, it's so much grander because the planet they lost was the only one they had."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,Deacon523,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't understand why the planet dying makes those stories worthless or meaningless.  Just because something comes to an end doesn't suddenly end it's value, especially when the ending of fantasy reflected all those points about fighting for homes and personal feelings etc. Like... Did you even read the end times?"
Warhammer,3cmqe6,BloodBride,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"It's because the people often fought to protect their homes and their families. Those homes are all gone. The defence of Altdorf how many times... all for naught, as Altdorf is gone.  Nuln, defended from the Orcs and the Skaven, then beseiged by Vampire... Even as the primary source of weapons manufacturing for the Empire, she is gone. The forests of the Dryads, ancient as they are, home to such rare and precious creatures... shattered. All the way up to and into the End Times, people fought to defend their homes... And all of them, everyone's homes, crumbled and fell down. Most of the characters we knew of met their ultimate deaths. Some good, some bad. But when the planet shattered, at least some of those left unaccounted for likely also met an untimely fate. It all vanished. All those efforts were wasted. All the anger, hatred, sorrow and heartache gave way to... the entire world ceasing to exist.     Some small, shattered part of those peoples still exist... though in far different a form - The remnants of Humanity, no longer the Empire, lead by Sigmar himself returned, with it's vaulted high palace and large ornate heroic armours is not its former self. We can expect then that the others are also not their old selves... They exist now as an echo - similar to the original, but... distorted, changed in some way...  With part of the original lost in the confusion. Part of the charm of the old world was the world itself. That's gone now."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,Deacon523,2,Thu Jul 9 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, I feel like the end times invalidated all the lore that had been built up over decades.   Yes, the stories still exist, but now that we know the ending, it isn't as interesting.   It is no longer escapist fantasy, it is just history.   Worse, you can go back and read the books, but there will never be another sequel.   It's over."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,BloodBride,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"Well, it's also that we know those things came to nothing. In one of the books, we're introduced to the last Dwarf of Karak Sadra (may have been a slightly different name) - He was a prince, but the very last one of his people as all others had passed on in a Vampire attack. He stood up to be counted and fought against Konrad AND Manfred, surviving it. And you have to wonder... Does he reclaim Karak Sadra? Does he find himself a Queen and start over? Does he live a nomadic life as a Slayer? Does his Karak fold into another family? And now... None of that matters. His, and every other Karak (seems to be Dwarvish for 'house') blew the fuck up when the planet errupted.    Or what of Jerek von Carstein, who defied the will of his blood and fought against Mannfred? He believed no Vampire should ever hold the Von Carstein ring, and had himself buried with the ring hidden within a tomb wall where no one would ever find him, as the only person who knew his location was mortal and old. In the End Times, Vlad has his ring back. No explanation, he just... has it now. So... what was that sacrifice for? What did it all mean?   Too slow in dwelling on it, Vlad gave the ring to Isabella, jumped off a fortress wall (again. Dude should've invented bungee jumping.) and then the planet blew up, too late to care about it.    And what about Nagash, the ultimate master of undeath, the first Necromancer, the one who even the Dark Elves went ""dude, that's too fucking far.""? He came back and it was like the start of Power Rangers, just ""Haaaa, after ten million years I'm free, time to conquer Earth!"" and then... nope, you died when some idiot tried to absorb an ENTIRE wind of magic, tough luck. Remember when Nagash was spoken about in hushed tongues because he'd bring about an age of undeath and would change the world forever? Yeah. This isn't quite what anyone envisioned.    None of it matters anymore. The entire old world is gone. Any fight to protect Nuln, or the seiges against Altdorf... the cities are gone. None of the names of those who died on the fields of battle, nor those on the seas around Tilea matter, for all are perished. These lands have changed, and so their fate, ultimately, was to die. Anyone who stood to protect them, seize power, or change them were pointless. And I dislike that. Much like how in 40k, the Emperor is going to die, Chaos is going to breech the gate and invade Earth, the Tyranids are going to arrive in the Ultima Segmentum, the Orks are going to sweep through the Imperium... It's better when these events of massed apocalypse are forever impending disasters, just on the horizon. Once they've happened, they've... happened. Whatever is left, no matter how fresh and new is so different that it just pales in comparison to what we had before. It's not easy to care about an entirely new place when the one you loved before is so carelessly ripped from your hands. It's like you're on your Playstation, and someone walks in like ""Oh, are you enjoying yourself?"" before ripping the controller out of your hands with a sadistic grin and walking off with it while flipping you off, ""well fuck you."""
Warhammer,3cmqe6,Snood-Patrol,2,Thu Jul 16 22:12:28 2015 UTC,"I guess you could look at it as, well, that's life.  Sometimes it doesn't work out.   But I didn't get into Warhammer for a nihilistic treatise on the pointlessness of existence, as mentioned before the Warhammer universe was escapist fantasy not existential absurdism.  We want heroes and anti-heroes, villains and demigods and a world always on the brink of destruction.   Now they've blown that up.   So after End Times, no more novels?"
Warhammer,3cmqe6,Anomagnus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"There's already an AoS novel. According to the writer, it's about those gold sigmar dudes trying to find their way in the new world because nothing like them has existed before. So, new world, new guys... Only a handful of heroes survived the planet going up."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,LiquidAether,0,Fri Jul 17 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"Except every single one of those stories still exists, undiminished even for their supposed failure, they fought they died, and even when all is thought lost they managed to pull one over on the chaos gods, to let that one small light survive, to blaze into a resurgence of humanity into a beacon of hope.  Or you could continue to be a pessimist about it and completely disregard them, to diminish them with your decision to treat them as a failure, to say that they were all for nothing."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,pidgeon_pete,5,Fri Jul 10 10:54:53 2015 UTC,"They already existed in a shared universe. And let's not forget,  WFB, it just wasn't selling.  People are all pissed off, but what was GW gonna do?  High fantasy is done to death. There are a million alternatives if you want Knights and elves.  They could keep throwing good money after bad and hope something changes,  or they could try something different.   So I think this is the right move?  I don't know yet.  The game and lore is more interesting to me now, who knows how long that will last.  But I am glad they took a risk and tried something new"
Warhammer,3cmqe6,hylas,3,Thu Jul 9 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"It seems like there isn't actually much High Fantasy around these days, at least in wargaming.  All the top games, Warmahordes, Malifaux, Wrath of Kings, and so on seem to have taken pains to avoid high fantasy in exchange for having their own unique version.  The only wargame that matches that I can think of is Kings of War, which is basically just trying to be WFB."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,pidgeon_pete,3,Thu Jul 9 13:52:29 2015 UTC,I think 13% of total sales misses the fact that it was probably still the biggest Fantasy wargame on the market and that 13% was probably still a lot of money. They could have increased sales through more traditional means such as improving the product.
Warhammer,3cmqe6,S0noPritch,4,Thu Jul 9 10:13:10 2015 UTC,"13% may be a lot of sales in volume, but if there are single Space Marine chapters that make more than that, it is perhaps not the best use of your employees time to keep them working on sustaining and developing so many different armies. Your better off just adding a new Space Marines chapter (in this case, a fantasy themed one)."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,pidgeon_pete,3,Thu Jul 9 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"But they could have increased that 13% with only a few small changes. Improved rules, progressing the story in a less destructive ways. Even if AoS had been a skirmish variant of fantasy it would have made a huge difference as it would lower the cost of entry which was a huge problem."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,S0noPritch,3,Thu Jul 9 12:45:02 2015 UTC,It's still possible that they could release the 8th edition rules online in the future.  They claim to be listening to fan feedback more than ever.

Warhammer,3cmqe6,kde01,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:51:59 2015 UTC,"Everyone was basically at a stalemate. For one group to start winning other groups had to lose big. If the orcs would win it would mean the Empire was losing ground. Same with if Chaos won.   With Storm of Chaos the Chaos side was winning, IIRC, and would have taken a very important Empire city at the end. Since the campaign used player-submitted results and Chaos was so popular they were kicking ass. GW fiddled with the final result by having an orc warboss waltz out of the woods towards the Chaos commander of the siege on the empire, headbutt him, and then for some reason Chaos left. And the Orcs left. Since then GW has shown they don't want to adjust the lore out of fear of changing anything in the game."

Warhammer,3cmqe6,S0noPritch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:28:26 2015 UTC,I think I would have been more interested if they changed to more like the Lord of the rings style of gameplay rather than making fantasy more like 40k.

Warhammer,3cmqe6,kde01,2,Thu Jul 9 14:28:18 2015 UTC,I've often wondered why the turn order in WH/WH40K wasn't as you just described.  Do you remember if it worked well or not in LotR?
Warhammer,3cmqe6,DiscoHippo,2,Thu Jul 9 14:43:02 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for everyone but I really enjoyed it. I've always felt the more traditional wargame style to lead to less engrossing games as one player is almost left out of the game for extended periods of time.  My current game is Star Wars Armada, this uses the same system where there are phases and each player swaps during each phase meaning the game is very reactive to each action the players make. I personally prefer this due to the higher level of interactivity."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,pidgeon_pete,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"I think 13% of total sales misses the fact that it was probably still the biggest Fantasy wargame on the market and that 13% was probably still a lot of money   Might not have been enough money to make keeping it around financially viable. For all we know it could have raked in, say, 5 M per year but cost them 8 M per year. If they thought they could refocus some of their assets to better support 40k, their cash cow, while creating a new game that's more in line with where the industry is using whatever is left of the existing assets that might have seemed a much better idea. Possibly they were stretching their mould-makers and designers thin and instead of hiring new ones they just moved over some of the team and kept the best working on Age of Sigmar."

Warhammer,3cmqe6,pidgeon_pete,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:55:05 2015 UTC,Genuinely I think the price on the miniatures wasn't that bad but the cost of all the extra gubbins is a big put off for new players and unlike 40k you can't play fantasy at smaller levels (well you could but it sucked at small skirmish levels).

With zero up front buy-in (free, simple rules) and the more interesting rules attached to the warscrolls themselves rather than being game-wide. It kind of reminds me of the business model of games like League of Legends, where they get you in the door and then sell you characters piecemeal, and each one plays in a drastically different way."
Warhammer,3cmqe6,mrscienceguy1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:19:26 2015 UTC,Honestly I wouldn't hate AoS if not for the fact that it is a bad replacement for Fantasy. As a cheap alternative yeah its fine but I hate them for gutting an amazing game.

Warhammer,3cmqe6,GreyGriffin_h,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:06:01 2015 UTC,I like the idea that Fantasy/Age of Sigmar is the warp reflection of what's happening in 40K and is pretty much right at the start of the Great Crusade.  An Emperor arises on a world filled with things that are largely reflections of the mythology of the real world. Eventually the world explodes with violence and the former occupants are spread out to a huge number of disparate worlds. With the help of a Dragon the emperor finds them they enter a golden age of prosperity until Chaos really blows up and he's forced to withdraw to the seat of his power. The realms spend an age in the grip of Chaos before the emperor and his reforged warriors launch a campaign to reclaim the various worlds from the grip of chaos.

However even though they are standalone they are supposed to mesh and work in tandem.   So I'm sure over all three games they release and the inevitable Creative assembly DLC all the races will be expressed and playable."

Warhammer,3ckg13,mancub92,2,Thu Jul 9 09:20:37 2015 UTC,I wonder if it will be anything like Dawn of War. Individual campaigns as the expansions come out but the core of it just had additions.

Warhammer,3ckg13,Zentdiam,9,Wed Jul 8 17:49:42 2015 UTC,The reaction among the non-players at the office is that they're more interested in getting into the miniature game now because there is a lower barrier of entry :)
Warhammer,3ckg13,ShallowBasketcase,6,Wed Jul 8 18:28:48 2015 UTC,I think it also appeals to 40k players. They want to sell models and even with the internet community going ape shit I think they're going to sell a TON of models.
Warhammer,3ckg13,ohgoddontdoit,0,Wed Jul 8 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, the rules are still scary to look at and there is still a bunch of modifiers.  The cost and time to commit to gaming (another cost, time is money), the real barriers, didn't change.    The rule books they could have just released all the old rules for free as well and spent time just strictly making the game better, not newer.  The idea that complicated rules is the problem I think is BS.  If the rules were on a great video game platform, no one would flinch at wheeling or moving blocks of troops.    Even then, people love moving ships in X-wing and Star Wars Armada and I find that just as stiff, the difference is Fantasy Flight added far more aides for movement, updating TT movement instead of dumbing it down."

Warhammer,3cmxxf,aythrea,2,Thu Jul 9 03:53:33 2015 UTC,Looks pretty good to me. Your paints look pretty smooth.  The only thing to be a bit careful of is that when you paint over where glue is going to go it doesn't work too well. It looks like you did that here and there.   What if you tried silver for the main colour and used red / gold for the trims? Could work maybe?   You should upload them when they're done!
Warhammer,3cmxxf,Walkemb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:28:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! Much appreciated.  About the paint and glue areas, I end up sanding those areas back down to bare plastic so when I glue I get a good tight connection.

Warhammer,3cmxxf,Snood-Patrol,2,Thu Jul 9 12:48:39 2015 UTC,"I suggest you switch up the red and gold you are using, as they are neither works with the other too well, and I'd darken either the silver or red to up the contrast along the lines of the chipping.  Atm, the models just look dull, which is a shame because the actual effect you're experimenting with looks awesome.  So, yeah, darken the red, drop the gold for a different spot colour, and then once you've a wash or whatever you are thinking for the high/low lights and you'll have an awesome looking army. :)"

Warhammer,3clr04,ifckduphelp,13,Wed Jul 8 22:04:57 2015 UTC,most boards you see people playing on are 4'x'6'
Warhammer,3clr04,Frenchit,7,Wed Jul 8 22:11:00 2015 UTC,"My friend built his out of MDF board, they sold it as an 8x4 piece, and cut it for free to two seperate 3x4 pieces.  He then used some 2x4's and a saw to build supports in a sort of X pattern under each piece, and then made a frame around the outsides to gives them a lip which he nailed into the under frame pieces.  The two pieces are easy to move and can be put up on a table after putting down some cardboard to protect from scratching from the wood.  Now its like a nice lip so dice and things dont roll off as much, and its a very solid 6x4 table top to play on and put away.  We plan to buy a gaming mat, but I've done the foam before.  If you want to go with the foam get the pink insulation foam sheets they sell for cheap at the hardware store, grab like 2 of the big sheets.  Then you want to go to an arts and craft store and buy a hot wire cutter.  You can cut the pieces using a band saw or something sharp if you are careful into nice 2x2 tiles, which you can put on your table.  With the hot wire cutter you can easily shape and cut at the foam to make some areas thinner for low lands, and other areas not cut for hill tops etc.  Then you need to spackle it as spray paint will cause it to melt.  Then you can prime and paint it and add details.  Alternately if you have an air brush you can paint it with other paints without melting it."
Warhammer,3clr04,zaszz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:34:19 2015 UTC,"Since so many have told me to use MDF board, I'll probably use that instead of plywood. I've considered mats, but they cost 70 euros + 25% taxes and shipping. It makes them very expensive."

Warhammer,3clr04,ChicagoCowboy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:50:26 2015 UTC,"The reason its warped is because the MDF absorbed the moisture from the PVA glue.

The rigid foam some people use is called extruded polystyrene. It's the same thing as insulation foam. You can carve it with a sharp knife or a hot wire foam cutter for better, smoother cuts and easy sculpting. If you go down this route you'll want to grab some water-soluble all purpose filler to help smooth things out. Also grab some sand (and flock if that's your thing) to texture the surface with."

Warhammer,3cmdd4,Triplin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"First, some of these things don't seem to have the names that I generally associate with them. I am assuming, for example, that a ""Heavy Missile"" is a missile launcher.  How to save points: -Get rid of all the vet sargents -Don't take powerfists on the sargents -I don't understand why you would take a single land speeder. -If the heavy bolter is twinlinked then you don't need venerable status. -Drop the power fist in the sterns. Just use them for shooting.  I don't like mixed combi weapons in sterns and the more you have the less you use special (read: expensive) ammo.  Also, do your sterns have drop pods?"
Warhammer,3cmdd4,apalehorse,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yes when I put Heavy Missile I meant Missile Launcher as I was pulling the weapon from the Heavy List.  Why shouldn't I have vet seargents / Powerfists?  Could you please explain why a land speeder is bad? and maybe what to use instead?  No Drop pods for sterns, was going to use them in front of the Dreadnaughts as a shield.  Thanks for your other advice."
Warhammer,3cmdd4,apalehorse,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:01:24 2015 UTC,"Hold on, you're putting sternguard in front of dreads to be a meat shield? That's a really expensive strategy.   The way that you have your army set up, you don't want your troops in close combat. You're taking heavy weapons that can't fire and charge, so if you want to charge, you can't use those expensive heavy weapons.  If you want to have troop units that can assault with the PF, you need to take assault weapons, not the least of which because you need to be able to soften them up before CC since Tacs are ok in CC but not a dedicated CC unit.  That still won't solve the challenge problem that you'll face.  A vet with a PF is a lot of points and, in my opinion, too much to pay for the possibility of popping a vehicle up close (i'd rather just do it with a cheaper meltagun).  Vets and power weapons are just the best way to cut points."

Warhammer,3clxxr,Zombito13,10,Thu Jul 9 00:27:52 2015 UTC,Lots of people are moving to kings of war by Mantic.
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,8,Thu Jul 9 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"Looks just like Fantasy, what is the difference? I read some stuff but I was wondering from just another person point of view."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Zombito13,15,Thu Jul 9 02:51:43 2015 UTC,"Better rules. Cheaper rules, cheaper models, not broken magic, player council advises them, Mantic actually gives a shit about players."
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,14,Thu Jul 9 03:09:06 2015 UTC,"You had me at cheaper models to be honest. Also it can't be overstated that if you already have an army in WFB you can absolutely use them in kings of war. It's litterally free for most players, still being supported, and for those that don't have an army, has a cheaper entry point. And to add on to the notion that mantic gives a shit about its players I'd recommend actually buying their rules and stuff. Give your money to a company that deserves it."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Harukiller14,8,Thu Jul 9 03:16:19 2015 UTC,"Yep! The 2.0 rules come out Friday for free, but I ordered the rulebook and plan to start a Mantic army of orcs and gobbies."
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,3,Thu Jul 9 03:28:40 2015 UTC,Id say unless you're doing some official tourny you can use them for either.

Its kind of like pokemon and digimon. I can admit digimon is cool, but i would never watch it or get their cards. There is something pokemon just gets right."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Fujum8,4,Thu Jul 9 09:53:09 2015 UTC,"I felt that way too, and I think it's because GW just has a very classic look to their models and it's just nice to look at on all fronts, but for me to price for those models is too high for what I get out of them. The mantic models are a step down quality wise, but not by much honestly."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Harukiller14,3,Thu Jul 9 12:21:22 2015 UTC,"Dunno, I'd say the quality drops by quite a lot. Compared to GW plastics, even Finecast, 'restic' is an utter ballache to assemble and never looks anywhere near as good as the (resin master moulded) minis on the box and the website."
Warhammer,3clxxr,nevaks,-2,Thu Jul 9 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"Arguable as to whether that deserve it. They always seem short staffed and are always advertising for people to fill central roles, which implies that people are quitting at a fair rate, which is never the sign of a well run company. The fact that they just seem to want to do everything workshop does, the low quality of their miniatures and the rapid release of a lot of different gaming systems makes them just come across as a cheap company trying to make a quick buck. Wasn't Ronnie fired from the design studio? Feels less like a business more like an exercise in proving a point."
Warhammer,3clxxr,nevaks,-2,Thu Jul 9 12:49:36 2015 UTC,"makes them just come across as a cheap company trying to make a quick buck.   Feels less like a business more like an exercise in proving a point.    I get both of those feelings, and I barely know their story. Just from what people at my local gaming store told me.   The claims that their rules are better are, apparently, very opinion-based. I spoke with people that hated the game. Kings of War is only in the store in a very small section because it never, ever sells but there are a few fanatics who come in weeks to buy more. They never play at the store, though, only at their homes.  Can't say I'd want to be seen outside with those models either."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,2,Thu Jul 9 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah...  A small number of fanatical fans is probably right. I've played KoW, and...  it's fine? Totally targeted at the tournament crowd, so I can see why some people are going that way if AoS isn't for them."
Warhammer,3clxxr,nevaks,0,Thu Jul 9 15:10:51 2015 UTC,It's good to have the opinion of someone that's actually played it. It really seems that everyone talking about KoW in here has never played it. I actually had someone tell me in another comment that KoW is better than AoS because AoS is not actually a game of fantasy battles. What? How is that a valid reason?  Let us know what your thoughts on KoW are if you can. And possibly compare them to WFB and AoS? I think people in this sub should know what they're getting into before they dump a few hundred bucks into shitty Mantic minis because someone on the internet made it seem like KoW is exactly like WFB but 10000x better.
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,4,Thu Jul 9 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"You don't have to buy Mantic's minis or even rebase your guys before you try out KoW2.0.  You download the new rules tomorrow, print them out, and try it. Print 'em at work. $0.00 cost. Use your existing WHFB models.  KoW2.0 probably isn't 1000x better than WHFB8th - but it is alive and you can actually get people into the game. As of a couple weeks ago, you can't even buy the WHFB8th edition rules anymore."
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"So, it's basically a simplified version of Warhammer, with a few tweaks. It's been a while since I played a game of it, but the biggest difference, imo, is that units don't deplete and are bought in fixed blocks. So, my army list contains a block of either ten, twenty or thirty spearmen, for example. During the game you don't remove models - instead, you stack up damage tokens on the unit, with more tokens meaning the whole unit is more likely to run away / be scattered. This means you get people sticking their models down directly on the movement trays, as you never need to remove them. Units also have a fixed frontage, far as I remember, but that might not be right.   For me, this was always weird. Units were at full fighting strength for the whole game, then they just popped. Strange!   One other difference is that only the player whose turn it is rolls dice - it's intentional so you can use a chess timer and your opponent can't run your timer down.  I mean...  Don't get me wrong, it's  not a bad game. It's just very much targeted entirely towards tournament play. There's a bit of an issue in that the balance isn't great in a lot of places (something that doesn't bother me in Warhammer because that's more about narrative and cool stories), but that might be fixed in v2, I dunno.   I know Beasts of War did a playthrough video a while ago. Might be worth looking up!"
Warhammer,3clxxr,nevaks,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"You had me at cheaper models to be honest.   They're absolutely terrible, though. I looked at getting some this past weekend to start a small AoS army on the cheap (I know the army comp will change and units will disappear from AoS so I don't want to make any purchases yet) and didn't see anything at all appealing."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,5,Thu Jul 9 13:52:02 2015 UTC,"Well that's pretty subjective. I think they look pretty cool. GW minis look more refined, but that should be expected when you're around for 30 years. Mantic miniatures are great for the price and they'll only get better the more people invest in it."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Harukiller14,0,Thu Jul 9 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"I think they could have already been fantastic models if the company felt like it. The difference in price of a mould, as far as I know, is very small when you add more detail. A highly detailed mould doesn't cost more, but the plastic used in it needs to be higher quality and stronger.  Mantic uses cheap plastic of quite low quality and thus don't have detailed moulds. Their whole idea is to be as cheap as they can be, hence the ugliness of the models. I don't think their quality will ever reach GW levels because I think they're not interested in quality but quantity."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,6,Thu Jul 9 15:57:56 2015 UTC,Thats not necessarily a bad thing.  Not everyone wants to pay $55 for 10 models just because someone decided to put little super-detailed skulls all over them.
Warhammer,3clxxr,AdmiralCrackbar,-2,Thu Jul 9 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"That's oversimplifying things. Compare the Vampire Count skeletons to Mantic's. Compare the Dwarf Warriors to Mantic's. GW's models shit all over Mantic's visually and, from what I've been reading today, in quality too.   It's not just super-detailed skulls."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,6,Thu Jul 9 16:29:50 2015 UTC,I dont like the designs of KoW :(

Warhammer,3clxxr,saxonturner,-1,Thu Jul 9 06:19:10 2015 UTC,With GW you get better quality models and much better looking models. The Mantic stuff is shit.  GW's stuff is still over priced but if I had to choose between the two I'd still go GW. I wouldn't want an army I hate looking at. Those models are absolutely terrible. Michael J Fox could sculpt better.
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:56:43 2015 UTC,"I noticed that, there's not many close up pictures of the models either which is a warning sign of quality, price is a really bummer for me with GW stuff, I would love to have other army's but it's just too expensive when I have other things I need to spend my money on."
Warhammer,3clxxr,saxonturner,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:40:11 2015 UTC,Tbf the minis on the website / box covers are made of a much higher quality material than the actual minis... So a close up wouldn't help anyway.
Warhammer,3clxxr,nevaks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"I would love to have other army's but it's just too expensive when I have other things I need to spend my money on.   There's always another hobby. I've gone through a half dozen of them since I stopped playing Warhammer as many years back and they've all been expensive. Much more so than Warhammer. So the prices of GW models don't faze me much and I've learned to be very deliberate with what I purchase.  It's a good idea to spread your wings and look into other hobbies, IMO. Keep the stuff you have but put your money elsewhere."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,3,Thu Jul 9 15:59:41 2015 UTC,cheaper rules is kind of a moot point now that fantasy has free rules.
Warhammer,3clxxr,psykolog,3,Thu Jul 9 06:52:12 2015 UTC,"Except fantasy doesn't have free rules. AoS has free rules. If you want to play 8th and don't have a book you're shit outta luck, unless I'm horribly mistaken?"
Warhammer,3clxxr,Tigerbones,3,Thu Jul 9 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Cheaper mass battle rules 😆
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:10:31 2015 UTC,"Those are appealing things for some people - and I certainly wish GW's models were cheaper, but man are a lot of those Mantic models seriously ugly.   BUT people play for different reasons - I like painting and building the coolest looking models, some people could play with balls of lent and a stat sheet.   I'll try out AoS and see where it takes me. Been playing Warhammer on and off since like 98 so might as well see it through.  If it sucks though I'll likely be checking out other rule systems and games for sure :-/"
Warhammer,3clxxr,Ealdwulf1066,2,Thu Jul 9 16:04:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean they do make some not appealing models (they're still in their infancy re: model making) but fantasy models are available almost anywhere from tons of different companies.   I'm glad you're open to different stuff. Many GW gamers aren't and I actually kinda pity them for wanting to polish the poop that AoS is.
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,2,Thu Jul 9 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yea - I'm definitely open to different stuff!   I honestly don't care if it's GW or Privateer Press, or whoever!  If the models are cool and the rules are fun (and hopefully a setting I enjoy) I'm all in!   So far Warhammer and 40k are just the settings that appeal to me the most, or rather the models and settings are really well fleshed out.  However I really enjoyed what little warmahordes I played. I have a small Trollkin army.   I think people are close minded too often in this hobby. I play ""X"" therefor ""Y"" is terrible! I realize a lot of people are upset about Age of Sigmar - I have a lot invested in Warhammer fantasy too, but I just want to be tempered about it and give it time before I declare it's doomed."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Ealdwulf1066,2,Thu Jul 9 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"That's a good PoV to have. Too many people are glancing at the rules and reading angry posts online and deciding AoS isn't worth a second look. For me it actually is fun to play, if a little chaotic, and many in my local scene are enjoying it. It definitely needs to grow, no doubt about that, but for someone coming back from a few years out of tabletop gaming it's cool. It's actually the first game that made me want to get back into things.   While I do think Warmahordes has better rules than either Warhammer game the lore of the Warhammer worlds is better IMO. I also think Flames of War has (or had, back when I went from GW games to flames I war - I don't know where things stand now) better rules, but that's just WWII. The epic fantasy crafted for the Warhammer world is really cool, and I hope they keep that going for AoS."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in the same boat kde01.   I still collected on and off the last 3 years, but I haven't played a game of 8th in a looong time.   Age of Sigmar actually got me excited - I realize it does need room to grow and has some growing pains for sure. Ultimately, it might be a failure, but a lot of guys up at my store are playing and really enjoying it.   I think just like any game, given time, the kinks will get worked out. And hopefully GW leaves us with something worth the journey."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Ealdwulf1066,2,Thu Jul 9 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"GW is great at making the spirit of a game great, and good at making rules. If they can keep the rules simple and build off (what I feel is) a good base then I think they'll have a winner on their hands. I don't ever think AoS will reach as wide an audience as 40k but I do think it'll be successful.   It really has me excited too. I see the promise in it and in my area, like yours, people are really enjoying it. I came here to this sub to talk about it and all I see are posts raging about how bad it is, how the rules suck, how GW hates everyone, how KoW is the second coming of Christ, and how AoS isn't worth a second look. Which is unfortunate and unfair as most of these people, when pressed, will end up admitting they haven't even played it. A lot of people are forming opinions when they haven't played or watched it played, which is unfair, and are putting so much focus on the lack of points and regiments that it's becoming tiresome.   Yes, GW did away with regiments and points. GW did away with WFB. This isn't WFB, but a new game. If you compare it to WFB and are looking for regiments and points systems it'll always fall short because that's not the point of the game. People need to keep a more open mind and just play a few games. If they're here chances are they already have the models.  I don't have any left. I'll have to go out and buy a whole new army. Might hit up ebay and get a few units of Skaven or Wood Elves to try the new rules out more. I like that the game is quick and fun, while deep if you want it to be. Kings of War games seem to be very, very similar to WFB with some quirks. I don't want to play 3 hour long games with rigid rules, I want a max hour long game with flexibility and fun. I don't care if I lose. If my opponent puts out a force that really dwarfs mine with double the warscrolls then fuck it, I'll go balls out for my sudden death victory and have fun doing it."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,5,Thu Jul 9 19:10:31 2015 UTC,"We are going to have to wait and see for this I think. I have heard KOW thrown out a bunch of times, but we don't know if it will actually take off. The main problem with WFB isn't actually the rules, it is that it is hard to find gamers to play against. (the rules do need work)   Right now I bet it is more likely that players will simply mod 8.5 WFB, but this isn't really sustainable long term, especially if GW starts removing its kits from that website.   A lot of people dislike Mantic as an inferior clone product (I have no opinion on it). However, regardless Mantic should be thanking GW for this golden opportunity. Releasing their rules free is a great move. It will be interesting to see what happens."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Marbodoesntforgive,2,Thu Jul 9 08:12:47 2015 UTC,"The main benefit for KoW from what I have seen, is that they more or less promised to release free army lists to use any/all Fantasy armies in their system. So its essentially a free way to continue to use your GW models in an infantry block style military game with a community that actually has a decent foothold, so games will be easier to come by.  From what I understand though the rules for KoW are just as dividing as the rules for 8th. My community of roughly 12-15 wargamers loved 8th edition - the one qualm being the dreaded ""6"" magic spells, but otherwise the game was balanced and played well regardless of the armies players used.   There are people I know who absolutely hate KoW as much as other people love it, just depends on what you're looking for in a wargame as always."
Warhammer,3clxxr,ChicagoCowboy,2,Thu Jul 9 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"The main problem with WFB isn't actually the rules, it is that it is hard to find gamers to play against   This is area (""meta"") specific. Many areas have plenty of eager Fantasy players. But you are right in that there are also areas where it's tough to find another player.   However, regardless Mantic should be thanking GW for this golden opportunity. Releasing their rules free is a great move.   I agree it's great publicity for them, but how are they making any money? Rules are free and players have their armies already. And if they need some models, they are buying the GW products (either from (web)stores or eBay). Everyone is patting Mantic's head, but no one is giving them any money, except for those who want to buy the hardcover rulebook."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Capraviridae,2,Thu Jul 9 10:30:38 2015 UTC,"I know there are hold outs, but we can all agree money hungry GW killed the game because it wasn't making enough cash. This is a lot to do with this policies verse the actually quality of the game at least in my opinion.   As for Mantic, if they are able to sink their claws into people and the game becomes popular they are going to see an explosion of business. The rules are free so now people are playing their game so new players are going to start showing up buying from mantic not GW. Eventually they are going to need more models and Mantic will be the only game in town.   If you look at games like Epic Armageddon another game GW abandoned that basically happened. People fan made the rules into a tight system. You can ebay the GW models for an arm or a leg or the other option which is provided sites people can go to buy models from other companies to proxy."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Marbodoesntforgive,0,Thu Jul 9 11:32:15 2015 UTC,"money hungry GW killed the game because it wasn't making enough cash   God forbid a publicly-traded company does what it needs to do - make money.

The rules are free so now people are playing their game so new players are going to start showing up buying from mantic not GW. Eventually they are going to need more models and Mantic will be the only game in town.   Mantic has apparently had a foothold in my area for a while, but it's only a few guys and they never play in the local store. They come in and buy models and leave. AoS actually kicked up a massive positive reaction. Then again most people in my area play Warmahordes, 40k, and Infinity anyway so I guess AoS is an easy jump. Kings of War was never even mentioned. I think people just figured they'll play with 8th ed rules for the time being."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,3,Thu Jul 9 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"No one is saying GW shouldn't make money. WFB wasn't making enough cash because of GW crappy policies. Instead of doing something different they have tried to press forward with their we are the best at everything all or model kits are collector items people should buy every set idea.   ""Screw our customers we only care about people new people would are spending money in the store NOW"" is moronic. It kills your brand. Not only will Veterans leave, but new players will be like ""gee everyone talks bad about GW why should I spend all my money"".   If they supported their games better, took community feedback, supported the free advertising local stores/ tournes give things would be different. They could have their cake and eat it. Privateer Presses stuff is just as expensive and it took WFB's number 2 spot by doing just that. X-Wing did the same thing when it pushed past Warmachine.    AoS is probably going to sell well from models alone. However, that only goes so far. If the game isn't great no one is going to keep throwing down money for furture releases enough to dethrone Infinity or Malifaux or any of the other dozens of skirmish games. It remains to be seen if AoS is going to be a dud or a success. Right now it is looking like a dud. Outside of the models the online reaction has been negative. There are some neat sounding ideas in the rumors, but not many have faith that GW is going to pull it off.   As for Mantic, they now have the only WFB replacement that exists. WFB wasn't on top, but lots of people played it. They all complained about the same thing, bad rules and poor model support, which supposedly KOW has addressed.

Warhammer,3clxxr,Marbodoesntforgive,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"No one is saying GW shouldn't make money. WFB wasn't making enough cash because of GW crappy policies. Instead of doing something different they have tried to press forward with their we are the best at everything all or model kits are collector items people should buy every set idea.   When they tried to do something different before people freaked out (Storm of Chaos and the lore/map actually changing). I think they're scarred from attempts like that. People don't like change. They say they do, but they don't. Everyone wanted the WFB to be more simple and the game to be more dynamic and when it happened with AoS everyone collectively shat themselves.   Their models are fantastic, much better than most of their competitors. I don't think they actually expect everyone to buy every model out there at all I think it's more about making models that are appealing for the widest possible group. It'd be stupid not to.  This is a very niche market. There aren't many people that buy toy soldiers, paint them, and then play war on a table with them. That's weird to most people. The market is small and isn't growing very much so GW needs to try and appeal to as many tabletop gamers as possible with each new release.    ""Screw our customers we only care about people new people would are spending money in the store NOW"" is moronic. It kills your brand. Not only will Veterans leave, but new players will be like ""gee everyone talks bad about GW why should I spend all my money"".   How are they screwing their customers? I've seen this argument for years and never understood it. GW may make some stupid decisions but I've never thought they've been trying to screw over their customers in favor of new people. I'd like some examples if you can think of any.   If they supported their games better, took community feedback, supported the free advertising local stores/ tournes give things would be different. They could have their cake and eat it. Privateer Presses stuff is just as expensive and it took WFB's number 2 spot by doing just that. X-Wing did the same thing when it pushed past Warmachine.   I think their games are supported fairly well. I do remember the days that GW had an employee that would travel to local gaming stores for tournaments and Warhammer days to act as the company's liaison, help with rules disputes, and run painting clinics. That was cool. But that's absolutely unsustainable. Very, very few of them actually earned their paycheck.   Free advertising in local stores and during tournaments would be great. Local tournaments ran by GW would also be great. The loss of the regional Gamesday is unfortunate but GW could just run tourneys out of local gaming store. Tournaments in actual stores are very profitable.   Community feedback is difficult. At least for GW. There are many customers that are so entrenched in the old way that they scream and cry about how the old way was best and what's happening now is shit, whether it's actually shit or not. Warmahordes and X-Wing seem to have a much more rational fanbase while GWs seems to very prone to complaining. Maybe it's the average age of the player, I don't know.    AoS is probably going to sell well from models alone. However, that only goes so far. If the game isn't great no one is going to keep throwing down money for furture releases enough to dethrone Infinity or Malifaux or any of the other dozens of skirmish games. It remains to be seen if AoS is going to be a dud or a success. Right now it is looking like a dud. Outside of the models the online reaction has been negative. There are some neat sounding ideas in the rumors, but not many have faith that GW is going to pull it off.   They may not. Or it may be a runaway hit and kill those other games. Who knows. What we do know is that GW will be slimming down their line and trimming down their rules. They're trimming the fat. They're probably going to get rid of half their moulds and focus on a smaller set of models. That right there is already a massive cost savings.   With AoS they're probably going more towards creating a wholly GW owned IP that has great potential for telling a lot of stories (books, games would be great in the new universe - it's easy to destroy worlds if you can move between them versus only having one world that has, apparently, several dozen people that can just fuck everything up whenever they feel like it) over time as well as advancing the storyline without destroying what already exists. While opening up so many creative doors they're also embarking on a massive cost savings campaign to make the fantasy side of GW profitable again. Reducing the amount of moulds and, accompanying that, probably the amount of designers and sculptors as well. Surely the cost savings will be huge. It also frees up resources for 40k without having to hire new people. The switch to AoS makes the fantasy side of GW much more lean which, I think, was their goal from the start. Trim the fat and maximize profits. Margins are already great so surely their expenditures were way too high.   As for Mantic, they now have the only WFB replacement that exists. WFB wasn't on top, but lots of people played it. They all complained about the same thing, bad rules and poor model support, which supposedly KOW has addressed. Those Vets might be interested in changing over. That is a gold mine. However, it could fall to nothing. It just remains to be seen what happens.    If you think GW had poor model support good luck with Mantic. Their models are shit and super low quality. Those vets should go ahead and change over IMO - KoW is a game that's less about having fun and more about a rigid rules set and tournament style play. That's good for them, that's obviously not what AoS is about. Another user here told me they found the rules 'okay' and that it was tournament-focused so I started doing some research and found info echoing the same as what he said. If I ever felt the desire to go to a tabletop gaming tournament I could play KoW for that. But, honestly, the lack of players would make that...boring. Sure there may be more, but not in my area. And I'm not about to go on a road trip for a tabletop game. If anything I'd play Warmahordes for tournament play. It's much, much more popular and the models are infinitely better quality-wise and visually.  EDIT: Just because you disagree doesn't mean you should downvote. This is a warhammer board, discussions about AoS are relevant."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:26:45 2015 UTC,"People aren’t afraid of change if it is solid and well thought out. GW has lost their customers trust because that do idiotic stuff. Storm of Chaos was a debacle because they worked themselves into a corner and didn’t think of a way out. Then they magic wanded the whole thing because they screwed up so bad. Cry me a river if they don’t do anything because they are afraid. The whole problem is GW does not engage their player base at all. They sit their silent acting like their decisions are perfect every time. This is exactly the issue with AoS. How would you or anyone else know if “everyone wanted WFB to be more simple or the game to be more dynamic”? GW sure doesn’t because they didn’t bother to ask.   They literally do want you to buy every model. That is their whole business plan. They are billing themselves as a collector’s item company in an effort to make sales. They use terminology like hobbist instead of wargamer because to them the game is secondary. They want this stuff to be valued so high that you will buy it at any price. This is how they can sell individual models like Kurt Helborg for 40$ because he is a special limited character. The market is pretty big and has been getting bigger for years. The problem for GW is let competition appear they have squandered the advantage they have had built for so long.  As for screwing new customers this goes right back to their current silence policy. In that past plenty of games have just out right disappeared with little notice. Support just stopped. Age of Sigmar at least had this them saying Warhammer is done as you know it. However, the whole internet was going nuts for months asking if their game is dying. GW just let the riots happen and is now like WFB is still here you can play with your models. Meanwhile AoS to WFB is basically like chess to checkers. There was nothing stopping them from throwing by adding a rules update for 8.5 fantasy and saying here you can still play WFB, but also here is rules for AoS:WFB. Instead, they killed most of their veteran player base. WFB is as of right now dead. Including that glotkin you bought last year and that super expensive End Times set that there is a good chance they are no longer supporting long term.   However, it goes farther than that. They have actively squashed gaming and commerce outside of GW stores. They have tried to crush the local game stores that supported the game for years. Saying the games are supported is completely inaccurate. If you read father up one of the guys mention that Mantic has a council of players who help advise on the game. Privateer press has press gangers; Warlord has their own guys. They just play the game for fun and help bring people into the hobby. They know the game inside and out and try to teach people. These are really the guys who sell you hobby and they cost next to nothing.  Saying community feedback is difficult is BS. Nearly every other wargaming company does it. It has nothing to do with the GW players. Sure there may be a lot of morons on Dakka, but those guys were manufactured by GW. GW has routinely put out shitty rules that make no sense. They make models that are no selling well OP to sell more. They downplay or remove ones to sell new kits. Their new favorite tactic is to use stupid game breaking formations to sell pay to win content, instead of smartly using them as hot patches to codex mistakes.   Meanwhile, ask any of the pros and they could tell you in five mins what is wrong with the game. Take a look at this link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo1PkXrMiPk  You only need to watch two mins of the video to get what is going on. The best players for WFB in the US are talking about the US invite only masters tournament. If you go through the series you see it’s a bunch of guys who know the game in and out, what works and what doesn’t work. Units that are crap or great etc etc. There are groups like this all over the world. Why didn’t they ask them? If GW supported the hobby, it literally would not cost them anything. Why don’t they go have the guy who works the store in Springfield VA, drive down to Nova Open and help advise. Or to ETC in Europe. Those events happen on their own, the overhead for paying a single employee to help support their hobby for solid advertising among their best customers is literally worth more than a years supply of white dwarf issues for every person.    I would go far to say that most players even the ones that have stopped playing want to see GW succeed and do well. I still like 40k with all its faults. I was throwing together a WFB army before Jan happened. However, you can’t deny the writing on the wall. GW is a terribly run company. When their own CEO literally says “we don’t need to talk to our player base” in his we letter to the shareholders after their stocks took a nose dive you know something is wrong.   This is why there is this discussion about AoS. You are attacking Mantic, but I really don’t care about them. I am just pointing out they could really take the ball GW has spiked and run with it. They have a large scale formation game that as far as I know is different. They will succeed or fail on their own merits. GW on the other hand has made a skirmish game in a market already flooded with skirmish games. I doubt I will put any money in this until it matures. Most of the players here are in the same boat."
Warhammer,3clxxr,Marbodoesntforgive,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of good points. GW has often painted themselves into a corner, lore-wise (they've done so in 40k, too) and they don't listen to players. They have been breaking rules over and over again, ever since I started 15 years ago. They're not a very well run company. I don't deny any of that. It really isn't opinion, it's basically fact for anyone that's been paying attention to what's going on.  Now I knew these were issues, but I didn't know how bad they've gotten. I haven't been involved in GW stuff for several years. I got into Flames of War and dabbled in Warmahordes for a bit. I really wish Privateer Press had the solid story foundation that WFB does, i'd definitely be more willing to jump in.  The lack of support is crazy. I mentioned in another comment how i remember the days GW had outriders, or whatever they called them - people whose job it was to travel to various local gaming stores to promote GW products by holding tournaments, painting clinics, etc. I wish they still did that, but I can understand why they don't (that's a lot of money to spend that you wouldn't see immediate returns on).   I don't know what the situation is inside GW but I do know what I've seen at my local store. Small skirmish battle games like Warmahordes dominate in my area and AoS fits right in. That's why I said it seemed like they were listening - maybe not to their hardcore Fantasy fans, which is unfortunate, but to the market at a whole. They're trying to take their IP and make it more palatable to a wider audience and I can't really fault them for it.  I don't know why anyone would downvote your comment (or mine above) as they are on point. GW has fucked up plenty in the past. Maybe because I have been away from the hobby for years I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt but others aren't. Who knows. Anyway, you're back up to 1. Hope people in here can stop the downvote parade whenever someone says anything against KoW. This is turning from /r/warhammer to /r/KoWcirclejerk pretty quickly. Their fans are like jehovahs witnesses in every AoS discussion."
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,6,Thu Jul 9 23:31:04 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand why this is. Why not stick with 8th? Kings of War existed before, so why move now?"
Warhammer,3clxxr,The_Carthaginian,12,Thu Jul 9 05:09:13 2015 UTC,It's supported. While it's supported it will grow. A growing community is a healthy one. A healthy community makes games easier to find. No wonder fantasy died. GW killed it by not supporting the community.
Warhammer,3clxxr,FoUfCfK,4,Thu Jul 9 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"I always wondered about the part GW played in fantasy dying. The way I saw it, whenever they DID do a fantasy release there was much fanfare and excitement...but when you only release 2 fantasy books a year (if at all), and 10 40k books, then throw your hands up and go ""Wow I can't believe Fantasy isn't selling!!!""...on some level you have to take ownership of that; its not an apples to apples comparison.  Back in 2014, we had Dwarfs, Wood Elves, End Times I-V. A total of what..10 weeks of fantasy releases? Okay so 10/52 weekly releases = 19% of releases. And Fantasy is what % of sales for GW? Oh that's right, anywhere from 18-21% based on their annual figures...hmmmm what a coincidence?"
Warhammer,3clxxr,ChicagoCowboy,2,Thu Jul 9 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good point. It makes sense that GW wants to support their cash cow but to neglect Fantasy was stupid. I remember when things were on a different schedule - Fantasy and 40k would see updates every other month. One month we'd have a WFB release, then 40k, then WFB, etc. That was one way to do it, but I guess when GW saw fantasy sales dropping they stopped that release schedule.   IMO there should be no reason big releases can't happen in the same month. Just release things when they're ready. Make a dedicated AoS team and a dedicated 40k team and roll things out whenever they complete, not every other month in the first week or whatever."

Warhammer,3clxxr,gribblewielder,2,Thu Jul 9 10:44:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I imagine some players will just dump all their shit on eBay or just let it gather dust on a shelf after trying KoW and deciding 'it isn't Warhammer' and that's a shame.
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,0,Thu Jul 9 12:09:09 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how using a ruleset that is probably good and better than AoS   So you don't know the KoW rules yet to say for sure then? Why make this statement?  I'm not doubting you at all tbf. A system that's been out for years having better rules than another system that's been out less than a week is hardly surprising. I'm sure AoS will progress and improve as time goes on. It's a brand new system. Give it time.
Warhammer,3clxxr,kde01,2,Thu Jul 9 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I know it is good. I know it is better than AoS because AoS is not 'game of fantasy battles'.  I realize that AoS could be good in the far future, but I don't give GW that benefit of the doubt."
Warhammer,3clxxr,mugginns,0,Thu Jul 9 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"That's not very convincing logic there. That's just you thinking AoS isn't a game of fantasy battles, when it is, and making a massive, massive jump from that to saying KoW is better than AoS. What happens when you finally come to terms that AoS IS, in fact, a game of fantasy battles? Does that mean both systems are equally as good?   The main difference, at the highest level, is that one system has rank-and-file and the other doesn't. That's it. That doesn't make either not a game of fantasy battles."

Not really. The one and only basic component of a game of fantasy battles is a fantasy setting. If there was a Song of Ice And Fire tabletop game that was just based on the War of Five Kings that would still be a game of fantasy battles. Fantasy is the setting, battles are the ass-kicking that goes on in that setting.  The things you mentioned are things you expect from a game of fantasy battles. They're not needed for the game to be a game of fantasy battles. Really what you're saying is that AoS isn't what you expect from a game of fantasy battles so going to a game that gives you those things is important.   Have you tried AoS with a friend? Actually read the rules and tried to play a tactical game? I think you'd be pleasantly surprised. I don't miss facings or options or magic items at all. Points values would be nice. Balance I can do just looking at my opponents army. Let's just say I wouldn't play in an AoS tournament unless there were balancing rules.   But you can balance things without points values. I'm sure there'll be a system based of warscrolls that comes out eventually. Remember, we're just in 'open beta' here.   I'm not sure what you're looking for here? I can post next week after I've tried KoW to let you know that it is indeed better than Warhammer8th and AoS?   That would actually be awesome as long as you try to be impartial. A post of 'I played KoW and it's so much better than WFB and AoS wtf GW you suck I'm never buying any more Warhammer' would be doing a disservice to anyone you're trying to convert. Give them the facts. Tell us how WFB 8th ed did x better, that KoW does Y better, and that AoS doesn't stack up to what you expect from a tabletop game.  We're not all looking for pitched battles comprised of sacrificing moves for turning and charge arcs. I used to love it but I'm starting to get used to the idea that that won't be coming back. And I'm fine with it."

I get four hours a week at most to spend gaming and I really don't want to spend it pushing models into the middle of a board rolling 3s and 4s. If you want to define 'fantasy battle' as anything with wizards and unicorns that's great, but realizing that most people expect a little more is pretty key. Crossbows and Catapults was pretty sweet but I wouldn't consider it a fantasy battles game.  Have you tried KoW2.0, SAGA, Frostgrave, Darklands, Avatars of War fantasy game, or Shieldwolf Miniatures fantasy game? These are all infinitely cheaper than AoS and look to have actual strategy - decisions, sacrifices, movement, etc. - in them."

My local store has been teaching people the game since the rules were released. Getting an even matchup is actually quite easy - it just takes some common sense. Most of the games I saw played were even, the opponents just looked at each other's armies and said 'yeah, I know how strong each army is and this looks about even.'   And you know what? Almost everyone loved it. The most negative comment I heard was from the store owner who is a perpetual downer - he said 'I remain optimistic about it' after playing his first game, and was laughing at some idiot yelling waaagh when he charged his orcs by his second. The majority of people hating here haven't even played the game which is crazy. The people who don't like it after playing a few games get much more respect than those who just say 'oh no, no more ranks or points this game sucks I'm going to play KoW.'

It seems my area isn't very average b/c most people here are saying their neighborhood stores aren't really doing much with AoS. In my neighborhood store AoS has been killing it - and it's not even 'officially' out yet. I'm even sure several Warmahordes players will buy small forces to get into it. A couple hundred bucks will get you a great little army to play with.   It doesn't matter if people who were happy with 8th or earlier editions and had a complete army dislike this release. They can play the stuff that's already out there and GW has no reason to cater to them.   Exactly. I agree 100% with this. 8th edition was beloved by some, but I didn't like it.

They invade the planet by annihilating their population, then hijack the local defences/fortifications, so they get to fuck up the invasion fleet. Why do they do this? Because they see the most brutal, bloody and glorious combat to take place within enemy fortifications. So because of that, they kill an army just to kill another army."

Warhammer,3cjgyc,Walkemb,5,Wed Jul 8 21:30:35 2015 UTC,"I feel so bad for saying this because it's almost a cliché at this point. Thin your paints. They always look bad at first but once the paint dries you can add more thin layers which will give you a really smooth look.  Your brush work is really good though.  I consider myself a bit of a fluff buff, but I didn't know that. Cool."

Warhammer,3clhz3,stawk,9,Wed Jul 8 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Front and back. best way to do it. PLUS you really need some way to separate everything out.   http://www.boardgames.ca/images/products/detail/WarpwolfStalker.png  Look how easy that is to read. Dark background with the relevant items in light colored boxes. everything in its own well separated section. And on the back, clearly defined separation of all special rules using paragraphs, bolded titles, bullet point lists, etc.   Even with what you have right now it would be 110% better with different font sizes, bold names and tules, so on.   For example, your special rules.... Left align them instead of center align. Bold the name of the rule. separate it from the rule paragraph with dashes or colons Just visually look at the difference it makes:  Groinbiter. blah blah blah blah  Groinbiter -- blah blah blah blah  I could drop that bolded rule into the middle of those post somewhere and you'd be able to see where it is 6 feet away from your screen. I'd also do something with the stat headers (wound, hit, whatever). and don't be afraid to use different fonts or different sizes"

For example, the even spacing in the letters of the stat categories makes it hard to read. The spacing in the rules is very tight which in combination with a centered format makes it hard to see breaks in sentences."

I also posted it to show that even relatively simple techniques and a limited selection of paints can still produce good results.  The colours used for this were:  Tamiya Fine Surface Primer - Light Grey  Tamiya German Grey  Tamiya Flat White  Abaddon Black  Ceramite White  Leadbelcher  Castellan Green  Mournfang Brown  Agrax Earthshade  Mephiston Red  Celestra Grey (not major requirement)  Gehenna's Gold  The tools used were a basic selection of brushes. Emphasis on a small-medium flat brush for painting large surfaces quickly, a medium drybrush for drybrushing and painting mud and detail brushes for small areas. A household dishwashing sponge was used for weathering."
Warhammer,3ckufn,MrGraveRisen,3,Wed Jul 8 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly there's a lot you can do to improve on this. For one, you primed it light grey, hand painted it completely black, then repainted it white. And basically straight white over black too. that's a whole lot of wasted time. I would have started with the grey primer, pre-weather it with some brown shading, build up to white with preferably an airbrush, but if not then with thin glazes of white until it's nice and solid. OR prime white then weather and shade it down from there.   second, instead of using black paint to do scorch marks and weathering, try using black weathering powder. It's easier to ""smudge"" and blend, and is naturally very matte so it ends up looking a lot more like smoke and soot than black paint."
Warhammer,3cl0nn,Hatticus24,3,Wed Jul 8 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"I would give your wraithlord two bright lances instead of scatter laser/bright lance combo. The scatter laser no longer buffs the brightlance. And it gives your more things to deal with AV 14. Also, don't you have to give one of the dire avenger squads an exarch?  Don't give your exarch a tempest launcher, and give the entire squad krak missiles (Starshot?). Might want to fit in an ADL with icarus to deal with flyers. Dark reaper exarch on an icarus is nasty."
Warhammer,3cl0nn,grotms,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:54:46 2015 UTC,"Was thinking about that for the Wraithlords, maybe one with bright lances and one with scatter lasers.  For the Dire Avengers Shrine, you don't have to take an exarch, but if you do you can only take one. You have to have an exarch for each squad in the Aspect Host formation.  Good call about the Reapers exarch, will look at points. Is the weapon upgrade for Warp Spiders exarch worth it in your opinion?"
Warhammer,3cl0nn,MrNobleGuy,3,Wed Jul 8 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"I dont usually take the twin linked upgrade on the spiders, he is BS 6 anyway. I would strongly recommend going for the Warhost if you want to run this. Dropping one Wraithlord will get you close and the 6in run is fantastic."
Warhammer,3cl0nn,grotms,3,Wed Jul 8 20:27:46 2015 UTC,Twin linking BS 5 isn't really worth it in my opinion. going from 85% hit rate to 99%? I feel link 85% is good enough.

Warhammer,3ck36f,biggles86,2,Wed Jul 8 17:27:15 2015 UTC,Doing it by weight might actually work. It also gives GW the opportunity to sell limited edition tournament scales with gaudy decoration for £350 a sset!

Rather than agreeing to a game with Armies of X points. you'll agree to an army for Scenario X. I'm guessing each scenario will have army composition rules (# of heros, # of duplicate warscrolls, etc), and objectives based partially on model count, so the player with fewer models will have different goals within the game than the player with more models."

The game is set at 6 warpscrolls so your opponent has similar options."

""A point value system"" in no way guarantees balance.    We haven't gotten the whole game yet. Sure, there's rules and warscrolls popping up, but it's not the complete package.  I 'm really interested to see what the narrative campaign restrictions and tournament list requirements will be.  It might be as simple as a basic force org chart and model count caps per warscroll/race, which could be fairly elegant."

Maybe certain warscrolls will have a limit on the number of units or wounds you can have depending on the scenario or certain formations.   Sorta reminds me of Flames of War for some reason, though they use a point system you're still restricted in what you can take (and even the army you can use) based on the time period and what company you take."

And confirmed from GW at Forgeworld Open Day, there are no points and will be no points in this game.  EDIT that being said, there are several ideas for balancing the game with community-made points systems being tested, some of which are showing some SOLID promise - MWG Steve did a video battle report using his system, and it looked like the most competitive/balanced game of AoS that I have yet seen since we got the warscrolls/rules on Friday/Saturday of last week."

But it breaks down immediately when you step outside the bubble of units he was talking about - there are a huge number of box sets set around the same $25-35 price range, that are in no way equivalent - and more that for some reason are around the $50-60 price range, for only 3-10 models.   The most poignant example I saw was wych elves for $60 for 10 - 10 wych elves (or hell, sisters of slaughter, go for it) vs. 21 chaos warriors for the same price point (roughly $2.91 per CW model); not even a contest."

Warhammer,3ck36f,mrscienceguy1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"The system he used was (wounds + total number of attacks) X bravery = points  He also modified it so that D3 attacks counted as ""2"" for points purposes, and D6 attacks counted as ""4"" for points purposes.   Then he doubled the cost of the unit if it was a warmachine or a monster/ridden monster. It worked out pretty well, and my buddy and I played through a few games using that format last night and it felt pretty well balanced - the biggest issues we ran into weren't really due to the balance of the armies, but the overall prevalence of summoning and how easy it is to bring on monsters and units that can then charge immediately; so we're trying to find a balanced way to limit the size of a summoned unit at the moment, to continue testing."
Warhammer,3ck36f,ChicagoCowboy,3,Thu Jul 9 13:41:22 2015 UTC,I just really don't understand how this game is supposed to be balanced with the base rules currently out.
Warhammer,3ck36f,lemonjpoodington,2,Wed Jul 8 16:53:14 2015 UTC,It's not. the basic rules are just that. They give you the framework. Balance rules will vary from scenario to scenario.
Warhammer,3ck36f,feor1300,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't surprise me if GW started just defining whats in an army of a certain size. So they could define Skirmish/Raid/Battle/War levels and release 'army lists' of the forces that were actually in that army. So they'd release say:  Krull the dismembered's raiders  Raid Level  Krull - Chaos Lord - Axes  10 Chaos warriors AHW mark of Khorne  20 marauders with flails and drummer  10 chaos warhounds  3 chaos spawn of khorne  20 warauders with shields  10 marauder horsemen with axes  probably some whacky special rule: Padded crotch - ""If Krull suffers a mortal wound roll a dice, on a 6 the wound is ignored""   This method would allow GW to sell ""battle boxes"" with limited edition army scrolls containing all the models you need. would be quite fun imo"
Warhammer,3ck36f,Viktor113,-4,Thu Jul 9 09:49:46 2015 UTC,"I assume over the next 6 months - 1 year we'll see GW trim the fat from the game. The units available to pick from will decrease and the unit sizes will become balanced against each other's warscroll. We'll have one type of Bretonnian knight, one type of Empire footsoldier, one type of skeleton spearman/archer for both undead armies, one type of cannon for the 'good' guys, etc. I think eventually when you agree on a '5 warscroll game' you'll find that it will end up quite balanced.  I think the free rules are only free now to get people playing the game with their current armies before GW begins the process of elimination that will inevitably follow the advent of new 'army books.'"

Also, I wish the stormcast eternals looked more appropriately adorned for the warriors of the incarnate of heavens. If you look at the empire celestial wizard, the same kind of symbols should've been used on the stormcasts (suns, moons, and comets) not fucking lighting bolts on every scrap of armour.

The race I see being hardest to implement as a playable race is Chaos ... you could use similar mechanisms to O&G"

Warhammer,3cho4o,TheRights,3,Wed Jul 8 12:09:20 2015 UTC,I thought so too but my friend pointed out that the spell in on the warscroll being summoned. So you need for example one unit of zombies to summon more. Which means no single unit armies! oh and  it looks like its a max of 10 models for most summoned units
Warhammer,3cho4o,shauni55,4,Wed Jul 8 12:21:50 2015 UTC,"that's a very good point actually, thanks for pointing that out! Still curious, can anyone explain the fluff as to how LM summon? Do they come down in comets? are LM deep striking?!"

Warhammer,3cho4o,Cushions,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:31:51 2015 UTC,I don't think that is true at all. I think it's on their warscrolls because it would clutter up a Slaan's scroll if it had all of those separate rules.
Warhammer,3cho4o,TheRights,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:06:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree, if you look at the LM the slaan are  specifically given three spells. Then for each war-scroll that can be summoned on the field the slaan gain an spell on top of what they already know."

Warhammer,3cho4o,AdmiralCrackbar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:00:21 2015 UTC,"It isn't hard to say for sure at all.  The spell is part of the rules of the unit you want to summon.  For example Saurus Warriors have the spell ""Sumon Saurus"".  The rules for the spell grant all Slann Wizards the ""Summon Saurus"" spell.  You need the warscroll to get the rules, and you need the unit to take the warscroll.  If you don't have that unit, you don't have that warscroll and therefore you don't have the spell.  This also means that if your unit is wiped out during the game you no longer have access to that warscroll or the rules on it, meaning your summoner loses access to the summoning spell for that unit."
Warhammer,3cho4o,gwarsh41,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:38:22 2015 UTC,"The spell to summon a daemon isn't an ability on the warscroll that grants a caster the spell to summon a daemon.

Warhammer,3cho4o,TheRights,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"What do you mean about that? Just above the actual spell is    summon Daemons: Chaos Wizards know the Summon Herald of Tzeentch spell, in addition to any others they know."

Warhammer,3cho4o,EternalRMG,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:26:25 2015 UTC,10 Marines cost about as much as 15 Guard....
Warhammer,3cho4o,bloodstainer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:36:05 2015 UTC,10 Marines < 15 Guards
Warhammer,3cho4o,gwarsh41,3,Wed Jul 8 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"In AoS, the guard would be pretty hoss. The peasant bowmen in AoS have a 5 to hit (4 if you have a paladin within range) and a 4 to wound. That is on everything. They also can, once per game, fire 3 times instead of once, and if there is more than 20, fire 4 times.   In AoS, the big scary stuff and the little ""cannon fodder"" are a lot closer to each other than you are used to with 40k. Imagine if 30 guardsmen had a decent chance at taking a wraithknight down in a single phase. From a 40k players perspective, it was really hard to grasp the unit balance until I played it.   That all being said, my blight kings were a freaking blender of pus, disease and rot. They are just so damn slow though."

Terminators cost more than grots.  Goblins were historically the least competent unit in the game, so this was the base price, and things scaled up from there.  This leads to things like a ten man tactical squad costing $40, but a ten man assault squad costing $82, despite the models being nearly identical (you're paying $42 more not for the jump packs models, but for their abilities in the game)."

Warhammer,3cho4o,Darkuwa,3,Wed Jul 8 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, for most units, the old points values are appropriate. Only the ones that received huge changes in performance relative to other units (such as Black Orcs, Mangler Squigs, etc), should be valued much differently.  So far I've gone through Lizardmen, OnG, and Daemons, using everything relative to a base profile with points assigned to it, and comparing relative performance, most units use similar points to their old ones (Daemon Core got cheaper, Esp. Bloodletters/Plaguebearers, being worth ~8 points/model under 20, and 9/10 per model over 20)  Monsters got a bit cheaper, with Greater Daemons being worth close to 300 points, and Kairos being ~400, and Monstrous Infantry got more expensive, most almost doubling in points effectiveness. (Kroxigor are worth ~80 or so).  For now, I would really suggest pulling out your old army books and using those points as the base for the models, increasing by 1-3 after 20/30 models based on the bonus they get, if any.  For Ogres, you will probably want to triple the cost of Ironguts, and double many of the other units, since Monstrous Infantry have received a huge boost across the board."

The damage refers to the damage taken by the monster. So for instance, Eltharion on Stormwing, when it has suffered 0-2 wounds, moves 16"", has 6 attacks with its Wicked Talons, and it's Razor-sharp Brake hits on a 3+. All of these values get worse as you suffer more wounds. Really fun mechanic if you ask me, and helps balance out some of the big models in the game."

Warhammer,3cfile,AHistoricalFigure,2,Tue Jul 7 16:51:37 2015 UTC,What is that shade of blue? Its seems a bit...ultramarine to me
Warhammer,3cfile,Psykodamber,2,Wed Jul 8 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"I used a mix of Mordian and Enchanted blues from the old GW line, with a few glazes and washes to darken it."
Warhammer,3cfile,lolizard,0,Wed Jul 8 02:28:47 2015 UTC,"It's a very well-painted miniature.  You're good with a brush, and you did some really attractive blending on the large armor segments.     That said, this is also my first time really seeing one of these models up close, and to be honest it's a horrible sculpt.  These Stormcast Eternals look like shit.  They completely violate the War-fantasy aesthetic by trying to copy and transplant warmachine's."
Warhammer,3cfile,AHistoricalFigure,3,Tue Jul 7 17:54:51 2015 UTC,I do get a cygnar vipe from the models.

Warhammer,3cfile,PaintAndPlastic,4,Wed Jul 8 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"Bulbous steroidal fantasy infantry in super-heavy armor is kind of the whole Warmachine look, but you can head over to privateerpress.com and take your pick.  Off the cuff, I think they remind me of Cygnar Stormblade Knights in particular.      My belief that GW is trying to turn Warhammer into Warmachine is more based on the fact that the AoS rules look a hell of a lot like Warmachine.  The 'warscrolls' in particular directly copy the format of Warmachine unit cards.  I know in my area at least WFB has lot a ton of players to the Warmahordes group, and from what I hear that's a growing trend."
Warhammer,3cfile,thegoldend6,3,Wed Jul 8 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"I agree about the steroidal fantasy infantry bit; that is definitely going on here.  While I do like the new stormcast minis, they seem really generic. Like, not even trying to copy Warmahordes. I feel like you could use this mini in pretty much any game with an appropriate paintjob and maybe some added character. I don't know that much about Warhammer Fantasy fluff, but they don't seem to really fit with the look of the rest of the armies' (I guess you could call it grim high fantasy?) aesthetic.  Maybe that's what they were going for though."

Warhammer,3cgu3e,Rackalack,10,Tue Jul 7 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"Seems most of the percieved lack of strategy stems from people doing pile ins and charges wrong. Firstly, you have to pile in the direction of the nearest enemy model. Straight to it. Secondly, when you're making a charge move you just declare that your unit is gonna make a charge move. Not a target. Then you roll. Then you move the model up to that many inches ending the move within half an inch of any legal enemy model. That is when you maneuver your troops to really get the most attacks in while keeping as many of your opponents models from getting a good pile in when they attack. Setting up how the pile is gonna happen is super strong and that's what flanking is going to feel like from now on. But the charge roll is going to give you your options. If you aren't doing these things then, yea, it's gonna feel like all you're doing is racing to the middle and throwing dice. It's gonna feel that way because you are basically just racing to the middle, piling in and throwing dice."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,Thorgate,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:10:51 2015 UTC,This has been a less emphasized part of 40k for awhile. Watching a good CC player work is really entertaining.
Warhammer,3cgu3e,MrNobleGuy,7,Thu Jul 9 23:30:51 2015 UTC,"AoS strategy will evolve over time, but right now with the rules we have the decisive strategy is ""have high powered units"" and the favorite strategy elements from Warhammer are missing (army design, tactical movement etc)  That's not to say AoS can't be fun, or won't be improved (we don't even have the rules for all the units in the starter box yet) but using the rules we have today and the models we have today makes for a weaker game than Warhammer 8th or a lot of alternatives and without any promise of evolving interesting strategy."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,DrStalker,3,Wed Jul 8 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ on the lack of strategy - after a few games i developed a fade away tactic for my Bretonnians thanks to the retreat then run option to help me get away from fights where my knights weren't charging to have a second try to do damage for their charge bonuses in the next turn. monsters and sigmarines melt equally under the sheer damage basic knights can do should the dice gods favor me after pulling off successful charges. other than that luck and chance will always remain as an ever present part of wargaming. Like OP says i agree that AoS actually have some depth despite all this negativity - you just have to give it a try and don't be jerks like a lot of sceptical reviewers (seen enough where they skewed games to make AoS a bad system - along with incorrect rules).  AoS will see a focused release for the next few months, the best way is to just try the system out and agree to a fixed army condition (ours is 5 warscrolls, no hero duplicates, calculate wounds over models for sudden death) and you should be golden. Just hope GW will have some sort of army cap and more scenarios with victory conditions other than kill everything.   until then happy wargaming"
Warhammer,3cgu3e,sleepingforrest,7,Wed Jul 8 07:44:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for posting this. I'm looking forward to seeing more strategy & tactics emerge. I haven't yet played AoS, but I've caught myself yelling at the screen as I watch battle reports on YouTube. Areas that I'm looking to explore:   Screening. As you mentioned, a screen of troops looks essential for protecting characters and artillery. (Spreading a unit too far seems to make it vulnerable to too many missile attacks and charge arcs, however.) Combat resolution order. I've seen a lot of sloppy play here, too. Combined attacks & refused flank. Lots of people just marching in a straight line and getting stuck in because they can. They end up with a bunch of 1v1 unit battles. I suspect the art of AoS is doing as much damage as you can on a single unit in a single turn so that they'll evaporate due to battleshock, which means concentrating fire, overlapping charge arcs, and winning the flanks. Conversely, don't leave your units exposed. Retreating + Recharging. With Bretonnian cavalry? Holy crap. Hit-and-run looks brutal. Terrain. Some of the terrain features are really nasty, and I haven't seen anyone try to exploit those bonuses yet. Attack more aggressively when you go second in a turn. If you are going second, you have 50/50 odds to move in a bunch of units, fight on your terms, and then do it all over again before your opponent gets a chance to reinforce."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,outofbort,4,Wed Jul 8 08:37:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Warhammer (or any tabletop game) in years but AoS makes me want to come back. Why? Because it's Warmahordes without having to learn an extra rules set. It's deceptively deep, too, considering the...4?... pages of rules.  I think this subreddit has been, in general, seriously misrepresenting AoS because they're upset Fantasy is gone. They feel like a rug was pulled out from under them. But even I knew Fantasy was done as the End Times stuff started, and I could tell all that from one white dwarf I skimmed through at a friend's house.   I stopped playing years ago because the rules for 40k and Fantasy became super-simplified and took out a lot of what I loved about the game. So I understand where the complainers are coming from. This wasn't the first time GW changed everything, and it won't be the last. For the first time, though, I think GW did what was not only best for themselves but for the game. Pitched battles like old Fantasy aren't really done anymore. The echo chamber that is this sub makes them seem so much more popular than they really are. Most people that I grew up playing with have jobs and kids now and they can't play a four or five hour Fantasy game just because. This AoS game is deep, fun, quick, and quirky. I've spoken to my buddy (who owns a local store) and he said that people are coming in after work or after dinner for quick games. He's never seen so many people playing Warhammer in his store. More people are playing AoS than 40k, and almost as many people are playing AoS as Warmahordes...  EDIT: To add to my previous comment: I think people in my area are loving AoS because they're coming from Warmahordes. Most of them gave up on Fantasy with the advent of 8th edition, which I wasn't a fan of either, and picked up Warmahordes. AoS is competing with the wider market, they're not just looking to fill a small niche anymore. And with how simple their rules are and how easy the game is to pick up I think they're doing a great job so far. It can only get better from here. Especially since people who turned their back on GW seem to be getting sucked back in, albeit cautiously."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,kde01,2,Wed Jul 8 13:48:29 2015 UTC,"What makes you think the game is Warmahordes?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on AoS (I just picked up a salty guy's painted army for hella cheap just to play some beer and pretzel AOS with buddies), but the system is infinitely less developed than PP's ruleset."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,Raurth,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:59:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it is, I just said it's like. The game is gravitating towards a card-based skirmish with a small amount of units and very strong and important monsters and heroes. Watching AoS played reminded me of Warmahordes a bit in the way the players approached the battle, combat, magic, etc. Then again the players that I watch generally play Warmahordes and didn't get into that whole 'middle of the table melee pit' everyone is complaining about. There were a lot of cool and sly plays I thought. Yes, Fantasy was more obvious in how your strategy would play out and how you could adjust your tactics but in AoS the same can happen, just more subtly.   Too many people take Warhammer (Fantasy and 40k) at face value. They look at the rules and they run at each other. It's so much more. If you really slow down your game and think through what you're doing you can have a lot of fun. I see AoS being the epitome of this."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,kde01,4,Wed Jul 8 18:19:57 2015 UTC,Perfect post on why AoS is going to be a hit. The only thing they REALLY need to deal with is balancing issues and it'll be awesome
Warhammer,3cgu3e,noreservations81590,0,Wed Jul 8 14:19:17 2015 UTC,some of the terrain features are really nasty   Yes. If I had one complaint about AoS it's that I'm only supposed to use up to 3 terrain pieces. One of my matches had that piece that increases your bravery if your on/near it and it was a life saver. literally.
Warhammer,3cgu3e,fishmode24,5,Wed Jul 8 13:08:42 2015 UTC,"It's up to three terrain pieces per 2 feet square. If you're playing on a 6x4 standard table, that's up to 18 pieces!"

Warhammer,3cgu3e,learnin2walk,9,Wed Jul 8 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the hate is maybe a little misplaced. AoS has its strong points, and it has some weak points. But I agree with the core of a lot of people's argument against AoS... namely that it isn't Warhammer Fantasy as we know it. It is a diametric shift. It feels like this is a third game GW has come out with and at the same time nixed WHFB. I'll probably end up playing AoS because it's free, but don't expect me to spend a dime on the game because it just doesn't warrant that sort of (or any) investment."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,kroxigor01,16,Tue Jul 7 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"Just wanna chime in here. Games Workshop was very blunt when they said what they were doing. They said that they were ending fantasy in lieu of a new game. I sometimes feel like I'm the only person who read and understood that something like, 6 months or more ago when this news came to light.   With that being said, Fantasy is NOT dead. There are 8 editions of rules, and countless scenario books, army books, etc to be used. The game is just not receiving new updates, no new campaigns, etc. You know how many people still play D&D 2ed/3.5?   I really think folks need to stop the whining, pick up their WFB books and roll some dice. Play AoS for the sideshow that it is, I for one enjoy it (as a 40k player). I'd admittedly lose my shit at first if the same had been done to my game system, but in the end I'd have 7 editions of the game to fall back on and the numerous house made campaigns, scenarios, etc that I have in my possession. This is seeming more and more less like an actual argument for why the game is actually bad, and more like collective whining about how there won't be more content to digest.   This was typed in haste, but it's my split second thoughts on the subject, cheers and game on."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,buckeye1990,9,Wed Jul 8 00:58:39 2015 UTC,If i go into a GW and try to play 8th edition I'll get chucked out.  Will GW sue someone selling fan-updated warhammer rules? Probably. Hopeful a donation based system works then.

The person who runs my local GW told us at the pre-order thing that fantasy is dead. He said that there is going to be no secret 9th, no continuation, no sneaky age of sigmar turns into 9th suprise, just dead. It was heartbreaking to be honest but seeing as how that is the case and as how I do still have an army that I love I want to do my best to embrace something that turned out to be a lot better than expected."

Warhammer,3cgu3e,The_Fat_Lannister,2,Tue Jul 7 22:27:35 2015 UTC,you know KoW doesn't have ranks right? each unit is just a big entity with a series of wounds. It's interesting and a nice mass battles game but it's fairly bland and this 'alternative to fantasy' thing that's going round is mainly (clever) PR from mantic  I have no idea how they intend to make money from free rules when they hardly make the best models on the market but hey ho
Warhammer,3cgu3e,sparklethong,6,Tue Jul 7 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"Flank charges and unit placement mean so much in KoW though.   I do wish there was a mechanic where units with many wounds counters were less effective though (your 13 nerve unit could take 7 wounds, roll a 3 on the nerve check and fight at full capacity. In WHFB 8th edition your unit would fight at ~30% capacity).  Basically i wish there was another wavering like mechanic at about -5 from rout that gave the unit -1 to all to hit and to wound next turn? Obviously points and nerve stats would have to be rebalanced."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,TheActualAWdeV,3,Wed Jul 8 01:44:40 2015 UTC,It's still more Fantasy than Age of Sigmar.

Warhammer,3cgu3e,midmar,-1,Wed Jul 8 05:32:05 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the hate is maybe a little misplaced.   Yeah, but so is aos."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,remynotmartin,5,Wed Jul 8 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that AoS has a surprising depth of strategy involved despite the basic ruleset (which people unfortunately still get wrong, mostly in alternating combat / player phase as well as LoS and shooting). Faction specific playstyle is also encouraged as playing Brettonians for AoS have taught me to use retreat and run for turn 1 then charge in turn 2 in the case I could not get the charge (Bretts do tons of damage on charge - like they should be). I think the bitterness and negativity surrounding it have clouded some veteran's opinions so harshly that they are not giving it a single chance at all or communicating with other players to try and have a semi-balanced game (locally we are running with 5 warscrolls, no hero duplicates and total wounds rather than models to calculate sudden death). Instead of speculating like the interwebs have been doing these past two weeks I had a few games and the system was a blast to get into fantasy battles.   As it currently stands everyone has to learn from scratch again and for some reason people are not happy with how certain units are no longer the blue chip units they were in WFB games (eg phoenix guards over swordmasters) as well as unit synergies boosts and warband wide builds. Furthermore the lack of the points system had people in knots over how units are not balanced - personally my AoS Bretonnians have KotR's over grail knights because of a) I don't feel like cheesing b) i dont want to say for the lady all day with a goblet in hand - which is my own personal choice. AoS have more narrative theme over unit effectiveness for the more casual minded players at its current point, I personally will wait until all the rules and updates are given out from GW in the coming months. In the meantime I'll be having fun with AoS in my local community.  Happy wargaming = )"
Warhammer,3cgu3e,TheActualAWdeV,6,Wed Jul 8 07:29:29 2015 UTC,"It's not that players are just complaining about the new game, it's just so shocking to see the height from which the game has fallen. It makes you wonder whether the company is worth backing at all. We see similar trends in many other gaming companies, a cater to the casual player, a lack of complexity and overall less variance (I think) in what a player can do with what they have. We are raising as a voice because we don't support these kinds of games. We are not just whining. We think they are less successful and less interesting, and we don't want to see gaming culture go that way. (This is all assumption btw, but it is what I gather.) You have to ask yourself why you play the game. Is it not because you enjoy basic strategy but also want the feeling of being a general in a fantastical realm? GW has completely stripped that feeling from the core game play mechanics. Something I always loved about Warhammer was that the rules were comprehensive and fair. Now we have neither. For example, OP talks about the choice in combat of who strikes first being a core strategy element. No-one cares because it is not cohesive with the world, with the idea. Armies don't attack in turns in real life, and its core stratagem is NOT AT ALL based upon that. The fact that game no longer tries to maintain the feeling of being a general in fantasy world just makes it feel hollow and washed out for me. It was really the whole reason for playing it, stat lines that varied hugely made the characters feel like they actually should ( elves weak in  toughness, lizards stronger) IT MADE SENSE. Now the game has so much less complexity and so many of rules ( the beautiful rules too, OMFG) have been taken away it just feels like dicerolling.  I might as well go and play chess as it will INDISPUTABLY offer more strategy than warhammer ever will. 8th edition at least was much better in the respect of combat initiative being based down to statlines (it makes SENSE an elf would attack first) and focussing heavily on movement as armies in reality really do. Look I understand I can still play 8th edition, and I get AoS is a new game. But the direction GW is taking with the brand means I can no longer support it. It just feels like they have bastardized and failed to understand the fundamentals of their own damn game."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,kde01,8,Wed Jul 8 01:52:10 2015 UTC,"GW is a business. Fantasy sales have been little, to non existent for the last 3-5 years.   The old cliche ""If you do what you always did, you'll get what you always got"" applies here. Simply putting out new content for 8th or even a new 9th edition wasn't going to make a blip on the radar, as far as increased model sales.  The main obstacles most retailers faced in getting customers involved in fantasy are: price, time from purchase to play, number of models required, and too complex of a rule set.   AoS addresses all of these, while still allowing veteran players to participate IF they chose to. Let's be real, this is not about the 10+ year players that have every model they'll ever need. GW isn't making money off those people anymore. Atleast not enough to warrant supporting the same type of game system. They need new hobbyists and AoS gives them the ability to do that for Fantasy. Like it or not, it's a smart business decision."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,midmar,11,Wed Jul 8 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"GW is a business. Fantasy sales have been little, to non existent for the last 3-5 years.   That is, in my opinion, because they don't do a goddamn thing any other business does. Competitive pricing? Not at all. Everything is ludicrously expensive, scaring off customers.  Marketing? None whatsoever. 40K has a few games and even a movie. That gets you noticed and gets you sales.  Warhammer itself? Lol no. Sure, there have been a few games but no recent game that actually fits what warhammer is. Roleplay games are nice but warhammer was not a roleplay game.  The one game that could have brought in a lot of interest is total warhammer and they went and gone and changed their shit before that game is finished!  I don't know what's going on at GW but they're not really good at this running a business thing. Don't give a shit about old customers and only try to get new ones by making new products and not by any kind of marketing."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,remynotmartin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:15:26 2015 UTC,"Traditional Warhammer Fantasy fit in it's own niche. No, Mantic's stuff isn't the same. None of the other Fantasy rank-and-file games had the same lore backing up the armies. GW didn't need to market Warhammer. Marketing it wouldn't have helped it much, if at all. Any boost Fantasy would have gotten from the Total Warhammer game would have been temporary.  Warhammer with AoS is now competing with many different tabletop games, namely Warmahordes. They're no longer in a niche. Now they have to market themselves and become more competitively priced. I'm sure we'll see these things happen because GW isn't stupid. They're adjusting their whole business model and evolving for a new generation."

What you should get is AoS is an objectively terrible release, and should be treated as such. GW should be now seen as a  business who threw out a thinly veiled cash cow that lacks creativity and direction.  The models are all right, as artists take passion in design. But the game designers obviously show no passion for a game they know is a failure anyway, they won't even talk to those who have played table top gaming often.

You do realize this company has been around for over 30 years now. How exactly are they going to make ""a quick buck"" off a new game system? Release one starter, and the beginning of a whole new narrative and then ""LOL JK WE'RE OUT"". Come on man. Not to mention there's still 40k. Which, last I checked is doing fine.

Kids buy into this stuff. By ""pull out"" i mean the updates will slow, the model release will slow and it will remain as it is for at least the next 2 years. This game could never have been made with passion, its obvious. I believe the company has seen an overhaul so mentioning the 30 years is redundant. GW will never be what it was and that's the end of the story. Others will rise and fill the gap. I am butt hurt as I see this kind of trend everywhere and it disgusts me.

But not in my area. The local gaming store is buzzing about it. Everyone loves it. It even brought me back in to the store, and I hadn't been in three years. I'm now posting here again. AoS is a riot. It's really fun. And it's only simple and boring if the person playing the army is simple and boring.   But the game designers obviously show no passion for a game they know is a failure anyway, they won't even talk to those who have played table top gaming often.   I felt this way about 8th. I hated it. I think AoS is significantly better considering they pressed the big red reset button and are starting from square one.   Lets just be clear what makes a good game and good business.

Fantasy was less than 1/6th of GW's sales - it didn't even make sense to keep it around. They were probably losing money.  People don't want to play long ass games of rank-and-file troops anymore. The people in this sub creaming themselves over Mantic's game are a minority. The majority are those that player Infinity, Flames of War, Warmahordes, 40k, etc. Rank-and-file is dead. Long live rank-and-file."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,gwarsh41,4,Wed Jul 8 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"I think if you add objectives into the game it will actually end up more tactical than 8th, which doesn't cater very well to objective play, and in which you can often tell who will win once the board is set up, barring exceptional luck(or lack thereof) on one side, because while there are a lot of tactical moves you can make, most of them are rather straightforward/obvious. Sure, there are even games that are decided on one player making a mistake and the other capitalizing, but those match-ups are seeming more and more rare as the game has been figured out.  If you are playing an infantry army in 8th, there is very little you can do in terms of maneuvering, and against something like the WoC Chariot/Chimaera/Prince/unkillable BSB/Skullcrusher net list, if you don't have the tools to fight it (Which many armies don't), it's a loss unless something ridiculous happens, because you will not be able to choose combats unless they make a huge mistake, making your only option to play for a draw and castle in the corner to deny their mobility advantage if you want to have a shot at winning, which IMO, isn't fun.  Swedish helped a bit with army balance, but it added other problems to make the game less fun, such as the high comp avoidance lists, that win games without killing anything. IMO, that's worse than wood elves. At least you get to roll dice vs wood elf cav avoidance.  With a relatively small (What would currently be ~1500 points or so) army, and a good number of objectives on the board (Think Domination from LoTR if you've played it), with a balanced army with shooting, magic, heroes, etc. movement and positioning will likely be key. Of course, combat will still be decided by armies, but IMO, you shouldn't be using points killed to determine the winner of games with AOS until a points system is set up to balance the armies."

Warhammer,3cgu3e,xSPYXEx,5,Wed Jul 8 02:47:45 2015 UTC,"I see this argument pop up a lot.  That you could field Fateweaver/Screaming Bell and win turn 1 (which is impossible since 13 is not a valid die roll in any way, but whatever).  Or that they just field 30 hero units and roll. Or even running an army of summoners and just spamming greater demons to win.  But, who's going to play you? You might get one game in like that, and get assigned to the role of ""That guy"". No one wants to play ""That guy"" in friendly games.   Even then, summoner armies will probably lose every time unless you bring proper support, or get sudden death. Remember that summoned units don't count towards the army total, but do count against casualties. Only bring 30 models, all summoners? Better hope I don't kill 30 of those summoned models, because I just did 100% to your model count. You'd have to hope for Sudden Death objectives to even win at that point."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,MrGraveRisen,3,Wed Jul 8 05:10:51 2015 UTC,"By including the result for 13 on the bell rules they made it a valid result.  Additionally Fateweaver does not state that the die roll has to be 1 through 6 or even valid, just that the user gets to choose the result.  I can claim I rolled ham sandwich if I want, it's just that ham sandwich does nothing like 13 ends the game.      The thing is, people will be ""that guy"" on accident, especially younger gamers, because the game is missing the most basic of balance mechanics and what balance mechanics they tried to add just make things worse.  If there is no restrictions then people are going to want to play their cool stuff that tends to be characters, knights, monsters, and basically the good stuff.  Then you plop down your thematic balanced army because the game balace is missing and now the person who wanted to play a game with his favorite models is the bad guy.  And sudden death, what a joke that is.  Due to no actual balance the game thinks the player with 20 greater daemons needs an advantage over the player with 30 skaven slaves.      Frankly it's easier to break the game than play it legitimately.  The rules as released so fat literally can not support a competitive environment or tournament play, both of which help keep the game interesting and grow the community.  It basically falls to the players to sit down and plan every aspect of the battle save the dice rolls ahead of time and then come to a gentleman's agreement for not breaking the game in one of a dozen ways during play if there is to be any sort of parity or balanced play."
Warhammer,3cgu3e,xSPYXEx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:50:45 2015 UTC,"I've had plenty of times in any GW game (or any game for that matter) where you or a friend are unintentionally ""that guy.""

I'll make sure to not do that again.""  We'll still have fun and we'll still be friends. That being said, I think this edition does give more agency to the players for better AND for worse.

It defeats the purpose of having a few specialized units, and makes unit selection not matter.  Why not just field all Command units, and save time and money on an army.  Everything hitting on a 3+ and wounding everything equally is flat and boring.  Wood Elf lords using a bow should miss very little of the time, for example.  Not 3+.  Undead skeletons shouldn't be able to utterly murder a dragon or wyvern with such relative ease.  I feel like they took a right turn in rebooting WHFB.  The only problem is it feels like they stopped half way between mordheim and 40k, while leaving on the side of the road everything the players like about each game."

Warhammer,3cfn4j,xamdou,6,Wed Jul 8 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"But it never took reading through a book in the middle of the game to determine to hit or to wound rolls in the first place - in either fantasy OR 40k (which still uses the system of course).   Having to look at every individual warscroll in order to double check what each unit hits and wounds on, rather than knowing the to hit and to wound chart (which was very simple to understand) is much more time consuming and difficult for new players.   Hell, its more difficult for old players too - because instead of knowing how WS will interact and how S/T will interact (like we have known for 30 years), I have to make sure I'm (and my opponents are) double checking every war scroll we play with or against to learn the new To Hit and To Wound rolls for individual models. What used to be a WS4 S/T4 model might now hit on a 4+ even vs goblins and elite characters alike, and depending on whether he takes a spear or a sword, he might be closer to S3 (wounding on a 5+) than S4, etc. etc. etc."

Warhammer,3cfn4j,ChicagoCowboy,41,Wed Jul 8 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"""It's fun!"" is not a good argument, it's what people use to defend what they do when they do not have a good argument. Yes, I can admit Age of Sigmar can be fun, that does not make it a good game.  The same is true for stuff like Muchkin, Monopoly, or Cards Against Humanity.  They can be fun, but they have limited replay value (especially back to back games) and are not actually very good games. Let's try to make actual points and be objective.     The Good: - Age of Sigmar has a very low barrier to entry. - Age of Sigmar has an easy to learn rule set. - Age of SIgmar can be played relatively quickly in a small skirmish. - Age of Sigmar may help introduce new players into Wargaming - The Battlescrolls is a solid concept by having all rules for a unit in a single and easy to reference location.      Now, let's look at the bad. - Age of Sigmar is a game with no real balance mechanic to setup or during the game.  The most basic balancing elements are simply missing. - The rules are poorly written even if they are short.  Both the main rules and the Battle Scroll rules. - Balance between units and armies is terrible at best. - Joke rules farther unbalance the game or can even break the game. - GW has shifted all responsibility for balance to the players and it's wholly up to them to make the battles have any sort of parity to avoid 1 sided slaughter. - The barrier to entry, while lower than previous fantasy or 40k, is still higher than competitors games.  Especially if the new player buys in via a GW store and is presented with only hideously overpriced tools such as clippers, glue, knives, and paint, which are also part of the experience. - The game is severely lacking any sort of tactics or depth.  Even playing or watching experienced players it typically devolves to a blob in the middle with ranged units firing into/out of it. - There is no critical thought required at any stage of the game.  No list design, no real choice on what spells to cast, no decision between move/cast/shoot/melee as you can do them all with no reason not to. - Unit and model upgrades are effectively pointless due to a lack of points.  There is no downside to taking upgrades so you'd be a fool to not just load on everything you can. - The joke rules are not something that should exist in the core product.  Does the player in a wheelchair never get an advantage because they can not dance for the Masque? Does a hobby which is already almost exclusively male really need to tell women that if you do not have a beard or a mustache that their army will never be as effective as someone that does?  Should we be offending our opponent and trying to start a fight so a character is better in a challenge?  And most disgustingly the mental illness stuff.  I have known people with mental illness and it is not a joke or something to be mocked for a reroll.  In the year 2015 we should not be doing schizophrenic blackface for a bonus. - Rolling for first player each turn is terrible design and farther removes strategy while also allowing a player who is already winning to snowball into a situation where the other player is totally helpless.  Also, it's just not fun in larger games to sit back and watch the other player go again and again. - The game as written and released can not be played in a competitive or tournament format without being errata'd and adjusted by players until it may as well be a different game. - It's just boring.  Roll 3+ then 4+ or 4+ then 3+ over and over and over.  It does not matter what I am attacking or what is attacking me the rolls are always the same and a goblin wounds a dragon as easy as it wounds another goblin.  There are many, many more problems as well but this game is terrible on a fundamental level  If I play Warmachine with my friends I can text them or post on facebook that I am looking to play a 50 point game and we each show up with 50 points that will be playable as the rules are tight and the units/factions have a good overall balance against each other.  If I play X-Wing I can say I am bringing 25 or 40 points of ships and my opponent will likewise show up with a similar points value of ships. We just put them down, maybe throw out some asteroids, and get into playing because the game rules are tight and the balance is good.  If I'm playing a game of 40k I can say I'm playing 1,500 points and my opponent will also bring 1,500 points and we can have a game. It may be more lopsided than the games above but with objectives and good terrain or play it should at least be a game.  The same is true for basically every single miniature game out there which is not historical and which can be played at a competitive tournament level by just telling the players what points level the event will be running and any special rules the event organizer is using (if any).  Age of Sigmar is a bad game because it is lacking the most basic elements of competitive play and balanced game play. When you have a well written and tight set of rules as your base that is the foundation you work off of and gives the players the footing they need. You can add scenarios on top of it, league play with additional rules, or wacky stuff that can make the game more random but without that solid base you've got nothing. And Age of Sigmar can not decide if their base should be round, or square, or if there should even be a base at all since they can be a liability for actually getting into combat."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,tobetossedaway,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"""It's fun!"" is not a good argument, it's what people use to defend what they do when they do not have a good argument.   That's the only bit of your argument I don't agree with so it's the only bit I'll address. Don't think I am a GW apologist or that I really love AoS. I just think it's an acceptable product for what it wants to do.  I think you can say that the game being fun is a good argument because ultimately if it isn't fun for that one person, they won't do it. I am not a martyr. I will not line up 2,000 points of space wolves and have your 2,000 points of Eldar absolutely decimate me all day long. I've played in many 40k tournaments and have found the top 1/3 of the tables to be gamey, cheese mongers who only find the game fun because they are winning. It's always been a tactic of mine to throw the opening game in a weekend tournament so the rest of it is more fun.   Fun is a matter of opinion though and that's why it's a weaker argument. Your fun sounds like a more balanced game with more obvious rules with less wiggle room for cheaty folk to interpret the rules. Mine probably is too. But we've never had that. Why can Space Marines take 3 vindicators for one slot but Blood Angels and Space Wolves can't? Why do my Orcs randomly do nothing in a game while my Undead friend can summon a terrorgheist?   Competitive GW in a tournament sense have never been balanced, fair or otherwise. It's nearly always predictable what meta for each game will win in an event. The game that some people wanted has never existed and people are crying for something that didn't actually work at its core.  GW have no interest in making 10-15 very balanced army books, primarily because it's hard to do and secondly because it doesn't sell models.  I can't blame them for basically producing a rules lite and saying ""do what you like with this"" because everytime they've released an edition, it's been broken apart by online keyboard strategists and mathammerers within days."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,Kijamon,14,Tue Jul 7 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying people should not do something if they find it fun.  If people find Age of Sigmar fun then by all means, do not listen to me and play it, have fun.      The problem is that people think ""It's fun"" is an actual argument for something and what they always fall back on when they can not make a good argument.  Someone can tell me that sicking a large metal rod in my dick is fun and while that can certainly be true it's not something which is convincing or an actual argument as to why I should stick a metal rod in my dick. An analogy to ""It's fun"" would be if someone came to recommend a restaurant and told me ""It's food"" or the best they could say about it was ""I was not hungry afterwards"".    The main problem I am seeing for you is that you're just playing GW games.  I don't know if you play anything else but if not I can certainly understand as I very much love the 40k (and 30K) setting while they also put out some fantastic kits.  I really do wish GW would balance their armies, both against each other and even within the army book itself.  They are so committed to not being a tournament game that it's insane the hoops event and tournament organizers have to go through to errata and restrict until you can get a rough semblance of balance and even then it's the same things over and over again. Frankly, Age of Sigmar is so bad I'm fully out of GW now.  I firesold my fantasy for pennies on the dollar and will be unloading my last 40k at the first opportunity out of fear of ""Age of Emperor"" coming to 40k as over the years they've made many of the same choices such as rebranding existing lines into more trademarkable names, the bullshit that is unbound, and a constant push to just take everything you want to take instead of worrying about balance or composition. After moving into X-Wing and Warmachine I am much happier at casual game nights and when I get to make tournaments.  I may still buy or keep the occasional GW figure (always at a discount via 3rd party and never GW direct) but I can not see myself ever playing their games unless they make a drastic change and start taking balance and competitive play seriously and realize solid rules and good army parity is a stable foundation for community growth and players to build from."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,tobetossedaway,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"If you want perfectly balanced games stay away from GW, it's really as simple as that. It seems you've been a war gamer for a while so you probably know this. Why is everyone so surprised by AoS? GW has ALWAYS has shoddy and loose rules.That's why they say they're a model company first. They don't care about the rules. They want to sell models and they're doing pretty well on that front. Admittedly the AoS rules are especially loose but were not even sure we've seen all the rules or balancing yet considering how close to the chest GW plays things.  Basically, if you want to have a highly competitive tournament setting stick to warmahordes. If you want to play casual games for fun based in the great warhammer universe then play warhammer or 40k"
Warhammer,3cfn4j,noreservations81590,2,Wed Jul 8 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"""It's fun"" is certainly a solid argument for particular activities. You might not feel is determinative in this context, but it's a great barometer when deciding if we should ride the rollercoaster for instance.

Warhammer,3cfn4j,Revoran,-1,Wed Jul 8 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"Age of Sigmar is a bad game because it is lacking the most basic elements of competitive play and balanced game play.   I feel like the game is best played as warhammer was originally intended to be played back in the 1980s. You really need three players: the two opposing each other with armies, and a third one who limits the size of forces the others can play with and sets scenario objectives and special rules, much like a dm in D&D. It clearly isn't designed as a competitive game, but there are other kinds of games out there."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,hylas,5,Wed Jul 8 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"I could almost see that being the case.  The problem is that it completely ignores 30+ years of game design advancement and lessons learned.  Games Workshop is no longer the only game in town and other companies are right there releasing extremely strong products with better rules and at better prices.  GW has the long term brand advantage but that alone will not be enough forever and releasing a game this broken is just insane to me.  Like, I could understand if it were a $50.00 boardgame or a one-off or something but this is clearly intended for a flagship product that's $125.00 before taxes starter and that's just part of the investment as you still need the hobby tools to assemble and paint everything.  Looking at the upcoming prices they're going to be charging insane amounts for individual models and the cost to entry outside of the starter set is going to be awful.  $50.00 boxes of Sigmarines and $33.00 for the mono-pose guy on the dragon-cat thing."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,tobetossedaway,2,Wed Jul 8 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"The $50 boxes of Stormcast Eternals allows you to build 4 different options from the looks of it (hammer/shield, sword/shield, dual hammers, greatsword) - so it's not the worst buy in the world, but should still be closer to $37 like a box of tac marines in my opinion.  The $33 kit is not the monopose drake riding guy from the starter set; its an on-foot hero model, similar to the other $33 clampack heroes released in 40k and fantasy in the past year."

Warhammer,3cfn4j,tobetossedaway,11,Tue Jul 7 23:02:07 2015 UTC,Ever think that maybe people need to set points costs so they can have fun by playing a somewhat balanced(ish) game?
Warhammer,3cfn4j,Kijamon,8,Tue Jul 7 15:42:48 2015 UTC,"The game rules do not allow competitive play.   I can pick one unit and never lose. Take one carrion from the tomb kings. Put them flying, never come down. You can't do anything but draw at best against that. It can win by sudden deathing you.  You can win on turn 1 if you pick two units. Fateweaver and a Screaming Bell.  There is no logical means to write a proper and just balanced game using the AoS warscrolls short of removing rules and editing it. Who is trustworthy enough to do such a task and how will our community accept it?  GW do not give a shit about tournaments any more and that's saying something coming from a company that never once balanced any book against another.  The mere fact that people downvote any one opposing that viewpoint is proof enough that our community can't be mature enough to discuss the pro's and con's."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,ngxp,20,Tue Jul 7 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"I think the big problem isn't competitive tournament play. Even in casual play you need to have a sense of fair boundaries, or it's just Calvinball.  The problem isn't about powergamers ruining it or whatever, it's that Games Workshop is asking us to do their work for them (e.g. create a framework for the game to be reasonably fair and balanced).  Points were useful in that you and your opponent didn't have to do the mental arithmetic to figure out what is balanced against what, something that GWS has entire style guidelines for.  Now, it's very possible to play against each other with two armies, and only during play realize the two armies are completely differently valued.  It's no longer a game in this sense, and about as pointless as smashing your figures together and making noises."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,Kijamon,2,Tue Jul 7 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's lost an element of tactics in its gameplay and army selection. My problem with AoS is that I can rock up with a van load of miniatures and you come with a shoe box - at some point I need to stop deploying or the game is over in 20 minutes.   The game seems designed entirely to be played within clubs and friend circles where you know roughly what each person will bring.  I just didn't find points to be particularly useful in 8th, even with the changes to up to 50% lords. I'll preface this by saying I'm a 40k and 30k fan way more than a WFB fan but any time I've played in my local meta the people would take manky lists any way and smash you. Nagash summoning loads of monsters, Chaos Dwarves magma cannoning you, Wood Elves archering the hell out of you. People will always gravitate towards the nasty units - even in AoS - because deep down people are cunts and people like to win.  Points don't prevent that, only a thorough and fair release of army books do. For those using 8th as the benchmark for a balanced game - Orc and Goblins are shit. They are a weak book compared to the other stuff. Are you going to use their points costs in a balanced AoS? Cause I would argue that's entirely unfair on those armies that never got the all singing all dancing versions of their books in time for 8th to die."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,tehnico,4,Tue Jul 7 16:17:06 2015 UTC,Orc and Goblins are shit.   Say that to someone who's gotten footed 6 times on one spell. The point of O&G was that absolutely any chaotic thing can happen.
Warhammer,3cfn4j,Kijamon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"And I love that about them. But that's only good if the Undead can have a cataclysmic collapse where the army turns on its general or the wood spirits get annoyed at the wood elves and kill them. Etc etc.  Making one army the zany super fun time one, another 3-4 mediocre or crap and another 3-4 amazing and strong does not make for a good time for those players."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,ChicagoCowboy,4,Tue Jul 7 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"Making one army the zany super fun time one, another 3-4 mediocre or crap and another 3-4 amazing and strong does not make for a good time for those players.   Ok, but yes that's exactly what it does, because that's what the background of that army is - no one played O&G because they wanted to play the most competitive army out there; they played them because they wanted the zany, crazy, ""oh my god I can't believe that just happened!"" moments.   8th Edition was unbalanced because of magic, and because of war machines being uncommonly good for their usually meager points cost. Not because the books themselves were unbalanced or over powered - that was what I loved about fantasy tournaments; anybody could win, because it came down to generalship more than anything else - unlike in 40k, which is almost entirely due to list design and min/maxing (not that there's anything wrong with that, I play both and enjoy both immensely for different reasons).   If you want to play a game where every option has the same advantages and disadvantages, play checkers. Just because armies had flavor or different fluff rules added to make them unique doesn't mean the game was unbalanced - and certainly not on par (or even in the same universe) as the unbalance we see with Age of Sigmar."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,rollawaythestone,4,Tue Jul 7 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"Have you played a game yet? How do you even play within your club or friend circle? Knowing what they will bring - even sitting down together and eyeballing what seems fair - can be impossible to even ""roughly balance"" the two forces."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,opticle,6,Tue Jul 7 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"Agree. Also lends itself to the ever present doubt that your win (or loss) was not deserved and was in part due to incorrect balance at the start.   Plus not everyone wants to faff around working out balance pre-game with one another, or have to adjust their force because someone else cries ""Balance!"". I don't have the time to waste 20-30mins attempting to balance and then 2 hours of gameplay on something that isn't balanced. The game and its rules are supposed to do that - the omission of this pretty fundamental aspect of any game is really, really odd.   I was a defender of AoS when it was incoming, but this is silly."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,noreservations81590,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly, points hardly balance anything. You still have to talk to your opponent about what armies both people plan on bringing (in both fantasy and 40k) if you want anything close to a balanced game. People are bitching about how GW is making us do their work in terms of balancing now with AoS but in reality it's always been like that."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,tobetossedaway,12,Wed Jul 8 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"The onus for game balance should not be on the player.  The game should be playable on a competitive, or at least not comically broken, level out of the box and should not require players to house rule and attempt to fix everything.  You may come up with a set of fixes and rules which makes the game perfect for your store, but then you travel to another store for games and they have their own completely different set of rules and fixes to the point where your not even playing the same game.  If it's broken out of the box then it's a bad game, and the fact that this is so hideously broken while clearly being intended as a flagship product has stripped away what little faith I had left in GW.      When playing another game from another company I do not have to jump through all the hoops and bullshit to make it a game.  50 points of Warmachine if 50 points and even if the balance between lists we show up with is not perfect at least its a game.  25 points of X-Wing is 25 points and the balance is so tight we are basically guaranteed a fun and competitive game. Age of Sigmar is missing even that most basic of mechanics."
Warhammer,3cfn4j,keeganadavis,4,Tue Jul 7 17:41:20 2015 UTC,It sounds like AoS has taken some notes from Yu-gi-oh.
Warhammer,3cfn4j,Kijamon,2,Tue Jul 7 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I agree with the direction GW have taken the game, in fact I just don't. As a skirmish game it's fine but as a 9th it's pish.  You're not going to convince people to play with Reddit V1.0 rules when Warseer, Dakkadakka, Swedish Comp, all the other forums will all independently be trying to work on their balance. Even if they did all collaborate and make one rules set, you're going to have people raging that their super unit is now weakened or crapper and not agree to using those rules.  It's a 4 page document, there is just far too much possibility to be a dick that it's not worth it. Just find people you enjoy playing against and do it. A good example -  My mate has found that he can 100% block line of sight by ranking his zombies on movement trays like bricks in a wall. So his vampires become untouchable behind that. Legal in the rules, nothing can stop it and he gets to hide a fair few guys behind a solid block and cast loads of magic.   I'm just dumbfounded that people who play in tournaments regularly think that points/tokens/limits/wound counts will somehow balance the game. It never was and never will be. GW want to sell shit, not keep their rules up to date."

And that's the beauty of the internet my friend; this is no longer the mid 90s gaming where a group of friends change rules in the basement and then try to get local stores to adopt them.   Shit, the game isn't even released yet, and we already have 3-4 VERY solid ideas to help balance the game. Now the masses take that under their wing, try it out, report back, fine tune it, and evolve the system.   Why do you think people create 1850 40k lists, with max 2 detachments/formations, allowed same-faction allies, limit 1 LoW up to 33% total points, limit 1 fortification regardless of detachments? Because that certainly isn't in the rulebook...its because the community at large tested various list building rules and changes, and the largest tournaments in the US landed on those as the most balanced and competitive, and now the US GT circuit uses them almost exclusively.   The same thing can and should happen for Age of Sigmar, to give us the best, most balanced and competitive system in which to play. And with enough play time and tweaking, the community as a whole will inevitably land on a system that takes a foothold and becomes the standard."

Fantasy was basically a dying game. AoS is really a business decision in reaction to this fact to attract new players, new players spend the most money.  TotalWar will allow all the people who really liked the scale and strategy in the old Fantasy franchise to continue to have that experience (even if not on the tabletop) now that AoS has been released.   Look at the TotalWar franchise, it really is a better medium for complex strategy than the tabletop.

Warhammer,3cbtpy,Equinox90,25,Mon Jul 6 18:16:53 2015 UTC,I am glad you liked it.  I have been liking all my games.  In our local GW we were running 50 wound lists.  First game was ogres and Wood elves vs chaos demons and orks.  Summons were a little bonkers but i think we were doing it wrong.  2nd game was 100 wounds of ogres vs 100 wounds of elves and britonian.  I enjoyed all the games i played and the ones I watched were fun too.  It has been a pretty positive reception in my shop and strangely enough my shop plays a ton of fantasy and hobbit.
Warhammer,3cbtpy,pkacidlord,15,Mon Jul 6 18:55:42 2015 UTC,I think the problem with wounds is that hurts horde armies like skagen and VC. 10 phoenix guard and 10 zombies have the same number of wounds but they are not close to being equal
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Knightfall2,2,Mon Jul 6 23:36:35 2015 UTC,"I thought that at first too but I just played a game to test that and boy was I wrong. I ran a zombie/Skeleton horde list and it was nasty. 10 Zombies compared to 10 Phoenix guard are not the same but when you turn that into 50 Zombies the first turn of the game with two spells that can't be dispelled since the enemy isn't in range it gets nasty real quick. Add a some synergy units and it's not hard to do at all. Then they are hitting on 2+ (Corpse cart in range) and wounding on a 3+. By turn four I had summoned 80 additional Zombies and had overwhelmed a dwarf list.   I think those units are balanced but they require you to taken them in larger groups, to be efficient, and have some synergy."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Eternal_Wight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:21:47 2015 UTC,The thing is you can keep summoning zombies but not Phoenix guard :v

Or, what I'm going to try next game, is to not write lists. The person who wins the roll off drops any unit down they want. Then the opponent drops one, in an attempt to counter it. Then you back back and forth until someone stops. Then the last guy can drop me and risk the sudden death option. So this way you have new tactics to what you deploy and when you stop deploying. It also balances the match by having every unit dropped be a counter to another unit."

Warhammer,3cbtpy,feor1300,2,Mon Jul 6 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming anyone who wants to bring 100 skeletons will just keep using movement trays. it's right in there with the Nid players who bring movement trays for their gaunts (I've seen it, he had like 150 gaunts on the table, plus the Gaunt pooping dude)."

Warhammer,3cbtpy,r_acrimonger,3,Mon Jul 6 21:19:56 2015 UTC,"He had put magnets in the bottoms of his bases and got a magnetic sheet to make the trays out of usually a tray would have 10-20 gaunts on it. Then he'd just keep about 15 or 20 gaunts loose around the tray, move any gaunts he had at the ""front"" of the unit, then move the trays to 2"" behind them, and then move the rest of the gaunts to 2"" behind the tray. that kept his gaunte from having to be rank & file line abreast, while still letting him move his unit in less than 5 minutes."

Warhammer,3cbtpy,gribblewielder,4,Tue Jul 7 20:11:05 2015 UTC,Because a 100 wounds of clanrats or night goblins can not possibly stand up to 100 wounds of Elves or Chaos warriors.

I'd love to jump in an play a game, but it'd be pure guesswork on what would be a balanced army with zero indication of cost from point values. ""Pick a few warscrolls"" doesn't work when things like phoenix guard are so much more powerful than spearmen etc. Points really help for determining fairness, even if you ballpark them."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,gribblewielder,2,Wed Jul 8 08:09:36 2015 UTC,"It is refreshing to see a positive Age of Sigmar thread. At my local GW shop there was a group of 6 players who also really seemed to enjoy themselves. They especially liked to agree on army size and see how it goes from there. Granted, the Vampire Counts player got destroyed as he put all his faith in Nagash, but still I could tell that the new system has its merits."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,scientist_tz,5,Tue Jul 7 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"When I played it, it degenerated into a massive melee. Is there much maneuver and shooting?"
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Inquisitorsz,2,Tue Jul 7 03:18:29 2015 UTC,There isn't much shooting unless you play a shooty army. My wood elf friend skirmishes alot.   The movement tactics comes with keeping your essential units safe but availible to join an assault if something gets hit.   I charged my foe and ended up getting to close to his general. So in combat he got to pile in and destroy my unit.
Warhammer,3cbtpy,deadeight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"It's easy to forget that you can safely back out of combat. Positioning is v important so you can control your engagements and try and get an advantage in combats compared to your enemy. If you don't like massive melee, Skinks can choose to fall back rather than pile in (which is hilarious) and there's a beastmen commander that allows you to retreat then charge."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Inquisitorsz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:27:37 2015 UTC,"Somewhat, maneuver I still feel is really important as it can be very hard to get entire units in melee range unless you charge a big unit in multiple flanks at once, especially with armies such as wood elves where with the glade guard's 20"" range on their bows and the wild rider's ability to run and charge means they could effectively shoot an enemy unit then charge some eternal guard in the front and wild riders in the rear.  I won't lie though compared to 40k or 8th edition WFB ranged and maneuver play has become much harder, greatly increased charge ranges and decreased shooting ranges make it difficult. As an Empire player I think i'll see myself using screens a lot more, such as having ranks of spearmen with handgunners in the back so they can see through the gaps to shoot so if someone goes after the handgunners they enter the melee range of the spearmen."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Eternal_Wight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:32:12 2015 UTC,I'm using handgunners in tight columns (because they can shoot through themselves) near a unit of greatswords (but spearmen would work too!) thanks to the counter charge/reaction fire rules
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Inquisitorsz,4,Tue Jul 7 09:28:34 2015 UTC,"Do the melee attack ranges seem to limit the effectiveness of hordes? It seems to me that if I plop down a single ""unit"" of 100 Orks who all have a 1"" attack range then it's gonna be tough for me to get too many of them into combat at once unless they're fighting a huge opposing unit.   Thus the ""abuse the game by putting down huge blocks of models"" seems like it becomes impractical."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Tigirus_Arius,3,Mon Jul 6 21:56:12 2015 UTC,Yeah the attack ranges definately do. But you'll be able to surround the opponent and get them stuck in combat forever. But everyone's play meta is different. I'm trying to sculpt my areas meta into more of an elite small warband kinda feel. So 50 or so models tops.
Warhammer,3cbtpy,AbbyHeddon,2,Mon Jul 6 22:05:53 2015 UTC,"I dunno about the surrounding thing. I thought that at first too, but: A pile in move is ""towards the closest enemy model"" so you can't really just wander on around the side of the unit.   Since the unit can't move when within 3"" of the enemy, you can't do much with the back of the unit except pile in..."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,passwordissharks,3,Mon Jul 6 23:44:07 2015 UTC,"A pile in move is ""towards the closest enemy model"" so you can't really just wander on around the side of the unit.

Warhammer,3cbtpy,AttackOfTheFries,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"Large units have many issues that aren't immediately apparent, their large size makes them easier to get charged but also means that opponents don't need to allocate attacks to different units they can just throw everything into the 1. While the Bravery bonus per 10 guys is nice and all as well it doesn't really help to mitigate the level of casualties you'll be taking.   For example here we'll say a unit of 100 took 20 casualties (which isn't that hard to do) if they had an average bravery of 7 the remaining 80 would take a test at (20-7-8) or die + 5 for their battleshock. Alternatively 5 units of 20 if the wounds were spread out it would be (4-7-1) or die -4 which is much safer, not to mention it's much harder to pile 3+ units into a 20 man unit."

Warhammer,3cbtpy,lordhughes,8,Tue Jul 7 09:40:44 2015 UTC,"Age is Sigmar seems to be violently polarizing. Either people really love it or hate it extremely; personally I am in the former group. The games I've played have be fun if a little confusing (new rules and all) but the only gripe I have and it's a bit of a big one in my opinion is the lack of objectives. Kill everything doesn't really work against armies that can summon things since it circumvents the sudden death objectives, hopefully they'll release a mission or campaign book later. Otherwise I might just make my own missions or adapt the steamroller missions."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,sleepingforrest,5,Mon Jul 6 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"Change always is polarizing. I can understand AoS, but at present I don't like it. The way I see it, they've simplified the ruleset to be more in line with wargames that appeal to a younger audience. I'm more put off by the lack of official suggestion of how to balance games and the fact that I generally don't like the fluff and aesthetics of the Stormcast Eternals (which irks me because I definitely started 40k as a pre-teen about 20 years ago because I though space marines were awesome). I never played fantasy, and AoS doesn't give me an impetus to start.    Simple vs complex is always going to be an argument with strongly held opinions. Simple, for the health of the game, is probably better because casual sells. Still, something is missing. The game doesn't feel that fantasy to me any more."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,Krushnieva,5,Mon Jul 6 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel. The game is ok...but it has lost its spirit.

Like my instincts are backwards."

Now most of my gaming group is getting disinterested because they don't like the new direction and are bummed about playing with old rules. I'm hoping we can just continue to play 8th.
Warhammer,3cbtpy,gribblewielder,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've seen that summon armies can shoot themselves in the foot. Especially if they don't trigger sudden death in their favor at the start.  From my understand of the win cons under similar model count armies, units summoned in don't add to the total army count, but count against you in terms of casualties."
Warhammer,3cbtpy,DestroyerFaith,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:38:48 2015 UTC,"dont you count summoned units as casualties toward your starting number though? so start with 100, summon 20 they all get wiped, then you lose 80 more from your non-summioned army and thats game.  rules say the losers go home if they lose but its hard to do that with 100% casualty rate.  Im sorta thinkong its intended for people to lose with troops still on the field... maybe?  summons are strong but could actually work against you by giving up ""victory points"" inthe form of the starting model number if played that way... shrug"

In our local GW we've decided to go with a 5 scrolls list (no more no less), no hero duplicates and wounds over models to calculate sudden death. AoS has seen me play more with random people rather than the same circle and it rekindled the hobby for me.   AoS is clearly not a game for D-bags as pretty evident from the rage and hate in the internet community. Having actually played it everyone I've talked with post game enjoyed it and learnt new tactics and strategies as we played more games. as for cheese list builders its going to be simple - like the 3 odd WFB players in my GW area who refused to be nice or friendly to people - no one wants to play plastic soldier wars with them = P AoS is the game for friendlier 'scrubs' as most community seemed to label us, but I'm having heaps of fun thus far and can't wait to see objective based scenarios in future updates."

But unfortunately the recent events have shown otherwise and further stereotypes. AoS to me seems like GW's attempt to try and make everyone play back like their very first game of warhammer or 40K as a kid and try to remind you what wargaming is about.   Coming in to store with a fixed points list at one point became a chore as to who brought what points to play with - whereas my games of AoS gave me that nostalgic rush of my first few games where both players come up with some narrative why our warbands are fighting and try to make the game work for each other in order to have fun in the next  30 or so minutes.   I hope you give it more plays, maybe in time after all the rage have settled things might look up for the WH community as a whole - rather than what we have to put up with now for our hobby. happy wargaming."

For example, lizardmen have a flamethrower that hits EVERYTHING within 8 inches, while some war machines multiply wounds against big hordes. Battleshock is also really really rough on big units. I'm loving the game so far; I'm playing the state troop detachment like a historical Tercio - lines of rifles with greatswords to support - and it's working really well."

Warhammer,3ceowk,jimjams1616,6,Tue Jul 7 09:27:22 2015 UTC,I'd make the tac squads smaller or bring in some scouts so you could bring something like a TFC.  I'd also drop the lightning claws and meltas on the sternies and instead bring some combi-weapons.  I'd also drop the plasma cannons on the Tac squads and instead bring missiles launchers.   I'd also drop the vet sergeants.
Warhammer,3ceowk,ELD3R_GoD,3,Tue Jul 7 11:08:26 2015 UTC,Questions: TFC? Why missiles over plasma? So i can put more points into sternguard?  If i make the tac squads smaller i cant take the plasma or missiles. And why drop the vet sgts?
Warhammer,3ceowk,ELD3R_GoD,5,Tue Jul 7 12:49:16 2015 UTC,"Thunder Fire Cannon. It is ALWAYS a good choice.  I just don't think Tac Squads are particularly good at any one thing and having them footslogging is even worse. With scouts getting a buff to BS, you can use them to sit back and snipe or infiltrate, whichever takes your fancy.  Add to that the chance of killing off one of your guys turn one especially with such a small number of units on the board, it will be felt.  If you intend to get them in to CC to make use of the vet sergeants without transports (and even then, they aren't particularly great) you are doing it wrong. Make use of bolter drills and keep your opponent in range.  I'd also consider using the formation for the Sternies if at all possible.  These are just my opinion, I'm sure others may disagree."
Warhammer,3ceowk,jimtheclowned,3,Tue Jul 7 13:16:34 2015 UTC,Its a weird area for the 1st company formation there. Sternguard lose Obsec because Kantor's rule is his detachment only (not army). Formation = new detachment if I recall correctly.  Fearless is meh cause you already can't get swept and auto regroup. How often do you actually get pinned? And blobbing something with Sternguard isn't the way to go. Fear is a meh rule too cause a lot of things are immune to fear from some way or another or have some way of make the test stupid easy.
Warhammer,3ceowk,ELD3R_GoD,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:36:56 2015 UTC,You are correct! Objective Secure is much more valuable!
Warhammer,3ceowk,jimtheclowned,2,Wed Jul 8 09:09:57 2015 UTC,"Drop the tac squads down to 5 men each.. Give them a rhino if you can, or run scouts. Or if you really want to waste 4 marines, give them a heavy weapon and don't bother with a special. Either way, the way you have them is not going to work that well. Pretty much have to combat squad them, and then you end up wasting 4 marines, while the other 5 walk down the board taking random pot shots at things.  Vsgt is pointless on units not built for close combat (so anything but assault marines and maybe bikes) and is even more pointless if you don't spend the points for a power weapon (the costs just keep adding and adding and adding) Just run him with a bolter and bolt pistol.   Field a devastator squad instead with all your new found points from reduced tac squads with all your heavy weapons and an extra marine or two for meat shields to suck up a wound here and there (missiles are ok, lascannons are best). You can get away with 4 missile launchers cause of chapter tactics. Run the libby in this unit on the divination table, take prescience and congrats, your devastators are now re rolling to hits and armour pens.   29 sternguard marines is a lot of points for squishy guys. I would probably drop one out right, and bring something along the lines of 2 stormtalons, or bikes, or just more troops choices to add bodies and buy goodies for the boys. Need combi weapons in here other wise your just going to be staring at the gun barrels of tanks all day and crying...or getting ram rodded by a walker of some type.   As good as sternguard are, they still die just as easy as a tactical marine, and let me tell you, tactical marines are one of the weirdest survivability units out there. Sure on paper they are great, but every failed save adds up. Only weapon upgrade you should ever see on these guys are special weapons, combi weapons, or a Hflamer. Everything else is a waste.   As it stands, 6 melta guns is probably going to do dick all (forgive the language, I just really like that expression) to armies fielding multiple transports and bigger tanks. Bring some more oomf to the party.   Bonus: You kinda want transports for marines. Your boys are expensive, and are only good in med/close ranges. Blob armies such as guard and orks and maybe even tau can get away with less transports cause their troops aren't made from gold bricks expensive. 14 pts / marine is quite a chunk of change, considering a guardsmen is about 5 pts each."
Warhammer,3cbwnv,ESLderp,8,Mon Jul 6 18:37:06 2015 UTC,"Finally got around to uploading a full gallery of my visit to Warhammer World a couple of weeks ago. The new exhibition rooms are incredible, pictures can't do justice to the scale of the dioramas, some are absolutely massive, and the Ultramarines vs Khorne one is total madness.  The first cabinets you see when you enter the exhibition are some of my faves; all late 70s and 80s stuff, the Rogue Trader-era stuff, a nice shelf of 2nd Ed. Orks and Gretchin, the legendary Blanche diorama, etc. Amazing stuff.  On looking at the gallery I realised I didn't take any pics of the Necron Vs Blood Angels diorama. That was because it was too dark to take pics with my crappy camera, seeing as I think it was meant to be a night battle."

Warhammer,3ceo4e,gribblewielder,4,Tue Jul 7 09:29:31 2015 UTC,"The white boxes is how they have shipped and sold that stuff for a long time. They are probably  waiting till all the old stock sells before replacing it or something.   And round versus square bases really doesn't matter. Everything  is measured from the model itself, so you could put it on a pizza box if you really wanted to and it wouldn't make a bit of difference."

Warhammer,3ceo4e,turkeygiant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:41:30 2015 UTC,GW models are great in terms of sculpt detail but the quality of other companies has rapidly closed the gap. GW are not alone in making quality models anymore.
Warhammer,3ceo4e,Vankraken,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:28:36 2015 UTC,"There are other companies that are certainly making quality minis, Privateer Press, Corvus Belli, CoolMiniOrNot are all making what are without doubt ""quality"" minis. None of them can say that they are making minis of the same quality as GW though IMO, as much as their minis have improved in the last 5 years so have GWs. I think this is a very important part of GW's business model, making sure they are without a doubt producing the best minis in the industry, and always improving them to stay ahead of the competition."
Warhammer,3ceo4e,turkeygiant,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ on that. There are quite a few smaller companies such as Kromlech  producing great resin models (also GW's choice of resin sucks) and there are even a few plastic producers who have great quality. The eisenkern valkir stand out as being amazing plastic models for cheaper than GW stuff. It's fine to like GW's stuff more but I think it's not ""without a doubt"" the best. As I said before the gap has closed and other companies are nipping at GW's heels in terms of quality models."
Warhammer,3ceo4e,Vankraken,3,Thu Jul 9 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"Lots of online products don't have nice packaging, it's just cheaper to print and since you've already bought it there is no need to put nice artwork on it, the same happened to me when I bought Planetary Empires a year ago. I would prefer they did though but this is GW, a chance to reduce costs by .5% is going to be taken."
Warhammer,3ceo4e,ShasLa40,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"O right, I've ordered a fair amount over the years and its always come in the proper packaging, never had this before so I figured if they arent even printing the boxes for brets then they are probably on their way out."
Warhammer,3ceo4e,wolfsark,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:38 2015 UTC,What were you buying before? They have been using those plain white boxes for older and more obscure things for a while.  I'm not surprised they gave you brettonians in a box like this.
Warhammer,3ceo4e,aura_enchanted,2,Wed Jul 8 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"According to my gdub brick n mortar store owner:  Square bases will be in all current product boxes until they are either repackaged, remoulded, or they run out of square bases after production of them ends at their model production facilities at an undisclosed point in time.  So square bases on existing products probably will not start to go away for at least till August and by that point it will still only be a drop in the pond over the number of square bases that will be available."
Warhammer,3ceo4e,saxonturner,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:52:42 2015 UTC,"I would of thought commen sense would tell people this, they are not gonna swap out bases in all their boxes and they probably have a hell of a lot stock piled to."

Warhammer,3cck9e,sonic_shock,2,Tue Jul 7 17:41:42 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be too hard to trace some Warhammer artwork to make colouring pages and put them up online.  Whereas minis cost money.
Warhammer,3cck9e,Revoran,3,Wed Jul 8 13:29:59 2015 UTC,Any chance the army builder portion will give some answer to the lack of points? Maybe a different system that will help balance things a bit?
Warhammer,3cck9e,Drewbary12,5,Mon Jul 6 23:54:06 2015 UTC,"The army building is supposed to be based on formations, scenarios and campaigns. There was a posting on one of the spoiler sites that they are apparently  going to produce hundreds."
Warhammer,3cck9e,AttackOfTheFries,6,Tue Jul 7 00:50:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting, so then do you think that pick up games will be more about ""which scenario do we have the models for"" rather than ""what is the point limit we can both field""?"
Warhammer,3cck9e,Drewbary12,3,Tue Jul 7 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds like it might be the case... although I generally don't like being told what i have to play with.  I very much dislike 40k formations for exactly that reason...  I hope there's more freedom in these ""campaigns"" than just take this list and play this other list."
Warhammer,3cck9e,Inquisitorsz,2,Tue Jul 7 06:03:02 2015 UTC,In the formations in the back of the existing warscrolls they run off of a theme. Like for OnG all the spider stuff together is a formation.
Warhammer,3cck9e,AttackOfTheFries,2,Tue Jul 7 09:09:31 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly play pickup games. There are probably  only 5 people (me, my brother, 2 friends and the flgs owner) who play fantasy here. That number may be growing soon as a few people have shown interest but we usually  work out what we are playing before hand and then bring models"

Warhammer,3cck9e,MrGraveRisen,-3,Tue Jul 7 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"$60 gets you every card for every faction with all special rules/rule references availble from within every unit entry. plus rules for every model added in the future, which you can also use as an army builder and can use in place of the unit cards to play the game and track damage with.   for the price of one 40k codex."
Warhammer,3cck9e,Mirarii,10,Tue Jul 7 04:19:39 2015 UTC,"And this app is free. All the rules, warscrolls, and functionality.   For the price of free.  I'm not knocking PP here, I love warmahordes. But the fact is GW is literally giving this away.   Edit: I should add that I understand you don't even need to buy codices with warmahordes which is great and I much prefer that system."
Warhammer,3cck9e,MrGraveRisen,-4,Tue Jul 7 04:24:55 2015 UTC,Because the AoS rules are already free.  the whole... 4 pages of rules and 2 pages for each faction. If they charged for already free rules they'd be..... well i wouldn't put that past them.
Warhammer,3cck9e,Mirarii,6,Tue Jul 7 04:26:12 2015 UTC,Then why bring up PP's app that charges for rules that come with models?   I get that it's not an original idea but battlescribe and other apps do the exact same thing for an incredibly nominal fee. Definitely not 60 dollars.
Warhammer,3cck9e,MrGraveRisen,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:48:49 2015 UTC,"you can order the cards from their site at 50 cents a piece. it's more or less part of the cost of buying a model. or a faction deck with only part of the cards available for $20.   it's incredibly reasonable. Point I was making though was that it's basically the same thing and GW finally caught up, and are no longer 5 years behind in technology. though their warhammer app is truly awful"
Warhammer,3cck9e,Inquisitorsz,7,Tue Jul 7 05:31:05 2015 UTC,"and yet this PP app has a rating of 2.8....  I agree GW needs to catch up but it's not like PP is smashing it out of the park with this one. It's had 10,000 - 50,000 downloads and hasn't been updated for 6 months."
Warhammer,3cck9e,MrGraveRisen,-2,Tue Jul 7 06:06:04 2015 UTC,"the app itself doesn't get updates, you log on through the account to download new units. last update was june 10th"

Warhammer,3cg0gq,sleepingforrest,14,Tue Jul 7 16:56:46 2015 UTC,"There's nothing stopping you from continuing to play 8th ed in your community.   Withdrawing the books from sale, removing most of the models from the store, and eventually replacing them.  This is a terminal diagnosis. We can hand down, copy, pass around books, but from this point on Warhammer Fantasy Battle cannot grow. It can only dwindle. Slowly and surely down to nothing.  The community was already small and feeble (from years of price rising and bad writing) :("
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Doomslicer,2,Tue Jul 7 19:58:16 2015 UTC,"Okay I can agree with you on the point of dwindling community as well as the GW's stance on price rising and steep model cost / army which had made the system even less appealing from potential players.  However the biggest point that made me dislike my local  WFB community was the players' inability to accomodate new players who were GENUINELY interested in the lore and idea of massed battles (which is what I liked about it). the veteran players' attitude  soured those who wanted to be part of the WFB circle, so most ended up in the 40K while the 3-4 grumbling veterans grumbled in their corner without helping interested noobs like myself in expanding the community. Not saying the general WFB community is toxic but it isn't as friendly as 40K guys in my local area."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Aiyon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"See, I had it the other way round. I stopped playing 40k because whenever I played with people they got annoyed with me for not knowing the rules off by heart, and whenever I tried to ask people questions they acted like I was being a nuisance by wanting to learn how to play.  When it came to fantasy, I had two guys sit with me and explain how magic works for like an hour, and one of them even let me use his army against the other to get a feel for the system.   I think the only reason people tend to be more noob-friendly in 40k is because it has more noobs."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,LiquidAether,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:17:40 2015 UTC,I think it ends up being what the local players are like - shame to hear in your local community the 40K-ers are not as friendly. We tend to get a lot of kids or newbies in wargaming within our local scene (due to being in a shopping center with the only 'toy shop' in there) so I guess we got used to introducing them to the game and shaped how we interact with new players I guess.
Warhammer,3cg0gq,LiquidAether,22,Thu Jul 16 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue is that GW is intent on not letting people play both.  If this had been a new game, people would be all over it.  Instead they felt they had to first destroy Warhammer.  No more books printed, so no more new players.  No updates.  And if what the guy at Warhammer World says is true, no more models will ever be supported for 8th, and the current models will not be supported in future editions of AoS.  All of this on top of simmering anger at GW for refusing to talk to their customers.  Two way communication would be great, but we don't even get 1 way communication.  If they had done even a bit of damage control leading up to this, a little ""Don't worry, here's what's on the horizon!"" they would have at least a little more goodwill toward them.  But this thing about sending people out to conventions, rather than posting info someplace everyone can get at it, is just too little, too late.  They may well be able to recover, but they're going to have to put actual effort into it for once."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Aiyon,-5,Tue Jul 7 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"By the looks of it they will be dedicating majority of the year to continue supporting the foundation of AoS as a system.  They seem to gamble alot on this so I'm pretty sure they will have put in the effort. As for the rage, no one put up any noise for the LoTR system as it quietly fell of GW radar - the community simply dismissed it as crappy or unfeasible. While sad that it is no longer supported as a system I've come to terms with it and still have a game or two now and then with old mates.  While I can agree that GW has never been great at costumer interaction, this a start if slightly awkward - but a lesson they can (and I hope they do) learn for the future to improve communication with the community. I'm pretty sure we are well aware GW is behind when it comes to the notions of interwebs and social media.   As for people getting kicked out of store ? man I really don't know where but in Australia we're pretty chill as long as you're not causing trouble so I don't know where the anti-GW store sentiment is going in this thread."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Aiyon,2,Tue Jul 7 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to people getting kicked out of the store, I'm lucky enough to have a fantastic independent retailer where we can play any game we please.  But the community can no longer grow now that it is unsupported."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Slythis,2,Tue Jul 7 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"As for the rage, no one put up any noise for the LoTR system as it quietly fell of GW radar - the community simply dismissed it as crappy or unfeasible. While sad that it is no longer supported as a system I've come to terms with it and still have a game or two now and then with old mates.   That's because of why they killed off the LOTR SBG. You can thank New Line's incredibly restrictive licensing for that. It's also why LOTR models have such fixed poses. New Line were such sticklers with the license that GW was making next to no profit off the game.  Source: Having had this conversation with multiple GW store managers while sat in Bugman's Bar."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Jonluw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:36 2015 UTC,That's interesting - I didn't know New Line had a massive hand in the game (I always assumed they allowed GW to slap on LoTR tag on it and develop whatever they want). For me LoTR died off because in my local GW at the time the staff didn't even bother to give any effort in promoting the system - so it was left to us LoTR kiddies to play and grasp by ourselves until they made it into apocalypse sized battles which were not suited to the core ruleset. The skirmish size and low entry cost is what hooked us then (other than love for LoTR) and that eventually transferred to AoS.
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Slythis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"Ooh, that's a thought, does AoS play like the SBG? Because that might just convince me to give it a go :P"
Warhammer,3cg0gq,CommissarPenguin,14,Thu Jul 16 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"I will try to explain what WHFB players are pissed in as level headed a way as I am capable of.  Over the last 5 years I have spent more time and money than I care to think about on a game I loved. I loved it because I enjoyed moving large blocks of models around. I loved it because of the established lore. I loved it because it was a more tactically complex game than 40k. Age of Sigmar killed all of that.   The most galling thing about this is that Age of Sigmar is GW throwing the Fantasy players a bone. Instead of just discontinuing the entire system and focusing on 40k, which I would have found less insulting, they hammered together a basic set of rules that will allow them to keep pushing out new models while requiring a minimum effort to support. No fluff outside of filler pages in WDs, no need to even consider trying to balance new units, no worries about aesthetic unity, just crap out a couple of new limited run models every so often and never give it a second thought.  So no, I won't chill, I won't build models and I won't roll dice."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,Skizzik_NZ,10,Tue Jul 7 19:18:14 2015 UTC,"I have basically never played, and haven't painted a model in years, yet WHFB is very close to my heart as the kind of strategy game I'd like to play with a lot of focus on building the optimal army for a situation and positioning it. I started painting around the time of the last update to Bretonnia.   What makes this extra painful is that in addition to my general fondness of the game and lore, I've been waiting for years and years for the next update of Bretonnia. Seeing all these new models come out for all the other armies, I couldn't wait to see what new things they would come up with and paint a set of whole new Bretonnians. Though I saw the signs with The end times, it still really hurts that I'll never get to see new exciting resin models of the army I have so much nostalgic love for."
Warhammer,3cg0gq,midmar,3,Tue Jul 7 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"Well I'm a little bit sad that you won't build models and roll dice anymore - wargaming is already a niche hobby.   There is fluff about End Times -> AoS, it was in the rulebook that comes with the set that I play tested in the store. I can't recall much other than how Sigmar's spirit came into the new realm along with the forces of chaos spilling forth since i was mostly focused on the rules and getting a few games in. If you get the chance please do go to your local store and read it up.   As for your point about balance and all that, personally I'm one of those people who don't like to do constant speculation and rather have a wait, see then say approach. We don't exactly know what's every deal is about with AoS until a few month of releases = /"
Warhammer,3cg0gq,biggles86,3,Wed Jul 8 02:01:37 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify; I won't be building models or rolling dice within the context of AoS. I actually played a game of Star Wars: Armada last night and had a great time.  Yes. I know there is fluff about the transition from End Times to Aos; I've read it and was not a fan.  As for balance there is no speculation. We have the rules for the game. We have the Warscrolls for existing units. There is absolutely nothing in the rules GW put out stopping me from showing up on release day with a Screaming Bell and Kairos Fateweaver and winning every single game no matter what my opponent puts on the board. The only way I could possibly lose is if someone else did the same thing; in which case it all boils down to ""Who gets to say 'I win' first?"" Why would anyone want to play this game?"

I'm lucky enough to get players who aren't running cheesy lists and we will be playing the game without being D-Bags. If you're in the assumption that everyone will be able to spell backwards for fateweaver then fine, don't play AoS and move on. If you turn up with those models and expect people to play with you again - give a think why. play star wars, armada, x-wing or dropzone commander if you enjoy it and move on with dignity.

This is a question every prospective player will ask themselves. And it is generally broken down into two categories, gameplay and narrative. It has been broken down like this in academia for many years, and good synergy between the two categories are known to make for good games. Warhammer Fantasy 8th edition had a reasonable synergy. AoS does not. Games Workshop has released a bad game while throwing away a good one. This is where the rage, hate and so on comes from. We (people who hold a similar opinion to mine) are not mad people crazily ranting away, we are the voice in the gaming culture that disapproves of these kinds of changes to game making, and we feel strongly enough to let other people know about it. I feel very strongly that gaming has begun to take a turn for the worse, and when I see people defending it I feel the need to let my opinion be known.  Let me expand on my view. To do so I will return to the previous question that I posed. Why do you play Warhammer? Like any game you play it for a core logic, puzzle solving and strategy that both challenges, provides enjoyment and achievement when I am successful in doing the right things ( gameplay). Then more uniquely to the franchise I play it for the lore, the fantasy context, the world and most importantly the feeling of COMMANDING AN ARMY(narrative). Remember what I said earlier about the two being combined and requiring a SYNERGY to be successful. It is these things that more or less draw us to the game. I have highlighted the final point as I believe it is the most fundamental to any war game player and I feel that it is also the most fundamental factor missing from the AoS release. So now we have defined why we play the game, let us compare Warhammer 8th edition with AoS using the above criteria and determine why so many people are upset with the game.  First of all let us address the lack of a point system in AoS that so many player are ""getting worked up about"". AoS does not provide any way for the game to appear FAIR on even casual level. This is a  flaw in the game play element of the game. This is because without the game being FAIR then the game is subsequently less CHALLENGING. I wish I did not have to provide an example for this as it seem obvious but I will go ahead anyway.   Jimmy and I have decided to put aside an hour for a game of AoS. We do not have time to come up with a whole back story or decided on some fair campaign we just want to play and test our wits against each other as this is generally the reason for playing a game. I felt like playing with my steam tank that day for whatever reason and Jimmy felt like running his High Elf glittering host against me. The rules allow for this so lets play( NOTE THAT I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO COME UP WITH MY OWN GAME RULES AND THIS IS WHY I AM PLAYING SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME AND NOT MY OWN). We play and as I am outnumbered I choose his weakest unit as the method for my victory. Unfortunately for him I roll lucky and get the first turn. I plow into that unit and come away with the hollow, but major victory. What a great game that was.  As you can see neither player enjoyed the game because of the lack of CHALLENGE. This is why when you release game without a way to make it fair for either player, it will more or less be unsuccessful. I will now mention why Warhammer 8th editon provided CHALLENGE. It was because GW put effort into making a point system so that players to easily play a fair game without much fuss. Sure it had its holes but it was much better than having NOTHING AT ALL. AA game that is flawed in its gameplay is barely a game at all, and I would argue that AoS IS NOT A GAME.  Secondly let us approach the lack of synergy between the gameplay and the narrative of AoS. This is something the makers of 8th edition actually did really well. Think back to what were the most important decisions you made in 8th edition while playing, DEPLOYMENY AND MOVEMENT. This is a strong mechanic as it reflects the narrative of commanding an army in reality. Deployment and movement are indeed very important and this provides a synergy between gameplay and narration. Now, let us take a look at AoS, what seems to be the most important decisions that you make? is it not who attacks first in combat?  This is such a fall in immersion, gameplay and synergy that I am disgusted even thinking about it. The fact that who chooses first is decided by a dice roll furthers this. In games we want to remove things coming down to a coin toss and enhance a players ability to express themselves within the game. THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TRUST ME. I would love to see a counter argument against that. ON top of all this the synergy is completely destroyed as it makes no sense that a general of an army could possibly control what units attack and when and then further more be fucking turn based. Surely it would come down to the physical attributes of the characters fighting. this is what 8th edition ALREADY had, and was a good rule!  Finally, the lack of complexity provided by AoS has further damaged the synergy between gameplay and narrative. It is just a more streamlined washed out version of what 8th edition was. The reduction of content seems to be somewhere in the high percentiles. It is never a good idea to reduce content. NEVER. Stream line what content you have sure, but reduce a players ability to use content... NEVER.  I am sorry to say that I do not support game making like this as in the end it is very obvious what they are. Cash cows and money grabs. The effort and care just obviously isn't there and these are the things I respect, not money and efficiency. By killing your fanbase you killed yourself, you may survive as a company by ripping off poor children mothers, but you will never be as cool as you once were. I laugh at your shame and loss of honour and remain on the look out for a proper game making company that understands the basic fundamentals of game making. Good day, Midmar"
Warhammer,3cg0gq,ImpendingFoil,3,Wed Jul 8 03:07:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for keeping the language civil and much appreciated for your points which clearly expressed for an argument. I'd like to talk about a few points you've put up (i'm guessing these past few weeks you've thought about it for your love of the hobby - which is evident).   On narrative: previously trying to justify why army fight in a narrative sense is difficult based on the Old World geography (why is my Bretonnians fighting Tomb Kings as an example). The roving warbands of Mordheim has a better narrative to give a reasoning why faction X is fighting faction Y regardless of race origin. On commanding an army I still feel right at home as the unnamed character leading his warband (like the old 40K rulebook where it says the general is your avatar). On gameplay: there is some depth that you actually have to play out here, at first glance it is very basic but after the second game I learnt a few tricks such as retreating (as units in retreat cannot be charged) which screwed over an all-melee warband as I used my own turn to move and run away before charging in my next turn when i gained initiative. Random player phase also presents tactical dillema such as the LoTR system (although I wished there was a mechanic to have heroes to pull Heroic moves by spending finite resources. etc). It feels random yes, but it simulates the flowing tides of battle as random events might happen which your forces are robbed of impetus or initiative. There are other mechanics as well such as model LoS - an argument which i see getting thrown about shooting in combat - Ally models intervene LoS so I don't know how people came about the point of locking / killing units via shooting. I've played with random people thus far and everyone had a positive opinion of the game and fun - which led to us cementing a group for local AoS plays. Further rules will undoubtedly be rolled out by GW to help us get a better grip with the system; they may be incompetent - but they are far from stupid. I personally prefer to spend my time playing and learning the new system rather than speculating, when those update comes my opinion might change for the better or worse; but i'll wait until then. On balance: Yes GW easily made a mistake by not having a definitive cap on army sizes on release, it is certainly vague to not have a limit or more ways to calculate sudden death other than model count. Currently our local meta have decided on the simple rule of 5 warscolls maximum, with no hero duplicates and counting wounds rather than models for the purposes of sudden death. It forced us to do one thing - communicate with each other - in order to create what everyone is happy and civil with. I don't know what it's like in your country / local GW scene, but in Australia we seemed to easily get along just fine.  On activation: This is what alot of people seem to say the loudest the most and get wrong during play, alternating player combat allows decision making to pick what unit can affect the game the most. units locked in combat, remaining wounds all play apart in unit activation now which plays heavily into this 'gambit' effect AoS gameplay i've experienced thus far which has resulted in both victories and defeats in my games. As much as we all love the notion of CONSISTENCY, the game is still determined by chance. This can be mitigated by unit boosting synergies such as my Brett lord which gives re-rollable charge distances, Paladin who give 'unbreakable' equivalent bubble should he last hit enemy monster or hero (yes I softened up a monster by activating another unit first and luckily enough it was 1 wound away for my paladin to get a good chance to unlock his buff). AoS plays alot of chance but chances that AFFECT your game in a significant manner. again it simulates the randomness of battle as nothing is ever set in stone in life or games. my general failed a 3"" charge by rolling snake eyes and proceeded to get a beat down but that's just the dice gods and I move on. On challenge: AoS as a sytem likes you to gamble - gone are the days of large mosters such as war hydras and dragons insta-kill poor blocks of spearmen. there are unit counters to unit types (bonus damage / accuracy / rend) which can destroy a list with just those unit types. Bringing all dragons / monsters have an internal balancing which lessens their combat effectiveness once they take too many wounds (which simulates the effect of damage really well) and also gives lowly infantry models the chance to kill things these days rather than be an effective speed bump. Every model in AoS has a high kill potential when played or buffed right - that is determined on what you want to play without cheesing and instead thinking about why take unit X over unit Y (as an example Phoenix guard over swordmasters etc) along with supporting units that synergises with the unit you pick and affect your warband as a whole.  On Business: I don't see GW toppling down anytime soon and even if it does the world will revolve another day and there are other systems to play (malifaux / pike& shotte comes to mind) and all systems have inherrent imbalances and power creeps - it is the nature of living game rules and systems (anyone who plays League, HoTS or DoTA will understand me here). GW made the gamble on what they think is best to compete with the current crop of wargames in the market and I think they are a step in the right direction in following privateer press approach to give free rules and constant unit updates. Perhaps GW is currently undergoing a new generation of internal changes and strategies. As a wargamer and person I don't like to force anyone into the hobby - I always prefer people to sit down play the system a few times with an open mind then decide upon whether you want to invest your time and money into this.  Personal opinion: As a long time 40K player this is the first time I've genuinely wanted to play alot of games - simply because the type of players are more relaxed and focused on having fun with different lists as well as the fantasy warband theme and flavours. AoS presented an alternative system for me when I do not feel like the (imaginary) roars of bolter and chainsword. While it is sad to see / hear many players about supposedly selling or dropping out of WFB, I still think it's a right step for GW to introduce players to the hobby. Change never sits well with anyone, but change is necessary for any individual and business to be better at something.    Again thanks for keeping it civil and happy wargaming midmar"
Warhammer,3cg0gq,sparklethong,4,Wed Jul 8 04:20:23 2015 UTC,"I know my hate comes from how it would have been so easy for this to just be an ""extra"" thing that they do, something like Mordheim of old, that was in addition to the mass battle system and worked as a foothold into the larger system to draw in new blood. not replace the system entirely.  2nd point of contention: round bases.  I like most of the new models (barring that weird facemask on the sigmarines) and would love to get the set (well, I go back and fourth on this daily the last few days) but those round bases are going to clash with the look of all my current armies.  how hard would it have been to keep the same old look to make me (and most) happy? especially since they are only there to hold up the model.  (then i could also get going n some backwards compatiability with 8th as a whole new army all i would need to do is....)  point 3:  point costs.  I have seen 3 reports so far on youtube.  (ogres vs mortal chaos) that looked uneven since the chaos player was just dumping models on the table(literally) while the ogre player just used the normal army he used in 8th.  Ogres swept the board (did not even need the sudden death objective)  Ogres are OP.  2nd game was Undead vs high elves,   tons of special character cheese from the undead player vs a medium sized list for the high elves (a bit bigger then what i think the ""normal"" Aos game should be btw)  elves lost before their 2nd turn, they were somehow outnumbering the force that was 4x their points in the old edition.  sudden death needs to be based on something other then models.  game 3: High elves Vs Dwarves.  pretty small game to test the rules, looked ok, high elves had a special character though, and he just wrecked face without something to stop him.  also, swordmasters have a 4+ save while dwarf warriors have a 5+?  what?!  it was a massacre for the elves.  as you might have noticed, point 4 would be the dumb sounding names/spellings for the armies.   steamhead...I cant even finish typing it   eechhk.

There is something stopping us from recruiting new players however, they don't fucking publish the books anymore.

Like Orcs? those are going away, enjoy your new Orruk(©®™☹) models.    GW have talked to have updates in the future for tournament scene - so instead of getting angry and spouting negativity towards (and unnecessarily driving away) anyone who wanted to be part of an already niche hobby, just sit down, play a game or two of the new system and wait.   They have confirmed they won't be adding points or any other balancing factor. I, and many others don't have time to figure out a balancing factor before each game I play. Joe might think the new Sigmarines (©®™♞☂) are overpowered, and Jim might think that his Bloodsecrator (©®™☭) is way better than it is. Compared to walking to my group and saying 'who is up for 500 warbands?' or '2400 anyone?' it's a MASSIVE pain in the ass, and for new players, it's VERY difficult to learn to balance everything.   Edit-  lastly, the new fluff and rules are retarded, and wildly oversimplified. Fucking shoot into melee all you want man.

We rolled into the GW store that opening weekend to play our game outside of our kitchen tables only to be told that we could not play that game in store. When we questioned why we couldn't play a GW game in a GW store we were told it was a product line they were not supporting. When we questioned that statement we were told we could leave if we were not going to play a different and currently supported game. This was when they were still selling Necromunda miniatures on their website and around the time they uploaded the rules to their site for free. We were quite baffled and I do not think any of us have played at that location since then about 10 years ago.  I still buy paint there if I need it and the occasional White Dwarf but tend to buy anything else from independent stores. The employees from them are also long gone now but that initial impression kind of soured me on the place.

So I guess this would make me an investor in GW by your definitions.  As for the points / system balancing why not just you know - wait ? So far it's based on what the internet has around, so to argue at the total accuracy is an exercise in futility at best - so like i said wait for a few months. balancing wise my local meta agreed to run 5 warscroll max so that is pretty simple.

Things like pretending to ride a horse, comparing moustaches, bringing a handheld mirror, literally bribing your opponent... all of this stuff is just so silly. It's not something I've come to expect of GW, and it is extremely jarring.  Don't get me wrong, I can understand that Fantasy didn't sell as well, and it was a more complex game that made it difficult to bring in newcomers - but it was what it was, y'know? It had it's own soul and personality. The End Times really brought about a new spike of interest in the setting and people were insanely hyped about Fantasy for a while! And then GW suddenly came about and said that all the hype they had built up was the precursor to eliminating Fantasy entirely. I simply cannot understand how that's a wise decision in any sense."

But I decided to go against it due to being highly tiring quickly in terms of theatrics. You can simply choose to use the joke rules or not. there's nothing stopping you from fielding models with the odd rules which are still effective in their own terms.   Proper list build list synergy is strong without the need of joke rules - eg Slaneesh lord on daemonsteed command ability to buff say a unit of slaaneshi knight to allow them to pile in and attack twice in one combat phase."

As for the negative stigmas I grew up not caring what others think of me and my passions - and it seems to be running fine for me so far. I have friends who share great times with the hobby as well as other nerdy things and met a range of interesting people (family men, career professionals) thanks to wargaming. At the end of the day everyone is connected by the hobby and personally to me nothing else matters (maybe it comes with age).   Remember a few bad apples give bad impressions like anything else in life and it's easy to get brought down to their level - and be beaten by their experience. The only way I counter the bad image of a tabletop nerd is by being civil and open minded (along with personal grooming and dress sense - VERY IMPORTANT). Other than that just make practical life choices like eating and exercising well along with being friendly, and from my experience helps make it a hobby just like any other activity.  Chin up buddy and happy wargaming !"
Warhammer,3cas1z,gwarsh41,3,Mon Jul 6 13:18:52 2015 UTC,The purple looks really great. I love the colour scheme. It does start a bit abruptly though.

Warhammer,3cas1z,perfectriot,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:00 2015 UTC,I see that. It's mainly the second tentacle from the bottom that looks as if it suddenly turns purple from the green teeth. It really looks nasty in a Nurgle way.

Warhammer,3cas1z,Zel1988,2,Mon Jul 6 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"It's looking greay, but I think there's 2 things you want to do: use nuln oil/purple wash to darken the tentacles closer to his gut(rot). And I think you need to bring in some more purple or other color elsewhere on the model. besides the purple it blends into a nurgley mess in a.... moderately good way.   You already have the rust down so you could bring on something contrasting and stipple it onto the armor so you basically get an instant rust effect with whatever spots you don't cover. Suggestions: teal/turquoise, red, ochre"

I wish I had the time and money to paint an army like this. Personally, I'm not 100% keen on the purple ropes, they look too red. Maybe a bit lighter might make them stand out a bit more.

Mephiston red needs to be milky, for the first step and a bit more diluted on the end steps."

As for the things to improve on:   More even layers of paint (armor), there are parts which would need another thin coat of metal paint.  Try to keep within the boundaries of elements – also with washes.  When you use washes try to use them with a bit of Lahmian Medium.

Warhammer,3cadzh,mrpinkiller,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"Looks dope, but somewhat unfinished.   Assuming that you painted balthasar gold on the golden parts, paint it over with shining gold, wash it with agrax, re-highlight the raised areas with shining gold and then pick out the finest edges and paint them with runefang steel. It will give it a great gold look. You can go a step further with gold and instead of re-highlighting with shining gold you can do it with auric gold for an even more shiny gold look. I do it that way but it's preference. So. Balthasar gold -> Shining gold -> Agrax earthshade -> Shining gold -> Fine silverfang runesteel highlight. Or substitute the second shining gold with auric gold. The shaft of the hammer could use a color, take screamer pink, shade it with nuln oil and then re-highlight with screamer pink horror or the new version of scab red ( Still have the old one). Take a very fine brush and try to make some squiggly lines on the parchment with black. and the fine edges could be highlighted with pallid wych flesh."

Warhammer,3cadzh,Spiraticus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:39:26 2015 UTC,High light on the bronze and silver eras would really help bring out the details Take a fine brush and clean up the areas were the bronze went onto the silver Go fill in some details on the weapons.   Great job overall!
Warhammer,3cadzh,Spiraticus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"Great model, very nice job on the silver. I personally HATE Ghenna's Gold. It looks too coppery. Us Grey Knights need to be THE GOLDENBOYS on the battlefield. That is, assuming you used Ghenna's. I'm a personal advocate for P3's Rhulic Gold. Here are my terminators with Rhulic Gold on them. My only advice towards actually painting is working on staying in the lines on the words. Try to use the side of the brush to ""lay"" the paint on the words rather than trying to write them with the tip. Also, as much as I would love it if we could, GK's can't use Storm Shields. We'd be absolutely ridiculous with 2+/2++ due to Sanctuary + Storm Shield."

Doubling your wounds will always make you twice as hard to kill, whereas the 4+ save only makes you twice as hard to kill against weapons without rending.  Also, I think you need to discount horde models over powerful individuals. Even Underdog status aside (which is a stupid crutch rule), it's much harder to bring 100 goblins to bear then it is to bring 10 Sigmarines to bear. Ease/ability for spacial concentration of force is a key aspect of some armies' strengths. It's the reason terminators cost more than 2 tactical marines, even though their save is only twice as effective.  What is the value of these discounts? That's hard to say, and really that's the whole reason we need point values from a central source. Players will disagree how much an extra point of armor is worth, whereas nobody will disagree about what the Army Book says."
Warhammer,3caogt,TheStinkfoot,2,Mon Jul 6 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"This.   I've just finished doing points for Lizardmen and OnG using an arbitrary points system, where I just assigned an arbitrary value to the first unit (~10 for saurus over 20), and comparing mathematical average combat total wounds dealt vs starting wounds after battle-shock, and it was surprising how many of the units actually came out close to their current costs comparing their relative effectiveness. Goblins, Basic Orcs, Saurus, Orc Cav, etc, came out very close to what they are currently at when you compare them relative to each other, based on wound count/Save/Average damage Caused/etc. That said, units like Black Orcs and Temple Guard became significantly better, being worth something closer to ~20 points, while most heroes are around the old basic hero points level of ~50-100 points (Command abilities vary drastically in strength, so some are worth ~50 points, while others are only worth ~10-15), while most monsters (Incl. Monstrous/monster riding heroes) dropped in value to something closer to between ~100-175.  For units with bonuses for being 20+/30+ models, the models over those threshholds should have an increase in points cost as well, because they become drastically better.  For Example, if you value basic orcs at 5 points, 7 for models over 20 (+1 for shields or add. hand weapons), and Saurus at ~9 points, 10/12 for models over 20/30, they are very close in terms of performance relative to each other. With the in-built +1 Bravery/10 models in the unit, the battleshock being more problematic for bigger units is already covered (for the most part).  Bravery needs to be taken into account, as it is relevant, through much more so for horde units like Goblins than for elite/multi-wound units. An additional wound almost doubles the worth of a model, because of how battleshock is affected by it. Something like 1/2 point per bravery when doing a linear system would be right.  A strictly mathematical formula won't catch relative unit effectiveness well enough. LoTR managed it, but that's a different beast altogether, and the value of stats changed significantly based on the number of wounds and whether or not the model was a hero (for Courage).  Wound count is worth a ton in AoS, so you almost have to just multiply the value the model would otherwise have by the wound count to get a reasonable value.  Summoning will need to be modified in some way after assigning points values, or be used as a reserve mechanic."
Warhammer,3caogt,Asamu,3,Tue Jul 7 05:30:06 2015 UTC,Have you written down your approach anywhere? I've got some ideas for some general rules for assigning points based on a series of general rules about wounds and probabilities to remove wounds from other people (giving a whole new meaning to mathhammering) so that when new warscrolls come out it should be easy to apply those rules and get (in 99% of cases) a reasonably internally consistent points value and it would be nice to compare notes.
Warhammer,3caogt,drakeAndrews,4,Mon Jul 6 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"It's in the top row. (8-save) x wounds + ((7-tohit) x (7-towound) x (1-(.5 x rend if rend !=0)) x (range/12 if range > 12) x damage)/6 + ((movement-4) x 2 if flying). Base value of a mortal wound is 36 modified based on the chance of it happening. Casting costs 30 + however much I think the mages custom spell is worth. I need to add something for bravery, I'm thinking multiply the total by (1+.1 x bravery)/2. I also pointed by individual special rule, though any based on having a larger sized or synergy with another unit I did not give point values, most that involve dice rolling I tried to do mathematically, others I tried my best for just an appropriate value, though this was harder on the small models like men at arms and the like without making each model way to expensive."
Warhammer,3caogt,drakeAndrews,3,Mon Jul 6 16:42:26 2015 UTC,It was magic and abilities I was wondering about. I'm hoping to have my dataset trained tonight so I might start with the armies you've got points for and we can see how much we agree/disagree.
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,2,Mon Jul 6 16:52:10 2015 UTC,Is there a reason that the old points system wouldn't work for this?
Warhammer,3caogt,Creationstudios,3,Mon Jul 6 13:54:23 2015 UTC,Units have changed stats and rules. I personally don't believe in assigning points this early. The game just came out! Can we try balancing it with warscrolls first and go from there.
Warhammer,3caogt,Darkreaper48,8,Mon Jul 6 14:40:08 2015 UTC,"We have.  Lets each take 4 warscrolls.  You're new to the hobby so you take 2 squads of high elf spearmen, about 20 in number, a lord on griffin, and 15 archers.  I've been playing for forever. I take nagash, 200 skeletons, 300 zombies, and who the fuck cares what else because you see my point.  The balance is not existent, not with 'balanced based on wounds', not with 'take same number of warscrolls'.  There is nothing you can find, aside from gentlemen's agreements (i.e. these two battleforces are approximately the same power level, lets play just with those), or points to balance the game."
Warhammer,3caogt,Creationstudios,-5,Mon Jul 6 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"You could balance by being a good person... When y they're taking units of 20, you also take units of 20. We don't need to be doing a ton of math to make this game work, just use the honor system, maybe these points will work for tournament's, except it isn't necessary for s friendly game."
Warhammer,3caogt,Darkreaper48,5,Mon Jul 6 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"So 20 Spearmen are worth 20 zombies?  Are 20 Phoenix Guard worth 20 zombies?  Obviously not. A zombie is probably worth 5/6 to 2/3 of what a spearman is, and less than half what a phoenix guard is.    That's why I included the ""gentleman's agreement"" clause. You can arbitrarily say. Okay, well, 50 zombies, a necromancer, and 10 skeletons are roughly fair versus a bolt thrower, two squads of 20 sea guard and a standard prince. But who's to say that's fair? imo, I'd give the battle to the sea guard and high elves.  You don't need points values to play the game, but they are beneficial, not just so that you're protected against people who would deceptively offer to play then outnumber you - but also so that you don't have to worry about being an accidental dick.  My first game we tried the wounds system. A bolt thrower with 2 crew is 'worth' 6 wounds. It dealt 6 wounds + in damage every turn.  If there were point values to this game, one would KNOW that the bolt thrower is worth x amount of infantry.  And the more diverse and large the army, the harder it is to roughly look piece by piece and make sure they are equivilent."
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,-4,Mon Jul 6 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"Balancing unequal forces isn't really necessary as long as victory conditions provide a handicap to inferior forces. The sudden death rule is an attempt to make this happen, but it's a little too ham-handed. If, for instance, you made the victory condition for the Elf (Aelf?) army solely that they had to inflict 1.5X as many wounds as they began the game with (~80 wounds) that seems reasonable and doesn't actually need points values."
Warhammer,3caogt,Darkreaper48,7,Mon Jul 6 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"But then you're just adding your own rules.  And what's different between you adding in your own arbitrary rules, and someone assigning point values to the game in order to balance out two armies.  And trying to inflict 80 wounds in this case is a bit unreasonable since you will get wiped long before you can being outnumbered over 5-1"
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,0,Mon Jul 6 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"But then you're just adding your own rules.   I think that's what GW's going for.   And sure, it is arbitrary. But this way you can play ""balanced"" games with however many models each person wants to bring while still having a way for the underdog to actually win."
Warhammer,3caogt,Real_life_in_Canada,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:41 2015 UTC,If we're adding our own rules what's wrong with adding a points system?
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:44:47 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with it. But it's unnecessary when a reasonably well-balanced point system already exists.
Warhammer,3caogt,Real_life_in_Canada,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:10:44 2015 UTC,What's that? Scrolls? Wfb points cost?
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, WFB points"
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,0,Wed Jul 8 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"Units have changed stats and rules   I'm aware, but I think the old points are going to be a better approximation than anything that can be out there after a weekend of play."
Warhammer,3caogt,ChicagoCowboy,3,Mon Jul 6 15:31:20 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree - my 2400 points of lizardmen, using the old points but the new rules, should be balanced with 2400 of something else using the old points but the new rules, at least in theory."
Warhammer,3caogt,ChicagoCowboy,2,Mon Jul 6 17:03:24 2015 UTC,That's not even necessarily true between different editions of the same army book let alone across a huge edition change like this.
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,4,Mon Jul 6 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"Of course its not true between different editions of the same army book, that's the point of army book updates. But using the latest edition of each race's army books, obviously taking special consideration for Brets and Skaven who haven't been updated since 7th or 6th, should yield roughly balanced forces; why wouldn't they?   GW clearly applied a basic logic to the warscrolls when creating them - they didn't just blindly pick stats. There is a common theme between characters, monsters, infantry, weak infantry, chariots, cavalry, and war machines if you've read all the war scrolls. They're all very similar within each vein, with flavored special rules or equipment to make them unique."
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that GW took the existing stats and special rules and applied a straightforward conversion system (e.g., every BS 3 model hits on a 5+ now, etc.), which means the old points system is most appropriate."
Warhammer,3caogt,MrScratch,2,Mon Jul 6 17:38:04 2015 UTC,You know what they say when you assume. Small guys like skaven slaves and skinks are significantly better in this version because they can wound even the toughest monsters.
Warhammer,3caogt,ChicagoCowboy,2,Mon Jul 6 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"That's right, but unless you like HeroHammer, that's a good thing."
Warhammer,3caogt,ChicagoCowboy,2,Mon Jul 6 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. From the trends of what I've done so far choosing powerful hero's over base troops won't be overpowered like it has been in some editions, it will just be a matter of preference wether you want a small number of elite models or a horde. Of course my calculations assume you get rid of the sudden victory crap."
Warhammer,3caogt,ChicagoCowboy,2,Mon Jul 6 18:04:50 2015 UTC,"From my view, the relative points value of the rank and file troops are still totally valid. e.g., Skaven slaves/skinks/Brettonian knights all preform about the same relative to one another. Leaving the points values intact shouldn't make that much of a difference.  Characters, however, are weaker, because a barrage of bow shots will take down characters who literally couldn't be harmed by S3 in the previous editions. Sure, this means that now those same characters are ""overcosted"" relative to the old system - but these characters were WAY overpowered back then. If you make the characters as being less points-efficient, you disincentivize HeroHammer, which IMO is always a good thing."
Warhammer,3caogt,OzMazza,3,Mon Jul 6 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"Plus, if you take into account that the options/upgrades available to each character/unit doesn't cost anything...you can take say a Chaos Sorcerer Lord for 235 points, and just leave him at his base cost. Upgrade him however you want from the AoS scroll, and take him to battle. Probably still over costed for their now weakened roll in the battle, but a decent approximation at least."

Warhammer,3caogt,GunnarHamundarson,2,Tue Jul 7 00:13:25 2015 UTC,this seems somewhat hasty given the rules have only been out for a few days. I feel it also doesn't take into account certain mechanical interactions and stuff like diminishing returns on larger units from battleshock etc.

Warhammer,3caogt,kroxigor01,4,Mon Jul 6 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"The Bretonnians have an ability that activates when you call 'FOR THE LADY'. Also, the Skaven Warscrolls dictates that you win automatically if you roll a 13 on 2d6 when using the Screaming Bell.  It's mostly for humor/flavor."
Warhammer,3caogt,ReaperOfCaliban,3,Mon Jul 6 15:22:52 2015 UTC,I think the rules for Marius (Empire) are my favorite. Pretend to ride a horse? Get extra saves. TALK to said imaginary horse? Extra attack (I think).

Warhammer,3caogt,ReaperOfCaliban,3,Mon Jul 6 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"WAAC is a bullshit term that exists almost entirely in Games Workshop games because the rules are shit and the balance is garbage.  I can take a very powerful army with a good theme to it and be accused of being WAAC because I did not choose the obvious trash entries in the army book while my opponent did.   Additionally, you literally can not win against someone who calls you WAAC.  These people either claim moral victory because my army steamrolls the dumb shit they put on the table so I only won due to being a WAAC powergaming asshole that only plays OP stuff or they pull out a win and that proves what an amazing general they are and how a true gamer is actually better than everyone else.      Now, games with actual balance and good rules might have units, models, or builds that are at the top of the power curve but that curve is is not so bad that the other player is at a strong disadvantage or feels the need to call the other player a WAAC douche for playing what they want."
