Russia had its present day flag back then (pre USSR and all) and the flag Canada has was started in 1868. Russia fought in the Crimean War and fought against Britain, Sardinia (which did practically nothing), the Ottomans, and France. They lost badly, and were scared the British would capture Alaska, so they sold it to the U.S., back when they were close allies.

In 1820, Congress came up with the Missouri Compromise, devised by Henry Clay of Kentucky. Slavery would be legal in Missouri, but not in any other territory as far north as Missouri. And also, Maine, until then an unconnected part of Massachusetts, became its own state, so the number of slave states and free states would remain equal.

stateball,3d6zyz,Stellafera,5,Tue Jul 14 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"I understand, it's only your 5th largest city. Not big in the grand scheme of things.  In fact, its population is quite a bit smaller than the the estimated San Diego Comic Con attendance last year (a little over 130,000 people compared to 48,611 residents in Roswell). But that's reasonable, I mean, we've all heard how big of a deal the international Comic Con is. I've heard that hotels in San Diego get an absurd amount of business around the time of the convention for good or ill. Big impact.   But New Mexico can do bigger and better! Yes, much bigger than some rinky dink little convention in Southern California. The Albuquerque Balloon Festival is magnificent. Just look at this report for their 2014 attendance:   Balloon Fiesta’s estimated attendance was 848,393 visits. The number is down slightly from 2013’s estimated 883,685.   Now you may wonder why I'm bringing this up. I went to the balloon museum in the off season and it was very nice, but that's got nothing to do with this.   You see, the population of Albuquerque is actually not that much bigger in comparison to the attendance. Actually, to specify, it's smaller. Actually, to really specify, there are exactly 291,898 less people who live in your state's most populous city than people who watch hot air balloons there for a week in October.  If that's not ridiculous, I don't know what is."

Contextual healing: In 1848, America stole obtained the New Mexico Territory from Mexico. In 1861, the Confederacy claimed the bottom half, calling it the Arizona Territory, and sent troops there. In 1863, the Union redrew the border to how it is today (vertical) and kicked out the Confederates during the Civil War.  Nowadays, New Mexico is a blue state, while Arizona has become infamous for outdoing Texas and Florida in red-state awfulness and general batshittery, respectively. The ""abortion reversal"" thing is a reference to a recent Arizona law that forces doctors to lie to patients and tell them that medication abortions are reversible (they aren’t). The law hasn’t gone into effect yet, because it’s tied up in the court system, due to being flagrantly unconstitutional."

stateball,3d6zyz,jdcnosse,2,Tue Jul 14 08:40:47 2015 UTC,"Only thing I can think of is that they're telling people the decision is reversible until You take the pills unless there's a timeframe after you take them that you could theoretically pump your stomach and not have the abortion.  Otherwise the law is a complete dumb waste of time and money.  Besides, any decent place you get the abortion from will have signs and will consistently tell the patient that they can change their mind all the way up to the time the take the pills (or are on the operating table if they elect the surgery version).

stateball,3d6zyz,rainbowrooooad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"For a medication abortion, you have to take two different pills. These guys are claiming that if you take the first pill, then change your mind and take a big dose of progesterone, you can save the fetus. What they don't mention is that the first pill isn't 100% effective at aborting, which is why you're supposed to take the second pill as well. It's not ""reversal"" so much as ""you fucked up your abortion.""  And I hope your gf's sister is doing okay."

Gosh ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  This comic is just one of many in the long line of shitty incoherent comics written by a local about their own state or province in order to get more attention for themselves, with some lousy current-events jokes thrown in for maximum karma. Why not sit back and I'll explain everything.  All you actually need to know - Alberta is Canada's most conservative province which isn't saying much  Bill 10 - gay-straight alliance clubs have to be allowed in all schools, especially religious ones. This was first introduced by a Liberal MP but the other three parties also ended up supporting the bill, because election time was coming and the two conservative parties didn't want to lose all their appeal in the cities. (It didn't help)  and of course gay stuff is legal throughout all of Canada.  Redmonton - the capital city is full of liberals and has been continually shafted for the last 80 years, during which Calgary-based conservative governments have been in power. Until now >:) anyway, it's just like Austin except I've heard that Austin is cultured.  This is the photo being referenced and in the background is West Edmonton Mall, which you won't recognize from the outside because it's an ugly piece of shit.  Independence - Texans are always mumbling about some secret piece of the constitution or something that allows Texas and only Texas to declare independence. Any province could leave Canada if it got the support through a referendum, and after Quebec, Alberta is the most secession-minded province.  Common Desires - There are other commonalities - specifically, we like trucks and beef. This is good enough for me."

Thanks to /u/northguineahills for vetting some of my West Virginia characterization. For the non-Americans browsing this subreddit, West Virginia is stereotyped as a poor, backwoods mining state full of incest due to its geographic isolation.     Context:  The extraordinarily popular Hunger Games book series centers around Katniss, who lives in coal-mining District 12 over in the Appalachian Mountains. And what state is the only one entirely located within the Appalachian Mountains and mines a lot of coal? West Virginia, of course! The tyrannical Capitol is in the Rockies. Hmpth.  PA = Production Assistant, which is a job on film sets. It's also Pennsylvania's postal code.  The ""My nayme is West Virginia. Ahm 152 years old..."" speech is a play on this moderately spoilery speech from Mockingjay:  ""My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My home is District 12. There is no District 12. I am the Mockingjay. I brought down the Capitol. President Snow hates me. He killed my sister. Now I will kill him. And then the Hunger Games will be over....""  ""The Boy Who Was Fired"" puns on the phrase ""The Girl Who Was on Fire"", a repeated motif in the actual Hunger Games series.  North Carolina was the filming location for the Hunger Games movie, hence West Virginia's comment that they got him as a replacement."

Anyways sorry for the massive delay, last week was the last week of school and finals week as well. Then after I did all that I was doing Summer things like playing the mass amount of games I got during the Steam Summer Sale. Then I said to myself ""haha oh shit I forgot this existed"", but I had already done Panel 1 before so I just finished up Panel 2 last night and here we are.  Enough about me tho, the context of the comic is that there's many here in the state who don't mind vaccines and get them when sick (like me), and then there are ones who are against vaccines because they claim it gives their children autism. I don't even know either. Originally the comic was supposed to be about the cultural differences in Northern and Southern California, but I'll save that concept for another state.  Finally, after the success of this series, I feel like putting it on r/polandball, but with countries instead of states of course, just want to know if the mods won't mind it and see if they like it."

Now with correct coloring on Maryland's lower left quadrant, and the right abbreviation in the title! Hooray!

California is a hotbed of anti-vaccination idiocy, which led to an outbreak of measles at Disneyland last year.

stateball,39qagn,Guppyscum,13,Sat Jun 13 19:47:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, we're proud to be American, but we ain't no damn yanks, and we'll never join that God-forsaken comblock 2.0! Remove dinner, supper best name!  It's interesting, though. We love being American, but we love being Southern; we have two identities, in a sense. We just don't want our culture and way of life stepped on and changed by the North/California."
stateball,39qagn,BigE1943,6,Tue Jun 16 04:17:08 2015 UTC,"Eh, a lot of regions are like that. I just wish we could appreciate it without turning into rascist fucks."
stateball,39qagn,KotaFluer,7,Sat Jun 20 04:25:09 2015 UTC,"That's what's unfortunate about our sectionalistic pride. The only time we existed as a sort of cultural union was in the defense of a practice that was immoral. Everyone looks to slavery as the end-all cause of the war, but in a lot of ways, it was a long time coming. The south had a totally different way of life from the north, and unfortunately, it did involve slavery. However, making the North believe every southern man owned a dozen slaves and beat them and worked them to death was not the way to solve that problem (Thanks Uncle Tom's Cabin). If they would have passed a law that abolished the practice the south would have utterly collapsed, its economy completely destroyed by the sudden and violent restructuring of the socio-economic system. And it's not like the rest of the world weren't racist fucks at this point in time; the Scramble for Africa was about to start, and even if other countries had abolished slavery, there was still a huge labor pool of Africans or Indians that basically did all their work for very little pay. And let's not forget how immigrants to the yank states and California were treated almost the same as slaves.  The civil war was the unholy child of dissatisfaction with the federal government's choice in spending money for development (To hell with the south, dump all the money into developing the west!), the south's lack of representation versus the north, opposing views on the role of said government (state's rights vs stronk federal government), cultural differences, poorly-timed waves of activism, and a general failure of both sides to ease the tension. If time had run its course and both us and the north would have been more cooperative, the war wouldn't have happened, and the social issues would have been resolved with time.  But yeah, we can't display our pride as southerners without being labeled racist fucks, because the south lost the war and the north got to write the history books. Like the north weren't racist fucks against blacks and immigrants anyway; that was just the times, bad though they were. It also doesn't help that some of the people who display their pride anyway ARE racist fucks...  And fucking Booth killing Lincoln. God damn it. He fucked us all with that one. Lincoln was gonna let us off pretty easy, but nooooooo...  /end_rant"

Just say the word ""immigration"" around her. Disorganized thoughts, too. ""I've never seen snow in my life - Flagstaff got only three feet of slow last winter, what a drag!"".  Some negative symptoms as well. We know and love her as the gonzo gun-toting Florida of the Southwest, but back in her frontier days her friends knew her as a plucky, rough and tumble little vaquera.

I couldn't resist)  Inspired by this comment string, I decided to become (I think? search reveals nothing) the first person to tackle Maryland's insane flag.  Context: US postal codes! Maryland is MD, which can also stand for Medical Doctor. Pennsylvania is PA, which can also stand for Public Accountant (though CPA is more common, hence his defensiveness about not being certified). Alabama refuses a prescription of federal funds; the state government often refuses federal help, having recently rejected a Medicaid expansion because 'oh no obummercare!' (To be fair this was done by 26 states; I chose AL because it has the simplest flag ever and with Pennsylvania and Maryland in a comic, that's what you want from the third character).  Weirdly, the thing I'm most proud of in this comic is the anatomy poster (though I think the two Marylands I managed to draw before my hand fell off are pretty good too)."

Context: At Florida's Disney World, a popular international vacation site, there's a park called EPCOT. And more than half of that park is taken up by World Showcase, a collection of country-based areas that make no real sense from a geographical or cultural perspective (but serve some fantastic food). What would this look like in Polandball? It would look like Florida putting on a crude, nonsensical puppet show, of course!  I may have gone a little too local-interest for non-Floridians this time, since I doubt many non-locals know off the tops of their heads that, for example, Morocco is the only African country represented in the World Showcase, or that Norway's old flume ride the Maelstrom is currently being replaced by a ride based on Disney's Frozen.

Fun fact, the Great Lakes contain 21% of the world's surface fresh water (not including ice), while lake Bikal in Russia (around the same size as Superior but way way deeper) contains 22% and the African great lakes contain 28%.   Another interesting note, while the Great Lakes are 21% the world's surface fresh water, they are still only 84% of North America's and, as a whole the other countries in North America (i.e. not the US and Canada, including central America and the Carribean) have less than 2% of North America's Surface water.   Seriously, 98+% of North America's Surface fresh water, all the Lakes, ponds, Marshes and rivers are in the US and Canada.

It's just that sea is usually straighter than rail, thus less distance involved.  It only cost around .03-.05 cents to transport 1 ton of freight 1 mile. The rail lines between lake Superior and California are around 1,700 miles long, meaning that every ton of water shipped would be around 50-80 cents depending on what kind of a discount you could get for bulk shipping."

New York tends to be a vacuum for money for people who don't know what they're doing, but local knowledge can make it cheaper than your Small Town America.   Case in point the picture featured in the comic can be had for free if you take the Staten Island ferry (free, plus the subway swipe to get down to south ferry for 2.75).

stateball,37sv3r,Archive_of_Madness,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:15:13 2015 UTC,"Kentucky had a nominal confederate government. They barely raised any taxes, and their army lasted all of 2 months. They were quickly ran out of the state. The actual government of Kentucky never seceded, but did try to stay neutral, until they were forced otherwise with the invasion of Kentucky in 1863. Note I said invasion, because that's what the confederacy called it, because they did not control it."

stateball,37sv3r,dwwojcik,2,Sat May 30 19:57:06 2015 UTC,"Well, it was a weird situation.  There was a significant amount of the population that supported the Confederacy, but the government did not vote to secede. Perhaps it was the army that was stationed in Kentucky, or the also significant part of the population that did not want to secede. Similar things happened in Maryland and Missouri, except that the state legislature was imprisoned so that they couldn't vote to secede."

stateball,37d819,cyanidepancakes,11,Tue May 26 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"It's more complicated than that. Michigan Territory and the Army Engineers drew the MI Territory border to include Toledo, but Ohio bankrolled a survey that drew it as Ohio-controlled. Ohio was a state first and therefore had political influence, and so when Michigan declared itself a state illegally and elected a government illegally (because we technically should have became a state years earlier, but the government kept delaying the population census necessary to prove we had the necessary population and then it was delayed to find a slave state to add join in with us) and gave Jackson and his crony Territorial government the finger (and many heapings of manure), Jackson obviously wasn't impressed and sided with Ohio for the reasons above and that he wanted their votes for re-election. Toledo at the time was also an Ohio-partisan majority, which didn't help. In the end, the federal gov't gave Michigan a choice: accept Toledo as Ohio territory through a convention (and gain the U.P. for the trouble), or remain a territory without representation. Michigan called a convention and the convention rejected the deal, but not wanting to remain a territory forever, a second convention was called and they reluctantly agreed with it.  But yea we totally had the right of way but got screwed out of it because political BS."

stateball,363pyd,mego-pie,18,Sat May 16 09:50:56 2015 UTC,Recently I read an article in the Chicago Tribune about The Great Lakes Compact which is related to this. It's about keeping Great Lakes Water in the Great Lakes Basin. Also Illinois and Wisconsin's lines are about how Illinois thinks he's above the agreement.   tl;dr The Great Lakes states are too selfish to help places with drought.  Also thanks to /u/White_Null for a bit of information about what's happening in California.   Bonus Panel What Quebec said was interesting.
stateball,363pyd,mego-pie,31,Fri May 15 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"The Great Lakes states are too selfish to help places with drought   Why should the Great Lakes do more to solve California's problems than California is willing to do?  California is using most of their water on agriculture, most of which is exported.  They haven't made any effort to control the growth of their own population, in spite of the fact that it's a disproportionately populous and arid state.  They still let millionaires keep green lawns in deserts.  They aren't building desalination plants.  Even if the Great Lakes were emptied and all the water sent to California, it'd just ruin one environment to buy California another decade at most of water profligacy.  Any solution other than California returning to water equilibrium will only mean trading permanent damage to other ecosystems for temporary maintenance of California's unsustainable water usage."

stateball,363pyd,mego-pie,1 point,Thu May 28 21:37:53 2015 UTC,that... is... so much worse. pipes and pumps are the most efficient form or transportation. bottling it would be magnitudes more expensive due to the costs of shipping and the material needed to bottle. plus how would farmers use bottled water? they're not exactly sprinkler friendly in design.  if bottleign was cheaper there would by no such thing as oil

No, you know what, go with a bottling method that won't help the farmers. The arid state should not be growing food en-mass with water it doesn't have."
stateball,363pyd,RPM123,2,Mon Jun 1 07:13:24 2015 UTC,"tanker trucks are almost as bad. it would still cost way more to haul all that water in trucks than pipe it. not to mention that it's still not practical for high volume uses such as watering lawns, flushing toilets, taking showers and running sinks.   the cost to build and maintain a fleet of tanker trucks to bring enough water would be far more expensive than building some desalination plants  ( which are still astronomically expensive.) piping would be the cheapest way to do it and would still be unimaginably expensive for a relatively low value product.  honestly the best way to manage this would be to reduce water usage and the best way to do that would be to limit the agriculture of the state; which uses 95% of the water of the state and only makes up about 5% of the economy. sure some people will whine about not being able to get as much of their produce ""locally"" but nuts to them for choosing to live in such an arid area."

In fact, I remember there was once a blizzard on April 2nd. It does snow somewhat regularly in April. Other than that, there was a brief hailstorm in my neighborhood just 2 days ago, so that was something.  As for the comic itself, it was clearly very time-intensive. In total, it took around 6-8 hours; half of that time spent carefully applying fake-gradient effects on the clothes, clouds, and grass. In the end, though, it was well worth it. Here’s a timelapse of the process. I apologize for its quality; I’m not sure how to fix that.  Anyway, enjoy! :)"

Context:  In Southern California, sometimes there are strong dry winds blown from the Great Basin Desert after summer.  These are the Santa Ana Winds.  In Los Angeles lore, angelenos say that when these winds blow, deaths, crime rates go up.  But the worst is that if a wildfire and the Santa Ana winds together contribute to uncontrolled blazes that chars the hills which will lead to flooding when it rains.  This is meant to portray what California is in for as spring arrives and summer is coming.  And several fires had already started."

The biggest thing is that when being Polandball offensive, you need to be offensive equally to everyone.  What you're doing here is singling out one state when this joke works with having America, not any one state.  Do a little googling and you'll see that, as we commentors had be talking about, there's at least 8 other states that has more Muslims per capita than California.    Being fair about this issue would...require that you draw all the states that have Muslims, and then all the states with people that enlisted ever since 9/11 to fight turrists.  Which would be all 50 states, because every state has to send men to the military and all 50 states have Muslims.  Bottom line, the entirety of America is guilty of having Muslims and sending citizens off to fight terrorists so this is more appropriate as an America joke on Polandball proper."

Despite that, it'd have gone better if you explain the ""many people that I know who call this state Caliphornia"", because I truly haven't heard of it before. Were they CA residents or non-residents?  Were they saying this in jest or truly thinking the state has gone to the shitter?  Approxomately how many?  Any, pardon me for saying a slur, ""sand-nigger"" slurs experience like in the other states with even more Muslims that even Latinos get mistaken racism treatment?

The city folk say ""well the state needs us, we pay more in taxes than we take""  Except that number is really small, like, 4-6%, and the only reason they take so little is because the ""NYC"" area is geographically very small, and the number of taxpayers who live in ""NYC"" is also fairly small proportional to the rest of the state."

We maintain many of our own bridges, have our own departments of environmental services, parks police, even our own nationally recognized ID card. Much of this is subsidized by Albany, yes, but we fill out quite a bit of the budgets for these programs with our own income tax and sales and property tax revenues.

New Mexico has done some terrible things. Have you ever driven through the endless miles of tattered roads, as if even the road maintenance crew, your last reminder of a link to civilization, has forsaken you, and the only structures in sight being quiet rays of radio telescopes staring blankly into nebula, the cradles of the stars above?  New Mexico is death, destroyer of worlds, and the only thing separating him from Arizona is that he's much more reserved about it.  Also his irrelevance."

I have driven through the endless miles of tattered roads, for hours in the last days of 2014, and then run out of gas when the sun is about to set.  I guess I'm crazy for not being scared and only noted that it's the best set up for horror movies ever.

stateball,322jz9,Mizuneko-chan,63,Fri Apr 10 01:41:09 2015 UTC,California must be horrified that her son San Fransisco is dating Texas' son Austin.
stateball,322jz9,Guppyscum,14,Fri Apr 10 02:25:44 2015 UTC,Austin hasn't been the same after he spent twelve years making that movie.
stateball,322jz9,Kestyr,22,Fri Apr 10 03:03:17 2015 UTC,"Erm, I dunno how much Spanish you know, but San Francisco is masculine and THE city associated with homogay to us Californians.  So really it's homogay relationship and Cali is just trying to impress manry, oil-rich, cattle baron, and extremely hot future in-law."
stateball,322jz9,White_Null,11,Fri Apr 10 03:16:58 2015 UTC,Changed. Austin has a large community of gays so it would make sense. Now I think Texas will be pissed.
stateball,322jz9,Guppyscum,5,Fri Apr 10 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Oh in all seriousness, California has voted to stop SSM and the U.S. Supreme Court had to hammer that as unconstitutional to get California to accept it, just gotta wait and try to help smooth things a little lot.  And now I really wanna watch a sitcom of this.  A gay couple of Austin and SF with their forbidden Romance.  SF's the son of a Hollywood actress, Austin as the heir to rich WASP family that hadn't come out of the closet yet because it will surely destroy his father and family's rep."
stateball,322jz9,White_Null,3,Fri Apr 10 04:28:35 2015 UTC,"The Supreme Court did not say in Perry v. Hollingsworth that state level bans on SSM violated the 14th Amendment. They punted it on the issue of standing, letting the 9th Circuit ruling that did strike it be the precedent for the 9th Circuit.  They will be finally deciding the constitutionality of state level bans on SSM at the end of their current term."

stateball,322jz9,White_Null,2,Fri Apr 10 06:24:54 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously the states that appealled to the Supreme Court. Too many to list off the top of my head. They would want the bans to be maintained. Other states that have failed amicus curiae briefs on either side as well. I know Washington filed one in favor of striking the ban."

stateball,315gu7,Stellafera,41,Thu Apr 2 03:27:33 2015 UTC,"Context:  Finally, it is done. Basic story is a play on the term ""snowbirds"", the nickname that people in warm parts of America give to visitors who drop by for the winter and clog up roads while boosting up the tourism industry. Ohio has a reputation for being boring compared to traditional snowbird destination states like Nevada and Arizona. As for one of the other slightly more obscure jokes, Arizona liking zoos reflects upon the great wildlife conservation efforts of the Phoenix Zoo.    However,  a lot of this one is actually derived from a personal story of mine. You see, I spent my entire childhood growing up in Arizona.  A state which, while beautiful in many ways, is also a giant desert.  When I turned 10, I had just finished reading Jack Hanna's autobiography (he was the person who turned the Columbus Zoo into the fantastic one it is today), as I was a huge nerd. Anyhow, 10 year old me decides that for her special 10-year-old-birthday-trip, I wanted to go to OHIO. My parents obliged since we had relatives there and wouldn't have to pay for a hotel.  As it turned out, Ohio is a gorgeous state with many lovely parks and forested scenery. Everything dazzled me, including the fact that grass grew in the sidewalks. I knew all about other parts of the country having grass, but even sprouting in the sidewalks? The Eastern states must be a verdant paradise of nature! Clearly residents of these so-called ""concrete jungles"" know nothing of true rock and dust.   And that oce-APPARENTLY LAKE, SORRY  Erie? There were seafood restaurants by that ""lake"". Back in Arizona, a lake was what you called any body of water comfortably larger than your backyard. It was a magical experience and one that I am happy to share with Stateball. Grizzit Orriho!"

At least Michigan doesn't have Toledo, green water, and only one university worth mention anywhere!"

MI has tons of good universities too, but do you ever hear about Kettering without looking up Engineering Ivy league, or Wayne State without looking up murdered hipster college student, or Oakland University without looking up schools close to FCA world headquarters?  Nope, all you see are the two shitty public party schools which cost more than many private universities out there.  I will give you this though, Ohio has Cedar Point, Mi doesn't even have a state fair anymore."
stateball,30vwud,kepler-20b,2,Tue Mar 31 21:17:38 2015 UTC,MU and MSU are really that expensive? Damn.
stateball,30vwud,orthag,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:41:04 2015 UTC,"UoM is like $41k for out of state, MSU is only $36k/year.  Our top two private universities have a flat tuition of around $30k/year.  MIT, Harvard, and Caltech are around $43k.  OSU is only $26k/year for out of state students.  Still way more expensive than Wayne State or Oakland Universities, which are $19k and $17k respectively.  Now, not all these figures might not be equal of course, between housing, transportation, parking, etc, might or might not be included."

One of these days, I gotta do a comic about this.  California has Governor Moonbeam who's been doing well handling the state's finances, not be in denial about global climate change, and has set aside funding to handle the drought.

stateball,2zy1fe,DenimDave,4,Mon Mar 23 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, hmmm. While we in NJ might mock ourselves, I happen to like it here...  Our flag is normally on school buildings and the like, usually at equal height to the American flag. I was told that was mostly because it's easier to make all the flag poles the same height, mind you...or cheaper. In NJ cheaper is a good bet as well."
stateball,2zy1fe,mecichandler,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the bit about the flag heights is a common myth in Texas."
stateball,2zy1fe,White_Null,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"¯\_(ツ)_/¯   I was in NJROTC, but ages ago now. We had a lot to do about the flag...don't get the shortest person in classes to fold it unless you want the Commander to have a heart-attack, btw.  I can still tell you some of the meanings for the colors, just...when it comes to flag poles, if I remember, the US flag is to either be center and highest, or...possibly on it's right (ie, left when you're looking at it), but that is more when it's moving, and the center is when it's not, but, as I said, NJ."
stateball,2zy1fe,White_Null,7,Mon Mar 23 13:55:16 2015 UTC,Texas is allowed to fly it's flag at the same height as the American flag because the state was formerly an independent republic. We are not allowed to fly above the American flag.
stateball,2zy1fe,White_Null,3,Mon Mar 23 02:10:23 2015 UTC,"Just curious, is that also the case for Hawaii and California?"
stateball,2zy1fe,JowlesMcGee,3,Mon Mar 23 18:38:31 2015 UTC,"I've seen California's flag flown side by side with the Stars 'n' Stripes at the same height.  Funny story, we have this one new Texas Barbecue place that opened up at first flying two American flags and two Texan flags at the same height.  But eventually one of the Texas flags got taken down and replaced with California flag.  So now on top of that restaurant, flies two American flag, one Texas flag and one California flag all at the same height.  all in Southern California"

stateball,2zyovq,White_Null,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"Erm, Nevada is the only state where Prostitution is legal, and had been portrayed as one.  California knows that and just won't care, that's just how Nevada makes a living.  The West Coast doesn't work like the East Coast where if you're angry at someone you curse them to their face.  The West Coast is where people smile at you to your face, and then stab you in the back.  It's why the west coast seems very fake.  At the very worst, we'd get passive-aggressive."
stateball,2zyovq,White_Null,1 point,Mon Mar 23 06:36:35 2015 UTC,"You made good points there, especially the part where you said  people on the east coast would stab you if you got them angry, but where in this comic am I hinting at prostitution?"
stateball,2zyovq,Mizuneko-chan,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:31:08 2015 UTC,"had been portrayed as one.   Past tense, so somewhere in the past before your comic, not in this one because this one is now."
stateball,2zyovq,JowlesMcGee,2,Mon Mar 23 12:00:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry I misread that, and there is a reason why Nevada is acting that way to Nevada. In this comic, I wanted to portray California as this person who thinks that there so special and important, that the world revolves around them. So I made it that California feels that everyone should only care about him, and since Nevada is going with Texas, It really makes him mad. I wanted to make the person going with Texas someone close to California, and I thought that Nevada seemed pretty close to him."
stateball,2zyovq,Mizuneko-chan,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"No problem, it was probably so early that the sun wasn't up yet.  :P you've ended up written a character that's more New York or Toronto.  I couldn't resist knowing what I've seen though! Every week when I go grocery shopping, there is this Texas Roadhouse in this shopping center.  At first, right after it finished construction and opens, it flies two USA flags and two Texas flags at the same level, each on a corner.  Later on, one of the Texas flags was replaced with a California flag.  Everything from that point on was a-okay!  California is fine with there being Lone Star flag flown in his place."

I know I came off like a pissed off 14 year old but I'm not, I'm actually in my 30s. I didn't grow up in some dooms day cult either, I enjoyed my religious upbringing. It wasn't until the late 90's that I noticed a change. Now the same people that I grew up in church with (if they still go to church) aren't interested in what Jesus did or trying to practice what he preached. A lot of the baptist churches around here have turned into republican headquarters, which if that's your political leaning than that's fine, but I thought church was supposed to be about helping people not constantly berating them for not fitting directly into a mold. I like to hunt and fish so of course I own firearms but this new mantra of God, Guns, and Gold kinda scares me. It's almost cult like. I don't have a problem with guns or money but when they're put on the same level with God it seems to me to be counter to Jesus' teachings.  I'm sorry, I have a very narrow viewpoint of religion from the churches that are near me and what I see in today's politics and I'm mad at organized religion, not you or anybody else."

I, as a Californian, have no friggin clue what California and New Mexico's characterization is supposed to be like.  Many of the stuff I had ideas for are NorCal only or SoCal only."
stateball,2yri0p,Stellafera,2,Sat Mar 14 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"As a (former) Arizonan, New Mexico is one of my favorite states and I'd probably make a ton of comics about it if I weren't so lazy. There's just so many facets to exploit.  New Mexico is sort of like the Canada of the Southwest USA. He's very nice but also tends to be overlooked to the point of others not realizing he's a state. He is very close to Arizona and Colorado, but they are... pretty much his only friends.   Which might be because NM is also very introverted (in real life terms, it retains much of its Old West heritage) and obsessive about his hobbies. He's the artsy type, but also has this weird thing about red vs green chili (the state question) and is a total UFO nut thanks to Roswell. New Mex also has quite the dark past for such a nice guy, what with that Old West cowboy frontier business and being the center of the Manhattan project. In the present day, NM is fairly poor; much of the state has that vague ""dilapidated middle of nowhere desert"" feel to it.  New Mexico, like Arizona, has Mexican and Native American influence, but much more strongly due to having far fewer transplants, so he is apt to pepper his dialogue with Spanish. His relationship with California is likely mildly amicable, although slightly strained by the fact that your influence pulls him and Arizona apart and his general resistance to outside cultural pressures."
stateball,2yri0p,White_Null,3,Sat Mar 14 04:21:00 2015 UTC,"I can too if it weren't for me procrastinating a lot, thanks.  Hmm, not close to his other two neighbors Utah and Texas?  I've always wondered how he's a solid Democratic state when Arizona and Texas are extremely Republican.  I went to New Mexico once, I've just realized that it feels extremely southwestern, I just got annoyed that everything in a grocery store is at least twice the price I get in SoCal.  These backgrounds are pretty easy to pin down due to having one economic, cultural center.  But....seriously, SoCal influences Arizona in what way other than same accent? yes, seriously California is that oblivious/full of themselves  I see New Mexico license plates once in a while, but the ones I see everyday are Nevada and Arizona.  And Texas doesn't influence New Mexico?  Ranching is still a big part of the state, as far as I can see while driving thru."
stateball,2yri0p,Stellafera,3,Sat Mar 14 04:40:26 2015 UTC,"Not really on Utah. Arizona and Texas come across as Republican, sure, but Utah is the most conservative state in the NATION and even is conservative in urban areas like Salt Lake City, which is unusual. Mormonism is huge in Utah. Other than climate, Utah and New Mexico have little in common (Mormons are more common in some of Utah's other neighbors like Arizona and Idaho). As for Texas, I'm not sure they realize that they border NM :P. Ranching is huge in NM, true, and near their border with Texas they also have oil going on, but Texas loses NM influence fast as you venture from the state border.   As far as SoCal influence, I'm biased due to having lived in Phoenix (Northern Arizona is more like Colorado and cities like Tuscon are more like New Mexico), but my impression visiting Los Angeles was that it was like Phoenix with a beach. So many palm trees in Phoenix, when the natural state of vegetation is more like mesquite trees everywhere with varying levels of cacti. Only 38% of Arizonans were actually born in their own state, which means we kinda cribbed culture from the nearest most influential state. Heck, I'm not even an Arizona native (though I moved in at a young age)."

Long long time ago when Hawaii was still an independent Kingdom, the Californian send them their laundry to do because it was cheaper.  As for Alaska, back when Russia Amerika Company ran out of game up north, and needed food for their settlers.  They sailed south to California, bringing some Aleuts with them.  Fort Ross and Russia River in Northern California is still around today.  After the purchase of Alaska, most of the original Russian settlers in Alaska settled in Northern California.  So more likely, in California's mind, those two states are younger siblings and thus never someone to be romantically involved with.

He is primarily remembered for severely beating Senator Charles Sumner (Free Soil-Massachusetts), an abolitionist, with a cane on the floor of the United States Senate, on May 22, 1856. This was in retaliation for an anti-slavery speech by Sumner in which Sumner attacked Brooks' cousin, Senator Andrew Butler (Democrat-South Carolina). Sumner was seriously injured, and unable to serve in the Senate for three years, though eventually he recovered somewhat.

As long as your comic fits the theme and follows the normal stateball rules, we'll submit your comic anonymously to the contest thread (which will pop up a week after the theme is announced).

stateball,2vwitx,White_Null,3,Mon Feb 16 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"My impression as a teen of the time was that during the tech boom there was a large migration of Californians north that built large 'McMansions' everywhere. It not only drive housing costs up but lowered the overall quality of the homes available to live in. Locally it was a large contribution to the housing crisis. After they got here they also tried to make us more like home and change everything. It had a large effect on our culture, politics, and even architecture/feel of our cities (Example, pearl district portland) 'californiafication' Not just through hollywood (movies/tv) but by them actually coming in and living with us. I think there is still resentment for that.  Mostly towards Californians in general because we all know Californians that are alright, haha. I think it is mostly that we don't want the successful vacationing hot-shots to decide they like it here and that they will decide to stay and build giant houses while then taking our local jobs."
stateball,2vwitx,Machcharge,2,Mon Feb 16 02:49:02 2015 UTC,"Let's take just the San Fran bay area mindset into account. People campaigned heavily against construction efforts citing concerns for sprawl during a time where there was massive growth of the city. This led to rising costs as millions more were coming to live in a city where there was no more room left. As highrises such as those in Manhattan became a vilified concept, you can't really expand on the amount of people per square mile that much.  This causes people to live in outer areas to commute. Now these same people also don't like others doing commuting since they're usually environmental types that see cars as heresy and bike lanes as sacred. Efforts against it and introductions of mass bike lanes will lead there to be more congestion as now they're down a lane or two.   It would go farther but by then they're usually to the point where the can't afford the high rent. As a result they keep their same politics and export themselves to other areas and start to demand the same things in their new residences. Add to that one of the immediate things in Colorado was their exportation of gun politics that put restrictions on the state known for fucking mountainmen."
stateball,2vwitx,White_Null,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:07:41 2015 UTC,"snickers so you guys are actually hating on Northern California, our financial and political overlords, Southern California here is very amused.  Tell you guys what, there's actually one very simple issue that I can trace from everything you've just said.    It's the earthquakes and San Andreas Fault line that will one day destroy California.  It is for that reason it is even more insanely expensive to build absolutely earthquake proof highrises like every other metropolis, and proper subway, trains etc that are earthquake-proof from the horrors such as 1906.    The state had attempted to try to impose stricter emission taxes on people to give people incentive to drive less when commuting.  Which results in the highest gas prices in the entire nation and it just seems like going anywhere else would be better.  The people that moved out are the people that are unwilling to compromise and absolutely must get their way.  The Californians that are in California are the ones that can compromise, liberals with conservatives, natives and immigrants, the big city and the farms.  Though it is very important for everyone to remember that Northern California is the more liberal one, Southern California is more conservative.  So there's the very weird things of San Francisco being known for the start of the infamous LGBT community, California Prop 8 was voted to stop same gender marriages.  It's because Southern California has more people and decided no.  Same thing with pot, in the east, California was known for the best pot but now it's the only state on the West Coast that cannot into High, Southern California has more people and said No.  Which is exactly why the more uncompromising Northern Californians escaped north or east to freedom!"

stateball,2vwitx,Lawfulgray,1 point,Mon Feb 16 04:47:03 2015 UTC,"It really depends on which group of Californians the anti-tourism board is trying to ward off.  By the way, you're asking for warding off tourists, not warding off those that want to move there.      I'm Southern Californian so we already think that the rest of the Pacific Northwest is basically the same as Northern California so there's no point in going up north to be food for mosquitoes.  Southern California is the southern most 10 counties of California, think the people from Los Angeles metro, Hollywood, Disney, the desert, and where the Rose Bowl is!  If you are trying to ward off Northern Californians, the upper 48 counties that includes Silicon Valley.....  I imagine they are probably going up there for the same reasons Southern Californians go to Baja California, Nevada and Arizona.  Also to get away from the other California.  I suppose reminding them that earthquakes still exist all the way up north will be the first step. And you guys need to help Northern California get pot legalized, we SoCalers don't want our government overlords to be even more useless by being stoned all the time.   In other words, everything you're proud of in your state, is what's attracting NorCalers.  It's a bit like Canadians looking at Americans, make your state's flaws noticable enough, but not paint a big bright neon warning sign.  That turns it into the big red shiny button that's labeled, ""Do not push"" no one can resist not pushing it that way."

stateball,2vm6t5,JowlesMcGee,33,Thu Feb 12 03:52:36 2015 UTC,"Context: The other day in my Environmental Studies class, the professor brought up that there's been a theory proposed that the stereotype of the lazy Southerner came about because of the fact that things like malaria and hookworm were very, very present in the South (and almost exclusively the South) at around the start of the 1900's. Thus, Southerners didn't have much energy to do things/do them fast, what with their bodies fighting off these diseases.  The first sentence here and then this tiny image (found from this page) seem to suggest that there's some weight behind this theory.  Regardless, the idea of people being all judging about a sick and dying population was funny to me, so I attempted to make a quick and crappy comic to share this humor.  EDIT: The irony of doing this comic to avoid doing my 50+ pages of reading has just dawned on me. I am the lazy Southerner."

stateball,2tvq6a,BlahTheAmazing,36,Tue Jan 27 20:42:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah...this was my comic for the most recent family-related contest.  The context, which was that Georgia was originally intended to be an alternative for debtor's prison, managed to be obscure enough that most people wouldn't get it, but well-known enough that those who did would probably be too sick of it already. I didn't expect it to be in the top 5, so I was pretty pleasantly surprised at the 2nd place."

stateball,2tvq6a,Gabcab,3,Wed Jan 28 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, might not have been the right one.  But basically the idea is that back in Britain, people in debt would go to prison, which was stupid because prison is the worst possible place to get enough money to pay off the debt in the first place. So one of the MPs, James Oglethorpe, proposed that instead of going to prison, debtors could settle in Georgia."
stateball,2tvq6a,LCD75,2,Wed Jan 28 22:28:41 2015 UTC,"Ah interesting, so like Australia for those in debt!"
stateball,2tvq6a,Stellafera,2,Wed Jan 28 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, the plan never got through, but Georgia was still settled and some of the settlers normal convicts got sentenced there. So kinda more like Australia and kinda less like it. I guess."

stateball,2rx8xs,Kestyr,18,Sat Jan 10 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"Realistically it will be a huge shit on the poor and working poor in the long run if widely implemented. Good intentions but people often won't be able to afford the extra two years as they need to work as soon as they can in order to support themselves and their family. This will only make it so that positions need higher qualifications than they have as the real value of a degree will plummet. Jobs that required Bachelor degrees will now need masters, etc.   It's also another issue where Obama seeks to widen the amount of people within a system rather than fix it. Similar to how the ACA widened the amount of people in the insurance pool by making participation mandatory rather than reform the real costs of healthcare. Rather than fix university tuition, especially as the government is now a direct participator in the securities and student loan industry, they go after something entirely at the bottom rung. Someone did the math and it would end up increasing taxes by about 40 billion per year, given that tuition remains at the same per credit rate, which is a big reason why there's opposition. It doesn't have entirely to do with education as it does with the costs involved. It's a financial issue that he's presenting as a social one.  He lost the midterm as they heavily campaigned on social issues rather than economic, now they're trying to regain fervor and talking points for the next couple years. This is my observations as a centrist independent who despises both parties."

stateball,2rx8xs,Kestyr,4,Sat Jan 10 15:01:25 2015 UTC,It's a problem that was created by the Obama government and they're chief participators in the student loan bubble that is causing costs to raise.   The problem being that it's a long term revenue stream for the government as the debt will compound. The government is making a shit ton of money off of it and there's not really a reason for them to stop it as its a way for them to officially make a fuck ton of more tax revenue per year without officially raising taxes.

stateball,2rx8xs,Kestyr,6,Sat Jan 10 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"It depends! A lot of people go to expensive universities and get useless degrees and then complain about it all. Real /r/lostgeneration fucks.   People often are told that they can be anything they set out to, but in reality have expectations towards something more realistic. Try and go towards a field that's competitive or one that actually has growth and jobs in. There's not jobs in the social sciences fields or gender studies, as an example.   Look into loans and how they work before you dabble into it, understand money before you play with it and it will help in the long run to keeping debts down."
stateball,2rx8xs,HaPTiCxAltitude,3,Sat Jan 10 15:58:52 2015 UTC,"Really more of a joke, thanks though.   I plan on majoring in comp sci so having a job probably won't be a major issue, also I will be applying for a military scholarship so cost hopefully won't be an issue."

If you have a degree in a lot of the Liberal Arts programs, you're basically fucked unless you get a PhD. If you get a PhD, then you can compete for the small segment of jobs (Mostly working for a University or a Museum) that are available.  Get a STEM degree and you're likely to be able to pay off your debts rather quickly (unless you decided to go to a stupidly expensive school without scholarships). If you take out $100,000 in loans to make $35,000 that doesn't make any sense."

stateball,2r9pz6,Mizuneko-chan,4,Mon Jan 5 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"""Easy""."
stateball,2r9pz6,RMS_Gigantic,9,Mon Jan 5 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"Easy.  Step 1) Send an landing force from Boston or New York City into Halifax to sever Canada's main method of communicating with Great Britain (if this invasion fails, drop bombs on the place until the same effect is achieved; use of poison gas is a viable option here)  Step 2) Send the Navy up to blockade Canada's primary and secondary eastern ports mainly, but also to patrol the Great Lakes and blockade the country's Pacific ports secondarily. We need to keep Great Britain out of Canada, and that includes protecting against possible invasion forces from India and Australia!  Step 3) Send an invasion force from the Minnesota/Dakotas area into Winnipeg in order to take control of the railroad hub in the city, thus effectively dividing the entire nation in half east-to-west  Step 4) Seize the nickel mines of Ontario. We can use that nickel to produce steel for the war effort!  Step 5) Before Great Britain even starts peace talks, begin turning Canada into US territory, and send its provinces as far as possible into the statehood process before even beginning peace talks with the United Kingdom: the UK is unlikely to want to tick us off given our industrial power, so we can negotiate from a position of relative power so we keep ownership of the territory we've already claimed (i.e., Canada and the UK's Caribbean territories)!  And that's all there is to it. Canada annexed."

stateball,2r9pz6,RMS_Gigantic,4,Mon Jan 5 05:05:31 2015 UTC,"If anything, time has only made this plan easier. The British Empire is nowhere near what it used to be, and so the gap between US military strength and British military strength has only grown.

stateball,2r9pz6,LBHM,1 point,Wed Jan 7 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"This would eventually come back to the whole ""U.S. vs The World"" scenario. The fact of the matter is, presuming this is a conventional and not nuclear war, no other nation in the world has the logistical capability to land and support an invasion force into North America. They lack the naval power, the transport capacity, and/or the training for such a large scale operation and quite simply cannot project their military power beyond their immediate regions . The U.S. Carrier Battle Groups on the other hand can each operate self efficiently and strike with impunity basically anywhere in the world.  In an offensive war it would be a fairly even match up, but in a defensive war with the nations of the world attempting to  the U.S. would almost certainly be the victor."

The Stainless Banner looks like the white flag of surrender and the Bloodstained Banner never saw combat.

Instead of going on the Senate, I decided to make a comic based on the rise and fall of certain major states (Virginia, New York, and California).   Virginia was quite influential in the early years of America, not anymore. I just used New York slicing West Virginia off of Virginia as an explanation for the fall of Virginia.  California knocked out New York with a large gold, implying the Gold Rush that drove alot of people to California.  And Texas loading his gun is basically an allusion to Texas economic and population growth and how some people believe that Texas's economy and population can surpass California's soon"

stateball,2phgu0,BaylorNinja,4,Tue Dec 16 23:29:25 2014 UTC,"Yep. In fact, the one Supreme Court case that ruled secession was never legal and the Civil War was merely a rebellion, Texas v. White was specifically in regard to Texas. Short version: Confederate government of Texas sold bonds the state owned prior to secession to fund the war. People tried to cash them in and the US government refused and ruled that the Confederate government had no legal right to sell them in the first place, because the US doesn't recognize the right for a state to secede."

stateball,2phgu0,BaylorNinja,6,Wed Dec 17 15:59:33 2014 UTC,"What do you mean? It's was a legal question of whether a state has the right to secede or not, it had been debated prior the the Civil War among many political figures at the time. This was the US Supreme Court ruling once and for all on a Constitutional matter of ""No, a state does not have the right to secede."" The Supreme Court has the right and power to decide that the US does not recognize secession of states as a legal power that states have. In this view, the states owe their existence to the Union and are not an independent power that willingly becomes a part of union which they can leave whenever they like. Their decision held more weight considering it came after the country had just fought a war for several years about the matter."
stateball,2phgu0,captmonkey,2,Wed Dec 17 16:16:34 2014 UTC,The supreme court only has control over laws under the constitution not the constitution itself. And adding no secession to the constitution was not on the courts article 3 powers
stateball,2phgu0,Zehuffm1,3,Wed Dec 17 17:02:03 2014 UTC,"It's not adding ""no secession"" to the Constitution, it was ruling that seceding from the Union was not a legal action that a state could take under the US Constitution. The legal matter in question was the secession of Texas, the court's interpretation of the Constitution was that under the Articles of Confederation, the Union was stated as perpetual and that the Constitution's preamble says it's purpose is ""in order to form a more perfect union"", which the court took to mean the Union under the Constitution is also perpetual and cannot be dissolved by a state. Therefore secession was an illegal and unconstitutional act and all actions taken by the government set up following secession were null and void."

To clarify I mean that PR had an internal vote to try to become a state and their own populace said no. Might be misremembering or misinformed.
stateball,2oewja,unstyll,17,Sat Dec 6 03:23:51 2014 UTC,"It's complicated. Statehood won, but...  Just under 50% want statehood, maybe 45% like things the way they are, and the rest want some other option. They designed the vote in two stages: 1) status quo y/n, 2) if no then what, and with that ballot design statehood was guaranteed to win. Also on that ballot, an anti-statehood, pro-status quo Governor was elected, so mixed message.  This referendum wasn't preapproved by Congress like they'd done before, so it was more of a nonbinding opinion poll. Obama said Congress should act on the result but Congress isn't. The feeling in Washington is that the comic is wrong, PR would become a Dem stronghold and the GOP doesn't want that. (Note there have been four PR status referenda, all four under Dem presidents.)  Basically nothing is happening but that's probably the best option for now."

The Puerto Rico statehood bill hasn't had action in the House since May 2013, when it was referred to committee, which is very early in the process. And the Senate bill is at the same stage and has only two cosponsors, which is the Senate's way of saying ""Hahahaha... No."" The clock has run out, the new Congress is coming in January, meaning any bill ""making its way through"" is dead, the process has to start fresh."

It's a shame I'll probably never be able to actually visit there since you have to get permission from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which is very unlikely since the Air Force still has a pretty big presence there. I believe you also need permission from the Air Force to land at their airfield. No airlines go there, so you would also likely have to charter a private plane. Chartering one with enough range to get from Hawaii to Wake could cost quite a bit. Maybe some tour company will run a tour there; one did a a day tour there a few years ago. Or maybe one day it will end up like Midway, with the airfield being given to the USFWS, making it easier to go there."

So to re-explain the context  California and the whole gun-banning thing is a play on Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and how she always seem to have a gun-control bill ready whenever a shooting occurs.  Texas and the whole free healthcare = socialism alludes to the government shutdown that was the result of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) holding nearly a day long fillibuster in the Senate against Obamacare.  Kentucky and the whole NSA thingie is a reference to Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) who not only made a 13 hour fillibuster against drone strikes but also on how he's trying to sue the President on the NSA issue.

We agreed in December 1836 to the June 15th 1836 act of Congress that re-drew our borders to include the western portion of the UP.

I'd like to thank my family and friends for supporting me through this project, thanks to the crew and ""thank you"" to /u/arrz and /u/Mizuneko-chan for being my #1 inspirations. Thank you to all of stateball for granting me the awesome NRA guns.   So, as you may have guessed, my comic is about Ohio and of course the Wright brothers who originated from there. They invented the airplane in 1900-somthing. Since then, Ohio has gone up, up and away. Today, most of the astronauts of NASA, originate from Ohio. (IIRC)"

Twice during trial runs the ship sank. Eventually, it went after the U.S.S. Housatonic, successfully sinking it with it's explosive harpoon.  It failed to return to port though and to this day there is no conclusive evidence as to why it sank.  Tried submitting this to r/polandball but was told internal U.S. affairs needed to be posted here. First comic ever, be gentle."

stateball,2c1rbp,bizclassproject,13,Wed Jul 30 14:18:11 2014 UTC,"We're having the worst drought in at least 150 years, and possibly in the last 500 years. Something definitely needs to be done, and quickly. Water conservation is by far the most cost efficient method for maintaining sustainable water levels in lakes, rivers, and aquifers. If we lessen our current use, we won't have to depend on expensive things like water recycling and desalination to bathe and drink.  Across the state, massive conservation efforts have taken place, yet it is still not enough. Water usage in San Diego and LA counties actually ROSE during the last year. Southern California only has about 12-18 months of water left. SERIOUS economic and ecological damages are happening because of this drought.  If you live in California or the West, here are some tips to help you decrease water use by the recommended 20%  Turn off decorative water fountains  Let some grass go brown  Raise Awareness  Increase water recycling  Shorter showers, and turn off the water when you lather up  If it's yellow, let it mellow, if it's brown, flush it down.  Full loads of laundry and dishes.  Eating less red meat, which uses more water per pound than almost any other food."
stateball,2c1rbp,avocadonumber,4,Wed Jul 30 02:16:22 2014 UTC,maybe we should stop letting the golf courses take all the water.

Arizona had/has real estate speculators that wrote small print into contracts with local residents and governments that they will maintain their golf courses with well water if there are not enough homes sold to furnish enough recycled water to maintain it. Because of the financial crisis/home-loan tightening etc. water levels in local wells are now way below where people drilled down to 30 years ago. These greedy asshoes need to be put in jail.

Baby Canada is so cute!  EDIT: Screwed up big this time. Colonies weren't heavily taxed prior to F-I war.

Libraries - public property Nightclubs - you're not allowed to drink and carry.   Ultimately though, a criminal is gonna bring a gun anywhere regardless of the law, so why not let CCW holders do the same?"
stateball,2bcxbd,Xaaba,7,Tue Jul 22 12:36:50 2014 UTC,"I think people have some delusions of grandeur when it comes to CCW. They think they are going to see a bank robbery and do some barrel-roll over a couch shooting all 5 bank robbers in the heart or something, or ""I would have stopped that school shooting if I was there!""  When in reality they are probably more likely to shoot someone in some stupid confrontation, miss and shoot a bystander, shoot themselves, or all the above while drunk."
stateball,2bcxbd,snackshack,8,Tue Jul 22 16:10:46 2014 UTC,"CCW makes a difference more often than you think, you just don't hear about it. Just the other day a passerby who was carrying was able to hold a man at gunpoint who had just stabbed a guy. Without him, the guy gets away. Instead, he's in jail.  In my hometown a man prevented a robbery by shooting two armed men in a grocery store. The two unarmed security guards couldn't do anything. These are just off the top of my head,  I could come up with many more if I took a second to research.  As for your basis that a person carrying is more likely to injure others while drunk, I have yet to read any study or see any data that would justify that kind of stereotyping. That's merely your own personal bias towards people who carry.  I have, however, read reports that state that general public is 5.3 times more likely to be arrested for violent offenses and 14 times more likely to be arrested for non-violent offenses than concealed carry weapon permit holders.   Most people with CCL are responsible individuals who take the responsibility of carrying a firearm very seriously.   As for the delusions of grandeur, I'm sure a small minority feel that way. However, according to a 2001 poll, 59% of people who carry a gun outside the home do so because it makes them feel safer. To me, that's a perfectly acceptable reason.  I understand that you do not personally agree with CCW(which I totally understand. I used to be in the same boat until a life changing experience), but please refrain from making generalizations like most of them are reckless with their firearms. It's inaccurate and adds little to the discussion."

stateball,2bcxbd,snackshack,3,Wed Jul 23 05:15:50 2014 UTC,"To be fair, those numbers are related specifically to gun ownership in the home, not to ccw usage. You have the same rate if you carry or if you keep a shotgun in your safe at home for duck hunting. Concealed carry isn't enabling more tragedies.  Also, the report ""Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence""(commissioned by the federal government last year) shows that studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was “used“ by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies."

All we know is that as a whole, people who have guns in the home have that percentage. A subgroup of that whole(CCL holders) may have different numbers."

The reason being, IIRC, that getting the license involves a background check of some kind, and I guess if the state trusts you to carry a gun in public, then it can trust you to not be a political assassin or terrorist.

stateball,2b47uf,ReckZero,1 point,Sun Jul 20 16:12:21 2014 UTC,"Not sure I follow. I meant that slavery made up less of an economic interest in Texas, since a smaller percentage of white landowners could afford to maintain slaves. Texas was a relatively new state, one that Americans had more or less unilaterally seized. White property owners had to contend with incumbent Mexican and Native populations for ownership and land use. On the other hand, older states in the Union like South Carolina and Deep South states like Alabama and Mississippi had very high rates of slave usage by landowners--nearly 50%. Plantation operations there depended on the institution. Therefore, they had more at stake and would have been better candidates for the cheer.  As for other reasons for the civil war, there were plenty (state patriotism, state sovereignty, war profiteering, love of violence, ignorance of war's true nature, want of purpose), but none of them were completely free from slavery. I am not sure what you meant with that.   Mind you, we are talking about a silly, funny cartoon on a small subreddit."
stateball,2b47uf,Mizuneko-chan,0,Mon Jul 21 13:59:47 2014 UTC,"I know, but it's fun to talk about these things. Plus I want to get this saved somewhere so I can use it on my Libertarian friends.  Everything about the war was about slavery. What you had was a pervasive, white-superiority culture (that generally pervaded the nation at the time, but especially slave states) that believed that white men were freed to be wealthy, productive aristocrats who could be thinkers, intellectuals and equals to European courtiers by being given the free time they needed to pursue these things on the backs of black slave labor. By given white men the freedom to not be ""wage slaves,"" as they claimed northern men were by working in factories, they were given the chance to truly pursue their superiority. Even poor whites agreed this was a goal, either through loyalty, racism or just conformity to local culture. Everyone sought to protect this at all costs.  State sovereignty was a defense of the right of slave states to continue to own and exploit slaves. This neo-Confederate belief that it has to do with states rights is a construction to water down the fact that these states' citizens, almost uniformly, extolled the virtues of slavery every chance they got. It became such a contentious issue that every time a new state was admitted into the union, it had to have another state of opposing view on the matter added as well to maintain balance. In the case of Kansas, Missouri (Which had a much lower slave ownership rate than even Texas did - 8 percent to Texas's 28 percent at the time of the war) mobilized men to cross the border and stuff ballots to ensure the state entered the Union pro-slavery. Blood was shed in the process. This inter-state war can be considered the first major fight of the Civil War.  Further, after the start of the war, it was an express objective of Southern leadership to eventually establish a pro-slave empire across the Americas, beginning with Cuba. Cuba had experienced a number of invasions of these American military expeditions before the war. Invaders were called filibusters.  I think the strongest evidence of this is in the way Confederate forces treated black prisoners of war: They were usually enslaved, sometimes executed, on the spot. This treatment spurred outrage from Northerners, even back then.  I'd recommend the Battlecry of Freedom, by James McPhearson. The first half is devoted to the political situation and motivations of the war. It's well documented that the South had slavery and belief in the value of slavery as a primary motivator, and this was true across the board. Few Southerners would have denied this at the time. Any claim they weren't is after-the-fact revisionism. The rest of the book is a narrative of the battles, which is fun to read."

Also I think the guy trying to make this happen (it won't) is splitting California so more conservatives get more electoral votes. Basically gerrymering  on a massive scale
stateball,2asii4,AdwokatDiabel,9,Tue Jul 15 20:45:13 2014 UTC,"Not only would this asinine thought experiment give a load of electoral votes to the republicans, but it would also change the balance of the senate. ""Silicon Valley"" and ""West California"" would be solid democrat, but ""Jefferson"", ""North California"", and ""Central California"" would be guaranteed republican seats, and ""South California"" could be in play for either party.  And this being 'Merica, those are our only two options."
stateball,2asii4,sacman701,5,Tue Jul 15 21:15:23 2014 UTC,That's fine.  At least those people will be represented now.

Jefferson, CenCal, and ""SoCal"" were all around 50-50 in 2012 and could go either way for now, but CenCal and SoCal are trending hard toward the Dems and would probably be solid Dem within 10 years."
stateball,2asii4,arok,3,Wed Jul 16 11:43:40 2014 UTC,"Considering that right now, the entirety of California is one big guaranteed democrat seat, plus a guaranteed 55 electoral votes in the presidential election.   That's one fifth of the required electoral votes required to win the presidency, all lumped into one state that is effectively a guaranteed blue. Anybody in California who votes red can bet that their vote means absolutely jack.  So maybe splitting it up would give more opportunity for the republicans to get electoral votes.  As it stands now, the democrats can pretty much count on California, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington, Maine, and Hawaii going to them.   Unless my math is wrong, that's 112 electoral votes more or less guaranteed to go to the dems. Nearly a quarter of the votes needed to take the presidency are just about guaranteed to go to the dems.   California is 55. Texas, the largest almost-guaranteed red state, is only 38. That's AFTER an increase of 4 in 2010.  The scale of electoral votes is really tipped in the favor of the dems, out the gate.   What about the rest of the states? Well, in terms of geographical area, the republicans basically run the country. (image)  Do you notice anything about that county-by-county map? Most major cities in high-electoral-vote states are going for the democrats. What about that big part of California, there, that went red? Their votes don't matter. Not counted. Zip, thrown out the window. How is that fair?   Personally, I say to hell with the electoral college, but failing that, dividing up California to give more accurate representation to its citizens seems like a pretty fair deal."

It's just an aesthetic thing, but I've found a nice medium line looks good.  And like /u/tastymilkshake said, you can use the line tool for... yknow, lines.

stateball,20l3dc,Gillburger,4,Sun Mar 16 22:57:07 2014 UTC,Context?
stateball,20l3dc,Gillburger,13,Mon Mar 17 01:55:22 2014 UTC,"It's St.Patrick's Day. Well, tomorrow for me it is.  West Virginia and Kentucky are both known for being hillbillies, which are Scots-Irish from Ulster/Northern Ireland. So, they've dressed up as Northern Ireland unionists, while the rest of the states are all Irish and carrying Irish flags.   It's just basically the difference between the hillbillies/Scots-Irish and the rest of the states/Irish-Americans."
stateball,20l3dc,Pezzi,4,Mon Mar 17 01:58:41 2014 UTC,"Oh, I see but can't see why everyone hates scots-Irish's clothes on every st. Patrick day?"
stateball,20l3dc,Don_Pelayo,8,Mon Mar 17 02:01:32 2014 UTC,"In the grand scheme, orange is the color the protestant Irish wore. Green is associated with Irish Nationalism, which the protestant Irish were... well, they're still part of Great Britain, so let's just say they're not exactly considered nationalists by those who wear green.   So... while I can't speak for the exact states feeling one way or another, most likely it has ties to that and immigrants. Oh and Saint Patrick is a Catholic saint, and those wearing orange are pretty much saying ""We're protestants and we can party and you can't stop us"" or something of the sort (I don't really care either way and am just guessing here). Personally, I wear orange, but that's because I'm not Irish. Though I live in South Florida, so... yeah, who knows.  On a separate note, blue is the color of the Order of Saint Patrick, which is why you'll sometimes (rarely) see people wearing light blue (think sky blue iirc).  Source: English-American with a protestant half and a catholic half. And wikipedia  edit: If you want a far more official and scholarly answer to this question, I'd suggest asking /r/askhistorians though you'll want to make sure the question fits the rules. They're one of the most helpful bunches when it comes to answering... well, historical questions."

They are strongly opposed to Irish Catholic republican (want Northern Ireland to join the Republic of Ireland) groups."
stateball,20l3dc,captainfreiheit,3,Wed Mar 19 00:49:43 2014 UTC,"No, it's more they're angry that Kentucky and West Virginia do this every single year, constantly. You'd expect them to remember when St.Patrick's Day is, but nope.   It's not a very clever thing."

The area is thought to have received the name because its riverside location made it susceptible to concentrations of fog and industrial smoke, an atmospheric trait that did not prevent the neighborhood from becoming the original location of the United States Naval Observatory. Foggy Bottom is west of downtown Washington, in the Northwest quadrant, bounded roughly by 17th Street to the east, Rock Creek Parkway to the west, Constitution Avenue to the south, and Pennsylvania Avenue to the north.

stateball,1vjh2a,allinonebot,1 point,Wed Jan 29 02:29:57 2014 UTC,"Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack :      The 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack was the food poisoning of 751 individuals in The Dalles, Oregon, United States, through the deliberate contamination of salad bars at ten local restaurants with salmonella. A leading group of followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho) had hoped to incapacitate the voting population of the city so that their own candidates would win the 1984 Wasco County elections. The incident was the first and single largest bioterrorist attack in United States history. The attack is one of only two confirmed terrorist uses of biological weapons to harm humans since 1945.

I could go to Eugene and back and only eight hours of my day would be devoted to driving (well only two actually because I'm in Corvallis right now but that's beside the point). I wouldn't call Eugene less interesting than The Dalles. Historically I dunno which is more interesting, but as far as actual things to do, there's a lot more going on in the Willamette Valley than the Gorge. That said, I'd rather live in the Gorge than the Willamette Valley."

I had a look at the easier state flags and then concocted a comic that would please the Murica-crowd. My inspiration was that fake Sarah Palin-quote (""I can see Russia from my house"" or something).  I just post my winner speech here as well.  There are just mods who preside over the destinies of contest-entries, and who will raise up rules to fight our battles for us. The battle, good sirs, is not to the good drawers alone; it is to the vigilantly punning, to the active, to the ones bravely butthurt inducing. Besides, sirs, we have an election. If I was base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but only submission and slavishly drawing! Our chains are broken! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of /r/stateball! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I repeat, sirs, let it come!  It is in vain, sirs, to extentuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the main-sub will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! My brethren /u/Challis2070 and I are already in the field! Why stand you there idle? What is it that you gentlemen wish? What would you have? Is laziness so dear, or slothfulness so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of slavery and a name without guns? Forbid it, Almighty Reichtangle!
