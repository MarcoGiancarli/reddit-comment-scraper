This part seems relevant:   7.2 Multios  If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once, the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies its input to all the specified outputs, similar to tee, provided the MULTIOS option is set, as it is by default. Thus:  date >foo >bar   writes the date to two files, named ‘foo’ and ‘bar’. Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus  date >foo | cat   writes the date to the file ‘foo’, and also pipes it to cat.   Without quotes around the hyphen, I think that it's being interpreted by grep as “read from standard input”, so zsh is making your command behave like:  /etc/mirrorlist> grep -A1 'United States' - | grep -v ^-   But that's just a guess."

Your shell may be interpreting the caret symbol in a very specific way. In bash, for example, the caret character is used for something called ""quick substitution"".   In CSH and TCSH, the caret is used for control characters.  Ancient shells interpret the caret as a synonym of pipe.  Yours may be doing something similar. Try using a different shell and/or a different terminal emulator (xterm, gnome-terminal, puTTY, etc).  In any case, the lesson here is: Always quote your regular expressions to prevent weird shit like this from happening!"

linuxquestions,3e1j77,nanokaK,5,Wed Jul 22 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"Some options that you might want to investigate:   Use a terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux, or byobu, which is a pretty front-end for either of them (tmux by default).  This runs a sort of virtual terminal inside your terminal, in which you can open multiple terminal windows and switch between them. The session persists when you close the terminal, and you can reattach it from a new terminal later. So whatever you open from those terminal windows hangs around when you close the terminal. This is useful for a lot more than keeping your PDFs open -- for example, if you ssh to another server and use screen on the other side, you 1) can open multiple terminal windows on the server without having to make additional ssh commenctions, and 2) have a session on the server that won't die if you disconnect.  So you can keep reconnecting and picking up exactly where you left off. Use a dropdown or ""quakelike"" terminal like yakuake, guake or tilda -- it's a terminal which pops down from the top of your screen when you press a hotkey. So instead of opening and closing new terminals all the time you can keep one terminal open, and hide it when you don't need it. This is also useful because you can ""summon"" the same terminal to whatever workspace you're currently on.   I use both of these things: I have a separate tab in yakuake for each physical machine (I use a different terminal style for tabs I use for remote servers, so that I can recognise them at a glance) and in each tab I run a byobu session with many windows. I also use & when I want to open a file from a terminal window without tying it up, but note that this does not by itself make the process independent from the terminal. It only puts it in the background.  Also,   Your window manager of choice probably has a way of launching arbitrary processes which is not tied to a terminal.  For example, in Fluxbox alt+f2 brings up a prompt for this. If all you want to do is run a program or open a file, that is a better strategy than launching an otherwise useless terminal first.   Edit: also, have a look at this thread. You can use nohup to detach a process from a terminal completely.  Edit2: but if you read on, apparently it's not foolproof.  There's some discussion in the thread about the technical reasons behind a terminal's ""ownership"" of its launched processes that you may find interesting."

If you're either on the network or the subnet's router won't change, then you're not going to lose connectivity. Having an ""incorrect"" subnet mask isn't going to impact communication with hosts inside the smaller subnet (obviously connectivity in the new larger 128 addresses won't work).  Each distro does networking differently, so which files you need to change vary. Go ahead and make the switch configuration change. You can use sed to change the mask, restart the connection using the distro's network tools, and you're done. It shouldn't impact SSH connections either because SSH has reconnect functionality, and so long as the distro's connection restart tools complete relatively quickly, the connection will reestablish."

I have tried all the aformentioned ways of dual booting chromeos and a full linux distro. I currently use crouton to dualboot ubuntu with xfce and chromeos. This is nice because chromeos is very well optimized and had great battery life but there are many things it cannot do and if I need to do something chromeos is incapable of doing, I boot into ubuntu through crouton. Using crouton you can instantly switch back and forth between the full distro and chromeos. This is incredibly easy to set up as well. The downside is that only certain distros are supported at this time.   You can also dual boot in a more traditional way through Chrubuntu or by enabling SeaBIOS. This requires a full reboot to switch back and forth and uses more drive space. You can also just delete chromeos and install a full linux distro.  The biggest downsides to the c720 are the low quality and small screen, the trackpad which is not great, and the keyboard which is not great. The SSD it ships with is also very small but this can be upgraded pretty easily. I have the variant with a celeron and four gigs of ram and have had no troubles with it.

Possibly due to version mismatch. i.e grub is booting one kernel and the modules you have installed (or are being loaded) are for another kernel.   To get to a command line edit the grub menu item and add init=/bin/sh This will boot you into a shell. So you can look around and change things.

linuxquestions,3dy5bb,mistralol,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:41 2015 UTC,just change largeFile to <largeFile   That'd still be stdin.

The latest stable kernel version is 4.1.2 (June 2015), which you can always install manually if you need it. Or, if your hardware is much older, you could use an earlier kernel like the 2.6.32 (Dec 2009), which is still receiving support until later this year.  You're not really limited by the distro you choose, but you'll lose the guarantee of Debian's tested stability if you change its defaults packages."

linuxquestions,3dsbp3,altiris28048,11,Sat Jul 18 23:57:19 2015 UTC,"Not updating a box is a temptation that leads to the dark side. A box behind a firewall is probably pretty safe as long as it never tries to connect to the outside world, and your router never gets compromised, and none of the other computers on your lan ever get compromised, and no-one you don't trust ever connects directly to the inside of your lan, and you never decide to reconfigure your setup. Updates may be a hassle, but an un-updated box is a extra risk that you don't need to take.  I especially wouldn't recommend not updating an Arch box. Arch gets very frequent updates and kind of assumes that you're going to stay on top of them. If you ever try to install something on a box that hasn't be updated for a couple of months then you're reasonably likely to break something. Also, updates on Arch become more difficult the less frequent they are. It's just part of being a rolling release distro.  You could switch to a distro that has a more stable release cycle and has a concept of security-only updates. You mention slackware, which might work well.  The other option is to make updating your Pi less of a hassle. Have it download the updates automatically and email you every week or so if there're updates to do. Write some scripts that you can run that will SSH into the Pi and do the update for you without you having to type everything out every time.

Think about a swap partition that's a little larger than your RAM size, to allow hibernation, etc.  Think about 30-50 gigs per user for the /home partition. It doesn't need to be larger than that as you need somewhere else to store your long-term stuff like music, videos, photos, etc. that won't get accidentally killed by a mistake you make in your /home directory.  Think about all the rest of your drive for that long term storage. That can be mounted on a mount-point called /mystuff, /media, /junk, or any other name you might feel like.

Even if it claims it is only an upgrade, or that you are able to install beside your current installation, do so. Installing an OS requires modifying your current filesystem, which means data could be lost. Better to be safe than sorry.  Next, check for drivers for your hardware. This is particularly important for AMD or Nvidia GPU drivers, but also equally important for network cards (so you can actually get anything else you might need later on). If you will need to manually install network drivers, download those before you reinstall and put them on a flash drive. It will save you a headache.

By default you'll probably be using the opensource drivers, which work fine but aren't best performance for gaming.

linuxquestions,3dpg7r,kn33,14,Sat Jul 18 04:36:28 2015 UTC,"For Fedora, Nvidia is bad. That said, I bet Fedora 21 will work better for you assuming youre in Fedora 22.  I kinda do suggest you go to Ubuntu. But I want to make sure you know why it's bad. Keep in mind, I am a Fedora user with an AMD card and an Intel card in my laptop--so I am not very familiar with your specific situation...with that said:  Fedora is well known for being quite bleeding edge and pretty fairly stock from upstream. That means that if you want to use the latest and greatest of Open Source Software, but don't want to deal with a rolling distro like Arch, Fedora is probably your distro. They don't ship any patent-encumbered bits for the most part, which is cool too if you again dig Open Source Software.  Binary, proprietary drivers are shit. It's not because they don't perform well (they do!), it's because the kernel development (where the driver lives or interacts with) is faster than the proprietary companies can respond. AMD is actually worse with this regard. We haven't been able to use AMD drivers since Fedora 19.  Here's why Nvidia drivers are extra bad in Fedora 22 at the moment. There exist open source drivers in the kernel. The kernel is actually made up of a lot of drivers. Intel's official drivers are open source and in the kernel. With Intel, your video card works out of the box at full speed. Kinda cool.  With AMD, AMD is supporting the open source, kernel driver to a degree now with paid developer(s). It's not the official driver, and it's not as feature-ful or fast as the proprietary AMD driver--but it's semi-official and relatively good.  Nvidia...Nvidia has not been nearly as friendly to their Open Source driver. They aren't hostile and offer some help, they just don't view it as a priority as Intel and even AMD do. The Nvidia open source, community-led effort is called Nouveau.  So, with Fedora 22 shipping with a bleeding-edge, aka very new, kernel and xorg (video) stack, it means that for the time being the Nvidia proprietary drivers are unable to work. Eventually Nvidia will release a new driver that will work with Fedora 22...but then Fedora 23 will likely be out. And unlike us AMD and Intel users, you don't have a good fallback to go to in Nouveau.  It is likely Fedora 21 will work for you because it's slightly older, but I can't guarantee that.  Ubuntu uses a slightly older kernel generally, and AMD and Nvidia generally target Ubuntu first with their driver releases. On top of that, Ubuntu LTS uses a much older kernel for a much longer time. They have a different set of goals than Fedora so it attracts different userbases.  Again, I am a Fedora user and I love it. It's made some mistakes in the past, but it lets me always see what's shaking in Open Source. Some of the most ubiquitous Linux tooling has been born of Fedora and Red Hat before. It's a very sane and accessible distro comparatively. It gives power users no blocks to being powerful while still being relatively easy to get rolling."

For example, having a newer kernel is almost always an improvement in hardware support, and Fedora versions get the newest stable ones for most of their support lifetime. Even Ubuntu started to do the same thing with their hardware enablement (IIRC) updates for LTS versions.   Newer versions of desktop environments have lots of improvements in usability, supported software, etc, and Fedora almost always has them. If you pick up a Fedora Live CD everything will work beautifully out of the box, likely better than other distributions with the same DE but older versions. The ugly part is getting things like Flash, proprietary drivers, etc, but that isn't due to the bleeding edge, but how Fedora structures itself and doesn't ship non-free software."

linuxquestions,3dpg7r,nhasian,4,Sat Jul 18 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"So sad to see such misinformation in this thread. I can only assume everyone commenting is simply guessing, and getting wrong, because the NVIDIA drivers do work on Fedora just fine. NVIDIA drivers pretty much never lag X.org versions. Don't assume the same applies because it happens with AMD's fglrx. Kernel incompatibilities happen but are rare, and at the moment there are none, and the latest NVIDIA driver (352.51) works perfectly with kernel 4.0.  It seems the issue you are experiencing is that the Ubuntu driver installer automatically figured out you need not only the NVIDIA drivers, but Bumblebee for switchable graphics. So installing only the drivers would not help, since something needs to actually activate the NVIDIA GPU, and possibly keep the Intel GPU working as well if it is needed to forward the actual video signal to the outputs.  The instructions on the Fedora Wiki should be enough for installing Bumblebee with the proprietary drivers. It's admittedly not as convenient as Ubuntu, but far from impossible or broken as other comments have mistakenly said. There is absolutely no need to revert to Fedora 21. The only thing I'd change from the instructions is not installing the big list of dependencies manually: it is not necessary, as the packages will correctly pull them automatically. Something like the following should be sufficient:  sudo rpm -i http://install.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/yum/itecs/public/bumblebee/fedora22/noarch/bumblebee-release-1.2-1.noarch.rpm sudo rpm -i http://install.linux.ncsu.edu/pub/yum/itecs/public/bumblebee-nonfree/fedora22/noarch/bumblebee-nonfree-release-1.2-1.noarch.rpm sudo dnf install bbswitch bumblebee-nvidia primus primus.i686   Also to the people saying that Fedora isn't suitable for desktops: it can be true for non-technical users, and Ubuntu does much better in this regard, but adding a repository and installing a package is really all it takes to get most things missing in the default installation including the NVIDIA drivers. There is no manual configuration or nothing of the sort, and it's not that much different from most other distributions like Debian. And you get the benefit of actually having up-to-date packages, which in the case of drivers is quite important. Ubuntu with the xorg-edgers PPA is way more broken than Fedora ever is.  TL; DR: Install bumblebee, everything should work fine. Do not revert to F21 because of this, anyone telling you to do that has no idea what they are talking about."

Personally I ran into something similar where my old Nvidia card would just not run correctly using the binary drivers on occasion after a kernel update.  I got very tired of fighting with it and have been running the nouveau drivers without issue since.  Anyone telling you that you can't use Fedora as your home  OS is either lying or misinformed.  I've been using it for a couple years now and it does everything I want.  Is it better suited for a workstation? Sure? But that's sort of like saying you can't use Ubuntu in an office setting.

For all I know xsessions is a file called by some display managers, for example GDM or KDM. I am using slim wich runs ~/.xinitrc directly, something my .xsession file would do eventually.   I think it is important to understand that your .xsessions file and your /usr/share/xsessions/ are different. All my files in there are .desktop files that mainly give my .xinitrc (I think .xsessions is interchangeable here) information on what I try to execute, what it's name is or the description and that sort of stuff. With that information you can start your window manager and start some autostart-scripts or config-scripts.

There is a more serious risk with unencrypted swap space, because that might include sensitive data like passwords or encryption keys that were never explicitly written to disk at all.

You move your mouse pointer to the absolute top-right corner (of the screen)...Click and... In your setup, nothing happens because there's a space between the close button and the screen border and the button isn't actually pressed.   Here is the thing though, on MY setup (XFCE too ofc), doing the exact same thing works exactly like you want.   It works on my setup because of the theme. Themes manage the position, size and style of the title bar and the buttons next to it. IIRC the one that should interest you is in Settings > Window Manager > Style. Mine is set to Default but Xubuntu is probably on Numix or Greybird, so try Default too.  You'll notice that the icons and size of the buttons change, and it does affect the space between the button and the right border.    Eventually you can edit the theme by hand to customize exactly what you want if the default one isn't to your tastes."

Granted, there will inevitably be some packages that are not at the newest release available online. This is because your repository doesn't support the newer version, for whatever reason they have.

So you can't do a 5 disk ""raid1"" of disks with ZFS, the way you can with btrfs.  (Btrfs can even pull this off with mismatched disks - for example, a btrfs-raid1 consisting of a 6T disk, a 4T disk, a 3T disk, a 2T disk, and a 1T disk really will have a usable capacity of 8T.)"

Here is the possibility matrix when two drives fail:    Failures Array Status    A,B Failed   A,C Working   A,D Working   B,C Working   B,D Working   C,D Failed    Now the same for a 4-drive RAID1:    Failures Array Status    A,B Failed   A,C Failed   A,D Failed   B,C Failed   B,D Failed   C,D Failed    RAID10 does not guarantee being able to survive 2 failures (if they occur on the same RAID1 subarray), but it is able to handle many 2-drive failures.

Every attempt to do so ended up in btrfs completely murdering the IO on the system and rendering it unusable until the HDD got unplugged. Reading on the other side still worked fine. btrfs fsck couldn't find any problem with the filesystem and btrfs balance couldn't be run as it would kill the system. This was a week ago with the latest kernel and btrfs tools straight from git. So it's not exactly bullet proof yet.  I am still sticking with it, as it's featured are just to useful and as far as dataloss is concerned, so far the recovery worked reasonably well, better then with ext4, which just gave me a useless lost+found folder full with random filenames the last time I ran into trouble.

You are technically just performing a variable assignment. The shell doesn't care what the value of a variable is unless you actually use it.  In order to change the title, the terminal expects en escape sequence (Esc and Bell in this particular case) and not just some variable reassignment.  You certainly could create a function alias that sets the terminal title but there must be something that triggers the alias in the first place (a daemon, a task, a job, you) -- It does not happen automatically."

Quite often xrandr will report 60Hz for a screen that should be set at 59.5hz, or something else. I'm not sure how this value is actually detected or set, but you can use xrandr to change it manually.  One thing that I've found helps is using DVI. I don't think I've ever had a screen refresh rate detected properly through VGA, although I've seen a tear-free custom red-distro... which gave me the idea to try Fedora for my media client (I use Ubuntu 14.04 for everything else). I've been tear-free since.  My refresh-rate is reported correctly (59.5hz) in xrandr and I only suffer tearing on video in very specific scenarios. If I use OpenGL output in VLC, all is well. Kodi is also tear-free. HTML5 video does have tearing however, as does VLC in any other working mode.  The Gnome DE does not exhibit tearing when I drag windows around etc.  When I installed Fedora, I also knew that I could always fall back on a gnome-wayland session, which should always be tear-free. Gnome and Mutter seem to be doing the job however.  This is all on nouveu (default open source) drivers through a Geforce 210.  I don't know which component of Fedora21+ (haven't tried previous versions) eliminated tearing for me. It might be interesting to try out Gnome with Mutter and see how you fare."

The whole developer mode weirdness is a bit annoying, but overall using Crouton was pretty good. ChromeOS is also amazing with anything you'd do on Chrome normally. And the c720 is a nice little laptop as well. However if you're really trying to immerse yourself in linux, you'd be better off taking /u/pi3832v2's advice and getting a cheap old windows laptop, formatting it, and only using linux.

You remove the write-only screw, voiding your warranty, and then enter developer mode.

From there it's pretty much like any Linux install.

I don't think you have the same level of developer ""we all use this"" like you do on Windows because the Linux ecosystem is pretty varied. If I'm writing web apps there will be just as many people using Rails, Django, PHP, JS and so on. On the desktop side of things you probably have a fairly equal amount of people using Java, GTK or QT.  On the language front Jetbrains puts out a lot of very good IDEs for a lot of languages. Though for any given language you'll often see other open source IDEs that are just as good for that specific language.  Then many people skip using an IDE all together and instead just use a code editor like vim, emacs, sublime or atom. This works fairly well on Linux(and Mac) because it's fairly easy to work in the command line there. Also all code editors support pretty much every language so if you switch a lot from language to language they can be better to work with than going from IDE to IDE which will all work a bit differently."

Your website could take in the PDF, then run gpg --verify as above with the signature you created earlier to determine if it's been altered.

It has a completely different purpose.  At the core gettext is a way to substitute one string for another. The simplest cases are that you have a string ""Settings"" in your program encapsulated in a gettext call. With the help of your liguas settings (LC_*) gettext checks in text files now if there is a translation for that string...so if your system set to german and the tranlation files contain a ""Einstellungen"" for exactly that string this is what will be displayed.  Sounds simple at first...but afraid it's not. Well, yes...this simple case is simple ;) But language translation don't work like this. In the majority of cases a one-to-one translation of strings doesn't work. Take something like ""Processing file xyz.txt"" where xyz.txt is something that is set at runtime by the problem. In german that would be ""Die Datei xzy.txt wird bearbeitet""...the position of the parameter that the program has to set changes (gets even worse with more than one parameter that even can switch order in other languages). Gettext is meant to deal with such cases as well. And so far we didn't even get into any special cases like the english ""21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th"" (Other languages are not more sane there). Gettext is a tool to deal with such translation cases.

To do that, set the ip_forwarding kernel option. Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file so forwarding is enabled:  net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1   Then apply the changes to this file by executing the command:  sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf   If Raspbian does not have the sysctl command, you can just do this instead:  echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward   There is a question on StackExchange that talks about this a bit more:  http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14056/what-is-kernel-ip-forwarding  Also, this should be set as soon as the Raspberry Pi connects to the WiFi router, but the Raspberry Pi's default route should be the WiFi router.

linuxquestions,3d8ico,henry_kr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:39:45 2015 UTC,"A default gateway is exactly that, it's where packets are sent if a better match isn't found. e.g. for this setup:  $ ip route default via 10.2.5.1 dev eth0  10.2.5.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.2.5.43  192.168.33.0/24 dev vboxnet0  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.33.1  $    Traffic for 10.2.5.42 will go via eth0. Traffic for 192.168.33.100 will go via vboxnet0. Traffic for 8.8.8.8 will also go via eth0 and on to 10.2.5.1.  In your example you have to remember that the networks are segregated, you have two subnets. Only a machine with interfaces in both subnets can route to addresses in both without using a gateway. So unless 192.168.0.1 has another interface configured in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet it has no way of routing directly and must go through a gateway. Does that make sense?"
linuxquestions,3d8ico,henry_kr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:21:58 2015 UTC,"It does - what I'm wondering is whether the ""correct"" way to do things is to always let a default gateway figure out what to do, or to furnish clients with routing information (somehow) so that they only touch the default when needed - i.e. when they cannot access the target subnet's gateway.  If the gw for subnet B is on the same subnet as the client (on subnet A), it seems suboptimal to bother the default gw with that request."

linuxquestions,3d8i4i,ManusX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:01:15 2015 UTC,"Hey.  Ok. I am waiting for the client to arrive (they are running late) so if I abruptly stop responding for a bit I am earning my keep ;)  If you have never made a script this may be a bit tough for you to get your head around. Once you have cracked the ""how"" and the ""why"" you should be a for away.  (If any fellow greybeards read this, avert thine eyes, things may not follow best practice just yet.)  Let's get going.  In BASH (the command line shell for Linux) you have a bunch of tools that can help you do stuff. In fact, you can admin a whole system without never touching a mouse.  When I give you a command to run, I will do it like this:  command   So, assuming you can get to a terminal, type in:  date   This will give you the current system date and time. Similarly there are a bunch of other commands that you use in your day to day use of your admin tasks.  Things such as:  ls   List a bunch of files in the current directory  cp   Copy stuff  ping   If you have ever used the Windows command line to check if you can get to the Internet you may have used that one.  Lastly for now:  echo   ""echo"" does what it says on the tin. If you do  echo ""Hello""   the terminal will spit out ""Hello"" back at you.  You can play with these commands for a bit. Some of them will need arguments, and this is where you get to the meat of adding users. Remember ""arguments"" while we do this.  Arguments are things that tell some programs what you want them to do.  Last one before we start;  touch   ""touch"" allows you to make a blank or empty file. And for your first script we will play with a file you and I know won't break anything.  Touch needs an argument, (remember arguments?)  Try:  touch quintinzaisawesome   You may or may not see output, but if you do ""ls"" now, you should see a ""quintinzaisawesome"" file.  Try it, and you have now given a command an argument.  Next, remember our buddy ""cp""? It also needs arguments. Try:  cp quintinzaisawesome piranhaEUisawesome   You will now have two files by that name.  Do them and pat yourself on the back, you have now executed commands and passed arguments to them. This is key to understand when writing bash scripts. A script is a bunch of commands strung together with arguments passed to them either by a user or by the program itself.  Now, here is the next step. To write a script to manipulate commands, you will need to be able to edit text files. For now you can use nano (most Linux distributions will have it) and it is a very simple text editor.  If you do not want to write this script in the command line and prefer a gui you can go with gedit or your editor of choice. For now I suggest you stay away from sublime text if you are just dipping them toes into the basics of scripting. I want you to focus on what you are doing, and not the program you are using.  OK, I have to run quick, so get back to me with questions about this and let me know if you have your text editor ready.  Later when I get home we can build our first script.  Cheers man, don't get disheartened by the comments here, we all started somewhere and you will probably struggle a bit in the beginning."
linuxquestions,3d8i4i,phre4k,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:20:14 2015 UTC,"Hello, thanks for the help! I am finding this really hard. Would it be possible for you to build this for me please? Is this a script?   #!/bin/bash  cd $HOME  echo ""foo"" >> bar.txt  cat bar.txt"
linuxquestions,3d8i4i,ManusX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:34:15 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I was wondering what happened to you!  Ok, answers.  1 - You are welcome. I am glad to help.  2 -Nyet. I am not going to build it for you. (I would love helping you to do it yourself though.)  3 - That is a script, and we can start with that.  Let's break that down for you:  #!/bin/bash   This is colloquially known as the ""shebang"", and tells the script what program should interpret (run) it.  cd $HOME   This is your first command in your script. Note the $ in front of HOME? This is a variable. Variables get ahead of ourselves a bit, but let's give it a quick shot since we will be using them later on. (EDIT: It was pointed out elsewhere that I missed that $HOME is an environment variable. More on that added below.)  A variable is a placeholder that refers to a value in your script that is either fixed in the script of from a value entered by a user.  A variable can be called many times, so you can have ""echo $HOME"" and ""cd $HOME"" and ""ls $HOME"" in many places in your script and they will all refer to the same value in the original value that is assigned to the variable.  In your example script $HOME will not work because there is no value assigned to it.  The correct way would be to do it like this (EDIT: If this were not an environment variable.):  HOME='/home/p1ranha_EU' cd $HOME   ""cd $HOME"" will then do ""cd /home/p1ranha_EU""  More on that later.  Now we get to one we discussed before, ""echo"".  echo ""foo"" >> bar.txt   Remember ""echo""? It echo's whatever you tell it to echo. ""foo"" here can be any text. You can say:  echo ""quintinza is helping me build a script""   and the terminal (or script) will output""  quintinza is helping me build a script   Now we get to those >> thingies. Those pipe your output to a file. In this case instead of echo putting ""foo"" in the terminal, it puts ""foo"" in a text file. One > overwrites everything that is in the text file, and >> ads your last echo to the end of the script. (IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH LOGGING STUFF LATER ON!)  Now we get to ""cat"". ""cat"" is a program that concatenates text files, or outputs their content to the terminal etc. In this use example ""cat bar.txt"" will just output the content of the text file.  In your script it would output ""foo"".  Let's fix that script quickly, and then I will tell you what your computer does with it.  The correct script would look like this:  #!/bin/bash HOME='/home/p1ranha_EU/ cd $HOME echo ""HELLO PIRANHA WE ARE A SCRIPT!"" >> bar.txt cat bar.txt   That script should run fine IF (and only if) your home directory is p1ranha_EU. Generally in most cases your home directory is the same as your username in Linux.  Here is what your computer does with this script when you run it:  #!/bin/bash   ok, this is a bash script, I will use bash to run it...  HOME='/home/p1ranha_EU/   ooh, this is important, I must remember what HOME is...  cd $HOME   Hrm, this is the important thing I needed to remember. Ok, let's change directory to the directory /home/p1ranha_EU...  echo ""HELLO PIRANHA WE ARE A SCRIPT!"" >> bar.txt   Ok, so I need to output ""HELLO PIRANHA WE ARE A SCRIPT!"" to a text file? Done!  cat bar.txt   You want me to look what is in that file? Ok! Here it is! ""HELLO PIRANHA WE ARE A SCRIPT!""  You will then get this output in your terminal window:  HELLO PIRANHA WE ARE A SCRIPT!   Before I leave you again for a bit to play with this, here is how you would make a script executable:  In a text editor, enter this script, and then save it as ""scriptlesson.sh""  (Remember where you saved it, I have spent too much time hunting down stuff I just coded right after I saved them....)  Open a terminal, navigate to the folder you have saved that script in and then run the following command:  chmod +x scriptlesson.sh   Now the script is executable and you can run it like so:  ./scriptlesson.sh   If you had not fixed your home directory it will fail, so make sure you have your home directory correct. You can test that by doing this:  cd   That will cd to your users /home directory, and then:  pwd   That stands for Present Working Directory. It will output your home directory address and you can input that in your script.  In my case that will be:  /home/quintinza   Good luck!  If you get this done we can move to the actual making of the user adding script. Be warned though that I am not going to give you a cookie cutter script to copy and paste in your assignment. When you have done the above I will show you how to read input from the terminal, and then you can use that to build a script to add users that I will crit for you before you send it in.  I am eager to help a new Linux guy or girl on the way to understanding what they need to know to work better, so let's see how we can make this work for you.  Cheers for now, I am going to relax a bit. (my next meeting is at 7pm my time, so I will check in after that.)"

linuxquestions,3d885i,Kaisuke,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:54:22 2015 UTC,"I use Yubikeys and I have to say that I swear by them. I have the all singing all dancing NFC version so I can use it with my phone.   once you get the Yubico libpam module installed, you can use it to authenticate alot of different services on your linux machine, I use mine for OpenVPN and OpenSSH auth. I team it up with my normal system password to make a long complex password that can only be used once, and it removes the risk of someone just brute forcing your password, and even if someone Man In The Middle attacks you and gets your system password, they still can't login because they need your yubikey also.  I would say though that if you are going to use this as a primary auth method for your only remote access method (like SSH for many VPS systems) setup public key authentication too, just so if you happen to lose or have your Yubikey stolen you can still login. I have yet to have any problems with Breaking any of my Yubikeys and looking at how they are made they should live if you accidentally put them though the wash!"

It generates a cryptographic key that is different but when hashed with a specific keyphrase, becomes the same password every time.   So if you have a password, you can encrypt it on a yubikey with a passphrase. And then use that to get into your computer or something like lastpass.   It's useful because if you ever lose the key, or the computer, someone could even know the password and not be able to get to your accounts because there's also a key phrase in the way.   Even if they knew the keyphrase AND the computer, AND the yubikey, they still can't decrypt the password without knowing the encryption algorithm.   So you've got this little key, that's safe with you as long as you know"

Additionally you may want to consider using sticky bit on some of those directories.   how different users can have different permission to the same file   Under traditional Linux permissions that's not possible. A file may only have one owner and one primary group; No exceptions.  As for not-so-traditional methods there's ACLs (access control lists) that allow you to add as many rules as you want to specific files and directories. ACLs can be used as an extension to existing permissions or as a way to effectively override them... or both."

I think I may be able to set this up just with users/groups.  One question, does ownership of a file inherently do anything?  e.g. if I chown a file user:group and chmod it 770. user can do nothing to the file if it is not in group?  Similarly, if a file is chown bob:bob and chmod 770. If I add user to group bob, user now has full permissions to that file?  Sorry if these are dumb questions, I've looked around for simple explanations of linux permissions to address this but haven't found exactly what I was looking for."

The owner does not necessarily have to belong to the group. That's why Unix (read: Linux) permissions have three parts: the user, the group and others, and each one of those has, in turn, three components: read, write, execute.  When you create a user in Linux the system automatically creates a group with the same name and sets it as your primary group.   if a file is chown bob:bob and chmod 0770. If I add user to group bob, user now has full permissions to that file?   Well, yes. But that is because ""bob"" is already the owner of the file --  You could chmod 0700 and the effective permissions for bob would be the same."

Network namespaces work by isolating processes to different ""views"" of the network stack. It's pretty simple.

You could also even do something like buy a Raspberry Pi, throw Arch on it, set up a permanent VPN and proxy mini-server on your network that way. Haven't tried a proxy server yet on my Pi 2, but I'm sure it'd work just fine.  If you end up using Polipo, just remember to disable the disk cache in your config!

Furthermore, it actually increases the chances of Valve discovering that you're using a VPN and banning you or simply the Steam client functioning incorrectly (for example, if it connects to a server that you didn't include in your static routes for some reason, that server will see your VPN IP while other servers will see another IP).  I used to use Steam through a VPN for a year or two and had no problems. Nowadays I almost never use Steam at all, though, because Humble Bundle and GOG are catching up to it. I don't think Valve cares that you use a VPN as long as you don't try to buy games cheaper pretending to be in another region or something like that.

A lot like Plex but performs about twice as well, because Plex is a fucking javamonster. Has DNLA support. Is probably what you're looking for.  Mediabrowser, like Plex, will go through your collection and build an interface that has movie posters, blurbs, etc etc. Very slick, easy to set up. HTML5 for everything so it will work on whatever. And it does stream to DNLA TV's, I believe that was one of the original project goals. It has since turned into a plex competitor.  You can probably stream to VLC with it but the web client is sweet, I wouldn't bother.  The reason you're not able to ""stream"" stuff by playing via VLC over a share is bandwidth problems, more than likely. It does work, even for blu-ray AVIs, but it only works if you have 60MB +, consistently, which is more than I can say for most home wireless networks. You may not need a media server at all if you upgrade to AC wireless or you plug everything in with cables.  DVD ISOs over a local share at full framerate is kinda asking a lot TBH. I don't think you'll be able to play those with any of the media server software listed here unless you transcode them anyway, and at that point they'll probably work OK over the share. You would be able to play and stream them with VLC though!   You could just build some scripts and a console / web client for VLC streams. i know that it has a web remote control built in already.

linuxquestions,3d6xu3,xiongchiamiov,2,Tue Jul 14 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, this happens to everyone.  Read this: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics  Git and Github are NOT the same thing.  Git is for creating local repositories. These are directories, that contain files, and Git keeps track of the history of those files. You make changes, then make a ""commit""; this is a ""history point"" for Git, and you can roll back to that point whenever you want. You keep making commits, and keep adding to the history, and git adds all this up to create the current state of the directory. This is the simplest way to use Git.  Github is a remote git repository for collaborating and sharing your work with others. Unless you give them money, everything you put there is public. You can ""push"" some or all of your work to Github where other people can easily download it, make changes, and then push those changes themselves. You can then ""pull"" from the Github repo, and you will have those changes on your local machine too. This is mainly a way for developers to work together on software, though people use it for other things too.  You can set up your own Git server that works the same as github, even with the fancy shmancy Web interface if you want (but you don't have to). This would be a good place to store backups of your local repositories. T  You don't want to upload your dot file to github. Well, maybe you do, but probably not. You want to use a local git repository to track changes to your dotfiles, so if you screw something up it's easy to go back. You might want to also push your local repositories to a git server that you control (or private Github account) for backup purposes."

linuxquestions,3d5qba,autowikibot,2,Mon Jul 13 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"Dd (Unix):       dd is a command-line utility for Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose primary purpose is to convert and copy files.   On Unix, device drivers for hardware (such as hard disks) and special device files (such as /dev/zero and /dev/random) appear in the file system just like normal files; dd can also read and/or write from/to these files, provided that function is implemented in their respective driver. As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive, and obtaining a fixed amount of random data. The dd program can also perform conversions on the data as it is copied, including byte order swapping and conversion to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC text encodings.   The name dd may be an allusion to the DD statement found in IBM's Job Control Language (JCL),  where the initials stand for ""Data Description.""  The command's syntax resembles the JCL statement more than it does other Unix commands, so the syntax may have been a joke.  Another explanation for the command's name is that ""cc"" (for ""convert and copy"", as in the command's description) was already taken by the C compiler.

linuxquestions,3d5ozj,CK_WD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"Hello suomyn0na!  Usually when resizing and modifying a partition in Windows, it has to remap where all the data can go, if something crashes in the middle of the process the data may be there, but the drive could not have a clue what's where.   Disk Management has some limitations when it comes to modifying partitions. So usually the best way to repartition, especially the OS partition, is to use a third party program for the aim and to have a back up, as almost every action that includes hard drive settings could be risky to the data on it.   So perhaps this is what you've encountered, the limitations of Disk Management. Another reason could be that there are immovable files contained in the space you want to shrink. Immovable files can be pagefile, hibernation file, MFT backup, etc.   My advice would be to create a system image then try again to shrink the volume.  Good luck!  CK_WD"

Just because you dont use something or just because you are too lazy to type what you want doesnt mean the option should be removed from others who DO take advantage of it.

linuxquestions,3d2cd5,KaptainMalik,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:10:39 2015 UTC,"Use this command to list file system type:  df -T   You still need to find the partition you want to mount on /dev/sdb.

You should be good to go as long as you don't run into a mountpoint problem via /etc/fstab not being setup for it yet.  You already have /mnt, but you'll want to make sure you have an additional line in your /etc/fstab with mountpoint details if you want to mount that drive regularly. I strongly recommend reading up on fstab here and fashioning a proper line for yourself accordingly. Done properly you won't need to bother specifying a file system type as your new fstab line will declare it for you. Additionally, fstab can allow the drive to automount when plugged in.  -edit- You may also need to chown/chgrp on /mnt so that you have permission to mount there as a regular user. I would recommend creating separate mountpoints (directories) within /mnt for different devices so that managing permissions and file systems of your mounted drives is easier."

It is simply a preconfigured jail that has Owncloud already installed and running.  You need to decide how you want your storage managed.  That is really the deciding factor.  Do you want ZFS support?  Do you want to use hardware raid?  Do you want to use MDraid?  What kind of hardware do you plan on running this on?  FreeNAS is pretty strict on it's requirements.

But don't think that because you have ZFS you don't need backup (not to insult but people don't think about it) Freenas would probably be quicker to setup. Ubuntu would have much lower hardware requirements and you can find guides to do everything you need to get all the stuff you want running and it would give you a massive insight into how things work and you never know when that might come in handy"

It's probably worth checking to see if onboard already has auto-hide functionality. If you haven't already, try testing to make sure gnome's keyboard autohides in BSPWM. If it does and you can't get onboard to do what you want, switching to it is an option.
