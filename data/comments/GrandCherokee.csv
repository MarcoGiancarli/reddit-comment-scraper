GrandCherokee,3e4v0x,prothid,3,Wed Jul 22 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more in terms of the future. As cars become more connected and the CAN bus is more exposed, this type of thing will occur more often.  The guys that did this can do it to any newer UConnect Chrysler.  When they did their network scan they kept finding targets, though left them alone. In their initial evaluation of potentially vulnerable systems Chrysler was not the only one on their radar, just the only one they pursued.  So, the vulnerability is there. I doubt these guys are the only ones interested in exploring it."

I'm running a 3.5"" lift on my ZJ with stock tires.    I'm probably going to get general grabber at 2 as they are probably the cheapest 31's I can find that are a reputable brand.  The general consensus from what I've read is that duratracs are just about the best tire to get but the amount of cash you have to spend is going to be the kicker.    Don't forget you may have to replace your trackbars and sway bar links with the lift.  I don't know what the threshold is on the wj's but I'd buy the extended parts."

Smoke at start up would indicate bad valve stem seals. Smoke under acceleration is typically bad piston rings. Smoke during coasting or decceleration again is usually valve stem seals.""  Also: double check that it's not as simple as a bad gasket leaking directly onto the exhaust. OR that you switched to a synthetic or something fancy like royal purple oil. Older engines with bad seals may allow these types of oil to leak where standard oils will leak less."
GrandCherokee,3dsky0,Anthraxgamer,2,Sun Jul 19 01:29:04 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd build my own, or find a friend that would be willing to help you. You can get a small welder, angle grinder, and materials for a bumper and have a fun project, as well as the potential to learn something along the way, for the same price as a front bumper prebuilt. Anything you buy from the states is going to have outrageous shipping costs, and there aren't many big name vendors in canada. If you are really wanting to buy one though, I would look at jeepforums vendor and for sale sections. You could shoot kolak an email, he might have some onsight to assist you. Hope this helps."

GrandCherokee,3dsky0,OWSIN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yah, unfortunately it costs like $250 for the materials and water cutting, and I'm not much for doing one on spec.  I'd help set you up to do it if you had the pieces and wanted to learn how, but it takes a few days to do.  I think I've seen guys that sell the same ones in the US.  Since you're in Vancouver, just set up an account at Hagen's of Blaine just across the border.  They'll receive it and hold it until you pop over the border to pick it up.  It'll fit in the back of your ZJ and then you just have to clear it at customs where they'll charge you the GST applicable when you show them the invoice.  Easy peasy.  I get stuff shipped to Hagen's all the time and my dad picks it up and brings it across for me, then drives out every month or so for a visit and drops it off.  Edit:  Haha, I just looked at the link you posted, and yes, that is the flatland4x4 plans with a stinger added.  It's a great bumper, you'll still have to do some modificiation to the front tubes to get it to slide in.  Basically widen the holes with a zip disc and clean it up.  Alternatively, find a welder in Van that will take the plans and weld up pieces you get cut for him.  Then buy a 7"" grinder with a flapper wheel and clean it up the way you want it.  Check Kijiji or put an ad in for someone that wants to do it for you at their house.  The one from Kevin's isn't even painted anyway I think.  Frankly, you could buy a Lincoln 180 MIG welder and do it yourself for the same price.  Then you have a bumper and a welder for the next one, or a rear bumper.  I've started on the rear one from the same site, but the plans aren't as precise as the front bumper so I've been modifying them with a zip disc as I go.  And once you've learned how to weld, you'll wonder how you did without it before."
GrandCherokee,3dsky0,McColorado,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:52 2015 UTC,"Also, if you do get this done, remove your evap canister off the bottom of the drivers front before you mount the bumper.

Lots of pics, measurements, even some plans inside these links:   2014 Front Bumper - Cost of Materials around 100$ 2015 Front Bumper - Cost of Materials around 300$ Rear bumper - Cost of Materials around 100$   The first bumper listed was made over about two weeks, working on it a few hours a night and on weekends, with nothing more than a grinder and welder. The other bumpers got a little more advanced, had access to a pipe bender, plasma cutter, etc, so they got a little more intricate and took a little longer to make."

So you properly swap a fan you would need to get a new ecu, steering pump,  fan, shroud, multi speed fan controller, a mounting solution and do all the wiring deletes/install.  That said you could get away wIth just deleting the fan and installing a new fan and shroud with a couple relays for fan speed. Then cap off the extra fittings on the pump and live with the MIL code.  I assume you want a different fab because of replacement cost? The hydro  fan (when functioning properly) is excellent.  It pulls more cfm than the electric and clutch fan combo that also came stock. Reply if you have other questions."

That said, start at the vacuum reservoir up front, making sure it is not damaged and that the lines are firmly attached. Then trace the lines up, checking connection points along the way. A common place for loss of suction is where the tubing connects to the cruise control actuator. In my case, a new heater core had been installed, and the vac. tube that runs through the firewall to the A/C control panel needed to be replaced. It was, of course, the last place I looked.

My dealer said the same to me when I got mine but I insisted on the package. I got mine in February so the Pickens were good, I was going to make them put the hitch on for free if they could not find one with the package.   Maybe look into a third party shop to do the hitch?  May save a couple of bucks but I'm not sure."
GrandCherokee,3dcdhs,mrniceguy421,2,Fri Jul 17 13:49:12 2015 UTC,"Haven't started talking numbers but I do want the dealer to install the hitch so that there is no question about the warranty just in case.

GrandCherokee,3czahj,fatty119,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:42:42 2015 UTC,That was my thought from looking at it although I don't think there is much of a need for the wires as my pads had nipples that stuck out and locked I to the calipers.  It would have been nice if the pads had been used regularly we wouldn't have the problems we do with the knuckles getting divets from the pads.

GrandCherokee,3cms99,lincoln-locked,12,Thu Jul 9 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what part of the country are you in?  I live in the rust belt and my WJ has spent its entire life in Michigan and Illinois, so it's seen a lot of road salt.  I owned a '97 ZJ Limited with the 5.2L engine for six years before buying my '04 Overland with the 4.7L HO about six years ago, so I'll try to cover both.  ZJ * The 5.9L Limited models are a bit nicer.  In addition to the larger displacement engine, they also came with a ""sound bar"" that mounted to the rear ceiling near the hatch and provided additional speakers.  The seats were also upgraded and cushier than the regular Limited seats, although quite a few people find them too cushy and prefer the regular Limited seats. * Avoid the 249 transfer case if you can.  This AWD transfer case is weaker than the 231/242 selective transfer cases and often has issues with the viscous coupler (VC) wearing out.  Alternately, you can buy one with a 249 and swap it out with a different transfer case from a junk yard. * Since the ZJs are 17-22 years old, quite a few of them have been mistreated over the years.  If it has been lifted, carefully check the quality of the lift job. * If possible, test drive it at speed (40-60 MPH) and aim for uneven roads (railroad tracks, pot holes, etc).  You're looking for ""death wobble"", a condition that occurs when the suspension is excessively worn.  This is greatly exacerbated on lifted ZJs.  Typically, the bigger the lift, the bigger the death wobble. * Check absolutely every electronic gadget.  The Limited models had quite a few of them, and they tend to be failure prone after ~20 years.  While I owned my ZJ, I lost a window regulator, the tape deck (hah!), the rear windshield wiper motor, a door lock motor, and the automatic headlight sensor.  Some of those were a real pain-in-the-ass to repair. * If the ZJ has a sunroof, check the headliner near the sunroof for water damage.  The drain for the sunroof can get plugged and the weatherstripping around the window can wear out, both of which can result in water getting into your Jeep. * 1993 and 1994 model years had rear drum brakes.  If you do your own work, do yourself a favor and buy a new model with disc brakes all the way around.  Drum brakes are a total PITA to replace.  WJ * Always spend the extra money to buy actual Mopar sensors and electronics.  You can often go third party on mechanical components, but the sensors and other electronic doodads are typically crap when bought third-party.  Some components, like the throttle position sensor (TPS) are more finicky than others. * The original Teves front calipers that shipped from 99 to April 2002 were crap and would cause rotor warpage.  Chrysler replaced these with Akebono calipers in the middle of the production year.  If the WJ was manufactured prior to May 2002, ensure the front calipers were replaced with the Akebono model.  I believe this was done under recall. * Some models of WJ use a hydraulic fan in conjunction with an electric fan, others use only the electric fan.  Ensure the electric fan runs and, if you've got the hydraulic fan, check out the condition of the power steering pump.  The water pumps on the 4.7 engines tends to be more failure prone too.  Try to get the engine up to temperature during the test drive and let the car idle for a while, and keep an eye on the engine temperature. * The throttle position sensor (TPS) and idle air controller (IAC) are both considered routine maintenance items on the WJ.  When you have the car running and the engine is warm, listen for a rough or variable idle.  Keep your eye on the tachometer.  If you experience a variable idle, plan on replacing both of them.  It cost me about $125 to do this a couple years ago. * Listen for a loud clunk from the rear end when test driving the car.  This indicates the ball joint beneath the rear control arm is worn out.  It is a cheap part, but an utter bitch to replace.    Generic * Check the oil dipstick and under the oil cap.  Check under the radiator cap and in the reservoir.  Ensure your oil looks like oil and the coolant looks like coolant, not a milkshake.  If coolant and oil are mixed, you've got a blown headgasket.  This applies to any engines you might run into. * If you're buying Mopar, check Amazon.com for parts.  Some dealers sell OEM parts on Amazon.com for quite a bit less than local dealerships. * Check out all gears on the transfer case (e.g. 4WD, 4LO, 2WD, etc).  Also make sure you try putting the vehicle in reverse to ensure the transmission is happy! * ZJs and WJs were both produced for six years and got a mid-model refresh between the third and fourth years.  You often get subtle improvements by buying a Jeep made near the end of the model's run.  For instance, the ZJs got quite a few interior updates for the 96 production year that looks much nicer than the 93-95 models. * Get underneath the car and check out the rust.  Take a close look at suspension components that can completely rust out, like control arms and shocks.  Also, take a close look at the frame.  If you see any complete rust penetration on the frame, run away! * While you're under the car, take a look at the bushings, boots, and other rubber components on the suspension.  These can be expensive and time-consuming to replace, and they're almost certainly worn out on a ZJ and probably in rough shape on a WJ unless the owner has replaced them in the past few years. * Both ZJs and WJs will last forever with routine maintenance.  It can be expensive to keep up with the maintenance schedule, but it's a lot cheaper than rebuilding an engine, transmission, or transfer case! * On both the ZJ and the WJ, pull a tight turn in both directions in a parking lot and listen for a whine and possibly a hopping sensation from the rear end.  This indicates the rear differential lubricant is low and the Jeep probably wasn't maintained very well.    That's all that comes to mind.  Sorry for writing the great American novel!  If you have any questions about either model, let me know!"

GrandCherokee,3cms99,ikidd,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"A couple points:   Unless you know the history and are really, really good at knowing what goes wrong with these, don't buy a lifted or oversized tired GC.  There's lots out there, grandpa driven, and too much can go bad from lifts, etc. 94s came with rear discs after early in the model year. If you're swapping out tcases from the wrecker, get the matching driveshafts with it just in case.  Also U-joints trump CVs on driveshafts and axleshafts.  Axleshafts are hot-swappable, but when I swapped to a U-joint DS, I had to get it cut down. WJ, 4.0L, avoid any with the 0331 casting of the cylinder head.   Another good headgasket test is to start the engine cold, and when the engine hits operating temperature, thermostat opens and coolant flows, watch for exhaust/big bubbles coming out of rad cap.  It will also probably warm up much faster than normal if there is an exhaust to coolant leak.  And I have Niner seats in my CJ7 and (obviously) my Niner.  Best seats by far are the leather ones I had in my 94 LTD.  Damn, they were plush.  I moved them into a 98 Laredo ZJ I gave to my dad after pulling the entire godawful mess of an interior.  Lucky bastard.  Very good writeup, though, thanks for posting!"
GrandCherokee,3cms99,ilikecarthings,3,Thu Jul 9 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"Both of these trucks are going to treat you just fine, they're solidly built, reliable and capable machines. The WJ is a little bit more refined, and tends to be a bit smoother ride. Not to mention, there were a lot of special edition packages you could have that gave you some pretty cool goodies. Solely based off age, you could probably find ZJs cheaper, but that isn't to say a nice WJ is expensive.    As I'm sure you know, the 4.0 will never steer you wrong. It's a solid engine and you can build it to survive longer than just about anything else on the vehicle. The 4.7 is kind of a hit or miss with people. I can imagine it's nice to have the power, as the 4.0 can be bit doggy, but the V8 isn't as robust. Just like any engine, as long as you take care of it, it'll take care of you.   With the WJ's you'll have a variety of Transfer Cases. Selec-Trac gives you the ability to disengage the front wheels, allowing marginally better MPGs, whereas the QD and QTII are full time AWD systems.   ""They (QD and QTII) both have the same traction control, but the QD has vari-lok axles front and rear. The QTII does not have a limited slip diff, but in low it will lock the front and rear together, but if tires slip on a smooth surface, it won't transfer the power to the tire with traction."" (-Turbonut via Jeepsunlimited)   If you're still on the fence, try one of each and you can make your own judgements about the drive-ability. I don't think you'll be disappointed with either in any form."
GrandCherokee,3cms99,benhop,3,Thu Jul 9 12:13:02 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much dead set on Selec-Trac because I want to take the Aussie out of my XJ and put it in the front of whatever I get. And I don't want the truck deciding when to engage 4wd.  My gf's WJ has a 4.0 and it provides plenty of power, but I also kind of want the D44 out back. Is there such a thing as a 4.0 with D44 and Selec-Trac? Everything I've seen that's V8 has had the full time only shit.  I don't plan on wheeling it as hard as I did the XJ, though, so maybe D35 with chromoly shafts would hold up. I could even leave it open and not go higher than 31s."
GrandCherokee,3cms99,benhop,3,Thu Jul 9 12:47:38 2015 UTC,"You can't get the 4.0 with a D44a but you can get a V8 with Selec-Trac in some Laredos.   Also remember, the D44a in the ZJ/WJs is not a standard D44. It has an aluminum center and shares zero parts with the regular D44."
GrandCherokee,3cms99,ikidd,3,Thu Jul 9 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did just find this.  The D44a allegedly holds up to 33s and 35s (it wasn't mentioned whether that's locked or open, probably open), but I'm probably not going to put anything larger than 33s on it. Most likely just 31s and probably keep the rear open.  If it's only marginally better than the D35, though, is it better to just have the D35 with chromo shafts?"
GrandCherokee,3cms99,ikidd,3,Thu Jul 9 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"It's a better axle, just a lot harder to find parts for.   It can handle 35""s locked if it has alloy shafts and been trussed."

I would take a lousy engine over a lousy body, because it's easy to fix engines.  Maybe not transmissions though."
GrandCherokee,3cms99,Username308,2,Thu Jul 9 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"The D44a (also known as 44HD) comes with very, very few locker options.  I think there are currently no lunchbox lockers, and there's one (Eaton I believe?) selectable.  Many or all of them came with Trash-locs, so you have that going for you, which is good.  But it will probably need to be re-clutchpacked, not a difficult job, just annoying.  Couple good JF threads on the process, involving large bolts and many washers, etc.  And yes, for some gods unknown reason, the 242 only came in Laredos for ZJ.  It's a straight bolton swap, but as I said in another comment, keep the driveshafts with it, you might need them, especially if you're replacing (shudder) CV shafts.  Because you really, really want to get rid of every piece of crap CV you can."
GrandCherokee,3cms99,macegr,2,Thu Jul 9 22:21:55 2015 UTC,"4.0L VS 4.7L The 4.0 is a very good engine and the 4.7 is a very good engine. The only thing is the 4.0 will take most abuse you throw at it but the 4.7 wont. The 4.7 has aluminum heads and a iron block, that means that the heads expand with temperature at a different rate than the block does, so if you ever overheat it, it will almost always blow a head gasket. Also if you dont change the oil in a 4.7 it will be prone to dropping valves.  For the WJ the earlier 4.0's had problems with the head cracking between Cylinder 3 and 4, not all of them crack like my 2000 which has 150K miles with the original. Here is some more information: http://www.naxja.org/forum/showthread.php?t=1076299  Some people have problems with piston skirts cracking or breaking off, but i dont think it happens very often. All of the issues here can be avoided if it was taken care of, except the 0331 head casting issue. Im super happy with my 2000 4.0L WJ :)"
GrandCherokee,3cms99,zluszcz,2,Thu Jul 9 22:09:06 2015 UTC,Too much reading but I have done the selectrac swap. Not very difficult with hand tools. I put a 242 in my 4.7 awd. And paid 80$ an Axel to match it to my config. If u use a 242 out of 6cyl u need to swap input shafts. Not difficult with some YouTube and forums. Go with late model 4.7 wj for power and watch ur coolant temp. Just my 2 cents
GrandCherokee,3cms99,Meta4X,2,Fri Jul 10 02:42:28 2015 UTC,"Be very skeptical of a slow radiator leak, my WJ developed electrolysis and started eating radiators. It's on the fourth now, after a couple 24 hour flushes, sacrificial anodes, and some overkill with ground straps."
GrandCherokee,3cms99,ikidd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:07:41 2015 UTC,As far as what I have read on people's opinions the 4.7L WJs are crap. You're safer with an 4L WJ... if you want a WJ. For the ZJ people seem to boast about the 5.9L and the 4L being excellent engines.   Inline engine design in general is excellent for endurance and reliability. V designs produce excellent power.

GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,Hip-pie,6,Tue Jul 7 16:52:00 2015 UTC,"The ZJ was a solid model.  Very well developed engine in the 4.0 and V8s, very little issues that way.    Transmissions: can be good or bad, depending on how they have been treated.  The 46RE behind the V8s is pretty hard to kill, and even the 42RE is good if treated well.  There was no manual in the NA market past 93, and I wouldn't get a 93, they were bad.  Engine: 4.0 can be rebuilt till the cows come home, but the V8 seems to last longer with less noises before needing a rebuild.  They get about the same MPG.  The 5.9 (98 only) is the holy grail in ZJs, all hail the glorious 5.9 and its heavenly rumble.  Transfer cases: try to stick to the Selectrac (NP242) or CommandTrac (NP231).  The Quadratrac AWD tcase (NP249) will probably need a new VC by now and will chirp on corners on dry pavement.  Most people swap out to the one of the others.  Rot: Rocker panels behind front wheels, and behind rear wheels up under the corners.  There's a flap behind the slats at the back side windows that if you don't wash towards the back, you get water in the body and it will rust in the back corners.  Also watch for rust at the pinch welds on the doors and back hatch along the bottom inside edge.  Other than that, yes, ZJ is the best J.  Please ask any questions you may have, and post pics of it in all it's glory when you have made it yours.  Edit: if you plan to offroad much, or lift it, etc. stick to ZJ or WJ (Pre 2006).  There is very little available for the WKs as they have front independent suspension and while you can make them offroad worthy, it's a very, very expensive process.  As for reliability, well, you don't buy a jeep to not learn how to wrench."

GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,Timbo1986,5,Tue Jul 7 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"I love my 95 with a 4.0. Bought it 2012 with 100k miles and now at 135k. I have only had one major issue when I lost reverse. But been over a year and still runs like a champ. I'll get the trans done in August. Other than that, just usual maintenance."
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,Trust_nothing,3,Tue Jul 7 21:11:54 2015 UTC,Look at drivers and passenger door hindges. Mine rotted/broke out of the door and the previous owner broke the latch while trying to get the door to shut. Also there are some electrical issues with some.
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,hv_tester,2,Tue Jul 7 17:03:07 2015 UTC,"Electrical issues are more a WJ thing.  There are a couple things with the VIC on the ZJs, but I've not seen a lot of issues in the forums besides what you'd expect for a 20yo vehicle."
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,ikidd,2,Tue Jul 7 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"Biggest (and like you said, not many others) electrical issue with the ZJ are the door/hatch switches. The electrical contact can ""bounce"" after the door's locked, re-triggering the alarm and interior lights. You either get the alarm going off randomly, or the interior lights killing the batter. The common fix is to slam the door, or lift up while slamming, which leads to the hinge problems."
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,disgustipated,2,Wed Jul 8 01:43:31 2015 UTC,Or just pull the fuse for the courtesy lights and pull the switches themselves out. Much simpler than risking breaking the door.
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,PiratedTuba,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"I just spent six bucks at O'Reilly's and replaced it in 5 minutes.  Works like a champ.

GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,disgustipated,2,Wed Jul 8 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"I bought a 98 Laredo a few years ago, and honestly at this point I'd consider a 2004 model if I were you. The price difference shouldn't be too much. The WJ's are superior daily drivers imho. I love my ZJ, but at 17 years old she's starting to fall apart a bit. It's hard to justify 100's of dollars in repairs on a vehicle worth so little."
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,wratz,2,Tue Jul 7 22:21:01 2015 UTC,If you can do the work yourself its a sound investment.  I've had mine for a little over a year and done almost everything in the suspension as well as lifted it.  Ball joints tie rods steering damper drag link shocks springs spring isolators.  On any older vehicle a lot of this will be a problem.  I haven't had any of the more serious issues a lot of people have had like transmission and electrical.  The 4.0 is a very solid engine that will last a long time if the maintenance is done when it should.  Mine was one owner senior driven.  It felt right when I drove it the first time.  There are wj series grand Cherokees for a decent price out there that could also work well for you.  When I look for a car I don't limit myself to a particular model I look for the best bang for my buck and the ZJ was it for me.
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,HeadOfMax,2,Tue Jul 7 23:03:16 2015 UTC,"I've got a '96 Laredo with the 4.0L. Just crossed 177800 miles. Other than the basics like brakes, oil, and spark plugs, etc., I've only replaced the headliner and hub bearings. I need a new seat, and am working on that, but I've literally had no problems from her. I don't know what part of the country you're in, but anytime you buy a car that's nearly 20 years old, the first thing you need to look at is rust. Slide underneath and check it out. Make sure all the doors shut with proper gaps around them. After that, you really need to look at the tranny. Since all ZJ's came with auto trans, and most that you'd be looking at would be in the 150k+ mileage, you'll want to check that out thoroughly, because a new one of those will set you back more than the jeep itself. Most anything that breaks on a 4.0L (if you choose that over the V8) is easily repaired, and parts are cheap, but you'll want to check out the overall condition of it (compression, burning oil, etc.). Good luck!"
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,justy98,2,Wed Jul 8 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"Have owned an XJ, a WJ, and a ZJ as daily drivers over the last 10 years spending about $8 thousand total including repairs (not insurance).  If you are mechanically inclined even in the slightest bit, or wish to work on your own vehicle, I say buy an older one.  All models with the I6 are very reliable, currently driving my '98 zj with 175k on the body/trans and the motor is from my old '94 zj with 225k on it still running very strong as as DD / Trail rig.  The biggest things to watch out for when buying an older Jeep are Engine Knock, Slipping Transmission or Transfer Case, and Excessive Rust.  All other problems are minimal and can be fixed easily."
GrandCherokee,3cfzsb,redbaron4850,2,Wed Jul 8 06:06:47 2015 UTC,"A ZJ will never treat you wrong. You can repair it from the ground up at a scrap yard, and it'll teach you some valuable wrenching lessons. All very afford-ably."

GrandCherokee,3cfhpc,phoonie98,9,Tue Jul 7 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"With the altitude package, you're paying for looks. That's about it. I would personally recommend an overland over the altitude. Here are the features that make an overland much more appealing.   Overland  Heated and ventilated seats Upgraded sound system  Navigation LED daytime running lights  Front tow hooks Panoramic sunroof Remote start Advanced tech package (optional)   - contains automatic cruise control   - blind spot monitoring    - forward collision intervention.   You said it yourself, the altitude is basically a Laredo with upgraded bits. So do you care more about how your vehicle looks walking up to it or how it looks while you're driving it?  Keep in mind you can always plastidip all the chrome pieces on an overland. It's an incredibly simple process. Check out jeepgarage.org. They have a ton of discussions about the differences between trim levels and even how to plastidip all the parts of the vehicle."

If I drop it off with the paint, a shop near me will do it for 100. So probably 400 overall.   Maybe see what someone will charge if you drop it off sanded down. You need to get all the cleatcoat off to do it right. Honestly, I would do it this way just to make sure someone doesn't just scuff it up and paint over the bad clearcoat."

I bought my 1996 GC Laredo for 2500 or thereabouts a few years ago. It had a very well kept interior, immaculate exterior, all records for any work ever done on it, and when I bought it, about 115K miles.  Obviously, whenever you buy a car, you want to look at the miles, the condition of the vehicle, etc. I also check the fluids and such (bad looking/smelling tranny fluid is a good thing to check for). I always test drive with the radio off (a good stereo is easy to put in, and of little value, but a knocking engine can be much more expensive to fix). Drive it on the freeway and in traffic with stop lights. You need to test it in all conditions. It may have an issue at higher speeds or overheat easily in city driving. You need to know those kinds of issues before you settle on a fair deal.   Personally, I don't care for the newer jeeps (since the AMC motor went away, though I'm getting brought back with the talk of diesels and such), so I can't tell you much about what to look for specifically with those. I did check KBB based on the info you gave (and filled in blanks like location) and it said that the price is a little low if it's in great condition, high if it's in good condition for a private sale, which I'm assuming is the case.   Also, even if they say the price is firm, they're willing to take less! Happy hunting, and (hopefully) welcome to the world of jeep ownership."

It's also not a bad idea to get the vin number and look at the carfax. Things like multiple owners in a short time might mean there's something wrong. Also, knowing where the car has lived in it's life can give you ideas of other things to check.

GrandCherokee,3be7dd,fatty119,2,Sun Jun 28 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately my old phone died, and none of the photos of installing the other seats were able to be saved, so I'll explain the process.  For the back seats, you fold the seat bottoms down, and use a 15mm socket to unbolt them. For the seatbacks, you only undo the bolts on the door sides, and then pull them out through the doors. Installation is the reverse.  For the front, slide the seat all the way forward, then there are 2 caps you take off the bolts on the rear of the front seat track. I used a flathead screwdriver to pry them free. Then you slide the seat back, and remove the front bolts. They're all 15mm. Next, remove the headrest, and tilt it out the door, and disconnect the connector to the harness. It has a red lock slider on it, so be aware. Then installation is the reverse.  For the passenger side, its the same as the driver's, but there's no connector to disconnect. I did find a heated seat harness that I clipped off, and replaced with a pigtail connector from the Overland seat. For power and ground, my friend tapped into the power and ground on the driver's seat connector, separating the insulation, and wrapping the copper around it, then using professional electrical tape to protect it. It was routed under the carpet and wrapped as it went through everything to make it easier to fish through, and to protect it from chaffing. Then he just used crimp in connectors an heat shrink tubing to connect the pigtail connector to the vehicle's, and the new wiring.  Next up, I'm gonna get ahold of the heated seat switches, and enjoy that in the winter. I looked up the VIN for the Overland they came from, and did confirm the recalls for that had been performed."

I changed out my head unit already for a pioneer one off crutchfield, if you like I can get links to all the items but if you search your jeep on www.crutchfield.com you can find what fits and then look for those parts online elsewhere and find a better price is crutchfield isn't the cheapest."

GrandCherokee,3azxp4,WhataStrangeName,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:57:37 2015 UTC,"Did you wire the tweeters to the original tweeter wires? I am thinking of running a set of components off a new amp and using the crossover that came with them, the speakers might not be getting enough power so your low end might not be powerful enough whereas the tweeters are much smaller and easier to power"
GrandCherokee,3azxp4,themangeraaad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:17:32 2015 UTC,I'd definitely recommend an aftermarket amp.   The factory infinity amp takes the output from the head unit and modifies it to output to the stock speakers. In the factory setup the dash speakers are not actually tweeters but are full range speakers focusing on high frequencies while the door speakers are tasked with the bass/midbass frequencies; if you plugged the tweeters into the stock dash speaker locations that would likely explain your problems. Plugging the aftermarket speakers in to the stock amp will give mediocre results at best. I think you can add a capacitor and/or resistor across the tweeter terminals to improve sound quality but I'm not sure how well this option works since I never tried it myself (not to mention that if you do this you'll be lacking in mid-range frequencies since the door speakers will still only be producing midbass & bass frequencies and your dash speakers will only be giving you treble).  Currently I'm running a precision power 900.5 amp (which fits nicely under the rear seat) using line level converters spliced into my factory wiring. I ran new wires to each of the speakers (could have used the stock wiring but not as good as running new wires) and used the crossovers provided with the component speakers to wire the door speakers & the tweeters. I will say that running new speaker wire into the doors was a PITA with the connectors that Jeep uses to get electrical signals into the door... but it's definitely possible to drill said connectors to accommodate larger aftermarket speaker wire. I even left all my stock speaker connections in place in case I sell the Jeep and want to reinstall the factory speakers.  Sooner than later I'll be upgrading to an aftermarket head unit so I can run RCAs and ditch the high level converters but for now it sounds alright. I can also definitely tell that the stock head unit is reducing bass output as I increase the volume (which is expected with this head unit) and can also tell that the rf modulator I'm using is limiting the frequency range my stereo is playing so that's the other key benefit to replacing the stock head unit... but I've been running the stock head unit with aftermarket speakers/amp for easily 6+ months now and all things considered it does sound pretty good.
GrandCherokee,3azxp4,themangeraaad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm a wrench turner, not a wire wizz, so correct me if I'm wrong.   So the stock infinity amp wasn't meant to accommodate aftermarket, and that is the issue I'm having with the sound. By getting a new amp I could potentially use the wiring already in place to get the range of sound I'm looking for? Or is there more to it than swapping that out?  Sorry, this is the first time I've ever worked with a sound system, this is usually no go territory for me but I decided I'd give it a shot."
GrandCherokee,3azxp4,Suprfreak,2,Thu Jun 25 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"I'm at work now so my answer may be limited in scope due to time and a bit unclear since it's hard to explain some of this stuff via text. I can try to give a better answer later if you remind me (shoot me a PM tonight) but for now the answer to your question is both yes and no.  To start: the stock infinity amp has 4 input signals which come from your head unit (Right front, right left, rear front, rear left). Although it has 4 inputs, the amp has 6 outputs (the 4 door speakers plus the 2 dash speakers).   For the most part the stock head unit puts out the full frequency range through the 4 signals that go into your infinity amp. The amp then amplifies and processes these signals and outputs the following to your 6 speakers: 1) mid-high frequency signals to the dash speakers 2) midbass & bass frequency signals to the front door speakers 3) full range frequency signals to the rear door speakers (note: this last one may be wrong, rear doors may also only get bass... idk for sure).  If you plug tweeters into the stock speaker wires, you'll be getting sending both mid and high frequency audio to the (treble only) tweeter which can sound harsh and could even damage the tweeter. This is probably the issue you're having.  Adding a new amp could help. In order to add an aftermarket amp while using the stock head unit you'll need to use line level converters to convert your head unit outputs to RCA plugs. For my setup I just spliced into the head unit outputs under the rear seat right where they plugged into the factory amp. You'll also need to run new power & ground wires to the aftermarket amp since the OEM wiring won't be enough.  Anyway, on to wiring the speakers themselves. Most any aftermarket amp will have one output for every input. Remember I said the factory one has 4 inputs and 6 outputs? Well you don't have that anymore.   Rear speakers are easy to wire... you can just cut the connector off the rear speaker wires (where they plugged into the infinity amp) and run the rear speaker wires into the appropriate outputs on the new amp. Easy.   The front gets a bit more complicated. Here you have 2 outputs on your amp to power 4 speakers. In this case you'll need to run the amp's output for your front speakers into the crossover that came with your component speakers. Then the crossover has specific outputs for the door speakers & the tweeters (it sends the right bass/mid range frequencies to your door speaker and the treble to the tweeter).   This is why it's a yes & no answer. Yes you can use the factory wiring to some extent, but no it's not just a ""plug it in and play music"" type of installation. You will have to cut and maybe extend the factory wiring in order to install the component speakers' crossovers. You'll also have to run a separate wire to the tweeters but doing so isn't particularly hard since you'll probably want to install the crossover under the dash somewhere so it's just a short length of wire from the top of the dash to the bottom of the dash."

I ran 31's for  years happily on 2"" but then again I also ran  295's (33's) on stock height for a year and liked that.  On wj's anything over a 31 just comes down to trimming.

Theoretically at least.  Edit: I just looked on WJJEEPS and it looks like the Overland came with the Up Country Suspension package, which means you might already have a 1"" lift. If you were to throw another 2"" up there, I doubt you would have any problems with 32's."

GrandCherokee,3apqqk,SaucyRebel,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:39:03 2015 UTC,Most stabilizers are made to fit a variety of different vehicles. You have a bunch of extra hardware there that you won't need.   Since you wont be able to re-use most of the hardware from your jeep just try your best to bolt it up with the replacement harware to make it look as similar as you can to the stuff you took off.

Just use what you need to install it and don't worry about the extra parts.   It is a lot beefier than the original, and probably intended for a jeep with a lift running bigger tires. It takes a bit of extra effort to turn the wheel now, but not excessive. We still need to install a new track bar to tighten everything up a bit more (and hopefully get rid of death wobble), which may also help how it steers."

GrandCherokee,3aladd,BlizzardZHusky,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"Did you burp it off after you replaced everything? I also recall some advice given to me when I overhauled my ZJ's coolant system: Some thermostats have to be aligned properly to allow trapped air to pass by the thermostat during operation. Perhaps your thermostat isn't seated/aligned properly and is trapping gas/steam/etc during increased flow (higher RPM for hills) or decreased flow at idle.   I had consistent high temp issues through the tail end of this winter (in upstate NY), and I couldn't figure it out. I never saw any coolant leaking anywhere ever. I had inconsistent heating, so I figured my thermostat was screwy. While driving temps were workable, but idling was scary high. One day after a twelve hour day at work the ZJ overheated three minutes into the drive home. No leakage until it was on the flatbed. Turns out I had a double-ended leak from the radiator water boxes only when the system was hot and pressurized. I suggest renting or buying a cheap pressure tester to verify that you have no hidden or conditional leaks.  Hopefully something I said was useful, scattered as it is."

GrandCherokee,3aclpn,Jugrnot,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:15:40 2015 UTC,Have you checked ebay by chance? That Metra part number comes up $10usd shipped for me..
GrandCherokee,3abqs1,Moo-lissa,3,Thu Jun 18 20:27:50 2015 UTC,"Battery is easy. Buy a new one.  If you don't know how to do brakes and want to pay someone, it's expensive ($400+ is the going price around where I live).  I have no idea what a transmission fluid change costs (the process to replace the pan is identical).  rockauto.com has transmission pans for about $25 for your '99.  Both jobs on a WJ are really very simple. You just need tools and instructions.  I won't go into the instructions here. jeepforum.com and jeepsunlimited.com both have a massive amount of info including write-ups for common maintenance with pictures. YouTube has videos on this stuff.  I think it comes down to a desire to learn and get a little dirty or throw money at the problem and be done.  At 246k miles, I'd personally be looking at the cost of immediate maintenance (from the sound of it, even if you do it on your own you're looking at a couple hundred dollars) and the cost of likely future maintenance (even jeeps don't last forever) vs. your need for a reliable vehicle.  Finally, check the blue book for your vehicle. With mileage that high it's probably not worth too much. Though it'd be cheaper to do the work yourself right now, that money might be better spent on a down payment for something newer with less miles."
GrandCherokee,3abqs1,throwaway88vn321,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:43:59 2015 UTC,The battery is just dead from sitting there for forever. Its a brand new battery.   We have brakes bought and I might be able to do that one myself. But I'll look around where I live for prices.   The transmission pan wouldn't be too hard I feel.   YouTube has been my best friend on all of the instructions I've needed for past fixes lol.   You have a point. I'll look at the blue book and see how much I would be able to get vs how much I would spend fixing it. Thanks for the advice!
GrandCherokee,3abqs1,SaucyRebel,2,Fri Jun 19 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"/u/throwaway88vn321 gave some good advice, but I have a few questions.  How well maintained was the Jeep? I understand that its at 246k, but at that mileage your going to be constantly throwing money at it if you keep it. How rusty is it? regular oil changes?  What engine? l6 or V8?  Why is the transmission pan cracked? rust? hit a rock?  Any other issues? Tires in good shape?"
GrandCherokee,3abqs1,throwaway88vn321,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:23:42 2015 UTC,"We've taken really good care of it actually.  Has a few bumps. No rust as far as I can tell. Regular oil changes are definitely a thing. It has a v6 engine I believe.   Transmission pan: it's either cracked because my sister hit something, or because the last mechanic we took it to messed up and cracked the plate putting it back on. I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure it's the first one.   Everything is good. Tires are new. There's no ac and the check engine light is on which I have gotten checked but I can't remember what it was."

They are similar enough that the crankshaft can be dropped into the Jeep 4.0s of the 1990s. Since the AMC had a longer stroke but smaller bore than the 4.0, this increases the overall displacement to 4.5L. With appropriate supporting mods they'll makes as much torque as the V8s of the early 2000s.  It's an ancient design (obviously electronics have been updated), but indeed bulletproof."

GrandCherokee,3a5to3,WarMace,5,Wed Jun 17 13:36:18 2015 UTC,"Full-lock turning can generate extra pressure in your power steering system, which can then overflow and burn, or leak where it hadn't before ( potentially onto something hot!). Power steering fluid has a distinctive smell, so you shoukd be able to tell if this is the case.    When driving, turn the wheel until you hit the stop and then back it off an inch or two - you won't loose much of your turning radius. Don't hold it against the stop the whole time!  In theory, a well-adjusted steering system will hit the steering wheel travel stop before anything in the drivetrain limits out, but that may not be the case in yours.  In a parking lot, you're not going fast enough to cause tires to smoke, so I wouldn't worry about that."

GrandCherokee,3a6fb1,wolfiewolf,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:38:37 2015 UTC,If it's your head gasket you'll likely have water in your oil. Check your oil using your dipstick. Oil that has been contaminated with water has a milky appearance. That said I would suspect that you ran over a plastic bag or something and it stuck to part of your exhaust. Get under your vehicle and see if there is any evidence of a plastic bag or other road debris stuck to part of you exhaust.

Secondly, whenever I work on a car, I start with the simplest possible fix to make sure that it's not that. So, let's start there. Is the fluid in the power steering pump full?   Secondly, is it only when turning right, or is the same sound there for left turns too? Is it only when there is a hard turn or does it happen in soft turns as well? Does the steering wheel get harder to turn or does the jeep just make noise? Is there any jerking to the wheel?"

If you get all the rust down to bare metal then take it so a place that can weld and have them fill the hole and grind it flush. Then you prime and paint. If it's too rusted through, then you're  going to have to cut out all the rust and patch the hole with sheet metal. Probably something a good shop should do unless you are good with metal work or want to give it a shot and learn. Either way the longer you wait the worse it'll be. Good luck."

Make sure the radiator isn't leaking, they have problems with electrolysis...had to replace mine 4 times before getting it right (massive amounts of grounding straps).  With 180k, you might also expect to service some of the front suspension parts...sagging springs, worn tie rod ends, maybe a bad CV joint if they haven't been replaced already.

GrandCherokee,39rvd7,macegr,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:36:08 2015 UTC,The a/c compressor dries the air blowing through the system. In the PNW the benefit is the system does a much better job of defogging the windows with the a/c compressor on.  Check the HVAC controls to see if the airflow moves from floor to defrost to vent & to see if the temp moves from hot to cold. The air doors in the hvac system commonly break and it's something like 8 hours shop time to remove the dash to replace them.

If the belt tracked poorly, it could have jumped onto the pulley edge and cut these off.  Check that it's the correct width, not just that what's there looks fine.  That said, I've never seen that.  Otherwise, it just looks like a belt - rubber, embedded fiber, tears in long strips.  Could also be a strip of hose, or a blown tire?  Those would obviously not be yours, you'd notice that.  If it's not your belt, it's probably someone else's belt or, more likely, a chunk of one of the blown-out semi tires that litter the roads these days."

GrandCherokee,38h6tq,Sludwigw,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:37:21 2015 UTC,"I'll address this in order.    The 4.0 is a little shaky, at least mine is. But you also said for #2, it has a misfire. When a vehicle misfires, it causes the engine to shake more. It won't be as noticeable in an I6 as a V6 though. My old car had a V6 with a misfire, and my god, it was a violent shaking. Get the codes for the misfire. This will help determine the issue better. You use 4WD part time on surfaces with low traction, (ice, snow, mud, offroad), and it locks the transfer case, providing a 50/50 front to rear power split. You can use 4WD Full Time all the time. It is AWD, providing a 48/52 F/R power split. This is different from most other 4wD systems however. Make sure you read your owners manual. If you don't have one, buy one. My WJ makes a whining noise. Mine is my power steering pump, because the plastic reservoir is warped and leaking. If it gets louder when you turn the wheel with the vehicle on but not moving, its that. Have a friend turn the steering wheel while you listen to the engine. If it isn't that, check your differential fluids. The front is opened with a 1/2"" drive ratchet, just putting the square drive into the screw. A bit of oil should come out. If it doesn't, fill it with 75W-140 Synthetic gear oil until it starts to come out the fill hole, the put the plug back in as tight as it was. To check the rear, you pry a rubber plug off with a flathead screwdriver, and repeat the process, using the same oil. If the noise persists, take it to a mechanic. Painting the grille, tints, decals, headlights, taillights, interior lights, radio, speakers, small stuff like that. That's what I'm doing while I save for a lift. Check your shocks too. If they're bad, new ones will improve the ride and handling tremendously. With the 4.0, there isn't much in the Go Faster department, but a muffler would sound wicked good, but figure out which you want. Flowmaster 44s sound good outside, but according to their site, they drone a bit inside. Maybe a drop in K&N filter, and maybe a throttle body spacer would improve response.   Always shop Craigslist for deals too. I got a full set of Overland seats and center armrest for my Laredo for only $500. My seat was broken, and this was the best deal. Wheels from the 2007-Present (JK & JKU) Wranglers will fit your Jeep too, so keep an eye out.  I love my WJ, and I hope you enjoy yours as well!"
GrandCherokee,38h6tq,fatty119,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:22:51 2015 UTC,I kinda figured it was meant to shake a bit and hopefully the mechanic will be able to clear all of the problems up tomorrow.  Do you have any suggestions for good shocks? And thanks for clearing it all up for me.
GrandCherokee,38h6tq,fatty119,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:04:25 2015 UTC,"The best shocks are Bilsteins. But they're a lot of money if you intend to lift it any point soon. KYB are also extremely good, and quite a bit less.  No problem either! Also, check out http://www.wjjeeps.com"

GrandCherokee,38gwhm,SuckOnMyFreedom_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:14:11 2015 UTC,"I believe the ZJ was not a high pinion Dana30. That was on the XJ. Both V8 GCs used a Dana 44A rear end, and Dana 30 fronts. The 44a is also difficult to find lockers for.  The ZJ is a 4 link rear suspension, and the WJ is a 3 link. The 3 link is great for articulation and not binding, but it does have a weak spot, which is the A Arm ball joint.  The 5.2 in the ZJ is a great, reliable engine, not many issues from what I've seen. The 4.7 in the WJ is another story. You have yo be good to them. If they overheat, they're done. This is because they have an aluminum cylinder head on an iron block, which means 2 expansion rates when overheated. That kind of thing is why I got the 4.0 in mine.  As far as transfer cases are concerned, some V8 WJs had the NP242HD, and I assume some ZJs did too. Mostly the WJs had AWD though, and I think the ZJ is the same story. You can't put a standard 242 behind the V8, it has to be the 242HD.  If you're looking for one to mod, I think the ZJ has more available accessories like bumpers and such, and suspension options.  I drive a WJ, and I love it. I've driven ZJs, and I love em. Either way, you'll be happy."

Link  It applies equally to WJ and ZJ as both are bolt up mods, with the exception of potential driveshaft issues.  If you get a used tcase, take the shafts that come with it as well.  I swapped my front axle over to a u-joint setup last fall long after I did the tcase swap, and had to cut down my front shaft.  The ZJ v8 is rough on fuel, not so sure about the 4.7.  Especially so on the 5.9, but then mileage isn't your primary concern if you have one of those.  I think all 4.0L ZJ are D35C in back.  I offroaded with 33s on my 94 that had a 35 and never had an issue, but I don't get too aggressive with the gas except heavy mud.  One advantage to the 35C is you can find lockers for it.  Gearing on a 44a is expensive, and the selection of lockers is poor, I don't think there's a lunchbox locker of any sort for it, and you might only be able to get an ARB ($$) in selectable.  You can rebuild the Track-loks if you do get one, there's code on the pumpkin that will tell you if it's equipped. Most people that want a good rear for ZJ go with a Ford 8.8 from 90s Explorers.  You can swap in a D30HP, it's bolt up.  Try to find one out of a later year XJ, some came with ABS sensor and rings.  Keep the axleshafts from your old one, they can be used as spares.  Make note of the gear ratios, as they came pretty tall in the lower powered XJs."
GrandCherokee,38gwhm,ellevehc,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"Dont know too much about the WJ but I have a ZJ right now with an aussie locker. They DO make one for the 44a. It runs pretty well. But you need an open diff carrier. Some of the V8 zjs had limited slip but they arent very good. ZJ does have a bit better aftermarket, but the 5.2 I have in the ZJ is THIRSTY. I will eventually throw in an om617 diesel."
GrandCherokee,38gwhm,Username308,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:41:09 2015 UTC,I have a 1999 wj 4.7 and have done the tc swap twice. You can use the 242 out of a 4.0 but you need to swap the input shaft from original tc. Not very difficult. I did it in street in front of my house with hand tools. You will most likely have have your driveshafts altered to match new tc. If you can find a 242hd you won't have to change input shaft. Craftsman max access ratchets helped greatly in getting to bolts on top of tc while on wj

GrandCherokee,38a99i,EatSleepJeep,3,Wed Jun 3 03:54:27 2015 UTC,"Im guessing its the 3.7 V6? I would ask what work has done recently. Rust is not really much of an issue with the WK's but maintenance is a pain. If the starter is still original (which I doubt since they seem to blow every 50k miles) then I would think about switching it out, its a fairly easy fix yourself if you have a free day. Also make sure the tranny and dif fluids have been switched at least once. More important that the trans was flushed because after awhile it starts to ""kick"" when downshifting and thats no bueno. May also want to change the spark plugs on it if they are not original. Chrysler went crazy with some parts on the WK's and they last forever it seems. I changed my spark plugs at 80K and they looked practically brand new. Other than that, as long as basic maintenance has been done it seems like a steal. If none of this was done your looking at roughly $750 for tires, $400-500 for trans flush $150 for dif flush and $300-400 for the starter which is worth replacing from the start.   My WK is almost at 100k miles and I have had it since it had 40k and have done basic work and it runs perfectly. The only thing I recommend 100% of the way would be to buy a cai just because the stock air box is incredibly restrictive. By just putting one on I saw my city mpg's rise by 3 and highway by 2. Sorry for the rant but just trying to give as much info as possible."

GrandCherokee,37a27c,johnjay,1 point,Tue May 26 04:44:20 2015 UTC,"Mine kind of did what you are complaining of, clunking and the like when going over bumps.  Take it to a shop and get them looked at (the quote is free) it's an important part of your suspension. If they fail on the road your front wheels will displace on the top and bottom mounts and they'll result in very unpredictable behavior. I paid about $1100 for them to be done, I live in upstate ny and my gear is all rusty, totally worth not doing it myself. But if you want to do it yourself it's very simple, just time consuming and knuckle busting. Youtube videos abound for this fix."
GrandCherokee,37a27c,Shadowcat0909,1 point,Fri May 29 02:53:26 2015 UTC,Are your new springs secure in the perches? They might be jostling from one side to the other when you hit a  bump if they're the wrong size.
GrandCherokee,37a27c,Shadowcat0909,1 point,Tue May 26 02:58:51 2015 UTC,Just checked them and they look like they are seated in there well. I also grabbed them and shook them around a lot and didn't see any movement from them.
GrandCherokee,37a27c,ikidd,1 point,Tue May 26 03:33:31 2015 UTC,Did you check for any loose bolts when you were under there? Anything you forgot to tighten?
GrandCherokee,37a27c,wjjeeper,1 point,Tue May 26 03:45:59 2015 UTC,I'll have to check tomorrow morning. I'm pretty sure I got everything but it wouldn't hurt to check again. It feels like it's the driver side shock so I'm gonna go ahead and loosen that up and make sure it's seated well and everything so I'll check the other bolts then too.
GrandCherokee,378uvu,xKeyNin,5,Mon May 25 20:42:20 2015 UTC,"Well If you have had it that long then it probably could use new springs, spring isolators, shocks, tie rod ends, steering stabilizer, control arm bushings and probably ball joints too. Good news! A good lift kit will replace most of those items that are probably well worn anyways. And it shouldn't cost anymore than to replace it with OEM parts. Maybe even less."

GrandCherokee,378uvu,johnjay,1 point,Mon May 25 23:20:23 2015 UTC,Might as well. Any suspension parts that are failing Will let themselves be known.

If your rig is rusted (can punch through with your finger) along the main rails and/or where the suspension components fit to the chassis then you'll need to allow for some major body work along with the lift.

GrandCherokee,373rre,ZombieNation,3,Sun May 24 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"Towing with unibody vehicles has always scared me since it's literally sheet metal holding the whole thing together. The 04 Durango has a full frame and the WJ does not. I do know that my mom tows horses (1 or 2 at a time, trailer + horses ~4000lbs) with her 94 ZJ 5.2 and it will pass people going uphill and stay at a legal speed (55 for towing here in cali), without a problem. Sketches me the fuck out whenever she does it but she never seems to have a problem.   I did tow her ZJ 80 miles home on a trailer with my 89 Ranger with the 4.0/M5OD swap and that shit was fucking SCARY, anything over 45mph and it would sway so bad I thought for sure I'd plant it in a guardrail. Trailer + jeep was about 6000lbs, truck weighs in at 3800lbs. Do what you want but if you're gonna be towing alot, I'd just get a big truck. For realsies."
GrandCherokee,373rre,manlyjames,1 point,Sun May 24 20:36:55 2015 UTC,"I definitely appreciate the input.  You're completely right about the full frame vs. Unibody.  I hadn't thought of that.  The problem I'm running into is the 4.7L Durango can't tow shit because it's the size and weight of a house.  I like the idea of the WJ because (if) when I reach my destination I could explore a little.  I'd like the 5.7L Durango if I could find one for a decent price, but everyone thinks the Hemi adds $3,000 to a sorry rusted out rig no matter how bad it is.  As for a Tahoe or Expedition, I'd just rather not.  Again, thanks for the input!"

GrandCherokee,373rre,-spartacus-,2,Thu May 28 04:48:19 2015 UTC,"Been doing the research on this as I'm working on doing some work on my WJ, getting a trailer, and moving.  From the things I've read is that the short wheelbase and general design of the WJ leads to issues pulling large things.  You can offset some of this by using anti-sway bars and load balancers.  As you noted you have Class IV hitch, but you also need to have transmission cooler and brake controller to run the brakes on the trailer.  While it may be rated for 30' and your trailer is 27', how tall or wide is it?  From what I've read having wider/taller trailers than the WJ can cause serious control issues (though they may be somewhat mitigated through anti-sway/load balancing) especially at higher speeds and windy environments.  I also doubt extra 5,500lbs is going to allow you to pass anyone and should you be driving two-lane head/head traffic wind pressure from oncoming semis might actually be an issue if your trailer is really that big (your trailer almost weighs as much as your WJ)."
GrandCherokee,373rre,hate_sf_hobos,1 point,Thu May 28 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"My current setup is a nice weight distribution hitch with a friction style anti sway brake.  I also use a Tekonsha proportional brake controller.  That whole setup will be moved from my Durango to the WJ if I get one.  I know my towing gear is good, but like you're saying, I'm most concerned about the size/weight of the trailer pushing the WJ around.  The wheelbase of a WJ is 10"" shorter than my Durango, that concerns me a little.  As for the trailer's size, it's 8' wide.  Frontal square footage is about 64 sqft, which is the max for the WJ according to their towing guide, however it is sloped quite drastically to reduce drag."
GrandCherokee,373rre,hate_sf_hobos,2,Thu May 28 18:59:16 2015 UTC,I know this thread is 8 days old but I really don't recommend a WJ to carry a '27 foot trailer. The 4.7 works great alone in the WJ but isn't the best for towing long trailers. Sounds like you're having trouble towing with the 4.7 in the Dakota and I've heard of Ram owners having trouble with the 4.7 not having enough power. The weight savings in the WJ to Dakota isn't going to be too significant. Sounds like you're into Mopars but if you want an SUV I'd look into an early '00 Tahoe with the 5.3L V8. Frame on on body construction and the LS series engines would make a good mid sized SUV tow vehicle. Good luck!

GrandCherokee,36ho7f,GranfatherGlock,4,Tue May 19 14:16:25 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean it's not bad. Take your jeep to a parts store and get the battery and charging system tested.  How long had it ran after you jumped it? It could be your jeep hadn't relearned the idle yet after the battery was drained dead. It might just take some time.
GrandCherokee,36ho7f,RedSocks157,3,Tue May 19 14:29:08 2015 UTC,Throttle position sensor maybe?
GrandCherokee,36ho7f,macegr,1 point,Tue May 19 14:38:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my 2000 has done this with a bad TPS. Sometimes you can get a few more months out of it by removing and spinning the shaft, tapping it on the workbench, etc. But they're cheap, so just replace it."
GrandCherokee,36ho7f,RedSocks157,1 point,Tue May 19 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"That's what I did. Mine was having an issue where it would hold high revs for no reason, but once I figured out the problem it was an easy fix."
GrandCherokee,36ho7f,wanna_meet_that_dad,2,Tue May 19 21:26:58 2015 UTC,I second the new battery or battery test. I bought my jeep a few years back and the battery was not even 6 months old. Jeep kept dying and I couldn't figure out why. Battery tests showed it was taking a charge but after a full charge it would fail. Swapped with a new one and no problems since. Can't hurt to check that possibility off the list.
GrandCherokee,36ho7f,ikidd,1 point,Wed May 20 12:45:58 2015 UTC,"What's weird is that it only has a problem when the engine speed is falling.  Like, when I take my foot of the gas, and the revs come down...they just keep going down to nothing.  Like it has momentum or something.  If it miraculously ""catches"" itself at 200rpm or so, it will bounce back up and be fine.  But most of the time, it can't seem to ""pull out of the dive.""  And this only happens when it's warm. I guess when it's cold, it runs at a higher idle anyway."
GrandCherokee,36ho7f,McColorado,2,Tue May 19 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"If new battery doesn't help, you might need to clean the Idle Air Control body and solenoid with some carb cleaner."

GrandCherokee,36gg51,xturmn8r,2,Tue May 19 04:55:57 2015 UTC,Think I found the answer after appx 5 minutes of google fu. http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f309/wk2-factory-side-roof-rails-1519422/  trailer hitch question still stands.
GrandCherokee,36gg51,papa_beard,1 point,Tue May 19 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"I have a 2012 WK2 Larado 4x4. I added a receiver hitch and quick plug wiring harness off amazon. I have prime so free shipping I got everything for like $150. It was the same brand as the store and saved me around a hundred bucks.  The hitch went on quick with just five bolts that are already there. I just slid under the Jeep with the hitch on my chest and lifted it up, not that heavy. The harness check before ordering but with mine they have a plug underneath ready you just pay extra for the end piece. Hope this helped.  Hitch  Wiring Harness  Edit: The hitch and harness was maybe fifteen minutes and that is with my six and three year old ""helping"" with install."
GrandCherokee,36gg51,icecoaster227,1 point,Thu May 21 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"I put a trailer hitch on mine and it wasn't terrible if you have a strong helper to hold the hitch up while you get some bolts in, but like anything else, I remember there being annoyances. I believe we had to put a Jack under the gas tank skid plate because the bolts for the hitch also hold the skid plate up. And the amount of rust I had to deal with made it a bit of a pain in the ass. But, all said and done, wasn't too bad if you do your research on the wiring and don't mind dealing with a headache or two. I would venture to guess it was about a 5 or 6 hour job for me if I remember correctly. Oh and I would recommend getting a factory hitch (can be found at the junkyard for cheap) because it tucks up nicely under the jeep. If you go that route, you'll have to do some cutting on the bumper cover to get it back on. You can buy the bezel for your bumper to make it look completely factory, but I didn't and I think it looks fine.  EDIT: Holy shit... I just realized you have a 2014 gc, not a 2004 like me. Apparently my eyes/brain don't work this late. Disregard everything I just told you."
GrandCherokee,36gg51,unodostreys,1 point,Tue May 19 06:36:41 2015 UTC,"You can buy an aftermarket hitch and use a universal wiring kit. But if you got the factory route the bumper does have to be cut, and the dealer will have to activate the trailer wiring harness. I just had the whole thing done by the dealer. when I bought my 15 and it cost me $600."
GrandCherokee,36gd30,gdx,1 point,Tue May 19 04:24:58 2015 UTC,"2013 is WK2, and all it means is that its the chassis from 2011-Present.  There are no aftermarket headlight options for the 2013 body style, so as far as a smoky look headlight, your only option is to do a VHT nightshade thing, which always looks uneven to me, or something like this, which is a substantially more even, and better looking product.  If you aren't willing to find and shill out around $700 for OEM projectors for the 2011-2013 style projector headlights, there's only one option for HIDs that I can say, with any faith, would be acceptable. It's this kit here, as it comes with a shield that reduces the glare that happens when you put HIDs into halogen reflector housings. Here is an install video of that kit, but on a Honda Element.  All that being said, you must check your state laws regarding lighting, because you could just become a massive target for police."
GrandCherokee,36gd30,fatty119,1 point,Tue May 19 16:19:21 2015 UTC,I have a 13 limited and I am trying to understand your ?- The headlights on that vehicle are HID....the daytime running lights are the old type.....and AFAIK the only real option you have to change the daytime runners is to go to the 14 LED variety that you said you didn't like.
GrandCherokee,36ey74,ibegross,4,Mon May 18 21:27:10 2015 UTC,Get super duper cheap liability insurance from the corniest company in town.  Don't get into an accident for 6 months or so.  After that go get a quote from a more reputable company and it will be reasonable.  When I was 16 (in 98) liability on a pickup truck was 125 ish a month which was high.  I'm also in Chicago and this was long ago.  I'm sure it will go down after you have insurance for a while.
GrandCherokee,36ey74,HeadOfMax,3,Mon May 18 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it really depends on what state you're in, how many tickets you've gotten (if any), age, and if the vehicle has been in any accidents.  I pay 130 a month for my 2002 WJ. I live pretty close to Detroit MI, so I have to actually pay a little more since I'm in a ""high risk"" area for car theft. I think it's pretty stupid. But I've heard that after you turn 26 your rate goes down. I have quite a few years to go until I can see that.   Edit: I should add that I am also on my parents plan so it brought my rate down too. Try to stay on your parents plan and just pay them monthly."

GrandCherokee,36ey74,dfowen6,2,Mon May 18 22:20:08 2015 UTC,"I pay $250/month with State Farm for 4 vehicles and 3 of which are on full coverage. My first 2001 WJ with the I6 is on liability and is like $27 a month. My second 2001 WJ with the V8 is on full coverage and is still only like $75 a month. My wife's Hemi WK is $68 a month for full coverage.   But then again I'm 27 and insured in northern Alabama. But still, I'd be calling around if I were you guys."
GrandCherokee,36ey74,hate_sf_hobos,2,Mon May 18 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"4x4s SUVs are more to insure than a 4 door economy car. They're vehicles that are larger in mass, top heavy, and tend to cause more damage in an accident. 4x4s are also viewed as an additional risk since they're more likely to be used in inclemental weather and perform off road travel.   If you're looking to save money on insurance look at mid sized sedans... Altima, Malibu, and Accord. And a word of advise that I wish someone told me at your age, do not buy a European car even if it sounds like a good deal. It will cost you in the long run. Good luck!"
GrandCherokee,36ey74,Nighthawke78,2,Mon May 18 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"Holy crap that's expensive. I insure 2 vehicles, one of which is a 2015 grand Cherokee summit. Both are full coverage. I pay 1600$ a year for both vehicles combined."
GrandCherokee,36ey74,prancing_anus_cheese,2,Mon May 18 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"Age, marital status bring insurance down a ton. Once your 26, married, it drops like mad. I think mine and my wife's dropped 80$ the month following my birthday.  Also, being a homeowner helps, most companies love that bundled shit.  250 a month is a tad high, but it will drop soon enough. Having a sportier car can cause a rate spike."

I have full coverage on my WJ, full coverage on my wife's minivan and life insurance for both my wife and I.  I pay $165/month."
GrandCherokee,36ey74,cleancutmover,2,Tue May 19 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"Depends what your liability limits are. In MA you have to have $20K/accident and $40K total liability. That will not pay for anything if you are at fault and get sued. I have $500K of liability to make sure there is money to pay for the car, lawyers, and possible settlements. I am 37, have a clean driving record, live in the city of Boston, and pay $190/month for EACH of my cars. Its expensive, but part of my job is driving a truck, and I have had multiple people hit my moving van on purpose to file a suit with my insurer. There are a lot of shitty people out there looking to get paid on your dime. Find coverage that will actually cover your ass in an emergency, and not just satisfy state limits."

GrandCherokee,35p3zt,cracknasty,2,Tue May 12 16:11:07 2015 UTC,Maybe a Wrangler?
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,deargodwhatamidoing,1 point,Tue May 12 11:24:58 2015 UTC,"Would a wrangler be better? I'm a little iffy on that because they are just too expensive for what they are. They're basically a pickup truck thats an SUV, but they cost twice as much.   I also need something with a lot of room because I have to transport a lot of stuff often."
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,GarrisonM011,2,Tue May 12 13:58:16 2015 UTC,"a wrangler is a great car, but I couldn't see myself recommending it to someone who isn't going to even take the top off, much less wheel. if it's in the budget, I would research some newer Grand Cherokees, i. e. WK or WK2s."
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,cleancutmover,1 point,Tue May 12 21:06:42 2015 UTC,"I love wheeling, but just not in this car. I'm in college right now, so I don't have an endless fund to replace breaking parts. I've been babying this car ever since I got it, but so far it has not payed off. I've spent more on this Jeep without wheeling it than I spent on my 95 Cherokee that I wheeled every weekend. It's getting very frustrating."

GrandCherokee,35p3zt,acc0919mc,1 point,Tue May 12 13:22:28 2015 UTC,127000 miles
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,acc0919mc,2,Tue May 12 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"I have the 04 GC Limited with the I6. When I researched the jeep it appears that around 120K miles the transmissions start acting up. So the replacement you did was on par with other jeeps in our category. Do you know how to check the CE codes by turning the key? Turn the key 3 times to turn the power on, not turn over the engine. On the 3rd time the codes will appear on your odometer. Write them down as they appear, and google them. You may be able to fix some of the problems yourself, or at least read up and educate yourself on what is going on. You have to assume with that many miles that money will be going to replace sensors, exhaust, starter, etc. I would find a good, reputable but affordable mechanic. I had a wrangler that had a problem every month. It sucked. But the mechanic I took it to was very affordable and quick with the work, which made it a lot less stressful."

GrandCherokee,35p3zt,justy98,2,Wed May 13 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"Not looking for friends are we? Probably wouldn't go to a vehicle specific sub full of GC and Jeep fans and ask them if all jeeps suck.  That being said, the answer is no. Pretty much all vehicles made after 2000-ish are good cars IF you take care of them. I'm sure there are plenty of 200K + miler jeeps out there.   Before and after buying a vehicle, go to some vehicle specific forums, head to the technical section and read up on common issues for that make/model/year. Then you'll know what to look for when buying used or diagnosing a potential issue."
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,Zombiesai,1 point,Tue May 12 13:39:10 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to see if everyone else has a lot of issues with their GC. I have had the Jeep about 6yrs, and it's in excellent condition. No rust, no squeaking, everything is clean and it runs great. To be honest it runs fine, but the check engine lights and everything else is what causes the need for repair. I just keep seeing issues pop up again and again."
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,justy98,2,Tue May 12 13:56:09 2015 UTC,Try jeep forum.com or similar and read up. Years of knowledge from drivers and mechanics an everything in between. Have fun reading.
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,Zombiesai,2,Tue May 12 13:58:37 2015 UTC,"What code is it throwing with your CEL? Mine pops on now and then and the code says it's the TPS. I haven't swapped it out yet and it turns off after three trips with no issue. Other than that, the only issues I've had on my 04 have been really minor, the thing is a tank."
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,Urtoo,1 point,Tue May 12 16:16:46 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. I know you were speaking generally, and not specifically about jeeps with the after 2000 comment, but I think jeeps are the exception to your comment. I own two great pre-2000 jeeps (87xj and 96zj), and frankly, would be very selective of which ones I purchased that were built after 2004. Once they started putting chrysler engines and transmissions in them, the quality has been poor. That's not to say they are all bad, but they certainly no longer maintain the reputation for quality and bullet-proof reliability that was a staple of the AMC jeeps. I'll probably get some downvotes for saying this, but it's something I've seen, and I think the financials are proof. The reason jeep is going through models (patriot, commander, liberty, etc. etc) so much, and especially trying to tap into their roots with old model names (cherokee, wagoneer, and renegade) is that their sales are slumping. Those models had high favorability and the newer models have not. Chrysler, in my opinion, has been slowly killing jeep by mismanaging it. At any rate, this should probably not be a reply to you specifically, but it's late and I just worked 14 hours, so maybe I should put down the keyboard and go to bed."
GrandCherokee,35p3zt,NothingI5True,1 point,Wed May 13 08:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of the 3.6L. Though I've heard good things about the 5.7L. I mainly don't like the 3.6L because I despised the fact that they stopped using the 4.0L. That was essentially the same engine used since the sixties. It's got good torque and is so much better for jeepin' and creepin' on the trail than any v6 can be. The inline design is perfect for trail needs. But, it's not as fuel efficient and good on the highway as the v6. That's one reason the change was made is that most jeeps weren't being used off the highway. Even the ones that were are only used off pavement for a small percentage of the time. I remember thinking the world had flipped upside down sometime in the mid '90s when I saw my first 2wd jeep. And please don't misunderstand me, I like the newer ones. I love the features and how they look. I'd sell my soul to have a new cherokee, with it's body and features sitting on my xj's powertrain.   A jeep's a jeep though. Owning one is like being part of an exclusive club. It doesn't take much money, but it does take the right person. There's a million cars I can't afford, but there's not any I'd rather have as my daily driver."

All I can really say is that the IRO Springs + Bilstein combo has a very nice ride. I go off road around 5-10 times a year for major trips, so most of my time is on pavement (although it is very poorly maintained pavement) and it rides very very nicely. Be sure to pair it up with some nice tires and you are set! I run 265/70/16 BFG Rugged Terrains, and they are very pleasant on road (They hum a little at 25MPH, but quiet down on the highway) and they impress everyone off road. Here's a picture!"

It's expensive but a lot of the wipes have alcohol in them that dry the seats out and do more damage than good. Bick is great for the leather and doesn't leave much residue which is great because you're going to sit on them. Kept my boots in great condition for the past 14yrs too. I use it on anything leather that I value
GrandCherokee,35hvif,pheen,1 point,Fri May 15 02:34:08 2015 UTC,"Almost all leather seats in cars these days have a clear protective coat on them, so you aren't really dealing with natural leather and any leather conditioning/dressing products used are pretty useless/temporary.

Pretty sure people were dumping them to avoid replacing the tranny. I have an 04 Limited and the only problem I have had is the front sway bar bushings actually freeze in the winter, and when you hit a bump it sounds like your jeep has bottomed out. Could not figure it out, replaced my motor and tranny mounts, then found a sub talking about the issue. A week later the temps went above freezing and the noise went away."
GrandCherokee,35i9mg,cleancutmover,2,Mon May 11 01:54:32 2015 UTC,"Transmission problems happen because of poor maintenance, throttle position sensors/speed sensors die, jeep gets sluggish (stops downshifting properly) people just push the pedal harder and cook the tranny.  As long as it's starting in 1st and not shifting early it'll be fine if these problems are fixed quickly when they show up.  I don't know what the hell is in ATF+4 but I can tell you that prolonged contact to non callused skin causes chemical burns."

GrandCherokee,350465,hatwearer777,10,Wed May 6 00:12:09 2015 UTC,Is there a good coolant leak?
GrandCherokee,350465,AlpineTG,5,Wed May 6 01:12:04 2015 UTC,Any coolant leak is bad because the system is pressurized. If it is just slowly leaking right now it will likely burst in the near future. I suggest you fix asap!
GrandCherokee,350465,thexbrothers,1 point,Wed May 6 01:37:43 2015 UTC,"Hehehe... nervous laugh  I definitely want to fix it asap, that's why I scrambled under the car last night to take the photos! I'm sure I could take a good look tonight after work, but I was hoping someone might know where this is coming from based on the photo?   Unless the leak is coming from above and simply dripping down on to that pipe."
GrandCherokee,350465,thexbrothers,1 point,Wed May 6 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"Ah I gotcha! I couldnt answer that for sure. My guess would be that it is coming from that hose, it does look like a coolant hose. That being said, I could not tell you for sure. I am sure someone else here will know though!"
GrandCherokee,350465,fatty119,1 point,Wed May 6 02:00:14 2015 UTC,I just had a look from above and it certainly looks like it. Now I just need to be sure what aluminium thing the rubber hose is stuck to. Hope it's just a sealing or clamp issue that I can repair Saturday morning
GrandCherokee,350465,fatty119,2,Wed May 6 09:33:22 2015 UTC,What year and motor is it? That'll help narrow the options. It looks like it's just a gasket though

GrandCherokee,350465,thexbrothers,2,Wed May 6 02:27:44 2015 UTC,"It looks like the thermostat housing gasket. Should be fairly cheap, but if you're going to do the gasket, do the thermostat as well.   Mine in my 04 with a 4.0 were recently replaced, and no issues now.  It being on the bottom is odd though, but I'm pretty sure that the 4.7 was like that. This website should help you out. Saved me a few times."
GrandCherokee,350465,BigTuna117,2,Wed May 6 03:00:55 2015 UTC,I have seen vehicles with the thermostat on the bottom...mind you never a jeep and I've never seen that engine before but it is possible.
GrandCherokee,350465,speedisavirus,1 point,Wed May 6 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"I think you are right. I've never played with a thermostat before but I'm keen to go get one from a wreckers this weekend.  Looks like this issue is kind of common, where the rubber hose can start to leak where it meets the aluminium.  Why would I change the thermostat when I could just use a gasket or sealant at the join?"
GrandCherokee,350465,speedisavirus,1 point,Wed May 6 09:36:03 2015 UTC,Just buy a new one of you replace the thermostat. It plus the new gasket should be under $10. After you get the housing off it should be as easy as just taking the old one out and wetting the new one in its place. No reason not to do it when it is so cheap and easy!
GrandCherokee,350465,OpenRoad,2,Wed May 6 10:56:08 2015 UTC,"I know for most places the gasket is included if you buy the thermo. I bought a new thermostat, new radiator hoses, and coolant, for less than $50 recently."

GrandCherokee,34srsx,Jeeping98,3,Mon May 4 06:36:42 2015 UTC,"I recently bought an 04 special edition with a 4 inch RCX lift on it. It had a horrible death wobble if you hit a bump at highway speed. After going through it at a friends shop, aligning it and adjusting the track bar it still had the death wobble. The jeep had all new front end parts when I bought it. Evidently the guy I got it from shotgunned the front end trying to fix it. I read that tire pressure could cause death wobble...so I though it was worth a shot. Lowered my tire pressure and it was gone. Maybe that might help."
GrandCherokee,34srsx,dragontat002,2,Mon May 4 07:07:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but that was the first thing I checked. When I got my tires put on, the front two had 45 PSI and the rear had 50 PSI I lowered all four down to 35 PSI. I couldn't believe how much air was put in them"
GrandCherokee,34srsx,dragontat002,2,Mon May 4 07:12:06 2015 UTC,Mine still did it at 35. I had to go down to 32 before it stopped. Another thing to look at is to make sure any bolt that has to do with steering or suspension is torqued to spec. Death wobble is a pain but if you study it long enough you'll find the cause.
GrandCherokee,34srsx,fatty119,1 point,Mon May 4 07:16:32 2015 UTC,I've already checked every single bolt on the power train and suspension. And I'll try dropping satire pressure to see if it helps. Cheers mate! I'll be making updates to this to say what works and what doesnt
GrandCherokee,34srsx,dfowen6,2,Mon May 4 07:45:23 2015 UTC,"See if you can get your tires road force balanced too, at the proper psi. The amount of air in the tire really messes with the balance sometimes."

GrandCherokee,34o51c,fatty119,0,Sun May 3 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"im not saying your wrong but from my research the amp only powers the rears, which makes sense since the fronts work. to anwser your qustion, i do not know what a pre amp out is, im not real knowledgeable. about the link, where would those plugs go in to?"
GrandCherokee,34o51c,fatty119,1 point,Sun May 3 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"The factory amp is a 6 channel amp, which powers all the speakers, the dash tweeters, front door speaker, and rear door speakers.   But on the back of your new head unit, there should be either 2, 4, or 6 RCA plugs. Those are the preamp outs. The connectors on that harness would plug into those in their respective locations, which would power all the speakers better. Mine doesn't have the infinity system, so I can't be 100% sure on anything. That's my best guess. Funny thing is, I installed a new head unit in my WJ, and the rear right speaker no longer works. Its always possible that somewhere we messed up on the wiring connection and it got loose."

GrandCherokee,34j8ek,entFOURlife,1 point,Fri May 1 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"Sticky valve or lifter. Pretty common, really. Looks like you're in for some top-end work. If you are the DIY type, you can clean them up somewhat by yourself, often doubling their life.   Here's an E-how about it, which covers the basics of what you'd want to do. You can research some mors on techniques for removing the cover if you want. Don't remove the cover outside - anything floating around or blowing in the wind will get in to your engine - no bueno.   You can also try Seafoam to clean your valves and lifters, sucking it in carefully through a vacuum tube. Again, search for methodology. Honestly, if you're going to go that route though, just use purified water instead of Seafoam. It'll steam clean the parts in question, and is way less harmful to the environment. Hell, might even be more effective.   If you're not the DIY type, well, just ask a shop to do this for you. If you bring it to them without ideas, they're just going to want to replace it all."
GrandCherokee,34j8ek,Eclectophile,1 point,Fri May 1 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"Um, purified water? In your engine somewhere other than the coolant? No thank you! Seafoam is a fine product, mostly diesel fuel, and it will mix with and dissolve whatever oily substance is caking the lifters or valves."

GrandCherokee,34cxxf,BravoTeam127,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:26:04 2015 UTC,"The up country has a two inch lift, right?   I would say go for the 265/70r16. It's an awesome size that's very similar to the 31x10.5. It's an awesome tire because it gives you the width and traction to pull out of a sticky situation. The 245/75r16 is the same height, but it doesn't have the width that will give you the extra pull.   I've got a set of Big O Big Foot A/T in the 265/70r16 size on my WJ Laredo with a 2"" budget boost and they are awesome! I highly recommend them. A lot traction in all terrains and weather. They've been great in the snow, they crawl through the mud no problem, and they are nice on the street and don't make a lot of noise."
GrandCherokee,34cxxf,BravoTeam127,2,Thu Apr 30 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"it's tough to say how much the Up Country Suspension Group really gives   Utilizing upgraded shocks, springs and tires, the UC package claims to give about 1"" of additional lift, with a slightly firmer and steadier ride. However, there seems to be a variety of different springs that have been used for this option, with some owners claiming only 5/8"" of lift while others have stated higher.   So it would be tough to see if a 265 would really fit: also this is mostly a DD that sees some light trails, and will be my tow vehicle, so a lift isn't happening as of yet"
GrandCherokee,34cxxf,fatty119,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:55:40 2015 UTC,"Well there is essentially a .1 inch difference between the 265 and 245 for heighth, so you'd either be good with either or neither."
GrandCherokee,34cl5a,yacadelic,3,Thu Apr 30 01:48:48 2015 UTC,"If the tires fill up the wheel well, you lose some articulation, but it looks better than small tires.  As far as the size, according to Superlift, you'll be able to get 34"" tires max with a 4"" lift on a WK. I can't say from experience, as right now I drive a stock height WJ, but I'd go with what's recommended by the lift manufacturer.   This is a WK with a 4"" lift, and 285/70R17 tires, roughly 33s"
GrandCherokee,34cl5a,fatty119,1 point,Thu Apr 30 08:17:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestions man. Ill probably end up going with some 33's
GrandCherokee,34cl5a,UnderlyVerbose,2,Fri May 1 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"Being a WJ guy, I can't say for sure, but if they did fit, it would take so much cutting as to get into structural areas of the unibody. You'd also be giving up any use able off road capability.   Can it be done? Yup."
GrandCherokee,347o15,ballison10,3,Tue Apr 28 23:16:59 2015 UTC,Nice. Is that a coating or just a flat/semi paint? I'll feel silly if you tell me it's a Rhino Lining.
GrandCherokee,347o15,200kWJ,2,Tue Apr 28 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"Haha close. It's monstaliner, a DIY bedliner. Really happy with it though. Really similar results with my friend who got his rhino lined"

GrandCherokee,347o15,Slender_Rex,3,Wed Apr 29 02:25:00 2015 UTC,How do you like it? I was hust thinking about doing this to my WJ. How many cans did you go through? Pricey?
GrandCherokee,347o15,Rulother,2,Wed Apr 29 04:06:18 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot. I got 2 gallon tintable (pyroclastic color) kit and it was plenty for me. Considering the price of line-x and rhino liner it was super reasonable. And there was no way I was going herculiner, etc. I highly recommend checking it out. Let me know if you want to know some more! I enjoyed the project, have some progress photos of it if you'd like"

GrandCherokee,345d5e,M107A1,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:08:26 2015 UTC,There small six lights. And underneath there is already a hole there that I just slipped the bolt through and hooked them up to the fog light switch. And the big bar on front is a 20 inch light bar attached to plastic bumper cover with a switch inside the cab. But I'm building my bumper this weekend so it will be a more solid mount. Mine bounces a lot on the plastic.

I wasn't aware the HD was compatible, I thought you needed an adapter and transmission output shaft change. Good to know when my J bites it."
GrandCherokee,33two1,ikidd,2,Sun Apr 26 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"I researched the 242HD, which was a direct swap for my Grand back then, and was even available on a very special few of them from the factory   Are there numbers on how rare it is to have an 242HD? I know the HD was only behind the V8 in '02 and '03 (or was it '01 and '02?) but I'm not entirely sure just how hard to find they are...  I jumped at the opportunity to get my WJ when I found it. I knew that (relatively speaking) there aren't as many V8/242HD combos out there as other options (and it's the drivetrain I wanted)... but I'm just not sure how lucky I got to find a clean one in MA =)"

GrandCherokee,33two1,McWaddle,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:40:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the same drivetrain I've got and I feel the same way about the diffs.  I keep flip flopping on what I want to do...   On one hand I keep thinking I should swap in a pair of vari-lok axles since it would only cost like $400 to do so. On the other hand I also plan on lifting the Jeep soon and keep telling myself I'd be better off spending more to get a more traditional limited slip that doesn't need so much tire spin before it locks up (so when I do take the rig offroad it would perform a bit better)."
GrandCherokee,33two1,themangeraaad,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"A co-worker just got a beautiful WJ. We ran her VIN, and she's got the limited slip diffs. I told her if she ever sees me working on both of our Jeeps out in the parking lot, not to worry about it."
GrandCherokee,33two1,McWaddle,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:51:17 2015 UTC,"Anecdotally,  the variloks seem to hold up well until about a 33 inch tire. If you don't plan on going bigger than that, you're probably fine just going with the stock variloks. I'm still running them."
GrandCherokee,33two1,themangeraaad,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:48:03 2015 UTC,Alright.  Thanks!  After having my last XJ on 35s I have no interest in going that tall again any time soon so 33s would definitely be my limit. If the vari loks hold up to that size they will be enough for me!

Finding all the bolts to remove the dash was quite the chore. I don't believe the Overlands use the same blend doors as the Laredo's but I think it would be worth it to look into  replacing it if its showing signs of wear.They are notorious for going bad. Same goes for the evaporator core. 90% of the work to replace those parts is the removal of the dash. I've heard of a ""short cut""  of cutting into the HVAC sub assembly and sliding the heater core in through the hole and then patching with epoxy. But I wasn't brave enough to try it."

GrandCherokee,332yi1,SirLaxer,2,Sun Apr 19 01:17:39 2015 UTC,Only downside to this body style is that there is VERY little aftermarket support. I think new gears just got released back in 2013 for this style. I'm actually hoping to re-gear it soon to 4.10 to compensate for the bigger tires.

GrandCherokee,32yaq2,never-rong,2,Fri Apr 17 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"Correct.  I did the swap on my early '02. You will need the calipers w/ brackets (I got mine from NAPA), rotors,  and pads. I don't recall anything else particularly noteworthy. All in all an easy swap if you're familiar with brake work.   Off topic moment: replacing the e-brakes though?  Fuck those things."

Check these guys out http://blendorstore.com/ They make a kit and instructions to perform a cutout behind the glovebox instead of tearing the entire dash out.  There is a work around, you mostly notice the blend door issue when it's cold since it can't regulate how much outside air to let in. If you turn the heat to Hi and set the fan on low it (at least for me) shuts out all outside air and you can get nice and warm. If I get too hot crack a window or turn the HVAC system off intimately.  When it is hot just set the temperature to normal and the fan to auto."

If you are also looking for a cai I highly recommend the k&n 57-1545. Sounds great and def helped improve mpgs and give you a little bit more power. What I noticed from the combination of these two is a lot more low end torque. Between 1500 and 3500 rpm in 2nd and 3rd gear will pull decently hard, much more than stock."

Assuming it's all original I'd do the normal tune up - air filter, maybe a fuel filter just due to the age, grease all tie rod ends and such, oil change, flush the brake fluid due to age and maybe trans fluid, etc.  Otherwise I'd just keep an eye out for any worn rubber boots and/or bushings that may have dried and cracked with age, check the tires to make sure they aren't dry rotted at all... not sure what else really.

GrandCherokee,32fw49,BurtDoyle,2,Mon Apr 13 13:49:26 2015 UTC,"Was in getting the visor recall taken care of on my 2012 Grand Cherokee and mentioned that my car stalls while starting every once in a while.  I've brought it in a couple times to have it looked at but I can never replicate at the dealership.  My uncle owns a 2012 Limited as well and he was able to get the dealer to replace the fuel pump and a timing sensor to fix the issue.  This was a year ago, must have been more widespread than they originally let on.  When it's warmer out (I live in the midwest) every once and a while (no pattern at all) when I start the vehicle it will start up, hit 2k RPM and then stall.  If I try and immediately restart it just grinds like there is a starter issue until I turn the vehicle all the way off and cycle through the electricals by pressing the start button 3 or 4x.  Then I attempt to start again and all is good.  If anyone else is having this issue and have been struggling to get the dealer to recognize, a recall is coming to fix the issue."
GrandCherokee,32fw49,Asklepios24,4,Mon Apr 13 13:54:02 2015 UTC,"A recall has been out for a while, p54 was released in december of 2014, it entails relocating the fuel pump relay into an externally mounted serviceable relay.  If your jeep does not fall under the recall there is star case #S1308000399 was released on 5/29/2013 It is the predecessor of recall p54 and will fix the same issues. Do not get suckered into buying another TIPM as the issue will come back in the future."
GrandCherokee,32fw49,Asklepios24,2,Mon Apr 13 16:09:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot, I'll reference if I don't get the recall notice.  Are you suggesting the TIPM will not fix the issue I described?  Or will the Recall I linked not fix it either?"
GrandCherokee,32fw49,guyintransit,4,Mon Apr 13 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"If you replace the TIPM you will be getting the same parts that the recall is supposed to fix, Eventually the TIPM will fail in the same manner as it has already. The only real fix is to install an External relay that can handle the amperage required to run the fuel pump not the solid state transistor that is burning up now."
GrandCherokee,32fw49,Asklepios24,2,Mon Apr 13 17:27:04 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely correct, I don't think; I've read that the initial batch of replacement TIPM's were faulty as well, but they've switched suppliers or something like that. Can read about it on either jeepforum or jeepgarage, can't remember which."
GrandCherokee,32fw49,guyintransit,2,Mon Apr 13 22:36:46 2015 UTC,"Well I'm coming form the last 2 times I replaced TIPMs I was replacing it with the same part number, not a superseded number which is what normally happens when they switch suppliers. I still stand by the external relay is the better repair since it is the most cost effective."
GrandCherokee,32fw49,Asklepios24,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:54:12 2015 UTC,"But how does using an external relay fix all the other TIPM issues? Or is that totally separate thing?

GrandCherokee,328gtp,200kWJ,3,Sun Apr 12 01:34:52 2015 UTC,Just replaced mine this past weekend. It's a fairly simple job but I suggest taking off most of the front end to give yourself more room to work. The only tool that you wouldnt normally use is a torx 30 bit to take out a couple of screws from the front end. I think i finished the job in about 4-5 hours (18 yr old). There is a really good write up on the jeep forum for replacing the radiator on a WJ that I referenced while working on mine.

And that's just to unbolt and pull the radiator up enough to clear everything. A/C should be recovered and the condenser removed, but I've done this several times and can get away without doing that.

GrandCherokee,327097,sensitivetocontext,2,Sat Apr 11 03:07:11 2015 UTC,"Rebuilding the axles have some things to consider.  The easy things in the front are ball joints, hub bearings, U-joints, pinion seal.  These are about 250 in parts.  You can get a lot at Rock Auto, and get ACDelco for the price you would pay locally for chinese crap.  The pinion bearing is a bit of a job, you need an inch-lb dial torque wrench to measure the pre-load in order to torque the pinion nut correctly.  The bearings and crush collar are cheap.  The gears are not a job for the faint-hearted.  You need to be able to adjust the shims by trial and error, and pattern the teeth so you get a centered pattern on the ring gear.  This can take a lot of time and experience to do correctly.  This job is about $300 in parts with the side seals and bearings, or about $7-800 to have done for you.  If you have the trailer tow 3.73s, you probably won't see a pressing need to change the gear ratios.  3.54 might incline you to change.  You can often save some money by getting a D30 high pinion off a later model Cherokee, and you get the advantage of a easier drive angle when you go to lift it.  They are often in 3.73 or even 4.56 if you find one off a 4 cylinder cherokee.  Tire size to gear ratio to RPM chart  Rear axle is inexpensive, just side bearings and seals really.  If you're just doing the seals and outer bearings, you still have to open the diff to pull the C-clips and you have to pull the center pin to get those to fall out.  You could replace the shafts, but I doubt the shafts are the weak point in the system.  I run 33s and I've never stripped splines in the rear, and the Ujoints in the front break before the splines.  In fact, I've cracked off the outer end of a front axleshaft before the splines showed any issue.  Lifts.... wow, big topic.  The taller you go, the less road manners it will have.  If it's going to be a trail queen, long arm 7"" is the way to go.  If you want to be able to drive on the highway and not have to buy new driveshafts and Slip Yoke Eliminator kits, you'll be looking at 3-4.5"", long or short arm.  You'll want adjustable track bars to recenter axles correctly.  Swaybar disconnects, extended brakelines over 3"".  Adjusting the caster angle to reduce driveline vibration is probably needed over 3"", adjustable front upper control arms will allow you to tune the caster to the recommended 4.5-5.5 degrees (you won't get a stock 7.5 with a lift).  This gets you around transfer case drops so you don't lose clearance.  A basic 4.5"" Roughcountry  is $700 or so, but you'll still need some parts and its a shitty riding lift.  A BDS 4.5 is in the 1200 range but comes with a front adj trackbar, and brake lines, disconnects, pinbar eliminators.  Either way, if you can substitute or eliminate the shocks in any ""kit"" and put in Bilstein 5125s, do it.  They make the ride much nicer, even on stiff springs like Roughcountry.  I've seen very good things said about the Old Man Emu springs.  They're a smooth riding spring by all reports.  Bumpers, rock rails are definitely trail considerations.  Let me know if I've missed any questions here.  What transfer case do you have?"
GrandCherokee,327097,ikidd,1 point,Sat Apr 11 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"sorry for the delay, been off for a few days, I'm not sure what kind of transfer case I have, probably stock. I can get it up on a lift tomorrow and get back to you. Thanks for the detailed reply, I'll need to go through it and figure out what some of the stuff you're talking about is. Not familiar with everything. As well, not sure if I mentioned it in my original post but the reason I'm looking at rebuilding/replacing the axles is due to some grinding in the rear diff. I haven't had the chance to open it and get a look inside yet, the fluid looks ok though. I just figured if I'm going to go in there I might as well do it with the intention of lifting and bigger tires. I'll try to get some pictures tomorrow too, maybe a video so you can hear the grinding? Also, random question... is there any benefit to putting calipers on the rear brakes as opposed to drums? drums get full of shit when you're mudding? Anyway, thanks again."
GrandCherokee,327097,ikidd,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:55:02 2015 UTC,"You have calipers on the rear for normal braking, and inside that rotor are drum brakes for emergency brake only.  Grinding is likely the park brake shoes have come apart and the noise sounds like the axle.  But by all means, open the rear diff, it's probably time to change the fluid anyway.  You can check if you have any metal in there."

GrandCherokee,323t71,zombyczar,6,Fri Apr 10 12:36:55 2015 UTC,This right here. Hook a multi meter up in series with your negative battery post and the disconnected negative battery terminal. Make sure you put the leads in the correct spots to read amperage. Pull fuses until the draw drops. Then you can track down the issue now that you know what system it's in. Or take it to a mechanic you trust if you aren't comfortable doing electrical work. Sounds like a pretty cut and dry draw though. Good luck!

Of course if it has a ignition shut off that will need to be corrected. Only some models had factory alarms, but I believe all have remotes for lock/unlock."
GrandCherokee,322g6w,200kWJ,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:55:08 2015 UTC,Well the first thing I would do is find the siren and disconnect it. Then find any wires under the hood or under the dash that do not look original. Use those to find the brainbox and from there identify all the wires and where they go in the car.  From there make sure none of the connections break a wire in a way that removing them would leave something else disconnected.  Remove alarm system.  Shouldn't take too long.
GrandCherokee,322g6w,HeadOfMax,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"Your best bet may to be to bring it to the dealer and pay $100 or so to have a tech look at the wiring and fix it all up for you.

GrandCherokee,320diq,Tomtron2277,2,Thu Apr 9 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"Do you already have a lift to fit the 31's? I assume you're actually talking about wheel spacers to accommodate the extra tire width, and not coil spring spacers. Most wheel spacers are 1.25 - 1.75"" thick. Alternatively, you could get a wider set of wheels with a different offset backspacing. Most coil spacers (if that's really what you mean) add about 2"" to the height.   All of this is available through off road shops. Someone at 4wheelparts.com, or any other, could probably give you some better guidance.   Edit: More info - this thread at Jeeps Unlimited has a couple of charts that are very helpful regarding lifts and tire size for WJ's. The second table looks at wheel offset. I think most people will tell you it's better (safer, less wear & tear) to go with different wheels rather than spacers."

I ended up needing a drag link, all the tie rod ends, steering stabilizer, ball joints, cv axles and wheel bearings. When you lift something its generally a good idea to replace steering parts like that. That said, they should be able to align it if you get just the tie rods taken care of. Around 800 or so sounds reasonable for the tres and ball joints on a wk.  Edit: ive only been refused an alignment due to bad wheel bearings, im not experienced with ifs setups, so I could be wrong, but they should be able to align it with ""bad"" ball joints and tie rods."
GrandCherokee,31ylg7,fatty119,2,Thu Apr 9 06:18:20 2015 UTC,"To add to this, on an IFS system, ball joints are absolutely crucial. They hold the steering knuckle in place.

GrandCherokee,31xexf,enfu3go,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:22:14 2015 UTC,I have used it just not on my ZJ.  Clean the surface you will be using it on with a green scrub pad so the spray adheres evenly.  Be sure to spray in an area that's above 60 and let it sit in said area till it dries or it will dry unevenly and you will get blotches and runs.  Do one coat at a time and let it dry before prepping the surface and applying a second coat if you want it to be darker than it came out.  The more you put down at one time the bigger chance you will have of it coming out blotchy.  http://i172.photobucket.com/albums/w39/HeadOfMax/tailpurple008.jpg  Old car many years ago last time I used it.

That was when I decided I wasn't going to give a shit about the way it looked. Not going down the anal-retentive route that I usually do with my vehicles.  It's been fun. I like the way it looks dirty.
GrandCherokee,31rrdj,roadrash1992,0,Wed Apr 8 05:30:01 2015 UTC,"Eventually you'll accidentally get it covered in mud and in the process of cleaning it scratch the shit out of your otherwise alright paint and it'll look like someone took a grinder to your hood and you'll cry everytime you look at your car as it reminds you of how big of a dumb ass you really are and now I'm crying.  Edit: really though, nice Grand. Hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoy mine!"
GrandCherokee,31toks,Andylope,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:58:21 2015 UTC,"Are you seeing engine temperature being high too? If so, you might have a fan issue. Transmission cooler is integrated with the radiator. You'll see the lines to the trans running I to the bottom unless you have a trailer package and separate cooler strapped in front."
GrandCherokee,31toks,ikidd,2,Wed Apr 8 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"No high engine temperatures either, I'm just stumped on what could be causing this."
GrandCherokee,31toks,ikidd,2,Wed Apr 8 07:00:55 2015 UTC,"Are you able to stress it by trying to haul a trailer and see if you can get a predictable warning?  Because like /u/200kwj says, idle should be easiest on the trans.  Really odd it would overtemp at that point.  A plugged transmission line and overheating would result in weird shifting and poor acceleration."
GrandCherokee,31toks,200kWJ,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:48:51 2015 UTC,After a long period of idling? Most of the time that's when the transmission cools down since it's not under load. I'm thinking a sensor out of whack.
GrandCherokee,31toks,friendnoodle,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"Got a local dealer you trust? Intermittent ""Transmission Over Temp"" messages are a common sight with a solenoid failure. The other common option is a failure of the temperature sensor itself, which is integrated into... either the solenoid pack or the valve body. Can't remember which off hand.  The problem's a lot quicker and cheaper to solve with the proper diagnostic tools and a working knowledge of the 545RFE."

GrandCherokee,31s4te,ChocolateLovin5,2,Tue Apr 7 19:07:36 2015 UTC,"If you don't want it to rub on the factory bumper. You're going to need something like 7+ inches of lift. Even then I'm sure you'll have to trim a it a certain amount.  If you don't mind getting really Sawzall happy, you can fit a 35. However, I think you're stuck with 31s if you don't want to trim."
GrandCherokee,31s4te,GranfatherGlock,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:48:46 2015 UTC,"35s are going to rub like crazy unless you lift it sky-high. 3"" is a good amount of lift for 31s or 32s with trimming. 35s require a whole lot more work, new wheels, and a host of supporting mods if you plan to wheel - stock ZJ axles will not hold up to 35s offroad and you will feel gutless with stock gearing and 35s."

GrandCherokee,31p760,Russell016,4,Tue Apr 7 01:47:01 2015 UTC,"Correction:  College bound student in wheelchair :-) Congratulations  Disclosure: I'm a Chrysler Rep and will receive no financial compensation for your buying or selling a Jeep.   I deal in new cars and will advise new for the following reasons:     1. Warranty.     2. Automobility rebates: we offer incentives to install the equipment that you need. Usually $1000     3. College student rebates - usually $500     4. Tech/safety packages - makes checking blind spots a hell of a lot easier and having nav/voice texting/steering wheel controls is incredible from a safety side     5. Roadside assistance/911 calling.  I spun out on some black ice this year and was able to dial 911 and roadside assistance from the car.  Many used cars only had the service active for a short amount of time.   Grand Cherokees are great, however between the high lift and the distance from the trunk to the front seat might make loading and unloading a pain in the ass.   Cherokees are a bit shorter but with less storage space than the grand cherokee.  Probably not enough of a reduction in hassle to justify stepping to this.    I might recommend checking out the new renegade.  Much shorter from nose to tail and as much room as the compass and patriots.  Might make the walk from trunk to the front a lot easier.  They're only just hitting the ground, but the tranny is the same as the 200 and Cherokee and with the AWD tests at MOAB last year, its supposed to be very capable.    This would be a great vehicle in your price range with all of the added safety features (sub $30k for a loaded trailhawk, top line functionality, after rebates) and would qualify for all of those rebates I mentioned."
GrandCherokee,31p760,True_Go_Blue,2,Tue Apr 7 02:31:57 2015 UTC,"Ha, that was a pretty funny typo on my part. Thanks for the info, I didn't know about the rebates, that sounds awesome. I won't be loading the wheelchair in the back, I'll just be tossing it in the passenger, so a long distance to the trunk isn't that big of a deal. EDIT: I do need to ask, how much room is in between the seats and the steering wheel/dash? Since I'll be pulling my wheelchair in that way, I would prefer a good bit of room. It is perfectly fine if I have to adjust the seat all the way back. I was actually starting to lean towards the Cherokee instead of the Grand, mostly for the price difference. (Am I correct in their price ranges of ~22K-30K vs the Grand's 30K and up?) Lastly, is there a major size difference between the two?   Also, I see all the different models, both for the Cherokee and the Grand Cherokee. Mind telling me what the major differences are and if they really matter? As far as I can tell it just seems like bells and whistles to me.    And I'll certainly look into the Renegade."
GrandCherokee,31p760,True_Go_Blue,2,Tue Apr 7 05:26:31 2015 UTC,"Price Ranges:  Renegade - $20-$30K.

You can get the Cherokee in a 2.4L 4 cylinder engine or a 3.6L Pentastart V-6.  The V-6 is more powerful and costs more.  Technology Features: Bluetooth, Satellite radio, Lane Departure warnings, Forward Collision, Cross Path-Detection, in console USB/media controls, etc.  Creature comforts:  Sunroof, Premium leather vs standard leather, heated/ventilated seats, Upgraded speakers, etc.    If you're not in a time crunch, then you can take your time and order the one you want built from the factory.

GrandCherokee,31lmci,BravoTeam127,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"You might be better off changing to a wrangler. If you want an off road only machine, a wrangler will never let you down. You should be able to get a good one through a trade. WJ's are awesome, but they are also huge, bulky, heavy, and uni-frame. A lot of die hard fans on here will say go for a WJ, but an honest logical opinion would be to switch.   If you are a die hard fan and want your WJ, then I would recommend 33"" tires to go with the 4"" lift. If you get a 4"" lift, you need to get a long arm kit. WJ's don't do well without them after 3""s (and maybe even under 3). They have a tendency to develop DW. I currently have a 2"" lift with 30.6"" tires and I have gone everywhere my Jeep Cherokee with a 3"" lift and 31s could go.  33s will just about get you anywhere, and it shouldn't wear as hard on the differentials. I know on the old Cherokees you had to regear around 33, but I'm not sure on the WJ's.  As far as a bumper, buy a solid one. If you really think you need a new bumper, then don't go cheap, or you'll pay for it in the long run."

Personally putting the spare on the roof isn't an option since I don't want the increased COG that comes with putting the spare up there, plus that would eliminate my ability to use my kayak carrier up there.  From what I've found supposedly up to a 30.8""x9.50 will fit in the spare tire well (supposedly without lifting the lid at all) but I'm not sure about that considering the 245/65R17 WK take-offs I'm running now lifts the lid a touch.  Right now I'm torn between a few options: A) Keep my OEM size spare for street driving and toss a full size spare in the back when wheeling. B) Limit myself to a 245/70R17 (or 245/75R16 if I go back to 16"" wheels) tire C) Step up to a 265/65R17 or 265/70R16 and build a frame to raise the whole spare tire lid so it sits flush (plus this would give me a bit of storage room under the lid for small gear). D) Build a spare tire carrier to throw the spare on the back and step up to a true 31+"" tire.  If I go with option D I think I'd have to build something like this or this. I like the clean almost OEM look of those options."

If it hasn't, this is an even better position to be in, then you know the fuel pump and starter haven't been exposed to serious strain from failure of the TIPM fuel relay failure. Water pump/coolant pump, these things fail like hot cakes in the Hemi.  Check for leaks.  Bag the crap out of it on a test drive and check for the smoke show. Air suspension, raise up the vehicle all the way, check ride quality... you may hear a loud thump when going over bumps.   Then lower it all the way and make sharp turns, listen for squealing or creaking from the front end. Rear hatch push button lock - there's a chrome button on the rear hatch, much like the door handles.  These notoriously don't work.  Push this button to make sure you can lock the vehicle with this button. Raise and retract the power hatch, make sure it closes all the way. Finally check for uneven wear on the tires.  My vehicle goes out of alignment a lot, so you get cupping on the outer aspect of the tires. Do a long test drive if it has the ACC/FCW system.  Mine is dodgy and sometimes a light comes on saying it's not functional. Check to see what maintenance has been done.  These things take 16 spark plugs, so even a spark change is $$.  Differential fluid changes and a decarb are coming up for this vehicle. -Finally... the piece of shit head unit sucks.  I can't use my iPhone with it at all.  It's slow, won't play through the usb cable, has constant iPhone connection issues. Check the fuel door button... mine sticks Otherwise, I've heard of cylinder head issues with the V6."

GrandCherokee,30rtc0,UnderlyVerbose,2,Mon Mar 30 18:29:04 2015 UTC,"Although I haven't done it myself, I've read up on the subject on the Jeep Forums some time ago and I recall someone saying you can't just swap out the bulbs without swapping out the housing. Halogens and LEDs disperse light differently and thus require different housings built specifically for that type of bulb to emit the light properly. Otherwise your shit's either too strong or too weak or just all over the place, which is why I've held off on swapping out. I don't want to be that dick that has my lights setup all wrong and am blinding people in the oncoming lanes.   My brother bought me LED fog lights for my birthday that I will install when it warms up a bit more and I can fix up the rusted spots where I plan to place the lights, but again, they are already manufactured with the proper housing.  PIAA LP530 if anyone is interested in buying them, they're pretty pricey though.   Also if anyone reads up on it further and it turns out I'm wrong, I just want to reiterate that it's what I read off the Internet. I don't proclaim to be an expert on this or even right, so don't come at me with pitchforks. If someone with better knowledge and experience has any info, I'd love to know about it too because I've also been wanting to swap for LEDs for quite some time :)"

I was on the west side of the mountain but due to some wind and light blowing snow decided to go over the crest onto the east side to get out to of the wind- as I descended down over a packed snow bank I spotted the perfect place to set up. Managed to only stay out for about 45 minutes before my fingers were so cold I could not reload any longer. I turned the WJ around, and started to climb the hard snow packed bank I had easily rolled over on the way in. I immediately sunk, and all the snow turned to ice as soon as it touched anything hot.   Hours and hours of digging (not just to free myself, but I also still had to go about 20' forward) to no avail. Comealong was not long enough. I did not have a strap for the job.... so many bad choices on my part (though I did bring a big shovel just in case). Had to hike a few miles out to the nearest 'village' and find someone willing to drive up in the now blizzard to help me out. I honestly thought I'd be leaving my new-to-me GC in the mountains for the winter at that point.   A guy with a brand new Chevy HD2500 came to the rescue almost getting himself stuck in the process, and I repurposed a $350 climbing rope I had in the Jeep to become a tow strap.   I bought a 35' tow strap the next day, and about 3 weeks later had a 9500# winch sitting on the front of the dub!"

I hadn't really intended to go offroad with that thing (of course) and so I had nothing with me.  Had to hike down the mountain to somebody's squatter shack near the base, and they called a guy nearby that had a truck.  He also had some whiskey, which was nice.  I went back to town and dropped off a 40 for him the next day.  Didn't get a winch for that truck, but sure don't offroad in a full-length pickup anymore..."

I've seen it for a little over $100 if you look around.  http://www.4wheelparts.com/Air-Compressors-Air-Tanks-Air-Accessories/5-65-CFM-Air-Compressor.aspx?t_c=89&t_s=566&t_pt=100437&t_pn=S%2FB2781  On the air topic, these deflators are really great.  You set them all to the pressure you want your tires brought down to, then put them on all the tires, and have a coffee until they're done.  No farting around with a gauge and doing them one at a time."
GrandCherokee,30hhdz,ikidd,2,Fri Mar 27 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"I forgot deflators.  I use this one, it pulls the stem and your tire is deflated in about 10 seconds.  It took me about 1-2 uses to get good with it, I can now air down in less time then it takes most people to screw on the auto deflators.    http://www.amazon.com/ARB-ARB505-E-Z-Deflator/dp/B004LQCDOA"

GrandCherokee,303k99,CaptObvius,5,Tue Mar 24 05:48:42 2015 UTC,"TBH, if you're broke, lifting it is the last thing you want to do. You'll shell out $500 for a basic lift kit, closer to $1k if you want to do it right. Another $1k for wheels and tires, on top of the hundreds you'll spend fixing the aging steering and suspension. Not to mention the decrease in fuel mileage too. Can you do it cheaper? Sure, a lot of price shopping and keeping an eye out for used parts on Craigslist, and forums. If you have a weekend, basic tools and a buddy, you can do it yourself. There are plenty of resources or there on it.   But if it isn't your daily, or you don't mind ramen too much. I've seen great results from Iron Rock Offroad's 3.5"" kit first hand."

GrandCherokee,303k99,GranfatherGlock,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:18:51 2015 UTC,Best riding lift springs are the Rubicon express springs.
GrandCherokee,303k99,archduke_troll,2,Wed Mar 25 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"If you want a little bit of lift that's noticeable and really improves your offroad capability, go with a budget boost. A budget boost is essentially a hockey puck that sits above your springs. The max you can lift with a budget boost is 2.5"" (they sell 3"" boosts but they are unsafe), but it will allow you to put on 31"" tires and it looks good! Tires any bigger than 31s are a lot heavier than stock and will really rob you of MPG so if you're a poor college student this is the ""responsible"" thing to do.  Ooooorrrr, buy one of the Iron Rock Offroad Kits and go big and hard. Expect to shell out at least $1k for any decent lift above 3"", you have to replace a lot of suspension parts to do it right."
GrandCherokee,303k99,opedwriter,2,Tue Mar 24 05:58:40 2015 UTC,"For an easy and inexpensive 3"" lift, you can look into the front to rear spring swap."
GrandCherokee,303k99,dfowen6,2,Tue Mar 24 06:23:55 2015 UTC,"Lifting a new Jeep should not be one of the first things you do to it if you're on a budget. All the old, worn out steering and suspension parts will makes themselves know. Not to mention if you don't buy a quality, complete lift kit to begin with you'll end up replacing the cheap parts and buying quality parts in order to make your Jeep drive well again.  At a minimum for 3"" you will need  3"" Lift Coils Front and Rear. You can do a front to rear swap, it just won't ride all that well since it's a 17 year old spring with the wrong spring rate.   Longer Shocks. Your stock shocks aren't long enough and will not only impede suspension travel but also wear out extremely quick.  Adjustable Track Bars Front and Rear. The track bars are what keeps your axles centered under your Jeep.  Don't use any track bar relocation brackets, it's well know that they will shear off under stress and take the factory frame bracket with them leading to lots of time with welder to fix it.   Not to mention once you lift it you'll probably discover you need new balljoints, tie rod ends, and a variety of other steering parts in order to fix the death wobble that will occur if anything is severely worn out.   If I were you I'd get all caught up repairs and maintenance before I lifted my ZJ. Change all your fluids, do a tune up, etc... Check all your steering and suspension parts for wear. That means control arm bushings, ball joints, tie rod ends and drag link. You can ignore your track bars if you're planning on replacing them with adjustable ones. You should also check your hub assemblies for wear. Then after you've fixed everything it needs, you should be able to lift it with no worries."
GrandCherokee,303k99,archduke_troll,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"Anything you do, do it yourself, because your lift kit installer isn't going to be on the trail with you to fix things.  It's not rocket science if you follow the instructions closely and are relatively meticulous.  Lift kit is pretty much a good set of metric sockets and wrenches, jack and jackstands, and a torque wrench to do everything back to torque spec.  But like everyone else here, make sure everything is fixed beforehand because a $500 lift is going to expose $1000 worth of fix-me, many things that you aren't going to want to do yourself if you aren't experienced and have a lot of tools.  Ball joints and pinion bearings come to mind."

And because it is a small tank, the impact of midrange fuel on my wallet does not hurt much... its like a buck and a half extra...  It just kills me to fill up so often.

GrandCherokee,2zrzlw,ikidd,1 point,Sat Mar 21 05:56:07 2015 UTC,thanks! I guess my question was if you guys thinks this is just a minor fix or something much bigger like some wiring/electronic problems that would cost diagnosing and replacing interior wiring
GrandCherokee,2zrzlw,ikidd,1 point,Sat Mar 21 06:04:08 2015 UTC,"Minor.  Worst case is the hatch harness might need some splices if the other taillights work fine.  Of course, getting a mechanic to do anything is rarely cheap, being able to fix things like this yourself is a definite money saver."

Swapped the CPS then tested the old one afterwards, and if I shook it, the meter would drop out of range.  It would also bounce RPMs at idle, hence why I thought IAC.  Kind of a pain in the ass to change but I would bet $$ on this being the cause."

GrandCherokee,2zr39w,ikidd,1 point,Sat Mar 21 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's the transmission oil pump.  If you can have someone put it in drive and try revving a bit while on the brakes, maybe listen to the front of the transmission.  Also, check your transmission fluid level, in neutral, hot.  This might vary by vehicle, some of them want you to check it in park.  Shoudl say on your dipstick or in the manual.  If it only does it when moving, I'd be inclined to figure something axle, driveshaft, or transfer case related."

GrandCherokee,2zqfbz,ikidd,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"Probably a repaint from an accident, and they put the clearcoat on too dry paint without sanding.  You can try sanding them down carefully with 1000 grit (don't go through the paint) and then give it a bit of clearcoat spray bomb from an autobody supply store.  YMMV with the amount of practice you give it.  Then a quick sand and buff to flatten the CC out.  But it will probably start coming up somewhere else.  Otherwise it's a sand and repaint since you have to get all the shitty CC off.  Probably not too bad if you take the hood off and do the sanding, someone might repaint it fairly cheap that way.  I had this happening on my CJ, it was at the front edge so I ended up using color-matched rocker guard for the first 12"" of the hood.  It actually looks really spanky and no worry about rock chips anymore."

GrandCherokee,2zm8y1,themangeraaad,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:50:39 2015 UTC,"If you have any death wobble (esp with little to no lift) your next ""upgrade""  should absolutely be finding and fixing the problem.   Even without death wobble I'd probably say inspecting and replacing ball joints,  control arm bushings,  tie rod ends,  wheel bearings, shocks, etc should be on the top of the list.   But otherwise I'd also recommend the sway bar. Also get energy suspension bushings for it since they are cheap on amazon and are a nice (greasable)  upgrade compared to the non greaseable bushings that come with the addco swaybar"

In that case I'd definitely recommend anything that's getting old and worn and adding the addco sway bar.   I replaced my shocks and added just the rear addco swaybar (for some reason the front is far more expensive than the rear otherwise I'd have got both) and it made a night and day difference. The Jeep no longer feels like a boat and has tons of body roll through corners - it feels much more planted and confident around corners now.  Granted the ride is a bit stiffer now which some people might not like but honestly? This is how the Jeep should have come. I'll be getting the front swaybar too sooner than later I expect."

GrandCherokee,2z703w,tna_D,3,Mon Mar 16 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"ESP is Electronic Stability Program and BAS is Brake Assist System.   ESP is a system that improves your vehicle's stability by sensing loss of traction, and the BAS is a system that is used to optimize pressure applied to the brakes in emergency situations.    You've probably got an issue with a  sensor, but there are usually around 4-6 sensors associated with the ESP/BAS system (steering wheel angle sensor, yaw rate sensor, lateral acceleration sensor, wheel speed sensor, roll rate sensor and longitudinal acceleration sensor) so it would probably be your best bet to go get it checked out since when the lights are on the systems are not working.   Edit: Your ABS light and Traction Control Light will always come on with the ESP/BAS light since it's all part of the same system.  But not vice versa."

GrandCherokee,2z5js2,diggz00,3,Sun Mar 15 19:50:49 2015 UTC,Normally you can shift from N to D and D to N without pressing the brake. I have noticed that with our trans you have to break. You don't need to be stopped but just on the break enough to let you switch.

GrandCherokee,2z5js2,mrniceguy421,2,Sun Mar 15 20:04:46 2015 UTC,"With the electronic transmission you simply have to apply a little break in order to shift back to D when you are going a slow speed.

GrandCherokee,2z5js2,fweepa,2,Mon Mar 16 16:23:48 2015 UTC,I'm fairly certain you've got to be going at least some minimum speed before it'll let you shift N > D wile moving. I've noticed this same thing though and you can definitely shift R > through N > D while moving so I'm not sure.

GrandCherokee,2z4ev1,Meta4X,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:32:16 2015 UTC,"I came here to offer the same suggestion.  The Addco rear swaybar with Energy Suspension bushings is the single biggest (and possibly easiest) upgrade you can get for the money.  If your swaybar end-links are worn out, replace those at the same time.  Pick up a decent grease gun for the bushings if you don't already have one.  Even on my rustbucket 2004 Overland (spent the last 10 years on Michigan's salty roads), I was able to swap out the sway bar using hand tools and an impact wrench in about 30 minutes.  If your suspension is getting worn out, consider replacing the shocks and springs too, along with the steering dampener.  I paid a shop to replace my springs and did the rest of the work myself.  Against, very easy work, and my WJ is driving like a whole new car."

GrandCherokee,2z5uug,latitudesixtysix,2,Sun Mar 15 23:11:33 2015 UTC,Rear axle seals are a fairly common problem on Wj jeeps. I had to replace them on my '04 limited when I bought it. I also had a problem with the fan control module (dual climate control) where the module had heated to the point of melting and fused the wire harness together. People have always told me that you should look out for cooling system problems on 4.0L jeeps but honestly i've never had any myself.

GrandCherokee,2z5uug,RedSocks157,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:20:43 2015 UTC,I've never owned a 4.0L that didn't leak oil from the valve cover gasket. It's usually harmless and can be replaced fairly easily if your somewhat handy. 4k sounds good if it's really clean and runs good. I paid 2400 for mine but it was in rougher shape and high mileage (250k)

GrandCherokee,2yydd1,DeChache,2,Sat Mar 14 00:05:50 2015 UTC,I always wondered if an electric one has been hacked in by others to save a buck.
GrandCherokee,2yydd1,WarMace,2,Sat Mar 14 00:15:31 2015 UTC,"It does the job in cold weather, but I hear that it isn't enough sometimes especially under load in a lot of heat. I overheat climbing long passes (8-10k ft up) in the summertime when it gets warm, have to slow down, turn off a/c etc and keep my eye on the temp.  I can't imagine driving it under load in much more than 90f (32c)"
GrandCherokee,2yydd1,TheSurtees,2,Sat Mar 14 04:15:45 2015 UTC,This gets me thinking.   Wonder if it would be beneficial to mount a pusher fan on the front of the radiator and wire it to a switch. That way you can use it as needed.
GrandCherokee,2yydd1,dfowen6,2,Sat Mar 14 07:07:39 2015 UTC,"Im not an expert, I only know what I do from fixing my Jeeps on my own. I have observed a lot of things though.  When it is hot outside, and the engine has warmed up (and is still running), the fan never turns off as far as I can tell. Apparently it is programmed to have two speeds, but I don't know the details about it. I can tell you that if someone is smoking a cigarette 5 feet in front of my Jeep at a warm idle, the fan will take the smoke directly towards the radiator.  I think the way mine is done is pretty well stock all things considered.  If I were having serious issues I would look into it further. I could still open the louvers up a little bit and get more airflow, but thats bad where anything falls out of the sky, and I drive in the dust, mud, rain, sleet, snow, and floods like most passionate Jeep drivers. So, I have not done that and don't plan on it.  I had a 5.2 and it got a little warm on occasion too. If I lived in a really hot place I might consider getting a switch with an electronic fan for slow wheeling in the desert or something, though I've only ever done that (and had it be a concern, once in moab) with a HO 4.0.  What I don't know with something like that would be that at some point, if you were to be driving faster than the fan spins, you might be better off the hydraulic fan way. I think the only reason mine is electric is because they didn't have the room for a hydraulic one, but if someone has more knowledge than I do, please correct me.  Edit- It looks like this guy did it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVx8YaVXUM4"
GrandCherokee,2yydd1,TheSurtees,1 point,Tue Mar 17 23:42:22 2015 UTC,"I've heard legend of a few who have done it.  One story goes that the flow sensor (what sets off the CEL when you take out the fan) can be simply removed from the hydro fan and zip tied out of the way, making room for an electric one.  This would be amazing if it works, because it becomes a super cheap fix, allowing you to run any sort of electric fan.  I've always meant to look into it more, but now I don't have as much motivation.  The plan I was cooking up was to find an electric pump to run the fan on a completely different (fluid) circuit, creating two separate systems, thus eliminating the dependence on the steering circuit.  I think this plan has potential, because you still have the performance of a hydro fan, but not the fragility of one who depends on the steering system.    It did get...complex, however...  I was gonna rig it up on mine to test for a buddy who is planning on getting his WJ into 4600 class racing ""sometime soon"".  I'd like to pick it back up sometime.  Either way, getting the cooling system and steering systems separated again is the bane of all us 4.7WJ folks' existence."

So basically the snap ring came loose and probably was blocking the park pawl.  Drop the tcase and OD unit and take in to get it pressed.  So, OP, this isn't too bad of a job, but it's pretty messy.  And you'll likely be down for quite a while.  You have to drop the valve body to see if this is the problem, which takes about an hour, and you'll want to replace the pan gasket and filter when you do that.  And that's assuming you can actually see up into the hole that goes back to the OD unit.  Might be best to find a trusted transmission shop, get some referalls from local jeep club perhaps.

Worst case, your wheels are all true and balanced, and you've done something like messed up the alignment (not a big problem) or bent something like a control arm, or the actual wheel itself, or maybe a brake rim."

It should be checked hot and in neutral.  Also, are you certain they used ATF-4 and not some Mercon/Dexron fluid?  You can lose reverse by not having the fluid level correct.  Also note, you do not want it overfilled either, that is just as bad.  And your 4WD being out will be a transfer case issue.  That should have been looked at and taken apart while the tcase was down for the seal replacement.  I'm assuming this was the transmission to transfer case seal?"

I after 8 months I got the donor jeep and pulled the trans, once I have the money for a shift box(my jeep doesn't have a TCU like the XJ, so have to get fancy) I will be swapping in the trans and new tcase to get that sweet RWD option.   Until you can get in to get that checked, just be careful about parking, always look for slopes, small medians you can drive over, and pull through parking spots. It is worth the money to have a shop take a look as if you have the 42re, A simple repair is expensive and time consuming."

Had it serviced on friday, everything was good, had some new plugs and a new boot connector put in. Drove fine, no issues.  Didnt go anywhere over the weekend, monday morning the check engine light comes on, i pull over and see this little puddle. Seems like just water, my coolant levels are good, all the other fluids are fine.   I think the leak and light are unrelated but...hey, i'm no expert.  Edit: discovered the source of the leak: wiper fluid.    Edit 2:  Mechanic told me it was a bad spark plug put in during friday's tuneup. Don't know if that's true but he's never steered me wrong, the light is off, drove it about with no problems and I'm about as handy as a double amputee so I'll take his word for now. He didn't charge me so maybe he just did the key trick and that's all but in any event everything seems right now.   Thanks, everyone."
GrandCherokee,2yfz1v,speedkillz,2,Mon Mar 9 14:23:32 2015 UTC,"Could use a little more info, but from what you've said, that color reminds me of either power steering fluid, or front differential fluid. Since you said all other fluids are fine I'm assuming you checked clutch master cylinder (highly unlikely it's manual but I like to cover all my bases), power steering fluid reservoir, brake master cylinder, front diff for leakage, (if it's 4x4), transmission tail end, transfer case (if 4x4) and rear diff. It would be odd for coolant to be that color, so I doubt that's what it is. It's either motor oil or power steering fluid. Or diff fluid. You said you had it serviced but didn't mention if that included an oil change. If they didn't secure the oil filter properly that would cause a leak and a check engine light for low oil pressure. On the chance that the two aren't related, CEL's can be triggered by loose gas caps. When did you last fill up?"
GrandCherokee,2yfz1v,Cadd,2,Mon Mar 9 15:11:53 2015 UTC,That's a great list.    And you were right about the stick; ZJs were the only Grand Cherokees to be offered with a manual

GrandCherokee,2yct37,speedisavirus,3,Mon Mar 9 10:10:23 2015 UTC,Why is there any reason to think that will happen. Its seems most probable that it would be based on a larger version of what the GC rides on which is actually quite nice and pretty capable.

GrandCherokee,2yeo9x,SaucyRebel,2,Wed Mar 18 02:39:13 2015 UTC,"Why do you want 15"" rims? 16"" should fit without issue and isnt that much of a price and look difference.  Anyways, for 15"" rims it depends on the backspacing on the rims, I can't give you a number but google '15"" rims on wj'. Either way its going to be a tight fit and you might have to grind your calipers a bit.  Nothing beats actually trial fitting the rims on the vehicle. Good luck."
GrandCherokee,2yeo9x,dfowen6,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:32:50 2015 UTC,"I wanna do 15s because I want to put on General Grabbers, the red letter ones. If I put on a 2.5"" lift, the max tire size with no trimming would be like a 31x10.50, and the smallest Grabber for a 16"" rim is an overall diameter of 31.6"" which would require some trimming. I'm not terribly confident in trimming though. If I'd have to grind my caliper, I'd feel even less confident. So I may just end up staying with 16s."

GrandCherokee,2ybun9,DankestM114,2,Tue Mar 10 13:53:07 2015 UTC,I work at a Chrysler Dealer. The main difference between the limited and the laredo is just the trim level. The limited can have Leather/Moonroof/Heated Seats/20Inch Wheels/ 8inch Touch Screen/Nav and a few other minor options. You can also get a Laredo-E which is a standard laredo plus the 8 inch screen/ heated seats and a moonroof. Personally if you are considering a Limited I would look at the Altitude package. They come with the Overland exterior trim/ leather/ 8inch/ heated seats etc and overall stand out over a limited and look nicer. You can get the V8/V6 in any trim as well as the quadratrac system. You are more likely to find the quadratrac in a limited though. Hope this helps!

GrandCherokee,2y8z8w,fatty119,2,Sat Mar 7 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It was about an hour to take all the trim and clips off and pull out the headliner.  It took about three hours to glue down the fabric, flip it over and cut all the holes and pull and glue the fabric to the underside.  I went very slow and heavily applied adhesive.  Also, most tutorials just cut the holes and don't pull through and glue to the other side, I was being anal. Then about an hour and a half to put it together.  It would go quicker with another person and I forgot that my rear door handles/lights had pieces that had to be installed before putting the headliner in, so shoving those in and installing them took longer than expected/it could have been.  Do it!!! So worth it."

Now this is going to be strange from a guy that has some excessive pinstriping down the length of each side of his ZJ, but I still wash with the two bucket method.  One bucket to rinse out the wash glove, one bucket with the soapy water.  Change the rinse water frequently so you don't scratch up the paint worse than the trees did.  Some places/sites sell an insert for a 5G bucket that lets the dirt settle below a grate, so you don't swish it up as you rinse or soap up, and get it back on the glove.  I also follow a lot of what /r/AutoDetailing has to say, there are a lot of pros on there that can give tips if you can't find your answers here."

GrandCherokee,2y5srg,ReagansAngryTesticle,0,Fri Mar 6 22:24:46 2015 UTC,Use that 1% as the starting point for your price negotiations.     Don't let them fool you into calling that an unbelievable deal. Pit multiple dealerships against each other. Make them bid against each other and get it from the one who gives you the best price.   Oh and don't settle for one they have in stock. Make sure they find one with all the options you want if it's not in stock. They can also order it but they can do a dealer trade to get you what you want faster.

Also, Gibson cat back exhaust."
GrandCherokee,2xrfh2,tna_D,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:46:13 2015 UTC,Okay can you explain the purpose of the cat back exhaust?
GrandCherokee,2xrfh2,Krozet,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"You're supposed to get better fuel economy and more power, but we put mine on not long after we bought it, so I don't even remember what my mpg was before that.    It also is relatively quiet inside the Jeep.  All of the vehicles I've been in (I appraise/buy cars for a living, so I've been in quite a few) with just an aftermarket muffler sound terribly loud inside compared to the vehicles with full/cat back exhaust systems.  Of course, the sound you want to get out of it is a personal preference."
GrandCherokee,2xlete,roadrash1992,2,Sun Mar 1 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"If you have a new battery that's testing as ""good,"" and your grounds are all clean, that leaves your positive circuit.  I have zero experience in Jeep electrical problems, so I don't know any common culprits, but I would pop open your engine bay fuse box, pull some fuses, and check the connections against ground to ensure that they're at least getting power.    Next, if your fuse box is getting power, try looking at the fuses and relays.    This is all standard procedure for electrical problems (check grounds and fuses) but based on what you're describing (no electricity in the cabin with the key ""on""), it sounds like an ignition switch to me.  Do your domelights still work or are they dead, too?  Note:  Don't drop, hit, or concuss your battery in any way.  You're going to break/dislodge the lead plates and ruin your new battery (if you haven't already done so)."
GrandCherokee,2xlete,redshift88,2,Sun Mar 1 22:57:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely nothing has power, headlights, domelights, nothing, I have to wait until my girlfriend gets off to go buy a multimeter and I'll test everything.   I did not know that about batteries, however nothing I did was any harsher than taking a speed bump too fast. Thanks for that info, though! Good to know."
GrandCherokee,2xlete,redshift88,2,Sun Mar 1 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't worry about the battery thing too much.  I'm sure it's fine.    If you're not getting dome lights, which should work regardless of the ignition switch, then what ever is causing this is most likely in your engine bay junction/fuse box.  Again,  I don't know Jeep electrical systems, but a total loss of interior power sounds like a relay not switching on or a fuse in you main junction box.    check out the ""power distribution center"" diagram about halfway down the page at this link.  [(http://www.justanswer.com/jeep/2s3d1-1996-jeep-grand-cherokee-v8-down-around-junction-block.html)]  Ignore the interior box for now.    If absolutely nothing is turning on, I'd suspect the battery connection on the bottom right, or any of the fuses connected to the battery.  Good luck.  If you get a multimeter, pay the extra couple bucks to make sure it has a ""continuity"" test feature.  Basically, it should require a battery and will beep if you touch the two leads together.  This is handy for making sure there's no break in a wire between point A & B.  You can use this to see if your battery is actually grounded by touching on lead to the negative terminal and the other to your chassis.  Alternatively, you can do something similar to check that your positive terminal is actually connected to your electrical boxes.  Sorry you're having a bad Sunday."
GrandCherokee,2xlete,Enochx,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"Tracking down wiring issues are a complete pain in the ass, but if you take a step by step method you will save yourself tons of time.  If it there is no power at all, then start over at basics.   Battery Checked and Charged Terminals Clean and tight -(seriously sandpaper or clean wire brush the battery posts / inside the cable end) Power tested on battery cables right off the terminal ends Power tested on Starter connectors. (+ and - starter cable ends tight and tested) and so on...   Trace the power path and test it at each step and you will eventually find the problem. My best guess is that a bad battery cable / or connection at a terminal ( battery - starter - ground )  is the issue."
GrandCherokee,2xl299,n0oo7,1 point,Sun Mar 1 18:58:00 2015 UTC,"Looks very straightforward.  Route lines, drill a hole to push lines through at the back, remove radio and put that connector inline.  Doesn't look like you have to locate and splice into any lines.  If you aren't comfortable doing it, pick it up and take to a shop and get a quote.  I'd say an hour of labour.  Make sure your radio matches the compatible ones in the manual I linked above."

I'm speaking only on recommendations, as I have my stock shocks. A lot of people also like Monroe.

Lol  They seem to be good these days. But I've got General Grabber AT2s on my WJ right now. I love em so far, had em on since the summer and I love em. I have the 225/75R16 size, which is XL load. They have some slight noise on the highway at 80mph and higher, but they're fairly quiet usually. The 245/70R16 is not XL rated, they're standard load. The overall diameter difference is half an inch, so it's negligible. The 225 is smaller, but better load rating. The Grabber HTS is the same way, but they are Low Rolling Resistance, so a bit better mileage especially if its a tow rig.  I'm just helping a fellow Jeeper to the  best of my abilities.

GrandCherokee,2xhgt6,mantich92,2,Sat Feb 28 19:06:13 2015 UTC,"I have the 4"" short kit.  It's... rough.  A lot rougher than stock.  It was better with the Bilstein shocks I swapped in vs. the shitty RC shocks they send you.  The hardware was cheap and I replaced it with grade 8 stuff.  I run at about 20PSI in the tires to make it manageable, so it fucks up my gas mileage a bit.  If I were doing it again, I'd probably buy the IRO or OME springs, and get my shocks separately (the ZJ rear Bilsteins 5125 are on perpetual backorder for the last year). Front and rear adjustable trackbars to skip the relocation brackets and set my own centerlines.  Adjustable upper front control arms (to set pinion angle and caster because the eccentric doesn't go far enough at 4"") and fixed for lower and rear sets (rear upper adjustable if you have some extra $$).  F&R bump stop extensions. This effectively covers what a shortarm kit covers, but much better for adjustment, and 10x quality.  If you just wanted a kit, I would probably go with the BDS 4.5"".  It includes all of the above except  a rear trackbar.  And I'm pretty sure the shocks are the Bilstein monotube.  It also comes with brakelines, crossmember drop spacers and swaybar disconnects.  Extra but pretty much necessary: IRO front extended brakelines.    Rubi Express quick disconnects are the best I've seen, with grease nipples on the heim joint.  If you don't disconnect, you probably won't need the longer brakelines, but when you have the kit on, you can flex it out and see.  New front and back spring pads because it's probably time and IRO has them cheap.  Heavier stabilizer shock if you're going with >31"" tires.  I'm really down on pretty much every kit for the shocks they include.  Unless they have a brand name shock in the kit, it will likely be a cheapout shock.  And all of them will tell you it's the best.  It's not.  Of the 4 RC shocks I got, 2 of them were leaking in 6 months.  I've heard the same on the other makers."
GrandCherokee,2xhgt6,ikidd,1 point,Sat Feb 28 20:09:24 2015 UTC,Does some of this apply to the long arm kit? And how much is the bds kit
GrandCherokee,2xhgt6,ikidd,1 point,Sun Mar 1 01:56:16 2015 UTC,"The long arm kit just replaces the control arms with a longer set and brackets/center crossmember replacement. Since there's an upgrade kit for the long arms only, I suspect they use the same springs in the LA kit as the regular 4"" kit.  The BDS kit is $1699 I think, but includes a lot of stuff that the regular RC kit doesn't, and would probably come out close to the same price to add.  The RC LA 4"" kit looks pretty complete, but with the shitty RC shocks, and the hard springs I'm not a fan of.  You would definitely want a set of extended brake lines with this kit, I'm mystified why they aren't included, given that the LA setup should give superior articulation.  Keep in mind, if you have a CV front drive shaft, you'll be best to change to a U-joint version with any 4"" lift, even if you get adjustable uppers and turn the pinion up a bit.  CVs are not very strong, and don't take deeper angles well.  I have a grenaded one in my garage as an example from a steep hill climb."

GrandCherokee,2x4h91,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, these plus/minus are a semi-automatic transmission so they are similar to the notches in older cars where it sets the maximum gear that the transmission will go to. i.e. when set to 1 you have access to only 1st gear, 2 you have access to 1st and 2nd, etc.  This can also be done while driving to help with quicker downshifts as I know my WK sometimes has a longer delay than I'd like when trying to accelerate to make a pass on the highway."
GrandCherokee,2x4h91,DankestM114,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"Semi-automatic transmission:       A semi-automatic transmission (SAT) (also known as a clutchless manual transmission, automated manual transmission, flappy-paddle gearbox, or paddle-shift gearbox) is an automobile transmission that does not change gears automatically, but rather facilitates manual gear changes by dispensing with the need to press a clutch pedal at the same time as changing gears. It uses electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators to execute gear shifts on input from the driver or by a computer. This removes the need for a clutch pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronise the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by automobile manufacturers to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some motorcycles also use a system with a conventional gearchange but without the need for manual clutch operation.

Try some tight turns in a parking lot and see if you feel any binding or chirping of tires.  Also which engine? the v8 or the 6? 294000 is getting right up there, but I would probably trust the 4.0 for higher mileage.  With jeeps, service is key, don't trust someone 'believing' the engine to rebuilt or replaced. ZJs can run to high mileage but they need regular upkeep. Any service records for this vehicle?

GrandCherokee,2x2qhy,KJax1776,1 point,Wed Feb 25 06:33:29 2015 UTC,"Common rust spot is bottom of doors and rear hatch at the folds (you can grind and repaint that if it's not too far gone).  Behind front wheels at rocker panel under that plastic cover because water goes in through the pinch weld at the back of the wheel wells.  Behind right rear wheel underneath the rear corner (not sure how you'd fix this one).    Also, check the pinion bearings on front and back.  If they move at the yoke, it's about $850 an axle to get the bearings replaced and gears re-setup.  Engine tick will indicate lifter or valve issues.  Any slippage or slow shifts in the transmission will be expensive.  Look for responsive gas and smooth shifts.  It should shift before 2500 rpm when you aren't goosing it.    Hopping when turning sharply on dry pavement indicates a bad VC in the transfercase if its a fulltime Quadratrac.  If it's the Selectrac with the 2WD mode as well as 4PT and 4FT, it's probably fine, it will hop in 4PT but not 2 or 4FT.  This is normal.  These are my favorite ZJ transfercase.  You can pick one up at the junkyard and bolt it right on to replace a bad QT.  You can replace the rocker panels with a welder, or cut them out and weld in box tube for offroading.  That's a lot of miles.  And 27-33 MPG is a complete baldfaced lie.  16-18 and maybe 20 downhill with a tailwind on the highway.  This will be a 4.0L I6 which will never die if maintained and rebuilt about every 150k miles.  But it is not fuel-efficient.  Really, the best thing to do is get a mechanic to look at it that knows what these things are.  Don't be afraid to let it go, there are many around."

Then again I don't know how much I should expect for a sub 2k car? I can see getting nit picky for 4k or more but idk what I should be expecting for 1600. And I don't haggle so I either pay or leave.
GrandCherokee,2x2qhy,ikidd,0,Wed Feb 25 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"Also a non-working speedo means a non-working odometer, so the mileage will be under actual mileage for however long it hasn't worked.  I had a 94 with the I6 for almost 20 years.  If you reset the MPG calculator after you hit highway speed, and didn't have any hills, you might get 22MPG.  And this was when it was new or after an engine rebuild, of which I did 2 before it got killed last year.  I think he's full of shit, but see what shape it's in.  Like I say, there are many around and you're in a good area for finding rust-free ones."

Another gripe was that the installation instructions were next to useless.  I got the bar with three inches of red and black wires coming out the side and no mention of how to wire.  It was intimidating for me as I knew nothing of electrical work.  A few google'd articles fixed that and it turned out really simple.

GrandCherokee,2wuntk,otter_bots,8,Mon Feb 23 07:39:42 2015 UTC,"I like to lock my transmission in first. If I need more pulling power, I'll put the transfer case in low.   You can put the straps on your tow hooks no problem. A hitch mounted shackle is also a good choice. Your hooks can be used if you are being recovered or if you are recovering someone else.   If you're the one being recovered, at least be in neutral. Being in drive to ""help"" would be nice to aid the person in recovering you. I've actually had a person keep their vehicle in Park while I was trying to pull them out.   If possible, don't pull someone out in reverse. Pull the person out going forward. Better control. Plus if something broke, you don't want anything coming straight at you through the windshield.   The use of straps is highly recommended. And even further than that, a strap that doesn't have metal hooks on each end. This goes back to the breaking thing. If the hook broke, it would make a deadly projectile that could come back at either your vehicle or the other persons vehicle. That same logic goes to using chains, which is why chains are not recommended.   Hope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions!"

GrandCherokee,2wuntk,myoverlycreativename,3,Mon Feb 23 08:33:46 2015 UTC,"But if you're in four part time or four low, make sure you don't turn on pavement or you will get drive line binding and potentially damage drive line components."

GrandCherokee,2wsjcu,jeepngun,2,Thu Feb 26 17:59:52 2015 UTC,most services are just a fluid and filter change.  you might have to change the solenoid or some of the sensors.  do it al yourself to save a bunch of money.
GrandCherokee,2wsjcu,jeepngun,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:23:57 2015 UTC,I want to do the fluid change myself but I'm afraid I might not have the skill to take care of it without breaking/ruining the pan or something!  I guess I need to find a mechanic that will let me watch/help as they work on it! Hah!
GrandCherokee,2wsjcu,jeepngun,3,Mon Feb 23 16:36:39 2015 UTC,"first thing I would do is change the transmission speed input and output sensors.  http://youtu.be/TWUqx0FrLtM?list=PL4daIoXWewIRjZO3IVaqA-bPIc-zsqeUM you can get them cheap at outozone. and they install really cheap.  swap both of them out at once. its less of a headache that way.  If that doesn't solve your problem then change the pressure sensor that is on the opposite side.  they call it a few different things and you can usually only get it at the dealer.  its about $70.  sometimes they call it a Governor Pressure Transducer or just a pressure sensor.  Just know that there's only three and this one is on the opposite side of the two speed input and output sensors.  I had to get it at the dealer because autozone didn't have them.  dirve around for a while and if it still doesn't fix it service your transmission and change the solenoid pack.  http://youtu.be/Mzd0Mmv7nBQ?list=PL4daIoXWewIRjZO3IVaqA-bPIc-zsqeUM  http://www.wjjeeps.com/service/transmission.htm  Do things in this order because it will potential save you money because you might fix the problem before having to fix the more expensive parts.  speed sensors: $20 each and 30 min install.... pressure sensor: $70 and 30 min install..... solenoid pack filter and fluid: about $300 and a pain in the ass.  depending on how mechanically inclined you are it could take you an hour or 5.......  in between each of these potential fixes test your jeep out for a few days.  if your lucky you will fix the issue with speed sensors and your done.  if not go to the next fix. drive around and an hopefully that did it.  if that didn't do it go for the last fix.  If the last fix doesn't do it you need to either rebuild that transmission or get a new/ refurbished one.  You can get a rebuild kit for like $900 I think but you have to be pretty mechanically inclined to rebuild your own transmission.  You can pay a shop to install a new/rebuild transmission but they will probably rape you for about $4,000 to $5,000.  If you need a new transmission your best bet is to order one online for about $1900 http://www.autozone.com/powertrain/automatic-transmission/all-trans-automatic-transmission/241033_842121_0_47031/ and install it your self or ask your local comunity collage if their automotive class needs a jeep to work on.  they might be willing to put your transmission in for free provided you don't mind kids that are learning working on your jeep.  take your time and don't dump any unnecessary money into it.  You don't want to hate your jeep!  patience and a positive mental attitude is the first thing you need when working on your own car.  if you get frustrated just walk away!  This should be a fun thing.  drink a few beers and make it fun Saturday or sunday.  if you have a friend that can hang out while you do these things even better.  two heads are better than one and its less frustrating when you can bullshit with a buddy while you work on the jeep.  good luck!"
GrandCherokee,2wsjcu,jeepngun,3,Mon Feb 23 16:14:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, reading your comment again has made me feel so much better! You are 100% right, my jeep should be fun! I am going to take that positive attitude with me and keep from dumping a bunch of money into it like you suggest.  A quick question I'd like to ask is if I should change the solenoid off the bat anyway. I have a small leak in the trans pan gasket which I would like to change out this week (and replace the fluid+filters). Should I change the solenoid once I have everything open anyway>  Edit: Kinda looks like you answered this question for me anyway! Thanks!"
GrandCherokee,2wsjcu,jeepngun,3,Mon Feb 23 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"If your opening it all up anyway I would do it once and for all so you don't have to go through the whole process all over.  Just so you know worst case scenario is that you go through all of this ( sensors, then solenoid, fluid, and filters) and realize you're still gunna need a new trany.  At that point you have to decide if its worth it to you to order a rebuilt trany for about $1700-$1900."
GrandCherokee,2wsjcu,jeepngun,3,Mon Feb 23 20:07:37 2015 UTC,"Fyi.  I went through this whole process recently.  I'm mechanical inclined a little but by no means a mechanic.

GrandCherokee,2wrhfq,manuelferara,2,Sun Feb 22 15:16:45 2015 UTC,"how do your radiators keep going bad? is it the low temperature? or are you getting low quality radiators? I only ask because I recently replaced mine, and I sure hope it doesn't go bad."
GrandCherokee,2wrhfq,TomT12,1 point,Sun Feb 22 16:51:22 2015 UTC,I blame poor quality on the majority of them. My wife's WJ has gone through several also and for the same reason. I only had one leak in the core itself. Everything else was due to plastic failure. I spent extra money on what I considered a quality unit and yet it appears to be a seal failure on the plastic tanks. It seems I end up tearing down either one inside of two years no matter what I buy.
GrandCherokee,2wrhfq,TomT12,2,Sun Feb 22 17:31:31 2015 UTC,I knew immediately you had a HTC one. Mine does the exact same thing :/
GrandCherokee,2wrhfq,hotdog110,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm not a huge fan of camera phones so it doesn't bother me as much as some. I love how HTC talked about solutions for it in 2013, but moved on."
GrandCherokee,2wrhfq,hotdog110,2,Sun Feb 22 18:33:19 2015 UTC,I believe the only solution they found was to replace the entire sensor. I'm waiting for this years HTC one to upgrade.
GrandCherokee,2wohyu,Jinga1,2,Sat Feb 21 19:04:04 2015 UTC,Nice! I love that color. I've been dealing with similar conditions in Virginia
GrandCherokee,2wohyu,SirLaxer,2,Sat Feb 21 21:32:29 2015 UTC,Awesome ride!! I'm in Maryland.
GrandCherokee,2wohyu,MaximumAbsorbency,2,Sun Feb 22 01:17:48 2015 UTC,"We got about 8 inches up here (south of Baltimore), I wish I had a reason to drive around :("

GrandCherokee,2wo76m,codysolorio,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:34:31 2015 UTC,Gorgeous! V6?
GrandCherokee,2wo76m,fweepa,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:38:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, V6. Super smooth so far!"
GrandCherokee,2wo76m,apollo_2000,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:46:32 2015 UTC,"I though the limiteds all had 20inch 5 spoke wheels, they look like 18inch laredo wheels? Or is that just in Australia?"
GrandCherokee,2wo76m,apollo_2000,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:38:20 2015 UTC,To my knowledge the Limited 2x4s come with the 20 inch wheels while the 4x4s come with the 18 inch.
GrandCherokee,2wpntu,BobV1la,2,Sun Feb 22 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"I would at least do the measurements and find out what a complete Tom Woods kit would cost before you spend a dime doing it yourself. You can do some serious damage with even a small mistake.  http://www.4xshaft.com/   Tom Woods is known for talking to people for hours, maybe he will even answer your exact question."
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,GranfatherGlock,1 point,Sat Feb 21 03:57:52 2015 UTC,Exactly my definition of these Jeeps... And it's got even more potential! Take care!
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,C33X,1 point,Sat Feb 21 11:39:58 2015 UTC,"Looks great!  Fellow ZJ owner,  I love mine as much too!How much lift is that?  What wheels/tires are you running?"
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,Urtoo,2,Sat Feb 21 16:27:33 2015 UTC,About 4ish with 33x12.50r15 KM2 on 15x8 D Window steelies.
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,mantich92,0,Sat Feb 21 16:54:36 2015 UTC,Iknow I've asked before but...there's no trimming on your 33's right? I have the inner fender lining out any way
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,mantich92,2,Sun Feb 22 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"They are trimmed. Behind the bumper , an inch or so on the fender , and the pinch seam was cut and folded. So much room for activities! The rear is only folded."
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,Chthonian5,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:30:16 2015 UTC,I will keep that in mind when I get mine
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,Chthonian5,1 point,Sun Feb 22 05:32:22 2015 UTC,Is that an Alpha Romero? What year?
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,Chthonian5,2,Sat Feb 21 17:31:41 2015 UTC,1958 Alfa Romeo Giulleta Spyder. It's a restoration I'm doing.
GrandCherokee,2wmgqe,ikidd,1 point,Sat Feb 21 17:32:45 2015 UTC,Beauty! Looks like it's missing an engine.
GrandCherokee,2wk0ka,masterslacker42,6,Fri Feb 20 15:41:33 2015 UTC,The last grand that COULD flex  (from the factory)  Love me some WJ.
GrandCherokee,2wk0ka,Zephid15,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:18:14 2015 UTC,Undo the swaybar and see what it does.  Just watch the brakelines in front don't stretch too far and snap.
GrandCherokee,2wk0ka,ikidd,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:45:21 2015 UTC,How do you disconnect the sway bar? Can I do that with my 2000 WJ?
GrandCherokee,2wk0ka,Why_am_I_SO_White,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:32:55 2015 UTC,"Yes you can.  There are links on the front swaybar that connect it to the axle on each side.  The swaybar is the U shaped bar strapped to the frame and pointing towards the back with arms over each side in front of the axle with the links coming down to the axle.  Typically offroad ready vehicles will have easy removal pins, but you can take them off with a couple wrenches or sockets.  Be sure to put it back together before you get back on the road, if you make a sudden turn the vehicle will sway (hence the name) and could flip if you turn sharp enough.  Unlikely, but possible."
