nba,3e10t2,Cloud9rc,2,Tue Jul 21 08:09:28 2015 UTC,"(The Wire spoilers)  It was definitely different. At first I found it a little bit boring since it spent time away from the characters that we cared about. But they did a lot of interesting things; I really enjoyed Frank's character in particular.  He was just so complex and multi-faceted. I also loved most of the prison stuff with D, that Gatsby thing was great. And like season 1, the way everything came together at the end was nice, though it wasn't as tight.   I wasn't as much of a fan of the stuff with Nick and Ziggy though, so I can't say I liked it quite as much as Season 1. Not that they were bad characters or poorly acted but... they (especially Ziggy) struck me as a little one-note and not really as interesting. I also wasn't a fan of the villains... I never found them to be as interesting or charismatic as Stringer & co (which is probably the point).  Also not sure whether this is a bad thing or not, but by Season 2 I had a good feel for the writing style of the show and I just knew when a character is going to die. They love their Greek tragedy and character arcs are often structured that way.  So yeah, I'd say Season 2 was a bit weaker than Season 1, but still way better than most other TV."
nba,3e10t2,justgivingsomeadvice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:09 2015 UTC,"Most people seem to rate season 2 as their least favorite after their first watching of the entire show because it's so different compared to the others (seasons 3-5 go back to the streets, so you'll be happy to hear that), but the second time around, you'll enjoy it much more because you can see the importance of it within the context of the whole show and how it relates to the story's central themes. Personally, I would rank them in order of most favorite to least favorite as 4-3-2-5-1 and I've watched the show three times. But I love them all."

There was obviously mixed reactions from people who agreed to people who became defensive and said I was being racially sensitive.   I feel like you can brush it aside by saying you're just being descriptive, but the undertone I get from posts like this is that only a Chinese girl would be weird enough to spend tens of hours pushing pins into a Boris Diaw art piece.

When you watch him play on offense, he is constantly moving to improve passing lanes.  A lot of young bigs stand around as someone penetrates, almost clogging the lane.  WCS watches where his man rotates, sees where the guy is driving in, and adjusts to form a good angle for the outlet.  He also showed a lot of intelligence as the roll-man, always going hard to the right place on the court.    On defense, he obviously has a great knack for positioning.  His head is constantly on a swivel and he uses his athleticism to clog driving and passing lanes.  I felt he had just as much impact on disrupting offenses from his positioning as he did from being a rim-protecting threat.  It's hard to quantify the effects of that, but if you spend time watching it's clear that he does a lot just by moving to the right place at the right time.  The one drawback is that he often over-commits and uses his athleticism to recover.  I'm sure that worked in college, but a few times he wasn't able to completely recover and ended up out of place."
nba,3e2e0n,TwoChe,14,Tue Jul 21 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, being honest WCS would probably have ended up the best receiver in the NFL, I mean no one's stopping a 7 foot guy with that kind of speed.  That being said, he definitely made the right choice sticking with basketball.  Good money, no brain injury, it's really the life."

nba,3e2e0n,CaptainHawkmed,4,Tue Jul 21 15:09:44 2015 UTC,Hahahaha so true.  I guess how the Stanimal pans out will show us whether or not the insanity paid off.
nba,3e2e0n,N1celyDunn,31,Tue Jul 21 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"WCS's biggest hurdle right now would be how much of the game he gets.  He's athletically an excellent defensive player and is generally good to great around the ball, but it'll interesting to see how he handles teams throwing different looks at him.  Offensively it was nice to see Cauley-Stein stay in his lane so to speak.  He has the physical tools to be an effective dive man in pick and rolls, but whether he has the head for it is another thing, which is the major concern going forward for him.  Still think he's an awkward fit next to Cousins (even if he reaches his potential).  I haven't made it much of a secret how highly I think of Mudiay and going to the Nuggets and Malone seem to be kind of a blessing.  His shot still needs some work.  In the SL his biggest problem was keeping his base straight (that split thing he does with his legs when he's off balance is weird), but his general form is much better than it was this time last year.  But he does so many good things that his shot can take a little time to develop.  My favorite play of mine I saw was him hooking around the screen then coming back and running his defender into the screen again.  He does so many high level point guard things that it's hard to fathom he's only 19.  Stanley Johnson is the most composed rookie I think I've ever seen in the Summer League.  It wasn't an issue of him letting the game come to him (or forcing things) but he just had a clear view of everything that was happening on the court and how he was effecting it (or supposed to).  He looked like one of those 2nd or 3rd year players who's absorbed too much NBA knowledge for the Summer League to really challenge him anymore.  Yeah, Kaminsky's biggest obstacle is going to be strength on both ends of the court.  Still, he showed he belongs athletically and his shooting from the 4 will always have a spot in the league coupled with his deceptively good off the bounce game and just general smarts.  I always felt people overstated how good Winslow was going into the draft and what his ceiling was going to be, but he looks like he should project into a great glue guy, a player who is able to hold a team together by just keeping things flowing and working hard (possibly more if he can get his ball skills sharpened).  His shot was a bit of a mirage in college and considering he didn't shoot that frequently was more of an extended hot streak than anything."
nba,3e2e0n,alsghd0408,9,Tue Jul 21 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely excited to see how WCS can evolve as an intelligent defender. He has all the tools and seems like he has a very natural feel on the defensive end (timing of help defense, where to be in the lane and hedging screens), but it will be interesting to see if he can get his defensive IQ to a Marc Gasol-type level combined with his athleticism.   I am interested in why you think WCS in an awkward fit with Demarcus. I can understand how someone would think that, but do you also think Deandre is an awkward fit with Blake?  I agree with you on most of your other points as well. I didn't see much of Mudiay, but as a Kings' fan there was some worry from me, even with how much I like WCS, that we might pass up the next Russell Westbrook and he looks to be showing that he is gonna be an all-star in this league.  Stanley was also my top wing. I like Winslow as well, but Stanley is so physically imposing and IMO his weakness coming in were his offensive abilities that weren't exactly showcased well at Arizona with their crowded offense (they had like 2 good shooters on the team and Stanley rarely shared the court with more than 1 of them). I think Detroit got themselves a great player going forward and I like him pairing with SVG to get him there."
nba,3e2e0n,kgriffin44,4,Tue Jul 21 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"I just think it's weird trying to fit Cousins into the 4 spot because he's always seemed like a natural center to me.  Once WCS figures things out on defense, I think they'll be fine on that end (especially if Cousins is dialed in) because it's starting to look like WCS can easily guard either big spot and just cover a ton of ground on defense.  But my main concern would be on offense.  Having WCS out there is going to provide very little space and it's going to force Cousins further away from the basket.  And he's capable away from the basket, he's better when it's a change of pace rather than it being the set position.  Again, it just seems odd moving Cousins out of the 5, I could be wrong but it looks like their offense isn't going to be particularly pretty or efficient next season.  But I'm a lot higher on WCS than I was a month ago."
nba,3e2e0n,FriedVitamins,2,Tue Jul 21 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm definitely a little worried about the offense.  If WCS could develop even a really slow releasing 16-18 footer that could go a long way. Cousins played next to Thompson a lot and I think that kept some spacing alive because JT could knock down that short baseline jumper, but it will definitely be interesting to see what we do on offense and how often we put Rudy at the 4."
nba,3e2e0n,zombat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:48:18 2015 UTC,You have to remember cousins can play the 4 or 5 just like WCS. Cousins first season he played te 4 with Samuel Dalembert playing center and it worked great.. I would honestly keep cousins at the 5 and put WCS at the 4 because he is laterally much quicker than cousins. I feel people keep putting WCS at the 5 because of his height but really he would be a better 4 because he is not overly strong enough for the 5 yet and is capable of keepin up with the 4

nba,3e2e0n,Halbridious,11,Tue Jul 21 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"This is great stuff man.   I'd also say that WCS needs a lot of work rebounding. For such an athletic guy, who is always around the ball, he should be getting his hands on more. Right now it looks like he is mostly getting by on his athleticism. Which is fine for summer league, but the season will be a different story."
nba,3e2e0n,Halbridious,13,Tue Jul 21 14:30:12 2015 UTC,We still have Cousins who is a great rebounder and a lot of times WCS is guarding players away from the basket which affects his rebound numbers negatively.
nba,3e2e0n,Halbridious,4,Tue Jul 21 14:59:42 2015 UTC,Plus he was (imo) clearly being instructed to not crash the defensive boards and get out on the break.
nba,3e2e0n,Thurstian,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely true, his rebounding totals were pretty low.  He has the strength, height, and vertical to be a great rebounder if he just puts it all together though, and I'm sure that's something his coaches will stress to him.  If he plays starter minutes in the NBA I don't see him averaging fewer than 7.5 rpg."
nba,3e2e0n,sriranjant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he did have the same issues in college. So maybe pro coaching will help, but there's also the chance that he is never a good rebounder."

nba,3e2e0n,riva707,3,Tue Jul 21 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"If he consistently boxes out so the team gets the rebound, it's a overall plus in my opinion. You don't have to be a great rebounder to contribute in that way.   I don't know if he has been boxing out, many tall players don't get into that habit. Just making a remark."

Dude can switch and keep up with PGs for a possession, or cover a wing dude if necessary. I legitimately think he has All-Defense potential, possible DPOY."
nba,3e2e0n,dL1727,10,Tue Jul 21 14:34:35 2015 UTC,"Oh totally.  People always talk about which players can cover the 1-5, and WCS is the definition of a guy who can do that.  Absolutely lethal help defender.  One of the most versatile defensive rookies we've seen in a while."
nba,3e2e0n,fuzzynavel34,13,Tue Jul 21 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"Stanimal is making me happier and happier.   High efficiency scoring displayed in SL because he was very poised, had a high IQ when it came to what shots to take and give up.  Looked to be in great form.  Defensively couldn't get enough, guy was a monster defending a lot of less athletic guys on the floor.  WCS is going to be the steal of the draft though.  Loved him in college, and if he can maintain being a solid pick/roll and cutter from that 4-5 position around boogie his offense is NOT going to be an issue.  As a pistons fan, saw a lot of the moose/drummond big2big passing last year, and if boogie and WCS can find that together it'll be really great.  Dribble handoffs from a post threat to a dominate athlete like WCS are nearly unstoppable."
nba,3e2e0n,era650,2,Tue Jul 21 15:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, gonna be honest I think all the 6-8 guys were huge steals.  I'd probably have to call Mudiay or Stanimal the most likely to be the steal of the draft, but you can't go wrong with any of them."
nba,3e2e0n,Doordoor123,3,Tue Jul 21 15:16:20 2015 UTC,"Given all the stuff with Ty Lawson, Mudiay falling into the nuggets lap is the best they can ask for honestly, can come right in and run a high-tempo slash and kick offense right away."

nba,3e2e0n,riva707,2,Tue Jul 21 15:30:36 2015 UTC,"I think Russell is going to be better than most people think, but Mudiay certainly proved that he was more NBA-Ready right now.  We've got 4 really great competitions between picks this year, with Stanimal/Winslow (hopefully w/ W stan proving he was the right choice for DET) Towns/Okafor (my guess is Okafor has a better first year but Towns is an all star first) Mudiay/Russell, and the foreigners Hezonja and Porzingod.    Always love when we get those LeBron/Melo competitions amongs draftees.  Still waiting on last years Wiggins/Parker to truely develop, I loved Wiggins but really thought Parker was going to do better year one.  Damn injuries."

WCS playing the 5 with Cousins at the 4 doesn't create much spacing, and would push Cousins further away from the basket. He's still good away from the basket, but not as good as when he can get in close.   Seems like a perfect compliment would be a defensive 4 that can shoot."

nba,3e2e0n,chubbupp,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"Stanley Johnson won't be a superstar, but will be a good starter in the league. Guys in the NBA will swallow up his offense (especially first unit defenders). i don't think he's a good enough passer to create with better, stronger, quicker, longer defenders on the other team and I don't think he'll be able to create for himself with the speed he has. In college he drove by using his body, but the NBA has stronger guys and I don't think he's going to be able to overpower players like he did in the summer league and college. He looked great in summer league, but I don't think it's translatable to the NBA."
nba,3e2e0n,dL1727,7,Tue Jul 21 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"I've got to say I disagree.  Stanley's shooting looks like it's come a long way, and while I'm not saying he's a future scoring champ, I think he'll be quite formidable on that end of the ball.  Even at the NBA level, I think his hustle will allow him to crash the offensive boards which will translate into putbacks.  Honestly, I see him ending up a lot like Kawhi.  An elite defender who's great on the glass for a small forward and has a good offensive skillset despite not being a star on that end of the floor."
nba,3e2e0n,subtle_penguin,-3,Tue Jul 21 14:29:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he'll be a bad shooter at all. The question is more, to be a superstar you need to be able to 1) create for others and 2) create for yourself. As of now, I don't think he can do either at the NBA level. And I think his lack of athleticism limits him. And on the defensive end, he's no Kawhi Leonard. He isn't as long, as quick or athletic. If you want to look at future Khawhi, look out for Kelly Oubre. Johnson is convinced he'll be able to defend fours, but he won't. He could possibly out-hustle small ball fours though. I'm not saying he'll be bad by any means, but he doesn't have the physical talents to be great in the NBA and I think his summer league performance was fools gold."
nba,3e2e0n,EL1CASH,8,Tue Jul 21 14:40:03 2015 UTC,"Again, I totally disagree.  I think Stanley has the physical tools to be an absolutely elite defender in the NBA (He has almost the exact measurements of Draymond Green, this year's DPOY runner-up), and his hustle is what will really separate him from the rest.  He's shown great block timing and the ability to hold his own and stay in front of his man in the paint at every level, and I think his vertical ability should more than make up for a lack of length.  Plus, he's a really underrated athlete.  He's built like an ox and has great strength for a wing player.  While he'll probably end up being a great defender in more the style of Ron Artest than Kawhi, I think there's no doubt we're looking at an all-defense guy."
nba,3e2e0n,iredditbetter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:40 2015 UTC,"He looks slightly a little too slow. I agree his strength is awesome but its the summer league.

But if you look into the numbers, on a per minute basis, Harden didn't actually score that much more at all. He scored 26.8 points per 36 minutes, compared to 26.2 for Curry. So all he really did significantly better last year was play more minutes, which allowed him to gain an advantage in scoring numbers.  Oh and your point doesn't make sense anyways.

Looking at the threads about the Warriors lately, it's clear that some people still give them little credit and think their wins (including MVP and EOTY) were a sham. I mean, they were going on win streaks and beating great teams before all the injuries, I don't understand why people think they lucked their way into the championship. They beat the Rockets 8-1 last season. The Rockets are a Top 7 team.   Anyway, good on Harden for winning this. He deserves some recognition for his great season."
nba,3e35xw,probablynotdude,17,Tue Jul 21 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ever since the announcement of MVP, the 2 sides have been in a cycle. It has been pretty weird."
nba,3e35xw,MindOnTheBall,11,Tue Jul 21 17:43:37 2015 UTC,I'm not upset over Steph winning. The Warriors were one of the 10 greatest teams of all time (at least statistically speaking). I'm just really glad Harden gets some recognition for carrying the team during the season and playing great.
nba,3e35xw,gibisee4,3,Tue Jul 21 18:21:44 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly call in Championship Syndrome. When you win the Finals, there is going to be something that fans will hate you for. Heck even with us Spurs. It was minor, but there was a lot of hate on Spurs fans after the Finals win, and a weird number of people shit-talking Pop. Not excessive, but it was there. When you win, people celebrate. Afterwards, though, other fans can get pretty annoyed for some reason.    I'd argue the only team that didn't get hated on here when they won the Finals were the Mavericks in 2011. 1.) Because they knocked out the Heat after that whole Decision debacle, and 2.) Everyone was just happy to see Dirk get his ring."

There were plenty of great players this year: Harden, Steph, CP3, Davis, Westbrook were all deserving of recognition and everyone just wants to make sure that their boy is recognized.  Guys, just because someone recognizes that another player was awesome this year doesn't mean they're talking trash about your guy.  If I say Harden deserved MVP, Im not saying Steph wasn't deserving, I'm just saying, watching around 60 Warriors games and 80 Rockets games, I think Harden deserved it a little more."

nba,3e35xw,illegal_deagle,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:28 2015 UTC,Scoring title as far as I know has always been ppg with some threshold to qualify for it. Harden scored more total because he avoided injury  it's not an award based on durability so I don't know why people are upset about it. Sim pretty sure the same situation happened when Carmelo won a few years back. Kd had more total points but a slightly lower points per game number.  Also Westbrook had to do at least an equal amount of the load offensively for the thunder since they had similar injury luck to the rockets this past season.

nba,3e35xw,UnbiasedExpert,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"""who is the player who carried his team all over the season?"" is just one way of interpreting the question. Obviously Harden wins that metric, but you can't fault Curry for being on a team that is already decent.   For example, if a prime Michael Jordan played on this years Warriors, he'd probably increase them from 67 wins to like 75 wins. He wouldn't be carrying the team but I think he would still be more valuable than Harden."
nba,3e35xw,rjvir,5,Tue Jul 21 18:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah the question is not ""who caarried his team all over the season?"" its ""who was the most valuable player?"" it may not seem like it but there is a world of difference."
nba,3e35xw,HateHater77,2,Tue Jul 21 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"there is no clear definition of what is it to be the most valuable player, carrying the team seems like something similar to me."

nba,3e35xw,ChemLok,-13,Tue Jul 21 18:55:23 2015 UTC,So you actually think harden deserved MVP this year?
nba,3e35xw,DanerysFlacco,13,Tue Jul 21 17:46:49 2015 UTC,"You're saying that like Harden for MVP is a stupid opinion. I was on the fence the whole season. I thought Steph ultimately deserved it due to the fact that he's the engine of the offense of a 67-win team. Nothing they do works without him, and the on/off court stats show how much they Dubs suffer without him on the floor. The Warriors had a dozen more wins than the 2nd seed Rockets and 7 more wins than the Hawks. Looking at the on/off stats, it's clear that they don't come close to making history without Curry.   But with that said, Harden (and tremendously underrated Rockets team defense) did allow a very injured team to make it to the 2nd seed. Harden balled his heart out and got his team home advantage for most of the playoffs."
nba,3e35xw,probablynotdude,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"I do not think it was nearly as close as people make it seem. I think the seed argument is a terrible one when the rockets were closer to the 8th seed then they were to the 1st seed. If a team dominates the nba this much and there is one player that can be easily pointed to as to why they are, that player will almost certainly win MVP."
nba,3e35xw,DanerysFlacco,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:04 2015 UTC,The seeding was extremely tight this year.  1 or 2 games made the difference for a lot of teams. I don't think that argument is solid against harden. Steph and the Warriors being #1 all year is better proof for him imo
nba,3e35xw,hollaatyourgirl,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:03 2015 UTC,Yea that is my point exactly.  The Rockets being the 2 seed makes it seem like they were close to the Warriors in regular season performance.
nba,3e35xw,DanerysFlacco,4,Tue Jul 21 18:46:23 2015 UTC,I think that is what OP is hinting at. Do you not think he deserved MVP if he got it?
nba,3e35xw,MindOnTheBall,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:55:29 2015 UTC,Based on the history of the award I think it would of been wrong to have given it to Harden.
nba,3e35xw,DanerysFlacco,4,Tue Jul 21 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"Wrong? Come on man. He was a top-2 seed and we won the toughest division. I'm not even going to get into the injuries and things like that. That is like saying if Harden won it, Steph didn't deserve it. They were both deserving and either getting it isn't some abomination."
nba,3e35xw,MindOnTheBall,0,Tue Jul 21 18:05:26 2015 UTC,Based on the awards history I said it would be wrong.  I do not really know how you can even argue that.
nba,3e35xw,DanerysFlacco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"The number 1 seed doesn't automatically have the MVP, come on man.  There have been plenty if examples of the number 1 seed not getting it.   Shit, Boston was far and away the best team in 2008 (I think 65-67 wins) and the MVP race was pretty much Chris Paul and Kobe (Who I believe both teams won 56 or less games)  I'm away from the computer right now so I can't fact check"
nba,3e35xw,MindOnTheBall,0,Tue Jul 21 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"Yea but Harden's numbers were not better than Curry's and the difference in wins makes the choice obvious imo. ( again according to the awards history)  Also Curry is the unquestioned best player on the Warriors this season while the skill gap between players 1, 2, and 3, were much closer on the Celtics."
nba,3e35xw,DanerysFlacco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"That's kinda true.   According to statistical analysis giving the award to harden this year would have been an all time snub:   The difference between Curry and Harden’s MVP-Q values is 19.7%. This would have been 148% the snub either of the above were. It’s was fun to argue but this was not a close MVP race.   giving Karl malone instead of jordan in 96' for example, would've only been a 13% snub.   http://www.scribd.com/doc/264138012/Why-Curry-Won"
nba,3e35xw,DatDissonance,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:38 2015 UTC,I do not mean to say what Harden did was not impressive either I just think how close the MVP race was this past year was somewhat fabricated.
nba,3e35xw,DanerysFlacco,0,Tue Jul 21 18:47:45 2015 UTC,And I agree.   The most thorough analysis I've read so far concluded that curry was:  A better Scorer -   http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25132691/the-mvp-debate-whos-a-better-scorer-james-harden-or-steph-curry  A better passer and defender -   http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25140193/mvp-debate-part-two-curry-vs-harden-passing-and-defense  And although Curry has a better team he took them to a much better season (10 wins difference).
nba,3e35xw,DatDissonance,3,Tue Jul 21 18:54:06 2015 UTC,"I do. Warriors without Steph are still a playoff team, rockets without Harden are mid lottery. That said, Steph had an amazing season with historically great shooting. Meanwhile LeBron is still LeBron and is the best player in the nba. There are plenty of arguments for all 3, but I think Harden meant the most to his team last year"
nba,3e35xw,ziggy8392,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"I think without Curry the Warriors are somewhere in the 7-9 seed area. And I agree the Rockets don't make the playoffs, however it's not like where they finished were close. The Warriors dominated the regular season so much that the second seed was not even close to them. I attribute more to a player than takes a team from mediocre to all time great than a player who takes a team from lottery to a playoff team."

Kerr precided over the greatest single-season improvement of a 50-win team in NBA history, with a roster that was largely the same as the year before. Their offense went from 13th best to best in the league because of brilliant offensive systems that were seen from day one.

John Wall won't be voting for these reasons and I'm sure some other players will feel the same or show the bias he talks about."

nba,3e35xw,VegasRon,4,Tue Jul 21 17:52:26 2015 UTC,"There are stats that are good for measuring defense, but simple things like blocks, steals, and rebounds don't paint the whole picture, and can actually negatively influence how we should actually view basketball.  The real two numbers you want to look at for defense, that I'm sure morey looks at, are opponent fg% and how often they took shots against a defender vs other defenders (per minute). Stats matter, you just have to find the right ones."
nba,3e35xw,akushdakyng,9,Tue Jul 21 17:11:01 2015 UTC,Harden was top 10 in defensive win shares last year so I guess he's a top 10 defender right?
nba,3e35xw,Zosoer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:20 2015 UTC,"The fact that his Defensive Rating and DPM weren't in the Top 20, his WS/48 was far lower than Curry's, and his usage rate was sixth would suggest that his Defensive Win Share count was the result of quantity, not quality.  Granted, a season's worth of pretty good defense is impressive for a player as offensively oriented as Harden."
nba,3e35xw,siphillis,0,Tue Jul 21 17:12:09 2015 UTC,his WS/48 was far lower than Curry's   Uh how did Curry get thrown in this?
nba,3e35xw,Zosoer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"Point of comparison.  Curry trails Harden in both Offensive and Defensive Win Shares, but somehow still leads him in WS/48.  That would suggest that Harden's Defensive Win Shares are, relatively, inflated by usage."

nba,3e35xw,siphillis,0,Tue Jul 21 17:53:01 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call his stat lines inflated when comparing them to Curry. Harden's usage rate was necessary to keep our team afloat while Curry could take off an extra 4 minutes a game because their team was usually in the lead. Harden's volume of work is extremely justifiable. Maybe if he was on the Warriors and put up the same stats it would be considered inflated. A decrease in efficiency is usually an effect of an increase in usage rate so it's not abnormal that Harden's win shares aren't on the same pace as Curry's per 48.
nba,3e35xw,Zosoer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you, but I'm just gonna point out that the voters (NBA players) on average probably care less about defensive analytics than most people in this thread. That's not at all to say that they're right, and in my personal opinion player voting would be even less accurate than the current system. But players vote on how they feel playing against them. If Jordan is well liked, and feels really imposing on D, he'll win, whether analytics say that he is stellar or in reality a huge liability. Players don't care."
nba,3e35xw,Ziddletwix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"numbers dont' tell the whole story though. clippers have virtually no plus defenders outside of DJ and CP and a horrible bench last year.

nba,3e0yj8,BeckonJM,63,Tue Jul 21 07:16:29 2015 UTC,"Becky wins a championship as a rookie coach, following Steve Kerr's rookie win (who also learned from Pop).   Becky is heir apparent to Pop confirmed. First female coach to win an NBA Championship by 2025. The prophecy reads true..."
nba,3e0yj8,rocksteadybebop,9,Tue Jul 21 03:20:17 2015 UTC,2041 every coach in the nba is from the pop coaching tree
nba,3e0yj8,greg9683,12,Tue Jul 21 12:56:26 2015 UTC,Messina is first in line if he still wants to coach five years from now.
nba,3e0yj8,ec2xs,24,Tue Jul 21 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a watershed moment, but it's really great that the players responded to her so well.  Hopefully will broaden the landscape for who organizations interview in the future."
nba,3e0yj8,SharpsExposure,8,Tue Jul 21 03:18:32 2015 UTC,If you buy into the idea of Spurs looking for guys who work in their system is there not a better litmus test than seeing how they handle playing for a female coach? If they can fall in line for Hammond they'll have no trouble doing it with Pop and the first team.
nba,3e0yj8,longb123,9,Tue Jul 21 12:40:51 2015 UTC,That's a great point. Anyone who would dismiss a coach for being a woman and not treat her with respect is not the kind of person that belongs in San Antonio.
nba,3e0yj8,xkoalasx,10,Tue Jul 21 13:03:34 2015 UTC,"This! As someone with a sister that has played(collegiate) and coached bball, I love it.

nba,3e0yj8,steeledl,5,Tue Jul 21 04:54:01 2015 UTC,Big chance. Kawhi and Danny gonna start and then you got Manu off the bench with probably limited minutes and games off. Then some rotation of Simmons and Anderson for the other Wing spot.... but Simmons is more NBA ready has the ability to do the things Spurs need as far as his playmaking ability.

I might also give some love to the end of G2 WCF with the defense on Harden in the final seconds but maybe that's just because I was there.  My justification would be: 1) could've easily changed tide of series 2) defense by our two best offensive players symbolized a season where our defense was underrated but instrumental to success.

Not quite athletic enough to wow you, but no slouch. Which is basically what you can say about a lot of his game. I think at about his 6th or 7th year in the league people are going to be very surprised at just how good Harris is going to be. Mentally he is all there, and his drive to improve is obvious. Very excited about this upcoming season, despite the fact that they are still going to lose a lot."
nba,3e2g1o,Ellimistopher,9,Tue Jul 21 14:17:04 2015 UTC,"I get why he might like writing/watching the Magic, they're such an oddball team of pieces.  It's also really easy to see how this group of players will succeed but by the same token it's just as easy to see how it all falls apart.  There's a lot of variance with the talent they have collected here (and that's fun).  I like Harris in a vacuum but I like him even better paired with Gordon (especially as Gordon gets his confidence up and has apparently improved his jump shot).  I'm curious to see if the Magic toy with the idea of playing Dipo at the 1 again this season as a way to get him on the floor with Hezonja, Gordon, and Harris."

I've seen a lot of Melo comparisons for Tobias, and granted, I have compared him to Melo at times too, but mainly size comparison.   Tobias is somewhat the opposite of Melo. And I think it works for him. And he's gonna have a great career in the NBA. This is not to say Melo's style of play is bad, I'm just saying that Tobias doesn't really play like Melo."

nba,3e2g1o,why_rob_y,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:44 2015 UTC,The comparison is really in the size. He does bully smaller 3s on the block. Always getting his own offensive rebound cause he's just stronger and bigger than most 3s. Melo does the same thing.
nba,3e2g1o,ItoldonAnneFrank,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's really the opposite of Melo either because that would be Manu Ginobili or something.  It's not really black or white. It seems like Harris has some Melo tendencies to his game, but he just struggles with the extra pass most of the time.   I'll be honest I don't watch much of Melo or Tobias Harris, but I also only think Melo ""stalls out the offense"" because of the system in place. On team USA I don't think Melo struggled with Iso play and not making the extra pass, but when the play is run a wing PnR or get it to him and let him go to work, I don't know how much that's on Melo or how much that should be on the coach.  We don't really call KD out because he has Russ and they play 2-man game really well, but KD and Melo have a ton of similariities when it comes to ball-stopping. Same with Kobe and Lebron. All elite 1-on-1 scorers do and it just comes down to how they run the offense through them."

nba,3e2g1o,LamarMatic,5,Tue Jul 21 13:11:02 2015 UTC,"I hope the Magic can find some defensive identity under Skyles.   They've got a really nice young core, and a couple couple good defenders already in there, plenty of versatility and size at different positions, so it's not out of the question. I don't hold out much hope for Vucevic on that end (he can be really frustrating). They might not be a juggernaut but they can definitely make some improvements."

nba,3e2g1o,Halbridious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's the result of a mind set that will (hopefully) decline as he learns to trust his team. If there is an opening where he can get his shot, he is decisive. If there isn't a clear way to get his shot, he tends to poke around instead of keeping the ball moving."
nba,3e2g1o,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,0,Tue Jul 21 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"Except, as he showed in the gif, Harris is stopping the ball so much as moving into space and away from the screen that gives the defense time to recover instead of forcing them to adjust again (by going into the screen).  That's a poor decision albeit a quick one rather than holding on to the ball and letting the defense catch up.  It's a good thing Harris is on the move that quickly, the Magic just need him to recognize that it's more beneficial to search out screens like that."
nba,3e2g1o,stevelevets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"If he passed more, perhaps Harris could be a score-first version of Draymond Green   But then.. he wouldn't be Dray at all. I never get these comparisons (A ""blank"" version of ""blank"")"

He just needs to do less of the bad things and more of the good things — to trade a few bad jumpers for passes that keep the offense chugging.  Whether he can do that is the biggest question surrounding his game. Harris just got paid, and there is a school of thought among league sources that with money in the bank, he might be a little less greedy on offense. He only turned 23 last week. If he passed more, perhaps Harris could be a score-first version of Draymond Green — a jack-of-all-trades who spaces the floor and works mismatches."

nba,3e2ei6,bring-da-ruckus,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:30 2015 UTC,I think you're forgetting that Ray was a ridiculous playmaker especially in his time with the Bucks & Sonics. His peak years for 3 pointers made were 01-02 with the Bucks and 05-06 with the Sonics.
nba,3e2ei6,HeyYouYoureAwesome,5,Tue Jul 21 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"Ray was a great playmaker, but Curry is better. I'm on my phone so stats are a bitch to look up, but Curry creates his own shot much more than Ray did. Just as an example, in 2012-13 Curry had 60.2% of his 3s assisted compared to 75.1% of Ray's in 2005-2006. It's also worth nothing that Curry hit his shots at a higher percentage. I'm fairly certain he also had more assists, so Curry was better in nearly every sense as a ""playmaker""."

nba,3e0vvl,jimmyking23,30,Tue Jul 21 05:29:26 2015 UTC,ask LeBron  edit: that was kind of a smartass answer but now i'm legitimately wondering... is there anything to stop Ballmer from signing CP3/Blake (or DJ) to a huge Microsoft contract like LeBron's Samsung endorsement deal? seems fucked
nba,3e0vvl,querceton,16,Tue Jul 21 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"i feel like if that happened and the league found out they would try to investigate if there was some sort of under the table deal that happens when the player signed, like Ballmer told CP3 to take less than the max, il sign you to a microsoft contract to make it up.   and then take their draft picks? thats what happened to the wolves and their under the table deal right?"
nba,3e0vvl,jimmyking23,5,Tue Jul 21 06:57:09 2015 UTC,"just sign them to gaudy Microsoft endorsement deals mid-contract that end a year after their Clippers deals do, then let the chips fall as they may   edit 1: it isn't like a shoe deal where the player has a ton of leverage because they specifically endorse a signature product, it's just their goodwill and celebrity, or natural talent in the case of someone like Blake  $100M contract to endorse the Surface, XBone, Windows Band, Windows Phone, etc. That's free money, it's not like Apple is knocking down his door (nor would they). Throw that to him (with the strategic end date of course) he's a company man for sure.   edit 2: this is different than the timberwolves situation because ballmer has one of the most legit front operations ever ready to go at a moment's notice. assets might be structured such that it's not technically even covered by existing rules"

Why couldn't the player simply switch teams and enjoy making the same endorsement money? If Microsoft (in this example) cancelled Chris Paul's endorsement deal right around when he left the Clippers, that would almost definitely lead to an investigation and penalties for the Clippers."
nba,3e0vvl,longb123,4,Tue Jul 21 12:40:30 2015 UTC,That's why you sign him to an endorsement deal that conveniently ends right after his contract with the Clips. I don't think the league could realistically do anything about it as long as they aren't really stupid about it.  Edit: This is all irrelevant because Ballmer can't endorse any NBA player.

He was cut, in the d league with his basketball dreams fading and here comes Pop and company to lift him up and show him how to succeed and gave him the greatest basketball thrills he could hope for (competing for and winning a championship). He knows he owes them a lot.   2) he loves playing where he is. You can't really put a price on being where you want to be.   3) he sees the best players on this team being selfless and accepting team friendly contracts that everyone, especially the fans benefit from. He gets it.   Again, he got paid very well. I'm sure he's more then happy going from almost out of the league to making 40 million dollars. He's a great role player but he's not a star really.

They thrive in a system, and they might not do so well on another team. Danny Green might understand this idea, and will choose system and comfort over trying to make more money. In an extent, it's what DeAndre did. He chose comfort and system over star player and pressure. Unless you've got bonafide superstar blood in you, it's sometimes just better to be a role player.

nba,3e2wlc,the_toe_,18,Tue Jul 21 15:25:36 2015 UTC,No doubt there is a bigger emphasis on 3 point shooting. I expect to see young players coming up more adept at perimeter defense in the next decade.
nba,3e2wlc,bkny88,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"We already see it with the glut of athletic shooters. I think the area where there will be spike is for athletic defensive bigs who can finish at the rim off of the P&amp;R.  It's starting to become obvious that bigs started to be ignored once they lost the primary scoring role because nobody quite knew what they were supposed to do offensively anymore aside from stretch-big, but to be competitive in Today's National Basketball Association you've got to have a defensive big who can not only finish on the roll but also guard the perimeter player on a P&amp;R switch.  The shocking thing about Golden State's success wasn't that they would play small on occasion. It was how critically important Bogut was for their team's success."

nba,3e2wlc,gbana,-7,Tue Jul 21 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a good thing. There is far too much 3 point shooting in the NBA today. Sure, the Warriors won the championship this year, and don't get me wrong they're a phenomenal team, but generally speaking you cannot build a team around three point shooting and expect to win. If you look at nearly every NBA Championship team sans the Warriors of this year none of them based their offenses off three point shooting. Did they have some good shooters? Absolutely. However it was never the focal point of the offense. The Spurs don't rely on three point shooting, Miami didn't rely on three point shooting, the Celtics and the Lakers didn't rely on three point shooting. Orlando did and look where it got them, a 4-1 loss in the 2009 Finals. I think the three point game is becoming too heavily relied upon as an offensive weapon as opposed to a second option like it should be."
nba,3e2wlc,UnfairWalnuts,11,Tue Jul 21 17:17:38 2015 UTC,"If you are saying teams shooting more 3s is not pleasing aesthetically, then that is a matter of opinion.  But if you are saying shooting more 3s makes your offense worse, then you happen to be factually wrong."
nba,3e2wlc,UnfairWalnuts,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:04 2015 UTC,The only team on that list that won a championship by shooting more than 22 three pointers a game is this season's Warriors team. Otherwise the rest of them have 22 and below...so how am I wrong again?
nba,3e2wlc,WangMangosteen,4,Tue Jul 21 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"Look at the 2014 Spurs. Just below league average in attempts (and just a hair under your 22 attempt number), but they shot 39.7% on them.   Nobody (except you) thinks that focusing on 3s means just jacking up every 3 you can. The Spurs definitely did play for the 3, watch some freaking games."
nba,3e2wlc,UnfairWalnuts,-6,Tue Jul 21 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"I do. I watch tons and tons of games. The Spurs have the most aesthetically pleasing offense in the league, but they don't play for the three. There is no way you can say they play for the three, especially not with all of the competent big men they've had come through there. They slash, and work the ball inside, and then kick out for open threes with their role players who can knock down threes. However, is Tony Parker a three point shooter? Is Manu Ginobli? I suppose Tim Duncan and now Lamarcus Aldridge are three point shooters now because that's what the Spurs want to play for is a three point shot. Bro, you can still shoot threes and hit them at a fairly decent rate, and the Spurs do, but they are consistently UNDER the league average in threes attempted per game and they are contenders every single year. That's not a coincidence. Come on man."
nba,3e2wlc,WangMangosteen,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"Look, man, you can say they don't ""play for the three"" all you want, but it's arbitrary fuzzy junk. Try flipping it around. What did they play for? Dunks? Layups? Certainly not post-ups or transition points or midrange jumpers."
nba,3e2wlc,UnfairWalnuts,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:07:57 2015 UTC,"I honestly am at a loss for words. I was going to write a lengthy reply to this but I'm done arguing with you. This is like beating my head against the wall. How the fuck you can be a Spurs fan and say they play for three pointers, while not playing for mid range jumpers and post ups and other efficient shots is beyond me."
nba,3e2wlc,WangMangosteen,6,Tue Jul 21 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'm taking issue with your backwards logic. You've set up a false standard that facts can't meet. You want me to argue that they ""play for the three"", but that's nonsense, because you can't say that they ""play for the post-up"" or the midrange, or any other specific shot, because that's not how the game works.   It's similar to the ""22 attempts!@!!!!!"" thing you're peddling. That's just a number you chose as the standard so you can say ""no team other than the Warriors has won shooting > 22!!!!!!!"". It's not based on anything other than the fact that it seems like support for your argument. And by the way, check the 2013 Heat. They won shooting 22.1 per game."
nba,3e2wlc,Michael_in_Hatbox,3,Tue Jul 21 17:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think you are right in pointing out that the Spurs successfully use their interior players' scoring abilities to improve the quality of their 3 point shooting.    However the point is they do shoot them at a pretty good clip.  I've been looking throught the historical numbers, and they are in the top half in 3PAs every year since Robinson retired.  When you look at line-ups without Duncan on the court, that is usually top 5."
nba,3e2wlc,d3dlyhabitz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:28:05 2015 UTC,You aren't controlling for their pace.  Their three-point attempt rate is consistently in the top half of the league.

nba,3e2wlc,UnfairWalnuts,4,Tue Jul 21 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"This is nonsense.   The recent Spurs, Heat, and Mavs were all fairly heavy on the 3pt shooters.  Where it gets fuzzy is when you say they ""didn't rely"" on 3pt shooting. What the fuck does that mean? They had a high volume of attempts, they intentionally grabbed great shooters, and they set up their offenses such that they could get those guys the ball. Sure, they weren't the Warriors, but they were clearly closer to that than to the 2001 Lakers."
nba,3e2wlc,poolnickv,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:35 2015 UTC,"I mentioned that. The focal point of their offenses is not three point shooting. Good shooting role players are important to every team, but when you focus your offense around it and shoot a ton every game you have a harder time succeeding. Jordan's Bulls teams had good three point shooters, but they didn't shoot a ton of them, the Spurs teams that have won championships have always had good shooters, but again didn't shoot a ton of them. Focusing your offense too heavily on the three point shot causes you to live and die by it and that is not a great recipe for success. How you can possibly say that the Spurs have a high volume of attempts is nonsensical when you see that they rarely taken more than 22 3PA per game? Literally every team on that list that has won a championship outside of this years Warriors has taken 22 3PA or less per game."

But I wont say I'm more intelligent. They know more than me when it comes to sports medicine. But we know the same when it comes to the human body. We all started as general practitioners and then we specialized. I went into anesthesiology and they went into sports medicine. But we can both agree that PG should take it easy for a bit before he can go horse around. Many of my physician colleagues mentioned to me, while we watched his comeback last season, that they should have put him out the whole season for him to fully heal and rehab. I agreed, and then a few weeks later he reinjured him self. Although the 2nd injury was on the left calf, it shows that his body is still readjusting to being normal again. Nerves, muscles, blood, and brain are still relearning how to function together to make PG who PG is, a elite basketball player. I've seen so many of my patients go out after surgery and immediately get into weight lifting or extreme sports and they end up injuring something else, if not the same type of injury. They injure themselves because they haven't given their body the time to readjust to rehab and living normally again. Muscle memory is hindered drastically after a long period of inactivity.   In short, take it easy after major injuries similar to the one PG encountered. Although it was a clean break of the tibia/fibia, the recovery portion of his injury was the part that hindered him the most. Bones mend very quickly, its just the muscle surrounding the bone that is the part that takes a while to develop."

nba,3e164c,LastRedCoat,25,Tue Jul 21 14:52:47 2015 UTC,That was date night with Blake and DJ. The team meeting was them watching Summer League games and Pierce  watching Naked and Afraid.
nba,3e164c,ayeno,65,Tue Jul 21 04:21:24 2015 UTC,It's funny how all these rumors flew around and they were all just waiting around chilling with DeAndre eating chicken. I'm really happy DeAndre stayed. That team is so fun to watch and he's a huge part of it.
nba,3e164c,amad3000,48,Tue Jul 21 04:23:33 2015 UTC,"whats even more funny is everyone on r/nba acting all hard and shit ""deandre is a pussy ass bitch"" and these guys were just playing 2k and eating chicken."
nba,3e164c,TheEpicTurban723,34,Tue Jul 21 04:22:26 2015 UTC,Well the sentiment towards Deandre is still valid.  Refusing to communicate with Dallas/Cuban was a pretty unprofessional thing to do.
nba,3e164c,RavR,11,Tue Jul 21 05:29:30 2015 UTC,Listened to  J.J. Redick interview on Zach Lowe's podcast about this.    J.J. basically said that it's normal for the agent to make that call and he strongly implied that the agent is kind of the source of a good bit of the dysfunction in this situation.
nba,3e164c,white_light-king,4,Tue Jul 21 06:26:34 2015 UTC,"I think that's why more common than people think, usually the agents take care of that, the difference here is that dj was seemingly annoyed with his agent so didn't want to talk to him"
nba,3e164c,marksills,9,Tue Jul 21 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"I thought it was funny. Trolling Mark Cuban is a dangerous path, but this is sports. I also teased a friend super hard about how fucked the Clippers were. We both drank to awful basketball. But Monday morning his team was a contender and mine would be much better off if we even owned our draft picks."
nba,3e164c,rebeltrillionaire,2,Tue Jul 21 15:45:50 2015 UTC,Yeah it was definitely but everyone's acting like they want to fight him and shit. People make mistakes and he had to do what made him happy. He fucked up and owned up to it

nba,3e164c,riva707,7,Tue Jul 21 14:52:50 2015 UTC,That's a gross mischaracterization.  Jordan was raked over the coals for not calling Cuban back.

I just wanted to be there for my friend and hear him out.  I didn’t want to pressure him. It would’ve felt weird. You know how it is with your good friends. I just told him why I thought he was a good fit in L.A., then I said, “Look, man, whatever you want to do, I’ll still be your friend.” And I genuinely meant it. At the end of the day, we’re all human beings. It’s a lot more complicated than picking a jersey. There’s all kinds of pressure from friends, family, agents and people who you just want to make happy.   That's awesome of Blake"

I'm not sorry for changing my mind because I just wanted to do what I think is best for my life and my happiness, but I am sorry that I didn't treat you with the professionalism and respect that you deserve.""

nba,3e13fe,Sir_Auron,41,Tue Jul 21 14:08:52 2015 UTC,The only thing I still can't understand is why he lied to Cuban or why he remained involved in personnel decisions (texting with Cuban about who the Mavs should go after in FA) even after he had called Blake and Doc about potentially coming back.
nba,3e13fe,dirk-41,13,Tue Jul 21 03:55:42 2015 UTC,I blame Doc for this.  I guarantee Doc was telling him not to tip off Cuban or Fegan that anything was up because he was afraid DeAndre would be swayed back to signing with Dallas.    The reality is Doc should have told DeAndre to tell Fegan who could then inform Cuban about DeAndre's change of mind.  But Doc pretty clearly doesn't play by the rules most of the other GMs abide by.
nba,3e13fe,chaplinatemyshoe,49,Tue Jul 21 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"Doc wanted to keep Deandre, he's not telling Deandre to consult his agent who's a friend of Cubans and was telling Doc different stories than Deandre was telling Doc. Dunno how you can criticise Doc as not playing by the rules when there's some shady shit about how the Mavs are working with Fegan"
nba,3e13fe,hazzajames,23,Tue Jul 21 04:18:17 2015 UTC,can't believe people are still trying to paint Doc as the bad guy

Show me ANY sources or validation that even begins to support that Doc was telling him to screw over the Mavs.  That's like me saying: I don't think Cuban is making a big deal out of it, because he obviously did some shady things.  There is no backing, and even if I believe it doesn't make it valid."
nba,3e13fe,InTheMorning_Nightss,5,Tue Jul 21 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"That's like me saying: I don't think Cuban is making a big deal out of it, because he obviously did some shady things. There is no backing, and even if I believe it doesn't make it valid.   What's funny is that there is a guy literally just a couple posts above you saying the Mavs did shady shit, but he's got 45 upvotes and not a word of argument from you.  Meanwhile, someone says that Doc was shady, which you acknowledge is the same thing, they get downvoted pretty heavily and you jump on him quick.  Also, he isn't the only guy you jumped on for calling Doc shady.  When another guy with Mavs flair did that, you responded labeling it speculation and calling them out on being biased.  Again, when the guy with the clippers flair basically did the same thing, we don't see a peep from you.  Take it how you want, but I find this interesting."
nba,3e13fe,watabadidea,0,Tue Jul 21 14:26:47 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I also see a difference.  With the Mavs, there is actually some backing about shady dealings with Cuban/Fegan and in this case Parsons.  I was more pointing out that csquared absolutely pulled it out of his ass without literally ANY validation.  The validation for the possible wrongdoings (and I'm not saying they are HUGE, but they are questionable) against Cuban/Fegan:  1) This isn't the first time their relationship has come into question, and it is not the first time that Fegan supposedly had demands for signing his client.   As I’ve been told, Howard’s agent Dan Fegan did not want Dwight in Houston, preferring instead to steer him to another team. Reportedly, that team was Dallas as the agent has a relationship and comfort level with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Dwight preferred Houston. To seal the deal for the premier free agent, Fegan provided the Rockets a list of needs/demands to bring him here and one of them was to let Chandler Parsons, who also was represented by Fegan, out of his contract this summer rather than wait until 2015.   Source: http://rockets.clutchfans.net/7680/rockets-honored-dwight-howard-agent-agreement-chandler-parsons-contract/  2) There were other tweets via Michael Eaves (though I understand if you choose not to believe that).  I'm saying, the fact that their relationship is even coming into question somewhat consistently with his major clients is why there may be some backing to Cuban/Fegan doing shady things.  Now against Parsons?  This one is a bit different, but it is more in regards to tampering.  Let me start off by saying, tampering can technically be done by a player as he is a part of the organization, so recruiting a player before free agency begins (whether you are the coach, GM, or even a player) is tampering.  The only reason the players seem unaffected by this is because it would be unrealistic to regulate. So many of these guys are friends, it's impossible to tell if their dinners have to do with recruiting each other (which let's face it, they probably do).  However, the MAJOR difference between Chandler Parsons doing it was that he essentially TOLD everyone what he did (source was Tim/Ramona's article).  I think it's pretty obvious Wade/LeBron/Bosh talked about teaming up before hand, the only difference is that they didn't go to ESPN and tell everyone what they did.  If you were to ask them, they would absolutely deny it.  Chandler Parsons on the other hand was basically bragging about what a good job he did and how he liked these GM type activities."
nba,3e13fe,InTheMorning_Nightss,-24,Tue Jul 21 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to tell you.  If you don't get why Fegan wanted DeAndre in Dallas, you don't understand the basic economics of the opportunity DeAndre passed up to stay in LA.  Further, this mythic Fegan/Cuban relationship, how has it really benefited the Mavs?  What major A-list client has he truly brought?  Parsons?  I got news for you...Parsons wanted Dallas as much as Dallas wanted him.  He was already getting buddy buddy with Dirk and Cubes the summer before he left Houston.    Further, if you don't get why Doc crossed an unspoken professional line if he did in fact encourage DeAndre to mislead a competitor that he made a verbal agreement with (which while not legally binding is generally viewed as binding by everyone else around the league during the moratorium), I guess I would suggest you don't understand the difference between how a coach is supposed to act and how a gm/team executive is expected to act.  It's how you turn a player changing his mind to make a decision that fully benefits you to a possible reason for another party to sue you for encouraging a player to falsely mislead another team while that player is gaining insider info to that team's offseason plans."
nba,3e13fe,chaplinatemyshoe,28,Tue Jul 21 04:39:27 2015 UTC,"Further, this mythic Fegan/Cuban relationship, how has it really benefited the Mavs? What major A-list client has he truly brought? Parsons? I got news for you...Parsons wanted Dallas as much as Dallas wanted him. He was already getting buddy buddy with Dirk and Cubes the summer before he left Houston.   Fegan has been a long time friend of Cubans and tried to bring Dwight Howard to Dallas just a year ago, when Dwight decided to stay in Houston Fegan made some demands for the Rockets FO, one including Chandler Parsons (another client of his) be released, and look where he ended up, in the last year Fegan has attempted to bring 3 of his biggest clients to Dallas. When the Deandre situation happened there were plenty of stories claiming Fegan was attempting to make up Dallas missing out on Dwight by bringing them Deandre.  I won't even get into the ""gaining insider info"" or discussions of Doc Rivers gentlemanliness because it's so goddamn stupid"
nba,3e13fe,hazzajames,0,Tue Jul 21 04:53:13 2015 UTC,"Clearly it's not because the Mavs were consistently one of the few non-tanking teams with max cap space to go after marquee free agents. It's because there's just some underhanded relationship between Cuban and Fegan.  Also, ""plenty of stories""? You mean the series of tweets by Eaves which Stein refuted?"
nba,3e13fe,gigantism,-2,Tue Jul 21 07:40:03 2015 UTC,"What I gathered from this is that Boogie to the Lakers was all a ruse, Fegan is going to try to push him to the Mavs!"
nba,3e13fe,InTheMorning_Nightss,13,Tue Jul 21 05:28:39 2015 UTC,"I love how you essentially condone Fegan's possible shady actions, but then continue to criticize us and Doc for something that is nothing more than a completely unsupported theory that YOU made up.  You can guarantee whatever you want, doesn't mean it has ANY validity to it.  Even if you believe otherwise, I feel it VERY unlikely that Doc was telling DJ to actively lie to Cuban or anything.  That is more of a stretch than any of the theories regarding Fegan/Cuban, and you are already acting as if it is 100% true, when there is literally NOTHING to even remotely support that.  On a related note, Doc is NOT the GM as much as people believe.   If you don't get why Fegan wanted DeAndre in Dallas, you don't understand the basic economics of the opportunity DeAndre passed up to stay in LA.   Wait, what?  Sure, DeAndre had more room to grow in Dallas, but the fact is, he already is a max contract player so raising his value obviously wasn't the priority, especially considering he opted to take the non-max deal.  If raising his value for monetary reasons was the plan, he would have even taken a shorter deal, because he would almost certainly get that 20 million next year as well, and if he did pan out to be a franchise center, he would have gotten much more.  If by ""basic economics"" you mean more publicity, you are just wrong.  The LA market is more prominent than that of Dallas.  For example, if Parsons was on the Lakers, I'm pretty sure we would see his face far more than we do now.  Don't patronize someone else by saying ""you don't understand basic economics"" and then not back it up.   What major A-list client has he truly brought?   Even if he didn't succeed, that doesn't mean he didn't influence and impact the decision process more than he should have.  There is an article talking about how Fegan had some demands for if Dwight did go to Houston.  The thing is, I don't know if all of these are true, but the fact that people are questioning this relationship to begin with is enough for it to be a concern."
nba,3e13fe,InTheMorning_Nightss,3,Tue Jul 21 05:11:01 2015 UTC,Except DJ did initially prefer the shorter deal with the Mavs before he reneged. 4 years instead of the 5 the Clippers initially offered. There's a reason why ultimately he signed with the Clippers for essentially the same contract the Mavs would have given him.
nba,3e13fe,gigantism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:43:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but again, if raising your value for monetary reasons is what his MAIN goal was, he absolutely could have gotten any contract he wanted, in which case 4 years probably isn't the best route to go, especially with the cap rising a ton.  I understand this may not be that significant, but if you are trying to argue with me that ""I don't understand basic economics of the opportunity DeAndre passed up to stay in LA,"" then I'm not going to bite."

nba,3e13fe,longb123,8,Tue Jul 21 13:50:43 2015 UTC,"No.  It is the agent's job to do what his client tells him to do within the rules of the league, period, and it is DJ's job to tell his agent what he wants him to do.  If DJ told his agent to call Cuban and his agent didn't, that is on the agent.  However, if DJ didn't tell him to call Cuban or, even worse, specifically told him not to call Cuban, that is 100% on DJ because he is the one in charge.  Otherwise, you are basically saying it is the agent's job to inform owners about the private conversations they've had with the client without the client's permission to do so.    That is shit that will get you decertified.  Acting like it is the agent's job is just cover up bullshit unless DJ specifically told him to do it and the agent refused.  I may have missed it, but I'm pretty sure that I didn't see any reports that it happened that way."

nba,3e13fe,MJGSimple,18,Tue Jul 21 15:42:43 2015 UTC,"I've got a ""fairness"" question about this whole moratorium period thing.  After talking with Jordan, the Mavs played the rest of their immediate free agency with the thought that they had Jordan as their center. Other centers they could have gotten came and went. When Jordan pulled out, the Mavs were left high and dry. Jordan plays for the clippers. His actions actively hurt a direct competitor to the Clippers in the west. I.e. increased their chances of winning, not just because he signed with them, but because he prevented another playoff team in the west from adding to its roster with players other than Jordan.  I'm not saying that this was his intention (because it clearly wasn't), however, does this set a precedent for something like this happening in the future? What if some team intentionally tells a player to pretend to sign with another team, with no intention of doing so. When the player pulls out at the last minute, he can screw them over. You could actively target close competitors with this style.  ""Hey Spurs, Tony Parker is retiring and you need a point guard? Oh look, Steph Curry is looking to sign with you, wow he did! Whoops, just kidding, back to the warriors, sorry you missed out on those other guys.""  Maybe I'm being too cynical and no team has that level of Machiavellian strategy, but the possibility is there and I feel like teams should in some way be protected? ""That's the risk you take with verbal agreements"" is what people might say in response, except this isn't exactly honor crazed Ancient Greece here, and the Mavs couldnt get verbal agreements from like 4 centers and then dump 3 when a contract was actually signed. Nor could they sit out of the verbal agreement period while other teams went for Centers."
nba,3e13fe,Zeabos,5,Tue Jul 21 04:49:47 2015 UTC,"For a second, the attention felt good, but after you think about everything and get out all the glitz and glamour from the process   I don't think this how most guys go into the free agency process.

nba,3e13fe,sterninator39,19,Tue Jul 21 03:52:29 2015 UTC,DeAndre is still a bitch.
nba,3e13fe,AnalSlutFrog,7,Tue Jul 21 05:39:25 2015 UTC,"DJ is still a fuccboi.  Having read it, what the hell was the point of this? I scrolled down expected to see a few more paragraphs but there was nothing.  What a joke."

nba,3e13fe,drcash360-2ndaccount,9,Tue Jul 21 04:49:05 2015 UTC,"MJ, kobe"
nba,3e13fe,csquared34,7,Tue Jul 21 05:08:44 2015 UTC,"That's totally why MJ was 100% PR friendly with stuff such as ""Republicans buy shoes too"" his entire career or Kobe tried to do the exact same thing before his rape allegation."
nba,3e13fe,Number333,4,Tue Jul 21 06:36:08 2015 UTC,"Even after the scandal, Kobe had commercials in which he said things like ""hate me because I'm a champion."" No disrespect to him for that, but all players want to be liked and respected deep down."
nba,3e13fe,waitingonthatbuffalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:24:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I fully believe Kobe dgaf, all he cares about is winning.  He could be doing so much more if he cared about what people think.  Everything he's done seems like he's done it on his terms."
nba,3e13fe,blabla2416,15,Tue Jul 21 13:45:29 2015 UTC,"This is the first article I've read that turned me off to The Players' Tribune.  Again, it's all about the drama behind DeAndre--we're gonna shoot an artsy little interview, etc., it'll be known as The Apology.  But I don't think he ever said sorry and he never manned up and confronted the real mistakes that were made.  Blake's article, however, was amazing."
nba,3e13fe,whoburntmytoast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:16:32 2015 UTC,"Blake's article was funny and only made him more likeable, but he really didn't clear much up. There was a lot of deflection."
nba,3e13fe,whythehellknot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:17:31 2015 UTC,Blake's a red herring and a good one ever since whole the fiasco started but dj immaturity is so big it overshadows it.
nba,3e13fe,LoneScum,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:59 2015 UTC,deandre jordan posts a press release weeks after anyone stopped caring
nba,3e13fe,Oliver_Stacks,3,Tue Jul 21 12:44:48 2015 UTC,"The only thing ""new"" from this is that he apparently felt bad turning down the Mavs after committing and it apparently got to him a lot. It got to him so much that he didn't feel like allowing them to talk to him or even letting them know about his decision."
nba,3e13fe,Doub1eVision,13,Tue Jul 21 15:48:16 2015 UTC,The vagina hat isn't a good look.
nba,3e13fe,SonOfSkipBaeless,18,Tue Jul 21 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"Doesn't even mention anything about how he screwed the Mavs at the last second, though."
nba,3e13fe,adomanski,6,Tue Jul 21 03:47:32 2015 UTC,"So what I'm going to gather from this is that he was too much of a people pleaser to be able to tell Cuban, Parsons and the Mavs that he changed his mind, face to face or even on the phone. Which makes him seem, quite immature."
nba,3e13fe,e_muny,7,Tue Jul 21 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"This mother fucker STILL hasn't called Cuban.  But he's ""written"" an article and shot a video explaining everything.  Haha."

nba,3e13fe,Scabandiri,9,Tue Jul 21 05:31:15 2015 UTC,"It's easy to forget that he's been there since Blake and CP3, but he's one of the cornerstones of the Clippers.

nba,3e13fe,BrianDawkins,-9,Tue Jul 21 03:47:48 2015 UTC,It's not his job to keep the Mavs intact
nba,3e13fe,drcash360-2ndaccount,16,Tue Jul 21 04:48:44 2015 UTC,It's his job to be a professional. Which he isn't.
nba,3e13fe,WillyTanner,7,Tue Jul 21 06:01:03 2015 UTC,It should be his job to make informed decisions. This was a huge career move that he clearly just made on a whim and then backtracked. It should be his job to carry out commitments. Especially at this level.
nba,3e13fe,whythehellknot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:08:27 2015 UTC,dumb post that is deserving of the downvotes to oblivion it's getting.
nba,3e13fe,chexmixho,-9,Tue Jul 21 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"This lone move fucked the mavs? what about trading the whole bench for rondo, what about isolating tyson before deandre committed."
nba,3e13fe,CrayolaMelt,4,Tue Jul 21 06:08:21 2015 UTC,"if the mavs would have got him, they would have had their cornerstones of the team for the next few years with parsons,matthews and jordan. around that core would be veterans like nowitzki,williams,harris,barea. now they are stuck with zaza pachulia to defend against the big men in the west. the moves you are talking about werent great, but that didnt fuck them. maybe their bench would have been better if they still had crowder, but what really fucked them is deandre jordans verbal commitment, which also prevented them from getting other available centers."
nba,3e13fe,dermsen,3,Tue Jul 21 08:48:52 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say this guy is never getting respect from most people ever again

nba,3e1h7v,Sawgon,4,Tue Jul 21 16:25:59 2015 UTC,"Babylonians and Assyrians aren't mutually exclusive. I'm Assyrian. We still exist, even though we don't have a country."
nba,3e1h7v,whodeeya,-5,Tue Jul 21 16:43:03 2015 UTC,Assyria existed so long ago that it's impossible to know whether you are of Assyrian descent. It's like saying a French guy is a Gaul because France exists where ancient Gaul existed. There is no logical reason to consider yourself Assyrian as opposed to Babylonian or Sumerian.
nba,3e1h7v,ironykarl,7,Tue Jul 21 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"There is no logical reason to consider yourself Assyrian as opposed to Babylonian or Sumerian.   Except that Assyrians are a recognized ethic group and not just members of an ancient empire. Come on, dude!"
nba,3e1h7v,whodeeya,0,Tue Jul 21 17:20:59 2015 UTC,"After a quick Google search, it looks like you are correct. I still think calling a modern person Assyrian is bound to be historically inaccurate, but ethnic divisions don't necessarily follow any logic. I, for example, am 'American,' which conveys practically nothing of ethnic significance."
nba,3e1h7v,Sawgon,3,Tue Jul 21 17:34:01 2015 UTC,Lmao. Are you trying to correct my own race? I speak the language and I'm named after several Assyrian kings.

nba,3e1h7v,silasioalejandro,3,Tue Jul 21 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure I buy that. IIRC Armenia is very close to both Iraq and Iran, which are typically seen as ""middle eastern"" in most places outside of the region. I know multiple people of Armenian descent, and they do not appear ethnically Caucasian.  Do you have any more info on that? genuinely curious"

nba,3e1h7v,ulyssessgrant93,6,Tue Jul 21 14:14:26 2015 UTC,Gasol would not start on the all time Laker team. Any combination of Shaq/Wilt/Kareem would be the two bigs.

nba,3e317o,Extremeaty,19,Tue Jul 21 15:59:01 2015 UTC,"Will   Hezonja gives them the shooting they desparately needed. Frye will need to bounce back and do that as well.  Oladipo is on the verge of a Butleresque breakout Payton, Dipo and Gordon will form one of the league's most athletic defenses, and make up for the shortcomings at the 5.  Harris will make strides defensively and look to shoot less given his new contract.  Most importantly, Gordon looks much stronger in Summer League and was physically dominant. He should be able to play the 4 a lot and provide acceptable spacing while absolutely punishing slower bigs off the dribble, and give nothing up on the other end.    Won't   Way too young.  Still not enough shooting.  Oladipo probably won't actually make that leap for another year or so."
nba,3e317o,humanhighlightreel,6,Tue Jul 21 16:05:05 2015 UTC,The age core of this team is around the same age if not older than the 2010-2011 OKC WCF team. Crazy how amazing and young that team was

nba,3e317o,GeezManNo,7,Tue Jul 21 18:43:48 2015 UTC,Will  Their offense is constantly growing  Oladipo/Vucevic/Tobias are all stars  Henzonja is a definite plus  Payton/Gordon are getting much better at understanding the game  Won't  Very very unexperienced team  Defense efficiency is pretty bad  One of the highest turn over rates in the league  Need a stronger backup player at the C position  Edit: Backup C
nba,3e317o,Siddc3,6,Tue Jul 21 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Their defense to close out the season, with the new coach, (I thought) was light years light years better.   If I'm wrong just slap me in the face."
nba,3e317o,ProbablyMyLastLogin,4,Tue Jul 21 16:08:07 2015 UTC,We went like 10 games in a row without giving up 100 points but as soon as we did our defense broke down again. Not as bad as how it did with Vaughn but still bad. We were like a top 7 defensive team in Borrego's first 10 games he coached lol

nba,3e317o,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:00 2015 UTC,Vucevic to LA confirmed. Thanks buddy.
nba,3e317o,Siddc3,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:53 2015 UTC,Will:  We have a real coach.  Oladipo will continue to improve and be a legitimate all star candidate.  Offense will improve with Hezonja.  Gordon looked incredible in summer league.  Wont:  Still too young.  No rim protection.
nba,3e317o,whtge8,4,Tue Jul 21 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"WILL -   Spacing nightmare is solved by improved shooting from Tobias Harris, Oladipo, Gordon, and Payton coupled with the addition of a ROY caliber year from Hezonja, the rebirth of Frye, and the unleashing of Vucevic from the 3 point line. Defensive improvement explodes under Scott Skiles resulting in a hyperactive, long, disciplined defense that can switch 1-4 and defend for 90 ft.  The versatility of the roster allows the Magic to match up with wide range of playoff teams while creating mismatches at the other end.  The Magic have a deep young team with limited injury histories and could emerge as one of the healthiest teams at the end of the year.    WON'T   The amount of shooting improvement needed to really fix the spacing issues is pretty unlikely to happen in one offseason. Tons of work to be done in tightening up the defensive scheme before it can take advantage of the physical skills of the team. Very young team without a superstar who can bail them out. Very prone to collapses and mental lapses.  Zero rim protection without Dedmon in the game. Spacing nightmare reaches comical levels with Dedmon in the game.    Overall: This will be a very transitional year. If things break right the Magic could sniff the playoffs, but if a few things go poorly we could very easily be back in the lottery."
nba,3e317o,IOnlyCareAboutIrony,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"Although they've got some serious young talent that will be absolutely entertaining to watch (Payton, Gordan, Oladipo, Hezonja, etc.) they're far too young, don't have the stellar veteran leaders required and are almost at the end of their rebuild. Likely one more rebuilding season from becoming a playoff team (or at least really attempting to challenge for a playoff birth). A team of the future."
nba,3e317o,Steamified,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:49 2015 UTC,Will=they have every position covered. Orlando had a strong starting five and some nice pieces of the bench. Dipo and Payton will be an interesting backcourt that'll cause offensive problems for tons of other teams. Vucevic will be an all star. Hezonja can now space the floor. And Gordon if healthy is a great young defensive power forward.   Won't=they need more time to gel and build chemistry. Still too young and they don't have a reliable offensive system yet.

nba,3e317o,sockmulletco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:40 2015 UTC,"Will. One of the most talented rosters I have ever seen. Their biggest flaw last year was sometimes lacking reliable shooting outside of Vucy (and Tobias when he wasn't hurt). I think that issue may be solved with Mario, etc. Their defense picked up enormously under the new coach. And the only thing they still might lack is adequate rim protection.  Won't. Simply too young of a team. Even if they break into the playoffs it would be for a first round exit to a more experienced team."

nba,3e2md0,jamesmunger,9,Tue Jul 21 15:29:37 2015 UTC,"That was before LMA forced Popovich to commit to 5 more years, though."
nba,3e2md0,heat_forever,4,Tue Jul 21 15:44:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised to see him grab a high profile job the next time there's a spot free."
nba,3e2md0,VanGundysBaldHead,3,Tue Jul 21 17:36:06 2015 UTC,Pop would be the first to tell him to go take the job.
nba,3e2md0,greg9683,2,Tue Jul 21 18:53:03 2015 UTC,In an interview Pop said that when he signe.. he promised his players that he would finish his contract. Take it for what its worth. And im too lazy to find the source.
nba,3e2md0,o0adam0o,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:04 2015 UTC,It's in the Marc Stein interview with LMA.
nba,3e2md0,greg9683,7,Tue Jul 21 18:52:43 2015 UTC,Dude was best coach in Europe. Better than Blatt. Blatt wasn't even 2nd best
nba,3e2md0,Houston_sucks,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"Things changed when Pop decided to play out his contract because of LMA. I'm sure Pop is telling Messina, jump on the first offer he can because he's not that young."
nba,3e2md0,greg9683,6,Tue Jul 21 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"no. pop will coach out his contract, Ettore is no young gun, he's only 10 years younger, he will find a job elsewhere."
nba,3e2md0,comicbooksven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking. If Ettore leaves before Pop does, then Becky may definitely replace him."
nba,3e2md0,dragonbutterfly89,17,Tue Jul 21 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be sooner than some think. Coaching turnover is high enough in the NBA that there will be no shortage of opportunities. While she may very well deserve a shot based on her coaching ability alone, you also can't ignore the fact that hiring her would bring positive PR and more exposure (especially for a bottom of the barrel type team)."
nba,3e2md0,gordontrue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:27 2015 UTC,"You know, unless it backfires and people around the team say shit they shouldn't. Or she's a bad coach and the players don't respond to her, then they look like misogynists."
nba,3e2md0,jefecaminador1,8,Tue Jul 21 19:00:13 2015 UTC,what if they're grooming her to be Pops replacement years down the line?
nba,3e2md0,they_want_my_soul,37,Tue Jul 21 14:09:58 2015 UTC,I think Messina is ahead of her atm
nba,3e2md0,viscaelbarca1899,7,Tue Jul 21 14:11:35 2015 UTC,Messina could easily get a HC gig now if there was one available.
nba,3e2md0,BizGilwalker,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"True. Considering how many franchises are hiring rookie coaches lately, I'm surprised no-one has offered Messina a position."
nba,3e2md0,viscaelbarca1899,6,Tue Jul 21 14:28:19 2015 UTC,They have. Messina probably just said no.
nba,3e2md0,athos45678,6,Tue Jul 21 14:57:06 2015 UTC,"Well, in that case, that could indicate Pop will retire soon. However, earlier this summer, I saw rumours about him staying for another 4-5 years after landing LMA."
nba,3e2md0,viscaelbarca1899,4,Tue Jul 21 15:00:26 2015 UTC,Maybe there is some secret deal. In PATFO i trust
nba,3e2md0,athos45678,15,Tue Jul 21 15:03:46 2015 UTC,Messina. Becky isn't even a front-seat assistant yet.
nba,3e2md0,Buick6,3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"I was thinking perhaps Messina would be ready to roll before Pop wanted to retire, but you'd know better than I would I guess"
nba,3e2md0,they_want_my_soul,0,Tue Jul 21 14:27:15 2015 UTC,She will be this year
nba,3e2md0,KuyaJohnny,6,Tue Jul 21 14:21:19 2015 UTC,"That would be disrespectful to Udoka/Marks. BH is awesome and has done a great job, but she has been with Spurs only one year. Lets slow down the carriage and be realistic."
nba,3e2md0,andres7832,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:14 2015 UTC,Whats there to slow down? She will sit in the first row this year
nba,3e2md0,KuyaJohnny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:44 2015 UTC,"She has a chance now that Boylan left. Marks is back in the front office, like he's supposed to be."
nba,3e2md0,greg9683,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"Marks went back up to the front office last year. He was only a coach because they lost so many coaches. They have ""big plans for him"" in the front office, it was said when they talked about it.   Boylan left, but yes, Udoka is definitely one of the lead assistants (big man coach)."
nba,3e2md0,greg9683,9,Tue Jul 21 18:54:21 2015 UTC,"This thread is madness. Ignoring gender for a second, there are tons of people who are assistants for years and never make it at to the HC spot.  Thibs got his first Assistant coach job in 1989 and didn't get a HC job until 2011.  He broke off a wedding and committed his life to basketball and is a top 3 coach in the league and it took him 22 years to make that leap.  Additionally, there are 2 aspects to coaching. Xs and Os are one thing, and locker room control/chemistry/ego management is another. Guys like Fisher get hired almost entirely for the latter. Hammon has displayed good Xs and Os ability on a very limited basis, and has almost zero experience in charge of an NBA locker room. It's not going to happen in the next ten years at least."
nba,3e2md0,greg25,3,Tue Jul 21 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"Top 3 coach in the league? Debatable, for sure."
nba,3e2md0,grubberlang,3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting, who would you put above him besides Popp and Carlisle? I guess i rule out guys like Kerr, Blatt, Stevens, etc who only have a year or two, I don't think that's a fair sample size. Spoelstra is up there but I'd like to see him make the playoffs without LBJ before calling him top 5."
nba,3e2md0,greg25,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know - for me it's also about how he's perceived by front offices around the league. Don't get me wrong - he's obviously very good. But if it were a consensus that he's a top 3 talent, I think he'd already be in a new job."
nba,3e2md0,grubberlang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think he hasn't been hired because of talent. I think if he wanted a job, Minnesota, NO, ORL, and probably some teams that already have coaches allw ould have been on the phone in a heartbeat. I think he is waiting out on purpose for the Lakers job next summer, but that's just my theory."
nba,3e2md0,greg25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:03 2015 UTC,She has two years of experience with an NBA locker room tbh. That's not nothing. Not even close to zero.
nba,3e2md0,Anachronym,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:14 2015 UTC,"Fair, but I guess I meant she has zero experience managing one. I'll update my post to say that."
nba,3e2md0,greg25,3,Tue Jul 21 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"I hope (and think) she stays with us. Let her a couple more years under pop, maybe some time under Messina if he sticks around that Long and then make her the SA coach."
nba,3e2md0,KuyaJohnny,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:51 2015 UTC,Maybe she's Popovich's replacement in 5 years?
nba,3e2md0,BizGilwalker,3,Tue Jul 21 14:25:07 2015 UTC,She's only 38. Most guys don't get chances until they're in their fifties. The ones that get one before them had nba playing experience.
nba,3e2md0,mathpoet,0,Tue Jul 21 16:53:07 2015 UTC,There are exceptions though.  Brad Stevens and Lawrence Frank come to mind for example.
nba,3e2md0,skiptomylou1231,4,Tue Jul 21 17:55:53 2015 UTC,Probably never.
nba,3e2md0,Thetealsnake,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:03 2015 UTC,Bobby Marks just gave his input
nba,3e2md0,gordontrue,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"Her biggest hurdle will be proving that she won't get David Blatted by star players in the huddle during the playoffs.   These situations already don't go too well:  Run the pick and roll Dwight  Pass the ball Kobe  That's not a high percentage shot JR  Quit complaining and get back on defense WoW, 3, Flash?"
nba,3e2md0,dichloroethane,5,Tue Jul 21 16:16:17 2015 UTC,"someone watched SC this morning lol  did anyone else find the commentary from SC on BH a little ham-fisted? they said something like, ""one day we won't think of becky Hammond as a great female coach, but just as a great coach...."""
nba,3e2md0,GeauxHouston22,5,Tue Jul 21 14:29:25 2015 UTC,One of the Summer League announcers mentioned that Hammon couldn't wait for the drama to be over so that there's not so much focus on her gender. Then the announcing crew spends 5 minutes talking about how great it is that a female coach is being given a chance.
nba,3e2md0,nh0815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:32 2015 UTC,it's just the media trying to sell the story.
nba,3e2md0,Pyundai,3,Tue Jul 21 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"Never, NBA players barely respond to coaches without a ring or who didn't play in the NBA like they did. They would never respond to a female coach."
nba,3e2md0,heat_forever,2,Tue Jul 21 15:43:33 2015 UTC,One of the dumber things I've ever read. Clearly NBA players have already responded well to her.
nba,3e2md0,Anachronym,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:56 2015 UTC,Not as a head coach genius. It's not the same thing. At all.
nba,3e2md0,01258974563,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:34 2015 UTC,the fuck? She's been a low-level assistant for like two years. She still has miles to go before even being considered for a head coaching spot.

nba,3e2md0,nBdyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:03 2015 UTC,i always thought she was gonna to be pop replacement when he retires with the big3.
nba,3e2md0,LoneScum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:46:58 2015 UTC,There's no guarantee she'll ever be given that chance.  Just because she was the first female assistant coach doesn't mean she's going to be the first female head coach.
nba,3e2md0,villa4real,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"She will get a head-coaching job in the WNBA or College before she gets one in the NBA. Not trying to demean her or her success or achievements, but it's the truth."
nba,3e2md0,_EDM_,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:55 2015 UTC,"""truth""."
nba,3e2md0,phob0phile,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"I think she deserves to be a head coach today, but I think it'll be a while before someone takes a chance on her."
nba,3e2md0,dicky_________seamus,9,Tue Jul 21 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"She's been an assistant coach for exactly one year.  It's unlikely anyone is ready for the gig after a single year -- even when learning from the best -- and that's just fine.  That said, I'm curious what the average/median assistant tenure is before landing a HC job."
nba,3e2md0,brystmar,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. I never said she was ready, but the standard for NBA coaches is set. Guys like Jason Kidd and Derek Fisher have head coaching gigs with zero prior coaching experience.   Hammon is a former player, too (the fundamentals of the game don't change league to league) now with a year of experience.  Is she ready? Probably not. Does her resume stack up against current head coaches? In my opinion, yes."
nba,3e2md0,dicky_________seamus,0,Tue Jul 21 15:29:17 2015 UTC,"Guys like Kidd and Fisher were NBA players who played for NBA coaches for their entire careers. That's experience. In Kidd's case, he was probably acting as an assistant coach on the court already.  College and women's basketball experience has nearly zero relevance to NBA coaching."
nba,3e2md0,heat_forever,0,Tue Jul 21 15:47:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, if college basketball has nearly zero relevance to NBA Coaching, explain Billy Donovan. Prime example of how playing under a good head coach for your pro career doesn't always translate to being a good coach yourself: Brian Shaw.  Hell, the only decent coach Jason Kidd had was Rick Carlisle   You can have different cuts of steak, but at the end of the day, it's all beef."

nba,3e2md0,dicky_________seamus,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"Billy Donovan has zero wins in the NBA, what's your point again?"
nba,3e2md0,heat_forever,3,Tue Jul 21 17:26:03 2015 UTC,Billy Donovan is an NBA Head Coach. So what makes him any different from any other college or women's coach? He was obviously good enough to hire to an NBA team.
nba,3e2md0,dicky_________seamus,14,Tue Jul 21 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"What makes you think that she deserves to be a head coach today? Sure, she could pan out as we've seen other relatively inexperienced coaches do recently, but what specifically have you seen that makes you think she could be a head coach right now?"
nba,3e2md0,VanGundysBaldHead,4,Tue Jul 21 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"She was an assistant on the Spurs team last season, she just won the Summer League Chip as coach. If you watched the Spurs games, you probably noticed that her decisions and adjustments played a big part in that. For example, when the defense had troubles with the Nets' screens, she told the players to switch the way they were playing the screens, and the Nets went scoreless for several minutes. She also moved Kyle Anderson from Small Forward to Power Forward, which turned out to be beneficial for him as he won the Summer League MVP. Another thing I've noticed is how she actually takes the time to properly draw plays. ""The Guardian"" summed it up pretty good   Most coaches do not take care to properly diagram a play. This might seem like a simple thing but it’s a problem that few in the profession care to confront. They call a timeout, pull the team in a huddle and slash some lines with a pen across the small dry erase boards they clutch in their hands. The players nod their head as the coaches yell, look at the graffiti of scribbles on the board and start asking questions: “What do I do here?” “Now where do I throw the ball?”  Hammon’s lines are straight. They are neat. They don’t zig and zag and head off the edge of the board into an abyss. When someone is supposed to run to the right, she draws a thick line going to the right. When someone is supposed to throw a pass, she adds a dotted line between the two X’s.  Nobody asks what they are supposed to do.  Nobody asks where they throw the ball."
nba,3e2md0,NotByAnyMeans,-6,Tue Jul 21 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"If Derek Fisher is a head coach, Becky Hammon is AT LEAST as good.  They're both former players who received their tutelage from some of the all time greats."
nba,3e2md0,dicky_________seamus,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:36 2015 UTC,Yeah but Derek Fisher actually played in the league.
nba,3e2md0,GritznGravy23,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:06 2015 UTC,idk how many people I have to tell. WNBA ≠ NBA. Not even close.
nba,3e2md0,dmitch1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:45 2015 UTC,"Principles of the game are the same. Basketball is basketball. WNBA players can't compete at the same level as NBA players because of physical limitations, but it's ignorant to say it's not possible for people involved in the WNBA to be as knowledgeable about the sport as those involved in the NBA.  As she stands today, I wouldn't want her as my coach because she isn't experienced, but she's is as experienced as a handful of current HCs."
nba,3e2md0,dicky_________seamus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"Right, which makes sense as to why she'd be a great assistant coach because she understands the game.  However, a lot of what someone like Fisher/Kidd learn from their time in the NBA is how to manage players and teams. That is a huge, huge aspect of being a head coach. If you need convincing read Showtime by Jeff Pearlman to show how much a coach being able to control players and personalities matters.   Her time in the WNBA would give her absolutely zero experience with that in the NBA. The money/ego/lifestyle changes are enormous. If she wants to become a HC someday, hopefully Pop is letting her get a glimpse of that."
nba,3e2md0,Hoser117,0,Tue Jul 21 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"The game is played a lot differently though, and as the cavs flair guy said, hell will freeze over before NBA players let themselves be coached by her like that."
nba,3e2md0,dmitch1,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:51 2015 UTC,What you mean is that Hell will freeze over before you can accept her as a HC.
nba,3e2md0,CoogiDownToThaSocks,0,Tue Jul 21 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"Principles of the game are the same.   Principles of a middle school game are the same as a pro NBA game -- put the ball in the basket. But the WNBA is a different beast and is like moving from coaching a high school team to a college team. Better, more athletic players require a more complex coaching strategy in every facet of the game.  Source: coached high school boys and learned from a few college coaches. They were soooo much smarter than me in basketball that I knew I'd never have the talent to take it to the next level."

nba,3e2md0,CoogiDownToThaSocks,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason some of those long-time assistants don't get shots... is because the owners sometimes care more about making a splash than the credentials of the coach.   Hammon won't have that working against her... as hiring her would definitely make a splash.  Edit: oops, meant to reply to a different comment"
