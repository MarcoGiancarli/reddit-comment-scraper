StarWarsBattlefront,3e1c5j,LtRoyalShrimp,6,Tue Jul 21 08:40:12 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you.   The silly reason that they don't have space battles; Dice had argued that they toned it down from 64 to 40 players because they wanted a more focused fight and were afraid of splitting up the battle. If they have 64 players though you could technically have 32 on the ground and 32 in the sky and still more than the 20 total per team. 20v20 just seems very small for a battlefront game.  Dice doesn't make sense.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Koraik,22,Mon Jul 20 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like you should be able to get in the vehicle you want to get into, and take it somewhere, and get out where you want to. Rather than staying in one spot while you man something in a different place, and then going back to that one spot again when you decide to get out. Segregates the methods of gameplay, removes a lot of tactical/strategic depth, and for me ruins the immersion. I see no reason for them making that decision."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,budgie88,24,Tue Jul 21 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Well, criticizing the alpha is how it improves anyway. But, apart form this, the alpha (from what I've seen) seems like its a finished part of the game. It seems like the new demos for games is an ""alpha"" or ""beta"". Similar Destiny, Rainbow 6 siege and Battlefield Hardline all having a beta/alpha, anyone who played those (especially Destinys beta) knows they weren't a beta/alpha they was just a part of the game that was considered finished and something they didn't necessarily intended to change so they could show it off and be immune to criticism. Again though, criticising it can get it changed if its not good or working just like how Hardline was changed after the uproar about its ""beta"". It is the actual game, its just not finished, so now is the best time to talk about any small or big issues you have with the game."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,maroonbiologist,36,Mon Jul 20 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"DICE is pretty well known for the alpha version of their games being damn near identical to their actual released product.  See Battlefield 3, 4, etc."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Fenixfrost,5,Mon Jul 20 18:54:54 2015 UTC,They left a lot out of their alphas content wise actually. BF3 alpha was just rush on Operation Metro while the BF4 alpha was just the domination game mode on Siege of Shanghai.

No not much changed, but there were at least 9 maps not included, game modes, balance changes, and weapons. Stuff like gameplay doesn't change from alpha/betas to release, but there are usually balance changes. So you can't say a lot didn't change."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Koraik,5,Mon Jul 20 22:24:53 2015 UTC,"Looking back IIRC the only major changes to BF3 alpha was that the UMP was nerfed.  For BF4 there were actually some major changes from alpha to beta. Alpha had 30hz servers, lock on RPGs (just wow) and the dmg model was 20 max dmg for assault rifles.   So yes I was wrong, there were some changes but the BF4 changes minus the RPG were just downgrades.   The core gameplay of both games didn't change from alpha to release though."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,SaucyDancer_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:00:35 2015 UTC,yes. Also every launch has ended up killing the EA login servers for many many days until people give up trying to login.  EA simply dont expect that many users to be logged in the same time and knows the problem will go away when they stop trying to login. This was not a problem before EA bought DICE since everyone could host their own server before they made sure to close and shut down the large BF communities and modding.  I'm sure DICE will release the game no matter what bugs still are left there.   Specially if its some just instability like game crashes and things like that.   Everything else will be on the DLC extra.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,onico,5,Tue Jul 21 13:39:22 2015 UTC,People expecting the final game to be dramatically different are in for a rude shock I suspect. I saw it in Titanfall and I'm seeing it here. I'd love to be wrong but the systems we've seen just don't make for a game with legs and assuming they're just hiding all the depth is setting oneself up for big disappointment
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Hayt89,35,Tue Jul 21 01:42:10 2015 UTC,"It may not be the full game, but it's close enough that you should be able to judge the core game just on that. Yes, obviously some aspects can't be judged at this point, but if you think the gameplay now is super awesome, or super shitty, then your opinion isn't going to change with the few minor changes they might make between alpha and release."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Thotaz,-7,Mon Jul 20 16:27:52 2015 UTC,Exactly. They're not going to add a shit ton more of things Gameplay wise.   The alpha was massively disappointing imo

And to my knowledge they haven't said anything about any other game modes (but I do think there will be more)   But Walker assault map was way to big and bland for 20v20 infantry.   In rush (battlefield 3 and 4) the map was just the right size plus the environment is interactive. And not to mention more than just 20v20.

Also, on the main site for the game they state a variety will be there.    But Walker assault map was way to big and bland for 20v20 infantry.    I wasn't in the alpha so I can't confirm but those who did AMA's talked about how there is always action going on in the game, even with only 40 players."

This is a DICE game and unless they've just recently decided to switch up their pattern, this is pretty much what we'll be getting in October.   It's not even a real Alpha. A game in alpha status during development means it's constantly having new things added to its core, and a beta is mainly for refining/tweaking already added features and fixing all the game breaking bugs. That's all we're going to see aside from the rest of the game (maps, weapons etc) in October.  They're not adding new big features to the game, they're not adding new models, textures, or assets to the game. It's a glorified demo, but a beta at the least.   Stop screaming ""it's an alpha stop complaining"". Where the fuck have you been the last 5 years in gaming world?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Scaredycrow,4,Tue Jul 21 03:59:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with above and the OP.  DayZ Alpha is a good example of a true Alpha. A feed of constant news on what's being added week in, week out.  The fact the Alpha is missing loads of the features they're telling us about makes me think ""How is this a bug catching alpha when half the stuff they're claiming is in the game isn't in there."" Who's testing those bits?  But I guess there's a difference in Alpha between a relatively indie game (like DayZ) and a huge production (like Battlefront)."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,bugzkilla,17,Tue Jul 21 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"Your faith is admirable, but a little misplaced. The reason people take such stock in DICE's alphas is because, in past games, they have been really close to the final product. In all honesty, this maybe more of a beta than anything. ""But there will be a beta release before launch."" Yes, there will be, but this will be for stress tests on their servers for huge amounts of people playing rather than a test of gameplay. It will also be used as a ""demo"" of sorts to have one last push at selling games for pre order. That being said, there will be changes made, and hopefully if it doesn't feel right, they will push back the release date, but experience with prior games, this alpha will be pretty close to the final product with a little more flash and details."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Grishkob,-4,Mon Jul 20 17:05:41 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. Bullshit. And bullshit. Oh and bullshit. Having tested every DICE game since 2000, this is true only for BF4.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,animalhmother,-10,Tue Jul 21 10:00:23 2015 UTC,Everything we have seen so far seems really great.   20v20 isn't great or even good.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,procrastinating_ftw,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:18 2015 UTC,That doesn't really affect the quality of the gameplay though.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,jupiter78,-5,Mon Jul 20 19:47:27 2015 UTC,Yes it does!   Try playing battlefront 2 with only 20v20. Trying playing battlefield 3 or 4 with minimal or no vehicles (the alpha had no vehicles or if they did they were destroyed within a minute)  and only 20v20.   When I was a kid and played battlefront it was awesome to be immersed in a huge battle. 20v20 seems like a small misunderstanding let alone a war
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,procrastinating_ftw,0,Mon Jul 20 19:56:57 2015 UTC,I played bf3 on ps3 so the player count was limited to 12vs12. Still a great game

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Duffekc13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:34 2015 UTC,I completely agree!  For example Metro pulls it off fantastically and you are the only player. But there really wasn't any of those elements in the alpha imo

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Blackout2388,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:58 2015 UTC,it doesn't matter because the the alpha was bare bones in both.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,eric1_z,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"You really think they will change the time to kill, powerup system, movement pace, overheat system, the weird F2P-like ""card"" loadouts? I guess we'll see."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Hunter1207,2,Mon Jul 20 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"If the playtesters reported as such, and the community provided feedback, yes. That's the point of an Alpha and Beta."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,eric1_z,5,Mon Jul 20 19:09:53 2015 UTC,"In all the alphas and beta of FPS (Which is not that much, if I recall correctly I played Beta for Halo: Reach, Beta for Crysis 2, Alpha and Beta for Crysis 3, Alpha and Beta for Battlefield 3, Beta for Battlefield 4 and lastly alpha for Rainbow Six Siege, but I guess that one doesn't matter) I've played, there has never been a fundamental change in core cameplay at release compared to these earlier changes. In fact, all of those that I played were essentially identical in terms of core gameplay to their test versions. Interesting to see your take on this."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Hunter1207,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:19:39 2015 UTC,"I've been playing BF4 since it launched and they have not only changed and updated the game between Alpha and launch, but also post-launch. They JUST sent a patch this spring to better balance weapons and other stuff. I'm not here to say DICE is perfect, because they're not, but they sure as hell listen and they do try. They've changed player movement, balanced weapons, updated server settings for better hit registration, and fixed head glitching. You are completely wrong when you say they don't change core gameplay."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,jcrave,4,Mon Jul 20 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"I've played BF4 since launch too (not so much in the last few months since I've been wasting my life on busy with csgo and dota 2), and if you ask me, weapon balance is not core gameplay. Neither is slightly adjusted movement speed. A difference in core gameplay exists for example between BF4 and Red Ochestra 2, but not between BF4 and BF3 (or even Hardline)."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Hunter1207,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"Ok cool, weapon balance in a military FPS isn't core gameplay where BF3 was reticuled for over supression mechanics - OKAY?  I totally fucking disagree but that's your special opinion so we'll leave it at that."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,lowflyingmeat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:29:19 2015 UTC,"No, it is not core gameplay. The game still plays essentially the same, just with a different meta."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Hunter1207,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:30 2015 UTC,"Well if that's not core gameplay to you, then you're asking for a completely different game, and that's just not going to happen. You'd be asking them to develop an entirely new game in months and I honestly think that's ridiculous and enormously entitled."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,jcrave,3,Tue Jul 21 00:26:12 2015 UTC,"is it really entitled to want the best for your dream game? some people have waited more than 10 years for a new battlefront, its now coming to light this game isn't gonna cater to fans of the old game source~me aka U/The_Poolshark.   If you played PvZ: Garden Warfare and could get fun out of that, you will like Battlefront a lot.   also EA only has 7 years left of exclusivity on the star wars license, so lets hope they do have clone wars,whatever the new film is era stuff planned. to at least cater to more than one group of star wars fans."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,W00KIIE,4,Mon Jul 20 22:38:31 2015 UTC,"That should be the theory, but what EA and DICE usually do is use alpha/beta for AD instead of testing. So I wouldn't expect too much difference. Some good examples are bf3, bf4 and hardline. Beta was pretty much an ad campaign for all those games."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Niietz,4,Mon Jul 20 21:28:51 2015 UTC,Well they seem keen on sticking with 20v20 which is the worst decision if you're trying to make an immersed fps. And terrible for people who enjoyed battlefront   Edit : fixed autocorrect

StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Shitpoe_Sterr,5,Mon Jul 20 16:32:28 2015 UTC,I'm perfectly fine with just 15 or even 10. I find modern shooters to be a bit overwhelming when it comes to gun variants. I just don't want the variety to be TOO low.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,grahamcrackers75,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:14 2015 UTC,wouldn't the low amount of weapons that can be countered work just like the class system of the old games though? in which case why get rid of it if your just doing another variant of it?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,budgie88,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:01 2015 UTC,I agree. I like the strategy behind the pros and cons of a couple weapons and countering them. Rather than hundreds of weapons. More or less everyone just finds the best 4 weapons and abuses them anyway
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Unnamed_5oldier,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:31 2015 UTC,Hell yeah. My favourite game's dirty bomb and each class only gets three primaries to choose from - doesn't hurt it one bit
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Hutchythesmall,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:33 2015 UTC,Somebody went through some of the internal data on the alpha and found all of the weapons that they developed textures and such for. They're posted in this subreddit somewhere.

It was already confirmed by a dev that we'll have more weapons as we level up.  So when it comes to content, no one here can claim, as a fact, that this game is lacking it.  Battlefield 3 Beta? You mean, the beta where we could play only 1 map (Metro) and we couldn't even unlock 50% of the weapons? Now compare that to the full game (without the DLCs) = more weapons, more vehicles, more maps, and more modes. Same goes for this game."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,Echo693,0,Mon Jul 20 19:40:52 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone complaining about 20v20? It's obvious that the game modes and maps will be made around that player count, and for ""bland"" modes like Walker Assualt (which I actually thought was a ton of fun) they change something as small as the amount of players if it's that big of an issue.   OP is right, full game has not been released yet, more game modes and maps would probably be great, we just haven't seen or played them yet. This is Dice, and battlefield has had game modes with vehicles removed so we could get a game mode within battlefront with the vehicle cards and other powerups removed if we really want that ""casual random factor"" to go away."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dyhxf,ToBeReverenced,0,Tue Jul 21 01:05:28 2015 UTC,I'm sure Dice and EA will find ways to incorporate things that will ruin the game even more by making it both arcadey and a battlefield reskin therefore making it appeal to neither group of people who already don't like the game. /s

StarWarsBattlefront,3dz8mx,Unnamed_5oldier,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain the details to me?  You sign up and pay for EA access. Then when the download becomes available you do that obviously.  Then do you get a certain amount of actual game time, or real life time? How much does EA access cost? Do you need a Gold Membership?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dz8mx,Steelyuhas,3,Mon Jul 20 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"You get actual game time, usually it's 10 hours. EA Access is $5 a month or $30 for purchasing a full year ($2.50 a month). You also get 10% off all EA purchases (full games & any add on content), so if you're planning on getting the game on Xbox, it'll save you a dollar to purchase a month and get some early access and only pay $54 for the game.   Not sure if you have to have Gold to sub to EA Access, but obviously you'd need Gold to play Battlefront itself."

Whats stopping me from waiting until I see its on EA access, paying for one month, and then cancelling the sub? I get the early access and save a dollar correct?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dz8mx,Carter71980,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:06 2015 UTC,"Nothing. But the $5 you spend doesn't get taken out of the cost of the game - you get a 10% discount on the game, which I imagine will be about $4.50 total.  So you spend $5, get your $4.50 discount. But you have to be a member of EA Access at the time of Early Access to get it. So you'd need to buy the EA Access/the game the month of release."

It will only give Xbox One EA Access members several days of a head start.  Sales-wise, that's a different story."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dz8mx,duncan3dc,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"Excellent! That should give me plenty of time to try it out and decide if I would like to purchase it. Great find! Now they just need to define how ""first"" is ""first."" Hopefully a month or more."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,Random_Shadowscale,10,Mon Jul 20 20:24:02 2015 UTC,"Personally I think multiple planets for each DLC is better but as long as the maps are diverse, sticking to one planet per DLC is ok (like your Coruscant example). For more famous planets and destinations they can make 2 or more maps, but I think the maps on the same planets need to be unique and not just a different layout with the same assets."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,mr__derp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"If Coruscant is featured, it should be a re imagining of it and the battles should be fought between the New Republic and Fallen Empire. That would be nice."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,MrSolid14,7,Tue Jul 21 12:02:24 2015 UTC,"This could be a stretch but I'm really hoping for a ""Death Star"" DLC. Basically a mode set like dog fighting in space where you try to destroy the Death Star as a Rebel or try to not have Yavin 4 or your fleet destroyed like in New Hope or Return of the Jedi. You could get a power up and be Luke in the y-wing or lando in the falcon and try to take down the two Death Stars. Or something similar of course.  The Death Star battles are some of the most iconic battles in Star Wars so I'm really hopefully something like this gets included. I would easily pay a little extra for this."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,MattieWookie69,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:37 2015 UTC,"They are all for the movies and iconic battles, so I would say it is highly likely we'll get the death star since its one of the most iconic things in star wars."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,WizenedCracker,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:58 2015 UTC,Except there never really was a battle in the Death Star. Just a couple people running around.   Now if we wanna talk space battles...
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,Unnamed_5oldier,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:04 2015 UTC,Technically they could do the trench approach and run without adding BF2-styled space battles. The way they have it now would seem you just supplant your planet below with the death star.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,theravensrequiem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:26 2015 UTC,I can't see how they can make a Star Wars Battlefront game withOUT the Death Star.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,MakinDessert,6,Tue Jul 21 00:07:43 2015 UTC,first one didnt have it.... :P
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,FlyingAce1015,5,Tue Jul 21 00:16:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the first one came out 11 years ago and had the CIS era to make up for it while in this one they're focusing exclusively on the Galactic Civil War era and leaving out exactly one of its most iconic features, the freaking Death Star   Plus, weren't people saying you can't compare the two since this is a reboot?   So it's not okay to compare the two when it shows that this one is missing content of the prequels like clone war and space mode, yet, when people say 'why no X feature' it's okay to reply 'Well, the prequels didn't have them either' - so what gives, can we compare or not?   Seems like we can only do it when it benefits the upcoming game"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,JollyWhiskerThe4th,4,Tue Jul 21 03:38:07 2015 UTC,"Hoping for Bespin, Dagobah, Death Star, and Yavin Maps. If they did two maps for each planet they could have two doc packs. Maybe do an Episode IV pack with DS and Yavin and a V pack with Dagobah and Bespin. A space battle DLC with four maps would be nice too."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,Camdolin,4,Mon Jul 20 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for multiple, this game doesn't have more than one era so I'm at least hoping for more than 3 planets i don't count jakku cause i subscribe to the tin hat jakku=tatooine theory. (the odds of 2 desert planets both with bomar monk architecture and both operating criminal palaces is pretty low. especially considering that jabrams seems to have a hard on for sticking to the original trilogy) i cant see him making a new planet if its just gonna be exactly the same as tatooine."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,budgie88,2,Tue Jul 21 01:09:37 2015 UTC,I'm with you on that.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,theravensrequiem,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:18 2015 UTC,Diversity is key here. Maybe 2 planets with 2-3 maps each for $15? So 4-6 maps in various climates for $15.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,khovland92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"I thought the industry was moving away from selling maps as DLC, as it obviously split the community.   Personally I think EA is smart enough not to provide map DLC, but rather sell some in game currency for crafting or something. You can only sell a map once per customer, but you can sell them a gazzillion crafting currencies."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,komatius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:03:54 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to how much revenue the game takes in.

Cause they should do alot, such as include more maps at launch and not hold them all back to milk us with DLC. Thats actually the opposite of what they will do probably  I have a feeling the DLC wont be that simple. It will be themed more. Like one DLC will be all about the new movie (maps and characters) The next might be Clone Wars. Then space battles, etc"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,Unnamed_5oldier,4,Mon Jul 20 21:25:14 2015 UTC,"As cool as it would be, I kinda doubt they will include any clone war stuff."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,MakinDessert,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:30 2015 UTC,"DICE dlc's are usually themed so there must be something in common between the maps. It could be the planet, or it could a playstyle. Now i have a question: people complain about the lack of planets but they always use prequel era planets as example and i don't think they want to use them  1) they can't use them due to disney 2) they want to save them for the next battlefront or 3) they can't use that phototecnology whose name i can't remember. If we exclude those planet, what remains apart from Bespin, yavin iv (looks like endor to me) and the deathstar? Would they need to make them up like sullust?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,scrawny98,3,Mon Jul 20 21:54:30 2015 UTC,"I would love if they made some Legends planets or planets mentioned in the movies like Sullust. Such as Nar Shaddaa, Taris,  Manaan, etc."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dzk91,GenRhysDallows,2,Tue Jul 21 11:58:55 2015 UTC,"Even if they stick solely to planets that are only seen or referenced in the OT, there's still quite a few options they can pick from:  Corellia, Kessel, Alderaan (pre-kaboom), Dantooine, Yavin IV, Ord Mantell, Bespin, Dagobah, Taanab. Maybe Coruscant and Naboo if they count the special editions.  Then you have the interiors of various ships/space stations like Star Destroyers, the Tantive, the Death Star I/II, etc."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dva3k,SpookyJedi,28,Mon Jul 20 17:20:53 2015 UTC,I had my suspicions after I read the post. So I asked him what the power up looked like to which he replied it had a lightsaber. I was actually at E3 and although I didn't play as Luke I got stuck on the floor with the devs because there was a miscount for the session I was in line for. They had 41 people so I offered to wait another 15 mins. I spent the time talking to the devs and I asked about heroes they said that you could only play as Luke in the E3 build and no Vader. One of the devs even helped me try to track down the powerup but we never found it. When I asked him what it look like he said it had a line and almost looked like the emblem of the rebellion. So the lightsaber comment seemed like a bit off to me. I couldn't call him out on it because I had no proof though.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dva3k,WackyModder84,31,Sun Jul 19 20:42:55 2015 UTC,it had a line and almost looked like the emblem of the rebellion. So the lightsaber comment seemed like a bit off to me   cough cough
StarWarsBattlefront,3dva3k,MyAnonAccountHehe,12,Sun Jul 19 21:19:00 2015 UTC,I can't believe I didn't think of that. Although I'm surprised he didn't just say that or a lightsaber when he described it. I'm back where I was before this post. Although the Vader comment still raises concerns.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dxneh,Zartayus,7,Mon Jul 20 11:29:26 2015 UTC,These are all the guys that have been officially announced:  Villians: Darth Vader & Boba Fett  Heroes: Luke Skywalker  I'm not sure about Kylo Ren in the main game as Jakku is the only TFA thing announced and that's DLC. I think there'll be a TFA player DLC with Kylo Ren and the rest.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dxneh,JayBox325,6,Mon Jul 20 12:11:46 2015 UTC,"The Jakku thing is supposed to take place when the Battle of Jakku occurred, which is only 1 year after the Battle of Endor. It's a pretty safe bet that Kylo Ren (or any TFA characters) won't be in it."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dxneh,sol217,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:31 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I thought they mentioned early on that TFA DLC in addition to Jakku would be available after the film is released (to avoid spoilers).

They rebelled against a legitimate government elected by representatives of the republic.  They are outlaws causing a civil war across an entire galaxy causing innumerable casualties.   My point is the empire maybe the good guys even if the emperor is evil. Let’s not be so quick to assign titles to people.

The collectibles were pages of a comic-book about how Jango became the last Lord Mandalore before the Clone Wars, which I found really interesting.  I'd still love to play a Boba Fett game.  Maybe Bioware will re-skin a Mass Effect idea to make a new Bounty Hunter game."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvifi,JediGuyB,4,Mon Jul 20 04:19:02 2015 UTC,All I want is a damn good Open World Star Wars game to be honest.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvifi,phantom1942,3,Mon Jul 20 12:15:59 2015 UTC,"The closest  you'll get is Star Wars Galaxies,  KOTOR, or TOR. The issue with making an open world Star Wars game is that the Galaxy is so expanse,  that if you stuck to one planet and said that it was open world,  people would be mad that you couldn't traverse to specific planets or other worlds and it  would be hard to explain to the player why they couldn't with the easy availability of star ships everywhere.   With linear games,  it easy to explain to someone why they can't because they're being lead through the plot almost entirely by the game designers.  They can make the planet have a port lock down,  they can make the character a soldier on a mission,  etc.    Personally,  I think it could work if they did it like Assassin's Creed and had 3-5 large hub cities, kind of like KOTOR,  and have them run around those areas doing things.  But it would also be kind of hard to design an open world game around Star Wars, I think.  There are just too many options and things to do in that universe.  But that's probably why I'm not a game designer."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvifi,Wilwheatonfan87,3,Mon Jul 20 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"I think a Star Wars game like No Man's Sky would be awesome, but unlike No Man's Sky people would expect specific planets, not randomized planets, so it'd be so much work that it wouldn't be worth it."

The bigger question is this:  When it becomes apparent that this depth has been mortgaged away in the name of accessibility, is anyone (i.e. the community at large) going to take DICE to task for it or are folks just going to keep up their white knighting and say ""don't like it don't play it"", or ""it's Star Wars, it's fun, don't care""?

Outside of gaming, of course a white knight is someone who stands up for others with some kind of obsession about defending.   On the internet though,  how many times have you seen people that defend against complaints about decisions DICE has made, without actually saying that they themselves actively and affirmatively agree with DICE's decision?  Yes, some do, but many are indeed defending in matters where they don't actually care which way it goes, they just keep complaining about complaints."

If you don't like the direction this game is taking, that's fine. The best way to voice your opinion is by not buying the game, not by venting on a (relatively) small internet board.   The majority of the people here are here because they are interested in this game. If you can't accept some people are looking forward to it (with scepticism or not) then perhaps you should find something else to occupy your time."

Hugely disappointing mechanics including all the worst aspects that DICE have brought to us in these past few years inc major vehicles on rails, constantly dumbing down of flight mechanics, god awful gunplay, solo/casual style of play (ie fuck teamwork).  It sounds great and looks great that is unfortunately the only good things I have to say about this game and that breaks my heart"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,JGStonedRaider,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:20:05 2015 UTC,"Most people who have played the Alpha disagrees with you and including myself. The game looks amazing, plays great and the sound is pure eargasm. The flying mechanics needs fixing and that's it.   The game is very promising and to say that this game won't have or doesn't have any depth because of the Alpha is just nonsense. We don't have the full game with all the mechanics such heroes and vehicles and more.   Edit: This guy is a troll. Don't take him seriously."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,HolyKnightPrime,3,Sun Jul 19 17:24:40 2015 UTC,I have not heard a single PC alpha player back up this view (I also played the alpha).

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Kiw1Fruit,7,Mon Jul 20 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"How am I a troll? I was a top competitive BF4 player for ages, played the original SWBF and was very much looking forward to this. That said, I am not a blind fan boy who will praise things just for the hell of it. There are major issues with this game that won't be fixed by (heroes and vehicles)  The vehicles are not just broken but unrewarding, there is little enjoyment from ""learning"" the AT-AT on rails where in games like BF and previous SWBF titles you could be a vehicles specialist.   Flight mechanics hopefully will get a rework but this is doubtful as this is catering to kids and accessibility rather than being a high powered vehicle that is actually useful.  DICE have also implied that there won't be vehicle spawns and that it's going to be all pickups.  No reason for teamwork in the alpha, while this may change I can't see how atm. It's very much rewarding solo play rather than teamplay as there are no squads / support abilities (ammo/medic) that we have seen.  So all in all very disappointing. However I am sure this will cater to a lot of people but for me, it's almost dead in the water before release.    edit..spelling"

After reaching Lvl140 in Bf4 I went to CSGO and looking now at Battlefront it looks like a run & gun game for kids where you hop in and leave during a match - but nothing one wants to master and play for 2 or 3 years. Also the aim looks extremely laggy. Everyone is overshooting."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,softskiller,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:45 2015 UTC,This sounds vaguely like BF4 and particularly Hardline.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Slev23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:22:38 2015 UTC,Is competitive BF4 even a thing? wot? How do you have comp in a 64 player game
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Shitpoe_Sterr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:25:21 2015 UTC,5v5 and 8v8 have been staple of competitive BF since BF2 and maybe earlier although I wouldn't know as I started playing at the end of BF2.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,JGStonedRaider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:02 2015 UTC,"Strange. I don't know why you'd want a game like Battlefield for that scale of combat when there are so many better alternatives (CSGO, Insurgency to name a few)"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Shitpoe_Sterr,-5,Tue Jul 21 20:29:57 2015 UTC,Competitive BF4 lol... you scrim bro? The majority of BF4 players don't use a mic and play by themselves and lone wolf. Is there even competitive BF4?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,MattDeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:50:09 2015 UTC,"He played for Team UK and has a couple of thousand hours between BF3 and BF4. Everyone I have spoken to who played the alpha, conclude with the general feedback that this is a game for casuals.  I can see why this may appeal to console players who are more causal in nature. If you look at the popularity of other causal FPS like hardline and call of duty I have no doubt that this game will do well on consoles and be a total flop on PC."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Kiw1Fruit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:17:00 2015 UTC,Casual games exist on PC.... it won't be a total flop considering that it is a star wars game.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,MattDeee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:40 2015 UTC,That's a fair point but like JG I'm not going to invest a lot of time into something if there is not a high skill ceiling. Like Hardline it will probably sell well but I suspect it won't hold a large PC audience on PC. It will do very well on console.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Kiw1Fruit,0,Tue Jul 21 07:56:11 2015 UTC,"That's the impression I've gotten from watching gameplay.   I really hope they add more dramatic roll for air vehicles, and fixed spawns would be nice.   Although, I think the reason they went with vehicle pickups is to avoid the whole waiting without spawning we saw in BF3 and 4. People waiting for ages to nab that jet or helicopter.   And transports would be nice as well."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,flipett,-3,Sun Jul 19 17:32:30 2015 UTC,DICE has hinted that Vehicles pickups is only for Walker Assault. We don't know yet. All the more reasons for people to not jump into conclusion.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,HolyKnightPrime,0,Sun Jul 19 17:58:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry for asking but I haven't seen any videos and don't want to. I want to experience it when I buy it but, how do vehicle pick ups work?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,kodran,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:50:53 2015 UTC,"You play as infantry and find floating holograms.   When you walk over the hologram, it gets slotted in an open spot on your loadout.   You press that spots button and you spawn into the vehicle. Air vehicles spawn already flying.  There's a brief period where youre vulnerable and kneeling while you spawn into the vehicle."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,flipett,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"You're going to buy it blindly? Not even go off of reviews? I mean I guess you could trade it back or sell it if you don't like it, but it kinda sounds like a waste of time."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,theravensrequiem,0,Mon Jul 20 05:48:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah haha. I can afford to do that once or maybe twice a year. I'm mostly a patient gamer but being this game I will probably read some comments like this, but not stop from buying it unless it is day one broken."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,kodran,3,Mon Jul 20 06:25:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's definitely not the game I've been waiting 10 years for.  All we can do is refuse to buy it. If enough people do that, they'll get the message that we don't want this dumbed-down, rushed out shit."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,throwawayea1,14,Sun Jul 19 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""enough people"" will be an approachable number for this game. It's Star Wars, and says Battlefront on the cover."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,deftPirate,5,Sun Jul 19 16:43:07 2015 UTC,And it's being released a month before the sequel to Return of the Jedi. The hype and anticipation around that will be enough to sell a ton of copies.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,ifleninwasawizard,4,Sun Jul 19 20:37:11 2015 UTC,It's like Palpatine maneuvering for control of the galaxy.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,deftPirate,3,Sun Jul 19 20:44:15 2015 UTC,Lost sales are lost sales. If everyone buys it they'll keep doing it.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,deftPirate,8,Sun Jul 19 19:14:04 2015 UTC,Rushed out?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,ScruffCo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:51 2015 UTC,Its not that bad.... I haven't played but from what I have seen and heard it still  seems like a good game.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,VideoGameJeff,-6,Sun Jul 19 15:59:41 2015 UTC,Yes and had uninstalled again after 2hrs of trying my best to like it. Oh well back to high skill ceiling games like CSGO and Dirty Bomb
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,JGStonedRaider,15,Sun Jul 19 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"Huh. Welp, im still looking forward to it. I guess im not surprised about it being more casual, that's how the original Battlefronts got such a widespread following I believe. Shame ya didn't dig it, im still holding out for it!"

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,JGStonedRaider,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:28:44 2015 UTC,"I just want to tell you that the flight mechanics in DICE games have notoriously improved since BC2.  The current flight model for BF4 is an excellent blend of realism and arcade, at least for helicopters."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Satsumomo,0,Mon Jul 20 17:42:35 2015 UTC,"Erm no, as one of the top competitive Heli pilots in the world for BF3/BF4 I can tell you that they are nothing compared to BF2 helis.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,JGStonedRaider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"I never said it was better than BF2's, only that saying the flight model was getting worse is a disingenuous comment."

I feel like this could be more related to personal preference than to game quality  casual gameplay style- we've seen 2 game modes.  There are still 8 others.  I remain optimistic that there will be modes that require much more teamwork"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,butchthedoggy,33,Mon Jul 20 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"OP is referring to the meat of the game, what's going to keep a player coming back. So far I'm in agreement, DICE hasn't shown us a lot that is making me want this game aside from pretty graphics and sounds. BF 1 and 2 still have this reboot beaten, and that's sad."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,ShadySim,33,Sun Jul 19 14:59:45 2015 UTC,"BF 1 and 2 still have this reboot beaten, and that's sad.   BF 1 and 2 aren't deep. At all."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,graciliano,9,Sun Jul 19 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Not by today's standards, you're right. But for their day, ten (+) years ago, they were some of the first of their kind, and were some of the most in-depth FPS games I'd played, outside of Battlefield 2, which was also out at the time. It's disappointing because they haven't really improved upon much besides game engine. And the overall appearance of the game has been altered enough to where it is unrecognizable as a sibling or grandchild of OG Battlefront. It's still got the same mechanics, but the feel of the game has been altered significantly. That's where Battlefront 3 would've shined.   I just hope this game can stand on its own two feet. We've had a lot of FPS games come out in the last 10 years, and the market is heavily saturated."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,SgtDirtyMike,-3,Sun Jul 19 20:19:15 2015 UTC,You need to play some better FPSs then because things like Quake have Battlefront beat so comprehensively in depth it's not even funny.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Blubbey,5,Mon Jul 20 10:25:51 2015 UTC,"I've played Quake and Doom but neither are my type of game unfortunately. I believe Battlefield 2 has all of those games beaten, with full squad support and commander mode. Project Reality mod still lives on today."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,SgtDirtyMike,2,Mon Jul 20 14:14:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by 'deep'  The guy you're replying to defines deep as what's going to keep a player coming back, and to that you said BF 1 and BF II weren't deep, in other words, that there aren't enough reasons for the players to keep coming back but that's simply not true given the amount of fun content (maps, classes, modes, etc.) the games still  provide."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,JollyWhiskerThe4th,4,Sun Jul 19 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"Well, i'm not pre-ordering anything.  I am going to have to see a lot of reviews and gameplay after launch that's not scripted or deleted within minutes from being posted on the internet to be convinced."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Supersounds,4,Sun Jul 19 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"Without a fuckload of DLCs to put everything back, then no, probably not."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,feelingverysexual,4,Sun Jul 19 13:35:59 2015 UTC,There ARE a ton more weapons and equipment. This is why freaking NDA's exist. People think they've seen it all when they look at the alpha footage. There is still a lot more to this game.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,khovland92,3,Sun Jul 19 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"I know there's more, but there need to be LOADS more."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,JollyWhiskerThe4th,4,Sun Jul 19 19:28:27 2015 UTC,That video is so painfully sad to watch. =/
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,theravensrequiem,9,Mon Jul 20 05:55:00 2015 UTC,"I was reading your comment thinking ""he wont get what I want,"" then BAM, large chaotic battles. Star wars is a large scale battle, tonnes going on, enough for every different play style.   Want a competitive game, play CS:GO. Want a realistic game, play Arma. Want a DICE game, play Battlefield.   Star Wars TO ME is a large scale, ground, space, infantry, ships, lasers, good environment and the few classes with unique differences.   Obviously, that's not the same as everyone else thinks and would take more time to produce, just wish next time they'll go for a different approach."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Holy__cow,2,Sun Jul 19 19:47:29 2015 UTC,But this isn't large scale. 64 players has been a DICE standard. Now we have 40 and a fairly small battlefield.

Yet how many Star Wars games, even the great ones, actually fit this mold?  Tie Fighter and X-Wing, arguably two of the best Star Wars games of all time, were just space battles.  Jedi Outcast and Academy were just small scale FPS.  KotOR was a simple RPG.    The best advice I could give people on this sub is to calm down and manage your expectations.  Play the game for what it is, not what you are convinced it has to be (and never claimed to be).  Judge it on its own merits.  Also, removing any rose-tinted eyewear also tends to help."

Why not implement things that are obviously cool that they created in their past games? Just to avoid being to similar to Battlefield? Squads are awesome. 64 players is amazing and expansive. It's clear as well that this game won't be as team-oriented. Why would putting these things in be an issue? It would still be Battlefront. It makes much more sense to me as well to have vehicles just arrive at your HQ instead of having these cheesy power-up coins floating around in random places. I want vehicles to be part of my army, not just a power-up bonus type thing. Why avoid Battlefield features just at the expense of being unique?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,braised_diaper_shit,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"I never wanted a reskin of BF3 or BF4, what I wanted was a sequel to Battlefront 2. What we have now looks more like a watered down BF4 with a few elements from Battlefront 2."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Tezla55,-6,Sun Jul 19 22:38:56 2015 UTC,I second that. That way it stays true to the old games which were a lot like Battlefield but with nicer graphics which everyone loves. I don't get why people weren't wanting a refreshing drink of that sweet Battlefield/front gameplay we all loved....
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,phantom1942,3,Sun Jul 19 16:16:16 2015 UTC,"Alpha tester here, after playing one round of Walker Assault I had already felt like I experienced everything the game had to offer and felt no urge to play again.  This game along with many others in the past couple years are/will suffer from ""consolitis"", which is when gameplay is designed with the most casual players in mind (oversimplified mechanics like vehicles on rails or power up icons are examples of this). Casual gamers are people that need instant gratification, have very short attention spans and need tricks (ie: DLC, quick time events, etc...) to keep them entertained which cheapens the experience.  They do not want deep gaming mechanics because they do not have any interest or the attention span to learn or master them. Casual players make up a greater portion of the gaming population whether it be console or PC gaming. Since games are created to make money they will be designed to capture the largest gaming population in mind (casual gamers) which in turn will increase the profitability of the game.  Evolve is a great example of this, neat concept but executed with the casual gamer in mind, no depth and now currently a ""dead"" game.  One could argue that Destiny is a similar situation but not a dead game by any means, though I stopped playing a while ago.  Bottom line, I will wait to buy this when it is in the sale bin as I do not believe its value to be $60."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Fureak,13,Mon Jul 20 21:21:42 2015 UTC,"I would say wait for more information. This is DICE. When it comes to multiplayer, they know their shit. They're not Respawn Entertainment. They wouldn't ship a MULTIPLAYER ONLY title without a large amount of unlocks and customization items.   This game has had more dev time than Battlefield 4, which had a full fledged campaign and an incredibly deep unlock system from day 1. If you're basing your opinion of Battlefront off of the alpha, which had only 4 usable weapons, 2 fixed star card sets, no heroes, and 1 map, you need to chill. We still don't know jack shit about the game. Wait for more information to come out before saying this game is doomed for mediocrity."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,SumB1tchRaptor,4,Sun Jul 19 17:22:43 2015 UTC,More or less how I feel.   People forget an alpha is severely gimped in terms of the full game.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,flipett,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"BF4 was also a game on the same engine as the previous game they'd made, in the same setting  and reused a load of assets. This game they are starting fresh so and only had 2 years dev time. Assuming that everything is fine and we just need to wait is foolish. It's the sort of behaviour which leaves people blind sided when a game like Titanfall comes out and it only has 4 more guns than the alpha did. Let your concerns known while there is time for change, although with 4 months to go I suspect the game is pretty much locked down."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Hayt89,2,Mon Jul 20 01:24:36 2015 UTC,"Why is that a bad thing? Games don't need 150 weapons. Titanfall had all the guns it needed to function. Competitive FPS work better when the gun count is reasonable, BF4's weapons list is obscene and the amount of unlocks is detrimental to the game. If BF4 had three-quarters of it's stuff cut before development started on them the game would play better, be better balanced, be more refined, have the totally useless stuff they wasted their time on gone, and probably would have worked better on release and the following 6 months. Let's hope they learnt their lesson and Battlefront doesn't have a load of useless crap there for no reason other than to be there dragging it down and is closer to Titanfall instead."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Crack-The-Skye,0,Mon Jul 20 16:52:20 2015 UTC,"I dont think (s)he is complaining about the weapon count, I think they are saying how the actual game didnt have much more content than the alpha, so the alpha was more than just a small fragment of the complete product"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,chimi_the_changa,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:48:28 2015 UTC,Titanfall had far too few of everything. That's why people stopped playing it. They mastered the 10 guns and maps and moved on because the flavour had gone out of it like a stick of gum.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Hayt89,0,Tue Jul 21 01:36:01 2015 UTC,Maps are different than guns. And Titan fall died because the gameplay wasn't that deep.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Crack-The-Skye,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:43:30 2015 UTC,Yes and what we've see of Battlefront has a similar level of depth. We have little to no systems that encourage teamplay or anything beyond killing the enemy. I get where you are coming from but surely you can't knowingly endorse a game having so little content that requires any level of skill or mastery.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Hayt89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:36 2015 UTC,"That's a bold statement for a game that isn't even out and has shown little. So no, I'm not going to say anything about the content or gameplay depth as I have no way of knowing, I would be just talking out my ass about stuff I don't know about.   Come release and lets say both your claims turn out to be true, yes, i would not be endorsing it. Not because it lacks piles useless shit to unlock, but because the gameplay is shallow. Even if it did one up BF4 with a new level of useless shit, I still wouldn't endorse it if actually playing it wasn't engaging. Pointless weapons skins mean fuck all, terrible weapon ideas shoehorned in don't work, there's a limit to how much you can functionally and uniquely balance, and unlock systems get you in the door but do not actually make a game enjoyable in the long term. BF4 would be better off with a more mid ground between its and Titanfalls approach to weapons, and Battlefront would be too independently of how engaging it is to play."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Crack-The-Skye,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:07:03 2015 UTC,The whole point of my post is that you cant assume the alpha isnt representative. It happened with Titanfall. People assumed the full game would have way more than the alpha and it didn't.   As for your complaints about BF4 I'll just say people still play BF4 and people still don't play Titanfall.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Hayt89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:22:47 2015 UTC,"Representative of what? No game puts their entire unlock scheme in an alpha or beta.   Yes, and it has to do with gameplay, not the amount of useless shit they added. I still play BF4, and while it's fun it's obvious to anyone who has played it the amount of stuff weighs it down, too much stuff that just simply doesn't work. And anyone who played near release knows the last thing they needed to be working on before release was more unlocks."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Crack-The-Skye,17,Tue Jul 21 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"The game is out in less than 4 months, so they have at the very most 3 months of development left, and they haven't even had their beta yet.  With this amount of time left, NO MECHANICS WILL CHANGE OR BE ADDED/REMOVED BETWEEN NOW AND RELEASE.  BF4 would've been in beta by now, and that released a steaming, buggy shit, so I think we'll be lucky just to get a working game on release.  I don't think there'll be much depth at all. Battlefield has loads of weapons but they're pretty much all the same with slight differences in stats. It seems we won't even be able to choose different types of weapons since they're all pickups. There might be more gadgets, but I hate what we've seen of them so far. And vehicles, fuck. They've already said Y-wings and TIE bombers won't be flyable, and due to this awful token system it's clear that there won't be any multi-seater vehicles, no transports, etc.  I think the only area where there could be any depth is the cosmetic customization, but I'm expecting that to be packed with microtransactions.  Overall it seems like some little arcade shooter, except for the sound and graphics. But as much as I disagree with people who say ""graphics aren't important"", they're definitely the least important part of the game. Sadly it seems to be the only aspect DICE bothered with."

Its exhausting reading all the posts from people saying they still have time to do major additions and other potential big changes (ex. Spacebattles DLC).

Yes, an RPG and thermal imploder are some of the pickups available, but there are also lots of star cards we have not yet seen that could include other types of RPGs, grenades, grenade launchers, and we also know from a datamined file that you flamethrowers are a weapon, but it does remain to be seen whether or not those are pickups or star cards.   and due to this awful token system it's clear that there won't be any multi-seater vehicles, no transports, etc.   We have seen 1 game mode with vehicles.  That's it.  I don't think that's a fair assumption to make at all."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,deftPirate,7,Sun Jul 19 16:38:26 2015 UTC,SWB is not being made to appeal to the average battlefront fan it is being made so that children can play it. You think Disney is gonna let a SW game be made that isn't accessible to the 7-10 year old audience you are crazy. Don't expect depth expect accessibility.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Bojtea,12,Sun Jul 19 14:59:19 2015 UTC,"Kids aren't stupid though. They can learn and understand more than people give them credit for and I think giving them an in-depth game would be better for them.  ""but they don't have the attention spans"". If this is true I think it's because all the games they're given ARE NOT in depth and have low replay value. Why should they keep their attention on one game?  You may be correct in saying this is why they won't make the game as in-depth and complex as they should, but they should not be holding dice back."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,DreamSeaker,10,Sun Jul 19 15:27:04 2015 UTC,This a thousand times. I played BF1942 as a 12 year old and it was amazing.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,phantom1942,-2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:12 2015 UTC,1942 wasn't exactly the deepest game out there.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,flipett,4,Sun Jul 19 17:05:12 2015 UTC,The flying mechanics were actually fairly complex while still being approachable. Planes spawned in hangars and you had to actually fly them to the enemy. They had fully flyable bombers with multiple positions for your friends.  And that's just the planes.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,The5thElephant,0,Sun Jul 19 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"I know, I still have and play the game on CD.   The gunplay was nonexistent by today's standards, bazookas were the end all be all, and very little strategy really existed otherwise.   I'll admit dogfights were actually skillfull in 1942, but I don't think having to take off a plane and having multiple positions gives it depth."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,flipett,3,Sun Jul 19 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Multiperson vehicles, spotting for artillery, spotting system, mobile player controlled bases on navy maps, something insane like 10+ factions each with different loadouts, repairable vehicles, medic system and this is a 13 fucking year old game."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,DreamSeaker,0,Sun Jul 19 18:48:08 2015 UTC,Implying that Battlefront and Battlefront 2 had depth?  Because they didn't.  That franchise has always been casual and that's not a bad thing.  It wasn't then and it's not now.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,MsgGodzilla,3,Mon Jul 20 14:40:40 2015 UTC,So it's going to be like Titanfall.  Really fun but no depth.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,youilliteratefuck,3,Sun Jul 19 20:39:48 2015 UTC,I openly challenge DICE to prove the people in this thread wrong. I'd love to be wrong. Show us the depth.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Hayt89,7,Sun Jul 19 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"Watch them put up a picture of the Mariana Trench..... ""Is that deep enough?"""
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,phantom1942,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of 'depth'.  The Battlefield series, even without the trappings of Battlefront like heroes, has pretty deep gameplay.  It helps that it tends to be objective based, teamplay.  Missing features doesn't really equate to lacking depth.  A game can be simple as fuck feature-wise, and have a shitload of depth.  See, chess or even something like Rocket League.  Too many people seem to think that options = depth, when that really isn't true."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,DFu4ever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:37 2015 UTC,They have already stated that the game is aimed at teens and younger and no doubt they under the delusion all kids like shallow game-play (and that the average age of gamers is actually 30+).
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,BigglesKDH,0,Tue Jul 21 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm kinda at a loss in what depth would mean in this Battlefront?   There's been a lot of talk from DICE about the immersive and authentic aspect in this game, but I see that to be talking about the efforts put in to make the game looks/sounds like you're in the Star Wars world. The depth being referred could be on whether it feels like Star Wars when playing? A clear distinction between Battlefront and other games?  meh I don't know :|  I made a comment along the lines this a while ago, but I doubt that to fully be addressing the issue at hand."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,WantedtoPostThis,11,Sun Jul 19 13:41:21 2015 UTC,I don't think people are refering to visual quality as depth. Personally I've never heard that word used in that way myself. People are concerned that the gameplay will be simple and that there is not much meat for experienced players to dig into.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Hayt89,5,Sun Jul 19 13:54:16 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, the Battlefront series has always been aimed at the casual gamer crowd; I'm not saying DICE has to ""limit"" themselves though  What can be done to add some depth to gameplay then?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,WantedtoPostThis,13,Sun Jul 19 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"Bring back classes, so people have specialized roles to work with: Only some people can have jetpacks, only some people can have rocket launchers, and there should be actual reloading so ammo is something that's needed. Remove the instant health regeneration so a medic is useful. Put vehicles at each team's spawn so pilots can help during the battle. Basically, the old BF games.  As it stands this game is like CoD- you just pick whatever equipment you want and run out on to the field killing people with no teamwork. You could stay alive indefinitely since you don't need ammo or health, as long as you're good enough. And getting bonuses like heroes and vehicles at any time makes that even worse. It doesn't help that there's only 40 players and not even as many maps and gamemodes as before. I'm sure there will be more usable equipment before launch but the core game mechanics are just so shallow now."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,1336plus1,4,Sun Jul 19 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"I think I'm ok with the weapons not having ammo, because simply put almost every other game in existence has ammo and it's something different. Although I was not a part of the alpha.  I pretty much agree with everything else you said though. Especially the health system I am not a fan of that. There's no more scrambling looking for those medical droids or blasting away at an enemy hoping desperately that they drop a bacta pod cause your in the middle of capturing a point.  Oh also capture points?? Are they in I've heard nothing about them."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,DreamSeaker,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"It won't work with 20 ppl at each team. They want people to focus on fighting each other, not camping on the vehicles spawn points.  Actually, as it stand, this game is like CoD+Enemy Terrtritory (wolfenstine) and Battlefield COMBINED - and this is a good thing.  As I see it, the core of this game is more like ET:Wolfenstine, that old free multiplayer game. Each group of maps has a specefic game mode designed for it with a specefic objectives. This is what kept ppl playing this game. This kind of design is much more deeper than ""ok, we're gonna throw you on that desert map, now get the other team's flags!"" - which is the core of Battlefield/front old games.   And the good thing? we've only saw ONE multiplayer game mode, and there are at least 2 more. Assuming each of the modes will be as deep as Walker Assault, we're gonna be more than fine."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Echo693,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:24:59 2015 UTC,That's why we have BF4.   Play Battlefront for your fixing of fun fast paced insanity and BF4 for (occasional) teamplay.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,flipett,2,Sun Jul 19 17:07:14 2015 UTC,"No. We'll buy it without depth, so why pay DICE more to make the game good when a shiny version of a 90's shooter will make them a better margin?"

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,PiggeryJokery,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:51 2015 UTC,Based off of my alpha experience there is very little to no depth in the game currently.   Based off of the timeline that they have to get the game finished (~3 months) there will not be much time to add anything. So unfortunately your friend is probably right.   Will I still buy the game? Yes because even though there was no true depth to the gameplay it was still fun and will just serve as a casual shooter that's Star Wars themed.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,SupaReagan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:10 2015 UTC,How about we fucking wait until we see more of the game? We still don't know shit about this game. We're still months away from release. Give it some goddamn time!
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Crump_Dump,3,Mon Jul 20 07:30:50 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason as to why I think people are discussing so early on is because it'll bring attention to what could be done before ""it's too late"". As some have said, yes the game is months away from release, but this time is used to polish up, not to make serious changes.  I would like to think DICE is giving this 110%, but there is not much to go off to prove that right or wrong. Meh, I guess this is a waiting game"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,WantedtoPostThis,0,Mon Jul 20 11:56:22 2015 UTC,I mean does csgo have depth?  Currently one of the most popular shooters out there and you play the same maps with the same weapons every time and is still insanely fun.  I wouldn't worry about this stuff as long as you have fun with the game.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,Turtlefast27,6,Sun Jul 19 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"I say CSGO does have depth in term of gameplay. The reason people play the same maps/use the same weapons over and over again for many years is because they're trying master their skills. There are people who have been playing for years and still trying to master the technique of 1 tapping with the AK-47. Not to mention the other strategies like smoking spots, flash spots, spray control, different strats for attacking/defending the bomb, etc.   I feel Battlefront is a different style of game. People play it more for the enjoyment of running around as a Stormtrooper then learning about recoil/spray controls. The thing people are most worried about right now is how much content we'll be getting by the final release. It's really hard to say right now since DICE/EA barely revealed anything else besides showing off the core gameplay mechanics. We'll just have to wait and see."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,klusps,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:44 2015 UTC,I think the depth in CS:GO is telling when the developers are still patching maps with small changes such as adding small pieces of cover that can seriously affect how a round plays out.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,BoernerMan,-2,Mon Jul 20 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"Not really and that's okay. It's not battlefield: star wars: battlefront. It's a fresh start on battlefront and it doesn't needs to be crazy in depth. Maybe the second or third one will, but for now, it's simple star wars fun."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,McRioT,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:15:45 2015 UTC,It's called alpha for a reason.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtwjw,wakayoda,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"Is depth a bunch of poorly thought out, poorly balanced gadgets?  I think this game already has more depth than battlefield because of the addition of a shield and jetpack.  These are real, functional addition to the game... vs say... TUGS or AIR MINES or umm what else was stupid?  Plus most of the so called depth in Battlefield is only superficial, ie repair tool when vehicles repair themselves or med kits when players heal themselves.  So all that depth was already gone, the gadgets just forgot to bugger off.  So I think this game will have more depth in terms of real game play in the meat of the game.  I wish they would have sim level flight mechanics too."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,CSredPanda,8,Sun Jul 19 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"Blaster packs allowed something like 500 shots in the lore, so the guy that survives to fire 500 shots needs to get his ass on the battlefield."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,xzenocrimzie,3,Sun Jul 19 15:03:22 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised how little time it takes to fire 500 shots. In just a couple hours playing ArmA I managed to fire something like 25 magazines. 25x30 = 750 rounds.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,OCD_Loki,4,Sun Jul 19 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"But in a DICE-developed shooter, you won't be alive for a couple hours. Maybe five minutes if you're lucky. You won't be firing 500 shots in five minutes (most likely), and thus no point giving players 500 round mags."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,xzenocrimzie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"I slightly misunderstood, I thought we were talking lore-wise.   Yeah, 500 shots is hard to go through in a Battlefield game. I agree, no ammo is probably the best system for the game."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,ingyball,2,Sun Jul 19 21:18:20 2015 UTC,"I believe the LAAT Gun Ships used laser, and the Death Star was a laser but those are the only two that I know of."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,1336plus1,2,Sun Jul 19 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah now that I think about it they had them on the side guns. But still no small arms, that would just be ridiculous."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,JayBox325,18,Sun Jul 19 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"Infinite ammo I can live with as mentioned before the E-11 had packs with 500 shots... so maybe a reload required then would be better?  Infinite grenades is a bit much though. It should be that everyone has one (more is an option), then you can pick up refills in the pick-ups."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,TrueMarksmens,10,Sun Jul 19 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"I would like it if it wasn't only overheating. For example, if your gun overheats five times, you'll need to switch to a new blaster power pack; more commonly called ammo packs. My only reasoning for this is to be a little bit more lore accurate, but considering they're already putting gameplay infront of lore (not neccesarrily a bad thing in a multiplayer game), then I'm fine with the current overheating system.  Detonators, though? I wish those didn't have a cooldown. I wish you started with a few, depending on your loadout, and when you used those you had to find more out in the battlefield. Haven't seen enough gameplay though. Did they really have a cooldown?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Gamefreak975,16,Sun Jul 19 12:02:51 2015 UTC,"If we are being ""lore accurate"" nobody ever reloads in the movies."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,TrueMarksmens,3,Sun Jul 19 10:52:00 2015 UTC,The movies aren't the only part of canon. Though DICE seems to think so..
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Gamefreak975,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:33:21 2015 UTC,Can you show me one official source that has someone reloading a blaster?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,TrueMarksmens,5,Sun Jul 19 21:40:23 2015 UTC,"The Clone Wars. And considering that has over a hundred episodes, it'll be hard to pinpoint the exact minute of the exact episode. I'm certain you see clones reloading in the Second Battle of Geonosis and Umbara, and you can hear clones say multiple times throughout the series that they're running out of ammo."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Gamefreak975,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:53:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, touche.  However, blasters have likely been improved upon in the years following the Clone Wars. Perhaps they no longer require ammo."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Scaredycrow,4,Mon Jul 20 01:26:07 2015 UTC,Grenades do actually have ammo. However who's gonna be alive long enough to overheat their weapons 5 times lol. Makes no diff anyway
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,DreamSeaker,3,Mon Jul 20 01:31:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a bad idea. It might force players to try and not let their weapons overheat, and if it does happen now your secondary weapon must be used until finding ""ammo"". I think it would be a cool dynamic but doubtful it would happen.  What about overheating 3 times instead of 5. That would make the system much more relevant."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,MotherfuckingMoose,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. I haven't seen any indications of grenade ammo yet, only a cooldown.   That applies for the grenade launcher as well."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Mikey_MiG,2,Sun Jul 19 15:40:02 2015 UTC,I can't find it but I'm pretty sure I read that the grenade card will still have a limited number of uses tacked on with the cool down.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,deftPirate,4,Sun Jul 19 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"I thought it worked out pretty well in Battlefield 1943, so I hope they can balance it out well here."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,deftPirate,6,Sun Jul 19 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"Not super excited. Especially seeing all the places it doesn't make sense. Like the temporary shields have limited charges, but the triple grenade launcher just has a cool down? That makes no sense.  To be fair, the alpha gameplay didn't look like the nade spamfest that existed in the previous games, but it, along with the lack of ammo (and accompanying team play mechanics like resupply) is very discouraging."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Hayt89,2,Sun Jul 19 13:49:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to feel about the lack of teamplay either.   On one side its great to support a team and keep them fed with bullets, but it also sucks to run a more offensive role and have dipshit teammates who don't know the value of teamwork. .  By no means a justification for the removal of it, just hoping DICE finds a happy medium between lobe wolfing and too team oriented.   And while it doesn't look like a nadefest on Hoth, keep in mind it's a larger map, just like bigger maps in BF4 were OK with made spam."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,me2224,4,Sun Jul 19 18:17:43 2015 UTC,"True about the map size.  As for a happy medium, I don't expect to see it. A meaningful team play implementation just looks too far from the build they have now, and not enough time to change it. But it may be that the many cards we haven't seen will facilitate some team play."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Seravie,2,Sun Jul 19 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"We can hope.   Although I like the idea of team play, I'm sure I'll enjoy the game without it.   There are pros and cons of having extensive team dependence, and I think Battlefront will do OK.   I like to think it isn't too hard to model an ammo box and an animation for dropping it, but oh well, lets wait for launch."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,ImJohnsirz,6,Sun Jul 19 19:42:47 2015 UTC,I don't strongly dislike it but it one in a long list of things removing any need for a player to work in a team. Unlimited ammo makes the player entirely self-reliant. I like teamwork so this is a bummer to me.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Bravo777,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"I wanted ammo, they actually did have magazines (they were called blaster packs iirc) and because most of the guns in the movies are based on real ones they naturally have places for these. the pistol side arms on the other hand seemed to never have ammo, from the battlefront games to even republic commando. the way I see it is they are unlikely to implement it this late in development so we are stuck with overheating weather we like it or not"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,iash91,2,Sun Jul 19 12:42:16 2015 UTC,The only thing that annoys me is the grenade launcher + jetpacks.. and having that unlimited... will be annoying.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,HoratioRastapopulous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:53 2015 UTC,Ok with it considering the overheating aspect makes you time your shots and let's you make decisions on targets.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,Strikaaa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:05:24 2015 UTC,I wish the guns has some sort of ammo. Something like 20 shots and then you have to change power packs.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,WerTicusness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the idea at first. Then I watched gameplay. They really want you to die ASAP in the game (to keep the battlefield from feeling empty), so I doubt ammo is going to be that big of a concern, and the request for ammo count would die pretty quickly once in the hands of customers."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,SuperSmith_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:42 2015 UTC,I'm fine without ammo.  It allows for what would've been the reload button to be used for another function.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,WerTicusness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:53 2015 UTC,You can still reload to prevent overheating.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,TheSceneYouHate,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:37 2015 UTC,there was actually ammo for grenades.  no ammo for guns makes no difference since you never run out of it before you die in BF4/3 anyway.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dtnfv,LibertarianHandlebar,4,Mon Jul 20 19:24:18 2015 UTC,You might not die before running out of ammo.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dtv1s,Hayt89,10,Sun Jul 19 12:53:04 2015 UTC,I think it would get really annoying seeing so many different colors flying everywhere. Also we really don't know anything about customization yet.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dp3xg,ibrarito_14,3,Sat Jul 18 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there are other imperial-only missions.   If we stick too closely to ""movie authenticity"" then the Empire should auto-win Hoth walker assault."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dp3xg,Gamefreak975,2,Sat Jul 18 17:33:28 2015 UTC,Please correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the whole point of The Battle of Hoth was to buy time for the Rebels to evacuate Echo Base. Would that classify as a ''Survival Mission?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dp3xg,WackyModder84,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"It would probably fit nicely into that, yeah. It was purely a survival mission.  Thats why I would've liked to see a Hoth mission that involved protecting transports leaving the surface. It wouldve given the X-wings and TIEs something to do other than dogfight and peck at the ground and it wouldve been more ""authentic"" to boot.  As we currently have it, Walker Assault is a direct military engagement on exactly equal footing.   Not movie authentic in the slightest. Not a BAD thing, per se, just not authentic like it is being branded.  If I were deciding the game mode, I would've made the Ywings disable the AT-ATs with Ion Bombs rather than making them destructible. The only way to kill them, IMO, should be with the tow-cable takedown. The objectives should be: Rebels - Protect the generator for a certain amount of time. Imperials - Destroy the generator /  a certain number of Rebel transports.   Destroying the generator should be an inevitability and then once it is destroyed, the Rebels on the ground could protect the uplinks to coordinate the Ion Cannon Nipple Gun control to fire on spaceborne Star Destroyers to give the transports more time to escape.   That being said, the graphics look pretty damn cool."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dp3xg,WackyModder84,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"I like your suggestion with the Rebels having to protect base generator/Empire targets ships evacuating Echo Base. It would be nice if Dice would add a Sandbox/ Mission Editor mode with full control of mission parameters. With the game's incredible graphics and level of detail of its assets (weapon, vehicles, character models) I would love to see what the community could come up with."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dp3xg,ShatterNL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:36:08 2015 UTC,We can only hope. Halo 3's Forge Mode got me really excited for the future of gaming but as a medium games have really halted in terms of forward progress. With the exception of graphics that is.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dp3xg,ChechenGorilla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:56:43 2015 UTC,"Let's analyze these ""answers"" a bit....   1.) No Shit? I'd be very concerned if that wasn't the case.  2.) TRANSLATION: ""It is absolutely 100% mandatory for us to make sure that this game gets launched and put out there before Episode VII gets released in theatres by any means necessary. So unfortunately, we don't have enough time to throw it in there before we launch the game on November 17th. But on the plus side, be sure to buy the Space Combat DLC for the low price of $14.99 that will be officially announced and revealed some time after the game has launched, though! =D""  3.) Like Hell, you aren't. You're just saying that because the game's not even out yet, and are releasing details little by little as we draw closer and closer to November 17th. I can already smell the impending Post-Launch DLC Announcements coming from A Mile Away. Stop trying. You're not fooling anyone, EA.  4.) Fair Enough. Nothing wrong about that.  5.) Well, maybe DICE should have thought about that before choosing you guys as their publisher. OH, WAIT! That's right. Disney is the biggest one to blame for that happening. Since they thought choosing you guys, of all fucking people, to be in charge of Star Wars Games for the foreseeable future was a Good Idea. Which means that if DICE wanted to make any Star Wars game, not just Battlefront, they would literally have No Choice but to go with EA as their publisher because of Disney. So fuck them even more.  6.) Well, so much for that, then. That was something I was kinda hoping was gonna happen. Pink Darth Vaders running rampant would have been fucking hilarious to watch. XD  7.) Old News Is Old, and yet it still makes me mad every time I hear it.  8.) ROFL! The fact that they even responded to an Obvious Troll is just hilarious. I'll give them props for that one!  9.) The Force is anything but strong with This Game, sad to say. Or at least, not without a fuckload of DLCs to compensate for the lack of content. And even those will probably end up being overpriced as well. =\  10.) Fair Enough, but I'm not expecting much without DLC at this point. >_>  11.) Fair Enough.  12.) It'll be an even worse day for people who got suckered into pre-ordering this game on the 17th, I can almost promise you that. I can already see a Disasterous Launch for this game just waiting to happen. Prove me wrong, DICE. I fucking dare you.  13.) Fair Enough, but it still baffles me that people still fall for this kinda crap in the year 2015. Especially since you can get all that shit in game for free already.  14.) Uh......wasn't this made public knowledge right from the start? O_o   Overall, though. Nothing really major to be known from these answers, for the most part."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,ImJohnsirz,9,Sun Jul 19 02:01:21 2015 UTC,"I believe I read one of the devs' comments that said that there will be plenty of indoor close quarter maps in Battlefront. I'm thinking maybe the base on Endor, Echo Base, Mos Eisley (which is confirmed pretty much) and others will be in the game."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,greenlittleapple,2,Sun Jul 19 02:35:29 2015 UTC,There is a Hoth cave map which I assume will be close quarters throughout most of it.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,MotherfuckingMoose,5,Sun Jul 19 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"Most maps will cater to you.   It's the people who want larger maps that would have to hope for at least one, but with 40 player cap it won't be happening."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,middleground11,4,Sun Jul 19 03:59:56 2015 UTC,Metro is easily one of the worst maps DICE has cooked up so I hope they're nothing like that. The maps from the Close Quarters dlc for BF3 were much better if you're into that sort of thing.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,Hayt89,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:42:29 2015 UTC,Metro is Bae. But the cqb maps were also great. 925 was big enough for 12 v 12
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,ImTheReal_TuongLuKim,10,Tue Jul 21 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"operation metro, while fun sometimes with 16v16 Rush, is one of the worst maps ever in a FPS IMO. you can't flank at all, not even in metro 2014. everything is a choke point."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,TheSceneYouHate,3,Sun Jul 19 02:02:43 2015 UTC,This is true. I loved it when you managed to somehow sneak through and start capturing an objective behind them and they rush back trying to recap it and it helps your team break through. Good times.  Edit:spelling
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,Shitpoe_Sterr,2,Sun Jul 19 02:07:36 2015 UTC,Thats not what makes a good map though...  Didn't understand how DICE could make such a retarded map twice
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,c92094,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really like it either, but obviously there's a demand for it.  So I kinda get why they'd do it."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,Shitpoe_Sterr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:24 2015 UTC,Demand for a shitty corridor map with no flanking options? Who the fuck wants that?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,c92094,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:22:21 2015 UTC,Everyone who constantly fills up the 24/7 metro servers on the last two games...
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,Blackice200,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know... Bespin platforms rings a bell.. That map was mainly just a giant choke point. I mean yeah, you had the occasional fighter land on one of the landing pads and capture a point, but that map was still very linear. And hey, it's one of the most beloved maps from the battlefront series."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,kfm946,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"I would love to see CQ maps, especially since there's a maximum of 40 players. 64p on Metro is disgusting, but with a lower player count it really works well, as did most of the maps in SWBF2 (which were relatively small)."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,zdenek117,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:08:25 2015 UTC,I hope they will make Domination mode in Battlefront. I like to play few rounds when I have less time. Especially on Paracel Storm and GoldmundRailway.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,Hayt89,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:57:19 2015 UTC,I have a sneaking suspicion that Supremacy (which a lot of people assume will be Conquest mode) will actually be Domination-like
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,SumB1tchRaptor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"You mentioned Metro, so you get downvoted. Typical.  I think they've confirmed at least 1 CQB map inside Echo Base. I think the formula for the game is 1 large, 1 medium, and 1 small map per planet.  And no, I love Operation Metro's Rush. Having a similar experience in Battlefront would be amazing."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,MotherfuckingMoose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:48:41 2015 UTC,"I wonder what CQ is like with heroes? I mean it's one things going up against a guy with similar armaments as you, but what about a guy who can deflect your shots, run fast, force choke/push you? Makes me feel like I'd take shots at Vader when he's not focusing on me and then running when he comes towards me when I've pissed him off."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,Lord_NiteShade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:18:09 2015 UTC,You are forgetting the Fighter Squadron mode which will probably have at least 1 map per planet specially made for it. So most likely 1 small-medium sized map and 1 medium-large size map for each planet.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,SumB1tchRaptor,2,Sun Jul 19 15:29:58 2015 UTC,Because metro has an atrocious design that's 99% chokepoint
StarWarsBattlefront,3dsnyp,MakinDessert,4,Sun Jul 19 04:21:05 2015 UTC,The choke points only become a problem on 64 man Conquest fuckfests.  16v16 Rush on it is balanced and really fun.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,ImTheReal_TuongLuKim,10,Sun Jul 19 21:55:29 2015 UTC,How do you compare swbf to fallout? totally different genre haha
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,xtotheh,27,Mon Jul 20 06:13:12 2015 UTC,I think the game looks great.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Koraik,22,Sun Jul 19 21:59:30 2015 UTC,I think you're on the wrong sub. You should be in /r/battlefront.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,kfm946,12,Sun Jul 19 22:02:12 2015 UTC,shhhhhh!!!!!! they'll come back again!
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Bluenite0100,9,Sun Jul 19 22:08:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, bye, I guess? I think the game looks awesome."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,0lle,5,Sun Jul 19 22:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this OP, I was pretty amazed by the graphics at first but this subreddit is blinded by it. The gameplay just looks like it has 0 depth and is lackluster as hell but we'll have to wait till it comes out to make the final judgment."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,dangitalvin,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"well...welcome to modern gaming i guess? games are spewed out shotgun style and rebooted every 4-5 years, whatever sticks gets a better version made. frankly if there wasn't a new star wars movie being made this game wouldn't get any traction amongst the younger crowd. Atleast this way i have hope the next one gets dlc with all the modes back..."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,suicidalfitnessfreak,6,Tue Jul 21 12:48:23 2015 UTC,"What ships can we fly?   We have seen 2 game modes.  There are 3 ships already in Walker Assault (Snowspeeder, TIE Fighter, X-Wing)."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,butchthedoggy,-11,Mon Jul 20 02:52:06 2015 UTC,WOW 3 SHIPS. Snow speeders dont count.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Calap,8,Mon Jul 20 07:42:08 2015 UTC,"Snowspeeder doesn't count?  Yes it does, the fuck are you on about.  You'll be able to pilot the falcon as well, and you're daft if you think there aren't more."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Gamefreak975,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:52:12 2015 UTC,"Falcon, sure, but thats Rebel only. So far we have 3 / 4 confirmed ships on the Rebel side.  What Imperial equivalent could match the Falcon?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,xaliber_skyrim,4,Mon Jul 20 12:25:15 2015 UTC,Vader's TIE Advanced or Soontir Fel's red-striped TIE Interceptor? Not as iconic as Falcon but I think it'd be cool.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Gamefreak975,2,Mon Jul 20 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be really excited to see either of those. Is Soontir Fel ""canon"" still? I know he was recently put into the X-wing miniatures game through the Imperial Ace pack, but I'm not sure on his overall status"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,xaliber_skyrim,2,Mon Jul 20 13:40:07 2015 UTC,Not sure if Fel is still canon but I'm really hoping he is. Wookieepedia classifies him as SW Legends though. :/ http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Soontir_Fel
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Robertx,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:12 2015 UTC,Maybe this? http://i.imgur.com/CSnAT77.jpg
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Gamefreak975,2,Mon Jul 20 13:16:22 2015 UTC,"We can only hope. Though the Lambda shuttle is used primarily as a transport or light utility escort in the movies, and I don't think DICE is looking to shake it up too much in that regard."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Calap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:41:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure.  Maybe Vader's TIE.  I guess we'll just have to wait.  My last comment makes it seem like I have a lot of confidence in the game, but I certainly have a healthy amount of worry that DICE is going to fudge this up."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Calap,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:13:31 2015 UTC,Hey guess what. Y wings? No. a wings? Probably not. B wings? Most likely not. full control of the AT-AT?  PROBABLY NOT. WHAT ABOUT TAUNTAUNS?  NOPE.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Glenleft,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:35 2015 UTC,Aw man those tauntauns.  RIP DICE.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,WantedtoPostThis,-2,Mon Jul 20 09:40:57 2015 UTC,I just realized how bad this game will be if this is what we are getting.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,WantedtoPostThis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:05 2015 UTC,....how do snow speeders not count?  that's like saying jeeps in BF4 don't count as land vehicles because they aren't tanks
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,WantedtoPostThis,4,Tue Jul 21 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"I share a similar sentiment with the jetpacks bit. I like the feature, but worry it will be overused.  There could be like a supply rack that has them around the maps, like a in battle pick up."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,budgie88,0,Mon Jul 20 17:30:38 2015 UTC,Or crashed escape pods.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,N0r3m0rse,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:09 2015 UTC,I don't follow...What do you mean by crashed escape pods?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,budgie88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:57 2015 UTC,Crashed escape pods full of jet packs
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,N0r3m0rse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:01 2015 UTC,Oh that's cool too :)   Mind if I add that in a post I'm making right now concerning jetpacks?
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,budgie88,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"Go ahead , all yours!"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Txbored,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks :]!!"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,SumB1tchRaptor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"supply drops would make more sense then escape pods but great idea, jet packs were power ups back in the 90s games this new battlefront seems to be channeling so why make the weapons pick ups but the power ups usual gear?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,SHdude,2,Tue Jul 21 01:55:26 2015 UTC,"Why change something that attracted a large audience and change it. look what rockstar did. Everyone loved car tuning in SA. it was absent in gta iv. Community complained and now here we are with the biggest GTA ever.  Sure dice, reboot the series but change the name."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,K3lroy,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"A big issue for this game is that it's not class based anymore, but personal loadout based, which means it's not going to play at all like old battlefront, it'll have a noticeable random element."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Bendit_1942,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"not necessarily random, i guarantee there will be A LOT of jet packing about."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,sleepyslim,2,Tue Jul 21 01:56:22 2015 UTC,"You will have no way of knowing what gear a player has, let alone what they have unlocked to begin with when the match starts."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,phantom1942,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"what i mean is this, you spawn on a buddy, and the buddy shares his ""star cards"" (cringes) with you, if he had a high level jet pack unlock you now have it. if half the team has the best weapons then the other half could get access to it. so that randomness is sort of buffered by the fact you can swap about stuff you have between you and your buddy."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Neon_42,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:53 2015 UTC,"Absolutely wrong. Dark Forces takes place before,during, and a little after A New hope."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Gamefreak975,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"I really don't know what I was thinking. I just got done playing Jedi Outcast, so perhaps that's what happened. Trust me, I'm not that clueless lol."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,WerTicusness,3,Sun Jul 19 22:50:16 2015 UTC,And to think that people were worried it'd be too similar to Battlefield before E3...
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,legobmw99,2,Mon Jul 20 00:02:12 2015 UTC,"Upvoting because you have some good points, but you should still reconsider how you say it.  I did really look forward to piloting vehicles, especially the AT AT and AT ST, or the Droideka as mentioned. But hey, it does still look somewhat promising. It probably won't be a bad game, but it definitely won't be like the old SWBF games that's for sure.."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,phantom1942,4,Mon Jul 20 09:38:39 2015 UTC,"I am afraid I have to agree with OP, although I have a strong Battlefield bias.  The inclusion of jetpacks I find especially jarring. Wasn't it supposed to be true to the original trilogy? As someone who grew up with them, it seems ridiculous that anyone but Boba has one."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,zenary,4,Tue Jul 21 08:48:01 2015 UTC,"To me they're more like jump packs. You can't hover with them. I imagine Boba will be able to hover, setting him apart from the soldiers."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Germanhammer05,2,Mon Jul 20 03:48:45 2015 UTC,I'm with OP on basically everything.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,-copperhead-,3,Mon Jul 20 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"You've got some good points but everyone here will downvote you for having a salty attitude. You're right about the immersion aspects. Jet packs were never seen the original trilogy, nor those bubble shields. They have nixed most of the piloted vehicles, y-wings won't be pilotable for example. I don't think this is a reskinned game, though all fps are about the same so it is hard to tell. It would be nice if EA and DICE were more open with us. I wonder where my sandbox battles went from BF1 and BF2. I'm looking at you /u/Sledgehammer70 and /u/DICE_TheBikingViking."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,budgie88,2,Mon Jul 20 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"""When I am able to reveal more information, I most certainly will"""
StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,MC_Fillius_Dickinson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:44 2015 UTC,bf3 was the perfect game? REALLLLLLY?

StarWarsBattlefront,3dvjye,Shift9303,-12,Mon Jul 20 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"It looks good yeah sure. But where is the immersion? What makes this game worth 60 bucks? What does it offer?  It's arcadey. Content is lacking. I'm trying so hard to see the positIves of this game because I grew up with Battlefield and I'm very bias with Dice. But this. What the fuck is this?  The main thing that really bothers me is How much content THEY CAN ADD. well , the clone wars was 25 years ago in the game universe.  The lack of weapons is just sad. Yet they have like 20 possible weapons to bring in from the clone wars. Which would have been good and cool. But I've seen 6 different weapons.  Walker assault.  That's dumb. no walkers in conquest?  Well wtf. Limited walker  movement? No class customization. You can't put your own mark on your trooper. That's also dumb.  I want to stand out. I want to be in green camouflage if I'm imperial.  There is so much more room for improvement. But god.  You know what made battlefront battlefront? BEING ABLE TO RE LIVE THE BATTLES YOU SAW ON SCREEN. THE WAY YOU WANT. That's what made battlefront so good. No restrictons. It appealed to both fans. New and old. We got to fly x wings, pilot walkers, Board Capitol ships, Fly around walkers with snow speeders.  That is what made battlefront.  What does this rendition of Battlefront offer? Besides looking good?.  Can you answer that. Can anyone tell me this will be better than the last battlefront without trolling? . Probably not."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,Scravey,8,Sat Jul 18 00:12:41 2015 UTC,The Jedi Knight series is perfect and deserves a new game.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,Dangerman909,10,Sat Jul 18 02:31:48 2015 UTC,"Fully agree. Outcast was one of the absolute best star wars games, and had the best lightsaber combat I've ever seen. Sadly probably will never happen due to the EU being wiped out."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,huntimir151,3,Sat Jul 18 04:07:45 2015 UTC,"while I played a ton of jedi outcast back in the day, I think the bset star wars game goes to knights of the old republic. I wish they would have scraped all 3 prequels and made a movie from KOTOR's story"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,fetalbeej,4,Sat Jul 18 21:40:17 2015 UTC,"Hence the qualifier ""one of"". Kotor and it's sequel are imo the best star wars games of all time."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,huntimir151,2,Sat Jul 18 21:55:10 2015 UTC,"ah did not see the ""one of"". in that case I do agree. I'll never forget picking up jedi outcast randomly at wal-mart one day and ended up playing multiplayer all summer long."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,fetalbeej,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:52 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with a good ol' reboot
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,Gamefreak975,3,Sat Jul 18 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"While we know it's basically an upperhand and underhand system, JKA would be PERFECT for this game. The only problem would be the really high jump height. They need to look at the JK games for tips on how to make the lightsaber be fun to use and have some depth."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,killmachine91,2,Sat Jul 18 01:26:27 2015 UTC,"That would be amazing! I loved the way The Jedi Knight series treated lightsabers, unlike games like The Force Unleashed where attacking a Stormtrooper with lightsabers became the Star Wars equivalent of Shaun of The Dead attacking zombies with a cricket bat."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,MuchosCarpinchos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:02:49 2015 UTC,It was fun though!
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,Seravie,3,Sun Jul 19 06:15:13 2015 UTC,"This is gameplay with a mod for the animations and maybe a few other bits. It was also singleplayer.  BaseJKA looked more like this for saber dueling. Full force duels were pretty much just grip kick, pull kick and saber staff throwing/swinging. Like this.  EDIT:As a note to the people who never played the game. The reason why everyone in the videos is either Jan or Kyle(for the most part) is because custom player models(that you did not have downloaded) would show up as Jan or Kyle based on your chosen gender(chosen via the command ""/Sex (m or f)"")  And in general Singleplayer and Multiplayer Saber/Force systems had some pretty big variation. That Grip Kick and Pull kick stuff wasn't possible in singleplayer for instance."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,Morrenz,3,Sat Jul 18 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"I know it was a mod, I should have mentioned it in the original post. I just chose that clip because it shows some very nice lightsaber on lightsaber hit effects and had more recognizable characters."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,Morrenz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:10:02 2015 UTC,"It's fine. I mean the closest I could find was JA+ anyway, so I'm not a whole lot closer to base. Base pretty much doesn't exist anymore anyway. Hasn't for a good 10 years."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,WerTicusness,3,Sat Jul 18 04:24:25 2015 UTC,Yeah and what if the fighters had the flight mechanics of xwing vs tie fighter?  Obviously it would be a 10x better game that it is going to be... But you can blame EA corporate for making sure it is dumbed down to  'extra retard'.  I bet light sabre duels are a quick time event.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,XeroAnarian,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"I loved Jedi Academy multiplayer...  Until I found out there's stupid techniques like ""fanning"" that severely limit lightsaber dueling variety."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dooim,Galak_Fyyar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:57:09 2015 UTC,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movement-linked saber combat in these games, although I mostly played single player. I would at least like to see limb dismemberment for killing blows, so a lightsaber would act like a blade of plasma rather than a baseball bat. /u/Sledgehammer70 , any chance of adding lightsaber dismemberment to this game?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,OsoDEADLY,16,Fri Jul 17 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"Carrier Assault was based off one of the most popular game modes in Battlefield 2142 -- Titan Mode. Originally, two teams had ""Titans,"" which were essentially flying aircraft carriers with shields   (seen here:http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130827184800/battlefieldfanfiction/images/e/ee/Titan_Mode.jpg).   Your objective was to destroy the shield, board the Titan, plant explosives on the power core, and escape before it was destroyed. The objectives on the ground contained silos which fired missiles at the enemy Titan damaging the shield. After enough damage was taken, the shield would be destroyed, aircraft could land on it, and infantry units could begin their attack.  I would love to see something like this in Battlefront. It could work the same way, and it would be phenomenal."
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,TheNameIsFrags,2,Sat Jul 18 00:01:41 2015 UTC,"I seriously want this as I'm (still) a big fan of 2142, but i'm afraid we won't see it in the game due to the fact we already don't have 64 players and limitations i guess. 40 players is too few to have a decent titan battle (ground vs ground + titan def vs titan attack + ..)"
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,Driezzz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:04:35 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately :( I feel that DICE is trying too hard to distinguish Battlefront from Battlefield, and that's not always a good thing. The option of 64 players and five man squads would be great features to implement, but they're not included because it's ""too similar"" to Battlefield."
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,TheNameIsFrags,5,Sat Jul 18 23:36:11 2015 UTC,"I would love this mode, and many of us here have and would agree that it should be, and would fit nicely, in Star Wars Battlefront."
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,MakinDessert,3,Sat Jul 18 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"I doubt that any of the announced modes (Walker Assault, Blast, Cargo, Supremacy and Fighter Squadron) fit this but they did say ""and more"". I doubt they'd hold but such an appealing mode though"
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,Hayt89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:31:02 2015 UTC,They did for bf4 right until naval strike came out.
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,flipett,3,Sat Jul 18 07:20:27 2015 UTC,"I hope so. A Carrier Assault/Titan mode would suit Battlefront way more than BF4. I just have that real bad feeling that while this game is likely to be good, it's gonna be frustratingly missing so many opportunities."
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,UberGoat,6,Sat Jul 18 15:01:53 2015 UTC,"""It's not authentic... or something""- DICE"
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,pabbus,3,Fri Jul 17 23:54:15 2015 UTC,"But given that Disney has shot the EU to hell, I don't think that's an excuse anymore."
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,Akashd98,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:44:18 2015 UTC,Ha! If they give that excuse I'll lose all faith. I'm pretty sure TIE fighters on Hoth weren't authentic either... but everyone likes it!
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,aj_thenoob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:51:23 2015 UTC,They have star destroyers in low orbit on hoth.  They are too large to go low orbit. And the ones at Hoth were stuck at a distance by the nipple cannon
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,Lord_NiteShade,2,Sun Jul 19 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see that, but there's a good chance DICE would see modes like this, conquest and dismountable vehicles as factors that would compete with the Battlefield series. If I'm wrong and things like this eventually get added, I might buy the game sometime down the track."
StarWarsBattlefront,3doilz,Galak_Fyyar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:02:21 2015 UTC,"I have a funny feeling it could be DLC. Not being negative or anything, but they could have included Carrier Assault in BF4's release and hailed it as the return of Titan Mode, but instead they saved that for an expansion pack later on down the line."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,Thotaz,3,Sat Jul 18 09:24:52 2015 UTC,"While yes bf4 has too much stuff at the same time its far from killed by the different dev team, and tbh DICELA may have actually saved the game, its 2ys old and has more players than hardline and is arguably a better game then most modern fps"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,Bluenite0100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understood the issue I had with Dice LA (and TBH the point of the topic wasn't really to discuss BF4, it was just a perfect example of what I was talking about).  My problem with what Dice LA is doing to BF4 is that they are changing it too much. Fixing issues and adding more customization for the HUD is all great, but changing the entire gunplay, air vehicle physics, and vehicle balancing to the extent that they are doing it is just too much for a simple game update.  Some people may like the changes, but these people clearly didn't have a big problem with the way the game played before, otherwise they wouldn't be playing it. But for the people who don't like these changes it may be enough to stop them from playing the game, and a game update should never do that. These people bought the game expecting a certain type of gameplay, and changing it so much screws these people over. I think the big changes Dice LA have made have slowly made the game less fun for me, and when the summer patch gets released with the current CTE changes then I'm finally done. If I know Dice LA or some other random team is going to take over Battlefront and totally change the game away from what I liked then why should I bother buying it or any of the expansion packs/season pass?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,MichaelColtaine,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:12:23 2015 UTC,I agree with you to some extent. I dislike those tracers and the head glitch fix feels awkward.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,Bluenite0100,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:41:26 2015 UTC,"They removed the 313 speed control element, and made it so more speed= faster turning. On top of this they changed the way that gravity affects the airplane so you can barely accelerate while climbing, and you can barely decelerate while descending.  People complained too much about this, so they decided to postpone it, but they ""forgot"" to remove it from the attack jet in the most recent update, so currently the attack jet has this stupid system, but the stealth jet hasn't been affected by it, yet. Oh and on top of this they made a huge nerf on the attack jet damage output, but that's not really air physics related."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,Hayt89,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"Have you even played CTE lately? All the things people complained about in the spring patch are now fixed (except maybe jet physics). Netcode is about as good as it can get, stuff like the reload bug is fixed, flashbangs are much better, tracers are toned down. We're getting Zavod night, plus probably high tick servers. How is there anything to complain about? Just because it's not ""the same as it was before"" doesn't mean it's awful and ruins the game."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,Driezzz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty clear that my complaints is something that have accumulated over a long period of time, it's not just the latest patch, it's all of them since the CTE that have minor and major changes that I didn't like (they've also had a lot of changes I'm neutral, or happy about, but these changes aren't really gameplay related).  The gun balancing is still (more or less) the same after their huge makeover, the air vehicle balance is still the same after the makeover.   The current CTE release doesn't fix those issues, instead it adds yet another problem: Vehicle sensitivity: https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield_4_CTE/comments/3dnve0/turret_changes_explained/  If you like these changes, then that's great, but I think it's wrong for the game to change so much when I purchased the game based on the gameplay I had seen and had tried myself. If you didn't like the original game, then it's your own fault for buying it, but I had no chance of knowing that Dice LA would try to change the game into something else."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,dieter0_07,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:51:58 2015 UTC,"Gun balance is nearly perfect (except shotguns) now. Before, high RoF weapons were clearly superior to low RoF, and half the weapons were utterly pointless. Now almost every weapon is viable, and I've been able to pick just about any weapon and do pretty well with it. Maybe it's just that the ways we play and our ideas of a good game are very different, but I personally can't think of many things at all that DICE LA did that really had a negative effect."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,klusps,2,Sat Jul 18 17:01:20 2015 UTC,"DICE LA are absolutely doing the dlc. Back when it was a common misconception that DICE LA was developing the game I'd link this article.

""Imagine stuff like potential expansion packs and premium services being managed and handled out of LA."" http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-being-made-by-dice-stockholm-not-la/1100-6410259/"

Battle of Jaku will be a free dlc in december. But for the rest, we don't know if they're going for an agressive dlc plan like with BF3/4/H.   Premium hasn't been annouced yet, but I guess we won't see it in this game as they want a very wide playerbase and premium might frighten them.  Food for thought eh?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dq0y2,WerTicusness,2,Sat Jul 18 09:32:31 2015 UTC,Premium wont fright them. It will be there.

Reaching two generations back is definitely wishful thinking, but I'm with ya on that one. Hopefully this may provide a competition driven action by Sony"

StarWarsBattlefront,3do3nj,Confusedandlost123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:55:28 2015 UTC,"not happening  backwards compatibility on the One is via an emulation Shell for each game individually.  It's similar to playing a PC game on Mac or Linux via Wine  backwards compatibility will be on a per-game basis. If you have a digital copy, you simply download the game and it's wrapper on the One, if you have a disc, it doesn't play off the disc, it triggers the download of the game and it's wrapper, but will require the disk as a key to play it.  so for each game they include a stripped down version of the 360 OS that is made specifically for that game, it's not like the Wii U and the Wii virtual console where it has an entire extra OS on the console."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dnunl,PaperNoire,5,Fri Jul 17 20:11:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I wondered if there was explanation for it. That's pretty cool. Looking back I see they're not all German, the pistol looks like a welrod and the rocket launcher like a recoilless rifle. If I could ask another question, do the guns in starwars use actual individual rounds? I always assumed the magazine was like a power pack and the lasers were generated by the gun. I've noticed they never reload once in the video, but is there canon use for the charging bolts?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dnunl,Germanhammer05,4,Fri Jul 17 20:27:23 2015 UTC,"yeah they use recharging packs, if I recall correctly each one held a charge that was worth about 500 rounds."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dnunl,Unnamed_5oldier,3,Fri Jul 17 20:39:35 2015 UTC,The charge is technically a reload. But instead of seeing a hand reload animation you see a bar cool down

Honestly it looks a little bit goofy that you can see all these parts and sections obviously designed for mechanical fire in the laser guns. Some of the conversions are better than others."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dnunl,awesomeguy951,3,Fri Jul 17 22:15:19 2015 UTC,I can't tell the difference either. It's also important to note that the props were actual functioning firearms that fired actual bullets.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dnunl,killmachine91,2,Fri Jul 17 23:49:10 2015 UTC,It also helped to time the blaster shot effect plus it gives us the classic star wars smoke effect too.

Like the a280/95 has a charging bolt on the side for an either non-existent or non-functional loading mechanism. The dlt 19 has a huge feeding block and belt cover. Not to mention all the flash supressors when there'd be no flash from no gas explosion, and the ""round"" itself is already a giant bright light. It's like I'm glad they've kept this tribute to the original low-cost solutions for the movies, but I also wonder if it'd been worth stylizing them a bit more."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dnunl,FlyingAce1015,0,Fri Jul 17 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, those are small details they probably didn't consider back them because no one though people cared about the most minute parts of the guns.

Because he's telling people what to do with the money they earned, and reddit doesn't like that. I won't be preordering this game based on Dice's past of sketchy day 1 releases, but there are games from other developers I will preorder (asasuming a bonus of some content is attached to it) so I can get it pre-loaded because I trust them.  I could be wrong, but I don't think the console crowd understands the correlation between preordering a preloading that us pc gamers enjoy and like to take advantage of. It's a bit different when  you have to download a 50gb+ game on the same day EVERYONE ELSE is trying to. Impatient? Sure, but can you blame us when we get trailers, screenshots, etc jammed down our throats?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dg5xi,Lmaolikeacow,5,Thu Jul 16 13:11:29 2015 UTC,But he's not holding a gun to there head.  He's simply telling them don't pre-order because those that do generally are ones who complain seven the game ships broken

During E3, Amazon.ca runs a deal where if you preorder 3 or more games, you get 30% off each. With the low price guarantee and other discounts they put on games every once in a while, I'm looking at closer to 40% off of a lot of games. It makes more sense for me to preorder and only spend $50-55 on a game instead of close to $90. Plus, Amazon lets you cancel the games individually if you change your mind."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,Nemarus,65,Wed Jul 15 21:37:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't take such specifics regarding vehicles in Battlefront as part of the Star Wars lore. I mean they had to give TIE Fighters equipment which is as strong as the one of its counterpart which is the X-Wing otherwise it would be unbalanced as f***. It is probably just a gameplay decision and I am pretty sure that the TIEs in the movies will be the normal ones without any missiles (though there will probably also be other TIE variants like the bomber or something new which can fire missiles)
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,kruziik,6,Wed Jul 15 21:43:46 2015 UTC,"Lol I remember in SWBF 1 they gave the X-Wings highly powerful blasters and torpedoes and they could wipe the sky with the TIEs, but they also gave all the weapons to the TIE bomber"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,me2224,5,Thu Jul 16 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"The EU's later books also established that the ""Empire"" never actually died out, it ended up becoming the Imperial Remnant and at least partly allied with the New Republic.   I don't know if the books actually showed the Remnant reversing the attitudes about not caring about individual pilot/soldiers (and thus TIEs becoming better armed/shielded), but it wouldn't surprise me.  As for the movies, who knows?  Emperor's been dead a long time, something similar could happen (that they care about their pilots, not allying with the new republic), especially if the new movies confirm cloning is no longer viable and they have to actually recruit soldiers (I have not read any of the new books, so of the new canon I literally only know the movies, and AFAIK episodes IV-VI don't specifically state that cloning is no longer done)."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,middleground11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:58:20 2015 UTC,"even in the old canon, storm troopers were still mostly clones, just with a wider variety of templates, though they did take recruits."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,DelucaFTW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:27 2015 UTC,That too. But I felt like that was too obvious a reason. I'm talking canonical reasons of why that should be allowed (especially in a game where EA is saying they're paying close attention to detail).
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,sylinmino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:51 2015 UTC,Fair enough - I generally believe game balance should come before canonical reasons though.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,WardenHDresden,6,Thu Jul 16 18:55:00 2015 UTC,This isn't the first game to have them.  As some mentioned they had them in Battlefront 2  Also the old TIE Fighter game from the 90s had some missions where you flew a Regular ol' TIE with missiles IIRC.  I think there may have also been a mission in X-Wing Alliance where enemy ties had missiles.

Quite a bit of new material has been using EU stuff. The Tarkin book for example brings back the Interdiction SD. It mentions a droid from Darth Plagueis' book (Tarkin was written by the same author)  The Ultimate Star Wars book brought back a lot of EU home planets for characters.  Really the only things they can't use are story lines.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,nreisan,2,Thu Jul 16 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"Battlefront 2 had TIE's with missiles. Tie Fighter had TIE's with missiles. The Books had the same as well.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfj4x,MsgGodzilla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:22:07 2015 UTC,"Battlefront isn't canon in any way that actually matters.

A good example is the Star Wars mod for Battlefield 1942.  I get why DICE makes these decisions (most people don't know what canon tech actually is, and would be annoyed if it wasn't perfectly balanced which is hard to do), but I do so wish my imaginary Star Wars game could be made."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,JediGuyB,19,Thu Jul 16 03:21:36 2015 UTC,A lot of the choices are super baffling in ways that not even the most outrageously negative people could have predicted.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,Hayt89,20,Thu Jul 16 03:26:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Some of the stuff I can understand, but other stuff I see and just wonder why. Like why have vehicles be power ups? Why use cards? Why not have a real Instant Action mode?   I get that the cards are basically just weapons and special items, but then why make them cards? Why not just let us choose a weapon/item load-out? It would be the exact same thing. Why make them cards? It's not that big a deal, but it still feels out of place.  With how much they love to tell us about immersion, authentication, and all that they sure seem to have made some really odd choices that go against those claims."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,JediGuyB,8,Thu Jul 16 03:35:15 2015 UTC,I'm being cynical but it's probably cards because you have to get them out of random booster packs like the battlepacks in BF4

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,uberJames,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:04:03 2015 UTC,"I think that since its barely in alpha, they'll change it up a lot.   The UI looks like shit, and the cards are retarded. They'll probably fix it before launch to something smoother.   BF4 did a lot of fixing before launch as well."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,flipett,8,Thu Jul 16 08:14:49 2015 UTC,"It is not barely in alpha. The game is coming out on the 17th of November. Unless they're pushing it back like hardline, it is not going to change that much. It is only 4 months away. Game design and development is not a quick process. This has been in the works for ages, Alpha would of been 2 years ago."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,MattDeee,3,Thu Jul 16 08:59:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I saw at E3 it said Pre Alpha footage.   And UI probably isn't as intensive as graphic changes."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,Hayt89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"I never said they will. But if there was extensive changes needed similar to hardline, then yes they would delay it."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,MattDeee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:29:23 2015 UTC,UI changes as well as changing power ups to actual vehicles should be doable without a problem in 4 months. I've seen DICE do bigger changes even faster in just weeks in Battlefield 4 CTE. Changing flight mechanics should also be no problem as they've already got the back end in Frostbite due to Battlefield. And if they handle it like Battlefield we should expect the game to be patched and update with new content for 1-2 years after release.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,ACatWithThumbs,0,Thu Jul 16 22:25:09 2015 UTC,So if they handled it like Battlefield it would be broken for 6 months-12 months? Because that is what BF3 and BF4 were on launch.

I think they'll expire on use, you'll need to buy them using XP instead of earning them randomly, they provide perks and buffs.  It'll be interesting to see how the sharing thing works."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,EliteDangerous,2,Thu Jul 16 21:38:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they said they don't expire on use.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,MakinDessert,2,Fri Jul 17 01:31:44 2015 UTC,"There were customization options in a few other battlefront games, right? But damn, this game seems super disappointing."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,JollyWhiskerThe4th,4,Thu Jul 16 02:50:52 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by customization.  You had classes, and each class had its own look and weapons, and with the possibility of mods customization was that much diverse (still within classes)  With the new Battlefront it seems like all soldiers will at a fundamental level all look the same (with the exception of a couple of aliens) but you'll be able to change some things within the character itself (unlike an entirely new class).  But one wonders too what's the limit of customization since DICE themselves said many times that they don't want pink storm troopers, so color change seems out of the question, and they (presumably) don't want to change the soldiers themselves that much (I mean, battlefront is supposed to be about playing the soldiers in star wars, not something else)  So even though this new Battlefront offers individual customization, it doesn't seem it will offer much more options that classes used to provide in the previous games"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,Hayt89,5,Thu Jul 16 05:58:54 2015 UTC,"The customisation also means that you can't learn to spot people and know the capabilities of the class. No more ""get their medic"" or ""take out that sniper"" seeing as antitank weapons or any other equipment save for jetpacks arent physically shown on the soldier until they pull them out of their magical pocket."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,Gamefreak975,8,Thu Jul 16 10:31:48 2015 UTC,"It seems funny to me that when Halo 3 came out everyone was like ""ZOMG THE FUTURE ALL GUNS WILL BE ON YOUR CHARACTER"" and now we're straight back to fucking Doom levels of ""realism"" in 2015.  Is that a Heat-Seeking HH-15 Projectile Launcher in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,Hayt89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:27:29 2015 UTC,I mean what we know sucks but there could be more. I am a pretty harsh critic at the moment but it's because DICE stubbornly refuses to give us any hint of the big picture leaving us with bizarre systems without the context that (presumably) justifies them.

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,cartermatic,8,Thu Jul 16 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"To some people, this helps to reduce camping.  Bad Company 2 didn't have prone and it didn't seem to affect the game that much."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,Gamefreak975,4,Thu Jul 16 14:22:03 2015 UTC,"Campers are going to camp no matter what. Prone is cool, and probably should've been included. Same with vaulting animations.  I know they were going for the arcadey feel of the older Battlefronts, but troops spazzing up and down in order to jump out of trenches is not what I want to see in this day and age."

StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,Galak_Fyyar,3,Thu Jul 16 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"Mhmm. I can somewhat understand not having the evasive roll since it doesn't seem to be very prevalent in other shooters, but no prone? That was one of the things I wished Battlefront 2 had. From what I've seen so far, I'm wondering if their decision process went something along the lines of ""these games did this, so let's make sure our game doesn't so it will look 'unique'"". I hate sounding like a pessimistic brat, but that's the first thing that comes to mind when I consider no secondary weapon, so far no flexible vehicular activity, no prone, ""buddy system"" instead of Battlefield's squads, etc.  On that note, I think it's interesting that I still hear concerns regarding Battlefront looking too much like Battlefield, when making it act more like Battlefield would actually do a better job of attracting former Battlefront players like myself. It would seem that some people have forgotten just how similar the older Battlefront and Battlefield games were to one another."
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,league359,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:35 2015 UTC,I know that feel. I'm already extremely doubtful about buying it.
StarWarsBattlefront,3dfy1y,uberJames,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:09:50 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer not having prone; I loved that Bad Company 2 didn't have it because people couldn't go prone in the bushes or on top of a stairwell. I think not including prone is acceptable for more arcade-y shooters anyway, and I therefore wasn't expecting it to be in Battlefront."

I have a Retina Macbook Pro that I love but can't play really anything outside of like Hearthstone.   Battlefront is going to be a fairly graphically demanding game. There are people with gaming PC's who are going to have a hard time running it. Honestly if I were you I'd look into getting it on a console and playing it or get a gaming PC. Both can be had for around the same price-point."
