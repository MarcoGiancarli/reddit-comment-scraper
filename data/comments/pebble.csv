pebble,3e3p7c,CreamyHunterViolet,3,Tue Jul 21 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"Do you have a specific product in mind?   Bepple plastic covers are incredibly over-priced. The creators have given plenty of explanations why their little postage stamp-sized bit of plastic is worth $25-35 but to me that is a lot of money for about a quarter ounce of injection molded plastic. Various companies make skins for Pebble. Gadgetwraps, Slickwraps, Skinomi, etc. Some of these are very nice and can offer decent protection for your watch if you are worried it might get damaged. They generally cost around $10 or so which isn't bad price wise and most have pretty good replacement plans/warranties.   Personally I prefer the look of a bare Pebble Time. I have used skins and such in the past and while it is nice to be able to change up the style of my watch they kinda make the watch a bit ""cartoony"" looking for me. If I do use a skin it is usually a clear one to protect the screen (or bezel) or a skin that is a low-key dark color."

I've certainly felt better about it getting dinged (it protected the bezel from a nasty scuff I retained from moving a couch).  I also like the freedom to change up designs or colors. It's like buying different watchstraps, you also have the ability to change the bezel to suit your style.   I know some don't care for them and have had zero issues, but I wouldn't chance my Time without a cover for the screen and bezel. I might be overly cautious though."

pebble,3dy161,FreakyT,33,Mon Jul 20 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"As requested, it now supports the OG Pebble! It also includes the following new features:   Sidebar color text can now be set separately (as suggested by /u/samyall) Optional battery indicator (as suggested by /u/skale89, /u/telijah, /u/AsAnAside, /u/deans6571, /u/calKno and others) Option for display of leading zero (as suggested by /u/onlyburmese and others) Language selection for date display (as suggested by a bunch of people who emailed me)   Check it out! App store link: https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55a5c024f4510f794c000071  (Also, special thanks to my friend for letting me borrow her OG Pebble for testing!)"
pebble,3dy161,AsAnAside,5,Mon Jul 20 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"Noticed the update last night - thanks for adding all this stuff!  Surprised that I could like this watch face even more than before.  I also realized that when using the custom settings you don't need to re-do all the settings every time you want to change anything.  If you just change the specific item you want, even though the others are all x's, it only updates whatever is changed."
pebble,3dy161,poolec4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's by design -- I was hoping that the counter at the top and the ""send to watch"" button would convey that it wouldn't overwrite current settings.  I personally think the way Pebble handles configuration pages is poorly done, since I'd like to be able to easily grab the watch's current configuration, but there's currently no great way to do that, unfortunately."
pebble,3dy161,maxxon,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"You can cache the settings in the phone's local storage using a JS script in the settings page HTML. Here are some snippets from my settings page.  To store:  $(""#b-submit"").click(function() {     ls_pto = JSON.stringify(saveOptions());     if (typeof window.localStorage !== ""undefined"") {       window.localStorage.tutorial = ls_pto;     } }   To retrive:  $().ready(function() {   if (window.localStorage.tutorial) {     ls_pto = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.tutorial);       $(""input[name=key0][id=key0-""+ls_pto[""KEY_0""]+""]"");       ...       $(""input[name=keyn][id=keyn-""+ls_pto[""KEY_n""]+""]"");   } }"

pebble,3dy161,sageDieu,2,Tue Jul 21 11:31:29 2015 UTC,You could put some defaults there.
pebble,3dy161,sageDieu,2,Tue Jul 21 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"True, but then people who already have set things on their watch would then see pre-selected settings that don't match what is on their watch."

pebble,3dy161,neodraig,2,Mon Jul 20 15:03:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all your hard work on this watch face. Been using it since I got my time, and I absolutely love it. Best face I've found, by far.   This might be an over the top suggestion, but is it possible to maybe have the battery indicator hidden unless you shake your wrist? I like how minimal the sidebar looks without the icon, but I also like being able to easily check my battery level.   Thanks again for all your hard work! I also really like your billboard watch face."
pebble,3dy161,dzmarks66,3,Mon Jul 20 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it might be doable, I'll look into adding it.  Awesome, a rare fan of my first watchface! I (finally) released an update to it yesterday that fixes it crashing at midnight, a bug that I only discovered fairly recently."

pebble,3dy161,paulatthehug,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:45 2015 UTC,Talking about the battery indicator...I like the idea of shake to view...add my vote to that. But I also suggest looking into a numerical battery meter. I greatly prefer this for the precision. I can just never really tell what the bar meters are trying to tell me given that they're so small.
pebble,3dy161,paulatthehug,3,Tue Jul 21 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"When I first got my PT, I went through the honeymoon phase of ALL THE FACES! ALL THE APPS!  But, of course, like with any new tech, you narrow down to just what you need and use.  The watchface which spent the longest time on my wrist was N-All-Stars, but that was finally ousted by TimeStyle (I still love you, /u/dezign999 !).  This is a fantastic update. Battery life: added. =)"

Thank you so much for all the work you have put into it!  This has been my watchface since I first saw you post about it on here, and I'm looking forward to trying out all the updates!"
pebble,3dy161,Simoneister,2,Mon Jul 20 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure how it's done in Glance, but is there anyway to also show your phone's battery level? Since you wouldn't want to make it too crowded, is there a way to have a button press toggle between phone and watch battery? Lastly, could we have an option for battery% rather than just the meter? Thanks for a great watchface either way!"
pebble,3dy161,mattbrich,3,Mon Jul 20 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"I believe Glance has a companion app, right? It doesn't look like there's a way for a watchface to get battery information from the phone since PebbleKitJS doesn't seem to support navigator.getBattery().   Lastly, could we have an option for battery% rather than just the meter?   I've had a few people ask for that -- while the text doesn't quite fit with the percent sign, I could probably fit it without the percent sign. Maybe I'll add it as an option."
pebble,3dy161,mattbrich,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:50 2015 UTC,Just wanted to again state my appreciation in your dedication! TimeStyle is my main face now.  I also saw it is featured in the Pebble Store so well done for that!
pebble,3dy161,calKno,2,Mon Jul 20 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"Great watchface! I'm only asking this because you clearly know what you are doing and have a good eye for design.  Is there any chance you'd consider adding a ""text time"" option (eg, four seventeen)?  May not work for this design, but I love me some text time.  Regardless, Nice work!"
pebble,3dy161,m-p-3,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:57 2015 UTC,Can you include an option to have the watchface buzz on the hour every hour?  I wish this would be optional on every face.
pebble,3dy161,justinionn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, that should be in the next release."
pebble,3dy161,mattbrich,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:17 2015 UTC,Just installed on my OG Pebble. Looks and works like a champ! I would prefer a thicker font though.

I don't suppose it'd be possible to make displaying the weather optional? I don't really ever use it and I might as well save a bit of battery."
pebble,3dy161,justinionn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:59:12 2015 UTC,"I could definitely add an option for that -- though, I feel like the sidebar would look like it was missing something. Thoughts?"
pebble,3dy161,sabledrakon,3,Mon Jul 20 14:02:01 2015 UTC,Maybe have an option to replace it with battery indicators?
pebble,3dy161,justinionn,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"Hm. Well, when there's only one thing on display in the Timeline it puts it up the top, so I guess that could be an option. Regardless I personally wouldn't be too fussed about the space."
pebble,3dy161,sabledrakon,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:26 2015 UTC,This is fantastic. Which weather source is used? 30 minute update cycle?
pebble,3dy161,sabledrakon,3,Mon Jul 20 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"OpenWeatherMap, because it's the only one that's free without rate limits!"

What i've noticed it does, which is kinda weird, is when you start the workout it pushes the watchface to Pebble automatically and it remains on your pebble until you close the app. Then it vanishes from the watch menu all together. I never actually install anything. App does everything I ever needed and works with all my sensors.  EDIT: OG pebbler here."
pebble,3e33wt,matthews1977,2,Tue Jul 21 18:52:38 2015 UTC,"If you can spend $200, you should get a Pebble Time.  It's a marked improvement over the original.  Besides the color screen and microphone, there are lots of other improvements to the design.   For instance, the ability to be used with polarized sunglasses I could see being a big advantage to someone who does a lot of cycling."
pebble,3e33wt,Protonus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the mura effect from polarized lenses only affect the OG Pebble, and that both the Steel and Time were unaffected by it. I only have an OG Pebble so I've not tested this, but I can say that as an avid cyclist the mura effect only bothered me at first and I quickly grew accustomed to it."
pebble,3e33wt,TheSwedishOprah,2,Tue Jul 21 20:50:27 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the mura effect from polarized lenses only affect the OG Pebble, and that both the Steel and Time were unaffected by it.   You are correct, however, Mura isn't what I'm talking about.  Instead, you'll find that both the OG Pebble and Steel, also had issues with polarized sunglasses (as do many displays).  Here is an example of both (from the FAQ link in my prior post): https://i.imgur.com/e5Cd74B.jpg  As you can see, the OG Pebble has the Mura, but also is darker, and the Steel is unreadable.  As you rotate the watch relative to your sunglasses, the display would darken.  This is because the displays themselves, were also polarized. For some sunglasses, this could make the watch extremely difficult or impossible to read at common angles.  Pebble Time fixes this by using circular polarization in it's display instead. It's unaffected by polarized sunglasses now."

pebble,3e33wt,PrimaryPineapple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:10 2015 UTC,I've been playing around with different cycling apps. So far my favorite has been Endomundo. Mostly for ease of use and the ability to customize what data is shown on my pebble.  Another perk I've found is that it has an actual app on the pebble. That way if i switch to Music Boss to change songs I can still get back to my ride screen.   I'm sure the original pebble works fine with it.

pebble,3e3u1f,0x8086,7,Tue Jul 21 19:15:24 2015 UTC,"This is easily fixed.  In the Pebble app on your phone, under the Notifications menu, uncheck SMS.  Then instead, check your SMS app(s) of choice, in the All Apps list, also under Notifications.  This will make it work as expected as well as allowing any other Android Wear interactions your SMS app provides.   Do make sure the Android Wear app is still installed, but don't do anything with it, just have it installed.  May need to reboot your phone after, but should be fixed after that.   PS: No need to be melodramatic (a huge pet peeve of any tech support person as they'll be happy to tell you).  Just stick to the facts.

Freeze/Disable, or uninstall, any text message apps other than Hangouts.  Since you're also having issues with Hangouts, may want to consider also disabling hangouts, and using a different app that we know works, like Handcent SMS, Textra, or GO Sms Pro. Reboot. Send/receive some text messages with the app that remains.  Ensure that Android knows it's your default SMS app. Reinstall the Pebble app on your phone.  Enable Notification Access, etc.  Disable SMS in the all apps list.  Check your remaining SMS app in the All Apps list."

pebble,3e0bjy,Qltycntrl,10,Mon Jul 20 23:46:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, it limits the experience if you're 1) used to being able to reply to notifications from your wrist or 2) if you otherwise expect that you should be able to reply to notifications from your smartwatch.  But I've never felt the need to reply to anything from my wrist - I use pebble primarily to receive notifications, not send them, so I've never felt limited.  I also have an apple watch that I used for a couple months before switching to the pebble time, and while it was somewhat cool to reply to texts straight from my watch, in practice I never really used it except for the novelty factor.  So I don't miss it."
pebble,3e0bjy,section23a,4,Tue Jul 21 00:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's kind of my thinking to be honest. I work in film and am often behind a camera and unable to get my phone out, but get an avalanche of emails from the office, so I'm thinking it would be a handy way to quickly check if there was something pressing that I needed to find time to get away from the cam, to my phone to send a response....a high percentage of the time I'm just being copied in for reference. So yeah, on that train of thought I think you're right."
pebble,3e0bjy,madshade,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything said here.  Also, the music app bug is annoying but I have faith that will be worked out."
pebble,3e0bjy,bsmsam,4,Tue Jul 21 14:09:00 2015 UTC,"Having used both the Apple Watch and the PT, I don't think the lack of message replies is a hinderance. Even the AW replies were canned, so unless you were in a room by yourself to speak into your wrist for a reply, it required taking your phone out. That being said, the microphone for text replies on the AW is scarily accurate. I really enjoyed its convenience while driving, but that was the only time I used it.   I just posted about this myself, but my biggest issue right now with the PT is that it won't reliably display music controls. It tells me to start playing music on my phone first almost every time, but it's already playing.   I agree with the post below saying that the PT is fun. Right now, I still prefer it over my AW. I love how it looks and I rely on the alarm in the morning. Depending on your needs, the AW might be more functional, but if you're just looking to be able to read notifications quickly, the PT will do that. The AW might improve when apps run on the watch itself, but that hasn't happened yet."

pebble,3e0bjy,sheawey,2,Tue Jul 21 06:34:46 2015 UTC,I think the main advantage the time has over the original or steel is the microphone. Personally I think the color is cool but nothing special. I'd just buy the steel with the recent discounts.
pebble,3e0bjy,sheawey,2,Tue Jul 21 00:27:39 2015 UTC,"iOS user here, and it's still a great experience. Apple being a selfish brat doesn't hinder the Time like many make it out to; at least not in my opinion. To me, half the fun is cool watchfaces and the Timeline interface. It's just fun to use, simply put. The PT is definitely worth it."
pebble,3e0bjy,meconnick,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:00 2015 UTC,"And I guess it's only going to become more featured/supported in time right?

pebble,3dzaxd,WickedBad,3,Tue Jul 21 01:26:39 2015 UTC,For sure. 'Runkeeper live' is the only feature you can't use without paying for elite.  Ie. Live stream during your activity.  There's no need to pay for it.

pebble,3dzaxd,WickedBad,4,Tue Jul 21 02:09:50 2015 UTC,It drops to 2.99 periodically but if you're serious about biking or running this it is by far the most power app and worth the price. Admittedly I understand your reluctance given there are so many free apps.   I initially got it purely for the pebble app. There are so many metrics and it's infinitely  better than the standard sport API.  Moreover I've started interval training (sprints) and its feature set is really in its own class.   I do however recommend automatically exporting activities to another source (runkeeper/strava etc). Ismoothrun only real weakness is it doesn't have a cloud base activity history. Thankfully you it can automatically export to Runkeeper/Strava and many others I've never heard of.   It's also worth mentioning I've been emailing the Dev and he hopes to have a PT update at some point after he receives his PT :D

My watch vibrated and I looked down and it showed that I did it. Trouble was I was lying in bed, and had hardly walked at all. Not compared to days when I walked 5 miles and still didn't hit that point threshold. This, coupled with the fact that since the update Misfit has stopped writing data to Apple health got me to finally delete the app. What's the point in having an app that doesn't work, drains your battery, and won't write data to where it's supposed to. At this point in looking for suggestions too."

pebble,3dyti0,WickedBad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:22 2015 UTC,Thx for the replies everyone. Sad to see that I'm not alone. I guess I'll keep trying to figure something out. I don't want to have to also wear a FitBit or switch to an Apple Watch over this!
pebble,3dyti0,madshade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:49 2015 UTC,I felt this way as well until I researched all of the fitness trackers on the market today.  My findings were that wrist pedometers and optical heart rate monitors are notoriously inaccurate.  I don't think swapping to an apple watch is going to fix that.  I was extremely excited to use the pebble as a Fitness Tracker but aside from recording my time; it's really not a good option for it IMO... this lead me to research all of the other fitness trackers and I quickly found they are all rife with their own problems.  I've come to accept that my phone will do a better job than almost any other tracker out there (aside from a clip on) and that most HRM that aren't strapped to your chest aren't going to be as accurate as I'd like.  This leaves me with the dilemma of; Smartwatch or No Smartwatch.  We'll see... I bought my pebble at BB and have 30 days to decide.  A lot of this comes down to personal opinion and preference; but after using an apple watch and other smart devices (I am limited to iOS here) the pebble is the only one I find myself enjoying.

pebble,3dz3nz,shazaibahmad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:39 2015 UTC,I've seen people post in here success with doing an RMA on used devices bought second hand. I think the only risk you have is if someone did an RMA on the device you end up with and that person didn't actually return it.
pebble,3dz3nz,G3g3nsch3in,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely this. It may be possible to receive the watch from Amazon anyway, check the serial number with Pebble and if not, send it back to Amazon within those 30 days. :D"

A lot of stuff breaks easily and people know it, like some computers, but they sell it and we buy it anyways. The thing is, they have to get rid of all the stock or they'll lose a ton of fortune. They are already a small company, they can't afford these loses. That being said, screen tear can actually be fixed with tape, instead of a complete redesign. No guarantee on water resistant seal though"
pebble,3dxhjy,Dreads_Parker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:41 2015 UTC,"So why are they still selling them, if they all break?   They don't break. This is a design flaw from manufacturing.  Either your watch has it or it doesn't.    You can read all about it in this entry in our FAQ.  It sounds like you've just been unlucky so far receiving flawed units.  Either way, it's not a problem on Time."

pebble,3dw9n7,The_MAZZTer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:21:34 2015 UTC,"The only one I've tried is pixel miner. While stupidly simple, it's actually pretty fun. The expressed point of the game to to just dig as deep as you can go. Newer equipment makes you dig deeper, but costs ""pixels"". Pixels are the currency. You get the from digging and selling treasure that you uncover. Better equipment costs more. That's all well and good, but the best part is that it's really a test of how much battery you're willing to waste. The game doesn't burn much battery while it's running in the background, but you'll stop mining after 2 hours. If you keep the app open, you'll keep digging and keep uncovering treasure, but you'll burn through battery like a bitch (like, 80% overnight). This means that you're really only making money when you're burning battery."
pebble,3dw9n7,andysaurus_rex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"I play it more like a tamagotchi. So I don't keep it open and just start it from time to time to upgrade. Sure you miss treasures that way, but it's not really a big part of the game as I initially thought. The game calculates how much pixels you would have mined if left open, so it's a great little game to 'care for' every once in a while. I love it."
pebble,3dw9n7,ShinNL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but then every 2 hours the miner goes to sleep. And it does not find you treasure"
pebble,3dw9n7,andysaurus_rex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:30 2015 UTC,"Pixel Miner works well since it's a casual ""clicker"" game that plays itself when you don't play. So you can pop in, see how it's doing, and pop out.  Pokedex Challenge is great since it integrates with the notification system. Again, a casual-style game. Unfortunately it seems a bit buggy in that sometimes the notifications will just stop coming. It's been a couple weeks for me since I accidentally dismissed the last one and I'm stuck.  Cash Shaker is another fun casual ""clicker"" game, similar to Pixel Miner, but for the OG Pebble.  Most other games are just novelties... good for playing a few times but really just for the novelty."
pebble,3dw9n7,The_MAZZTer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"Pokedex Challenge you have to open every so many hours to get it to repopulate the timeline, otherwise yeah, you run out of notifications. I haven't actually played in a while just because I haven't bothered. Which is a shame, because it was fun to have them randomly pop up."
pebble,3dw9n7,fiberpunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:13 2015 UTC,"I do reopen it periodically, hasn't helped.  I've had dry spells before where it comes back.  I think what is happening is that I only have one more pokemon before I get to the next ""level"". I always have dry spells around that time. I suspect it might be, internally, selecting pokemon I already have, so then it skips a notification. It is possible for it to go on for a while without it finding a pokemon I don't have yet."

The only scratch I have is on an edge after I dropped it from face height, and that's the only damage.  Also I personally am considering on buffing the metal coating off to reveal the nice stainless steel underneath, that's another possibility"

USA corporate tax codes are FULL of loopholes that allow USA corporations to lower their typical tax payments to 25% or less (a couple of years ago GE made the headlines when they managed to get their actual tax liability down to $0!!)."
pebble,3dvmd5,rajrdajr,0,Sun Jul 19 22:37:59 2015 UTC,"This is true, but as a start up with very limited funding, I sincerely doubt they have full access to those loopholes. Obviously they do have an advantage because they can claim any money they received over the actual value of the product as a gift, but it's still pretty naive to assume that because there are loopholes that they're automatically going to take advantage of or know of their specific existence.  Sure they may not pay the 43.84% but I'd be inclined to say they're paying more than 26.5%"
pebble,3dvmd5,TheThunderbird,3,Sun Jul 19 23:09:59 2015 UTC,You have to be making a profit to pay tax... If you're short on cash you're probably respending what you're earning.

Edit: Source  Edit 2: If Eric and crew wanted to be acquired by Blackberry (which I won't dismiss out of hand as a bad idea), then wouldn't inPulse have been a better candidate than Pebble?

I received my charger, it worked and life is good.  Total time from first email to receiving a charger?  12 days.  Not bad.    I had a very similar experience with my pebble steel when the screen tearing began.

pebble,3du1cf,nocorelyt,6,Mon Jul 20 20:48:26 2015 UTC,"The problem with your statement about how well your company responds to support email is that you don't specify what their market is. If the market is support, then 48 hours is slow. Pebble's market is selling physical goods, which honestly if you have a support cycle less than a month you're better than most.   The real issue is that Pebble didn't plan for the ridiculous impatience many are exhibiting. Sending multiple emails because Pebble didn't get back to them as fast as they thought they should have. If every person sends only one extra email they're doubling the email reading, as well as requiring additional support time and energy.   Patience is a virtue. Pebble has been known for their quality customer service, that didn't suddenly stop."

pebble,3dv9mg,blooxpert,2,Sun Jul 19 20:28:01 2015 UTC,"It's rated to 30M, so unless you hit the water really hard you shouldn't have a problem. I would think that you'd be more likely to lose the strap than break the watch.  That being said, I have a Pebble Steel, not the Time. But if the waterproofing is anywhere near that of the Steel, you'll have no problems. Mine worked fine when I took it scuba diving in the rather cold water up in Banff, which I'd imagine would be more stressful on the watch than surfing."
pebble,3dv9mg,cjbentley,2,Sun Jul 19 21:21:18 2015 UTC,"I surf with my Pebble Steel all the time and have no problems whatsoever. I think I'm going to be making the upgrade to a Time pretty soon. Hopefully I'll have it before my trip to the Outer Banks in a few weeks.   Also, check out the watch face FairTides for tide info. There's a watch face that came out recently called SurfFace that looks really great. It shows Magic Seaweed surf reports. I haven't gotten a chance to actually test it out yet because my NJ surf spots haven't been added to it yet, but the developer seems pretty great about updating the face to include spot suggestions so hopefully they'll be added soon."
pebble,3dv9mg,Weezite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:25:17 2015 UTC,Any of those work away from the phone?  I had tide aware and it wouldn't work away from the phone. which is locked somewhere safe when I'm in the water.
pebble,3dv9mg,popcornfart,2,Mon Jul 20 01:12:30 2015 UTC,Not sure about SurfFace but Fair Tides keeps the tide data while I'm surfing.

pebble,3dv9mg,eMinja,2,Sun Jul 19 22:05:12 2015 UTC,Most people shower a lot longer than that. Before Pebble I didn't take my watch off to shower and now that I can respond to texts and control my music I'm even farther from showering without one. The Pebble is fully capable of it.
pebble,3dv9mg,intromatt,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:54:04 2015 UTC,I understand it's capable of it but why take the risk of something happening to it?  It takes 2 seconds to remove and 2 seconds to put back.    I love my Pebble and would never take it to the sea or even the beach and most certainly not into to a hot tub.

The saturation of these devices is so small that the more successful companies that feed the market, the better things get for everyone. Also competition spurs innovation.

pebble,3drkqu,X-Istence,16,Sat Jul 18 19:59:04 2015 UTC,"I did. I also bought the Pebble Time and the original Pebble (kickstarter 2x).  And you know what, it does more than my Pebble. ""[...] barely do anything?"" is so completely and utterly wrong.  The fitness functions are actually helping me by having me be more active (more so than for example Misfit did on my Pebble). The heart rate monitor helps me verify how quickly I recover from exercise and is actually helping me get into better shape. I tend to get up and walk more, the whole game-ification of fitness is awesome.  Being able to quickly respond to text messages/email's from my watch is also awesome, calendar on my wrist (including ability to go forward/backwards). Tying in with Siri means I can quickly add new todo's to reminders while walking and I think about them.  I really enjoy the ability to use Apple Pay from my watch, this is one of the lesser features for many people, but a lot of the places I go to on a regular basis now have Apple Pay available, which means I can use a more secure mechanism of paying (less likely my card data will be compromised since it generates a random card number), and not having to take my wallet out of my pocket is awesome.  The one feature that really makes the whole thing is that you can use the Apple Watch for storage for music, and then you can connect your bluetooth headphones directly to your watch. So these days I can go to the gym, and leave my phone in my locker and wear just my watch and my head phones while still enjoying music."

pebble,3drkqu,disenchanted_youth,3,Sun Jul 19 18:54:39 2015 UTC,The apple watch literally inspired me to step back into the gym after 2 years. $350 is a small price to pay for something that inspires you to live better.  I love how it nags you if you don't meet your daily goals.

pebble,3drkqu,disenchanted_youth,2,Sun Jul 19 00:00:41 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. And the best part is, hitting the daily goal isn't hard. Sometimes I just load up a movie or TV show on my phone, prop it up on the exercise bike and mindlessly pedal away while watching the show. This might be frowned upon by hardcore gym goers but it's an effective way to forget about the pain and about being tired. By the end of the show, I've burned a hefty amount of calories."

And I can pay for things without having to get my card out of my pocket (lots of places use contactless in the UK)  I get that the Pebble Time can do most of that to some extent on Android / jailbroken iPhones, but to me the Apple Watch is vastly superior.

Haven't coded anything in Java in about 15 years (yay for first-year uni!) There's a few issues I'd need to sort with APIs. I currently use Apple's APIs for getting the actual turn-by-turn directions, which is free/unlimited. While Google of course has a Directions API, their free limits wouldn't be sufficient, so = $$. This means either finding another API or I'd have to charge a minor ongoing subscription or a higher upfront price, which I don't really want to do. So if anyone knows any other decent APIs, let me know! And of course, finding enough time to do all the coding. This is really the major issue. Maybe in a few months I'll have the chance, don't really at the moment.   Hope this helps explain why it hasn't happened so far. It is on the list at least, but can't give anything like an ETA.

pebble,3drqks,Crigger540,6,Sat Jul 18 23:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'd hesitantly say they've always had issues. While support is absoluetely lovely, I've had a dead Steel, and my current one, now out of warranty, has dying buttons.  All that aside, I'd still buy myself a new Steel if this one died, it's become my everyday use device now, haven't let it die in 6+ months."

pebble,3drqks,DogecoinAthletics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:35:00 2015 UTC,My new time looks exactly the same. I'm wondering should I return it to best buy for a new one or try submerging it and see what happens.
pebble,3drqks,carajean2725,2,Sun Jul 19 09:55:58 2015 UTC,Submerge it.
pebble,3drqks,DogecoinAthletics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:43:26 2015 UTC,How long does it take for this fog to occur? I submerged it in a glass for like 5 minutes and nothing. It was luke warm water
pebble,3drqks,carajean2725,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:28:53 2015 UTC,If the watch still works than it is most likely sealed.  Just take some warm/ hot showers with it to make sure the heat has.no effect.

pebble,3drqks,Gambizzle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:54 2015 UTC,Mine starts to do the same but it's not as bad... Yet. I just stopped wearing it while showering. Hoping it will survive long enough for my PTS to be delivered.
pebble,3drqks,andysaurus_rex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:41:18 2015 UTC,Widespread problem or just yours?
pebble,3drqks,Gambizzle,2,Sun Jul 19 00:55:55 2015 UTC,Hard to say. Many have an issue with not being water resistant. Not sure if this is the problem with all of them.
pebble,3drqks,andysaurus_rex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I personally won't be swimming or showering with mine, however, I occasionally walk in the rain or splash my watch while washing my hands."
pebble,3drqks,neanderthalensis,3,Sun Jul 19 01:57:38 2015 UTC,It should be resistant up to 30 meters. If it dies due to water damage they should replace it no questions asked.
pebble,3drqks,andysaurus_rex,0,Sun Jul 19 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but when you know they don't exactly have the most stellar QA, it's in your best interest to not take chances."
pebble,3drqks,theNEWgoodgoat,5,Sun Jul 19 02:21:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree. They will replace your Time if it breaks, it's best to find out if it will or won't sooner while it's still under warranty. Plus then you don't have to live in fear of it possibly breaking, because you'll know for sure."
pebble,3drqks,andysaurus_rex,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"mine died as well, i shower with it every day for a month but it just died when i went for a swim. my RMA is on the way. their support team is great but i think pebble should really fix this problem. it isnt good business for us and them. not good for us cuz we have defective products that fail at their intended features and purposes and not good for them cuz they have to keep giving out RMAs, losing money."
pebble,3drqks,FooFatFighters,2,Sun Jul 19 03:07:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. We forgive them though because they're a kickstarter company. It's bullshit though. No legitimate company would be able to behave like this and still succeed. But they are riding on their success of the original kickstarter. If you want to be a big boy company, it's time to put your big boy pants on and cut the kickstarter crap and fix the manufacturing errors. It's really not acceptable"
pebble,3drqks,andysaurus_rex,2,Sun Jul 19 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"Come on, Apple and other companies have had all kinds of problems/recalls. I actually got a brand new unibody MacBook Pro because my non-unibody MacBook Pro was under AppleCare and needed to get the logic board replaced for the third time. It was because of the faulty Nvidia GPU.  And don't forget to check your airbag on the recall list of vehicles."

pebble,3dtb0l,xkittybunnyx,3,Sun Jul 19 06:30:29 2015 UTC,There is no API to do anything with the mic right now.
pebble,3dtb0l,MorrisTimm,2,Sun Jul 19 08:24:41 2015 UTC,TL;DR: The mic API will be opened up and developers will undoubtedly do awesome stuff with it.   Will developers have access to the microphone? What can we do with it? Absolutely. We will give developers access to our speech-to-text APIs. You will be able to show a UI to start a recording and your app will receive the text spoken by the user. This API is coming soon™ - not in 3.0. We are considering other APIs such as direct microphone access. Stay tuned for more information on those.

pebble,3ds357,Protonus,0,Sun Jul 19 04:19:05 2015 UTC,"Pebble Time's speech to text I find on average, works at least as good, if not better, than Google's on my phone.   That's considering speed and accuracy.  And that's incredibly impressive since Time only has one mic, so it can't do noise cancellation, and the results are sent back and forth thru your phone."
pebble,3ds357,al3x094,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"Do you think with the Microphone API that's slated to release, developers can opt to use Google's Text-to-Speech engine?"
pebble,3ds357,ThePenultimateOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:48 2015 UTC,"Probably not. I can think of three reasons why:   both major OSs use online speech APIs as far as I'm aware, you can't change this for either (without root/jailbreak)  the added lag would be horrendous from a user perspective   So I can totally understand why Pebble would go the route they have, thus far, I just disagree with them. I don't like Nuance's software, and I'd rather use a better one."
pebble,3ds357,rkmvca,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"=( I honestly don't know. I have no option that I've seen to change it to Google's. It would be great if I could.   Oh! I forgot to mention Google now. It's great on the Motorola 360, and it doesn't exist on the pebble"
pebble,3ds357,J_Ar_7,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great review!  Does anyone know when Motorola is planning an update to our successor for the 360?
pebble,3ds357,Protonus,2,Sun Jul 19 08:16:36 2015 UTC,"Try using the app ""backlight"". This essentially eliminates your ""flailing arm"" problem to get the backlight on and you can set a timer for the light to stay on. It uses your activity tracking slot but all you really need to do is tilt the watch to your face and the backlight comes on.   EDIT: You can even set an arranged time for backlight to come into use. I typically have it set around 6 PM when I'm out of work and not always in the best lighting situation."

I have the opposite experience.  The only thing Pebble's speech to text fails on me, is the fact that Dragon censors curse words, which is fucking annoying as shit.

pebble,3duiqd,collenbyer,4,Sun Jul 19 16:39:25 2015 UTC,"If you're jailbroken, yes on both, but there is no mic on the older models, so you'd have to used canned responses, which aren't bad at all. If you're not jailbroken, like me, then no. You cannot reply to any message on iOS, unless jailbroken, once Pebble gets the stuff out for the mic, iOS users will be able to reply to Gmail (sarcastic ""yay"") which sucks. It is not Pebble's fault though, it is because Apple refuses to let any other watch do it. If you're on iOS, the only smartwatches you can get is the Apple Watch or Pebble. Android Wear or Samsung Galaxy Gear won't work with your phone."
pebble,3duiqd,sheawey,2,Sun Jul 19 17:26:14 2015 UTC,Jailbroken pebble user here. I highly recommend the Jailbroken iPhone+PT combo. In my opinion it's more functional than even the apple watch.

pebble,3duiqd,xadamxk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:49:14 2015 UTC,"Although I have the steel and not the time, I can give some feedback that would match his. 1) I can force all notifications to show on my Pebble along with being able to control which do and do not show up. Not only that, but I can also make it so when I am using my phone (it is unlocked) notifications are not pushed to my watch. 2) There is a smartwatch app called Smartwatch+ that comes with 2 watchapps - Smartwatch+ and SmartStatus. SmartStatus displays everything you could want on a watch face: weather, date, time, weather forcast, temp, email notifications, text notifications, phone notifications, pebble battery, and your phone's battery. And smartwatch+ gives you access to: your phones recent call list, your recent texts, a weather forecast, a ""Find my iPhone"" beep feature, a camera activator, gps apps, calendar access, etc etc. 3) Have you ever disconnected from your Pebble and realized that the BlueTooth notifcations aren't working anymore? That is because of a bug with BT but you can download a patch for that. 4) You can activate Siri using the Pebble 5) Lastly, although it is something small, you can have a pebble icon appear on your iPhone's status bar when you are connected to your watch."

AppFaces are previews of your app that are displayed in the launcher before the user starts your app. To use them, your app will need to support being launched without a UI to update the AppFace.  AppFaces will not be part of Pebble SDK when we launch Pebble Time. Your apps will just appear with their name until we add this API at a later stage. This also means that your app icons defined in the appinfo.json are not used with the new launcher (but they will still appear on Aplite until 3.0 ships for Aplite)  What are AppFaces and when can we use them?"

pebble,3ds1nd,Afinkawan,3,Sat Jul 18 22:23:29 2015 UTC,It means that either: the waterproofing isn't working properly or moisture was sealed in it at manufacture (can happen when it's very humid).    Either way you can and should get a replacement.

After comparing all 4 buttons I'd say that the up button is very close to the others... if it does take less pressure or if it has less 'give' compared to the others it is by just a very little.  All of my buttons seem to take a fair bit of pressure to push.  None of them feel like they make a 'click' though.

(I believe if you change the notification settings on each event, you'd change them for other subscribed members. Prob. not good for work schedules.)  To hide specific calendars, go to the calendar app and click on ""calendars"" along the bottom. Uncheck the ones you want to hide."
pebble,3dr4it,truthcopy,2,Sun Jul 19 15:11:20 2015 UTC,Go to the pebble app on your phone then to my pebble then to apps/timeline and find the Calendar app. Hit the gear icon next to it and you can choose which google calendars are in your timeline.
pebble,3dr4it,AsAnAside,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:33:52 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong on this but I think calendar alerts are independent of ios alerts since they sync with the watch and are stored on the watch. As far as i know there is no way to disable notifications for a specific calendar. What you may be able to do is ""unsync/desync"" that specific calendar from your pebble but that would remove that entire calendar from pebble rather than just silencing its notifications."
pebble,3dr4it,J_Ar_7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:06:33 2015 UTC,"If the Android method doesn't work, go to the ""Calendar"" app, and tap ""Calendars"" at the bottom. There you can uncheck their calendars, so they won't show up on your phone and won't give you alerts."
pebble,3dr4it,kitfm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:10:06 2015 UTC,Most apps that are for the Timeline will have a notification function. Best you can do it turn off the notification for Calendars. I do this because I use Fantasical and prefer to see that app send a notification.

It sucks that myfitnesspal only has support for a few step trackers but I'm just trying to work with what I have. The steps arent a huge dealbreaker because I generally just go on runs to exercise with GPS apps and get pretty accurate calories, but for those days when you're just walking around a ton and dont want to GPS track the whole time... Not much going on.  I found that plexfit is pretty darn accurate about steps and doesnt count 500 steps in my sleep (like the current edition of Misfit) but it only syncs to Google Fit.  I'm trying out Up for Jawbone now, and it seems accurate, tracks to myfitnesspal too but if you change the watch face, it doesnt regularly sync to myfitness pal, and you cant see an exact step counter (increments of 100 with isnt awful)  Alas. Maybe someone will get their stuff together with the huge influx of users with the current release of Pebble Time"

pebble,3doqqk,sheawey,7,Sat Jul 18 01:06:01 2015 UTC,Do you know how pebble knows to use the notification icons?  Are they reading the app off of the notification or somehow directly integrated with the app on the phone?
pebble,3doqqk,guitmusic11,3,Sat Jul 18 01:22:06 2015 UTC,"The system provides the name of the app, which the Pebble App then processes and attaches the custom icon to the notification. Same goes for phone calls. When it sees the Phone app, it pulls up the dialer animation that plays on a cycle."

All of the Apps on the Pebble Appstore require that you be running Pebble Firmware 2.0+. What version firmware is your Pebble running? I might be wrong, but I believe support for Android 2.3 stopped with Pebble 1.x firmware.  Honestly you should upgrade your phone for reasons beyond 3rd party accessory compatibility. Android 2.3 is 5 years out of date, and if you are on a GSM carrier you should be able to find a more modern Android 4.4+ phone for around $60 contract-free."

pebble,3drsd0,almightywhacko,2,Sun Jul 19 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"If you like it, then keep it. However, software keyboards are significantly more accurate than they were when your phone was released, you might honestly wanna give them a try and see if you actually need that physical keyboard.

pebble,3drsd0,Protonus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:21:25 2015 UTC,"This is the part where normally I check XDA and look for an aftermarket ROM for Android 4.x of some variety to fix all your issues.  But I just looked up that phone. Even when it was released in 2011 it was outdated.  That phone is using seriously ancient hardware - 512 MB of RAM, 320x480px display, and so on.  I've never owned an Android phone with that low of specs and I've had Android phones since 2010.   Even the original Samsung Galaxy S from 2010 is a dramatic improvement to this device - and we're not on the Galaxy S6 - that's 6 generations that phone is behind.   There is absolutely no aftermarket or developer community for that phone as it just isn't worth anything.   You could buy many, many, older, great condition used Android phones for no joke just $30-$50 right now off craigslist or eBay that would absolutely blow this phone away, and be capable of running Android 4.x, an even Android 4.3+ so you could use the new Android Wear support Pebble has.  Nexus 4, Nexus 5, LG G2, LG G3, Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, HTC One M7 or M8, Note 2/Note 3, an so on. Any of these phones would be a tremendous upgrade to that device!"

pebble,3dr30i,almightywhacko,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed that's the issue. I don't think the issue would persist on PTS.

pebble,3dr1wv,anarayan2015,3,Sat Jul 18 17:06:12 2015 UTC,Notification Centre is the app you want - you can set a do not disturb that only lets those texts through and set the vibration pattern you want and set it to vibrate until you dismiss it on the watch.
pebble,3dr1wv,Afinkawan,3,Sat Jul 18 17:25:21 2015 UTC,I could be wrong here (I don't use it) but isn't Notification Center only available on Android?
pebble,3dr1wv,Xreeperz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:40:40 2015 UTC,Don't think you can do the continuous vibration for a text on either iOS or Android.
pebble,3dr1wv,Brad93525,2,Sat Jul 18 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Number 3 Is your failure point, I don't think you can get the functionality you're looking for with stock iOS.   All iOS notifications are pushed to Pebble, unless a DND is activated. You cannot selectively choose which apps, much less which contacts, send notifications to Prbble. Android does have a Notifications center app as u/Afinkawan mentioned, but when I moved to iOS I could not find a similar app without jail breaking.   As others have mentioned, same is the case with constant vibration based on iOS notifications. Maybe something you could pull off with Tasker on Android (or similar on a jailbroken iPhone) but unlikely on stock iOS  Edit:Formatting. Also, you should still buy a Pebble. Get the Pebble Time and a skin + new strap that you like."

I set the alerts for specific numbers on my phone and when telephoned it does not stop vibrating until the ringing for the call ends.   Two additional distinct advantages:   The vibration function only awakens me. That's true for alarms, calls, texts, alerts, etc. The light from the face is bright enough for me to see my way to the bathroom once my feet hit the floor, but dark enough that again, I am often the only one awoken."
pebble,3dr1wv,gentlemanphilanderer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:27:53 2015 UTC,"That's great news. Do you have an android phone or iPhone? What app are you using to set the number of rings for a text. I said text specifically because my company won't call me, only text me."
pebble,3dr1wv,DanTheDane,2,Sat Jul 18 18:37:38 2015 UTC,"Your company could consider a service like pagerduty. Here you can setup triggers, so e.g. it could call you once a trigger is activated. In there you can also have escalation policies, so if you don't react within a given time, it will go to the next point of contact.  Only relying on text messages sounds a little vulnerable to me"
pebble,3dr1wv,AlecEdworthy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"Just to warn you, Do Not Disturb on the iPhone suppresses ALL text message notifications when active, even people on the VIP list do not get through.

You'll get a lot shorter battery lifetime (how long before it stops holding as much of a charge) if you drain it to 0 and charge it straight back up.   Lithium ions last the longest when kept between about 30-80% charge, with small discharges and recharges. They don't suffer from memory effects like older NiCads etc.   Obviously that's not practical but just don't run it flat, as you damage the battery cells (when it finally turns off, that's the protection circuit of the battery kicking in to prevent cells from discharging too much).

pebble,3dnp6l,MrAnseBundren,7,Fri Jul 17 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"Had to look up ""Big 4 firm""...  Wow.  I recall when it was still ""Big Eight""!  My mom worked for one of the ""Big Eight,"" back when it was still eight - one of the few to survive today as one of the Big Four.  She retired just a couple years ago, as the longest-tenured employee of her location at the time.  She still has some items with the logo and branding back when it was still the Big Eight.  (A few mergers/names ago.)"
pebble,3dnp6l,charonpdx,39,Fri Jul 17 23:42:38 2015 UTC,"Yeahhh I'd wear a proper time piece or nothing at all over that. Sorry, but hope you get the job."
pebble,3dnp6l,Liquid_Clown,23,Fri Jul 17 19:52:44 2015 UTC,All of the people I interviewed with were wearing various smart watches. They all mentioned the value of being able to glance at the watch in meetings instead of having interruptions from phones.
pebble,3dnp6l,eoddc5,6,Fri Jul 17 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"I'd do it. And am planning on it when I interview next week. Though I plan on using a simple analog face.... ""Thin modded"" love it for my fancy times   I have a nice leather band for it now.  Can you let me know where you bought the band?"
pebble,3dnp6l,eoddc5,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:11 2015 UTC,Band came from eBay - $8.95.

pebble,3dnp6l,Wwwi7891,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:29:27 2015 UTC,Does the mesh grab hairs at all? I'm thinking of getting that.
pebble,3dnp6l,sirpaul589,4,Sat Jul 18 06:19:15 2015 UTC,"I had no issue with the way the actual watch looked, but I think it was a poor choice of watch face. The normal stock one is pretty good or something like a rolex watch face. And ideally you would hope that it would go unnoticed.  But hey, I don't think that is going to slow you down any. You're probably doing better off than me, so what do I know?"
pebble,3dnp6l,BrosephGordon-Levitt,13,Fri Jul 17 21:31:07 2015 UTC,An actual Rolex can be tacky under the right circumstances. A low res black and white watch face that says Rolex on it is about the tackiest thing I can possibly imagine to wear on your wrist.
pebble,3dnp6l,sirpaul589,4,Sat Jul 18 06:23:16 2015 UTC,"Have to agree - at least go for steel version. Might work if you're a student or fresh grad working in tech industry, though."
pebble,3dnp6l,MathewReiss,7,Fri Jul 17 19:56:20 2015 UTC,"I will get the steel version when it's available.  Not sure about the water resistance of this ks version - it's kinda creaky.  The position is in tech and all 7 of the interviewers spent some time checking out the watch. All of them had smart watches - a few Apple watches, a couple OG pebbles, and the Fitbit ones that have the big face."
pebble,3dnp6l,Boodz,2,Fri Jul 17 20:11:58 2015 UTC,"I have the Steel, and I work in the software industry. I get compliments all the time, and even talk about hobbyist development in most interviews."

pebble,3dnp6l,andysaurus_rex,4,Sat Jul 18 03:50:07 2015 UTC,So I think the skin reflects at a bad angle - I imagine this looks quite good. And I'd argue the PT looks better than the PTS for style.   Which of the big four?
pebble,3dnp6l,vermilions,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, bad angle. Sky and clouds are reflected on the face (skinomi screen protector on it)."

pebble,3dnp6l,oneyozfest182,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure I'd choose that skin, but I don't think it looks as bad as everyone else says. I think it can be dressed up pretty well"
pebble,3dnp6l,foxfire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:17 2015 UTC,Could do with a screen wipe... Like the strap but not the bezel.
pebble,3dnp6l,oneyozfest182,3,Fri Jul 17 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry - it's just the reflection of the sky and clouds - if you zoom you can see it. Otherwise the screen is very clear.  I've rotated through a lot of watch faces and this one works the best for my work environment - inside my house or office all day under artificial light. I think it looks great outside as well (without the sky reflection). I have a skinomi screen protector on it as well.    As for the negative comments - I get it. I was told by some people to not do it. Other contacts that I have inside the firm said the best thing to do is be myself.  Be myself is what I decided to do.  If an organization weighs my wristwatch over my experience, knowledge, skills, and education then I don't want to be part of that organization.  I've got plenty of other opportunities."
pebble,3dogah,jun2san,4,Fri Jul 17 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"If you use bicycle or motorcycle, I'd suggest attaching it to the handlebar and using Ventoo (former Pebble Bike). I'm thinking of doing it if/when I get a PT."

pebble,3dovea,magnets1026,5,Sat Jul 18 01:15:42 2015 UTC,"This is great to hear! Stuff like this is what reassures me that I made the right choice in going with the (OG) Pebble rather than a knockoff or the Applewhatever. I'm loving mine and it's one of those products that's designed to last, and if there's a problem then they actually want to help you fix it.  I know, I'm sounding like a corporate shill! But I'm just incredibly happy with my watch and plan to get the Time at some point in the future once I've got more money. And I really like knowing that my suspicions about the company are confirmed."
pebble,3dovea,NewMerril,2,Sat Jul 18 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. They have identified problems with two of mine, and replaced them free of charge. Very happy with Pebble support, and because of this, I will be sticking with them for a long time to come."
pebble,3dovea,zzubnik,2,Sat Jul 18 13:19:45 2015 UTC,I've been going back and forth with support over a defective Time since July 1st. Doesn't feel so awesome over here.
pebble,3dovea,heppbabby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"Is it the charging issue or something else they think you may have caused?  Maybe they're less willing to replace Times right now because of the high demand.  I'm not surprised to hear they aren't perfect, just thought I'd share a positive experience."
pebble,3dovea,heppbabby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:03:52 2015 UTC,My Time has a noticeably crooked screen. At some point I was passed from support@ to sales@ and asked to give my shipping info so a replacement could be sent.  Nothing since.
pebble,3dovea,TheBaconatorMC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think they're just backed up, they warned me that they had a high volume of requests so I didn't expect to have mine sent so fast.  I didn't hear anything for a few days so I asked about the status, no one ever replied but the I got my shipping confirmation about 2 days later.  They may have put your replacement on lower priority since it doesn't really hinder using it.  Good luck!"
pebble,3dovea,awhawkeye,2,Sat Jul 18 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"I wish I had the same luck! But I hear Pebble support is swamped right now, so it's just a waiting game."

pebble,3dnkfg,Lucas2301,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:42 2015 UTC,Grabbed the last steel from the Rockville Pike location in Rockville/Bethesda; the guy told me there was one more he saw in stock in the Montgomery Mall (this was Tuesday).  I can confirm that the stores in Frederick don't even know what a Pebble is and the Gaithersburg (square) location was out of Steels but had two OGs as of Tuesday.

I uninstalled the current version of Google My Tracks from my phone Installed the Pebble My Tracks APK from the developer (from here)  Ran the Pebble My Tracks app Let the app install the old version of Google My Tracks Went into Google My Tracks, clicked Settings > Advanced > Allow access Went back into Pebble My Tracks, Settings > Go to Pebble Appstore, Installed the Pebble watch app   When I launch the My Tracks app on my watch, I get a startup/loading animation with ""booting""...""protecting"" text and then the Pebble My Tracks watchface.  Long press to start/stop seems to be working, screen is updating, and its recording a track in Google My Tracks.  Incidentally, I'm on a Cyanogenmod nightly (CM12.1 / 5.1.1) on my OnePlus One... rooted + the alpha Xposed (not that it should matter).

Only thing is the icons on the side are a bit small, and I'd rather the calendar icon wasn't there, just the day/date/month.  Pretty minor complaints too.  I also have to say that the author using 'send to phone' instead of 'save' or 'submit' is a nice UI touch to make it feel more professional."

pebble,3dmkdr,megagoosey,2,Fri Jul 17 17:50:56 2015 UTC,"Same here. Having the white background helps alleviate the problem of the time being a little dim.

pebble,3dpus1,Tachypsychia,2,Sat Jul 18 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"Does the same with me with endomondo. I find the pebble run tracking really shit, the apps are OK but the constant freezing is making me go back to looking at Garmin/polar type devices.  Only thing I can suggest is if I restart the pebble it usually gets it working again. But who really wants to be dicking around with it when you are running...  Sorry no help just you aren't alone!"
pebble,3dpus1,Wazlington,2,Sat Jul 18 08:12:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply regardless!  I might do a restart before each run just in case. If that works I can live with it. to be fair i had a lot of apps on the watch that I was working with before just in the ""new toy"" phase, so maybe I slowed it down some..."
pebble,3dpus1,mattbrich,2,Sat Jul 18 08:19:02 2015 UTC,"It's not developed for pebble time yet but I've used aerotracker pro since its way more convenient and configurable than runkeeper (it syncs to rk too). My only gripe is the pause function isn't really a pause (you can't move during your pause out else your data is messed up). Otherwise, its great. Might keep a lookout for it."

pebble,3dpus1,juanpg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:30:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that...maybe try Strava. I had issues similar to what you are having with Endomondo.  There's a pebble ""Strava starter"" to initiate from the watch. Hopefully Jurgen with AeroTracker Pro will release it for the Time sometime soon. I think it would be a good solution as it's worked great for me (and has a feature that keeps the app alive on your android at all costs)."
pebble,3dpus1,TheBaconatorMC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:26 2015 UTC,Ok so it's definitely a firmware issue. I reflashed my phone back to stock and did nothing but install pebble time and sync and went for a quick drive with runkeeper. The app had no problem keeping up with the constantly changing distance and pace for the 10 minutes or so I happened to be out doing errands.  So now I get to play with custom ROMs until i find one that I like that works fine with the Pebble Sport API.. yay fun times.  I may also just switch to endomondo just because you can choose other stuff besides time distance and average pace. I'm really surprised that its Avg pace and not Current pace on runkeeper but alas.
pebble,3dpus1,mattbrich,2,Tue Jul 21 06:18:41 2015 UTC,Looks like it may be an issue with the custom firmware my phone is running. Going to try a few other running apps that support pebble sport api but it very may well be just the phone. I know giving up stock on phones means I could lose functionality but I like having fun control over my electronics.

pebble,3doau7,FooFatFighters,3,Fri Jul 17 22:13:53 2015 UTC,"Openweathermap.org is easy to use, free (no limits on number of requests) and used in the Pebble programming tutorials. That's why it's so commonly used. Openweathermap gets its data from private weather stations. They aren't always placed optimally which can lead to strange temperature readings. Another factor is the algorithms Openweathermap use to calculate the weather for areas where there aren't any stations.   Other weather providers can be very expensive for everything other than testing purposes. If a watch face polls the weather every 30 minutes that's 48 checks per day. Say a watch face has 100 users that's 4800 requests per day. If you want to use Wunderground for example you'd need to pay $20/month. If there are just a few more users, just 5 more actually, the cost rises to $200/month!  Forecast.io is available for about $12 for the same amount of watch face users. Quite possible to cover with donations or something, but are Pebble users prepared to pay for a watch face?    I have switched over to Yahoo Weather (from Openweathermap) as the weather source for my watch face DIN Time. Yahoo is also free up to a certain limit, which I don't hope to hit. It's better than Openweathermap but but suffers from the same problem, in some areas it doesn't have a reliable weather source and can be a bit off.   NOAA weather data is only available in United States and the Atlantic. Mainland Europe, Asia and so on isn't available.  Pebbleme: DIN Time"

I use your beautiful watchface DIN Time as my standard since it's a great watchface and has accurate weather on it.  I figured NOAA would only work in the USA since it's an American govt thing. Pebble should probably have a tutorial with a standard module that lets users choose their weather sources.  The person with the OW station in Hilo, Hawaii must be living in a cave with the readings they're providing. Mahalo for the info."

The other think I was gonna do was find a custom font for the clock that mimics a LED panel, and maybe add some animations. As for the defcon meter, I looked online and couldn't find a json api to get a live feed for that. So for now, the meter is just for show. If your wondering what I used to code it, I just used Pebble.js. Its pretty simple, all the documentation is on developer.getpebble.com and I made it on cloudpebble.com.

To join the game, simply open the app. Shortly after starting, you will receive your first tag within your timeline. This first tag will be easy to find, the subsequent ones slightly less so.... The tag will report your current score and rank. When you receive it, it will give you a selection of recipients to send the tag to. When you select a recipient, the tag will be sent to them, and you will be awarded the points value of the tag.   Tags start out worth 1 point, and their points value increments each time the tag is sent to a recipient. The more a tag is forwarded on, the higher it's points value, so make sure you keep forwarding them on!   The tags will arrive silently to some point on the timeline, so you'll have to keep an eye out to make sure you don't miss any. Any tags that drop off your timeline without being forwarded on will die.   Hint: Look out for your own ID in the recipients list for the tag - you could get more points by sending it back to yourself to do it all again!

Shipments to the first Pebble Time Steel backers will begin the last week of July. Backers at the end of the Time Steel line should receive tracking numbers by the end of August. Pebble Time Steel rewards ship as soon as our distribution centers around the world receive watches from the factory and process them for final delivery.  The delivery timeframe for Pebble Time Steel rewards is a little off from the original estimate we shared during the campaign, but we’ll get everything shipped as fast as possible. The steps involved in a Pebble Time Steel’s journey from factory to wrist are outlined below. If you’re curious about the process, check it out!  Pebble Time Steel rewards come with both a leather band and a matching steel band. When Time Steel arrives at retail, the metal band will be sold as a separate accessory. Due to reduced initial availability from our supplier, we’ll include the metal bands in a single shipment for every backer possible, and send metal bands in a separate shipment for the remaining backers, as more become available."

Details:   No specific date has been officially released; however, Pebble reps have said that they're aiming for ""2-3 months after Kickstarter Pebble Time Steel has finished shipping"" and ""later in 2015"". The last Pebble Time Steel Kickstarter tier shipping date was estimated as August, 2015.  Kickstarter Update #24 says that shipping for tier II, August 2015 won't begin until mid-September.1  <reality-check> Putting these statements together means that PebbleOS v3 for Classic & Steel might ship on December 31st, 2015 for Android (it will almost certainly require a phone app update and Pebble has a history of favoring Android over iOS). Assume that Pebble calculates dates like this: August 31st September 10th Pebble Time Steel tier II shipments start, add the 3 full months - the partial month of September doesn't count was sucked up by schedule slip - of October, November & December. </reality-check>   It turns out that the limiting statement from Pebble officials was ""later in 2015"".  December 31st is the last day that they can meet a 2015 ship date.      Kickstarter Update #24 (added emphasis and [editorial clarification]):   ""Shipments to the first Pebble Time Steel backers [i.e. July 2015 tier] will begin the last week of July.

pebble,3dkqzz,ContraVern,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:20:11 2015 UTC,"For Facebook, I just see ""So-and-so commented on your status."" and for Outlook, all I see is the subject line and sender name. Before, I could actually read the FB comment and part of the email body."
pebble,3dkqzz,ContraVern,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of email body and lack of actions might be a Microsoft app design issue. I have the same limitation if I use Outlook for Android or Skype. I setup my outlook account in the old email app on my G3 and turned off 'Outlook for Android' notifications in that app's settings.  Now I receive notifications from the email app that include the body of the email and are fully actionable.   I am not sure about the Facebook notifications, but the above gave me the ability to reply and delete emails from my Pebble Time."
pebble,3dkqzz,FM2001,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm beginning to think. It seems that FB notifications used to show part of a comment or post, but now it's just bare bones details, which is what shows up on my PT.  In any case, I've set up my work email on the Samsung Email app, and it works great! Thanks for the suggestion. :)"
pebble,3dkzuq,sonicsizzors,3,Fri Jul 17 03:03:45 2015 UTC,"First off, try restarting your Pebble. If that doesn't work out, try restarting your iPhone.   If that doesn't work out, go to Settings>Bluetooth>Forget Device. And then repair using the Pebble app.   If that doesn't work, reset the Pebble to factory firmware. Hope this helps!"

pebble,3dkzuq,Niuron,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:57:53 2015 UTC,I still have to restart the Pebble Time sometimes to fix it. It happen to me on iOS 8.1.1 and still happens on 8.4. Hopefully they will improve it in future updates.

A couple of thoughts - the opening animation is a little choppy, not sure if TH3 or Shadow are open source, but it may be worth seeing how they do opening animations.

pebble,3dit3o,xadamxk,2,Fri Jul 17 00:39:19 2015 UTC,"Based on your reply and other replies to what you said, I'm going to throw some things out at you. I got a Pebble only two weeks ago, so I am extremely familiar and confident on what I am going to say.     Notification Issue  iOS, unlike Android, has a closed system and a sandbox in place. This simply means that each app can not mess with other apps. Well what does this mean for you?   In short, it means the Pebble app can not grab other app's notifications and push them to the Pebble. Yes, it is stupid, but it is a security prevention.     How to Fix In order to 'bypass' that security restriction, you must ""root"" your iDevice. The term for this is often referred to as jailbreaking. You can find more information about jailbreaking here: /r/jailbreak I have been a jailbreak user for almost 6 years now, so I should be able to help you with any questions you may have. (Feel free to message me)   Jailbreaking Because jailbreaking your device ""frees"" your device from several restraints placed by Apple, they do not condone it. With that being said, they try to patch jailbreaks are they are released. The most current (public) iOS version is iOS 8.4, which has a jailbreak available for it. I can walk you through the process and explain more if you are interested.   After Jailbreaking    You can install what are called ""Tweaks"" through Cydia (which is an app that is added during the jailbreak process). Several developers have made tweaks for Pebble smartwatches:    Pebble Status: Show's a pebble icon when connected to the watch in the status bar.  PebbleProfiles: Allows you to regulate notifications and push them to the watch.  SmartWatch+: Allows you to set activation commands, custom smartwatch faces, and several other features with your phone.  BTNotificationEnabler: Allows notifications to be pushed over BlueTooth."

pebble,3dit3o,Jpasholk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:12 2015 UTC,"Do you use PebbleProfiles to jailbreak? I'm just trying to figure out where I ought to start, gauge the risks, etc."
pebble,3dit3o,kitfm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:18:54 2015 UTC,No. Jailbreaking is basically rooting your iPhone and gaining full system access. PebbleProfiles is a tweak you can install once you've done that. Definitely do your research on Jailbreaking and understand what it entails first. It definitely has it's pros and cons.
pebble,3dit3o,hopesdead,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:36:35 2015 UTC,AFAIK PebbleProfiles hasn't been updated for 8.3 or 8.4 yet.

Means you won't know if a notification came in unless the device is unlocked (which you can check Notification Center to see them)."

I've seen a couple comments from folks on here along the lines of ""Well, Misfit sync now syncs with Android. I guess I'll have to give up Battery+ and switch to Misfit.""  If I was running Pebble, I'd buy the code for Battery+ and add it to the Pebble OS in the next version.

But it is a very simple process to do). Out of the box, you get the ability to receive notifications of your phone. Which is, if you receive a message on Whatsapp, or a SMS, you can see and reply with a simple canned answer. You can see who is calling, cancel the call if you can't pick it up at the moment etc.   You'll have the ability to install ""watchfaces"", that are different looks - either analogical or digital, but also showing the temperature, calendar etc. - and ""watchapps"", that can be all kinds different stuff.

pebble,3djks7,Rawbex,2,Thu Jul 16 23:23:54 2015 UTC,"The second main issue is I can't reply to text messages on my Pebble Time. Honestly if they announced when/if it's even possible to reply to texts in the future I would keep it. Unfortunately there is a grim outlook for iOS users. Yes it is my fault for not being informed of the voice function not working for iOS devices. However I just want to be able to receive and reply to text messages without using my phone.   Apple problem, Pebble very likely cannot fix it (and as such cannot give an ETA for when it will be fixed). If you want it supported you're going to have to complain to Apple, and the more people you can get to actually do it the better. No internet petitions either, too easy to ignore. Get a load of people to send actual email, or better yet physical mail, and you may see an effect.   I really enjoyed my pebble time but there are two major problems that make me wish I purchased an apple watch instead.    Apple is like an abusive relationship, they keep telling you what you're not allowed to do. You can't see other people (watches)! You have to go through me (BLE) if you want to talk to your friends (get notifications). Don't support that, fight it. The last thing you want to do is reward behaviors you don't agree with, it's why more parents need to teach their kids that a tantrum won't get them what they want.  EDIT: Formatting"

However I went with the option to get a 6+ instead of an android   Why not sell the 6+ then and get an Android phone, rather then selling your watch and supporting Apple's practices of restricting what their users can do with their own devices, by buying an Apple watch?   One issue is it randomly disconnects from Bluetooth almost twice an hour   To fix this, follow this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/wiki/faq#wiki_q.3A_my_pebble_won.27t_connect.2C_keeps_disconnecting_itself.2C_or_my_battery_life_is_awful.3B_how_can_i_get_it_working_right.3F   I can't reply to text messages on my Pebble Time.

pebble,3djks7,Protonus,2,Thu Jul 16 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Well, the other two things should help your immediate concerns.  Once Pebble releases their Speech to Text API in their SDK which I imagine will happen in the next few month at most, we already know developers like the one making Smartwatch+ will update his app to utilize the mic.  Point being, even if Apple never stops being jerks to their endusers and never lifts their restrictions they placed on ANCS; or even if Pebble never figures out a way to work around Apple's shenanigans; the situation will still be improved by dedicated third party developers of apps like Smartwatch+ and by the jailbreak community.   So while I can't give you an exact date as you mention in your OP, I can nearly guarantee things will improve for iOS users in, the near future.  Whether that's a month from now or 6 I'm not sure.  As they say, where there's a will, there's a way."

Avoid using watch faces that have animations that run every second and if you have a face that requires frequent refreshes, try to keep it down to every 3-5 minutes at most. You'll still get lower battery life than the official estimates, but still within reason."
pebble,3dhh34,dezign999,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:08 2015 UTC,I only get about 3 to 4 days but I think in my case it is because I get a lot of notifications.  It would be nice if there was an app that would tell you if one of the apps was causing the drainage issue.
pebble,3dhh34,Montrof,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:05:14 2015 UTC,It takes about 4/5 days to get down to 20% at which point I usually charge it. I haven't timed it (will do next time) but it appears to take longer than the OG to charge.
pebble,3dhh34,mike_tree,0,Thu Jul 16 13:48:46 2015 UTC,"Coming from the Moto 360 I am loving the PT   Good to hear.   Of course I've been playing with it a lot so that could account for the drain   For sure.  That's pretty typical.   is it normal that it take maybe 30 minutes to go from 10% to fully charged?    Don't read much into percentages.  Think of them as relative indicators of charge, not an exact measurement, because they're not.  They're estimations based on voltage the battery is supplying, and how accurate it is differs from battery to battery.   In fact, when charging, you can ignore the percentage.  You want to charge the watch until the ""coffee cup is full and has it's lid snapped on"" and the watch says ""Fully Charged"", and the screen goes from red to green.  Only then, is it truly, 100% fully charged.  Because of these two facts, it may take just as long to go from 50% to 90%, as it does to go from 100% to fully charged.  Just keep charging, until it says fully charged (not 100%).  If you don't, you're not filling the battery to max capacity.   I'm kinda disappointed I can't go 3 days without having to charge it. Does anyone else experience the fast drain    The first issue may be, as noted, you might not be filling the battery to max capacity.

pebble,3dgi4j,sin2635,5,Thu Jul 16 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"Is it just me that finds it ludicrous that you need a protector for a watch? You don't see a guy with a standard wrist watch wrapping his in plastic to protect it. They should be designed to handle it fine.   I've had my PT on my wrist for over a month now, no scratches on the glass and only 1 tiny scratch on the bezel. I've scratched the bezel a few times, once quite deeply, but they all seem to have 'healed' by themselves. I work in IT so it gets plenty of knocks."

pebble,3dgi4j,mike_tree,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:42:40 2015 UTC,"Is it just me that finds it ludicrous that you need a protector for a watch? You don't see a guy with a standard wrist watch wrapping his in plastic to protect it. They should be designed to handle it fine.    Pebble is not a standard watch though, in several ways relevant to this conversation:   Most watches have the display and crystal recessed a bit.  On Time though, the crystal is flush with the bezel.   The crystal in Time is also curved convex.  This means you're even more likely to hit the center of the glass on stuff than if it was flat. Most higher end watches use sapphire crystal, but Time is using Gorilla Glass, which is considerably softer (and more easy to scratch).  Many more things will scratch Glass than Sapphire and less force is required to do so. Most watches have much smaller crystals than Time.  Time's crystal is double the size of the average digital watch crystal."
pebble,3dgi4j,Protonus,2,Thu Jul 16 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Ok. I don't think you're wrong on any of your points, but what I was getting at is should we consider that acceptable? Yes, it has more functionality than your everyday analogue wristwatch. But I don't think that should come at a price of less hard wearing materials."
pebble,3dgi4j,cameheretosaythis213,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"Using more premium materials like Sapphire would greatly add to the expense of the the Time, especially for a small company like Pebble.  Adding Sapphire to the Apple watch increases it's cost by $200, which is the price of the Pebble Time itself.   As for the design, I prefer Pebble Time's very thin, curved design, to one which would lose those aspects in order to better protect the crystal."
pebble,3dgi4j,Protonus,2,Thu Jul 16 16:14:56 2015 UTC,This comment explains and nails it perfectly.
pebble,3dgi4j,Bepple_your_Pebble,4,Thu Jul 16 23:36:10 2015 UTC,"I was babying mine, treating it like a newborn, and scratched it after 4 days. I was reaching to put on a seatbelt and a pocket clip from my flashlight cut into the bezel, and across the gorilla glass. Barely noticeable, but could have been much worse. I ordered a gadgetwrap with a clear protector that night, and put it on today.  I'd say get one. These things look way too good to have a blemished screen."
pebble,3dgi4j,legendofj,3,Thu Jul 16 03:24:10 2015 UTC,I have a gadget wrap covering the bezel because that will likely be the first thing to come into contact with something I may hit my hand/wrist/arm on as I walk by door knobs are my nemesis. I had a screen protector on it for a little bit but it annoyed me because it had a gap between the bezel skin and the clear protector. It's likely because of the way the screen and bezel aren't flush but it bothered me so I am going without one.
pebble,3dgi4j,Matt_StL,4,Thu Jul 16 03:19:24 2015 UTC,"That is up to you. If you are worried about scratches get a protector.  I have been wearing my own Pebble Time since June 1st, and I haven't gotten a single scratch yet. Others haven't been so lucky, but personally I like the look of the watch without skins or protectors so I will keep using it bare."
pebble,3dgi4j,almightywhacko,2,Thu Jul 16 03:53:59 2015 UTC,It will be when it scratches. I'd get one just in case.

I always had a bubble or an edge that was not correct and this was after 2 or 3 failed attempts and I threw away the mess ups.   The screen protectors will last a few months and I would replace them, the third and final round of wearing them I woke up with a screen protector stuck to the side of my bed and never replaced it.  I decided to go without and I happen to somehow put an “X"" scratch directly in the middle of the screen pictured below. The beauty of it though is I will never see the scratch 100 percent of the time, and only matters at a certain angle so its not a big deal.  At the end of the day I may get another screen protector I may not have enjoyed this watch for over a year and either way I'll still keep wearing it.  http://imgur.com/a/koFoq"

I noticed when iOS got 3.1 its patch notes said fixed Timeline pins not appearing for some apps. I had this problem with all but 2 of my apps that were supposed to place pins. I was bummed 3.1.1 didn't have it, even more bummed when 3.1.2 didn't either, I kept factory resetting, reconfiguring my apps, nothing worked.  Installed this, hadn't even bothered factory resetting, checked my Timeline, and everything was there! I got mine about 5 days after you guys started shipping them out so I've gone without full functionality for a while. Now it feels like a whole new device!"

pebble,3diuti,Protonus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"Why are you turning your bluetooth off at night?!    If this is for Pebble, you are creating battery drain on your Pebble by doing this.  If you don't to get notifications at night, either set your Pebble's automatic Do Not Disturb hours up on the watch, turn notifications off at night, or just simply turn off the watch.    Turning off Bluetooth is the wrong way to do any of that and can lead to all manner of technical issues as many companion apps will malfunction and error with bluetooth off, running your phone battery down too."

Charging overnight you know it'll be charged by the time you wake. Charging in the office during the day I wouldn't want to have to try to delve into menus to check the status (and risk dislodging the charge cable in the process and thus potentially causing it to look like it's full when it isn't or need additional charge when it doesn't). 3. Agree fully. I don't have an issue with the font size, it's fine for me. Better use of the icon area at the top of the notification would be nice.   Now mine,   4. User selectable auto-dismiss time for notifications. 5. Return of the ""Phone calls only"" notification mode - I'd like to suppress most notifications overnight but if calls come then notify me. It was a feature of the OG Pebble I think (from reading online) but is missing from the PT. 6.

I don't have to find the end of the cable and figure out the orientation. the PT charger kinda sucks, so a dock should help make sure it charges reliably.   a dock will also prevent the charge cable form being disconnected if you bump it. It also looks nicer.  That said, I have a 3d printer and just printed someone else's design. I spent maybe 10 minutes of my time and less than $1 of plastic."
pebble,3ddfbz,sinembarg0,2,Wed Jul 15 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"the PT charger kinda sucks, so a dock should help make sure it charges reliably.   Yeah, I agree.  I wish the contacts on the back were for smart straps only, and the charger port was on the side like the original Pebble.

I sleep in mine and use it as an alarm so it's only off my wrist twice a week for less than an hour.   It's based on usage. Just like any app or watchface a dock is a godsend for some and pointless for others.
pebble,3ddfbz,ContraVern,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:49 2015 UTC,If you are sitting front of computer it would be nice to be in dock and see time there.
pebble,3ddfbz,GMsupr,3,Wed Jul 15 12:08:51 2015 UTC,I have the time displayed on  my computer and on my wrist!
pebble,3ddfbz,O-2-L,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:41:43 2015 UTC,I always take off my watch and ring when I'm at the computer for any decent amount of time. It's just more comfortable for me.  Don't when if I'll get a dock for my time when it gets here though.
pebble,3ddfbz,AJ00TJ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:27:51 2015 UTC,"I don't sleep or shower or play basketball or work on my cars, or mow my yard with mine on. So a dock is quite a nice. Plenty of times i don't wear mine, especially on the weekends."
pebble,3ddfbz,Matt_StL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:35 2015 UTC,"For me its a ""nice to have"" but I'll also have a PT Steel and my OG Pebble so when I'm wearing one the others can sit on those things and be a little safer than just sitting on my dresser. Multiple watches were the only reason I decided to back TimeDock on Kickstarter."
pebble,3ddfbz,Protonus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:11:36 2015 UTC,"Why do I need a dock?   Well, you don't need a Pebble either.  But like the Dock, it's nice to have.  I previously charged my classic Pebble while I was wearing it at my desk.  Can't so much do that with Time, so I charge it on my desk.  But placing the watch on the charger so the weight is on the cable has a tendency to dislodge it particularly if you bump it.  My 3d printed dock (thread coming soon on this) holds the watch off the desk, holds the cable in place, and tips it 30 degrees so I can see it where I'm sitting so I can continue to use it to monitor notifications."

pebble,3dd43a,Protonus,5,Wed Jul 15 14:10:23 2015 UTC,"Paid for my Pebbles, two OGs for me and the girlfriend, and a PT for me. The team though is not worthy of such love. They were horrible at communication the first time around, and nearly as bad the second time. They retarded progress on the Android version of the watch software because of iOS restrictions, and only with the PT are they letting Android do more (no doubt due to the Apple Watch providing competition).   A company like Pebble should be more engaged with their community, before we get them cupcakes."
pebble,3dd43a,milan616,-4,Wed Jul 15 14:42:22 2015 UTC,"and nearly as bad the second time.   How so?  They have been giving us regular updates.  This is a ridiculous complaint. Do you want them to personally call you and chat about the status of your individual watch?    My god the sense of entitlement is astounding and truly depressing.   They retarded progress on the Android version of the watch software because of iOS restrictions   That is complete bullshit.  They have different teams working on different OS's and areas of the software.  This is literally not a thing.   only with the PT are they letting Android do more (no doubt due to the Apple Watch providing competition).    This doesn't even make sense.  It's wildly known and understood that the reason Pebble Time does more on Android is because it can. If they could do those same things on iOS they would, but Apple is responsible for making that currently impossible."
pebble,3dd43a,niggwhut89,2,Wed Jul 15 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"They made statements and then ignored any questions about them. Shiping order, production order, actual shipments. Pebble is shipping announcement, all the tech sites write up information. Except it didn't ship for a few more days and then only a small amount at first. They of course didn't let anyone know the iOS app wasn't out until enough of the backers who received their watches complained that they couldn't use their watches. They never want to admit when they mess up, most companies don't, but most companies don't depend so much on crowd funding and advertising. If they had released the watch via normal channels now that they're established they could communicate however they want. They didn't because they knew they'd never get the hype needed with a normal campaign. They depend on their community and failed to treat it well.   And the Android version could always do more. There were and still are far more hooks into the OS on Android than on iOS. The first gen always got features later on Android than it did on iOS. Sure, they've said the iOS team is larger than the Android team and maybe there are just that many more iOS users, but it's no excuse to not make the watch as useful as possible on Android. I'm actually happy they've stopped hamstringing it on Android."
pebble,3dd43a,Protonus,2,Wed Jul 15 18:17:03 2015 UTC,"Your fanboyism is glowing through yet again. It's far from a ridiculous complaint. If it were just a regular product launch, sure, it'd be ridiculous. However, they chose to crowdfund the watch again. Crowdfunding, by default, comes with greater expectations of communication than perpetual ""soon""s and a mere handful of single-angle real world pictures of sample devices halfway through the expected delivery month.  You failed to understand his statement. He's suggesting that Pebble are only now finally adding more native functionality to Android-paired Pebbles because the Apple watch's greater functionality poses a threat to their iOS market. By adding more functionality to Android, they partially mitigate this hit to their business. It's not a farfetched statement at all."
pebble,3dd43a,Protonus,0,Wed Jul 15 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"Your fanboyism is glowing through yet again   This is far from fanboyism, it's simple logic and understanding.

Crowdfunding, by default, comes with greater expectations of communication than perpetual ""soon""s and a mere handful of single-angle real world pictures of sample devices halfway through the expected delivery month.   And the regular, detailed updates aren't enough?   Again, they have been more than forthcoming, more so than most Kickstarter projects, and they have been well within reasonable timelines and their own projections.  Anyone who thinks they aren't is simply being self entitled and abusing their right to complain.     Pebble is a company. They're not your pen pal.  Expecting them to reply to every single request for a day to day update on the operations of the company is a ridiculous expectation.    They update us when they have something new to say.    If you backed Pebble on Kickstarter you should be thrilled with how quickly you received our reward, because it far exceeds the norm.   He's suggesting that Pebble are only now finally adding more native functionality to Android-paired Pebbles because the Apple watch's greater functionality poses a threat to their iOS market. By adding more functionality to Android, they partially mitigate this hit to their business. It's not a farfetched statement at all.   Except again, that doesn't make any sense at all.  We got Android Wear interaction on the classic Pebble, long before the Apple Watch was ever even demonstrated to the public, let alone released for Pre-order.  The only new / additional functionality that Time gives us Android users is the ability to do Voice Reply - which uses the exact same Android Wear functionality previously mentioned.  The only reason we couldn't do voice reply on classic Pebble is the obvious lack of a microphone."

Had a go with a 3M super fine sanding sponge and was pleased with the results.  I can't wait for this to get a little patina on it, its going to look even nicer :)"

pebble,3dg3ut,andysaurus_rex,-3,Thu Jul 16 00:24:28 2015 UTC,Also if I were you I would wait sitting for the new OS for the OG Pebble... Every time I ask Pebble about that update they just give me the random ASAP. I think they don't care about old customers as we don't drive money for them (in their mind) since there is no App Store with paid apps or anything like that. I'm also on the fence about selling my Pebble Steel because of not being updated to new OS.  I probably will get down-voted but that's just my opinion.
pebble,3dg3ut,silvetti,5,Thu Jul 16 08:43:49 2015 UTC,"You'll get the new OS when they've actually created it for the OG Pebble. Their priority, rightfully so, is to get Times and Time Steels out to backers as quickly as possible whilst ramping up production for pre-orders at the same time.   Patience is a virtue. Timeline will arrive to the Pebble and Pebble Steel when it's done, which, as they've said, will be later this year."
pebble,3dg3ut,terra4,-3,Thu Jul 16 10:31:44 2015 UTC,Right... Because all the devs are packing and putting together Pebble Times and going to USPS to ship them. For sure.

pebble,3ddgrc,aquariumboy,3,Wed Jul 15 12:18:56 2015 UTC,"What does ""support x"" means?  Can Pebble act as an iBeacon? Can it recognize iBeacons alone, without depending on the phone? Or does it just echoes the phone support for it?  I'd be surprised for the 2 first cases. Apple has been a lot intransigent and protective about other platforms embracing iBeacon. Besides, Pebble seems to be very conservative and constrained on the use of Bluetooth and the 2 first scenarios would probably be Bluetooth-heavy.  Now, if Pebble just shows notifications from an app in the phone recognizing the beacons then the support for Eddystone should be straightforward."
pebble,3ddgrc,diego_moita,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:02:35 2015 UTC,"What does ""support x"" means?   In this context it means 'support X in the same way you support Y'.  Eg; (read the link) Pebble does indeed act as an simple iBeacon, so will it also act as a Eddystone beacon in the same manner?  And no, it is not power/bluetooth heavy, in many ways the whole point of the beacon infrastructure is that the beacons have negligable power requirements and so can be built in a multitude of devices to advertise their presence."
pebble,3ddgrc,DeMoB,2,Thu Jul 16 11:30:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Pebble Time (currently?) supports the iBeacon feature.  In v2.2 it was only the ios app that acted as an iBeacon receiver. Firmware support was added to v2.5. The iBeacon was then used for the ""smartwatch proximity"" feature in the iOS app, allowing the phone to automatically relaunch the Pebble iOS app if it closed while the smartwatch was still in range. You can see the iBeacon working because the Pebble iOS app icon will be on the bottom left corner of your lockscreen with an OG pebble nearby/connected.  Based on the lack of a ""smartwatch proximity"" flipswitch, and the PT companion app no longer showing on the lockscreen, I don't believe the PT currently supports iBeacon.  So I strongly suspect this is either a feature that's not been deemed necessary for the PT, or (hopefully) is a low priority for porting over."

pebble,3dbal0,sirpaul589,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:51 2015 UTC,"If it's at customs, Canada Post tracking would say so.   No, it would not.  The customs office is not part of Canada Post and customs does not communicate the status of a parcel until they hand it over to CP.  It even says this on the Canada Post website regarding international packages:   Some items may be delayed if held by customs for additional inspection. Canada Post has no information on specific items awaiting customs inspection. Once an item clears customs, it is handed over to Canada Post for delivery. Delivery time depends on the product and the distance to its destination."
pebble,3dbal0,almightywhacko,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"Not true. It will say arrived in country and package is processing.

pebble,3d9h2q,matthews1977,2,Wed Jul 15 01:28:53 2015 UTC,"A screen protector may solve the problem; just make sure it's a liquid applied screen protector like Invisible Shield. When you apply the liquid that seals the protective plastic layer on top of the screen, it makes all of the foggy scratches vanish, similar to this video.   EDIT: Also, it appears that you may have a screen protector already on the watch. Peal that off and your problem will also be solved. If you're having difficulty removing it, use a piece of tape on top of the screen protector to get one of the corners going."
pebble,3d9h2q,Chronoraven,2,Tue Jul 14 15:52:09 2015 UTC,I'm using a gadget wrap protector which can be seen in the photo's. The effect is much worse without the protector. It makes it slightly more usable - but i'm still having to view the watch at un-natural angles to be able to see information clearly.
pebble,3d9h2q,Chronoraven,2,Tue Jul 14 15:58:18 2015 UTC,Just realized the GadgetWrap is liquid-applied. I thought that would help because I've had luck with this method in the past. I'm sorry it didn't work for you.

pebble,3d9h2q,Chronoraven,2,Tue Jul 14 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"ah. Well, you may have just buffed the coating on it causing it to cloud.

pebble,3d9h2q,cbigsby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:57:08 2015 UTC,You should try using a liquid-applied screen protector. The liquid will clear up the fog in between the layers by refocusing the light instead of scattering it; it's like a lens.

I remember when the OG Steel came out reviews pointed out how much nicer and crisper the screen was compared to the regular Pebble, despite the hardware being the same. A fairer comparison would be between the Time and an OG Pebble."

The Android Wear app is a (unnecessary arbitrary) requirement from Google, for some Google apps, like Hangouts, in order to ""unlock"" their full Android Wear actions (reply, etc) from Pebble.     No need to overthink this.  Just install the Android Wear app, and that's it. Don't even need to open it. Just have it on your phone."

pebble,3d7j8y,cazlar2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:12:16 2015 UTC,"Hi all, SongView has just been updated to take advantage of the colour screen on the Pebble Time.  Now you can see your album art in glorious 64bit 6-bit colour.  For the future: I'm still trying to improve the transfer speed a bit more (currently takes about 5 seconds or so, depending on the image) and I'm still playing with dithering (wasn't happy with it, so not enabled for this version).  NB This version is NOT backwards compatible - the new watchface requires the new iOS app and vice versa.  Edit: here's some images (sorry about the brick background, that was the only place I could get decent light at the time!) http://imgur.com/a/m6U12"
pebble,3d7j8y,ingrinder,2,Tue Jul 14 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"Now you can see your album art in glorious 64bit colour.   Not quite. I don't think 64-bit colour is even used anywhere at the moment because we don't require those amounts of precision.   Pebble Time uses 6-bit colour (in the display there are two subpixels of each colour), in comparison your computer monitor probably uses 24-bit colour (three subpixels that have ~24 levels of brightness each but don't quote me on that).  From this, you can either say, ""in 64 glorious colours"", or ""in glorious 6-bit colour)   Just a heads up."
pebble,3d7j8y,WesBur13,2,Tue Jul 14 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, sorry, you are completely correct! I meant 64 colors total, though to be perfectly honest I'm only technically using 63 (extra one currently [though unnecessarily in the end] reserved for use in compression algorithm)"

It cannot control, nor show album art/track info for any other apps, including Spotify. I would love to, but haven't found a good solution yet. I also haven't signed up to Apple Music yet so haven't tested if it works with streaming (but I'm guessing not, as the current APIs deal only with your music library)."
pebble,3d7j8y,neodraig,2,Tue Jul 14 04:01:54 2015 UTC,I just tested with Apple Music while streaming and it does not show the art work.
pebble,3d7j8y,PiwwowPants,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"Seems great for iOS users.  I'm on Android so I use Music Boss and there is a delay for the album arts to be displayed (first the old one is erased and then the new one is displayed, takes 2-3 seconds)  Is it the same thing with SongView of does the album arts appear instantly?"
pebble,3d7j8y,ingrinder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:17:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are limitations on how fast you can transfer stuff over bluetooth, so I think instantaneous is not likely to happen (not sure if they are different between iOS PebbleKit and Android though?).  Haven't timed exactly but album art takes about 5-6 sec or so for a complicated picture a, but due to compression if it involves lots of the same colour it is much faster (a few seconds). My compression is fairly basic, and I'm using the full 64 colours at the moment, so there is room to improve if I find a good way to dither down to 16 colours (i.e. should double speed roughly)"
pebble,3d7j8y,DuffyEvan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:09:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the answer.  Yeah I said 2-3 seconds but it can be longer on how complex is the picture. Also Music boss doesn't display the full cover (only 3/4 of the picture).  I just asked because I wondered if it was coming from the OS, the bluetooth or Music Boss. Now I have my answer, thank you."
pebble,3d7j8y,DuffyEvan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"For the transferring of images, it seems the way the WatchPop watchface gets around this is they load the image in black and white first because that loads a bit faster. Then they load up the color one in the background and show it when it is available. I would not be opposed to seeing this rather than the slow curtain-sliding loading of the color art work off the bat."
pebble,3d7j8y,DuffyEvan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:44 2015 UTC,WatchPop caches the last B&W image and displays it in colour once it has been fully downloaded
pebble,3d7j8y,PiwwowPants,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea, I'll consider it. Not sure keeping in a cache would be worthwhile for this use, as could only store a few images, but I think I could probably do the b&w first followed by colour fairly easily.  Edit: just played around with this a bit. Rather than sending B&W first, I've got it sending a low resolution colour bitmap that I blow up to full size. So now see (boxy) art in around a second, and then the details fill in. Feels faster at least ;-)"

It was designed that way.  If it doesn't, it's a defective watch.  The very first day i got mine, i went to the shower with it. If it is defective, better replace it sooner than later.  After 1 month my watch has been ~15 times in a pool while I was lap swimming and between 1-2 times a day under the shower (depending if i was swimming that day or not).  I even, while lap swimming, press the back button immediately after I hit the wall and raise my hand out of the water, to stop the swim.com app.  My watch is still perfect, and I expect it to stay like that until it dies from use (or I replace it with my PTS).

I'm not saying there's mass issues but there is definitely some kind of manufacturing problem (perhaps the seal is hard to install or the membranes are difficult to line up or the QA inspector is sleeping on the line during night shift) that is somewhat notable in the Kickstarter batch.

There is no such thing as a water proof watch. Only varying levels of water resistance.  Pebble is highly water resistant, but that doesn't mean you can use the buttons underwater.  Most water resistant watches are this way as well if you look into them, with this same disclaimer.   It was not designed to have the buttons actuated while submerged.  If you look at how it's designed this is evident.  Creating a button system that could be actuated underwater would increase the cost and size of the watch.   You should be able to use it as per normal and not worry   Normal usage does not include using the buttons submerged.   I've still got my old pebble and I use it normally when I swim, along with everyone else.   You weren't supposed to do it with your old Pebble either, if you read the link above.

I appreciate the support regardless :)

pebble,3d70uz,Pinkcheetah507,2,Tue Jul 14 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"I really wish PlexFit was for iOS. With the recent Misfit update, the syncing seems to be better and the sleep tracking is good, but the steps are very inaccurate which just messes up the tracking. PlexFit just seems like a better option overall."
pebble,3d70uz,Pinkcheetah507,3,Tue Jul 14 01:32:03 2015 UTC,"I too am having serious issues with the latest Misfit update. It is syncing using the new two-step select button method, but the data displayed on the Pebble and the phone app are not the same after a sync. And don't get me started on how the update destroyed the step-count accuracy. I used to be pretty happy with Misfit as far as set-counting but since the new update it grossly over-counts. I can clock 10,000 steps without leaving my desk, just typing for a few hours."
pebble,3d82re,fudgepuppy,3,Tue Jul 14 06:18:33 2015 UTC,Have you tried to turn off and then turn on the watch?  Have you tried to charge it again?

pebble,3da54y,carajean2725,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:54 2015 UTC,"Don't know about the shipping question, but on the 7 day battery life thing, it depends how you use it of course.  However, the general consensus seems to be that 7 days is a bit of an optimistic estimate, assuming you don't turn off the watch at night.    Based on forum reports, real-world usage rates seem to vary between 3 days (at the low end) and 5 days (at the higher end of average).  I've had my PT for about 3 weeks now and I'd say I consistently get about 4-5 days between charges, which I'm more than happy with."
pebble,3da54y,section23a,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:51:23 2015 UTC,Yeah that's not bad at all plus only 1 hour on the charger. I can do that every 4 says. I was looking for something I can wear to bed and not worrying about charging every morning.

pebble,3d8anq,derebanz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:57:09 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you. I read a post about a user who bent the connector between two permanent links to remove one, and then reattached that link to the last one with the removable pin. I'm afraid to try it though. If you attempt any modifications, can you make a video?"
pebble,3d8anq,blueknap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:08:21 2015 UTC,"So I actually tried this method out and got it to work. You can have a look at the end result here https://imgur.com/a/dOxcz.  It's not perfect but hey, it's better nothing (I guess it's a trade off that I was willing to make in exchange of the watch sliding around and annoying the hell out of me :p). That being said, you won't really notice it from afar. Perhaps if you have better skills than me, you could get it to look better. The method which I used to bend the hooks was rather rudimentary involving the flat head screwdriver which came with the steel band, my bare hands, a pair of tweezers and a bit of patience :). I did scratch the inner part of the hook of the 4th link a little but that doesn't really matter since nobody is gonna see that anyway once you are wearing the watch.  I did not take a video but I can detail the steps with some additional pictures if I have the time. Basically, it involved removing the 3rd link from the clasp which is why if you look closely (again not noticeable from far), the band doesn't taper off properly from what was originally the 4th link to the 2nd link."
pebble,3d8anq,blueknap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Haha I did this too! I made a video in case you wanted it. Why'd you do the third up though? I only did the second up, the next one past the one with the removable pin. Unfortunately this seems to be a little tight for my liking..."
pebble,3d8anq,blueknap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:27:35 2015 UTC,"I figured if you removed the 2nd link, you might have a hard time if you need to add back the additional removable links for whatever reason. Reason being if the hook is not bent back properly, you will have a hard time inserting the pin back for the removable link.  I also feel that the fit is kinda tight for me now. There really should be an easier way of micro-adjusting the size too haha. I've read about someone drilling holes in the clasp but I'm not good with that plus I don't have the equipment either :/"
pebble,3d8anq,Itsmyard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:48:50 2015 UTC,"To see about what length I like, I pulled the removable pin out of one link, so my band is roughly half a link longer. It fits perfectly. I'm going to have to find a new clasp or get holes drilled. I'm hoping to find a good jeweler this weekend. Keep me updated if you do anything, as will I. Thanks and good luck!"
pebble,3d8anq,andysaurus_rex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"You can check out etsy, many people create custom bands for you, you could see someone who creates metal bands, give them your wrist size and tell them to make it for the pebble steel."
pebble,3d8anq,iTokki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:49:26 2015 UTC,Hm that sucks. I have a medium sized wrist and took out 5 links. I don't think it's possible to take out more than they allow
pebble,3d8anq,blueknap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"The metal strap with all links removed was still too big for me too. What I did was get a metal clasp and some spring bars from eBay and swapped out the clasp with a much shorter clasp. With the clasp switched out, I had to remove all but one link."
pebble,3d8anq,iTokki,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:39:24 2015 UTC,Can you explain how to do this? I went to a jeweler and they said you couldn't switch the clasp out.
pebble,3d8anq,blueknap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"The clasp is just attached to the strap with regular spring bars. I just poked them out and switched the clasp out. However, the pebble clasp is actually two different sizes on either ends so I had to get an extra bigger spring bar for the replacement clasp to attach onto the strap. I don't remember if I did a 20mm or 18mm clasp; it doesn't say the size on my eBay history. You can probably just measure the strap lugs to figure out the sizing.  The jeweler probably said that because of the asymmetrical lugs of the pebble clasp, but just replacing it with a clasp the size of the bigger side works just fine. The smaller side might move around a bit, but it's not that noticeable."
pebble,3d8anq,iTokki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:45:25 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to the one you bought? Unfortunately I have a black one so I'll also have to try to find one that is close in color.

I loved it, it was a nice color and wanted to stay with you guys.  But with the line of work that I'm in it just didn't hold up.. It did its job and protected my watch, but dbrand from first touch just seemed better quality for what I do for work."
pebble,3d5lzn,Afinkawan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:20:17 2015 UTC,No worries at all. If you would have had carbon fiber from us it would have been the same thing. We both use 3M DINOC.
pebble,3d5lzn,megagoosey,2,Tue Jul 14 00:07:24 2015 UTC,Is there a reason that material can't be used across all styles?
pebble,3d5lzn,Nimiety_One,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"Because 3M DINOC (even though it comes in hundreds of different styles) is really hard to come by unless you are purchasing in ridiculous quantities. Even then you are at the mercy of what 3M is selling at any given time. Most of the styles are used in super high-end hotels and high-rise buildings as faux wood/metal finishes. The matte, gloss, and brushed wraps that we sell are either 3M or Oracal products (not DINOC), the carbon and wood are DINOC, and the designs/flags/elephant are printed on matte vinyl with 3M adhesive. Extremely long story short, our wood and carbon wraps are the same material as the wood and carbon wraps from SlickWraps and Dbrand and they are the most durable styles you can buy."

pebble,3d5jz6,WNJ85,5,Tue Jul 14 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Often times what is killing your battery is apps on your phone, not your watch.  If you've got apps installed for Pebble on your phone, that you're not using, uninstall them."
pebble,3d5jz6,Protonus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:12:00 2015 UTC,Why would apps on the phone cause the battery in the PT (or the phone) to be drained if they're not being actively used?
pebble,3d5jz6,AlecEdworthy,4,Mon Jul 13 21:31:49 2015 UTC,"Because they can still send app messages to the watch, expecting a reply from their watch app, utilizing the bluetooth connection of the watch, running it's battery down.  In fact, a companion app can also malfunction when it's not getting the reply it expects such as the watch app not being there at all, and run the battery down in just a day or two from that alone.  Notification Center had this exact bug for quite a while (I don't know if it still does) and was the cause of many users excessive battery usage on their watch, including my own.  All that was needed to cause it was having the app on your phone, but not your watch.  Either way, the overall lesson here is don't keep apps on your phone or watch that you don't use or have no intention of using.   This doesn't just apply to Pebble, but really any device."
pebble,3d5jz6,Protonus,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"I get about 6 days out of my Pebble Time, and I don't do anything special.

pebble,3d5jz6,martinderm,2,Mon Jul 13 19:22:05 2015 UTC,Sleep as Android is a major battery drain from my tests. It streams raw accelerometer data over bluetooth throughout the night and it tends to deplete battery very fast.

pebble,3d5jz6,2realNOT4real,2,Mon Jul 13 21:35:17 2015 UTC,"My first charge (not even a full charge) got 5 days. Next full charge got 3.5 days. Charge after 2.5. I was using Star Trek v3 originally as my watch face and the first drop you see in there was a shift to using slides of time. The drop after that was changing from misfit to plexfit for activity tracker.  Honestly, it doesn't bother me. But I think, it's certainly misleading for them to keep spouting the battery time as a major feature as they have been."
pebble,3d5jz6,venerablemonster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:37:24 2015 UTC,"considering the other smart watches last no more than a day even with limited use, i think ""up to 7 days with limited use"" is more than fair"
pebble,3d5jz6,iggloovortex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:48:55 2015 UTC,"I get 5.5 days pretty consistently if I use a non-animated face and avoid heavy (e.g. more than a few minutes every couple hours) app usage for at least 4.5 of those days. That is to say, my last 2 charges lasted that long with 1 day of heavy app use and an animated face updating several times per second. The heavy-usage days accounted for 40% of battery usage for each of those charge cycles so, without that excessive usage I'd have been able to expect something closer to 7.5-8 days. That's with backlight and motion tracking enabled.  Mind you, I was getting ~2 days out of the box, with the same usage habits, until I did this: https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/3b8fhf/potential_fix_for_short_battery_life/"

I figured I'd at least have info on the PTS by now, but radio silence for weeks has made me concerned.  To avoid going watch-less (the Pebble has me hooked on smart watches) I walked into my Apple Store and bought one of their watches. Now I have 2 weeks to decide whether to return the Apple Watch or sell the PTS, whenever it may come.  I feel like I'm cheating on Pebble, but that's the downside of having a slow go in production.

Anyways the pebble times battery life is great. Yes you can use your own image as a watch face. Yes you can swap out the bands. I use a Fossil Band on my pebble. If you want a compatible band with the pebble time just search for a band that is 22mm in size. It is compatible with iphone no worries they just released their app in the app store and it is definitely great for music controlling. You can change the track back and forth and adjust the volume.

pebble,3d56w1,PiwwowPants,2,Mon Jul 13 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think the closest we have is that Apple is opening up their quick reply system to developers finally. I am not sure if that happened yet, when it will happen, and to what extent.

pebble,3d56w1,Gilesmartin,4,Mon Jul 13 18:24:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I am not going to lie to you... I think you will be very unhappy with the PT compared to the Apple Watch. I had the original pebble, the pebble steel, and even backed the PT. The apple watch simply runs circles around it. The activity tracking on the AW is phenomenal and blows pebble out of the water (all the pebble activity apps are terrrible - i ended up strapping a fitbit onto my watchband). The apps are much more capable and usable on AW even with the current OS limitations. Siri voice control and dictation are phenomenal. I can even reply to a text message in a crowded bar. going for a run with only my watch and a pair of BT headphones is awesome. Yes I have to charge it at night but I have never once gotten to the end of the day with less than 30% battery life even after waking at 6am and staying out until 2am the next day.  PS: bring on the down votes"
pebble,3d56w1,Nimiety_One,3,Mon Jul 13 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"Nah no downvotes, at least from me. I view the PT and AW as each having their own uses and not as direct competitors, both fill niches for different types of users.   OP sounds like he'd be ok with a PT, as his fitness tracking doesn't sound like it needs to be as accurate as possible (and with the Mario love the nerdy appeal of the PT seems to fit), however the sleep tracking could be an issue. Agree with your points, not sure if AW is fine for OP but that's just me; sleeping with a watch on has never been my thing, I'd rather do a fitness band."
pebble,3d56w1,Digitalchicanery,3,Mon Jul 13 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"A PT isn't as accurate as a dedicated health tracker (a la Fitbit) - However, it's ""good enough"" for most people who aren't running marathons.  I'm on iOS and love my PT - I wouldn't wear an Apple Watch if you bought one for me.  Right now the PT and iOS are a little buggy on music controls, but I assume this will be fixed soon as it isn't an issue with the first gen.  You'll be happy with the Time."
pebble,3d56w1,kidjudge,3,Mon Jul 13 17:17:17 2015 UTC,No 2 way notifactions
pebble,3d56w1,Protonus,2,Mon Jul 13 18:17:31 2015 UTC,What does 2 way notifications mean? Is that when you get the notification and then reply using the microphone?
pebble,3d56w1,section23a,2,Mon Jul 13 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"Not just the microphone, but any sort of interaction.  For instance, on Android (4.3+), when you receive a notification from any app that has Android Wear support, you get a Reply action to the notification, for which you get a choice of a Text reply (using canned preprogrammed text responses you can customize in the Pebble app), or you can reply with one of Pebble's built in emoji, or you can reply via Voice with the Mic.  However, even beyond these 3 Reply options, apps can provide further Android Wear interactions.  For instance, the Google Now app has a ""Navigate"" option for ""Time to Work/Home"" cards that can notify you.  Gmail has an Archive and a Star option.  It is these sort of interactions that you can't do on iOS with Pebble currently.  All you can do is Dismiss a notification (to clear it on your phone)."
pebble,3d56w1,Ptizzl,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:30 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth (and this isn't directly answering your questions, as others have already done so), it depends what you want to use your pebble time for.  I have an iPhone 6.  I love customizing faces, I love having long battery life, and my primary use is receiving notifications (so it doesn't really matter to me that that I can't reply via Pebble, and I'm not holding out hope that apple will let them implement that feature).  I also don't really care about fitness tracking.  Given that those are my primary uses, my pebble time does basically everything I need it to do, and it doesn't feel ""crippled"" to me, even though I know it would do more if I had it paired with an android phone.    The kicker to all this is I have an apple watch and used it every day for almost 2 months before I got my pebble time.  Even though my apple watch does technically do quite a bit ""more"" than my pebble time, my pebble time has replaced it almost completely.  This is because my pebble time 1) does what i need it to do and 2) does it well with minimal hassle, so I don't miss the extra features of the apple watch.  In the end it comes down to personal preference though!"

pebble,3d4z1e,filmerdanny,5,Mon Jul 13 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"YOU MUST DO THIS EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO SYNC YOUR DATA ONTO THE iOS APP.   Simply not true.  Once you've successfully established a link to Misfit by pressing the center button on the watch, the watch will auto sync your activity at some interval unbeknownst to the general public.  It's great that you found something that works, but to be realistic, it was likely only a few of these steps that  solved your issue.  My guess is it goes something like this:   Unload the app from your Pebble Remove the pebble device from ""My Devices"" in the iOS app Reload the Pebble app and authenticate. Press the center button on the Pebble Launch the iOS app and sync"

When I tap on Sources in Health, I see Misfit, but after tapping on it, there are no options to select at all, just a blank page.  I have a ticket open with Misfit but haven't heard back yet."

The leather band, the steel band, and a SHANK silicone band. None of them fit me perfectly like I've been able to get on other watches in the past. If I was able to swap with one of those bands I'd be really happy, but I'm not going to shell out $40 for the steel connect so I'll have to deal with it.   The color screen is also really nice and something I feel like I'm missing out on. There are certain watch faces that I'd rather use, but look like trash on a B/W screen. I bought my Steel for $160.

pebble,3d2wn0,andysaurus_rex,3,Mon Jul 13 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Have under cabinet speakers. Some days I get lucky and it plays my type of music, but last week it was playing Russian passion songs."
pebble,3d2wn0,simcowking,2,Mon Jul 13 03:51:43 2015 UTC,Don't you tell it what to play? Maybe I'm misunderstanding what exactly I'm looking at. Is this not just a Bluetooth speaker?

pebble,3d2wn0,andysaurus_rex,5,Mon Jul 13 04:17:17 2015 UTC,Imagine Pandora but it's not based on what you thumbs up but instead what it decides was pleasing. Like when it is the cleanest it'll play those songs again to simulate the mood that you last cleaned in. But when you're cooking it senses the heat and changes to more of a cooking music mood. It's quite futuristic!

I'd try this but I'm on iOS. Is there any chance that PlexFit will become cross-platform?  My ideal solution is one that could cross check against iOS's HealthKit and sort of ""fill-in-the-blanks"" for times HealthKit is missing and at the same time try and reconcile with the times that HealthKit has data for.  That's ideal though.  Brought to you by twenty steps while typing his message from a chair."

pebble,3d1e37,SirFadakar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:18:55 2015 UTC,IIRC the accelerometer placement on the board is different for the plastic versus steel. Meaning rotations of your wrist will result in different readings from the accelerometer depending on which pebble model you are using.  Would be pretty awesome if the steps algorithm took the watch model into account.

pebble,3d0kma,TrueJournals,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"Ah! I downloaded the watch and now all makes sense.  There was one bit of information I was missing: the colors of the squares on the inside.  These add to the minutes when they're colored white.  I believe this screenshot shows the four colored white, which makes the time 5:19:55.  The image on the appstore shows a bit more clearly:  Red blob = hours = 7 Snake = 2 = 10 minutes Inside squares = 3 = +3 minutes (13 minutes after the hour total) Q*BERT = 9 = 45 seconds  Gives a time of 7:13:45 (AM or PM)  It's still unclear to me if there's an AM/PM indicator on this watch or not."

pebble,3d1cc4,almightywhacko,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:55:20 2015 UTC,"Because its what everyone suggests. I personally used amazon for the screen protector since for the same price(10 dollars) I get 6 vinyl screen protectors, while at gadgetwraps, I only get 2. The quality is probably of little difference(mine work perfectly, and the clarity is barely affected), and with prime I get free shipping and it comes here in literally 1 or 2 day, vs about a week or so if I bought with gadget wraps.  I'll most likely buy from gadgetwraps for their skin for the metal portion of the pebble, its fairly cheap, and theres not really a good selection on amazon."
pebble,3d1cc4,dombeef,2,Sun Jul 12 19:31:43 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I plan to do. I ordered skinomi screen protectors because I have prime. Once I feel like changing the bezel or covering the scratches its bound to get I'll go with gadgetwraps.

If you got a brushed one that's probably the difference. If you got anything from us other than carbon or wood (also DINOC) and then got carbon, wood, or brushed from SlickWraps then that is the difference.

pebble,3d1cc4,tinyant,3,Mon Jul 13 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"If you only buy 1 individual wrap, yeah. The S&H is per order, since they can stuff a bunch of wraps/button wraps/screen protectors into 1 envelope. (I always appreciate a company that charges shipping reasonably.)  I'm not getting defensive, I just really don't think $5 is all that outrageous. You probably could find a sticker for $1 or whatever, but they would probably not be nearly as good (peeling, etc). I mean, you do you and all that, but I think it's a pretty reasonable price."

I've been lying in bed for the past few hours, just reading, and I've somehow racked up 1900 points.  It's also no longer syncing any data to Apple Health.  Finally, there were the problems even getting the new Misfit app to acknowledge the Pebble.  One step forward, two steps back.  (disclaimer: I'm using the iOS 9 beta, but have seen more than enough reports from people not using the beta to be certain this is a problem with Misfit, not iOS)"

pebble,3d126z,rhysmorgan,3,Tue Jul 14 02:44:04 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating, because I bought the Pebble over a Fitbit or a Jawbone primarily because it could do the fitness/movement tracking, the sleep tracking, AND the general notifications + smartwatch stuff, while having the same kind of battery life.  But my Pebble doesn't reliably do any of the fitness/movement/sleep tracking stuff, and I feel kinda cheated. Much as I do like my Pebble for the other uses... there are devices that do the smartwatch stuff better for me (as an Apple user) and devices that do the fitness stuff better for everyone.  I knew I wasn't getting a super-high tech Apple Watch when buying the Pebble, and that was a tradeoff I was OK with. I saw the Pebble as a fitness tracker with additional smartwatch features, but it's not, and that makes me frustrated and sad."

pebble,3d126z,joemerlino,2,Mon Jul 13 00:13:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info on morpheuz. I read about it but having to get morpheuz plus buy smartwatch pro separately then trying to make them work together including having to initialize it by doing a manual export of my sleep data doesn't seem very user friendly.  I wish there was just an all-in-one app that could monitor sleep and also sync to apple health. I can't figure out why all the sleep monitor apps don't just support it already and why the ones that did no longer do? It seems like that function wouldn't be terribly difficult to implement? Ok I'm done ranting.
pebble,3d126z,joemerlino,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:08:17 2015 UTC,In this case misfit is the one you're looking for. The app on the pebble syncs with the misfit app on iOS that talks directly to health kit so after the sync if you open up Health you'll find out your sleep tracking or steps taken.
pebble,3d126z,joemerlino,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:51:42 2015 UTC,Misfit used to do that but since the new updates it only syncs steps :(  http://imgur.com/CX1bvFi

You can change backlight to on to works on all kind of external light.  If your settings is ON and don´t work you have a problem and must contact Pebble support (I'll try first a factory reset)

The menus have also been freezing whenever I select or scroll through. The home button was unaffected.  That was up until now.

Since Pebble only supports one iOS app at a time to communicate with the watch, you need to quit all other apps as long as you want to use Smartwatch+. Once you used a different app, you can re-establish Smartwatch+' connection by toggling the ""Connect/Disconnect"" button inside its iOS app. iOS kills Smartwatch+ while it's running in the background. Smartwatch+ has to be running in the background in order to communicate with the watch. Technically, the jailbroken version should not be killed by iOS, since it runs with system privileges, but many people use InfinityTask to increase the reliability of Smartwatch+ running in the background."

pebble,3czkwo,lanathel,2,Sun Jul 12 12:06:10 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, they all have the same functionality, more or less. I cant speak for other developers, but if you are using BusPath, it is being updated at the moment (I know the dev).   It is really a matter of personal preference, I guess. (: That said, WMB? relies solely on the data provided by LTA, with no 3rd party backend, allowing it to function as reliably as LTA can provide. That said, it would mean that any changes in bus services will be updated corresponding without you having to do anything.

When I do that, the watch stated sync complete, but the Android app didn't change. It wasn't doing that this morning when it successfully synced steps I'd taken.  The last steps activity that synced was around 10 hours ago at 11am. I also set it to sync food I eat and have logged in MyFitnessPal. That logged breakfast, snacks and lunch, but not dinner.... everything up to around 2pm  As others have had the same issues on iOS I'd guess that Misfit underestimated demand and are having server issues?"

pebble,3cvofl,duduwongjowo,4,Sat Jul 11 06:55:41 2015 UTC,"Yes the lack of glare is great, but I can't see anything in low light without touching the light button. Like indoors during the day away from the window, I can't just glance at it. It might as well show nothing. My PT is perfect for me though as I just care about the notifications anyway. I wish it had a dedicated light button, all the buttons that give light also do something when you are in an app so when the 3 seconds are up, shits fucked."
pebble,3cvofl,swartkrans,2,Sat Jul 11 06:43:18 2015 UTC,I only get glare from interior lighting.  One thing that helped me with the indoor display being dim was the right watch face. I currently use Shadow with a white background and any color shadow. It's a very simple watch face but if it might help you enjoy your watch more.  Hopefully they will have some settings for the back light in a later software release and maybe if contrast settings exist for the e-paper LCD displays we'll get those too.  You should be able to shake the watch to activate the back light unless you turned this feature off. Give it some time I initially was very concerned but that has since faded. Cheers!
pebble,3cvofl,Matt_StL,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:56:20 2015 UTC,Pebble really needs to do something about that 3 second timeout. Should have an option in the settings to customize it or dedicated light toggle button as you said.
pebble,3cvofl,ImmortalSlacker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:51:54 2015 UTC,I don't see why it needs a dedicated light button. What's with with shake for light?  I like being able to activate the light without needing to use my other hand...
pebble,3cvofl,niggwhut89,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:53:45 2015 UTC,False positives throughout the day resulting in worse battery life.
pebble,3cvofl,wolfcry0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:04:04 2015 UTC,The motion shake for light is good for quick glances but the issue is when trying to read a notification message at night; the backlight goes out in 3 seconds and you have to keep shaking your wrist. Not the biggest deal but could be improved.
pebble,3cvofl,esjay,2,Sun Jul 12 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"The sun is behind it, wouldn't it need to be the other way around to get glare?"
pebble,3cvofl,Freshyfreshfresh,4,Sat Jul 11 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"Great, but wouldn't the glare only really happen if you reflected the light source (e.g. sun) in the watch face?"

pebble,3cvc1b,WizardBeaver,7,Sat Jul 11 02:05:25 2015 UTC,The bezel scratching is definitely an issue at least with the kickstarter watches. In terms of other build issues I they seem to be in the scope of normal manufacturing defects. They might have rushed quality checks just a bit to meet the demands of the super successful kickstarter will still making their retail date. But they're great about RMAs.
pebble,3cvc1b,Bishma,3,Sat Jul 11 04:00:40 2015 UTC,Yeah second this....I had the watch less than an half day before I accidentally scratched the paint on the bezel.  Ridiculous.
pebble,3cvc1b,leppardfan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:05:25 2015 UTC,"I had similar, but after that my bezel has suffered significant abuse and doesn't show even a ding. The original scuff is still there, but not incredibly easy to see unless you're trying to find it.   I'm wondering if it was such an issue because his quickly they were going from factory to shipping. I guess it just seems like after it settled it's been fairly tough, I've definitely whacked it harder than I did for the first scuff."
pebble,3cvc1b,Beefki,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Yep just wore it today for the first time, scratched it while waiting in line holding my son. Tapped the railing with my wrist. Only my scratch is blatantly obvious."
pebble,3cvc1b,Ptizzl,7,Mon Jul 13 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't had an OG, but I can speak to the PT. I had similar concerns about scratches and other issues, so I ordered a Gadgetwrap for the outer bezel and put it on immediately. The bezel wrap does have small, barely visible scratches, which makes me glad I got it since I suspect those scratches would otherwise be on the bezel.   As for the screen, I don't have a protector and it already has one tiny scratch (about 2 weeks in) at the top edge. I have no idea where it came from, and other times where I actually noticed that I bumped the screen or dropped a heavy glass jar on it, it didn't scratch. Go figure.  It is very small, but it bothers me a little.   I've had no issues with leaking and I've showered with the watch multiple times. I haven't submerged it.   My buttons are working fine.   The screen is straight and installed correctly in the housing.   So with a bezel wrap and no screen protector, my one complaint about 2 weeks in is a small scratch on the glass. No other build quality issues here, but YMMV. Hope that helps."
pebble,3cvc1b,dubyrunning,2,Sat Jul 11 02:59:12 2015 UTC,I've had my PT for just over a month. No scratches any where. Buttons are good and clicky.   The screen on mine is misaligned though but I'm in contact with pebble support. Waiting for my replacement to ship. I get to keep my charging cable so that's cool.
pebble,3cvc1b,shupershu,2,Sat Jul 11 08:53:26 2015 UTC,"I've had my White PT for about a month now and there are no scratches or any other problem. I may be in a minority here, but from my point of view the build quality is actually quite good."
pebble,3cvc1b,wreckyCZ,2,Sat Jul 11 12:45:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough responses everyone. I was starting to get a little worried over the build quality of the PT after reading complaints about mushy buttons among others. These responses have really instilled more confidence in the build quality of the Pebble Time and I'll definitely be getting one soon.
pebble,3cvc1b,spheredick,2,Sat Jul 11 15:20:20 2015 UTC,"What I would like to know is how much of a difference in build quality is there between the OG Pebble and the Pebble Time?   The Pebble Time is unquestionably sturdier than the OG Pebble.  I've been wearing mine unprotected for a month with no obvious damage.  I have some minuscule have-to-hold-the-watch-at-just-the-right-angle scratches on the glass, but they're usually invisible unless I'm looking for them.  My OG Pebble had a screen-marring scuff within a week.  That said, the coating on the bezel is probably the weakest point.  For now, I'm just rocking the watch unprotected, but if I get a noticeable mark on the glass or bezel I'll just slap a protector on it (and/or sand the whole bezel down for a plain stainless steel look -- someone did this and it looked nice).  A bezel protector won't affect screen visibility (and I suspect the screen is more durable), and if I need a screen protector it will probably hide light scratches (my OG's screen protector hides my scuff 100%)."
pebble,3cvc1b,almightywhacko,2,Sat Jul 11 05:41:48 2015 UTC,"The build quality of the Pebble Time is superior to that of the OG Pebble. People come to forums to complain when something goes wrong, they rarely come to post about how their device is working as expected. The defect rate for PT isn't any higher than for the OG Pebble, and is probably lower since the PT doesn't suffer from screen glitching."
pebble,3cvc1b,whatisdelicious,0,Sat Jul 11 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to just discount people's experiences because they're complainers or whatever. There are tons of positive posts on here about ""my battery is still going 9 days in"" and ""[rant] I fucking love my Pebble Time,"" etc. There's tons of that. But not everybody's experience has been positive, and it's shitty to be dismissive to those people just because it doesn't line up with the narrative around here that the Pebble is the only smartwatch worth owning.  Personally, I had a bezel wrap and screen protector on right when I got mine, but there's a piece of dust under the screen and they're sending me an RMA watch, so I decided to take the wrap and protector off since I'm sending it in anyway. No scratches on either just yet, but I'm going to the beach today so we'll see how well it holds up. I don't plan on putting a wrap or protector on my new watch.  However, the down button on this watch has definitely gotten mushy. I hope people are correct in saying that they rushed manufacturing on the Kickstarter run.  But for OP, I'd say you probably don't need to worry too much."
pebble,3cvc1b,almightywhacko,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Who is discounting anything?  The simple fact is that more people seek out forums when they have a problem with their device than if their device is working fine. You see this on every single forum dedicated to some kind of gadget, and the effect is more pronounced the more complicated the gadget is. On this sub some people have taken to creating the opposite style post praising Pebble simply to help balance the negative impression new visitors might get by seeing all the complaints.  And I stand by my first statement, the Pebble Time's build quality is superior to that of the OF Pebble. I currently own 4 of the OG Pebbles and at least one of every other watch Pebble has released. I like them all for different reasons, but the Pebble Time is significantly better than the OG.  I have been wearing my own Pebble time for almost 6 weeks now. I don't have a wrap or skin on it and it hasn't gotten scratched or dinged. I have worn it while doing yard work, fixing my car, do home repairs, etc. I haven't been gentle with it and while I have seen a lot of people post photos of scratches or whatnot I don't think that people experiencing this problem represent a large number of Pebble Time users."

I wish I got a gadget wrap but I can get over the scratches."
pebble,3cvc1b,duckmuffins,0,Sat Jul 11 05:44:35 2015 UTC,"I have a Time and I put just a screen protector that I got from Amazon on it. I left the bezel unprotected. I went to the beach and used it, swam in the pool with it afterwards and didn't end up with any scratching, just minor scuffs on the bezel. Not even visible. I would however get a bezel and screen protector anyway just in case. One of the reasons I'm currently selling mine is because I don't need it or use it as much as I thought I would, one reason being I have an iPhone so I have reduced functionality anyway."
pebble,3cvc1b,Spyderveloce,0,Sat Jul 11 06:17:23 2015 UTC,"I've had my Kickstarter edition PT since the beginning of June.  Functionally, I feel like there is a lot of thought and quality that went in.  I have yet to have the buttons feel mushy, my charger is fine (though some have had issues), I take mine in the pool at least 2 times a week with no issues.  The only issue I've had is the screen and bezel scratching.  I've been outspoken on this before and this is not the thread to have any arguments about it, but I have a suspicion that, during the manufacture process, they may have swapped out the Gorilla Glass they claimed to be using during the Kickstarter with something less durable, possibly to meet deadlines.  My first query to Pebble about the face materials yielded a stock response that didn't answer my question.  My second query was much more direct, asking is it or isn't it Gorilla Glass and, thus far (a week later), has had no response.  Corning provided a simple email stating that they are unable to discuss any products that are not already on the Corning Gorilla Glass website, even if they don't contain Gorilla Glass.  I love my PT, and will continue to, but have doubts about some of the materials that went into it, therefore, I feel that there is a build quality issue that cannot be ignored."
pebble,3cvc1b,Protonus,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:18:53 2015 UTC,"As was explained to you prior (and re-explained here for those reading along) - Gorilla Glass can and does scratch - by anything that was harder than it - from simple sand, to concrete, and so on.     It is not a wonder material.  The point of Gorilla Glass (versus normal soda lime glass) is mainly to resist shattering, not scratching.  The coating placed on Gorilla Glass is largely what is responsible for that scratch resistance, not the glass itself - which is why screen protectors are still recommended for anything with Gorilla Glass if you're going to try and scratch it.  Gorilla Glass is simply a brand name of fortified glass made thru an ion exchange process.  The differences between ""versions"" of Gorilla Glass largely relate to how thinly it can be made for a given strength.  The scratch resistance of ion exchange glass is largely identical across any type - regardless if it is Gorilla Glass or not.  I understand you're frustrated that you scratched your Pebble Time, but calling Pebble liars because you fail to understand the actual specifications of the material used and what their limitations are; is not a build quality issue."
pebble,3cvc1b,Spyderveloce,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"I refuse to argue this point in this thread with you, because, as I've stated this is not the thread for that.  On top of that, you blindly state that I'm calling them liars when I have done no such thing.  I have only expressed suspicions and opinions that have yet to be proven.  You let me worry about proving my suspicions and you can continue believing everything you read."
pebble,3cvc1b,Protonus,-1,Mon Jul 13 15:19:00 2015 UTC,"as I've stated this is not the thread for that.   Nor is it the thread to make baseless accusations that Pebble isn't using the materials they say they are, because you don't understand the materials in question.   I have only expressed suspicions and opinions that have yet to be proven   If you suspect that they are not telling the truth, which is what you are asserting, than yes, you are calling them liars; that's what that means.   You let me worry about proving my suspicions   Until you have proof, you should stop spreading this conjecture.  You are creating a baseless rumor whose source is nothing other than the fact that you don't understand what Gorilla Glass is."
pebble,3cvc1b,Spyderveloce,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"Let's agree to disagree.  Others have the right to evaluate the ""conjecture"" for themselves and offer up their own opinions whether they agree or disagree.  I haven't yet accused anyone at Pebble of any type of subterfuge, merely voiced my suspicions, which are just that.  The day I outright state that ""This is NOT Gorilla Glass!"", feel free to go on another rant about me not knowing what I'm talking about.  Edited for clarity:  The difference between suspicion and accusation is the level of certainty.  I did not accuse anyone of lying, nor do I suspect anyone of lying.  I suspect that there may have been a substitution during the setup of the manufacture process that backers may not have been made aware of.  There may not have been any ill intent on the part of pebble and I don't currently accuse them of any."

pebble,3cu243,andysaurus_rex,2,Fri Jul 10 20:15:06 2015 UTC,"Coming from a Steel myself, I'd say that it's so, so much different. The Steel was a metal box (but I still loved it!) sitting on my wrist. The time is a durable plastic and is curved to fit on the wrist so much better, and it is a lot lighter, which means it doesn't slide down your wrist (that was an issue with me, it would slide down my wrist and I did not like that). The band is AMAZING. Coming from my old link band on my Steel, this thing is incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. I would recommend it."

I don't normally care about any particular brand of anything but I'm happy to be a customer of these guys for life. Thanks!

pebble,3ctyop,Ticallion_Stallion,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:42:36 2015 UTC,Awesome indeed. I only asked them if I might have done something wrong and they offered a refund right away. The protector takes away the natural anti-glare of the Time and makes a bit harder to see. I'm happy with a bit of glare over scratches so I did not take the refund. Their stuff is awesome and they said improvements are being made. My OG Pebble wrap lasted almost a year before starting to peel.

pebble,3csyu7,andysaurus_rex,2,Fri Jul 10 18:32:16 2015 UTC,Yeah but honestly you're not at much of a risk anyway. Don't let it bother you if you get down to 20% or so. Even going dead a few times isn't bad

pebble,3csyu7,PebbleAppStoreBot,4,Sat Jul 11 04:04:37 2015 UTC,"My gmail inbox is filtered so I only get notifications for important stuff, everything else I just check a few times a day and I dont have my work email on my phone, I wanna leave that shit there. As for the rest it depends on the day. I sometimes get lots of snapchats/fb notifications, I sometimes don't. Depends on the day. I also muted messenger by accident and havent unmuted it yet so that reduces a lot of notifications.   I also rarely have time to reply to notifications at work unless they important (most are not). I work in a lab and you very often dont want to go through the whole ordeal of taking gloves off, washing hands, getting phone out, replying, putting gloves back on. So I often ignore things.   That is one of the huge benefits of a pebble actually. I can see if something is important without contaminating my phone. I can even use it without touching it by pressing the buttons through my labcoat."

pebble,3ct0zr,oneyozfest182,7,Fri Jul 10 19:45:47 2015 UTC,Me too. Dying would probably allow me to take a half day.

pebble,3cvgmw,c_ronic,2,Sat Jul 11 02:48:15 2015 UTC,I have not had any of these issues yet. Have you configured them in the pebble time app?
pebble,3cvgmw,tecrogue,2,Sat Jul 11 02:51:17 2015 UTC,I have tried everything.

pebble,3cvgmw,Protonus,2,Sat Jul 11 03:50:54 2015 UTC,"Yea I tried playing with that, Battery+ has been the one selected for a while now. Not sure if that affected the other apps. I know the Shows app does not have the option in Activity."
pebble,3cvgmw,Protonus,2,Sat Jul 11 04:02:52 2015 UTC,"I understand you and I think the same about Pebble's apps. The entire ecosystem is funny but a lot of applications are not reliable. The fitness band takes a bunch of steps while we are doing some stuff with our hands, Pebble's fitness apps calculate a step every single movement of our wrist and it isn't good. Other weather apps doesn't update properly, and so on."

pebble,3cwj63,Nedks,3,Sat Jul 11 11:18:55 2015 UTC,Leather is a product to be cared for. Treat it with a care product regularly that offers repellent qualities and pick the strap that suits you best.

pebble,3cwj63,Protonus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:59:15 2015 UTC,Not sure.
pebble,3cwj63,Protonus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"Leather isn't waterproof.  You need to look for a different material.   If you're looking to repeatedly expose it to water, Silicone (like Shank) is your best bet by far.    You could also use metal, paracord, nylon, perlon, or rubber - but any of these materials will degrade with time with repeated exposure to water. They won't clean as easily, may develop a smell or bacteria, etc."
pebble,3cu71z,shindrichs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:28:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. I think that pebble is missing a good weather app. The app itself is very beautiful as well.
pebble,3cu71z,Spaghetti-A-Plenty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:19:21 2015 UTC,"I think the Pebble is missing a good weather app too. I think they have lots of weather apps that look really nice (Precisioneer) but they are either powered by OpenWeatherMap, they are missing the weekly forecast or they don't cache the weather and need to reload after every screen change.  Forecast Weather App is the best I can find but I wish it looked more like Precisioneer."

pebble,3cu19a,god_damn_bitch,2,Fri Jul 10 19:44:29 2015 UTC,Some of them are quite old (2+ years) so you can see the discoloration and stretching at the holes. Washing them in warm water with clothing detergent helps it significantly.
pebble,3cu19a,me-tan,2,Fri Jul 10 19:54:49 2015 UTC,I like the purple/yellow/green one

But having them help improve direct competitor product experience in their backyard, and having them spend resources in implementing that, out of the goodness of their heart? I wish I was as optimistic as you... good luck. This is actually the main reason I'm considering switching to Android at the end of the year. Apple makes a damn fine phone, but their attitude/ecosystem/software certainly has its limitations, and it's starting to get annoying."
pebble,3cuvyq,danns87,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:54:14 2015 UTC,well the time app was in review for at least a month and people started getting their Kickstarter rewards and couldn't even use them. Also if we got enough people it's worth a shot
pebble,3cuvyq,Deggyy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'll tweet too, doesn't cost anything. But just thinking about it in perspective: ~1M Pebbles sold, let's say all of them used iOS... compared to 74.5M iPhones 6 sold in Q1 '15 alone. Alls I'm saying is that chances are low."

pebble,3cun07,andysaurus_rex,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:57:07 2015 UTC,Looks good! I'm curious to see if the inside skin peels or pulls away from the outer one. And they probably sent you an extra as a backup in case you didn't install it properly.
pebble,3cun07,Sir_Vallence,2,Fri Jul 10 23:36:22 2015 UTC,inner and outer skins seem to be working well together so far...
