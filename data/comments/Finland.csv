I'm guessing that calling them and trying to make a job interview happen is not looking for job hard enough.    Other options are entry level jobs that require that you have at least 3 years of experience in that specific job. Or gig jobs 2-3 times a year for 24hours total that pays for 15€/h BUT you have to pay for travels to 50-150km away AND have a drivers licence that costs over 5k to get.    Been trying to get a full time job for 5 years now. If i don't manage to get a job during this year. I give up and stop even trying.    Easier and more profitable to sell drugs...

In my twenties I lived two years there due to getting access to a free property but ultimately decided that youth was wasted there. I guess vacations are meant to be wasted, so it's a bit different.  Rent indeed. You might not want to spend summers and winters at same place since you have no special affinity to any specific location. Only if you really want to cultivate one. Because ownership is a hassle. And the market is super slow in declining towns. You can't get rid of your plot in reasonable time without almost gifting it away."

Two weeks of airbnb would cost 490 so with that you have a bit over 1500 to see different places in Finland (Onnibus being by far the cheapest option to travel around Finland) and often eating out and seeing places, whereas one month would cost 1050 so you'd had around 1000 to spend for one month, still good, but more cooking yourself and not buying that much stuff."

This is from 2002, but the numbers are impressive:    The city used the Games to implement an imaginative, wide-ranging urban renewal plan that transformed its decaying industrial fabric into the gorgeous seaside city so beloved of British (and other) tourists.  Barcelona's airport handled 2.9 million passengers in 1991; this year that figure had risen to 21 million.

Finland,3dhgrx,AlrightWallOfChina,26,Fri Jul 17 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"Meh, well. If it's not broken, don't fix it. The point of a mökki is to be a barebones, rustic existence. A mökki isn't measured against the same kind of building code as proper houses, I believe. And the permits required aren't as strict. Plumbing is complicated and expensive, at least to install.  The kinds of Finns who are down with mökki life to begin with are usually the kind who don't mind a bit of inconvenience or going out of their way in pursuit of the simple, natural, quiet, low-tech, rustic, romantic and manual. An outhouse is completely consistent with this."
Finland,3dhgrx,trua,21,Thu Jul 16 09:20:41 2015 UTC,To me the point of a mökki is just so that I can get near a lake and swim and go to sauna. Rustic experience isn't essential imo.

Finland,3dhgrx,trua,7,Thu Jul 16 10:34:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. To be honest, I don't get the appeal of really barebones cottage culture.

Finland,3dhk7h,PleaseDisperseNTS,3,Fri Jul 17 14:39:16 2015 UTC,"Of course, it's always cheaper at home. Until you realize you can't just walk into Lidl and buy ground beef with the correct beef/fat ratio. Or even a decent burger bun. :)  As for ethnic food in Finland?  The short answer is 99% OF THE KEBAB/PIZZA ""GRILLI"" PLACES NEEDS TO GO AWAY. Like, burn to the ground. DIE. They use shit, ready-made products, and they ALL buy it from the same ""tukku"".  OK, the long answer..  From my experience with talking to chefs, restaurant owners, vendors and customers; the answer is quite complicated.  It's a complex weave of culture, expectations, high food prices, and bureaucracy.  Culture- Keep in mind Finland didn't enter the industrial revolution until the 1950s. They are also one of the oldest countries (population age) in the world. Combine that with a climate not suitable for producing much besides berries and potatoes and you get....  Expectations- At one of the restaurants I was consulting, the owner told me I HAD to have a potato dish on the menu because  that's what the elderly expect. Remember, Finland is an aging country. But also because of the late bloom into ""food culture"" every other restaurant in Finland serves basically the same few items.  Part of it is because they are afraid of taking risks and part of it is because that's what (they think) the Finns expect to see on the menu. NOW, there's nothing wrong if everyone is serving the same item IF they all have unique recipes, right? After all, the free market will determine what restaurant will survive and fail, right? Not quite in Finland. Because food prices are so expensive here, restaurant owners choice to buy ready-made products. That makkara plate with fries and that meatball with mashed parsnip-potato, ""brown gravy"" and lingonberry sauce all came from a frozen box. I can throw a rock at any direction in Finland and find a place that serves variations of those items, amirite?  High Food Cost- To Be Continued...  Gotta get back to work :)"
Finland,3dhk7h,kitsey,3,Fri Jul 17 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"These are good points. But it's not just the aging Finns that expect certain things on the menu, even the younger generations do to some extent. Whenever I order Indian or Asian food here it comes with a side salad on the same plate or a pile of carrot salad or something like that. I'm always horrified by the whole notion but the young Finns around me seem to eat it up without question. I asked my (Finnish husband) why a small generic salad comes with every freaking dish here even if it clashes with the food and he guessed that Finns just expect it and it makes them feel they're getting more for their money."

Sandros and Stoa are good north African and not as pricy as their trendyness would suggest.  B-Smokery do the best ribs in Finland. Actually, everything in Teurastamo is excellent. Jadelino makes Finlands best Gelati and Ho's and Kellohalli are both awesome.  Nanking is the best chinese in all the nordics.  Friends and Burgers are possibly the best burgers in the country.  Singapore Hot Wok inside Kamppi mall do amazing noodles.  Grotesk will do you the best steak in town.  Hoku do amazing japanese-hawaian fusion food.  Lusikka is an awesome little place that does great ""modern scandinavian"".  For the upmarket stuff i recommend:  A21 (My personal favorite. They have an interesting concept where they pair cocktails with their courses)  Juuri (Scandinavian ""tapas"")  Gaijin (Japanese fusion)  Olo (Michelin star. Nuff said)"

Finland,3damik,Kaffein,2,Wed Jul 15 10:22:30 2015 UTC,Nokia isn't entering the phone business considering that Microsoft solely has the right to use Nokia brand in non-smart phones until 2024. In fact Nokia is planning to find another revenue stream by licensing its brand to other manufacturers from Q4/2016 onwards rather than build a new (smart) phone division. Of course they'll oversee the products and quality but those aren't really Nokia phones. Foxconn has already launched a tablet under Nokia brand so they aren't reinventing the wheel.  Good idea nevertheless but not a dramatic change in Nokia's business model. Stock price didn't basically move at all during Tuesday so at least investors aren't sold yet.
Finland,3damik,vaahtokarkki,9,Tue Jul 14 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"Microsoft solely has the right to use Nokia brand in non-smart phones until 2024   Nokia is obviously not re-entering the non-smart phone market, that market is dead. They also won't just be licensing their brand, they intend to design products themselves as well, as they did with the N1. If you look at the vacancies posted, they are for people with skills in imaging for instance, an area in which they used to dominate before selling off their design and manufacturing to Microsoft. Microsoft has now fired almost all the former Nokia staff so there should be plenty of experienced people applying to fill those positions."

Edit: Here's some street views from along the route. Another nice thing about biking there is that once you put at least one ferry between yourself and the mainland the traffic will be quite sparse.

Google warns me from ""crossing a country border"", I guess it's Sweden -- does it matter at all? I know, for example, that Finland has very liberal camping rules, is it the same in Åland? Also, do the ferries come often and are they expensive?"
Finland,3dcjkm,kuikuilla,2,Thu Jul 16 20:23:01 2015 UTC,"Åland is an autonomous region of Finland so that's where the ""border crossing"" notice comes from. It is still a part of Finland and there are no border formalities or anything.  The freedom to roam is a bit more limited on the Åland islands. You can read about it here: http://www.visitaland.com/en/articles/allemansratten/  You can find the timetables for the ferries on the Google map I linked. The short ferries like Kustavi-Vuosnainen and Nauvo-Parainen are free and the longer ones are 4€ each.  Just plan ahead for the timings of the longer ferries since they don't go that many times a day. Otherwise there are no big gotchas."

You'll freeze your ass off in a hammock, and the tent will hold off rain better too ;)  From Joensuu I would probably get a ferry towards Savonlinna, that way you can see a lot of Saimaa if you want. Also since you're biking via road 6 (Kouvola - Helsinki part), I recommend visiting Arboretum Mustila. Rest of scenery around the road is quite boring, just large fields on both sides. Another option would be to take a detour and ride alongside the Kymijoki river and visit the old paper mill areas. They're quite interesting imo. Also the road 6 joins with the E18 highway, and you can't ride a bicycle on that. You have to use the smaller roads that go near the highway. From Porvoo you can ride the old Helsinki Road to dodge the highway. It's supposed to be a somewhat scenic route too."

The bigger question about hammocks is probably sleeping comfort, if you have no experience with them. Some people sleep better in them than they do in a bed, some just can't get comfortable. Sleeping on you stomach is probably impossible (depending on the hammock), and there's a bit of a squeeze from the sides which some people find too confining.

Finland,3d8kia,welsinki,35,Tue Jul 14 10:09:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that sex with animals that is harmful to them is already banned by animal protection laws. All sex that is harmful to animals and isn't illegal per animal protection laws yet should be. Rest of the sex with animals: why ban it if it doesn't harm the animals? Because we find it icky? Well, I find it icky to think my parents have sex, but I wouldn't want to make legislation to make it illegal. I even find gay sex a little icky but I was a very vocal supporter of Tahdon 2013, because I realize that me finding something icky is not a valid reason to make it illegal.  From the tone of the article and majority of the comments I read on Facebook I feel that this will be banned it Finland in the future too. There has to be this one group that other people can feel disgusted of and punish. I just can't figure why. How are they going to enforce the law if they can't enforce the animal protection laws we have in place already? What good would banning bestiality do if they aren't going to enforce it more than they do enforce animal protection laws now? I only see bad effects for the new law, and they are the same that were used to legalize it in 1971.   It was thought that criminalising the act was not the right way to deal with people who are likely to suffer from mental illness or who are simply lonely.   How about we enforce the laws we already have and let people who don't hurt animals do their sick thing?"

Finland,3d8kia,tracyiwen,4,Tue Jul 14 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"Considering the realistic alternatives, castration is probably the least harmful option. Of course morally there's the problem that you can't actually go and get an informed opinion from the animal itself."

Your example is another thing that isn't explicitly forbidden, but probably would be considered to go against the spirit of the law if it ever came up in a court.   Teemu Mäki is a Finnish artist who made a video kn the 80s where he killed a cat with an axe and ejaculated on the body. He was convicted, but I'm not sure if it was for the act as a whole or just some parts of it. (Killing an adult cat by hitting it is explicitly illegal now, but I'm not sure it was at the time.)"

Hence I can't personally see any logical reason to specifically target bestiality among the sea of other animal consent violations, instead I view any current logic-based arguments being about attempts to sell legislation which is purely about the ick factor (and politics, seeing how Denmark IIRC made bestiality illegal because they were concerned of the country's reputation)."
Finland,3d8kia,Feligris,8,Tue Jul 14 18:50:23 2015 UTC,"IMO, the confusion around this stems largely from the notion that human morality can be summed up in Harm & Consent.  I mean, we seriously have people sitting and eating hamburgers, talking about how this should be illegal because animals can't consent, and in some cases it harms the animal. I come from a Judeo-Christian background, and I believe this is wrong, but not because of consent or harm. The Judeo-Christian ethic is more comprehensive than Harm & Consent because it involves things like dignity, purity, loyalty, perversion, etc.  I mean, people saying I don't need consent to ride the pony, but I need consent to 'ride' the pony? It doesn't add up."

Typical Sami male names are for example  Aslak, Peivas, Sammeli, Jouni, Kaapi, Oula, Sampo, Isko, Niila, Piera, Nilla and Uula. Here is even longer list of Sami names. Or if you want mythological name, here are some. Although most of those seem to be female deities or long names that are hard to pronounce there is one little bit easier that might suit for a dog name - 'Stallo' or 'Staalo', which is a kind of human eating giant troll.

I've run across bears in the US, and they'll high-tail it out of there as soon as they hear you coming. I wouldn't worry about it if I were you, but take the usual precautions of making a fair amount of noise while hiking and hang your food a good distance from your camp site if you're overnighting."

Finland,3d5r4d,mievaan,10,Mon Jul 13 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"Repovesi National Park is beautiful. It's close enough to Helsinki to make a good overnight. The trails closer to the parking area are quite crowded, but getting out a few more kilometers and there are few other hikers. Nuuksio is also super popular with Helsinkians due to its proximity, also a great place.  Check out outdoors.fi for more possible spots that fit your agenda. That site has pretty much everything you'd ever want to know about any hiking location in Finland."

TBH the most dangerous animal in Finland is a rampaging elk human, closely followed by a derpy human elk.  EDIT: such humans, much danger"

Finland,3d5r4d,Graerth,8,Mon Jul 13 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"Hey - wild Scotslady here. You will be fine with respect to wolves and bears - they tend to be more in the North, with wolves sometimes around the south-west, but extremely rare. The key difference between hiking at home and hiking in Finland is that (a) Finland is very flat and (b) very forested. So depending on where you are going, make sure that you have a good map and/or GPS just in case you get lost, as it can be difficult to work out where you are relative to landmarks. And of course, make sure that someone knows where you are going and when to expect you home. Otherwise, enjoy the tranquility, the different flora and fauna, and the very different landscape, and make sure to check for ticks when you get home!"
Finland,3d5r4d,qvety,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:45:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that its very flat everywehere. In south and southwest yes.
Finland,3d5r4d,Kyesah,6,Wed Jul 15 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"Both scary beasts really avoid people.  Only way you'll be in danger is if you are moving silently and happen to get near the cubs of a bear (in that case, the mama bear will be dangerous).  Only reason people hate wolves is because they kill animals (dogs and reindeers)"
Finland,3d5r4d,popojala,5,Mon Jul 13 19:21:17 2015 UTC,If you have time you should visit Koli national park in Eastern Finland.
Finland,3d5r4d,Saivo,3,Mon Jul 13 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"I really doubt you are even able to spot a bear or a wolf. Most of the Finns haven't and we have lived here all of our ages. (I would be happy to, though, IF I'm inside a car or somewhere else safe) Of course I understand that the thoought of getting face to face with them is unnerving. Even some of the Finns avoid going to forests alone, because they are afraid of the beasts. Which is a bit silly if you ask me. If you are nervous about the animals, use the trick that especially older folk do in here and take a bell or other noisy item with you to scare the animals away. My mother actually takes a pocket radio with her if she goes to pick berries alone.   If you want to explore further than Helsinki area, there's a lot of national parks around Finland. You can find more about them and other hiking tips here, if you haven't already checked this site."
Finland,3d5r4d,kerubi,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:10 2015 UTC,I've heard good things about Repovesi national park and it's not too far from Helsinki. http://www.outdoors.fi/en/repovesinp
Finland,3d5r4d,Baneken,2,Mon Jul 13 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"http://www.retkikartta.fi (available in English) is a great planning tool. You can use it to calculate distances/route lengths, too.  Also, you can buy paper maps for most of the interesting locations from Akateeminen kirjakauppa, Suomalainen kirjakauppa and Partioaitta (to name a few).  Wild animals in Finland are generally afraid of people. I have never seen a bear or a wolf, and I've traveled hundreds of kilometers in areas where I know bears exist (footprints, excrement and other signs visible).  The exception is bear cubs and their violently protective mothers. If you see them, better back off and move away from the area."

They had their own pond and saw no one else (if you choose a bit more remote pond this may happen). They loved it, only ""complaint"" was that the birds made so much noise in the morning they could not sleep very long in the morning."
Finland,3d5r4d,Aerrae,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:07:38 2015 UTC,"Only really dangerous when hiking is the common adder though even that is more of a nuisance then actual risk (risk of infection and allergy mainly even if the snake is poisonous).  Other risk are various viruses from wild rodents such as Puumala-virus that actually was a cause of death for one Israelian scientist last year who studied mice, moles and such, then you have ticks that can carry Borreliosis and other diseases.  So if I were you I'd worry about something else then randomly finding that one bear or wolf for the next 100 square Km's."
Finland,3d5r4d,Harriv,0,Tue Jul 14 08:52:12 2015 UTC,There is no record of people getting killed by bears or wolves but a single baby some hundred years ago. And now even that is controversial. The most trouble from wolves is harm done to dogs locked outside in rural regions NorthEast Finland

There is a even a grand possibility here that the political road in finland when it comes to our own 'Oxi' to EU may be at a crossroads.

All of the money dumped on Greece is going to vanish, we're never going to get it back. It's time to stop dumping good money after the bad.  It would be completely different if the Greek people and their chosen representatives had spent the last 5 years taking the kind of concrete action that would demonstrate that their word is good and their credit is good. But just a few days ago they voted ""No!""  Cut those losses, and when they leave or get kicked out of the EU, institute import tariffs for Greek goods to get back the loaned capital and interest."

Also, do you know/understand the situation in Greece at the time being ? (or what happened in the past 5 years?) and if so can you explain your view of things ?   Now about the money you mentioned. I do not disagree but i think the political error of kicking the can made in 2010, was rescuing the banks, and making it public (country debt) all across europe, when greek bond shareholders were mostly Private banks that suffered no loss. And now EU citizens are paying the loss (inevitably someone has to pay)   I want to hear your ideas and make constructive discussion about those things.   Also  in my opinion  Austerity was the wrong choice, and will keep being the wrong choice. I think investments are what is needed. What would you suggest ?   Please try to elaborate your view on things if you were partly greek as well , just like i am greek."
Finland,3cyla6,BillyDTourist,20,Sun Jul 12 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow European,  Tricky. I personally want to believe that this time Greece is for real. But unfortunately a lot, if not all credibility was lost with the referendum stunt. Also, some of the reforms proposed by the Greek government should have been already done years ago. And what is now proposed by Greece is essentially the same proposal which was turned down by Greece a couple of weeks ago, and also voted NO in the referendum. What am I not understanding here?  Basically, why give more money when it's pretty clear that nothing fundamental will change in Greece. The economy is not healthy, nobody will invest there anyway, so reforms and austerity are pretty much the only option. Unless, of course, someone will continue to fund the current situation.  And what is this nonsense with ""the bailout money did not go to the Greeks, but it went to the banks"" Damn right it did. Greece spent that money already. The money was owed to the banks. Those banks had to be prevented from toppling over, and EU-scale disaster was avoided. Now the firewalls are in place, most of the money is owed to IFM, ECB and ESM. Even if Greece fails now, the only risk (still a risk, though) is the yields of Portugal, Spain etc which need to be managed by ECB to keep from rising too much.  So, Greece will probably not get any more money unless there are clear benchmarks of reforms tied to payments. But how to ensure that those will happen? Ultimately Greece can continue dragging this out indefinitely, so why not eat the bullet immediately and allow Greece to start healing through their own currency?  In both cases the standard of living will drop drastically in Greece, but with own currency the comeback is likely faster.  Economy is based on trust. Trust that agreements and ownership are respected, trust that obligations are followed. When that does not exist, then everything stops."
Finland,3cyla6,Teedm,5,Sun Jul 12 02:12:43 2015 UTC,"I totally agree on most of the things you said.  However i want to highlight that even with more reforms and austerity, no problem will be solved. Economy will keep shrinking and the debt will keep being unsustainable if not worse,   You agree that what greece needs is investment, however reforms only keep raising taxes instead of lowering them, so since we have a 23% VAT on pretty much everything who is gonna invest there with the risk we have ?  make that a 3% (since EU is funding us atm) for 10 years and then start collecting to pay off debts. Create infastructure and get everything working, imo. If you go to drachma, even better you get to PRINT your funds.   The Government made clear that the ""NO"" vote meant a better deal all week long, however everyone else said it meant Grexit. The day after everyone else changed their story. I understand the events need yet to unfold (in the end a Grexit might be the result).   Imo the referendum was a good choice, but i think he didn't expect the  ""get thrown out of the European Union"" threat, and got scared of civil war after that, so he switched towards the same deal he rejected.   Also capital controls pretty much destroyed the banks since they will get every single penny withdrawn afterwards and that was not a choice the greek side made (as far as i know).   The actual problem is greeks don't want to exit the Euro. Even at the referendum polls they said that the majority want to stay in the euro. That's why its so odd."
Finland,3cyla6,BillyDTourist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Investment would be crucial, of course. But how to get investments to any country (not necessarily talking about Greece here, since I'm no expert on Greece), but businesses would be looking at the following:  -availability of skilled workforce, skills dependending on the industry, of course -labour costs -tax incentives, or tax breaks and taxation overall (the tax rate may not be a deciding factor at all, there are plenty of ways to minimize taxes in a given country) -bureaucracy and red tape, corruption -predictability of the government policies and the business environment -size of local market -logistics costs and export possibilities -presence of subcontractors and partners -currency and currency rate risks -overall culture of the country and especially business culture  I'm sure there are more, but looking at this for example from high value-adding industry point of view, like heavy manufacturing or information technology. They have quite different requirements but ideally you would have an environment where both of them can relatively easily set up shop and start running business. The EU and ETA have tackled most of these by uniforming legislation. In general, investing within EU is pretty safe (from european company point of view) but as soon as you go beyond, say Russia (yeah..), Turkey, India (notorious for red tape), China, middle east and such, it takes a lot of expertise and local know-how to be successful. So there is a lot of value being a part of EU. Additionally, since Greece does not export very much, having drakhma back may have only quite limited positive impact on the economy.  Drakhma would instantly devaluate about 50 per cent immediately after introduced, according to an estimate by The Economist. This would effectively make everyone instantly 50 per cent pooree, and the interest rates would probably be quite high (not sure what they currently are, actually). Imports would be 50 per cent more expensive, which would reduce imports quite a bit. But, exporting from Greece would be cheaper for others, which would increase the exports. But, if there is no export industry to speak of (except tourism), the benefits are limited.   Austerity of course shrinks the economy, but the reforms need to be anyway done at some point, and the underlying fundamentals need to change (tax policies and especially collection of taxes, business ""friendliness"", size of public sector) and the actions need to be credible enough to make the other EU states believe that you'll get there. And more importantly, attracting investment. I think whatever the case will be with the reforms, there will be a need to have the possibility to offer tax incentives to new businesses. In euro or not in euro. I'm not sure how ECB, ESM and IMF have treated these currently. There may be more freedom for these not being in EU, actually.  Sorry for the ramble, I may have been off topic a bit. Anyway, shitty situation for everyone, and there seems not to be very good options left. I want to wish you good luck!"
Finland,3cyla6,Teedm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:12:25 2015 UTC,"Considering what business would be looking at :  http://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8871509/greece-charts  Chart number 6 is interesting.  With 25% unemployment rate and so low annual sallary i think the biggest problem is tax rates and burueaucracy.  Tax rates are simply too high , when Bulgaria who is next door gets so low tax rates the choice is rather simple.   What you said about Drakhma is true in the short run, however in 5-10 years from now i ll be in a much better situation than with the euro   Plus i get to have my own policy getting based on Growth rather than Austerity.   About Greek exports. Greece produces a few things but most of all Greece has produced fruits and vegetables and sold them to russia as high quality fruits and vegetables, while greece has been importing lower quality fruits and vegetables to sustain inner demand. The amount imported is bigger than the exported one in terms of money.  I do not disagree on the reforms, my most recent idea is make cash illegal, only plastic money. Give them three months to adapt and then you are done.That way there is no tax evasion and no black market and black money.   Thanks for your insight, i hope it all goes well :3"
Finland,3cyla6,BillyDTourist,2,Sun Jul 12 10:04:25 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Thanks for the charts. I do agree that Drakhma likely provides a better growth prospectives in a long run, so there's that.  Also, about the cash. I agree with tou. My understanding is that Greece's economy is still largely based on cash, which makes collecting VAT and pension payments etc difficult. So moving fromcash to plastic seems a good idea.  I hope this turns out OK at the end, today we will be wiser."

That's the whole point why borrowed money has different price for different entities. Do you really think those private entities should be able to make shitty bets on taxpayer money? How did we get to the point where the choice is between the taxpayer paying the banks off or an EU-wide disaster?"
Finland,3cyla6,roveboat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:09:12 2015 UTC,"No, ""moral hazard"" is an issue if banks are never allowed to fail. But, at that point in time, letting big European banks fail was simply not an option. After the fact, the capital requirements for banks were raised, and one could argue that they pushed europe further into the recession.  Banks should be allowed to make risky bets, but not with taxpayer's expense. That's going to be a tough thing to solve, since banks and banking system are essential to our economy, whether we like it or not. Oversight, yes, but completely changing the system will only move the issues somewhere else.  When talking specifically about Greece's or e.g. Portugal's bonds, the risk of default was not incorporated at all to the interest rates. Cheap money for Greece, solid income for the banks. One or both sides of the game had to understand that this cannot continue forever. Whoever understood that but still continued to obtain or provide loans, reying on ECB bail-out, deserves some finger-pointing. Likely both sides."
Finland,3cyla6,Teedm,39,Mon Jul 13 02:04:15 2015 UTC,"The problems you describe seem intricate and complex, but fundamentally what's most important about them is that they are not my problems to solve.  They are Greek problems which the Greek people are fully capable of solving themselves.  I have my own problems. But since I pay my taxes and I pay my debts, my society is functioning, my infrastructure is maintained, and I don't have problems with getting a loan when I need one.  If this was a natural disaster, it would be completely different. Then we should provide humanitarian help. But this is a self-inflicted problem caused by consistently continuing behaviour patterns. We cannot provide fundamental help by continuing to enable those patterns.  Since dumping more money on Greece will not help with the fundamental problem, it should be considered as an investment. Since the investment will be fully lost, it's not a very good one."
Finland,3cyla6,mikaelhg,-9,Sun Jul 12 01:17:27 2015 UTC,"so me being a 24 year old unemployed person that happened to be born in Greece did something bad ? No i do not think so.  My family is paying the taxes as well, they are paying the debts as well.  However if you look at the numbers  If Greece were to default in 2010 who would have lost their money ? Who did you actually bail out in 2010 ?   Giving money to Greece only serves for paying back loans, nothing more , get your facts straight  literally more than 80% of the money you loan is to pay back older loans (back at you anyway)  What do you mean with consistently continuing behaviour patterns?   I live in a country where in before 2010 (i was 21 at the time) things were awesome and all. But then austerity was opposed on Greece, that form of austerity closed down businesses everywhere , people started suiciding, new taxes were applied , people lost their jobs and their houses etc.  Since you are not willing to give Greece money , devalue the euro, let us print?   I think what we as people need the most is employment. that is a starting point  (even though our annual salary is 50% yours, that is alright)  How is a 25%GDP drop in 5 years a self-inflicted problem, after a memorantum ?  How is GDP/debt rising to 200% in merely 5 years self-inflicted when all the country did was follow the troika and EU suggestions ? (ok maybe not all of them but still)   Don't get me wrong. I m thankful for the money, everyone is (even though you earn from the interest since its an investment), my problem is what i need to do to get them.   How are they not your problems when you already loaned Greece from 2010 to 2015 ? Or is getting paid back irrelevant to you?   Just saying, i could state i m never paying you back and that is your problem to solve, not mine."
Finland,3cyla6,BillyDTourist,31,Sun Jul 12 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"These are all good questions, which are for the Greek people to solve together, as a society.  If you decide as a society, that since you're all individuals, debts accrued before your birth aren't yours to pay back, that's completely fair.  You just need to be honest about whatever position you decide to take. You can't say one thing when taking the loan, and something completely different when it's time to pay back.  Well, you can, but then you find yourself in a situation where nobody will loan you any more money.  The reality the rest of Europe are dealing with now, is that since none of the money loaned to Greece will ever be paid back in non-token amounts, would pouring more money into the bottomless pit do anything positive for our societies.  Every Finn has already paid 2000€ getting nothing in return. That's two months of apartment loan payments."

My reply to you is i have been paying so far all my loans (but the one on IMF , but that's because you haven't lend me any money the past 6+ months)   I as a person have been paying my share as well. There are plenty new taxes trying to make surpluses exist, which only shrink the economy.   I might consider debts to be illegal, but that is not a reply one can say at a national level.   Other than that all i can say is i m better off of Euro i don't understand why the Majority of greeks doesn't see it  I agree on what you said, but the thing is maybe if you didn't loan and gave financial help and helped me reform (without making budget cuts or fixing the system or adding taxes over taxes) i would start paying back in 2-3 years from now due to prosperity and growth!

Finland,3cyla6,BillyDTourist,6,Sun Jul 12 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the austerity is either a huge help or a huge obstacle for Greece. The main reason for austerity is that other European countries would resent having to lend Greece money with favourable terms and witness Greeks make no adjustments.  Ultimately Greece has to either figure out how to be more productive (market-oriented reforms, get rid of clientelism, slash public sector waste) or accept that it isn't a high-income country. Greece's position on the index of economic freedom roughly indicates what it can expect with its current configuration.  Finland greatly increased public spending during the economic boom of the 2000's. The boom was based on Nokia and a good export situation, and during that time productivity started going down, mainly due to excessive wage increases and not making adjustments to the pension system in time. Now Nokia is practically gone and we're in a productivity slump in a bad export environment, and the baby boomers are getting into their pension years. We're taking on huge amounts of debt with no clear adjustments being made so far. We could be in Greece's situation in another 20 years or so, but hopefully we'll ""get real"" before that."

Also HS (also in Finnish)  Sort-of confirmed by Stubb leaving the meeting (in Finnish and some in Swedish)  Apparently (reported by the above sources, but not officially confirmed) the (True) Finns party has unilaterally declared that it will not accept any further bailout package. This seems to be the contents of the negotiation limits approved by parliamentary Grand Committee (multi-partisan institution in Finnish parliament that accepts all government dealings in EU; my understanding is that it's controlled by the government parties; the actual contents of negotiation boundaries are classified) and unless committee reconsiders its position during Sunday, prime minister Sipilä will have to abide by it.)  Without the Finns Party, government would lose its parliamentary majority."

There are geopolitical concerns here that have direct effects on Finland more than almost any other EU country.  Plus, the original bailouts weren't so much for Greece as they were practically speaking German bank bailouts, very similar in a way to the American bank bailouts for secularized mortgages. In that situation, nobody really got mad at the people taking the mortgages to buy a home, they got mad at the banks for being completely reckless with their money to the point of catastrophic collapse.

Finland,3cx8l2,starseeker_,3,Sat Jul 11 19:11:20 2015 UTC,Pretty much every gym is going to be crowded at peak hours (16-19)  I don't know about the hours of your uni gym but I usually go in the morning so 6 or 7 usually. Not much of a crowd at that hour.  And even if there is a crowd you can always ask the guy/girl using to machine if you can work in between his/her sets. Usually it's no problem.

Worth looking into if the price doesn't scare you away."
Finland,3cx8l2,watchyourself,2,Sat Jul 11 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Price is fine, location is very good and schedule is fine. I'm actually quite interested about this place (have seen it advertised so sounds somehow familiar). If it includes some initial guidance I'm sold. What else can you tell me about the place? Anything that you may consider bad?"
Finland,3cx8l2,ClitorisNigga,2,Sat Jul 11 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"It's a good gym in my opinion. It has lots of space and a very  broad range of quality equipment. Isn't too crowded most of the time, at least not in the evenings in my opinion (I mostly worked out between 19 and 23). Changing rooms are in ok condition, sauna/shower are also good.  The guidance thing does cost extra, but I do recommend it if you don't have much experience. They give out these workout program sheets as suggestions on how to start out, as well as a general nutrition plan if you fancy one. Nothing too special about these.  I myself got the 4 month student membership and one hour of guidance when I first started. Definitely helped me get familiar with the machines, even though you can probably figure them out by yourself, or ask someone for help. As long as you know how to train safe and not break yourself.  The people working out there have seemed nice. Of course you can't generalize and assume everyone you meet there will be nice, but I've always gotten a kind answer to my questions.  They will be closed from July 26th until August 2nd for some kind of floor renovation or somesuch, so not the best time to start working out there I suppose. I think I might renew my membership soon also...  E: Don't really have anything bad to say about the place. My experiences have all been good, someone else may disagree. It does get quite warm in the summers, but you're gonna be sweating anyway so I doubt that's much of a problem. Other than that, the only slight negative thing is the price, which is slightly higher than some other places. Up to you to decide if it's worth the location convenience."
Finland,3cx8l2,ClitorisNigga,2,Sat Jul 11 23:34:16 2015 UTC,I appreciate the very detailed answer. Sounds like I'm visiting it right away as soon as I come back from my holidays on August (so they'll have finished the renovations by then).

Finland,3d1cum,wstd,-5,Sun Jul 12 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"Almost. The Nordic Council as it stands now is a platform for cooperation in security and politics between Nordic Countries and, in my opinion with regards to that aspect, is held back by Finland because of its policy of non-alignment.  I'm proposing a cultural bridge as other past colonial rulers have done, such as the OIF and the Arab League, on the principles of past Swedish colonial rule that would limit membership to past Swedish colonies. Doing so would still keep us in the Nordic Council and the European Union, while at the same time securing a closer relationship with Sweden to lessen the threat of Russian advances. In other words, we'd be drawn less to the motives of Brussels, while at the same time keep neutral/friendly relations with Russia. Not so much a defence treaty per se, but one that would bring us closer to Sweden, itself a neutral country."
Finland,3d1cum,tehzeroFIN,10,Sun Jul 12 19:42:56 2015 UTC,"I think the term colony is misleading here, we were part of kingdom of Sweden.  Sweden had few (and small) actual colonies in the americas and africa."

Nordic cooperation could be reinforced. Putting it under the title 'Swedish commonwealth' would just be shitty policy which would de facto mean that it would not gain any substantial support in Finland, and I suspect Denmark, Norway and Iceland wouldn't be too happy about it either.  Royalty is mainly a fun curiosity here in Finland. Hollywood celebs, pop-stars, royalty...all kind of fall under the same category, except royals are worth less on both entertainment value and usefulness than the other two.  The people who are most sceptical about EU are not likely to wish to be under a foreign rule in any circumstances.  Time under Swedish rule wasn't necessarily that bad, but I think we would've gotten rid of our royals one way or another in early 20th century anyhow."

Furthermore, the collapse of Sweden with the immigration policy will be extremely fun to watch from a sauna in finland with some beer in one hand and a tv-remote in the other.  But if you wanted a serious answer: It's impossible because Finland has very few people with left-leaning ideology, they are often more logical when it comes to decisions and less tolerance for society/politicians fucking up, compared to Sweden. Also, they tell it as they see it, they never let ideology dictate their media in the same way Sweden does.  Since you aren't swedish (?), I erased the borkwords detailing the problems with swedish jihadism and the extreme muslims living in Sweden (which never was a problem before the extreme immigration policies of Sweden)."

Finland,3cv7nm,survo,37,Sat Jul 11 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"45 degrees rotated from a Nazi one   Why does this myth about the rotation having any meaning live on? The Nazis used the Swastika in several ways. Google Nazi photographs, if you don't believe me.  The only thing that differentiates a Nazi swastika from any other swastika is how it's portrayed. A black swastika in a white circle within a red field is pretty obvious. Any other form and you might be dealing with other cultures and/or meanings.  BTW, everyone should see this: http://reclaimtheswastika.com/"
Finland,3cv7nm,QpH,14,Sat Jul 11 04:04:26 2015 UTC,"The myth is propagated by people who refuse to learn more about the stuff they hate before hating it.  Nazis used it in many ways, and even on the Nazi flag, the Swastika is seen as 'leftwards' or 'rightwards' depending on where you look at it from. Similarly, both forms of Swastika are present in Hinduism and Buddhism, so the direction isn't a sureshot indicator of the intent. I would even say that the irrational hatred of the Swastika reinforces its status as 'the symbol of evil', furthering its use as a racist symbol. I am especially uncomfortable with this because I'm a Hindu, and we use the Swastika on every auspicious occasion without fail. It's time we move on from Hitler for good (while remembering the lessons his evil taught us), and bring back the beautiful symbol, but who am I kidding. People forgive the cross for being a part of the KKK, but don't forgive the Swastika for being a part of the Nazi scheme of things."

So if I had seen OP's friend using a swastika as their FB profile picture, I would have had a pretty strong negative reaction. The reaction would have been uninformed, yes, but to answer OP's question: in general, I wouldn't say that the swastika holds a strong positive connotation here despite its continued use by the military."

Finland,3cv7nm,spin0,10,Sat Jul 11 13:07:53 2015 UTC,"Well, to be frank, the swastika in the Cross of Liberty crosses looks very different than the Nazi swastika: the arms are truncated and it's almost always placed over a variant of St. George's cross.  I never noticed there was a swastika there until someone pointed out to me.  However, the old Air Force swastika is practically the same as the Nazi swastika."

Finland,3cv7nm,spin0,3,Sat Jul 11 14:17:58 2015 UTC,"The swastikas themselves have identical proportions, both being 5x5 units with the thickness of the lines being 1 unit.

The orientation and what surrounds the swastika is irrelevant. The swastikas themselves have identical proportions and shape."

Look at the symbols I just posted. It is simply amazing that someone can honestly insist they are the same when they're so obviously different and are very easy to tell apart. Can you honestly say you cannot tell which one is which?"
Finland,3cv7nm,spin0,5,Sat Jul 11 19:38:54 2015 UTC,"For average people the color is irrelevant and not ""obvious"".

Yea but for most people the color does not mean it's somehow fundamentally different swastika from the nazi swastika. In practice, the color does not matter when people think is that a different swastika. It's irrelevant. Even though one can see the color difference, it is deemed irrelevant and not significant enough to say the swastika is obviously a different symbol.   Yet you proceed to discuss what you believe most people think of those very things.    Well yea, I speak from my experience of Finnish people and I'm talking about what OP asked. He asked ""how do Finnish people think about the Swastika?"" so I see there's nothing wrong if I tell from my experience how Finnish people generally think about swastikas.   First you ignore the obvious   Yea, well, that was kind of the point. People ignore the blue color as ""obvious"", even though it's obvious to you. What you consider to be ""obvious"" is not necessarily obvious to other people as to make the blue swastika obviously a different symbol from the nazi swastika. For other people, the blue swastika in practice is the same as the nazi swastika, as the color is deemed irrelevant and ignored."
Finland,3cv7nm,Toppo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:17:43 2015 UTC,"The point is that is practically the same swastika (proportions similar enough not to differentiate, unlike Cross of Liberty), just in different angle and color (which is the reason why this discussion occurs).  In other words, it's for all intents and purposes of wearing and using symbols (primary identification, and to lesser extent conveying subtext messages a.k.a. symbolism), same enough to assume the sameness or relation1. People usually think and will think it's a Nazi symbol, and to assume you can explain its history to any casual onlooker not deeply familiar with Finnish military vexillology  requires either ...a special kind of geek crazy, or willingness to wear symbol easily mixed up with Nazi swastika (and not to expect to be able to lecture about Rosen's airplane) for some other (assumed political) reasons (or possibly both).   edit. And it's not like Nazis didn't have some variation in their symbol usage (even if basic shape remains the same). Hitler's personal standard includes various positions and colors and government offices' flag have also horizontally placed swastika.    1 See, for example, how the crosses in the Nordic flags are often referred as ""Nordic cross""."
Finland,3cv7nm,klasu-m,4,Sat Jul 11 19:58:15 2015 UTC,"They both are swastikas, but they're certainly not the same swastika as you can obviously see yourself. And as it happens also in various crosses the angle is very relevant besides the color and proportions. That also applies to the ""Nordic cross"".

Finland,3cv7nm,spin0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:15:48 2015 UTC,"No, but I can assume there's some intended message of relation between them conveyed by that symbolism, and that's certainly the case.

When the Finnish Defence Force swastika is brought up in Finland 90% of the time it's in discussions about Nazi swastika to note the non-nazi use in Finland, or  it's brought up to provoke people with a ""historically acceptable"" logo knowing people will see it as a Nazi symbol.   However, it is not just some random spraypainted swastikas we're discussing but two very specific ones (I linked images of them in my earlier comment, try clicking on the images to see them).    Yea, but they are ""very specific"" to you, but to most people, they are just swastikas that remind of Nazis.  And I brought up the random sprayed swastikas to highlight that even though the shape, orientation and color differs from the most common Nazi swastika, people still interpret those swastikas as a reference to Nazis. So the difference in color, orientation and shape is actively ignored by people as a crucial difference, but rather even swastikas more radically different than the Finnish swastika are seen as a representation of Nazi swastikas. That same happens also with the Finnish swastika, which is by many Finns also seen as bad taste to use light heartedly for the very reason it is considered to be a visual homonym of Nazi swastika.   And my argument was that those two look different to me, and it's rather easy to spot which one is which.    And my point is that most people don't see the differences so significant as to think the other one ""clearly is not a Nazi symbol"".   Only one of those two is Nazi swastika, and other one isn't.   But to tons and tons of people, all non-religious post-WWII swastikas primarily echo Nazi swastikas, regardless of what differences you might see in them.   To tons of people, both echo primarily nazi swastikas, because both are non-religious swastikas and the other one is an actual Nazi swastika and the other one is post-WWII swastika."

""The von Rosen swastika[edit] Eric von Rosen had been using a swastika as a personal owner's mark. He originally saw the symbol on runestones in Gotland, while at school. Knowing that the symbol signified good luck for the Vikings, he utilized the symbol and had it carved into all his luggage when going on an expedition to South America in 1901. Being a friend of Finland, he gave the newly independent state an aircraft, which signified the beginning of the Finnish Air Force. The aircraft, a license manufactured Morane-Saulnier MS Parasol/Thulin D, was marked with his badge, a blue swastika on a white background. The Finnish Air Force adopted this roundel as their national insignia.[3]  Göring had noted the swastika during his stay in Sweden and at von Rosens' castle (forged into a metal piece at the fireplace). However, the swastika of the German Nazi party had been adopted already in 1920, two years before Göring met Adolf Hitler.""  ""Ruotsalainen kreivi Eric von Rosen lahjoitti Suomen tasavallan joukoille Morane-Saulnier Parasol -lentokoneen ruotsalaisen Thulinin lentokoulun käytössä olleen muunnoksen Thulin Typ D. Luutnantti Nils Kindberg lensi sen Uumajasta Vaasaan 6. maaliskuuta 1918. Lahjoittaja von Rosen oli koneessa matkustajana. Tämäkin kone tuotiin Suomeen vastoin Ruotsin virallista linjaa. Se ei ollut saanut lähtölupaa Ruotsista ja Kindberg sai 100 kruunun sakon luvattomasta poistumisesta maasta. Tätä konetta pidetään Suomen ilmavoimien ensimmäisenä lentokoneena, koska aiemmin saapunut ja pian rikkoutunut N.A.B. Albatross oli korjattavana eikä täten vielä palveluskäytössä. Thulin Typ D sai tunnuksen F1 tuhoutuen kuitenkin pian miehistöineen huhtikuussa 1918 putoamiseen Näsijärveen Tampereella.[2]"""

I know a family that (jokingly) folds their joulutorttu a bit differently to more closely resemble a swastika. They also keep other hakaristi-related objects at home, but rather as a curiosity to show to visitors, not as a thing to show off or worship, and not in a Nazi-related way.  While i'm not a Finn myself, the Finns that i know have a neutral to positive reaction to swastikas, depending on context (if it's clearly shown in nazi-related context, the reception is of course less positive than if it's related to Finland).  Those Finns that i met who didn't know that it was used within Finland were a bit surprised at first, but didn't show any sign of disgust against it after finding out about the Finnish use.  When i was on a tour through the Mannerheim-museo, the Chinese couple who was also touring it were surprised to find out about the Finnish usage of the swastika. Our tour guide explained the reasons to them and that it's not used in a nazi-related way. The situation seemed to be a bit awkward to her, but it seemed that the Chinese couple weren't the first ones to ask.  The tour guide told us about some honorary necklace, which was awarded to visiting presidents of other countries. (there was one such necklace in the museum). The necklace had a lot of swastikas on it, which they didn't mind about, until a visiting French president refused to accept the gift, prompting the Finns to remove the swastikas from the necklace, for the French president and any future visiting guests. (this could be seen as an example of ""phasing out"" the symbol, but it's mostly to prevent further awkward situations regarding visiting honorary guests).  I haven't met any Finn personally who would wear it in public or use it as a profile picture. But i have seen such people online at more than one occasion. Usually it was the old symbol of the Finnish airforce, sometimes with an aviation-related username, and that person ended up having to explain it to people. Since i don't know those swastika-profile-picture-people personally, i can't tell if it was actually used as a way to honor Finnish past, or as a way to troll people.  At airshows, old plane's are often shown with their historical markings, including the blue swastika and at the Aviation Museum of Central Finland, the first thing you see is an explanation of the Finnish use of the symbol in a non-Nazi way. (Probably so that visiting tourists wouldn't be ""shocked"" about the amount of historical swastikas in said museum)  Sorry that this was a rather long answer by a non-Finn.

The symbol originates from prehistoric times and incorporates a swastika.  The tursaansydän was believed to bring good luck and protect from curses, and was used as a decorative motif on wooden furniture and buildings in Finland. During the 18th century the simple swastika became more popular in Finnish wood decoration than the more complex tursaansydän.  It has been speculated [who?] that the tursaansydän represented a flying and rotating hammer of the thunder god Ukko (in Finland) or Thor (in Scandinavia). It could also have been an image of a lightning ball, like the Russian ""thunder marks"" (see Perun). Another theory is that it is actually an image of the heart of some being, such as Tursas or the walrus.

Finland,3cv7nm,reuhka,2,Sun Jul 12 09:30:52 2015 UTC,I just think it's aesthetically ugly. Other than that I don't care. Some neo-nazis use it but my issue with them is not the swastika.
Finland,3cv7nm,tehzeroFIN,2,Sat Jul 11 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"The blue swastika was the Finnish Air Force symbol 1918-1944.  Usually the only people who know about it tend to be sort of persons who like to point out it ""isn't nazi swastika at all"". That's always looked very weird to me,  and not exactly commonplace knowledge. If they are actively sporting it, well, maybe they are on some kind of idiotic quest to reclaim the symbol, or just like to rub it other people's faces that they think they've found an excuse1 to wear a swastika that looks very much same thing as the Nazi party symbol, except in blue (which, without knowing its history, looks like an idea of some Finnish neo-Nazi for a great party symbol).  1 A very poor excuse. While, yes, the Air Force symbol precedes the Nazi party and their emblem, it isn't like most people know it. Some people might know that Finnish Air Force used it during the war, but taking into account that we were  also de facto allied with the Nazis for the most part of it, that doesn't help much (and was probably primary reason why Finnish Air Force ceased to use it and switched to Western style roundel, except in some obscure regimental regalia nobody knows about).   It doesn't change the other history of the symbol and its connotations, and makes you look like a person who likes to wear Nazi swastika in blue, for whatever reasons.  edit. And talking about 'honouring their grandfather' sounds like just ass-pull debauchery. It's not like the FAF uses the symbol very prominently in their memorial services, or anything."
Finland,3cv7nm,borsse911,2,Sat Jul 11 10:00:32 2015 UTC,"Iirc the primary reason to stop using it was because Russians saw it and went ""U Wot comrade!?"" at us.  I personally dislike giving power to the nazi swastika by shunning them all, but I'm not one to wear it either as I don't especially care for it.  If it's clearly a nazi swastika, I'll maybe be somewhat ""why'd you wear that?"" but if it's orange or blue or anything else and not tilted, I'll probably shrug at it."
Finland,3cv7nm,ripsmileyculture,2,Sat Jul 11 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it is used in the air force flag , but it is not a common emblem and it doesn't have a positive connotation.   I've never heard of anyone wearing a swastika to honour a war veteran. I've never seen it on a war grave. I've never heard of it being displayed by the public during a memorial. Either your friend is unusual or he is trolling."
Finland,3cv7nm,TheFors,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:55:55 2015 UTC,"Its the Finnish Air Forces symbol and the symbol of Air Pioneers since the late 19th century so I don't know what you're crying about..

Finland,3cv7nm,jaateemies,-7,Sun Jul 12 12:31:36 2015 UTC,"To say it has a positive connotation would be a misjudgement. It doesn't. If something reminds us of the swastika, one can safely say that it's been tainted by the Nazis. He wore the shirt fully aware of the connotations (which are negative; a reminder of our involvement with the Nazis and the Holocaust) and not to honour his grandfather, but to be seen as edgy. He expected the argument and had the technically correct rebuttal at ready. He's an arsehole."
Finland,3cv7nm,testiclesofscrotum,7,Sat Jul 11 22:00:19 2015 UTC,OP's clarified in the thread that he wore a pin and the wearer's grandfather was in the air force. Is someone wearing an air defence ring also an asshole by default in your opinion?

While backfield hits are more about spin and just the right amount of force, there are other techniques that let you go full hulk mode. First, there is the bounce, where you try to hit the ball downwards so it hits the field just after the near foul line, and you want the impact to be as powerful as possible to get maximum airtime for the ball. Second, many low shots aimed at the sidelines or in between the outfielders are certainly set off with full grunt to give the ball as much speed as possible, and reduce the window for interception."

Finland,3cdlrb,Sojir,6,Tue Jul 7 02:15:50 2015 UTC,"Learning Finnish is very much appreciated, though you don't need to talk perfectly. Especially in universities (which are probably amongst the most multicultural places in otherwise very monocultural Finland) you'll manage fine with English, but the locals will still of course appreciate (and hopefully help you learn) Finnish. As a rule of thumb, most Finns don't really know Finnish grammar as it is taught to foreigners, as we've learned the language the ""know-by-heart"" way with some grammar on the side.  Especially for the more shy people, get a hobby! The university probably has tons of student clubs that allow you to do sports (or whatever you like) for cheap. The Student Union folks will help, if you don't find the information otherwise. (Rule of thumb: Hired personnel such secretaries, etc. are in it to work and are quite professional, even if they are fellow students. Councillors/representatives/board members are elected from the student body in something which may or may not be a popularity contest and it depends more on the person of the rep in question. In Finland, the Student Unions are associations. It is required by law that all the students belong to the union. There will be a small fee, most of which (for actual universities at least) goes towards paying the Student Healthcare Foundation (YTHS) which offers fast and cheap healthcare for students. (Note, if you start doing a PhD a few years later - YTHS is not available for doctoral students.)"

Finland,3cc80t,NatskuLovester,8,Mon Jul 6 19:54:06 2015 UTC,"Is prescription cannabis legal in Finland at all? I don't know. But either way, I'd guess it's not legal to drive a car under the influence of anything. That goes for some medicine too."
Finland,3cc80t,kuikuilla,4,Mon Jul 6 20:12:47 2015 UTC,AFAIK yes but it's ridiculously expensive and almost no doctor will prescribe it.
Finland,3cc80t,istwan,8,Mon Jul 6 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"Here are some legal points about driving under the influence in Finland which might help.   It says:   Myös henkilö, joka kuljettaa moottorikäyttöistä ajoneuvoa tai raitiovaunua huumausaineiden vaikutuksen alaisena niin, että hänen verestään on ajon aikana tai sen jälkeen löydettävissä huumausaineen vaikuttavaa ainetta, syyllistyy rattijuopumukseen.  Also a person who drives a motor powered vehicle or tram under the influence of illicit drugs so that the affecting substance of an illicit drug can be found from his blood during the drive or after it, is guilty of driving under the influence.   Then it says:   Rattijuopumukseen ei kuitenkaan syyllisty sellainen henkilö, jolla mainittu aine tai aineenvaihduntatuote on peräisin lääkevalmisteesta, jota kuljettajalla on ollut oikeus käyttää.  However a person is not guilty of driving under the influence when the aforementioned substance or metabolic product originates from a medical product, which the driver had a right to use.   Lastly it says:   Rattijuopumukseen syyllistyy niin ikään se, joka kuljettaa moottorikäyttöistä ajoneuvoa tai raitiovaunua käytettyään muuta huumaavaa ainetta kuin alkoholia tai tällaista ainetta ja alkoholia niin, että hänen kykynsä tehtävän vaatimiin suorituksiin on huonontunut.  Likewise one who drives a motor powered vehicle or tram after using intoxicants other than alcohol or such substance and alcohol so that his ability to perform the required tasks is impaired, is guilty of driving under the influence.   So what I gathered from that: Cannabis is an illicit drug in Finland and it is not legal to drive under the influence of illicit drugs. However if the cannabis in question is a medical product, then he is legally allowed to drive with it in his bloodstream. But then if it negatively affects his ability to drive, it's again illegal.  The last part sounds like something that can be interpreted situationally which is never a good thing with law. You should probably check some other resource as well."
Finland,3cc80t,karaps,4,Mon Jul 6 20:52:38 2015 UTC,The last bit means that legal or illegal you still get fined if you drive a vehicle shit faced from it. Best bet would be to avoid driving altogether while under any sort of drug that can effect your cognitive abilities.
Finland,3cc80t,Baneken,2,Tue Jul 7 06:24:13 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, its not me driving, its my ex driving with my kid in the car. Wanted to know if it was illegal so he could definitely be stopped from doing that."
Finland,3cc80t,Dareat,2,Tue Jul 7 07:42:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's the info I need. So its illegal if driving is impaired, so I guess police would have to see someone driving impaired and stop them for it to be a crime, or they have cause an accident and its discovered they were under the influence at the time. I was hoping it would be outright illegal but oh well, thanks for looking it up."
Finland,3cc80t,avataRJ,5,Mon Jul 6 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"I very highly doubt that you'd be allowed to drive under the influence of cannabis (whether medical or not). With some googling i found that with ""illegal"" cannabis your driver's license may be revoked for several months if you are found driving while influenced.  But couldn't find anything about prescription cannabis and driving."
Finland,3cc80t,stickieickie,3,Mon Jul 6 20:10:29 2015 UTC,"If it is used as a medical product, and it includes the warning that it ""may affect your capability to operate vehicles or heavy vehicles"" in the accompanying instructions or the red triangle, then the safe bet is not to drive, though it is not strictly speaking illegal. In case of use of regular use of large amounts of ""triangle drugs"" as possibly mind-affecting drugs are called in Finnish (kolmiolääke) it is recommended that you ask for a certificate from the doctor that you are using the medicine or keep the recipe/order for the medicine with you. It is also advantageous if you get yourself tested for a normal level of drugs in you, so if you're walked in the blood test you can then prove that it is what you're used to.  In short, ask your doctor."

Finland,3c7jbc,DangerToDangers,13,Sun Jul 5 16:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I've had some encounters with this stuff.  Over or exactly 4000€ donation forces you to pay gift tax (100€ + 8% for part over 4000€ until 17000€). However, that is gift tax. If you legitimately borrow money from someone, you do not have to pay taxes (the person lending you money will pay taxes for the possible interest of course). That said, you should make a written contract and a solid payment plan and have reciepts for payments, because if it seems fishy and you can't prove the money was borrowed, you're probably gonna have to pay.  Actually now that I googled it, the tax officials actually have an information page in English: https://www.vero.fi/en-US/Individuals/Gifts  That said if you have multiple persons to borrow from, you can effectively get 3999€ from each as a gift legitimately without taxes."
Finland,3c7jbc,elmokki,4,Sun Jul 5 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"This also concerns gifts received from the same donor during a three-year period if the aggregate value reaches €4,000 or goes above it.   This is very important. On average you're left with only with a 1333€ donation quota per year. That's not much.    I was thinking of asking my dad to lend me some money for the down payment.   The OP needs to do the paperwork for this so it's legit. Asking their bank about the alternatives might be a good start."
Finland,3c7jbc,Elukka,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I was googling ""borrowing money from family finland"" and mostly getting info about bringing family from abroad. Didn't think to search for gifts in the tax administration website.  I have another question that's a bit related to this that you might or might not know the answer to... When I was renting a flat with my ex I was paying the full rent and she was depositing her part to our shared account which I then transferred to my account. Seeing that the gift limit thingy is only 4k every 3 years, how the hell is that taken into account? Is that something I should have reported on my tax card?"
Finland,3c7jbc,kommutator,3,Sun Jul 5 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"That shouldn't be a problem, and depending on what kind of relationship you mean by ""ex"", even a lot more than that can be no problem.  If your relationship is official (and I believe even cohabiting partners apply here), money transferred between the two of you for any general living expenses (rent qualifies here) does not count as a gift, although as others have noted, it is possible you'd be asked about this (but really unlikely unless the amounts are very large).  You do not need to report this on your income tax.  My partner and I are a single income family, but we do not share bank accounts, and I've been transferring general living expense stuff into his account for many years without anything being asked."

Just make an IOU and a realistic payment plan with your father and the next time you file your taxes include your loan accordingly to avoid any possible problems (money laundering accusations etc).  However if the loan is under 4000e you don't need to do anything.

Finland,3c57ib,OWKuusinen,5,Sun Jul 5 08:58:05 2015 UTC,"Well, if you've read the FAQ...   my high-school degree might not be sufficient enough to pursue higher education in Finland   Like you probably found out, we have two university systems: the ""proper"" one, and University of Applied Sciences. You don't need to have good grades to get into either: there's an entrance exam that checks for aptitude and quota for people with bad papers.   The bigger problem is that there are very few university-degrees on bachelor level in languages other Finnish and Swedish. There are UAS-degrees where the courses are in English, but then you're limited to engineering, business/restaurant/library administration and nursing (I'm exaggerating for effect, but not by much).   You should realise, though, that university is not the only course available for you. You can also enter vocational school (cookery, metalworking, plumbing, electric maintenance etc.). Some of the degrees they provide high and steady income if you're not afraid to get your hands dirty.   As I see it, your bigger problems are that (1.) you don't speak Finnish/Swedish and we don't really cater for foreigners on bachelor-level and (2.) you don't really have a plan for what you want to study.   I'm also a bit suspect why you want to come to Finland -- your reasons would provide several alternatives, some of which might be easier for you."

Finland,3c3gfn,tieluohan,-15,Sat Jul 4 13:44:12 2015 UTC,"You don't understand how severe this would be for Finland. Concerning Finland importing wood from Russia. Russia's wood is very cheap to import and it's very high quality. If Finland substitutes that with its own timber production it might not be sustainable in the long run, as well as taking down the last remnants of the ""real"" forests that Finland still has left and substituting them with monocultural biological wastelands, which is atrocious in my opinion. But business is business right? The numbers they give you is Finland importing around 13 percent of its wood from Russia, which is complete BS. The stats are made up as to make it look that Finland is not much dependent on ""evil"" Russia whereas in reality the percentage is way higher.  Secondly, Russia imports LOTS of finished wood products from Finland and Finland's forestry sector is already suffering as it is, this would basically kill it.   Finland is already doing badly and is headed in a very bad direction, neither Finland nor Russia need any confrontation and have been great business partners for decades, from which Finland has benefited a lot (much more than Russia). Finland is suffering because of their government and populace brainwashed by the anti-Russia scare mongering media for some crazy multinational oligarchs to rape and pillage Ukraine and privatize the hell out of that country."

Finland,3c3gfn,KaiserVonIkapoc,5,Wed Jul 8 13:47:57 2015 UTC,"But business is business right? The numbers they give you is Finland importing around 13 percent of its wood from Russia, which is complete BS. The stats are made up as to make it look that Finland is not much dependent on ""evil"" Russia whereas in reality the percentage is way higher.   So, what is the real number?   Secondly, Russia imports LOTS of finished wood products from Finland and Finland's forestry sector is already suffering as it is, this would basically kill it.    According to the statistics, Russia is about 5% of finnish wood product exports: https://www.metsateollisuus.fi/tilastot/10-Mets%C3%A4teollisuus/Julkinen-FI/a20Vienti_vuosi_005.pptx  How is this number wrong?"

I also see some people wearing shorts though. That's 35+ clothes for me.

Finland,3byqj1,teel,11,Fri Jul 3 11:24:14 2015 UTC,TL;DR Reddit fired the contact person who organizes AMAs and didn't inform nor find a replacement in a timely fashion. Subreddit mods feel unappreciated. They strike.

Finland,3byqj1,Santafio,2,Fri Jul 3 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"I read a bit more about it, and it sounds like the black out is more about how there has been no communication regarding the handover and no one to contact about it.  Sounds like a good reason to be upset, but we really don't know why this has happened.  Reddit could have a very good reason for this.  I don't think it helps that redditors react so harshly and possibly rashly."
Finland,3byqj1,neutralmilkhotel3,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"it sounds like the black out is more about how there has been no communication regarding the handover and no one to contact about it.

Finland,3byqj1,Santafio,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:36:26 2015 UTC,I see.  Maybe it is a good idea to black out then.

Finland,3byqj1,Santafio,3,Fri Jul 3 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"It seems like r/movies did the black-out mainly because of her being fired, so I guess everyone has their own reasons.     Much has been said by many people about the coordinated black-out across Reddit. Our participation was directly related to Victoria's key position at Reddit, not just coordinating of AMAs but also as the only admin that responded regularly to our concerns and needs as moderators.   However, I don't think mods should have blacked-out because they don't like that someone got fired.  that is just a part of business."

Then I guess I'm against you, as I honestly couldn't care less how much reddit owners communicate with subreddit mods or what kind of modding tools they provide.  As for Greece, people in the north don't take kindly of cheaters. Greece lied and cheated itself into its massive debt, and now says that he has changed, and actually everyone else are heartless bastards unless they immediately forgive them, and loan them a little money. Or maybe a little more than that.  Maybe once the people of Greece finally finish their ""unfinished"" homes and pay off their property taxes, things might change."

Besides, it's funny they you mention cheating. I've found the same amount of cheating in the north than I the south of Europe. Only two differences, you hide it better and you are more controlled. But people cheat more or least the same. ;)"

But finns usually drink most of their alcohol BEFORE going to the pubs, because we think the prices are ridicilous. So typical finnish night out with friends in Helsinki is something like this:   Meet at 18:00 Drink alcohol 18:00 - 22:00 22:00 someone suggest we move to a bar because it's getting loud 22:15 someone decides it's a perfect time to heat up the sauna 22:45 - 24:00 sauna 01:00 everyone out of the house 01:30 arrival at a pub in Kallio 02:00 Pub closes, had time for one drink and a piss 02:30 Moved to a pub in the center or Vallila, someone gets a beer, and tomorrow he thinks he shouldn't have had it 03:00 Drunken dancing and karaoke, some sleeping, some pissing, if you're younger then puking goes here as well. Single friends try to find suitable mating partners (so, nowadays this means swiping Tinder and not paying attention to anything else). 04:00 Bar closes, impossible to get a taxi (unless you went to Vallila instead of center), no public transport or busses full of puking teenagers. Complain how there's too few taxis in Helsinki. 04:10 Take a shady taxi in front of the central railway station. Can't pay with credit card, go to the ATM, driver watches you type your pin and steal your card. You don't notice. 04:35 Drinking one litre of water 05:00 - 08:00 sleeping   EDIT: uhm.. Looks like I got a bit carried away.."
Finland,3bxg0m,sex_tourism,10,Fri Jul 3 05:09:26 2015 UTC,"I have never heard a taxi driver try to steal a customers credit card in Helsinki. I think taxis are generally quite safe in Helsinki.

Finland,3bxg0m,kelryngrey,7,Fri Jul 3 05:53:49 2015 UTC,"I meant an unlicensed taxi with the ""shady"" part. :) Obviously normal taxis are very safe, but the illegal ones not so much.

The government does support having children in all kinds of ways and they will continue to do so despite the daycare cuts etc. in the near future. Finland is probably one the best places in the world to have children in terms of not financially burdening the parents and placing them at financial risk. If even that's not enough, then what can you do?   But they also like living in good locations and having extra money.   This is a choice they're making based on personal values. It shouldn't be such an alien idea that sometimes you have to make compromises, maybe get an apartment further away from the city center, buy fewer gadgets and travel less, if you want children. The personal financial situations often won't get any better by waiting and then there's the added trouble of biology and age related complications. Delaying having children will not turn out to be a good solution for a lot of people.   My point is that having children is never an economically sensible action in modern society and the state cannot and should not try to make it one. There just isn't enough money in the country to start financially supporting people's desire to do all kinds of fun and cool things in life despite having 1-3 children. It is a perfectly acceptable situation that people have to make large financial sacrifices when they have children. They already get free healthcare and education and the society is generally very safe and helpful towards children. If young women want to live free and have comfortable lifestyles, then that's their prerogative, but sometimes it means that they have to give up some things."

There's already slight signs of over-saturation of sorts. Sure the market is global, with booming economies (i.e. potent customers) all over the world (South America, Russia, etc.). Alas, the developer side is global as well: people are getting more and more educated about games development all around the world, so our technical expertise might not give us the upper hand for much longer, especially as our salaries are quite high compared to e.g. China or Eastern Europe.  One could also argue that there's only a handful of business savvy people in the Finnish gaming industry, so it's highly doubtful the gaming industry would some day make a bigger percentage of the Finnish economy.  As for why the gaming industry is all the rage now? Rovio and Supercell. Rovio's going down quite fast (one hit wonder with unfortunate business decisions), Supercell's still going strong. But national and foreign investments to newer start-ups, big numbers of downloads, etc...? Look more closely into stuff: many hyped up companies' financial statements for e.g. 2014 look kind of miserable when you read between the lines.

I mean sure, if you understand all of the lyrics of Tuomari Nurmio - Tonnin stiflat, speak well versed colloquial Finnish without an accent and read official Finnish fluently, then you can claim to be fluent in Finnish.  Good thing is that you don't have to be FULLY accepted. Don't worry about it and just make it easier for yourself and stick to hanging with people of similar socioeconomic status. It might be easy to find like minded people from the National Coalition Party for instance.  Jante's Law is very much applicable. People denying this don't know what they're talking about. Who knows, maybe they haven't mingled outside their own income class. Depending on the city or the part of the town you really don't have to do much except wear a suit and there will be people who wouldn't mind seeing your ass handed to you, even if they'd not initiate the conflict themselves. But if you want a fight in that situation all you have to do is start mouthing off and maybe poking the angriest looking guy to the chest with your finger and you'll be likely to get a fight going. If they're not taking your aggression seriously enough, keep at it for a few minutes or change the target. Try to find someone who looks like he's done a little martial arts one time or another. Or just pick some guys who look like they've done some jail time or are bikers, look angry, hopped up on something and/or drunk enough. Good times will be had.  Best possible way to find yourself in interesting situations could be if you start talking shit to local Roma. You might try going through karaoke bars and maybe booing to the Roma singers. They'll love it. It's an inside joke really, they'll take it with good humor and might want to repay you by tickling you kindly. If anyone of them approaches you, just pat them on the cheek like you'd be their grandpa and they your grandchildren. From that they'll understand that you mean no harm and it's all just fun and games.  Finns don't really differentiate between ethnic groups that much. Sure there's general outlines, after all we were allied with the Nazis, but as far as appearances go you are most likely accepted as part of the Master race as long as you keep your mouth shut since people will most likely notice your foreign background from your slightly different sentence structures, your accent and your slightly off vocabulary.  As far as socioeconomic class goes, it used to be that rich people had to hide their wealth. However, this was ages ago. These days you'll be sure to get plenty of friends and an excellent standing in society as long as you keep reminding everyone that it's ok for you to be richer than them and have a degree which actually is worth something, unlike most of the plebs in the whole country. Remember that Finland has only one university in the top 100 of Shanghai Ranking. You should take it up as your solemn duty to bring civilization to this godless backwater country and remind everyone in here that everything will be so much better as long as everyone listens to you and does as you say. We Finns are a lowly supplicants who like to be ruled by superior people, and yes, you could very well be our next president, prime minister or basically take up any position you might please.

Finland,3bg5u6,iorokorom,16,Sun Jun 28 22:54:52 2015 UTC,It's totally possible to get a job in Finland as an English speaker but you'll probably have more luck with either smaller companies/start ups that generally have younger management or a huge international company. I don't know about marketing specifically but the in-between average sized Finnish companies with middle aged Finnish HR personnel are probably more prone to prioritizing Finnish speakers.   Would it be different if I spoke fluent Finnish?    Yes but you won't. It usually takes people 5-10 years just to get the basics down. I wouldn't say it's worth the effort unless you're seriously considering spending the rest of your life in Finland.
Finland,3bg5u6,tenhotuisku,15,Mon Jun 29 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"It took me three years to learn fluent Finnish. Then again I also know people that live here for ten years and can barely order a beer. It all depends on your general learning abilities. And speaking the language doesn't help at all while looking for a job - the only thing that's different now that I speak Finnish is ""sorry we're looking for Finnish speakers"" changed into ""sorry, we're looking for Finnish people."" I wish I was kidding."

I can see in live interaction how much that affects what people think about me: when I introduce myself and say my name, people start acting from cold to flat out rude. But as soon as I clarify, people's behavior changes into ""oh that's amazing, I love Prague, I've been there once."" I suspect potential employers see my name on the resume and don't bother to read further. But well, that's something OP doesn't have to worry about."
Finland,3bg5u6,Cat-With-Lasers,5,Mon Jun 29 17:42:45 2015 UTC,You should add (tsekkoslovakiasta) or (tsekki) after your name.   As you probably understand finns have lot of mistrust on russians. Not only because of wars but because even today you have to take in account that everything under 500kg is probably stolen and even whole shipping containers arent safe if you ship in/thru russia and nothing in there is safe.

Nokia with it's far-reaching, true internationality was forcing people to work in English on all levels of various companies, big or small. Nokia's influence in especially the IT sector of Finland cannot be understated, almost everyone was doing something for them. Everything they did needed to be in English, and this had a splash-effect of sorts in everyone else."

You seem to have a good grasp of English, and being a Korean native you are able to perform translations and other communications between Finland and Korea. So I would focus on Korean companies doing business in Finland (where you would be working in the local subsidiary, communicating with the head office in Korea), or Finnish companies doing business in Korea (where you would be working in the head office, communicating with the local subsidiary in Korea).  To get to know companies companies that do trade between Korea and Finland and/or operate in both, you might want to have a look at the websites of:  Finnish-Korean Trade Association: http://kauppayhdistys.fi/suomi-korea/in-english/  Finland Chamber of Commerce and Industry In Korea: http://finncham.or.kr/  In addition, Finland Forum http://www.finlandforum.org/ is a good resource for information about practicalities regarding moving to Finland."

Start ups tend to have a hard time finding employers and oftentimes get filled with foreigners, currently I'm working at a startup and half of our employees are from abroad, one is a South Korean actually. The other option is to apply for large multinational companies, which tend to work in English, even in completely Finnish teams.  Check out mol.fi and be on lookout for job postings on linkedin etc. Those are what most employers tend to use.  Finland does have a lot of expats and I can't really see why getting a job in Finland would be harder than most other western countries. I'm fairly certain it could even be slightly easier due to literally everyone speaking at least fairly good English, but that's just a hunch.  What kind of a degree do you have or are going to have? You said something about Media and Marketing or IBM? What are you interested in doing in the future?  TL;DR: start ups tend to have a lot of foreigners as do big companies. Start with those."

I'd avoid pure milk chocolates - there aren't too many brands that can best Fazer and Marabou (Swedish, but still) in taste - well, that's my personal opinion at least.   Something like Maltesers though, now those are awesome! Don't think you can get them in Finland either, not seen them here."

Thai women with questionable marriages, people from the Middle East that reufse to melt into society and yes, even lazy Americans that don't want to be here.

Finland,3b7wep,Darth_Tier,0,Sat Jun 27 09:39:56 2015 UTC,Those kotoutumiskurssit can be a huge joke. Especially the A1-A2 level ones where you have a large number of  students returning to the same course year after year are absurd.
Finland,3b7wep,Elukka,4,Sun Jun 28 22:32:45 2015 UTC,I think it was the first  year at least I got close to 800€ a month and all I did was learn the language.
Finland,3b7wep,Darth_Tier,4,Mon Jun 29 06:44:55 2015 UTC,"They allow that for the first three years, which in itself isn't terrible. What bothered me on behalf of my wife was that the city was incapable of offering the courses for more than about 5-6 months out of the year and never more than 22 hours per week. The rest of the time you get to sit at home or downtown. It was also very irritating that at least two of the official courses she attended were intentionally slow and sparse to fill up the necessary hours. Often the day's content could have been stuffed into a 60 minute lesson, but instead the same lesson took 4 hours.   And yeah, some of the people there said they had been on the same A1-A2 course for 3-6 years. It's not because they're lazy or inferior people but because the teaching sucks, they really don't get to practice their language much outside of the class and some people have to start at the very basic level every year they return to the course. A stay at home mom who doesn't know the language is pretty much unemployable and the only thing they can do at the te-toimisto is to put her on yet another language and culture course - every year. After the first three years the money they pay you goes down a little, but as long as you're a nice little puppy and go to the courses and fill the paperwork, you're still going to get the basic dole money.  I think the biggest problem in the system is that there are very few B2-C1 language courses for more advanced students, so most people get stuck at the A2-B1 cusp assuming they get that far. (Yada yada Helsinki this and that. I don't care, I'm talking about the provinces.) In a way I fear that the terrible language teaching results create this problem: if there isn't enough demand for B2 or C1 courses, people will be put on the same old A1-A2 or A2-B1 courses, and this will guarantee that the demand for advanced courses remains low."
Finland,3b7wep,Elukka,4,Mon Jun 29 09:11:08 2015 UTC,"It was kind of the same for me. Courses that stretched out and a lot of free time. That was very hard for me with my wife working, not knowing the city or the language and not knowing anyone."
Finland,3b7wep,Darth_Tier,0,Mon Jun 29 09:24:53 2015 UTC,I'd like to hear /u/grumpyfinn and her take on it.
Finland,3b7wep,picardo85,3,Thu Jul 2 07:27:02 2015 UTC,"There are definitely lazy people in the courses. It wasn't so much any specific nationality, but rather demographic.  There were a lot of housewives that knew they're never going to work or do anything other than raise the kids, so they didn't put too much effort in. There were a few flat-out lazy guys that just showed up for the 780€/month. I'd be lying if I said otherwise.  But there were also people who started out enthusiastic,  but became lazy as the course went on because of how ridiculous and degrading it was at times. Tgere were days where we did nothing, had no teacher, etc. One day we had sex ed. Like, actual sex ed. So if your course sucks, it's easy to become depressed and cynical.  There's also the fact that some people have learning troubles. They're not dumb or lazy, they just need more one-on-one help that my city doesn't have the budget for. So, if I had to guess, it was only about 5-10% lazy people,  and 90% of them were housewives/house husbandds that spoke fluent English and felt like Finnish wasn't important. ."

Finland,3b7wep,eraof5,2,Fri Jun 26 19:13:23 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunately true, and these types of asylum seekers make everything more difficult for people who are genuinely in need of protection as they clog up the system and necessitate large amounts of resources to be invested in fact and background checking processes. They're one of the main reasons the whole asylum seeking process is so slow.  One of the standard questions in family reunification interviews (conducted with family members of persons who have received asylum status in Finland and who are seeking to join those persons on the grounds of immediate family ties) is 'why did the person you are seeking to reunite with choose to seek asylum in Finland'. Most interviewees have been coached to say nothing or plead ignorance, but every so often you'll hear someone tell a little more.  It's been some years now, but as far as I can recall every person who answered anything other than ""I don't know"" or ""because it's a democratic country that respects human rights"" (the standard answer) answered with ""because the smuggler said that if they wanted to get the most money, they should choose either Norway if they didn't want to live in the EU, or Finland if they want to live in the EU"".  Source: I was an immigration and security officer based in the Middle East."
Finland,3b7wep,ninefingers79,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:22:38 2015 UTC,Yep. I bet most of the asylum seekers are lazy bums fighting their way through the system just for shits and giggles instead of desperate people in need.

Edit: I really do not think that people devicing strategies for Finland in Russia truly understand Finnish culture: organized propaganda leads to everyone attacking opinions that portray Russia in positive light even if the opinion is true.

Finland,3b3y0q,Hardly_lolling,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:28:31 2015 UTC,Just to clarify the issue: during peace time reserves can only be called to service by sending them a notice of at least 3 months in advance.   What this initiative does is that it allows willing reservists to be called in without the required waiting period thus allowing a more flexible use of (motivated) reserves during peace time.
Finland,3b3y0q,Baneken,-6,Tue Jun 30 04:49:43 2015 UTC,I like the initiative because we are currently not able to apply for NATO-membership. But I think it's the wrong strategy for us because good reservists will be sent not so well organized against an more organized assault. This will create gaps later on in our deference.

Finland,3b3y0q,HermanTheMouse,6,Thu Jun 25 22:34:50 2015 UTC,I like to think that they would be proud of us. We managed to maintain our independence and got Finland free from the Soviet (and Russian) sphere of influence. Now we are making the effort to protect ourself from the negative changes in the security situation (ie. Russian aggression). Don't really know why they would see any of that in a negative light. Remember that Paasikivi and Kekkonen didn't have much love to Soviet Union - They just had to operate under very hard situations to keep Finland safe.

On the other hand there are about 10 million Russians in Ukraine who probably would want to be part of Russia. Western media doesn't seem to acknowledge their existence which I also consider propaganda.   Edit: Also it annoys me that  the media in US, UK and Finland (those I read) have an issue with Russia invading Ukraine (as they should) but they never had/have problem with the US invading Iraq which was unconstitutional and therefore illegal. Also based on false presumptions."

All of the examples they used are just people who don't agree with the Ukrainian side.

Finland,3b0en7,harakka_,21,Thu Jun 25 03:45:12 2015 UTC,I think investigating how countries try to manipulate public opinion for political purposes is very worthwhile journalism. Even more so when it originates from a neighboring country and is targeting us. Cynically assuming everyone does it anyway and saying it isn't newsworthy isn't how you inform the general public about it.

Finland,3b0en7,welsinki,0,Thu Jun 25 22:55:22 2015 UTC,"> The overwhelming majority of Finns have always been and still are against joining NATO. THIS IS A HARD FACT.   False. 43% of Finns are against NATO, 43% isn't a majority. The high share of non-support is basically the tail effect of the Finlandization era and its ""independence through neutrality"" propaganda. (""Don't annoy Soviet Russia, because otherwise Soviet Russia becomes you."")  Thanks to Russia's recent actions, the share of people supporting NATO membership is rising steeply. Before the collapse of USSR, it wasn't possible to even discuss NATO membership in public.  At the current rate, by 2020 or so, the overwhelming majority of Finns will be in support of NATO membership, unless Russia annexes Finland before that. If the latter case, shortly before annexation, and especially after that, I bet the overwhelming majority will support and appreciate NATO and any other external involvement to help drive out the occupation."
Finland,3b0en7,srkr,-1,Thu Jun 25 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"The overwhelming majority of Finns don't consider Russia as a threat to our country. Your hysteria about Russia invading us isn't based in reality and doesn't reflect what normal people feel here.   Most Finnish residents don’t perceive Russia as posing any security threat to Finland. According to a new survey by national broadcaster Yle, just one-third of Finns say that it’s somewhat or highly likely that Russia would present any short term security threat. The Yle survey revealed that more than 60 percent of Finns believe that it’s unlikely that Russia would threaten security in Finland.  Your own quoted statistics shows that only 26% of people here support joining NATO.    The high share of non-support is basically the tail effect of the Finlandization era and its ""independence through neutrality"" propaganda.   Again not true. Female respondents and those aged 15-22 were less sure of Nato membership than other groups, while those aged over 50 were most likely to be sure of their position."

The draft will freeze art next to the doors?  Where have you seen sloped, cup like roofs with glass windows? How are they going get the snow out? That cant work, can it? I mean, look at the picture and add 1m snow.   I think the building itself is quite nice looking. Definitely seen worse.

Finland,3au1eh,BaffledPlato,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you realized that the outdoor space in between the pavilions is on the second level, on the roof of the lobby space, and it continues onto the pedestrian bridge to Tähtorninmäki. The roof of the connecting lobby is not glass. There is one small ground-level atrium that's open to the sky (a birch tree inside the building in the rendering).  I don't see structurally anything that hasn't been done many times before in Finland and in Helsinki. There's certainly quite a bit of glass, which will relatively be expensive, if you build it to current energy-saving norms (triple-glazed, special types of glass etc.). Still, the glass curtain walls of Musiikkitalo are quite a bit larger single surfaces and they don't seem to be a problem.  Museums have been built with windows in the roof for a long time, even in Finland, and the glass elements can be heated electrically to melt away snow. I believe e.g. the platform canopy of the Helsinki Central Railway Station does this.  If I recall correctly, the jury commented on the proposed roofs and said that they need work, but I gathered that the complaint was about lighting conditions indoors rather than snow or energy saving."

Finland,3ayokr,MyPlantsHaveNames,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:57:46 2015 UTC,"There's more to a culture than language.  Finland shares anything from state of mind, social contracts, work ethic  and unwritten laws to music, literature, architecture, law, history, and Christianity.  On the other hand, Finland has a slight disconnect between south-western and north-eastern Finland in terms of culture as well."
Finland,3ayokr,Biiviz,2,Thu Jun 25 13:29:59 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm not arguing otherwise. The definition of ""Scandinavia"" that excludes Finland, however, does make it's exclusion on the basis of language, which is a considerable factor of any culture."

They don't have the rights to distribute a lot of their aired content outside of Finland and they can't realistically do anything about it.

If she would have finnish B.Sc. nursing with special needs kids focus, those are highly paid jobs that make close engineer level wages.   Easiest to google the rental sites. Highly depending on the area where you live.  Google... Civil service is over 12 months, while the shortest army track is 165 days.

Is it a nursing job in a hospital? Behavior/occupational therapy for children?
Finland,3ar0uv,shcrane92,5,Tue Jun 23 00:47:08 2015 UTC,It means you're a nurse/baby sitter in what is essentially a day care for the disabled children.
Finland,3ar0uv,Baneken,3,Tue Jun 23 06:02:53 2015 UTC,"Support for kids with paralysis/retardation or similar. Friend's ex wife does that job. It is a goverment job and apparently has a lot of relation to the condition and needs of the kids. I dont know too much, since I dont work in the field.   You could also get employed as a personal assistant to disabled. The salary is reimbursed by the city. http://www.ammattinetti.fi/ammatit/detail/294_ammatti?link=true  I think there are also general nursing jobs in the hospital, if you are not afraid of hard work.   Certified teacher in years 7-9 in Finland requires a 5 year master degree to qualify. In addition you need fairly small amount of credits in university for the subjects you are planning to teach.   Years 1-6 need s masters in elementary education, which is a separate masters to teach the small ones.   For highschool (years 10-12) you need teacher module (about 2 years) in an university and master's level study module in each subject you are planning to teach.   To teach, you need pretty much spot on finnish. If you want to teach, best way would be to cram english courses in university and become english teacher in upper elementary/highschool. Takes couple years though to establish.   For nursing, you might be able to get a low level nursing job very fast, since there is shortage of nurses. Even with limited language skills."

That means 5€ a day for the first 6 months, after that it goes up to I think 8,5€ and later to 11€ or some such. They are also obligated to either provide you 4 meals a day or money for it, as well as transportation up to a certain cost. They also pay the same percentage of your rent as if you were in the army.  You have to search for a place on your own, most non-profit government services hire civil service-men. Hospitals, police stations, old folk's homes etc. I'm currently working at a prison.   Note that you might still have to work weekends.

Finland,3ar0uv,Nurmes,8,Wed Jun 24 05:50:46 2015 UTC,"There's been some good points already, but here are my answers:   As others have stated, language will be a problem for your wife with a degree that would be really good for getting a job otherwise. However, I'm quite certain that she can find a temporary job as a waitress and some babysitting in Helsinki, since finnish is not required for those so much, most people in Helsinki speak english and won't shy away from her. You can look for a job at www.oikotie.fi and www.mol.fi. Most places are reported in finnish though. Helsinki doesn't generally have ""bad"" neightborhoods, as city-planning is different from the US. Every neightborhood has a mix of owned, rented and city apartments, with a few exceptions. The center is really expensive at the moment; monthly rent for a 1-2 room apartment (30-50 squaremeters) is around 1 000 euros at the centre or near it. In Finland you usually pay for electricity, water and internet on top of the rent, which will add maybe 50 euros a month. You can search for rent-prices at www.asuntojenvuokrat.fi, but unfortunately it's in finnish. If you want to look for cheaper housing but with good connections, I'd move towards the east following the metro line, since the metro is fast and reliable, and the prices are still a little lower there. I wouldn't go further than Herttoniemi though. You usually don't pay for studying in Finland, so I think this is something you should ask from Omnia. I'd still consider going to the army, as it's much shorter than civil service. Nowadays you get a weekend-holiday almost every week. You don't, to my knowledge, get any wage from civil service. They pay your rent however, if certain conditions apply. You can search for a civil service job for yourself, and you should, because you can maybe find one in a field that interests you, and then continue working there after the civil service."

And that was in a very small town near Iisalmi, so I'm pretty sure your wife has a good chance to get at least a temporary job in the Helsinki area.  Send an email to Omnia and ask them personally. https://www.omnia.fi/web/ammattiopisto/hallinnon-yhteystiedot Six months isn't much, so dropping out and applying to another school would be pretty pointless, but it's up to you if you'd rather pay a certain sum or fight over which courses you do and don't have to do again.  Army and civil services should have the same benefits, as has been stated before, and finding the civil service job yourself will ensure that you'll be happy with it and it'll be beneficial to you in the future.

The education system in Finland is super competitive and if your partner's ultimate goal was to be a teacher, it's impossible without Finnish and a Finnish degree. But Helsinki might have English LPN courses,  and with that degree you could work in a daycare or with special needs kids.

As far as i know the 4th year is NOT free but am not sure about the expenses as i never had that issue. I did civil service myself so this is how it goes. You are going away for a month to a place (Lapinjärvi) to study and during that time you have to apply for a job that starts after the month. Now, the funny part is that you cannot apply for any job, it has to be a nonprofit organisation like a governmental institution (school,hospital).

The actual classes don't cost anything but you will need to take care of yourself financially in all other regards.   I would also suggest you move to Finland sooner rather than later because the rate at which non-EU immigration laws are changing here at the moment, we may soon have laws similar to Denmark and The Netherlands where you will need to move back to Finland alone at first, find a job with a stable long term contract that pays over a certain amount before you can apply to bring your wife over.

I see my local college offers some instruction in English, but couldn't suss out how much is offered.  But, check out the ministry of labor's job board for yourself.  Otherwise, you could possibly use whatever education/training you already have to springboard into a master's program somewhere. There are English language programs obviously aimed at international students. This is the ministry of education's study in English website. There's no tuition fees that I'm aware of, but you have to prove yourself capable of financing your studies in Finland for the duration.

Although japanese has different layers of ""politness"" to it that Finnish lacks (Finnish lacks subtlety. Its a bit of a blunt force language).

It's not just ""different groups"". There's a world of difference between corporate executives or entities and goddamn anti-democratic, violent, even subversive Neo-Nazis. Politicians aligning themselves too closely with corporates and corporate interests is of course problematic to say the least, but the level of co-operation we've seen so far hasn't been anywhere near as alarming as this.   If Immonen did something that was clearly in support of neo-nazi    What exactly would constitute as ""doing something that is clearly in support"" of them, if this doesn't count?   it is just a hysteria on the minds of people that cant stand for any kind of difference in opinion.   Like I said, I'm more angered by the blatant lying. If he had been honest, there would be some room for debate, even though I do think SVL and Neo-Nazis in general are scum.

We all know what kind of event he was attending, who organized and what kind of people attendant. Claiming that he's not in any way behind the political ideologies of the event is just insulting in how stupid he must think people are.

The operation took place on June 22, 1941, and in this way, Finland strived to prevent Soviet landings in the area.  The Åland islands had been demilitarized since 1921, through a League of Nations decree, which outlawed any military personnel or material on the islands. After the end of the Winter War, the Soviet Union controlled both the Hanko Peninsula and Estonia and the Finnish leadership feared that the Soviets were planning a landing in the demilitarized area. The Finnish militarization plan was ready by April and they started to move troops towards the coast between Turku and Pori according to the plan.  The operation was launched at the same time as the German Operation Barbarossa. The landing involved over 20 cargo ships, the two coastal defence ships Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen, as well as the three gunboats Uusimaa, Hämeenmaa and Karjala. More than 5,000 men and artillery were landed the same evening in Mariehamn. Soviet aircraft tried to attack the ships during transport, but without result. The Soviet Union had also created a similar plan after the Winter War, but they never tried to land on the islands during World War II.

Avoid Avis.  I have to echo what others have said about one-way charges, they will bite you in the arse. I ran a quick check on Sixt and a 24h rental Joensuu->Helsinki is about €320, whereas you can rent for 4 or 5 days Helsinki to Helsinki for the same price.  Rental over here is pretty expensive, there's no avoiding it; however, there are some tricks you can use to save quite a sum, especially on short rentals. Airport rentals are always more expensive, so if you don't mind a little public transport you can always check out the other pickup points dotted around the city. Similarly, city centre locations carry an extra charge, but only for collection (not drop-off). Europcar's central railway station point is an example of this.  As for driving in Finland, if you've ever driven outside the UK it will be a breeze. Once you get 30km outside of the Helsinki region there is so much space on the motorways it's unreal, despite the fact that all of them except the ring roads are only two lanes. The problem comes once you get off the main intercity motorways and onto the glorious one-lane stretches that go for 10s or 100s of kilometres.

Nothing you can do to clouds really now can you :P When you're at Ivalo, do check this site for forecasts. Change language to English from the top menu."
Finland,39rts1,Hartsai,2,Sun Jun 14 04:05:29 2015 UTC,My experience is not that positive. Northen lights usually does not look as bright and colorful as in photos but are still pretty cool. Is it so that you can see Northen lights every day? I feel it is more like once or twice a week.
Finland,39rts1,Lantti,2,Sun Jun 14 06:40:35 2015 UTC,"You can't see them every day, it's completely dependent upon the sun and how much it sends charged particles towards the earth."
Finland,39rts1,kuikuilla,2,Sun Jun 14 07:48:42 2015 UTC,I'd guess part of it is that no one bothers to take or post photos of weaker lights so all the photos you see will be of the best ones.
Finland,39rts1,Graerth,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:29:47 2015 UTC,In winter (ie . january) they happen very frequently   What about end of September?
Finland,39rts1,sverige_svenska,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yes it is possible. However you cant really see northern lights when its bright outside so thats one limiting factor. It is dark at nights around end of September, but comparing that to January when its dark pretty much 18-20 hours a day. So the chance to have the optimal viewing weather and darkness is higher in january than in september id say. Check this old graph of chance to see northern lights. X axis is the month and Y axis is the total amount (%) of northern lights occuring in certain month. So in that graph about 12.5% of all northern lights in that year happened in september/early oct. In Inari that is."

Finland,39rts1,sverige_svenska,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:38:43 2015 UTC,"The equinox happens September 23. That means the day and night are approximately equal length in that day, and the darkness quickly gets longer after that. In Rovaniemi Sept 23 Sun rises at 7:01 and sets 19:17 with 53 minutes twilight.  The best time of day to see auroras is is roughly 1-2 hours before midnight, and 1-2 hours after midnight as that's when substorms tend to happen. At those hours there will be dark even in September."
Finland,39rts1,spin0,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:47:46 2015 UTC,Neat. Sounds awesome :)
Finland,39rts1,sverige_svenska,7,Sun Jun 14 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"Are they as good as the pictures though, or are they just long exposure techniques?   Well, yes and no. There are different kinds of northern lights and they vary a lot in their brightness, shape, size, movement, and color. To see the dimmest auroras you need dark skies away from light pollution and your eyes adapted to dark. The dimmer the auroras the more enhancement they get from long exposure photography. But photographs do not do justice to the best aurora displays - they're far more awesome to see in the sky yourself than a photo can convey.    Also, do the Northern Lights happen only occasionally or is it every night?   Now that we have passed the solar maximum, up there North they happen (almost) every night at least in some form. You don't need a geomagnetic storm for that but usually just the steady solar wind will suffice. And there's a chance you get to witness a storm if you're lucky.  People often don't see northern lights because they simply don't know when, where, and what to look. The best time of day is roughly 1-2 hours before midnight, and 1-2 hours after midnight. That's when substorms tend to happen producing aurora displays lasting from minutes to over an hour. The higher the solar wind speed&density, the higher the substorm geomagnetic activity and the brighter, bigger, longer the aurora displays will be.  In addition to the normal solar wind sometimes Sun coughs up a high speed plasma cloud (CME) to our direction. When such cloud hits Earth's magnetic field you'll often get aurora displays soon after. Those shows can happen any time of day as long as it's dark, and the effect depends on the cloud's magnetic configuration, speed and density. Predicting those is only possible about 1-3 days ahead, so check out the solar activity and predictions regularily during your stay. Here's some recommended sites for that: http://aurora.fmi.fi/public_service/ (Finnish Meteorological Institute's service with aurora cameras, magnetometers, and info relevant to Finland, choose English) http://www.solarham.net/  (IMO the best site with awesome amount of relevant links and updating technical info&data, but consuming the technical bits needs a bit of learning for best benefit) http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ (excellent NOAA's space weather and northern lights site) http://spaceweather.com/ (a good and easy to use site for beginner)     If you know there is a CME coming our way you can predict the exact time the plasma cloud hits about an hour before it happens. There's a spacecraft called ACE about 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth towards the Sun. It's an old workhorse with some of it's instruments already malfunctioning but it's the only one we got of its kind, and you can follow its measurements in real-time: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/ace-real-time-solar-wind  When a CME plasma cloud hits ACE there will be a noticeable spike in the speed measument (yellow), and in the magnetic field measuments Bt (white) and Bz (red). There would be a spike in the density/temp too if the instruments still worked correctly so forget it. After the cloud has hit ACE it will hit us in about an hour depending on its speed (an easy calculation to make yourself). And when the cloud hits us the impact will likely produce a show in the sky soon after and possibly cause a geomagnetic storm.  But there's a added twist: the red Bz graph will tell you how good a show it's going to be. The more the Bz points towards south (negative numbers) the bigger the geomagnetic disturbance and the bigger the auroras. AND this also applies to normal solar wind and substorms. So, even if there's no CMEs coming remember to check if ACE's red graph is negative and you'll have better chance of substorm auroras for that night.  Also Earth-based magnetometers are useful: If you get bored watching the sky waiting for something to happen, check out the magnetometers in the area and in places closeby (see the Magnetic disturbance level in the Auroras Now! service). If they're on red something should be already happening or at least is going to happen very soon."

But holy shit it was amazing. The northern lights happen when the sun is spewing out a lot of stuff toward earth, and depending on how strong the storm is, the lights go down farther. Since you'll be in Ivalo, you don't need such a strong storm to see them.   I personally liked this site http://www.aurora-service.eu/aurora-forecast/  Happy to give more info about northern lights if you want. Also, the long exposure actually made the northern lights worse for me. They were so dynamic and active above us that anything longer than a one second exposure made them smear, so it was definitely not just a trick of the camera. The secret is that you have to get away from lights and civilization, and then you are golden"

Finland,39rts1,Telefinn,3,Sun Jun 14 06:09:33 2015 UTC,"I went to Levi last Christmas, the first time for me in Lapland during the winter (had been in Spring and Summer), and saw the Northern Lights on Christmas Eve. It was quite magical, though not necessarily as spectacular as could have been due to light pollution where I was.   That said, a friend of mine who is married to someone originally from Rovaniemi, saw the Lights this year for the first time after 12 years of travelling to Lapland regularly to visit her husband's family.  In short, seeing the lights is down to luck. You might or might not. No guarantee."

Finland,39mfs1,tonninsetelit,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:35:20 2015 UTC,Its really a restriction from the past when physical media was actually relevant and the labels wanted to print as much money as possible. In this day and age there is absolutely no reason why u even need to have labels and stuff when you can distribute music online easily and cheap. But then again the labels pay the studio time and such. It will probably take tens of years still until the money greedy label and recording companies die slow death. I would instead suggest you'd pay someone to buy the records and then rip them to mp3 format and just send online. But then again i guess that would defeat the purpose of just pirating them in the first place.

Soon enough Finnish universities and ""not-so-real-universities"" will all conform pretty well to the Bologna process standards and even the ""real university"" students will first study a bachelor's degree and then apply to a master's program. (They still automatically get the right to study an MSc. after the BSc. but I'm sure that'll change and eventually only a portion will be accepted based on applications and academic qualifications.)   at a ""real"" university.

I was really disappointed when I asked for an advisory meeting in 2013 at a Finnish university regarding a masters degree programme and they just told me I was not eligible, because I got my degree from a German university of applied sciences. I even wrote the (German) national accreditation council and they told me that should not happen, unfortunately each university still has a large degree of freedom regarding their admission rules."
Finland,39mfdf,OWKuusinen,2,Sat Jun 13 06:04:14 2015 UTC,"Is it a useless degree?   Depends on the degree. Nurses are respected. Engineers are pretty respected. What are you going to study?   Is it socially stigmatized/frowned upon?   Again, depends more on the degree. Finns aren't really interested in where the degree has been gotten from, as all the places are pretty much on the same level.  That being said, most university students graduate as masters, and AMK-degrees are bachelors, so there's that (you can upgrade to master's later if you wish - even in a proper university if you want).   Do companies accept them, does it have the possibility to land me a decent (not amazing) job?   Depends on the degree. If you're thinking of nursing, it's a sure way to stay employed till you retire.   Is it Internationally recognizable?   Yes, due to bologna-process they are comparable to bachelor's degrees from other EU-countries."

You apply, not just with your diploma but with your study plan finished and your reasons why you want into the program. Only few people (usually ten) get chosen. I have no idea what the criteria are that they use. Probably depends on the program.  On the other hand, if you get to university, you're guaranteed a place in master's program from the moment you get your ""thick letter"".

Plenty of recent professional critique (reports, retiring insiders speaking out) towards development aid + the Finns in the cabinet... and the overall need to make cuts.

Finland,39js5d,FinFihlman,13,Fri Jun 12 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"The bulk of Finnish foreign aid goes through international organizations and member state pledges, which remain more or less unchanged (correct me if I'm wrong). I see the new agressive cuts hurting the smaller players the most.   This could be good to weed out shady NGO's that are not contributing to real development or aid, but will definitely hurt the industry overall - an industry that needs serious rethinking in relation to funding operations (public, private, debt, donations), actual trade barriers (trade quotas, national industry stimulus),  as well as transparency and accountability (both public/local organizations and private/CSR/tax/ethical issues) etc.   We can always protect national interests, but the fact is we live on this planet together. We are more and more connected every day, and together our actions determine the future of global society. Populations are growing and the amount of refugees has never been this high. Throw in global warming and the horrible future scenarios of millions of people drowning etc., and you'd think that we would not be so quick to cut from development aid.   It's an easy solution from an austerity point of view, but the new cuts and change towards more corporate funding seems a bit hasty and shortsighted."
Finland,39js5d,Susirajan_takana,5,Fri Jun 12 07:38:41 2015 UTC,"It would appear that these cuts are going to affect the NGO sector the most. The majority of Finnish Development NGO's focus on service delivery in developing countries. Such as improving sanitation, sexual education, access to markets, hygiene etc. The results of this are often quite small, but also have the most direct effects on the lives of some of the poorest people.   What these cuts are now going to cause is these development NGO's are going to have to try and find funding elsewhere. Private donations and corporate funding. NGO's will have to focus much more on fundraising to be able to maintain themselves as opposed to actually striving to achieve results.  International organisations, mainly the UN, have been proven to be some of the most inefficient providers of development. They have a focus on large intangible goals, that can be interpreted in a multitude of ways. Such as the Millennium Development Goals, the Post 2015 agenda and the soon to come Sustainable Development Goals.   To paraphrase the development economist Paul Collier, who was visiting Finland recently, these large scale development goals are bullshit. Instead it is much better for countries like Finland to focus their Development aid on the very poorest countries at the small scale."
Finland,39js5d,AmIReallyaWriter,3,Fri Jun 12 08:41:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that aid is more effective at the micro-level. But it's far from agreed that more macro focused aid is ineffective, it's just really hard to measure it's effects, or at least really hard to measure them in a way everyone can agree on.  It's the same with all macro to some extent, there's no definitive answers to a lot of questions, consequently people tend to fall behind any answer which supports their more general political outlook."
Finland,39js5d,Susirajan_takana,3,Fri Jun 12 10:48:37 2015 UTC,"The issue with macro focused aid is that it is political by nature. The aims become multi-interpretational (is that a term?) because they have to be agreed upon in consensus among a group of countries. They are an extension of foreign policy where national aims and prestige are put to the forefront, as opposed to the needs of the poorest. Then these goals are used as a model for top down development. Essentially us telling them how they should build their countries. This is the Bono, Live Aid and Jeffrey Sachs model of development.  The model espoused by academics such as Paul Collier, William Easterly and Dambisa Mayo is a bottom up model. Letting the initiatives come from the people in these countries at the grassroot level who understand their needs far better than any outsider ever could. Finnish Development NGO's usually work in partnership with local NGO's aiming to support the work that they are already doing. There is of course a huge variety of  NGO's working in this field with varying levels of success, but at best the Finnish NGO's provide valuable support and learning to people trying to improve their own situation on their own initiative. This is what they are now threatening to end and it will be a tragedy if they do."
Finland,39js5d,AmIReallyaWriter,4,Fri Jun 12 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to distinguish between ""bottom up"" approaches in the sense Easterly is talking about, and approaches that focus on micro-level interventions. Easterly is pretty critical of some of the things your first comment outlined as the most effective uses of aid. By bottom up doesn't mean that aid should never be intended to achieve more macro aims, just that how it is used should be more driven by the actual needs of the poor people in the country. I don't think many people would disagree with that, and that is a part of the agenda for lots of aid organizations (see the ""ownership"" part of the Paris principles).  The problem is the same people who claim aid is too political, are the ones constantly arguing to cut it, which means it has to be political, because governments in rich countries have to be constantly demonstrating to the electorate that it has achieved concrete aims that the electorate cares about it. That obviously makes it difficult for them to give more control over how aid is used to the developing countries themselves."
Finland,39js5d,Susirajan_takana,3,Fri Jun 12 12:47:47 2015 UTC,"You make some very interesting and pertinent points. The fact with development is that it is a highly complicated issue, with no real right opinions.   Even myself I'm caught in two minds about these cuts. On the one hand I don't think that they are necessarily a bad thing, I would just like to see their focus be different than what is now being touted.   I have had the displeasure of personally seeing how multilateral organisations work and left that experience thoroughly disenchanted. If there ever was an organisation weighed down by bureaucracy and unnecessary hierarchies etc. the UN is it. I often think of it as the worlds biggest hot air and paper waste producer.  At the same time I also think that private investment should have a larger part to play in development. There is huge unused potential in a number of African countries. Ostensibly private investment is bottom up development, allowing the locals to decide what thrives and what doesn't, with the development then that comes from this being ""apolitical"" and organic.  NGO's in Finland are then in a strange middle ground. A large amount of their funding currently comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has development aims defined by the goals set in the UN. When applying for funding for any rinkydink tiny development project they have to explain how this project works towards given MDG's, SDG's, gender empowerment or what have you. In many cases I think this is quite pointless and far too abstract on the scale that the NGO's working.  What I afraid of is that these cuts are going to be done very quickly, with a large amount of the NGO funding especially being cut. I'm afraid that this will come as a shock to numerous NGO's that have to either cease their development projects or find alternative sources of funding. Charity for instance and I don't like the idea of private charity being a main focus of funding for development, mainly due to the issues of image and stereotypical pictures of starving Africans."

Finland,39js5d,Thamanizer,5,Fri Jun 12 07:22:14 2015 UTC,"Actually most of the state-to state development aid today is tied to goals such as improving human rights, achieving sustainability, and eradicating corruption. For example, Uganda's aid was cut by many countries because they failed to reach human rights goals; also, Liberia cut down deforestation almost entirely because it was a condition to get aid from Norway. One reason the Chinese are so popular in Africa is that they bring jobs and business without requiring the governments to improve their institutions.  The reason development aid has such a bad rep was its nature back in the 50s and 60s. Development aid used to be of the type: ""here's a cheap loan that you can't pay back anyways, you'll get it as long as you allow our corporations to effectively seize your means of production."" In a lot of African countries, this resulted in their domestic economies being turned into cheap labour/resources for French or US or British companies. Examples include shameless exploitation of the oil fields in Niger and turning domestic farmlands in Mali into industrial sugar and cotton farms, hence causing immense famine and unemployment."

Finland,39js5d,OWKuusinen,3,Sat Jun 13 07:03:55 2015 UTC,"Partly? How much?   It's a large issue. There's a huge amount of countries and several ways which the aid can be given. Some countries got developing aid for different reasons than others and had better architecture to use it for higher gains. Some countries had natural disasters that caused the development project's labour to go in vain as soon as the ribbon was cut.  You can't just bundle them together: any comparison would have to be done on project-level.  I said ""partly"" because...    Is there data to prove that development aid played a significant role or is it just a gut feeling that it helps a lot?   My father did his life's work in organising development projects on site and his characterisations weren't always the most positive. You could say that my views on the topic are formed by visiting these places as child/teenager and comparing what I can read of them today - and complaints from my father of the many ways things could and have gone wrong.  My father's opinion in a nutshell was that development aid was necessary, but it was often targeted badly, in both countries given and the money-holes chosen.   The articles I've read and the few 101-courses on development aid I've done seem to support father's views. But I don't really have any data, other than the developing countries have several times the GDP today than they had in the 80s."

Despotic governments will run out of land and raw materials to sell at some point. The increase in prosperity is predicated on turning African nations into China's cheap labour force."

Finland,39ec6p,kurav,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"Kama (food):       Kama (in Estonian) or talkkuna (in Finnish) is a traditional Estonian and Finnish finely milled flour mixture. The kama or talkkuna powder is a mixture of roasted barley, rye, oat and pea flour. The oat flour may be completely replaced by wheat flour, or kibbled black beans [disambiguation needed] may be added to the mixture.  Historically kama was a non-perishable, easy to carry food that could be quickly fashioned into a stomach-filling snack by rolling it into butter or lard; it didn't require baking, as it was already roasted.  Nowadays it is used for making some desserts. It is mostly enjoyed for breakfast mixed with milk, buttermilk or kefir as mush. It is frequently sweetened with sugar and especially with blueberry, more rarely with other fruits or honey or served unsweetened. It is also used for milk or sour desserts, together with the forest berries typical in Estonia and Finland.

Finland,39af8f,adventure_hat,5,Thu Jun 11 07:23:31 2015 UTC,"I went to school abroad and started learning French in first grade. Still had other stuff in Finnish and spoke Finnish with friends and family so it was no problem.  Didn't get anything mixed up and got along better with the locals as I could now communicate with them.  I learned English through movies and video games, and only started learning it in school at age 11. The ""late"" start didn't matter either as I speak it almost natively.  Overall, I think this would be a good thing. It's easier to learn a new language if you start it as early as possible. Been trying to learn some Swedish now (at age 20) since I didn't have it in school and while it isn't too hard, it definitely takes more effort."
Finland,39af8f,deadchucolacola,-4,Wed Jun 10 15:22:28 2015 UTC,I think that Swedish should be the first new language in school. It'd be easier to learn and almost everyone consumes English content and learns English faster because of that. I hope that this makes sense.

Finland,39af8f,deadchucolacola,-1,Thu Jun 11 07:38:40 2015 UTC,I know that there is no real reason to learn Swedish. I just thought that if it's mandatory it should start at an earlier age just because it would be easier. I had huge problems with Swedish and my Swedish sucks really hard.

A school in Finland can decide how they distribute them, but the total amount of English from 1st to 6th remains the same.  Source: wife's a teacher, I'd ask her the hour count, but she already went to bed. She and many other teachers actually don't think this English from the first grade is all that good an idea, because it makes it a little sparse. This causes several grades to have only one hour a week while languages might benefit from some intensity. (also, iirc, there's the notion that 1st and 2nd graders need to learn to learn first also their mother tongue needs work before language studies, but sure, there are people and teachers that disagree and think the benefits from an early start outweigh the downsides)  Edit: Also she's dead certain it'd be better to start some other language first / early. English is something a Finnish kid learns no matter what.It starts at 3rd the latest even if another language started in 1st or 2nd grade. I think."

When I switched to another school, one that's supposedly language-oriented, for third grade when most kids start studying a foreign language for real for the first time, we weren't actually allowed to pick English at all but had to choose between French, German or Russian.  English classes didn't start until 5th grade, and I'm assuming they were counting on us learning the basics outside school anyway (from games and books to subtitled TV). I don't think anyone really struggled with English even though we started so ""late""; it was easy to get started after already learning how to study a language before, and because it's just so easy to immerse yourself in English just by turning on the telly."

Finland,391z2s,GuitarAbuser,13,Mon Jun 8 17:47:35 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine that the article already says part of the reason why it is so good (where it works anyway):   But here’s the odd thing: Most Helsinkians have little need for free Wi-Fi. Finns receive the most generous data allowance from mobile operators for every euro they spend, according to Politico.    If people had really crappy mobile internet connections, they'd all be using the free wlan instead of them. In such case the fast wlan would not be fast."
Finland,391z2s,elmokki,3,Mon Jun 8 20:02:39 2015 UTC,It could still be pretty fast they would just have to invest a bit more to increase the speeds.
Finland,391z2s,CastorTrollux,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple. WLAN is limited to about 80 MHz of bandwidth  and there are many many other applications also using it. The small cell size helps with capacity reuse but in general WLAN speed is a limited resource. You can't  ""just invest"" around telecommunications theory."
Finland,391z2s,Elukka,2,Tue Jun 9 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"Sure you can. Invest in more wifi hotspots, that will distribute the amount of connections per hotspot and reduce the strain on the WLAN. I'd agree if everyone was using the exact same hotspot, but the only reason people would do that is if the hotspot is only available in a few locations rather than being ubiquitous."

You will likely get a military summons close to your graduation date. I think I received mine around December/January of my senior year of HS.  This is the easiest way to move to Finland. I wasn't a U.S. citizen at the time though, so I am not sure whether they will bother sending you one.    If that doesn't pan out for some reason, you could try and apply for a university program that's geared towards foreigners. My sister completed her Bachelor's in the U.S., and then decided to go study in Finland for her Master's. She applied and got accepted into a MS. biology program at the University of Helsinki, and is just about to finish.

Exploring Åland and biking is a nice combination. You get to spend time outdoors, the scenes are nice and the distances aren't too crazy.  Lapland is beautiful too, but I don't know how many Airbnb apartments and such would be available. Also, distances are longer and public transport not quite on par with Southern Finland."

It's also on the cards for us to head down to Riga for a few nights, but I haven't heard much to sway me either way on that.

Finland,38wnhy,talvituli,6,Mon Jun 8 00:32:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I would skip Lapland if you're doing Estonia, Turku, and Åland. The distances are big up there, and you would probably need a car to travel. And unless you get cheap flights the train takes a really long time, which is exhausting."
Finland,38wnhy,talvituli,4,Sun Jun 7 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's mosquito season in Lapland and it's quite far off from everything else so skip it.  Take the cheap OnniBus to Turku instead. Spend a day or two exploring the city. Then rent some bikes and bike to Mariehamn. It's a great scenic route. From Mariehamn you can take the Viking or Silja ferry back to Turku.  For good beer in Tallinn check out Uba ja Humal (bottle shop), Hopner, Speakeasy by Põhjala and Pudel Baar. The Red Emperor is a good cheap hostel in Tallinn."
Finland,38wnhy,Jugiboy,2,Sun Jun 7 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for these excellent suggestions! How long would you estimate that ride takes? And do you recommend booking intercity buses and ferries beforehand, or are they usually ok to get at the time?  Also that hostel looks really cool."
Finland,38wnhy,talvituli,2,Mon Jun 8 00:24:01 2015 UTC,You could do it easily in four days. Here's an example. First day Turku-Kustavi around 70km of biking. Second day Kustavi-Bomarsund 40km with plenty of ferries. Third day Bomarsund-Godby with detours for various sights along the way 50km. Last day Godby-Mariehamn and the ferry back to Turku 20km.  I'd book the Mariehamn-Turku ferry at least a couple of days in advance. The other ones don't require booking. Just check the timings carefully in advance and make sure you reach them in time. The Helsinki-Turku OnniBus is good to book some days ahead as it's cheaper that way and it can also sell out from time to time.  Edit: as an example if you book the OnniBus now for a day in late July it'd cost you just 1€ each way.

Finland,38wnhy,Kyesah,2,Mon Jun 8 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"Day trips from Turku to Åland are more or less impossible to make worthwhile, you need to stay the night (depending on your time, more than one certainly is not a bad idea, either). Most attractions are found on mainland Åland, the biggest island, which is roughly five hours away from Turku by ferry. As has been suggested before, biking to Mariehamn is a good option if you want to see the archipelago, and it should be pretty easy to do.   I'll give Åland a very warm recommendation, then again I've visited every year up to when I was 13 and a couple of times since."

It might be better to have a couple of days in Turku, and maybe try to ferry to Åland for a night. Would you say that Turku is a nice/interesting city to explore for a day or two? And thank you for the info!"
Finland,38xd52,CommanderCode,5,Sun Jun 7 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on the speed, saunalahti 4G is 25 Euros/month for 1 year for unlimited calls/sms/Data. 3G is for 20 Euros/month up to 6 months.   Prices are quite similar across the board. However, sometimes it is also possible to negotiate  better price with customer service agent in case you are shifting from another operator.   If prices are similar, I would go with the operator who is offering non-binding contract, which is mostly elisa/saunalahti. For best network coverage, I believe that Sonera will be a good option. DNA has a very good english speaking customer service."
Finland,38xd52,simputer,5,Sun Jun 7 18:00:00 2015 UTC,Sonera is the only operator at the moment with data caps. I'd stay away from them.  Other than that it's pretty much what /u/simputer said.

Finland,38sd01,jamesh08,14,Sat Jun 6 11:47:13 2015 UTC,You don't need to if you have a time-based pass on your card. The only transport mode you need to swipe for if you have a pass is the bus (as you enter). Metro and tram you just need to have your pass with you. If you only have value loaded on your card then you need to purchase a ticket by holding your pass to the reader and pressing the desired button as you enter the tram.

Finland,38sd01,Oldini,8,Sat Jun 6 12:17:07 2015 UTC,"Though the first time you board a tram after you got the time based card you should swipe it. that activates the card. If you haven't swiped the card at all, your card will not be activated and you may need to pay the fines if there's an inspector.   Swiping the card is pretty easy, you just hold it to the reader, between all the arrows on the bottom part if I recall right how they were arranged. You will need to hold it there for a while so the reader can activate it."
Finland,38sd01,istwan,3,Sat Jun 6 20:33:28 2015 UTC,A big thank you to you and all the folks that just reminded me to activate the card by holding it up to the reader.  I never did that and now I know what to do next time I get in the tram. Thank you.

Finland,38sd01,Pengothing,4,Sat Jun 6 21:10:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely swipe it the first time you use it, since that activates the ticket. Otherwise you might have trouble with the ticket inspectors.

Atleast in the case of a phone ticket you don't have to show it to the driver or scan it. However there is random ticket inspections based on roaming ticket inspectors and you have to show your ticket to them. If you don't have a ticket and get caught, you have to pay a rather hefty fine."
Finland,38sd01,Harriv,5,Sat Jun 6 12:02:05 2015 UTC,It's like the metro. People just gamble and hope they don't check tickets because they do it so rarely.

Sex is not something we wait for long (for example, I believe losing virginity is much bigger deal for americans, but that could also be the non-realistic teenage tv series) and it often becomes part of the relationship quite early.

You should maybe push him a little in case he's the classic inhibited Finn, and try to be patient, if you really like him.  The dating culture here is very different from the US and young Finns have this strange tendency of slowly drifting together through friend's friends, work, hobbies, etc. Everything can be a bit vague here about progressing through friendship, dating, sex and a relationship. It can drive Americans crazy that things are so open-form, slow and just plain vague. Not every Finn is like this though but the more reserved kind can be infuriating. Could just be his personality, who knows, but the situation might not be hopeless, if you guys work on it."

From what I've been able to gather, American dating seems to be a lot more formalised in the sense that people often stress out about questions such as ""is this a date?"" or how manieth(?) date it might be. While people in Finland certainly do go out on dates, it's far from being the only way of building a relationship.  Other than that, I'd be hesitant to make a move on someone if I knew we'd be separated by on ocean immediately after that moment."

If he's anything like me, he's simply really bad at reading you, and essentially will require more than subtle hints to make a move for fear of freaking you out.  My recommendation to you is to take a suitable moment to ask, ""Why haven't you kissed me yet, you dolt?"""
Finland,38p4ih,keepfrgettngmypsswrd,3,Fri Jun 5 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you, that is really validating. I think I may gently inquire with the question you just so eloquently posed :)"
Finland,38p4ih,variaati0,2,Fri Jun 5 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"This one here is one good example of how American (or some other cultures) dating scene can be different.  There's also studies on the matter. Finns on average have less sex than Americans on average.  So I don't know, it could be that if you're getting it on six ways til Sunday and all the people whom you know as well, then maybe you're not an average Finn when it comes to sex."
Finland,38p4ih,Banker_gaming,5,Fri Jun 5 21:22:44 2015 UTC,I'm an American dating a Finn. She usually needs a little extra push to express her emotions. Men can be pretty shy here.
Finland,38p4ih,variaati0,20,Fri Jun 5 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"Saying Finns are shy can work well enough for a shorthand, but I'd say it's more about the sometimes absurd levels of self-restraint and respect for other peoples personal space.  Might look a lot like shyness for you, but then again a lot of Americans have a strange problem about being nude in sauna with strangers. Cultural differences."
Finland,38p4ih,namo2021,20,Fri Jun 5 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"This, I would agree. Many people in in Finland are ingrained with the very deep sanctity of other peoples personal space and respect for other peoples person and body. This can go to the ""don't even touch without permission"" level. Basically they assume a ""no"" on any permissions,  if the person doesn't clearly say or indicate ""yes"".   So a finn may not read even flirting or hinting as an permission to move forward, because it is not a clear ""yes"". They might very well know, that you are flirting and very well know it is a hint of a permission. They just think ""a hint of a permission"" is very far away from a clear permission and gives them absolutely no right to assume any right to move further into other persons personal space.  If according to OP the person is not otherwise shy, he might be in a ""holding pattern"". Basically staying close because they care about the OP, but not willing to move forward without explicit invitation, out of respect and fear of causing a violation OP's personal space limits.  For males is mostly caused by the finnish culture, where it is ""normal"" for women also to take initiative. Some men won't take the initiative out of respect, because it is not absolutely necessary to be ""aggressive"" based on the culture. Some might call it a form of chivalry, others might call it indecisivess and stupidity. :)   The thinking is, that the female is just as capable of making personal decisions in the relationship as the male and she will let the man know, when she has reached her decision regarding the continuation of the relationship. So the man will stay close and available, but will leave the decision to the female out of respect.   As person above said, this can go to absurd levels. If the female also decides to stay in holding out of the same chivalry until male makes a move, you get a relationship variant of the""blind"" mexican standoff. :)"
Finland,38p4ih,namo2021,8,Fri Jun 5 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"This is further enhanced since finnish culture has absolutely no ""dating rules"" like the Americans have. There are no first date, second date or so on rules, so things can reeeeaaaaally drag out if neither makes the first move."
Finland,38p4ih,juhae,2,Sat Jun 6 08:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think the american term for this would be ""It's complicated""."
Finland,38p4ih,Harriv,5,Sat Jun 6 11:52:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have heard it described that everyone here is so respectful of everyone else's personal life that they don't offer outward help, because it might be seen as an invasion of privacy. Although I've had experiences where people just use the word ""culture"" as an excuse to not help. Even one older lady whose job at Elisa was to help! I'm guessing it was because my Finnish was so bad at that point that I needed to use English so she didn't want to deal with that.   But that is the exception to the rule though, as most Finns I've met are outstanding people who will go the extra 1.6 kilometers when you ask them. No matter where you go, there's gonna be a jerk or two."
Finland,38p4ih,trua,3,Sat Jun 6 04:54:45 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. It's so culturally different than what I'm used to (I live in a big city with big personalities all around me) and I find Finnish culture to be rather refreshing.
Finland,38p4ih,anonypanda,3,Fri Jun 5 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"It was refreshing for me too, for a bit. But living here for over a year, it starts to wear on me.

Finland,38p4ih,Nixumoi,-1,Fri Jun 5 20:57:37 2015 UTC,I can understand that. Americans have an innate warmth to them and such a natural willingness to be open and friendly. Hopefully this won't be too much of a culturally difference to make it work long term. Best of luck to you!

I don't mean to say it necessarily isn't so, but this is somewhat often viewed as superficial politeness and empty words among Finns.  Maybe it's the lack of culture for smalltalk, the aforementioned respect for personal space, extreme politeness or a combination of those and who-knows-what.  And of course I'm generalising to a degree you shouldn't draw any conclusions from my words."

It just depends on manufacturer, if they go to the trouble of using multiband antennas and radios on their devices. From what I gather multiband radios are of course little more expensive and complicated to implement, so many manufacturers rather just create multiple cheaper models with area specific bands.  Iphone 4 has cdma and gsm models. gsm model will work in Finland.  The GSM model contains a 3G penta-band umts radio with 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100 MHz bands.

Finland,383ceb,Holyrapid,6,Tue Jun 2 07:34:27 2015 UTC,"There's an extra ""ka"" in there, but without it, it sorta makes almost sense.  Ratsastusmestaritar = female rider master (chief rider?)

Finland,383ceb,mievaan,4,Tue Jun 2 13:03:49 2015 UTC,Having just started week 3 of my Finnish course I can say: I understood parts of that word.
Finland,383ceb,phelyan,4,Mon Jun 1 20:08:32 2015 UTC,It's explained in the description if you want to understand it all.
Finland,383ceb,sosern,5,Tue Jun 2 03:48:07 2015 UTC,"Not completely accurate. ""Juoksennella"" means ""to run about""; not necessarily aimlessly or randomly as the comic suggests. More accurate translations would be:  I wonder if I should run about aimlessly = Juoksentelisinkohan päämäärättömästi (päämäärä = destination, päämäärätön = without destination)  I wonder if I should run about randomly = Juoksentelisinkohan sattumanvaraisesti (sattumanvarainen = random/incidental)"
Finland,383ceb,ninefingers79,11,Mon Jun 1 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"I sort of disagree. You can't really ""juoksennella"" with a specific aim, the meaning of the aimlessness, or randomness, is contained in the word. You can't really say, for example, ""juoksentelen kauppaan""."
Finland,383ceb,mievaan,4,Tue Jun 2 06:43:30 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree with you, however if you kind of switch between running and walking several times on the way couldn't that be described as ""juoksennella""? I don't know, it sometimes is a silly language."
Finland,383ceb,Hardly_lolling,4,Tue Jun 2 07:01:06 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but to me, if there is a specific point you are heading towards all the time (e.g. the shop), then that isn't ""juoksennella"". ""Juoksennella"" is bursts of running toward several directions. But yeah, it's a funny language."
Finland,383ceb,mievaan,3,Tue Jun 2 07:12:02 2015 UTC,"""Juoksennella"" is bursts of running toward several directions.   Nothing in the word implies directions."
Finland,383ceb,jotenjoten,3,Tue Jun 2 08:00:36 2015 UTC,"if you kind of switch between running and walking several times on the way couldn't that be described as ""juoksennella""?   I would describe that as ""juoksahdella""."

Finland,383ceb,Hardly_lolling,3,Wed Jun 3 06:11:13 2015 UTC,I would say you can. It feels like you're intermittently running to the store.    Kaunis päivä. Juoksentelisinkohan tänään pihallani nauttien puutarharuiskujen pärskeistä.
Finland,383ceb,jotenjoten,6,Tue Jun 2 07:58:08 2015 UTC,"To me, if I had to interpret ""juoksennella kauppaan"", it would mean doing a random zigzag running pattern toward several directions, that happens to end up at the store. But that still doesn't seem like a correct way to use the word. So to me, there is a definite random direction aspect to ""juoksennella"". But ""juoksennella pihalla"" sounds like a perfect use of the word, and a great activity on a sunny day."
Finland,383ceb,mievaan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:30:54 2015 UTC,"As per this blog-post (http://telefinn.blogspot.com/2012/05/running-around-aimlessly.html):   the ending ""-lla"" is ""a deverbial suffix for creating frequentative verbs"" apparently. This means it turns a verb into a more repetitive, more leisurely or less goal-orientated version of the original, e.g. ""ostella"" (to shop) derives from ""osta"" (to buy). That's how ""juoksennella"" ends up meaning roughly ""to run around aimlessly"""

Finland,37w83e,andywarwool,11,Sat May 30 22:32:25 2015 UTC,"I know of Helsingin Urheiluvälinehuolto and Uusix that sell used bikes. HUH is at Malmi (train N and buses 70T and 70 take you there from the railway station) and it shouldn't be hard to find with Google maps.   If you need to get around Helsinki with public transport, use HSL search. HSL also has a Cycling and walking journey planner if you need to get around Helsinki with a bike.  I'd say, get a used bike. From the shops you and I mentioned, each sell bikes that are tested properly. The prices for bikes from Uusix were 50€ and up, and to me it sounds like an okay price.   The address for Uusix: Kyläsaarenkatu 8 J   and for HUH: Malminraitti 2  For restaurants, check Eat.fi (click top left for EN and MAP)  Hotels in Finland: tripadvisor  Here's a guide on how to use the emergency number in Finland: 112  Finnish weather info: Ilmatieteenlaitos  Some lightning info: FLC  If you forget to take essential outdoor/camping gear with you to Finland, this might be the shop for you: Partioaitta  I hope this helps. This is all I could think of off the top of my head."
Finland,37w83e,igorbubba,2,Sat May 30 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"Truly excellent reply, thank you very much! You've answered questions I didn't even know I was asking. :-)  Regarding the bikes, would you say I better buy it from a shop, rather than buying from the actual owner (Ebay style)? I'm asking this because I did it in Germany, and while I admit the bike I got was not the best, it was much cheaper than any bike shop (and I can only assume that had I put more thought and time into it I would have gotten an even better bike). 50€ might even be too cheap for me; I'm no expert when it comes to dual wheel vehicle pricing in Finland (or any other Scandinavian country for that matter), but considering it needs to sustain me and some luggage for up to three weeks, I would assume a reasonable price to be 100€ and even more.  Regarding camping gear, I actually forgot to mention I will not be taking anything with me from home, and am planning to buy everything in Finland. I assume Patrioaitta is still the place for me, and thanks for letting me know; question is, what do you think I need to buy? I thought about a tent, mosquito net and a camp stove.  Another issue I keep forgetting to ask is phone and data service; seeing that I'll be travelling alone, I'll most likely buy a local SIM card with data plan. I've found this, and as to my understanding they can all be easily purchased and activated at R Kiosks which are fairly common, at least in Helsinki. I'm just wondering what's your opinion on that, and I also wonder how's their coverage in the rural parts of Finland, as I'm probably going to spend most of my time there. In addition, I may spend some time in Norway -- is there a chance I'll get any service in there using a Finnish SIM card?  Thank you again for all your help! :)"
Finland,37w83e,igorbubba,3,Sun May 31 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"It's just a personal preference to buy from a bike shop rather than huuto.net or tori.fi because I trust that the bike shops know when a bike is really safe to travel with, especially long distances.   Your camping gear needs depend on your plans; do you want to camp, or stay in hotels? What and where do you eat? Will you be fishing or picking mushrooms and blueberries from the forest? (I don't know about fishing permits etc. But I think you can fish freely with DIY fishing poles, that have like a hook for worms). I'm on my mobile so I don't have links, but I recommend that you buy a Sawyer mini filtration system or a water filtration bottle (from Amazon?) before you come to Finland because they are either very expensive or not available here (yet, I don't camp at all, so I don't really know about the availability of camping gear in Finland). Google something like ""camping gear infographic"" for a better list, but I'd say you need   a good hydrophobic backpack/bikepack a tent a rollable sleeping mattress gore tex / hydrophobic outdoor clothing a sleeping bag water bottles (aluminum) a gas/oil heater / matchsticks a pan a swiss army knife fork/knife/spoon multitool bike repair eguipment a spare inner tyre or two good sunglasses check out Zenni Optical a rain jacket desinfectant and first aid stuf a map (preferably a navigator / GPS phone, since you could have an emergency and you really need to know exactly where you are, if that happens) bar soap wire to hang your clothes with to trees  mosquito spray (you'll learn to hate them in Finland if you don't already).    You can buy a prepaid SIM card for your phone or even a cheap phone from R-Kioski, like 50€ 34,90€ for the combo. I once met this german girl who had money on her Skype account (search for Finland) and she made all the phone calls with her macbook. That would work in Norway too. I think that the prices for a prepaid are 0,08€/minute/text, so check which one is cheaper, prepaid or Skype. When you call a finnish phone number, remember to replace the first 0 with +358 i.e. 050 1122334 becomes +358 50 1122334.   Sorry for the lack of links, I hate making them with my phone. I'll answer more questions later, if you have them, to the best of my knowledge and google-fu. Hopefully these give you ideas to be better prepared for a bike trip in Finland :)   EDIT: Formatting and links, just to be polite :)  EDIT 2: More links"
Finland,37w83e,igorbubba,2,Sun May 31 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your replies! They are extremely helpful and encourage me even further to explore Finland on my bicycle :)  I understand what you're saying about buying a bike from a bike shop, and given some thought I believe you're right, especially after I sort of got screwed in Germany for buying it directly from the owner.  Regarding my camping, I thought about mixing camping and staying at hotels. For food, I'm not going to fish for sure, and actually picking mushrooms and berries from the forest sounds cool (how can I tell they're not poisonous?), but as I'm not planning to completely exclude myself from other humans, I guess that like in my previous trips I'll occasionally eat at restaurants/street food, and buy simple food from the supermarket. That gives rise to the question if I even need a stove, but I guess I'll see when I get there :)  Thanks for the list! I will follow it when I pack my bag. That got me wondering -- what clothing should I take with me? Should I expect rain showers, winds, cold temperature? As I said I'll be there from the end of July to mid August.  I'm actually planning to take my smartphone with me, so I'll have a navigator and all of that, so all I'm looking for is Internet and perhaps just a little bit of minutes (so I could call hostels and stuff like that) -- I don't think I'll use Skype much because I'm not planning to talk over the phone back home (just WhatsApp and stuff like that). So my main concern is getting an Internet connection, in Finland and hopefully in Norway too.  Again I wish to thank you for your time and effort, I cannot put into words how much I appreciate it. Have a wonderful weekend!"
Finland,37w83e,igorbubba,2,Sat Jun 6 11:10:53 2015 UTC,"No problem :) I'm glad to help.  Here's a list of some of the berries that are edible in Finland:   Lingonberry / ""Puolukka"" in finnish European Blueberry / ""Mustikka"" Crowberry / ""Variksenmarja"" European raspberry / ""Vadelma""  Cloudberry / ""Lakka"" Cranberry / ""Karpalo"" Rowan berries? / ""Pihlaja"" (note: these are very sour, diuretic and used as a laxative; might have uses in travelling though) Common sea-buckthorn / ""Tyrni"" Northern bilberry / ""Juolukka"" Arctic raspberry / ""Mesimarja""   Products made from finnish berries are often sold at market squares in cities and towns and I highly recommend that you try them out. Sweet jams, juices and bakery products often have finnish berries in them. I don't know anything about mushrooms or how to prepare them. Check this site out for more information. Some of the edible mushrooms could be mixed up with psilocybin mushrooms so I just avoid them all, because I'm not good at identifying them, even with clear instructions. Berries I know, but all the mushrooms look the same to me and I can't think of many more horrifying things to happen than tripping in a finnish forest alone.  It might not be a good experience to venture out in the swampy forests in finland to find and collect berries (unless you love camping/hiking), since the forests are often dense, moist, full of mosquitos, black flies, horse-flies, ticks and mining bee nests. I always hated collecting berries as a child because every god damn insect in the forest wanted a piece of me. I do heartily recommend buying a bottle of 'Free' mosquito/horse-fly/tick repellant first thing when you get here (note: 'Free' is the product name and it actually costs money to get it :D). It's the best I've used and it's mostly scentless and available in most supermarkets and grocery stores.  Here's a short list of some grocery stores in Finland:  Mostly food and some basic stuff like light bulbs, batteries   S-market, K-Market, K-supermarket, Siwa, Alepa, Valintatalo, Lidl (probably the cheapest)   Hypermarkets, mostly in bigger cities   Prisma, K-citymarket, Tokmanni   Remember, you cannot buy alcohol between 9pm - 9am in Finland (we're drunkards, we need limits) so avoid going to the checkout with beer at those hours or everyone will look at you like you're about to rob the store or that you're trouble (slight exaggeration, but I think you should know this :D). Also, only the government owned Alko is allowed to sell alcohol products that have more than 4.7% alc. vol. in them and the wines and liquors are mostly expensive due to high taxing. If you want to try the finnish way of drinking, also known as ""lantraaminen"" (diluting alcohol with sweeter beverages), you could buy a Leijona hard liquor bottle and mixing it with cloudberry juice from the market place. That's an experience in itself and you'll get a lot of teenage friends doing that.  For the clothing part, expect to be burned in the sun (if you have a light skin) and soaked to the skin within the same day. There are no hurricanes or earth quakes here (knock on wood) but the weather is crazy sometimes and I've been beaten by a hailstorm while riding a moped home from the beach one summer. For a general idea, pack light, warm, gore tex and something that doesn't let the wind through. A baseball cap is a good idea. The finnish weather varies easily within -30°C and +30°C between seasons so we're never happy. Weather is something we complain a lot about. Here's a good site about the weather in Finland and a quote from there: 'Be prepared for rapid and extreme weather changes, no matter where and when you go.'  For the smartphone internet, you need something with 4G tech to put your mind at ease. 3G works too, but you'll have connectivity problems especially traveling in northern finland. I think navigating works without 3G/4G with GPS but a good choice for a 4G cellphone plan is prepaid (sorry the site is in finnish, but the Sonera Easy Prepaid costs 9,90€ and has 7€ for phonecalls, texts and internet usage and extra 100min for phonecalls (or +8€ for everything) totaling 15€ texts/calls/internet. Using the internet costs 1,91€/Mb and a maximum of 1,91€/per day, so if you're using more than 1Mb in a day, use the hell out of it). The prepaids are ""recharged"" either at R-Kioski or an ATM (at least ATMs used to have that functionality) and phonecalls & texts cost 0,08€/min/text. There's also a ""Sonera Prepaid nettikuukausi -liittymä"" which is 31 days of limitless internet usage for 24,90€ but it doesn't have pricing for phonecalls/texts so it might only be meant for laptops and 3G donglemodems (no idea what they are in english).  I guess this is all for now phew. I'm here for more info still if you have any questions :) when we're through I'll probably ignore /r/finland for 6 months or so (I check it like biannually, I guess it's lucky that you asked about bikes now). I'm kind of procrastinating from work while writing these posts haha.  Anyway, have an awesome weekend too!"
Finland,37w83e,igorbubba,2,Sat Jun 6 13:24:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks again! I really hope you're not doing it just for me and these posts will continue to live on to the next bike tourist to Finland. :)  Thanks for the list of berries, I'll keep photos of them and try to identify them as I go :) I like berries myself though my area doesn't have such variety so I'm very curious. I must say I haven't heard of many of them, and am especially interested in those berries that seem to be unique to the area like Mesimarja. Should I expect to find this vast variety just anywhere in Finland? Is it safe to just pick it up and eat, no washing or anything? Are there any poisonous fruits I may accidentally confuse them with? Don't want that to happen ;)  Speaking of washing, while I may not have to wash fruits, I will most likely want to wash myself from time to time (still, you know, biking and everything :D). I assume lake water to be clean and the area safe enough to just drop my things on the shore and go for a swim or a wash?  I think I'll take your advice and stay away from mushrooms :) Finnish nature and language may give me a trip good enough without any chemicals involved.  I have been warned a lot about those tiny, living, flying, annoying objects! I really appreciate you have a website dedicated to flies repellents. Will applying that every so-and-so hours be enough? Is there anything else I can do to keep the bad guys away?  Thanks for the list of markets! I always look for them when I'm abroad (for some reason I like buying in foreign supermarkets, and if I'm in the right mood, sit outside it and eat lunch like a bum :D). I'm actually quite surprised about the strict alcohol regulations! Having only one place selling hard liquor sounds so strange to me. Which gets me to this -- while it may not be the healthiest thing to do, I used to like to finish a day of hard biking with some alcohol. I tried the local things -- in Germany and Austria it was either locally brewed beer or herbs liquor, and in Italy I had lots of Limoncello. What would be the Finnish equivalent, in the sense of unique/national alcohol? Would that be the Leijona spirit mixed with sweet beverages?  I understand complaining about the weather is a popular hobby in the North :) My original plan, in order to minimize my odds of having rain showers or any other forms of bad weather, was to fly from the last week of July till mid-August. How do you like that?  Thanks for the details about the Internet. I'll probably just buy a package that sounds right -- considering flight, bike and everything around it, another 10 Euros here or there won't make much of a difference ;) I'm still wondering if it's possible to get a bit more expensive package, but to get it to work (roaming?) in Norway too. Otherwise I may have to buy a Norwegian SIM as well, depending on how much time I'm going to travel there (I'm planning to take the Eskelisen Lapin Linjat bus from Oulu or something to northern Norway, and bike around Tromsø, Nordkapp and possibly Lofoten -- any ideas?).  Two more issues that came to my mind -- first is regarding the Finnish fauna -- should I be afraid of any dangerous animals such as reindeer, wolves, other forms of what my amateur non-experienced eye will identify as bear? Perhaps snakes? How should this threat, if exists, affect my camping? What do I do if I just, you know, bike around and these guys block my way? Is it even likely?  Another issue I must say I am a bit embarrassed I haven't pointed out yet is the saunas! I must admit I've never been to a sauna, but as you may assume I have heard a lot about Finnish saunas. I understand it may even be good for my biking! What do you assume may be my sauna options on the way?  I'm glad for you you can use /r/finland to procrastinate from work! For me it's the other way around, because of work I can't spend as much time as I wish on /r/finland. Only shows how badly I need this vacation! :)  Thanks again and have a great week ahead!"
Finland,37w83e,igorbubba,2,Sun Jun 7 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I doubt that these will go any farther than this, but at least there's something to link to if anyone else decides to ask about these things :)    Should I expect to find this vast variety (of berries) just anywhere in Finland?   As I said, I hated going to the forest and my guess is just as good as yours, but I think the blueberries are the most common berries in finnish forests (at least in the swampy forests). Most of the berries I linked are some that I've never seen in the wild and I used to go around forests in the lower central finland, Jyväskylä and such. Mesimarja is most seen around Kymi and Kuopio, which is a bit to the north-east from Jyväskylä. And yeah, I'd just eat the berries, especially from forests. If you're unsure, gently cleaning them with water or a cloth should do no harm. About the poisonous berries, I accidentally found a pretty good site for both healthy and poisonous berries, so you might like to check it out.   I assume lake water to be clean and the area safe enough to just drop my things on the shore and go for a swim or a wash?   Well, I've washed in the lake water numerous times as a kid. I recommend buying tar shampoo and tar soap because they just smell and feel so... I don't know, finnish? I love their smell. Found in most supermarkets and they're supposedly great for any hair and skin. They go very nicely with a sauna. As for safety. It will need some very bad luck to get your stuff stolen. You could have an analog burglar alarm by attaching a loud bell to your belongings which will keep a loud noise would your stuff be moved. You could tape the bell's hammer to not ring when you're biking. The bell will have other purposes, which I will come to later.   Will applying fly repellants every so-and-so hours be enough?   Yeah, you should apply the 'Free' mosquito repellant every 4-6 hours to your bare skin (not mouth/eyes/nose though, haha) and thin layers of clothing. I recommend the spray version. There are other brands of mosquito repellants, but I've found 'Free' to be the most effective and least bad smelling.   Is there anything else I can do to keep the bad guys away?   Mosquitos are drawn by carbon dioxide sooo... Don't exhale around them? :D   What would be the Finnish equivalent, in the sense of unique/national alcohol?   The thing is, every national finnish beverage pretty much tastes like shit besides 'Sahti'. We have Jallu, Kossu, Finnish beer brands (that to me taste cheap), Lonkero (this is actually quite okay if you like really sweet beverages) and what else. Oh yeah, Sahti which is my favorite of finnish curiosities. It's like a beer that tastes like banana and doesn't have carbonic acid (the bubbles). If you're biking around Lahti, be sure to get a taste of the real sahti. The sahti that they sell in Alkos might not be as good.   My original plan, in order to minimize my odds of having rain showers or any other forms of bad weather, was to fly from the last week of July till mid-August. How do you like that?   It's already somewhat warm in here (meaning summer is coming and so are the weathers) so either come as quickly as you can (like right now, there haven't been any rainstorms or lightning yet) or be prepared to ""extreme"" weather. None of the weather effects are extreme to me, but I don't know about people who don't have the finnish tough skin or who are camping when it's raining. Like in my previous post, be prepared to all kinds of weather, no matter the season or location.   I'm still wondering if it's possible to get a bit more expensive package, but to get it to work (roaming?) in Norway too.   Yeah, the prepaid SIMs should have roaming available. Norwegian teleoperator is Telenor and it may have slightly higher prices than using the SIM in Finland only, but nothing drastic. Here's a thread about roaming stuff with a DNA prepaid SIM. My wild guess would be that texts/callminutes are like 0,10€ when roaming, but it's prepaid, so you shouldn't be able to overcharge it.   should I be afraid of any dangerous animals such as reindeer, wolves, other forms of what my amateur non-experienced eye will identify as bear?   Here's where the bell comes in handy. If you're unsure that you might encounter the dangerous triplets (bears, moose and wolves), you could have a bell ringing in your backpack. I know this is silly, but none of the three animals enjoys encountering humans, so letting them know where you are might help them get out of your way. If you do surprise them and get them aggressive, here's some info about what you can do.   If you encounter a curious bear, a non-aggressive one, don't run away. Either play dead by lying on your stomach, legs spread and keeping your hands over your neck or make slow waving motion with your hands to appear bigger, talk to the bear softly (so it will recognize you as a human) and back away slowly. If the bear seems aggressive, make sure you're not approaching her cubs when you move away. Be still and calm and don't run or move quickly. It might do a fake charge, but mostly they do not want to attack you unless you further intimidate them. A bear spray might come in handy, but these are expensive. Just don't venture deep in to woods and you'll never see a bear. There's like 1500 bears in finland, so the chances of you biking in to one is slim to none If you encounter a wild moose/deer/reindeer, just keep your eyes on it and possibly get next to a tree. Enjoy the sight, these are not common. Usually they'll flee when they notice you are around, and their mating season is around august so you shouldn't find male mooseses thinking of you as competition for the females. The tree is just that if the gets close to you and tries to harm you (pretty much never happens) you can maneuver around the tree easier than the moose and make it leave in frustration.  If you encounter a wolf, don't turn your back. Try to leave the area and the vicinity of the wolf. If it's getting aggressively closer to you, try to seem big and make loud noises, throw rocks next to it. Make it think that attacking you isn't worth it. If it attacks you, don't back away or expose your neck. Only wolves that are sick or protecting their cubs attack people and that hasn't happened in finland after the 19th century. When you get away from a seemingly dangerous situation with any wild animal, call 112 and inform them that an aggressive beast is going about in that area, and they'll send people to take care of it.   And no, it isn't likely that a wild pikachu appears in finland, unless you sneak up on them. Use the forc... bell, Luke... Andy.   What do you assume may be my sauna options on the way?   Most of the public indoor swimming pools have saunas in them, and of course, the spas. The swimming pools cost like 2-5€ per visit and the sauna is included in the price. Spas are more expensive, but you might like to visit one just for the quality. One great trick to finding a sauna is to become acquainted with a finn and saying ""I've never been to a sauna in my life"" and just stating that will get a reaction like ""Really?!? We'll warm one up and drink beer and put sausages on the sauna stove and drink some kossu and arhgraagagllbrbr perkele vittu saatana (finnish curse words) hahaha!!"". Take advantage of the finnish hospitality if you can :) Especially with saunas.  It's been fun writing these posts. I don't care much for karma but if even a single person benefits from every post I make, that's enough for me. I spend a lot of time alone and not often do I find any interesting subjects to talk about with the people I meet, so this is something I could do more :) Again, ask away if you have something that bothers you.   Have an awesome week and take care!"
Finland,37w83e,shitcock55,2,Mon Jun 8 01:23:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm already running late for work so I don't have much time, so I'll only reply to the most crucial issue for me now and reply more properly later today -- regarding the flights, if I better change I need to do is ASAP (for getting travel permits and cheaper flights). Would you really say flying nowadays is better than my plan (late July-mid August)? It's just that I've seen my dates been recommended so very often. My trip will probably be from a Friday to 22 days later's Saturday, and if needed I can probably leave next Friday. In some sense it's even better because that way I'll be able to attend the wife carrying competition! I'm just scared it may still be cold/winter-ish (here we haven't fully reached summer yet, and Finland's non-summer-seasons are scarier than in here...) So what do you think?  Cheers and talk to you when I get back home!"
Finland,37w83e,Harriv,2,Mon Jun 8 04:50:28 2015 UTC,"If the july-august dates are actually recommended, that is your best bet. It's not actually super warm here yet (to me it's always too warm) so you might not enjoy it. So don't change your flights yet. The moose mating season was in september actually, I just can't remember the names of months even after 19 years of speaking english. But it shouldn't even be the reason to do anything differently. July-august is the time it gets around +20-30 degrees celsius and to me it's really warm. To you it's probably just barely tolerable :) I'm actually late too, so this is just to reassure you that your original dates are probably the best compromise between all the factors, also known as the finnish weather."
Finland,37w83e,maunoooh,2,Mon Jun 8 09:02:21 2015 UTC,"By the way, it just rained and thundered in Helsinki a few hours ago. It lasted for maybe an hour :) now it's a bit windy, chilly and cloudy but clear."
Finland,37w83e,maunoooh,2,Mon Jun 8 14:07:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, finally (past 1AM) I get some time to properly read and reply...  Thanks for the berries site! The variety is amazing to me and surely I'll look for them. I'll try to stay away from the poisonous ones though... ;)  I must say that I scratched my eyes when you mentioned tar soap -- perhaps I don't know what tar exactly is, but translating it gives me the same word you use to describe the coating of car roads, which seems to me the most dirty thing ever. But it certainly looks interesting and I'll look for it when I get to Finland! Please excuse me if it's an ""amateur question"" or something, but is it okay for me if I just happen to find a lake, lock my bike and get in? There's no chance I'm violating any laws there? We just don't have many lakes around here so the rules aren't really obvious to me. The bell idea sounds cool! I'm really glad the crime rates in Finland are exceptionally low (and I assume even lower in rural area) so I'm calmer than I was during my bike trip to Italy.  Regarding bugs and such things -- I actually thought that if the weather may be right and the ground fit, I may want to sleep right on the ground (I live in an urban area and really want to feel nature), not sure what I'll wear. Should I be afraid of insects or ticks or something if I sleep on the soil in a forest? That leads me to another question, where would you suggest me to camp? I'm pretty much clueless when it comes to camping, but I see that many roads are just asphalt with nothing but birch and pine trees surrounding it, so I figured that when night comes I'll just try to find a spot free of trees big enough for a tent and far enough from the road. What do you think? If needed I'll try to hold my breath ;)  Thanks for the alcohol recommendations! I knew Finns wouldn't disappoint me on that note, although I must say my (limited) experience with Vodka hasn't been so good. I don't even see the appeal in it. But I'll try all that stuff, banana flavoured beer sounds interesting :)  I've seen your other post regarding the dates so I'm keeping my original dates (I actually should really book flights already... I'll probably do it July 24th till August 15th) Do you happen to know if there are any interesting festivals or something? I saw there was a music festival on July 24-25 in Turku, and they'll even have Lau Nau which I sort of like.  I'm glad to see roaming is possible in Norway, so at least I'll be able to send text messages when I'm there. I really hope I'll find a way to get 4G data there too, as I wouldn't want to purchase a Norwegian SIM card as well (also I understood it requires more bureaucracy than in Finland and there's nothing I hate more than bureaucracy).  Thanks for the instructions per how to deal with wild animals! I'll surely keep them in mind, so if you hear about a tourist being torn to pieces by one of the triplet, you can be safe knowing your words were the last things that went through the poor guy's mind :D  Having saunas in swimming pools sound so convenient! I'll surely test it out. And don't worry, I'm already acquainted with the words ""perkele vittu saatana"" :)  There is one more thing that bothers me, and you seem to know what's up so I figured you'd be the right guy to ask. Although I have already chosen my destination country and my dates (pretty much), I must admit I don't REALLY have a plan as to where to go on Day 1 or what I mustn't miss. As you can see in my previous /r/finland post (linked in OP), I've got some recommendations which I'll take into mind, but I'm also curious as to your opinion. The only thing that is (almost) certain is that I'll probably spend around a week, give or take, in Norway (taking the Eskelisen Lapin Linjat from Oulu) -- probably do Tromsø to Nordkapp, and possibly get to Lofoten (or bike from Tromsø through Skibotn to Finnish Kilpisjärvi). I also understood it is recommended to do Lahti-Jyväskylä (along the Vanhanselkä), Turku and Åland Islands, and Punkaharju and Savonlinna. What do you think? Consider I could probably do around 100km per day (probably more if I get a proper bike and assuming the roads are flat). I'm also quite interested in the whole ""forest culture"", I can definitely see myself spending some time just walking around forests like in here.  Thanks and have a great day!  P.S.

From there you would learn what ship they took to get in. You could then cross reference with under what name they booked the ship in the Europe.

It used to be quite common for Finns to take a surname that was literal or partial translation of their Finnish name when they immigrated. Maybe you could get some inspiration from that.  Also, is there any family member who would know more about your grandparents? What was their hometown, for example. Because there's quite many genealogy/family research sites in Finnish that list people who immigrated to America.

Perfect, since so many Finnish surnames are landscape names, it should be easy to pick a sort of translation that fits that. Those sorts of names tend to be very common and no one would mistake you for being in some small circle of relatives that have a rare surname. If you prefer it to be generic you can just use the basic word for the geographic feature (eg. ""Järvi"", lake - whence ""Järvelä"", ""Järvinen""), but you can also make it more unique by modifying that with the specific name of the feature. Example:  I have a MMORPG character with the surname ""Haarajärvelä"" because of this random lake I visited in Canada called Fork Lake.

Finland,37r05v,klasu-m,14,Sat May 30 14:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'd estimate that most of Finnish surnames come from names of places, denoting a specific geographical region within a certain limited area as can be deduced from the link u/Dareat provided (small correction to that: 'poro' means reindeer and is not too common of a surname, the surname 'Peura' signifies a regular deer.)  Before the Swedes and the Russians actually started to chart their territories within the borders of modern day Finland, there isn't a record of people even having a surname. Oldest church records resemble mainly the Icelandic tradition of naming, sons and daughters bearing their fathers name as their last name: Isaksson - Isaksdottir (Isac's son, Isac's daughter).  At first, and perhaps for the common folk surnames didn't necessarily signify a specific place on the map, but more in the lines of general geographical features. For example surnames like Vuori (Mountain), Mäki (Hill), Laakso (Valley), Järvi (Lake) and their derivatives signify relatively simple concepts denoting their bearer to a certain limited and easily identifiable area. Once the territories within Finland began to have established names and a formal class structure was introduced by the Swedes dividing people into nobles, land-owners and lower classes it became more important to bear family names. It was easier to have larger and also more important families to bear a name that could be demarcated from other last names based on general geographical features, and so a lot of names either came from already established Swedish family names or perhaps signified that their bearer already belonged to a larger tribe within Finland, such as might be in the case of names like Hämäläinen (NN from Häme / NN of the Häme people/tribe) or Karjalainen (NN from Karelia / NN of the Karelia tribe/people).  If you want to pick a brand new surname for yourself, I'd suggest you go with the general geographical features. Live by a lake? Järvi, Järvelä, Järvinen are all perfectly ok. A mountain? Vuori, Vuorio, Vuorinen. Not too complicated, perfectly fine and legal and doesn't create confusion.  A few family names are protected, and even if I don't know whether your country allows you to change your name to those, you can't change your last name into them unless you're directly related. Depends on how courteous and polite you want to be. Getting names wrong, taking an established family's surname is kind of out there as one of the worst things you can possibly do even if it was unintentional. We don't really have nobles or any kind of nobility in here, but for instance if you'd switch your name into Sibelius or Waltari and came prancing around with that name in here without actually being of those families, people would get pretty cross with you (not that you'd necessarily notice).  Best option would be if your grandparents last name already seems a bit like it could be a translation or altered into the language of your new country to make it more palatable for the locals. Or you could go with the Icelandic/old Nordic naming custom, just take your fathers name, Swedify it (Henry -> Henrik) and add a '-son' in the end if you're male or '-dottir' if you're female. This way you get Henrikson/Henriksen, or Henriksdottir for instance. The suffix '-dottir' is not necessarily that common anymore in Sweden, Denmark or Norway and definitely not common at all in Finland, but still works perfectly fine in Iceland.  And yea, one more thing...Finland's not part of Scandinavia. That's a teensy bit like you'd be saying that Finland belongs to Sweden. Not that we mind about it that much, we're usually just extremely unimpressed by this show of either your lack of proper education, or your blatant disregard for correct nomenclature, or your imperialistic tendencies. It's not a big deal, just something enough of us Finns feels obliged to correct every single time. :)  If there's anything you want to ask, do so, and for other readers who might be more knowledgeable about the topic, feel free to point out the errors."
Finland,37r05v,tiikerikani,4,Fri May 29 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much.   And yea, one more thing...Finland's not part of Scandinavia.   I know - but, I have both Finnish and Scandinavian heritage.  I don't have any intention for taking somebody else's surname - it would be rude even if it's legal - and sure, I don't have any intention to switch my surname to Sibelius. =)  I'm curious, is there any surname that is Finnish but also sounds like Scandinavian, or I don't know, are surnames can be Scandinavian words with Finnish suffixes?  Also, what are the options if I don't want to go with landscape names or matronyms (somebody's son-daughter) options? Also, can surnames be portmanteaus?"
Finland,37r05v,popojala,4,Fri May 29 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"Here's a handy list for reference of known Swedish family names which have been translated or transformed into Finnish surnames: A list of ""Fennified"" surnames (in Finnish). The transformed name is presented first, original name second.  Also might bring out some of the difficulties with making a portmanteau/frankenword surname. Although it is possible, and the easiest ways would be with the suffixes such as -nen, -la, -mo, -io, or -s, you might get some interesting results that way. Matt Damon works as an example, it's fairly easy to imagine him still carrying his Finnish ancestors changed surname, it could be changed from something along the lines of Temonen/Timonen -> Damon (even though Damon is probably a very British or Irish name, I think). But yeah, Matti Temonen, it's not a Scandinavian name, but definitely just about as Finnish you can get.  The problem with the Finnish surnames that also sound like Scandinavian is that they basically already are Scandinavian. As you can see from the list, the original Swedish names are quite different from the Finnish form into which they were translated. Hyphenation solves the problem to some extent, of course, so for example a patronym Andersson/Anderssen and Lahti (Bay) would make a perfectly palatable hyphenated surname of Andersson-Lahti, which also works pretty well in US, both of those being common enough especially in the Midwest.  If you don't want landscape names there are still some options, although making the surname to denote both Scandinavian and Finnish ancestry can become even trickier. The good thing about Soldier names(in Finnish) is that since they come from Royal Army of the Swedish Empire, they can both very Finnish and very Swedish. Tapperla or Raskio for instance would be a reasonable portmanteau signifying both ancient military history of the family, or the rank of the original surname bearer, and also Swedish and Finnish ancestry.  edit: added the last bit"
Finland,37r05v,L3D,3,Fri May 29 20:26:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was very helpful. =) Thank you so much. Maybe something like a soldier name can be my answer. Also, do Finnish surnames always specify families roots - like, if it's Lahti, is it always mean that that families' ancestors were living by a lake or it's some kind of naming tradition that comes from shamanistic roots?  Also, is it a proper sounding surname if go something like a soldier name, let's assume x and Saari like x-Saari or it's going to be weird for a Finnish surname?"
Finland,37r05v,cosmicsunreindeer,7,Fri May 29 23:50:43 2015 UTC,"For long time Finns didn't have surnames. People we're called things like Olavinpoika (sonf of Olavi)  the same way Icelanders still do. When Finns had to choose surnames they usually chose the name their house was called, like Mäkitalo."
Finland,37r05v,klasu-m,3,Sat May 30 09:15:15 2015 UTC,"I think u/popojala made very salient points about the slash and burn agriculture vs. stable residences of the Western Finland. Names based on generic geographical features most likely denote the lesser importance of the family and quite possibly an effort concerning census and taxation, makes it that much easier if you can locate at least the family by their surname and have some kind of point of reference to geographic.   Although there is a possibility that some of the older animistic/shamanistic cultural strata has passed on in naming conventions, it's still important to remember that the use of surnames becomes an established practice mainly through the introduction of Christian traditions. The Eastern surname conventions seem to follow the practice of taking for instance a name of a cape and putting the suffix -nen. It's an interesting notion that perhaps a few established Eastern families might have derived their names out of specific strategic vantage points such as capes and straits within the Finnish Lakeland.  Hyphenation can work, but as with other Western cultures carrying two surnames signifies that you want to retain both of your respected and established families names, or that you're a child born out of two notable families being joined together by matrimony. It's also not that common of a practice, so there's a slight chance for few people here or there looking at it as slightly eccentric. But otherwise there's not really a reason why you couldn't go with it, it's a bit unconventional, but still perfectly reasonable. Really depends what the surnames actually are how much of a mouthful they turn out to be, for instance Granlund-Saarelainen could be a tad too rich."
Finland,37r05v,L3D,3,Sat May 30 09:34:20 2015 UTC,"Hyphenation can work, but as with other Western cultures carrying two surnames signifies that you want to retain both of your respected and established families names, or that you're a child born out of two notable families being joined together by matrimony.    Not necessarily so. There is at least one famous case how this kind of hyphenated name was invented for a new-made nobleman, mostly because it just sounds aristocratic: Eliel Soisalon-Soininen got his ""double-name"" when he got knighted by czar, and I think it was invented almost out of thin blue air; the first part sounds like it refers to a place called ""Soisalo"" (I don't know if he had any real connections to there, however), and according some internet sources the surname ""Soininen"" might have been used in his family before.   However, it isn't usual ""combined"" surname (that are of the form ""firstsurname-anothersurname""), but the first part is in a genitive form (so it sort of means Soininen-of-Soisalo). I think there are couple of other similar ""aristocratic"" names. However, I don't know if a faux-aristocratic name would really suit OP (especially given their family history; if  grandparents were in red guards, I doubt if they would have approved.).  There are also another kind of surnames that got hyphens in them: Ylä-/Ala-/Keski-/(...)-Surname (meaning Upper-/Lower-/Middle-you got the idea...-Surname) that stereotypically have some kind of family history behind them: Suppose a large estate called 'Marttila' got divided between two sons (usually the older one would get the old house and another would build a new house in the portion of land he got); for example, depending on the geography of the partitioned area, the other house might have began to be called by a name like ""Ala-Marttila"" (or maybe keep on being called ""Marttila"") and the new one ""Ylä-Marttila"" (assuming the new house would built uphill relative to the old one.)  (Or something like that, I'm not exactly expert on this so take that with grain of salt.)"

These are often older than the names taken after rivers, lakes and hills when western Finland got last names instead of Patronyms.   Eastern Finland and Savo especially has older surnames than western Finland. I don't know, but apparently it has something to do with the slash and burn agriculture and the need to tax that more mobile population. In western Finland people where known by their fathers and the houses they were living in."

I like Australia in Eurovision. They have a bigger number of people watching the contest than many participating countries have people, full stop, and that's before they even dreamed of participating. As far as I'm concerned, they could very well be invited to the contest to stay. China is looking at participation (but won't for quite a while due to the low number of viewers), and if they start fulfilling some criteria, then welcome. I'd be okay with a system of exceptions as well, with different countries getting shots at ESC - the problem is that few countries outside the EBU full members broadcast the contest (a requirement to participate), and none come close to the viewership of Australia."

Finland,37mmow,Vaultboy462,47,Thu May 28 19:09:00 2015 UTC,Umm. Sami people don't live in Karelia. Karelians and Karelian Finns live in Karelia so you should probably think about the setting a bit more.
Finland,37mmow,deadchucolacola,10,Thu May 28 20:02:52 2015 UTC,"But they probably did in the distant past, right? Not sure how far back the OP is thinking.  ""before contact with southerners (i.e., the outside world)"" sounds pretty ancient too."
Finland,37mmow,ponimaa,22,Thu May 28 20:26:20 2015 UTC,But there aren't any real records about the people who lived there in the ancient times. We know that there were Finnic tribes living here then but no real information about the language or culture. We know about the comb ceramic culture but not much more. It's not quite right to assume that they were sami people back then.  Edit: /u/reuhka provided a neat pdf which shows that sami people indeed lived in Karelia. My interpretation of distant past was just a tad different. I bet that the people who lived there 3000 years ago wouldn't qualify as sami people.
Finland,37mmow,deadchucolacola,11,Thu May 28 20:39:32 2015 UTC,3000 years ago Proto-Sámi probably had not even split from the Proto-Finnic language.

Finland,37mmow,reuhka,2,Thu May 28 20:41:00 2015 UTC,Not sure how far back the OP is thinking.   I think it's pretty obvious. OP's talking about times when the Sámi used to inhabit regions now known as Finland and (Eastern) Karelia.  I hope this thread doesn't turn into an awkward discussion about who was where first…
Finland,37mmow,QpH,4,Thu May 28 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I wanted it to be pretty vague - a nameless tribe in a nameless country, so to speak. I was using Sami as a catch-all term, so thanks for the pointer."
Finland,37mmow,roveboat,8,Thu May 28 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"Finno-Ugric or Finnic tribes might be a more appropriate term for those pre-historic times, as Sami refers to a particular tribe. If you're basing your text in Karelia, the Karelians would be the obvious choice - them being the 'original' (as far as we know..) tribe in Karelia. Note that Karelians in this sense are different from Karelians (Karjalaiset) in Finland, who are ethnic Finns living in the parts of Karelia on the Finnish side of the border.  Good luck, and don't forget to link the finished piece to us!  Edit: noticed you're not really aiming for prehistoric times, around 1600 there were no Samis in Karelia anymore.

Finland,37mmow,onkko,7,Thu May 28 21:02:23 2015 UTC,There are some old connections between Sami and Karelia. For example this is the coat of arms of city of Lappeenranta in Southern Carelia (name of the city means literally 'strand of Lapps') and this is the coat of arms of Lapland.
Finland,37mmow,jukranpuju,8,Thu May 28 23:14:48 2015 UTC,"There is more than that, both languages come from proto-finnish what is anchient finnish.   And there was no lapps or finns then, just tribes. Most likely is that finns absorbed lapps due way better life. Who were lapp in that time? Could it be Hämäläinen/savolainen etc?

Finland,37mmow,vobscura,7,Thu May 28 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"So few reindeers, mainly used as bait for wild ""reindeer"" or as transportation. No herding. Hunter gatherer. In 1607 there was 70, yes only 70 reindeers in huge area, and only few tor family and most didnt have any in inari area.  If you want more reindeers and organised herding you have to get finns in that because finns did that. Norway and Sweden soon closed borders when finn inspired huge crowds of reindeers spread ate all. Lot of them done by samis tho.   Do you want to write fact or fiction? You do know that sami and finnish are from same root language (proto-finnish) and today you cant tell one apart. There is of course genetic differences because finns were on shores while sami were inland so finns have much more european influences.  I do know few sami, differences in culture.... none. To be honest i were only one to actually ""almost own"" reindeer herd. Im a finn from lapland and my family has been here atleast since 1630.  Fact is what i know. Sami people were here so were finns, finns adopted to farming while sami stay in hunter gather and drifted to woods. Finns won in culture war and assimilated samis.  You cant say who is a finn and who is a sami if you dont count extreme examples.  4y me gathered food for reindeer, sheeps and cows with elder, its time long gone.   If you want cultural hints, kid gets knife (puukko) when he is about 5, i still remember mine and how i ""had"" to hide that i actually cut my fingers :)"
Finland,37mmow,onkko,2,Thu May 28 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"So, does this mean then that by the (say) 1640's, Finns were herding large groups of reindeer along the coastlines? Because that would work quite well. Would they be on the coast, or on inland lakes?  This has been really helpful to clear up discrepancies, thanks."
Finland,37mmow,iholuvas,2,Fri May 29 07:41:18 2015 UTC,"No, reindeers are northern species. Herding came about same time when finns migrated to north, bit different since house/farming but anyway."
Finland,37mmow,0_0_0,1 point,Sat May 30 00:21:19 2015 UTC,"The reason there aren't many visible differences between Sami and Finnish culture is because of the assimilation which you mentioned in your post. It doesn't mean there aren't actually any differences, they're just not very visible because the Sami people were taught to be ashamed of their language and culture. Children weren't allowed to speak the language in schools, they were sent to housing facilities to keep them away from their families. My aunt, who originally spoke Sami as her mother tongue, still cannot speak a word of Sami because she was so traumatised as a child. My father was never even taught the language because my grandparents refused to teach him (because of a need to protect him or because they became ashamed of their culture, I still have no idea) after it was made clear that the Sami people were 'dumb' and should act more like Finns to be considered proper people.   Also, Finnish and Sami (there are several languages within the Sami language group, but I'm using the term generally here) do most definitely have differences. Have you ever heard anyone speak Sami? Did you understand them? Yeah, didn't think so. There are similarities between the languages, but they are still distinctly different.  As for OP, if you really want those reindeers, I'd suggest changing the setting to Lapland. Also, it's great that you're interested in the Sami culture! If you're going to write specifically about the Sami people, though, the only thing I ask is that you do your homework properly and thoroughly. Here is a link to a service where you can have all your questions answered by a person with extensive knowledge of the Sami language and culture (also of Finnish origin peoples and their culture, language etc.).

These economies are strong because of a multitude of reasons, of which renewable energy is only marginal or not-existent.   Whereas especially in the case of Russia and China, being tied down to fossil fuels does hinder their economies.   Fossil fuels are cheaper than renewables, however that's hopefully slowly changing. Germany has the second highest (behind wind-powered Denmark) electricity prices in Europe. The price of renewables is simply transferred onto the customer. China has some of the cheapest electricity in the world thanks to using little renewables. The good news are that they have increased construction of wind and solar in recent years. The recent development is not the source of their well-off economy though.  Russia is ""tied down"" because they sell oil and gas, both of which have taken strong hits in the oil-price war and the war in Ukraine.

Which was the case with Russia, at least up to the point when they reduced funding for the police.  It was means to an end, government officials found it very easy to take money on the side, corruption ran rampant because the officials weren't paid enough. Consolidation of power was then fairly easy by means of violence instead of legal means because the system no longer supported unbiased court proceedings and people were no longer equal in front of the law. Those with capital could buy the verdicts they wanted and buy the cops to look the other way. Violence ran rampant because it was cheap, efficient enough and perhaps even the last resort within an unjust and corrupt system.  One of the most important functions of the government is to build, uphold and support a functioning infrastructure. Russia failed on this on so many levels.

Just because last two winters have been exceptionally warm, we remember the proper way to dress."

It might be nice and sunny when you leave home, but it can be snow and wind when it's time to walk home.   It's exactly the same where I'm from - yet we don't dress like that. >:)  It's also one thing to wear your jacket loosely on you with the zipper undone or scarf hung over the shoulders to carry it, but another to have the jacket zipped up and scarf wrapped up around you like it's already snowing.  I lived in Edmonton for 9 years, which, according to Wikipedia, gets an average of 28 days below -20°C annually. We only truly bundle up below -10°C."

This is why people have a lot of clothes with them during early summer: http://cdn.fmi.fi/weather-observations/products/graphs/observations-874863-4-fi.png This is the weather past 48 hours. It is very chilly in the morning and evening.  Someone mentioned that the fact that it's not ""June"" or ""Kesäkuu"" literally meaning ""Summer month"" and this is why us Finns don't wear lighter clothes is very true. Just wait until the 20th of June when it's the Mid Summers eve and after that you wont see people wearing a lot of clothes.  Also the weather like the previous person mentioned is very volatile and people like to get prepared, it's similar to carrying an umbrella even when it's not raining. This was Mid Summers eve here in southern Finland last year: http://is13.snstatic.fi/img/978/1288702669052.jpg  Sure there's some odd behavior but there's that in every single country.

Finland,37cx7o,wlanmaterial,-1,Sun May 31 02:46:27 2015 UTC,"You've completely missed the part where I've said that carrying extra clothes is not the same as wearing them. You know, it is possible to wear/carry a coat in warm weather without zipping it up and wrapping a woolen scarf around it.   (My hometown in Canada is also notorious for having huge changes in temperature through the day, my family has a lot of trouble keeping our vegetable garden for this reason. We typically go from 20+ degrees in the day to near 5 at night in a summer day.)  I was here last Midsummer. I saw people carrying their raincoats with them in case they were needed. They didn't wear them the entire time.  The statistical climate evidence does not convince me since it is not sufficiently different enough from what I experienced in Canada growing up to account for the differences in the ways people dress.  Sure, there's always oddballs (I would totally go running in shorts in winter if I were a runner), but non-longsleeves/coats wearers were a minority last week."
Finland,37cx7o,GutterMaiden,3,Sun May 31 04:47:44 2015 UTC,"The thing is that Finns do wear only t-shirts when it's 10 degrees but only if the calendar says it's June, July, or August. They have this weird sense of weather and season inertia, where they can't seem to wrap their minds around the fact that, if it's 15C outside and sunny in March, you can in fact wear a t-shirt.

So, I'm happy that we finally have a course and can get to work.  It's kinda like tearing one hell of a bandaid quickly. It's gonna hurt for sure.

The rules for työeläke (work income based pension) were changed in 2005 and people in the baby boomer age cohorts in fact did not pay their työeläke in full. The payments slowly ramped up in the 60's-80's and the people who got in on the system early received an unfair advantage. Furthermore with old people, only their income for the last 10 years of their working careers dictated their work pension level.   This is not fair. They did not work for their full pension.

Finland,37f6dj,Elukka,1 point,Wed May 27 06:39:45 2015 UTC,"Myself and two close family members have had issues. One of them had a small operation done in Belgium. Most EHEC treatments have to be paid by you and then reimbursed some time (at least in Belgium). He filed for reimbursement and after long dispute process only got around half the money back. Another family member had severe flu in the Netherlands and the doctor refused to see him when using EHEC. I was in Austria having a neurological urgency and the doctor said I can't get MRI with EHEC, I need to go back home to get it. So yeah, as far as I can tell there are many issues."
Finland,37f6dj,TheSodesa,1 point,Wed May 27 08:29:49 2015 UTC,ok. in Finland it's safer that you go to public healthcare and avoid private clinics if you wish to use EHEC. Otherwise you propably end up getting covered up until to the price of same treatment in public healthcare and the rest will be yours to pay.
Finland,37aix2,iamwizzerd,14,Tue May 26 04:50:20 2015 UTC,"Comics. Especially when you've got the basics of Finnish, or if the plot line is relatively easy to follow. For instance mainstream superhero comics are usually pretty straightforward so it's not too difficult to figure out what they're on about.  Good comics for learning languages could also be the classic originally French language BD such as Asterix, Lucky Luke, Piko & Fantasio, Ankardo (orig. Canardo) and Tintti (orig. Tintin).  Read them in Finnish, have a dictionary or a translator at hand, or pester your Finnish SO what the words mean if you can't follow the plot otherwise."

I'm sure you've already learned some words (and maybe even sentence structures etc) through just hearing Finnish spoken around you, so imagine the progress you could make if you concentrated on that instead of going the book route!  To practice on your own, I'd recommend Selkouutiset (= 'clear news') from YLE, you can find plenty of texts and matching audio to practice with and there's a new one every day. There's also Tosi helpot selkouutiset (= 'really easy clear news') if following along the regular ones is too much. Of course, going through these will be a lot faster too if you have a Finnish speaker to work as a living dictionary and grammar guide.

Finland,36xi4m,numpadwarrior,16,Fri May 22 23:02:43 2015 UTC,It's what happened when they started teaching English at school and in the curriculum they never actually paid attention to pronunciation.
Finland,36xi4m,m4lic,8,Sat May 23 04:04:37 2015 UTC,If that's how it sounds when a Finn speaks English with Finnish intonation. :P Sometimes I feel like I sound like a machine gun.
Finland,36xi4m,m4lic,10,Sat May 23 07:13:26 2015 UTC,"While I agree that character and uniqueness is important, language education should address pronunciation purely for the reason that conversation with people of other nationalities would be easier for all concerned. For example, you would have trouble understanding a foreigner speaking Finnish who cannot roll their R's, do not understand the difference between double and single consonants, and pronounce letters according to their own linguistic background (like J's in Spanish and Finnish sound completely different)."
Finland,36xi4m,ardzu,2,Sat May 23 07:29:20 2015 UTC,"But English is a completely different case, bad English is the world's most spoken language. Even weird accents are understood in big cities and holiday resorts (read: the places where people with only mediocre skills in English might end up having to speak English) because all the people have their own weird accents. It's the same thing with work-related contexts, outside the Anglosphere people speak with their own strong accents and understand bad English as well as or even better than 'correctly pronounced English' (that is, how a white person from England or USA would pronounce it).  Rather than focusing on pronunciation, in my opinion it would be more important to focus on actually expressing oneself in English. (Of course the basics of pronunciation and the sounds that don't appear in Finnish should be explained et cetera.) A lot of time, at least a few years ago, the oral exercises are about reading a written conversation or answering written questions. In such a case one doesn't really the produce the material oneself and express one's own thoughts in one's own vocabulary. Thus the necessary practice for conversing in English is not really created: it's easy to read out loud written text in a foreign language, but holding a conversation is a whole different beast. To summarise, it's better to speak bad English confidently than to shy away from demonstrating one's perfect BBC English; it's easier for the other party to understand what you're saying if you're confident in expressing yourself, be it with a Finnish accent or not."

Otherwise it should be returned to owner or to the police. If it's too big (like bicycle), notifying the police is enough.   Police departments have annual bicycle auction, where found bicycles without owner are sold. This the only legal way I know. The law specially mentions that founder cannot keep found bicycle, but when it's sold in auction founder will get 1/3 of the value.  That's how it goes by the law."

Finland,36w3of,Harriv,10,Sat May 23 19:21:08 2015 UTC,The planes alone aren't the only cost. I'm fairly certain maintenance and replacement part deals aren't included in the unit price.

Finland,36w3of,Onicle,12,Fri May 22 18:02:51 2015 UTC,Throw in a maintenance deal for 10-15 years minimum.
Finland,36w3of,Rankkikotka,13,Fri May 22 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way: if you buy a car and a part breaks, you take it to a repair shop. In the Air Forces case, they are both the car owner and the repair shop. And the gas station and the driving school and the car mechanic school... So one doesn't simply buy a plane and be set for life."
Finland,36w3of,Harriv,2,Fri May 22 21:32:08 2015 UTC,It's not with the airplanes. They consume huge amount of parts since nearly everything will be replaced during the life cycle of the planes. Also every part has to be 100% so they are swapped often
Finland,36w3of,juhamac,1 point,Tue May 26 09:53:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but according to my calculations they could almost double their current planes, and that's just 2015-2030"

Cafes: Pyynikin torni cafe, in Pyynikki hill. Off center, so ask some nice single lady/dude from office to show it to you.  Cafes: ""vohvelikahvila"" traditional old place in the center. Service is very slow (like 60mins for a crepe). Ethnic: Borneo, malaysian food near tammelan tori square.  Pubs: Check the street corner of verkatehtaankatu x aleksanterinkatu.

Maybe they have customers in Swedish-speaking areas, just want to be ready incase someone needs service in Swedish or something, I don't know.

At least it feels that way when I spew sentences around me.  If fennoswedes = finlandssvenska (?) I have a hard time to understand it too sometimes. Easiest for me to understand is the finnish they use in kuopio/jyväskyla. I spent most of my younger days with my mom and her parents who are from those areas. Although my father is from Turku I can have a hard time to understand their language (dialect?) there sometimes.

Dialect spoken in Jyväskylä resembles most the standard written Finnish so that's the good starting point. Then again Savo dielect which is spoken in Kuopio is far from it. Shortening the words is typical for Turku dialect. There is a bad joke of how two person from Turku, Anna Mäki and Usko Kylmänen introduced themselves to each others.

I've got an education for tattoo/hair removal with laser though and I own a laser for tattoo removal. But I haven't studied if the finnish laws differs from the swedish laws and rules. Maybe should look that up somehow. Do you have anything like our ""strålskyddslagen"" and ""smittskyddslagen""?. Dno how to tranalate that correctly.  Since it will take me at least one-two years to move to save up some money, it would be possible for me to learn finnish. Both my parents are better at finnish than swedish, so they will probably only be happy to start conversating in finnish only. Guess that's a start.

This arises from many things, like Swedish speaking people being historically the wealthy, ruling elite, Sweden having more successful international companies and being generally perceived as more progressive than Finland. This is not at all helped by Sweden's better success in ice hockey.  I also think it's going to be damn hard to find a job.

The advantages of Vaasa is that it's the only truly bilingual city in Finland, most people in Vaasa know both Swedish and Finnish, and if not fluent they understand the other language. So therefore it would be a good city to move to if you want to learn Finnish.  Mother tongue stats for Vaasa is smth like 25% Swedish and the rest Finnish + some foreign exchange students.  Vaasa is a city where people go studying, I see you are 27 y/o and have no education, but if you would be interested in picking up school again, we have Yrkeshögskolan Novia (Högskoleingenjör, Företagsekonomi m.m), Åbo Akademis avdelning i Vasa and also Svenska Handelshögskolan Hanken.

The Center Party is way more rednecky than its Swedish colleagues, and they're run by a Lestaedian wing, and that includes our future PM Sipilä. They're also big on moving all of our government functions to the countryside, which over the past decades has been proven over and over again to be a multi-billion mistake. But they're going to do it anyway. Whenever the Center Party has been in power, their reign has always ended in a scandal, or in the case of Kekkonen, de facto dictatorship. Hence the saying ""the Center betrays always"" (Keskusta pettää aina). The three parties also welcome the foundation of a Finnish NSA, with Alexander Stubb actually pushing for it.

I nowadays live in Turku and most of my friends are either Swedes or Finnswedes here.  People don't hate Swedes, it's just brotherly love thing like someone said already and Turku is most likely the most ""Sweden positive"" city in whole Finland if you don't count Åland.   It's possible to find 1 room apartment with a sauna for 400e/month but then it's outside of the city centre. But if you spend something like 500e-600e/month (easy with job) you can get a really nice apartment with a sauna in the city centre.  All the neighbourhoods are ""decent"" in Finland, there are no real ghettos or stuff like in Sweden or elsewhere in the world.

There are quite a lot of that kind of contradictions which at first seemed to be irreconcilable, but still somehow seamlessly work in Finnish society.    For example like in spite of the world class education most Finns still prefer to see themselves more like a little bit rough rural type and act accordingly than a scholarly city dweller even if they live in the city and have higher education. Historically high status of women, Finland being the first country in the world which granted women full political rights, earlier than other Nordic countries while still usually considered more macho than them.

Finland,36popx,elmokki,7,Thu May 21 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"I believe the biggest factor is not whether you drink or not but rather how you think about alcohol. Sure, there are people whose idea of fun consists mostly of just getting drunk and you need a special kind of mind to be able to have fun when everyone else is very drunk. Then again, there are also plenty of people who might, for example, consider it fun to go to a bar and drink a beer or cider or something or maybe two and maybe get something to eat as well. If you're very loud about beliefs about alcohol being evil, yeah, no-one will want to listen to you. Similarly if you have some irrational fear of people drinking alcohol, you probably don't enjoy it. However, if you just order a coke or something instead of a beer it's a surprise if that's an issue to anyone. Someone might ask you about it of course though.  I don't really drink coffee just because I prefer tea, and that's seriously not an issue. Usually tea is available as an alternative, but considering it tends to be some atrocious Lipton tea bag stuff too often, sometimes just abstaining is a great idea as well.  TL;DR: If you choose your company well enough and aren't irrationally afraid of others using alcohol in moderate amounts, you should as fine as you would if you drank alcohol and coffee."
Finland,36popx,iholuvas,4,Thu May 21 08:59:00 2015 UTC,"I believe the biggest factor is not whether you drink or not but rather how you think about alcohol.   This so much.

It's all about you."
Finland,36popx,jusas,1 point,Thu May 21 14:43:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thoughts.  I actually like being around drunk people.  I just happen to know quite a few people in the US that do not feel comfortable unless I am drinking with them.  Or they insist that I cannot possibly be having fun without drinking.
Finland,36popx,tiikerikani,1 point,Thu May 21 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"It's very understandable that when there's one guy around who's not drinking it may make them feel uncomfortable. The reasoning is usually along these lines:  1) The guy is not drinking... why?  2) The guy is not drinking, does he somehow feel he's better than us?  3) The guy is not drinking, I bet he's just laughing at us being drunk inside his head  4) I don't like being around that guy because we're all gonna get drunk and he'll just laugh and tell embarrassing stories about us later ...  So I do get where it's coming from. Not everyone feels that way though. I'm perfectly fine with people not drinking, for me it's a choice. Sometimes I prefer to not drink or drink very little myself.  Whatever you do, just don't be smug about you not drinking..."
Finland,36popx,keepfrgettngmypsswrd,15,Sat May 23 13:58:45 2015 UTC,"It all depends on who you make friends with. I have several friends who don't drink alcohol at all (except a glass of wine at Christmas or something like that) and/or are also tea-only drinkers.  There are plenty of social opportunities that don't revolve around drinking (even with students), and even at those that do, there is almost always a non-alcoholic option so that non-drinkers can enjoy it too. Some of my usually-drinking friends sometimes take the non-alcoholic option just because they have an early exam the next day, or they don't want to spend the money, etc.; there's really not as much stigma against not drinking as one might be led to believe."
Finland,36popx,Nefera,2,Thu May 21 04:08:03 2015 UTC,Thank you!  That is reassuring.
Finland,36popx,Nefera,5,Thu May 21 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"Possibly one of the biggest differences with Finnish culture to some other cultures (perhaps especially American?) is that in comparison it seems that we Finns have an extraordinary amount of respect towards other peoples personal space. Basically in the context of this question it means that it would be hard pressed to find someone from here who would push either drinking coffee or alcohol on you. You have no obligation to drink either, and if you find yourself from this kind of a situation then you might want to have another go in choosing your company.  The general rule is that the older you and the people are in your immediate social circles are, and the more academically achieved they are, the less likely it is for them to ostracize you on the basis of your social non-conformity as long as you show a degree of respect and decorum towards other people. Not that there wouldn't be enough of value conservatives with a high level of social conformity in academic circles, it does depend highly on your field of science.  Drinking coffee's not really that much of a social event as one might expect from a country where we drink exorbitant amounts of coffee, the majority of coffee is drunk at home. Tea is always an option and if you don't drink tea, then you can opt for something else.  Not drinking alcohol's cool and will not make you a social outcast if you're still willing to spend time and socialize in situations where other people are drinking."

King Ralph is a 1991 American comedy film starring John Goodman in the title role of Ralph Jones.  The movie also stars Peter O'Toole as the King's private secretary, Sir Cedric Willingham, Camille Coduri as Ralph's girlfriend Miranda Greene, and John Hurt as the British peer Percival Graves, who schemes to get Ralph removed in order to claim the throne himself.  The story is loosely based on the novel Headlong by Emlyn Williams. Very little of the story survived the transition to the screen; characters were changed and the story made into a comedy.

If I remember right, Stark and his editor*** talked about the Finnish guy by his surname and the dialogue went something like:  Editor: ""What kind of name is that?""  Stark: ""Finnish.""  Editor: ""But I'm undone!"" (or something to that effect)  In one episode of MacGyver, he was talking to some old ladyfriend of his as they met again after a long time.

Finland,36o05q,ants_as_pets,4,Thu May 21 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"In the Coen brothers' movie The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) Tim Robbins claims to have studied Finnish and proceeds to speak some (total gibberish) only to get punched in the face by stockholder Thorstenson Finlandson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI2QZYWoxE0  During the Cold War it was very difficult or impossible for western film crews to go to the Soviet Union to shoot their movies and therefore Helsinki was repeatedly used as a ""close enough"" body double for Moscow or Leningrad. Therefore Helsinki appears in some big movies of the time but not as Helsinki.   At some point it was getting ridiculous. I remember how there was some high profile summit at the Finlandia Hall with all the attention of the international media while at the same time right across the street there was a movie prop red star beaconing above Helsinki on top of the National Museum tower.  Best known examples of that phenomenom are Warren Beatty's epic Reds (1981) and the spy thriller Gorky Park (1983). Also, in the 1965 epic Doctor Zhivago some of the winter sequences were filmed near Joensuu, Finland.  But there is also cold war movies with Finland appearing as Finland and Helsinki as Helsinki. Secret agent Harry Palmer (Michael Caine) movie Billion Dollar Brain  (1967) has been extensively shot in Finland as the film had all its location filming done in Helsinki, Turku, and Porvoo (as ""Riga"").   While the movie is cheesy it's interesting to see how Helsinki and Porvoo looked like in the winter 1967, and it's fun to see the appearance of well-known Finland-clichés and also product placements: https://youtu.be/pefAqlgs7K4?t=9m0s  Locations, and some related history:    1.Mannerheimintie between the Post Office and Lasipalatsi. Pirkko Mannola appears on the public phone, a well-known Finnish celebrity and actress at  the time. She was married to Åke Lindman who was often the go-to guy for foreing film crews.  2.Stockmann department store gets visited for some reason. Looks like it's the traditional winter sale of snowshoes. Good publicity for Stockmann and their reasonable pricing. I mean, a snowshoe is just ten ... fmks. And a mere five ... fmks gets you a nice pipo. Where can you beat those prices, nowhere I say! Only few fmks and you're all set for the winter.  3.Töölönlahti. Françoise Dorléac - Catherine Deneuve's elder sister - appears as Anya. By then she was about to break into international stardom but unfortunately died in a car crash shortly after the filming. This is her last movie which makes it all even more tragic.  4.Suomenlinna ferry. At the time Katajanokka was still a busy cargo port as one can see at the background but nowadays it's a home port for cruise ships.  5.Snowmobile ride on Laajalahti, a bay between Helsinki and Espoo, stopping on the shore at Tarvaspää. I can get why they're riding through those reeds instead of on the open ice right next to them. As a kid I used to go skating over there and loved skating through the seemingly endless mazes of reeds. Unfortunately riding a Canadian Ski-Doo is a missed product placement opportunity for Lumikko.  6.Akseli Gallen-Kallela's old smoke sauna in Tarvaspää which is great and a recommended place for relaxation if you get the chance to go there. The regular Finland-cliché of nudity versus a prude gets brought up. Yet it is commentable the characters are not wearing towels in sauna, especially in a smoke sauna, and that they avoid showing the cliché of skin-dipping in the snow or swimming in the icy water.  7.The Gallen-Kallela Museum exterior and interior. Complete with a Pallo-tuoli! This villa and studio of Gallen-Kallela gets revisited later on for more shots and admittely it is pictoresque. In fact it is a nice destination for a walk, a bike tour or a picnick. Do that sometime if you have the chance -  and in summer there's a beach right close by.  8.Kauppatori. Unsurprisingly, the address of Dr. Kaarna's recidence is close but not correct in the phonebook - the villa we'll see is not at Eläintarhantie 10 but close by at Linnunlaulu 7. As if that matters, but it's fun to see they're not using a completely fictional address. I bet Åke Lindman has something to do with that too.  9.Töölönlahti, Villa Kivi. Yeah, well, the villa has always been the lounge for writers, poets, novelists and other eccentric folks but an interior that whacky is obviously a studio set.  10.Senate Square, Sofiankatu 4. This is accurate as until 1982 there actually was a police station there housing the criminal police which investigated murders. As anyone who has seen a Palmu movie should know.  11.Car ride south on Eteläranta -> Laivasillankatu which suddenly makes sense as it's nearby from the previous location.  12.Car ride on an ice road but who knows where? There has been iceroads to Suomenlinna until the '80s but this doesn't look like it. Could there have been iceroads on Laajalahti in the '60s? Or between Tapiola/Westend and Lauttasaari? Or perhaps they merely created one for the film. Which is not entirely inaccurate.  13.Turku Castle. Fun to see it as a modern spy headquarters complete with checkpoints, super secret spy vehicles and an evil super computer terminal!  (nah, the interior is a studio set)  14.Uspenski Cathedral seen from top of the Enso-building. Yes, that atrocity existed already then. The cut scene to hockey players is from the game shot at the next location.  15.The Helsinki Ice Hall hockey rink. At the time it was brand new as it had been opened just months before in October 1966. Interestingly, the movie has two actual Finnish hockey teams appearing. And because hockey is the only really important thing in the movie I'll elaborate on that.    The team in the white-red jerseys is the Helsinki hockey team Karhu-Kissat. And the team in the dark jerseys with the crowned yellow R as their logo is the 1967 Finnish League champions Rosenlewin Urheilijat-38 from Pori. Here's them celebrating with the Kanada-malja.  That was also their last championship as the team soon merged with their rival Pori team Karhut, and the resulting team became known as Ässät - the team which we all have learned to love to hate. Excepting perhaps a small minority living in Pori who may or may not disagree with that.  The game is obviously not an actual league game as Karhu-Kissat did not play in the Finnish championship league but in the Suomensarja. It's a show game organised for the movie.   To have the Finnish champions RU-38 appear in a show game may be an obvious choise but I wonder why it's Karhu-Kissat and not some other Helsinki  team such as HIFK, HJK, or Töölön Vesa? Åke Lindman?  Also, Karhu-Kissat web site has a short article of their movie appearance with a cool picture of player Jussi Laine instructing Françoise Dorléac: http://www.karhu-kissat.fi/seuran_esittely/wanhoja_legendoja/ (And for her sake I hope she didn't smell her hands right after, RIP)  16.The Helsinki City Winter Garden and yes, it has a secret biological weapons lab too.  17.Porvoo as ""Riga"". Right across the river is the Porvoo old town. The steam locomotive looks like a Vr1. Those locomotives were in fact in operative use until 1975 but that particular train has probably been set up just for the movie. It's a ridiculously short ride of about 150-200 meters from Porvoo, nothing to Porvoo, Keskustan seisake. Both the start point and the end point are obvious in the scene. Anyway, nowadays there is a museum railroad in Porvoo albeit the stop we see here is no more.  18.The beautiful art nouveau/national romanticism interior of the hotel in Riga is actually the atrium of Helsinki Stock Exchange designed by Lars Sonck. And yes, it is awesome. And that is a very good reason to visit the bar in there just so you get to walk through the atrium.  Okay, these are the last two I'll do as the movie goes on forever:  19.Exterior shot with the olden gun is from Suomenlinna. Interesting to see the bad shape those buildings were in then. At the time Suomenlinna was still run by the Finnish Defence Forces and was transferred to civilian governance only some years later in 1973. Apparently renovating had not been a high priority task before that. There could be a lesson to learn hidden in there somewhere.  20.The pictoresque wooden houses are obviously shot in the Porvoo old town. You can tell that by the interior. All the houses over there are filled with chickens and onion.  All in all: What a boring movie."

I do find one important fact that punk might not carry onward on a larger scale. That is you need some kind of context, you need to get what ""it"" is in that song/band.  As punk is punk it carries the notion of little to none musical training so bands carry on ""raw expression"" rather than finesse.  Kind of an alternative jazz/blues.  That part of Europe who voted didn't get that message.  Punk as a genre can give us wonderfully deep music and artists that get famous for their ""vision"" and then technical/vocal skill follows through practice.  I do think these guys got enough fame to last them a lifetime so they can be happy with the media coverage of them.  As for ballads, yeah. I still can't understand why people vote for them. Eurovision should start doing ""themes"" or something for each year."

And even if they were open-minded musically, that would not have helped much since PKN is hardly ""music"". They don't know how to play. And their songwriting sucks. And no, i do not dislike them because i am racist and hate retarded people, but because i don't think it's a good idea to send a bunch of mentally handicapped punk-rockers who can't really play to a commercial popular-musics contest filled with those who gradually listen more to ""pop"". That is not a place for a handicapped punk-band."

Finland,36jnwu,GenericVillain,40,Tue May 19 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on where and the people you bathe with. Sometimes it customary to  take turns - men and women bathe seperately.  But with close friends and family ""unisex"" saunas are common... and no, I have never had or seen an erection in a sauna in mixed company. See - saunas aren't at all about that, it's a place for relaxing. Depending on the company - it is also a place for socializing and drinking.   Going back to the erections part: It is also considered rude to stare or look at other peoples ""bits""."
Finland,36jnwu,Blast-Attak,5,Tue May 19 22:04:15 2015 UTC,it's a place for relaxing   But there are people who don't exactly feel relaxed being naked in a sauna with others. Not because you'd be looking at each other but just because they aren't comfortable with that
Finland,36jnwu,Daantjeeuh,64,Tue May 19 22:17:29 2015 UTC,Then they're probably not Finns.
Finland,36jnwu,iholuvas,14,Tue May 19 23:12:54 2015 UTC,Well of course there are people of all kinds.   Personally I've seen enough people naked to 'just not care'. Not of being naked -- or seeing others naked.
Finland,36jnwu,Blast-Attak,9,Tue May 19 23:35:54 2015 UTC,Depends on what you've been accustomed to.

Finland,36jnwu,Lothwor,22,Tue May 19 22:05:01 2015 UTC,"As far as I know there are maybe three kinds of people who get erections in a public and/or unisex sauna: immature teenagers, skeezy perverts, and foreigners.  No offense.  Thing is, that if sex isn't down there as one of the last things in your mind when you're in a sauna, then it's not hot enough.  It might be just me but think of it as a bit like asking if it's a problem for someone if they're under medieval torture i.e. flayed alive, limbs crushed, drawn, quartered, forced to drink hot metal etc. and if it's a problem that they're getting an erection.  It might take a special kind of a person to get an erection in that kind of a situation, or maybe the torturer's really not putting the appropriate amount of effort into it."
Finland,36jnwu,keepfrgettngmypsswrd,7,Tue May 19 23:08:56 2015 UTC,I bet most foreigners are too nerveous to get an erection in an unisex sauna until they learn that it isn't scary to be naked.
Finland,36jnwu,elmokki,8,Wed May 20 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"Could be, it's just that as a Finn there's really nothing too special about being naked as such, everything is context dependent.  It seems very much so that for a lot of foreigners the only context for nudity is sex and sexuality. For us Finns, not so much, or very specifically within certain contexts and unisex sauna really isn't one of those."
Finland,36jnwu,keepfrgettngmypsswrd,2,Wed May 20 09:08:19 2015 UTC,"Well, a foreign immature tween here, no erections in sauna... focus is on surviving the heat and finding a seat in the lowest benches.Even if the sauna is moderately hot, somehow the setting is just not sexual."

People tend to avoid looking at each other that way in sauna and if it's a larger group of people it is viewed in much the same way as any other social situation.  That said, I have to admit that I wouldn't have tried going to a unisex sauna in my early teen years when the whole erection thing was a bit less controlled."
Finland,36jnwu,wiztard,6,Tue May 19 22:19:51 2015 UTC,Never been a issue. Especially when drunk at the cabin. And Finnish midsummer is 90% naked even without the sauna.
Finland,36jnwu,raskas_kylkimiina,4,Wed May 20 09:05:52 2015 UTC,"Being naked in sauna is for most Finnish people an entirely non-sexual situation. It's not usual that someone gets an unwanted erection. It's never happened to me and I haven't seen it happen to anyone else.   By the way, unisex saunas aren't all that common (they do exist, but more often than not, men and women have their own turns)."
Finland,36jnwu,corvid_,6,Wed May 20 12:04:15 2015 UTC,Being in a sauna is the opposite of making a speech. Don't imagine everyone naked.
Finland,36jnwu,Biiviz,3,Wed May 20 12:25:44 2015 UTC,Well in some cases (partying and mixed saunas) it might of course happen but even that needs some sexual tension beforehand. In normal situations I haven't seen anyone getting a boner in sauna unless it has been well uhm needed.

Finland,36jdov,newinfinland,2,Tue May 19 20:38:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure how the law works, but I would assume a part-time secondary job is fine. You can get an additional tax card from the tax authorities for your secondary employer and income from that job is treated as secondary income, whatever that means. Your original tax card has to be given to your primary employer. Below is a link to the relevant site on Vero.fi:  http://www.vero.fi/en-US/Individuals/Tax_Cards/Working_for_more_than_one_employer%2832338%29  Edit: and by law I mean the law that says how many hours you're allowed to work per week, total, over many jobs. Työaikalaki/Working hours law doesn't seem to mention having multiple jobs, just says something like at most average of 40 hours per week over some period. But I'm not a lawyer so don't count on this information."
Finland,36jdov,kookosbanaani,2,Tue May 19 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"There shouldn't be any problems exceeding the full time hours, as you'll be under a different employer on a different contract. A lot of people have secondary jobs alongside their full-time job - weekend or evening jobs as a bouncer or a taxi driver, for example.   For the easiest way to handle taxation, you can use the secondary tax card for income tax from the secondary job. The downside is that the percentage deducted from the gross salary will be high - over 40% most likely. You'll get back any excess tax you've paid though, after the tax bureau has calculated how much you really should have paid.   If you know exactly how much you will earn, you can give the tax bureau a call, and they'll likely be able to give you a tax card that takes into account both jobs, and won't have as high of a percentage as the secondary tax card."
Finland,36jdov,Nefera,2,Wed May 20 03:03:54 2015 UTC,"1) 37,5 hours has nothing to do with taxation (or with the law, either)  2) Give your tax card to second employee.

One day, my grandma decided we should visit her sister, who lived couple of kilometres away from her. It was middle of winter. My grandma wrapped me up and set me down on the potkukelkka and away we went. Now here's the scary part. Right next to my grandparents house, is an old house from early 1800's in which my grandpa was born in. It stayed empty during winter and only had people in during summer, when my grandpa's brother's widow came to spend her summer there. This old building had three windows facing our side of the land. When we passed the building, I saw a young blond girl, wearing a plaid shirt and apron, pulling the curtains apart and looking at us. I thought she looked pretty and asked grandma, who the girl was. Grandma got angry at me and shouted there's no one in there. I got very upset from that yelling as I felt it wasn't fair as it wasn't my fault she was standing there. 3-year old logic :D   Now fast forward to around 2010. The widow passed away and her children came over to sort out the estate. They were kind enough to let my grandparents and my aunts and uncles to go and get any furniture from there they'd like to have as memento. My grandparents picked this huge black and red commode that incidentally used to be in the room I saw the girl in. Not two weeks later, cousin of mine was staying at grandparents for the weekend with her parents. When they woke up the next morning, my cousin (she was around 8 at the time) asked, who was the blond girl walking around here at night?"

Finland,36ee2k,Kyesah,2,Mon May 18 20:14:36 2015 UTC,Is your grandma still alive? Maybe there's a reason she got that mad at you.  Or you could try to ask from your relatives if a girl  that age has lived in the house or what kind of history that piece of furniture has.
Finland,36ee2k,ThriftyFinn,3,Mon May 18 20:22:31 2015 UTC,Grandma is still alive but suffers from early onset of dementia. I could ask grandpa next time I see him as it was his home as a kid. Thanks for the tip!

Finland,36ee2k,ThriftyFinn,2,Mon May 18 20:12:55 2015 UTC,The girl seemed solid to me. Especially with the touching and moving the curtains. Maybe it was an apparition? There are so many different kind of terms for these things.

Only thing that should ever be praised is God's infinite grace, nothing more, nothing less.  That being said, I am an atheist as is the majority of us Finns, so yeah, other countries can go suck it. As geographical locations with an abundance of people and capital, there are achievements in which individuals with your respective nationalities have excelled. As countries?

Pros:   The people are hard-working and generally care about their neighbours, environment, and whatnot. The living standards are considerably higher in Finland for the poorest. A great sense of egalitarianism. Everything just works. This may or may not make much sense to someone who's lived in the UK/France/Spain their whole life, but let's just say that to a Finn things generally ""don't work"" in the rest of the world apart from Sweden, Japan, and Germany. Nobody in Finland has problems with things like household heating, petty crime, littering, getting their post lost, etc. When I came to the UK, I thought trash lying around and yobs loitering about was something you only saw in former Soviet countries. This only applies really if you're not from the more affluent areas of the south of England. The kebab is on average miles better than in the UK.   Cons:  -It's dark.  -All the cons relating to being a small country. This means we're always half a decade behind on many things,  especially culture and food.  -It can get quite boring because of the above reasons.  -It's expensive to fly anywhere abroad, even on discount airlines. Even living in Latvia would provide you with much more affordable access to destinations in Europe/Asia/Africa by air."

Everyone speaks usable English.  People around the capital and largest university cities are the most international. East houses more talkative and neighborly (karelians even stalk a bit) people. West more stoic and entrepreneurial. Northerners are a bit isolated, resourceful and accustomed to travelling. Southeners are fast-paced, don't really talk to strangers in public, more trendy (hip/green) and work-oriented. They are also a bit of a mix of others because of migration towards the capital.  I suggest at least a university town. It will provide smoother ride than full on Finnish experience. Jobs in English also tend to be available only in these towns."

Are there any younger people that speak Finnish or any places that teach Finnish? Also don't you have world or European history to teach about the pohjasota or jatkosota?
Finland,36238v,tehzeroFIN,1 point,Fri May 15 19:08:53 2015 UTC,"Finn here, never heard of pohjasota. Google tells me it was a rather obscure war in 17th century including factions I've never even heard of, like Holstein-Gottorp, Valachia and Old Saxony. Just curious, why mention this pohjasota instead of nuijasota, Oolannin sota, sisällissota, talvisota, Lapin sota or Isoviha that are all a lot more known?"

Finland,36238v,Nirriti_the_Black,2,Tue May 19 14:03:13 2015 UTC,Because of the global importance. Winter War was regional.  The Great Northern War was between 3 great powers and their allies on each side. Isoviha (time of Finland's area being occupied by Russians in that war) did huge damage to us. 8 years of hostile occupation vs. 3-4 months of Winter War. http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoviha

For eating out you pretty much have to travel to Helsinki. You can save money by buying a 30-day travel card, which for non-resident costs 155 euros for a month. You can buy one at the R-Kioski at the airport and you can travel all over Helsinki Region with it. If you want to buy individual tickets, they cost 5 euros one way. Within Espoo 3 euros."

Finland,361r95,simputer,19,Fri May 15 11:04:27 2015 UTC,"I think that it says ""kiekon kääntö"". So basically they are claiming thar you showed up, parked and your parking time ended, then you came back and moved the dial to the new time and continued to park your car there"
Finland,361r95,katenastia,10,Fri May 15 11:16:09 2015 UTC,Damn.. So this is illegal? I did park my car and changed the timer again before it expired. I thought that's the general practice.
Finland,361r95,TheFantasticFinn,30,Fri May 15 11:36:39 2015 UTC,"It's illegal.   What you can do to bypass this in a legal way is to drive around the parking lot and then take the same spot.   From what I've understood, parking wardens monitor this thing by looking at the wheel's valve. So essentially, they take a picture of your valve and the position it's in and then later they see if it has moved or not. If you re-enter a parking space like I mentioned earlier, there is basically a 0% chance of your wheel being tilted in the same angle again.  That's what I was taught in driving school anyway."
Finland,361r95,katenastia,11,Fri May 15 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"yeah its illegal, but most of the parking wardens generally can't bother with monitoring it. And yes, it is the general practice, since no one is bothered to give a crap about it"
Finland,361r95,Harriv,4,Fri May 15 11:45:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, here's the legal text: http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1990/19900924#Pidp256032  Relevant part is in 2§:    Merkittyä saapumisaikaa ei saa pysäköintikiekon käyttövelvollisuuden voimassaoloaikana muuttaa.   Which is something like   Arrival time must not be changed during the obligation to use of the parking disc."
Finland,361r95,tiikerikani,4,Fri May 15 20:12:28 2015 UTC,"Just checking - are you setting the clock to the time you parked there like you're supposed to, not the ""end"" of your parking time?"
Finland,361r95,Elukka,2,Fri May 15 11:18:44 2015 UTC,"yes, the time was set correctly."
Finland,361r95,0_0_0,3,Fri May 15 11:37:00 2015 UTC,"What was that dial set to? The picture is a bit blurry but, if the arrow is pointing at ""10:40"", then that's one reason you might have gotten the ticket. You're only supposed to set the dial to even hours and half hours. I recall a Finnish court recently setting a precedent that this rule really does matter and you get an automatic ticket if you set the arrow incorrectly somewhere between the black lines."
Finland,361r95,henkraks,2,Fri May 15 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"10:30. good that you bring that up, I can use some clarification. If time is 10:35 or 10:40 do I set the clock to 11:00 or 10:30?"
Finland,361r95,TheFantasticFinn,3,Sat May 16 09:21:01 2015 UTC,The next following full or half hour.  Never backwards.
Finland,361r95,henkraks,5,Sat May 16 11:48:06 2015 UTC,Private parking monitoring does not enjoy the same legal status as municipal monitoring. There are ways you can contest the ticket and practically always win.
Finland,361r95,TheFantasticFinn,2,Fri May 15 13:10:18 2015 UTC,Care to expand on these methods?
Finland,361r95,henkraks,3,Fri May 15 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"These private parking lots usually have a sign claiming by parking you agree to the terms. The primary user marked in the vehicle register is the person that will be billed.  Unless the parking company is capable of proving that the person who agreed to the agreement by parking the vehicle is also the person they are requiring to pay the fine are the same person they can't require you to pay the bill. Sure, slightly a scumbag move, but the industry is missing regulation and it's been bumping up and down in the courts and parliament.  tl;dr You can't be required to pay something you didn't agree to in the first place."
Finland,361r95,TheFantasticFinn,2,Fri May 15 14:46:40 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Thanks for sharing that.  If this was to happen me, what should I do to contest the ticket and is this ""law"" officially available somewhere online?"
Finland,361r95,Ekaros,3,Fri May 15 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"Simply don't pay and if they come asking just reply with not knowing who had the car and that you're not a party of said agreement.  This said, laws do tend to change and the Supreme Court recently a few years back said that the agreement is binding. But in this case the person did admit to parking his car."

Finland,361r95,TheFantasticFinn,2,Fri May 15 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"Correct way to work with these tickets if you want to avoid paying, is to inform that you didn't park the car nor know who did. And this is only after you get notice from mail. Usually they don't follow up on these.  I'm not legal expert and haven't done it myself, but this is my understanding of how things can be done."
Finland,361r95,Ekaros,2,Fri May 15 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"You can just throw it in the trash, if you get shit for it say that you couldnt make out what it said."
Finland,361r95,OWKuusinen,2,Fri May 15 14:03:40 2015 UTC,"Would that actually hold up in court?  To me I took the course about law in highschool so I'm an expert, right? it doesn't sound like a reasonable reason not to pay a fine."
Finland,361r95,TheFantasticFinn,2,Fri May 15 14:56:18 2015 UTC,"No, saying you saw it is wrong way, better to tell that you have no idea who parked the car. The contract is against person who parked the car and as it's private company they can't really force you to tell. Point is that then they would need to pursue it in court and really can't prove the person easily, so usually they don't."

The biggest event in Helsinki is probably the city's official new year's party on Senate square. Usually there's some performances, music and a big firework show.   You can buy tickets to night clubs only if there's some kind of show during the night. Otherwise you just wait in line and pay the entrance fee at the door. I recommend going early if you don't want to wait in a line for ages in the cold. (And I mean, it can be anything from +5 to -30 degrees) However, you can book a table or other seats for some clubs, but since it's popular party night, you need to do that early."

I haven't actually seen a rye beer in here, that'd be a good choice for something a bit different.  I might actually have to devote the rest of the week to try and find some for me too, that sounds delicious."

I bring back a bottle every time I go back to the states. There's only one kind of tequila sold in Alko in Finland and it's ABSOLUTE SHIT.

No, really - I discuss Eurovision with someone more or less every day and currently have numerous friends in Vienna (alas, I couldn't make it). My favourite is Estonia. Won't go into much more detail about my ranking, but Australia is in my top ten. Let them participate - they're ESC-crazy like no other (okay, maybe the Maltese) with millions of fans who can now see their country compete. I've got a personal wishlist of other non-EBU area countries I'd like to see...  I'm not throwing a viewing party, but got asked to one. Was skeptical last year going to my first one as some people do not care (yet know everything about how bad the contest is and can/will give you a detailed lecture) and I follow it religiously, but it worked out fine so I'm going this year as well.  Only ten days left!"

Finland,35uuk2,Oskuri,1 point,Thu May 14 08:58:34 2015 UTC,"While the EBU have said this is a one-off unless Australia win (and they may very well do so) I think it's not that clear-cut and that if they do return they'll be sent to the semis then. For a (for now) one-off, it's good to have them in the final - they won't run the risk of missing out on their one chance and won't be taking a spot from an EBU member."

Not too keen on the fact that Australia is participating though but Eurovision stopped being just Europe ages ago so meh.  On a side note - I based my East Asian politics final exam in Uni on my theory that if they started an East Asian song contest it would ease tensions between the countries...

Savonlinna is a summer town deep in lake-country and is the home port of many smaller cruise ships. In addition to visiting the castle, I'd recommend hopping on a tour boat.

Finland,35ozh7,ArttuH5N1,8,Tue May 12 18:58:33 2015 UTC,"The following two primary sources (non-mirrored) represent the range (min./max.) of total area for China and the United States. Both sources exclude Taiwan from the area of China.  The Encyclopædia Britannica lists China as world's third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with a total area of 9,572,900 sq km,[4] and the U.S. as fourth-largest at 9,526,468 sq km. The figure for the U.S. is less than in the CIA Factbook because it excludes Coastal and Territorial waters.[5]  The CIA World Factbook lists the United States as the third-largest country (after Russia and Canada) with total area of 9,826,675 sq km,[6] and China as fourth-largest at 9,596,961 sq km.[7] This figure for the U.S. is greater than in the Encyclopædia Britannica because it includes Coastal and Territorial waters.  Disputed Ranking Explanation: The dispute for world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of Coastal and Territorial waters for United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA World Factbook and its previous iterations[8] against the information for United States on Encyclopaedia Britannica, particularly its footnote section.[5] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA World Factbook (from 1982 to 1996), the US was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 sq km. However, in the 1997 edition, the US added Coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 sq km). And then again in 2007, US added Territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,826,630 sq km). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. In other words, no Coastal or Territorial water space was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a Coastal water area of 109,362 sq km, and a Territorial water area of 195,213 sq km, for a total of 304,575 sq km of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the US will boost it over China in ranking since China's Coastal and Territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.

Finland,35ozh7,kisu999,10,Tue May 12 19:51:10 2015 UTC,"I love reading these, because they sum up complicated geopolitical situations surprisingly well.  For example: "" During World War II, it successfully defended its independence through cooperation with Germany and resisted subsequent invasions by the Soviet Union""  Yes, many people think we kept our independence because of a defensive victory in The Winter War, but Germany wasn't really a part of that. I don't know if CIA knows about some secret wars, but ""subsequent invasions""?? After the Winter War we had the Continuation war, not wars, and I think it's safe to say it wasn't an invasion by The Soviet Union. It was us attacking them, and them (somewhat understandably) attacking back."

This isn't going to look good as it contrasts with my username, but I understood that Russians attacked before they knew we had crossed the border?

Finland,35ozh7,OWKuusinen,3,Tue May 12 22:49:04 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the Continuation War was inevitable because of Germany. Germany was going to invade Soviet Union, so reclaiming the lost territory and pushing the defensive lines further away was strategic and political decision.  Of course Soviet Union did the same thing during the Winter War, hoping to get a buffer zone in front of vital areas such as St. Petersburg."

Finland,35ozh7,hulibuli,2,Tue May 12 17:26:43 2015 UTC,I thought that the real war started when Soviets bombed Finnish cities and towns after which we declared war and attacked.

Finland,35ozh7,sosern,3,Tue May 12 17:24:26 2015 UTC,In Continuation War Germany had already invaded Soviet Union. Finland waited couple of days for Soviets to bomb in retaliation as we let Germans pass through us and then we declared official war.

Nick Borgen recorded the song with the players, and released it as a promo single.  The song las later become popular as played when the home team scores.   The words Den glider in origin from a famous report by Swedish radio reporter Lennart Hyland when Nils Nilsson scored the final goal in open goal when Sweden won, 5-3, against Canada before winning the entire tournament during the 1962 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship in Colorado, US.   The song also became a Svensktoppen hit, charting between 29 April-6 May 1995, with a first position followed up with a third position.

He's almost done with his degree, but he had a look at the new schedule, and he said it looks very interesting, and the lesson names sounded very practical.  But don't just take my word for it. You could try emailing Metropolia and ask them yourself. See if you can persuade them to give you the contact information of someone who is responsible for the curriculum planning."
Finland,35fahi,TheSodesa,1 point,Sun May 10 18:40:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help :) I'll ask them. Are UASes really difficult to get into relative to decent universities in UK/US
Finland,35fahi,Onicle,2,Sun May 10 18:51:13 2015 UTC,"UAS graduates have a degree, that is somewhat equivalent to a bachelor's. Studying at a UAS is generally more practical, almost vocational school-like, when compared to an ""actual"" university. If that sounds good, then go for it.  I don't know how the entrance exams are for foreigners, but at least Finnish natives have to answer one math question (usually involves solving a group of equations), one logic related question and either a physics or a chemistry question. Even with shitty math skills you should be able to get in, but you'll be taking more math courses once you're in if your results were bad.  At least that's how it was for me before I dropped out due to a nervous breakdown (non-school related)."
Finland,35fahi,Aerrae,1 point,Sun May 10 19:05:50 2015 UTC,"just prepare for the exam, you should be able to find out older admission exams somewhere and see how your level is compared to the exam. The study in UAS might be quite demanding in the beginning but it all depends on a study focus and/or the school which you are in. I have UAS degree from Mech. Eng."
Finland,35fahi,teel,1 point,Tue May 12 14:11:45 2015 UTC,Yes.  EDIT: Just make sure your program includes a lot of courses in game development rather than just generic IT courses.
Finland,35fahi,klasu-m,4,Sun May 10 11:59:48 2015 UTC,This might interest you
Finland,35fahi,Straiffi,3,Sun May 10 13:25:40 2015 UTC,"Also heard that its more ""practical"" compared to regular university programs. I'm not sure what that means for someone who will be spending most of their time crunching codes and designing graphics and animations :\   For example, university CS programme might include more (or higher level) math, maybe physics (in universities of technology) and in general, a more emphasis on ""theoretical computer science"" kind of courses (think about academic research). They might be more prestigious, but I don't know how much it's about the quality of teaching and level of studies, and how much the school being called a university. I think they might be more difficult to get into than UAS'es (at least  institutions like Aalto), so there's that.  I have no first hand knowledge about UAS programmes (so take this and all of the above with a grain of salt), but I think there might be more emphasis on practical coding, and so on. A gamedev oriented UAS programme probably isn't a bad choice if you really want to just to do gamedev."
Finland,35fahi,Straiffi,3,Sun May 10 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'm holding an IT degree from an UAS. A generic one, not game development-specific.  I'll argue it's better to get just a generic IT degree, since all the same software development principles apply to game development as well, and you may have to temporarily get some web-developer job in case your game development ventures don't pan out immediately.  I'm actively developing games, on my own and sometimes as part of my job, and the generic UAS IT-degree was more than adequate for this. I did have to study the game-specific stuff on my own time but that wasn't really too much of a problem. I never felt like I needed to take school courses for them."

Finland,35dzdt,learninggroot,9,Sat May 9 12:13:55 2015 UTC,You are too late in applying to schools for next academic year. There are courses starting in January and the application deadline for those is sometime in September-October if I remember correctly. In general the application date for undergraduate courses is in February/March and for postgraduate March/April. The entrance exams are in May/June and you will be notified by end of July if you get in.
Finland,35dzdt,ThriftyFinn,6,Sat May 9 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"This applies to bachelor's degrees, but some master's programs have separate, even continuous, applying periods."
Finland,35dzdt,elmokki,8,Sat May 9 13:09:39 2015 UTC,"Just to iron out some cultural misunderstandings in some of the replies.  The education is completely free for all, regardless of country of origin. As you are both citizens of EU countries, you don't need to worry about visas either. ( The fact that you consider yourself an Australian and live there makes no difference as long as you have an EU passport.)  When Finns say ""studying is not completely free"", they mean that you will still have to pay for your housing and food yourself. (Yes, that's how pampered we are.) There are no course or enrollment fees. There may be a 100-200 euro mandatory student association fee to pay every year, but that of course is nothing compared to university fees in Australia.  There are very few 'campus' like student houses. Mostly student accommodation is owned by a student housing association, which provides housing for all students, in different institutions, in the city. You can apply as a couple and get a flat for just the two of you. The queues can be long and it may be a few months of airbnb or similar before you get the place after your studies have started.  This website might have useful info on applying etc.:https://studyinfo.fi/wp2/en/ ."
Finland,35dzdt,steveholtismymother,8,Sat May 9 13:39:58 2015 UTC,"Forgot to add that the value of your degree in Australia depends on Australian system and attitudes and in the field of your study. I've had no problems, or need to explain, my qualifications from Finnish institutions in other EU countries, but it all depends on whether in Australia employers are suspicious of foreign degrees, or whether the fact that it's Finland, the wonder country of education, is actually a bonus. If there's a r/jobsaustralia or something, you might want to ask around there.   The biggest shock, I expect, will be the dark. It's bloody dark in the winter and it will get to you. And if you're thinking ""pfft, it gets dark in the winter everywhere"", let me repeat: it's bloody dark, and it will get to you. :) Good luck!"
Finland,35dzdt,steveholtismymother,5,Sat May 9 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"You'll get a Diploma Supplement with your degree paper if you ask. That's available in every country that's participating in the Bologna Process. With the supplement comparing the content between these countries becomes trivial. It includes a description of the nature, level, context, content and status of the studies completed by the person in question."
Finland,35dzdt,juhamac,1 point,Sat May 9 17:01:50 2015 UTC,The education is completely free for all   Just to point out you have to pay roughly 100€ + student card (~30€) per year to the university.
Finland,35dzdt,Onicle,4,Tue May 12 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"1) Looking from you and your girlfriends perspectives respectively, yes, compared to most other countries our university education is practically free of charge. If you have the money to cover your living expenses there shouldn't be any problems that you can't overcome.  2) As far as I know, as long as you're an EU citizen there shouldn't be a problem in that regard, your Italian girlfriend is actually slightly better off because of already having permanent residence in the Schengen area. Basically she doesn't even require a passport to travel to Finland, but it's good to have an id with you at least most of the time, especially if you're visiting any public office or even in the case if you want a library card.  3) Process of being accepted into a university course? This I'm not too sure since it's been some time since I've had to think about this, but I think the first thing that you need to do is to contact the university's office and ask them what it takes for you to get to study in that specific university.  4) Campus accommodation is available for exchange students, or all degree students in general. Depending on which university you're enrolling though, there might be a considerable queue before you. Apply for student housing on time, which is basically as soon as you have the official documentation that you're eligible to study in the university of your choice. Have a backup plan available in case you have to wait student housing for several weeks (it can happen).  5) Cost of living in Finland is ridiculous. Incidentally a restaurant meal in Sydney can be about 8 $AUS, in Finland a similar meal is 8€, so currently that would make Finland about 1.4 times more expensive (if I counted that right...). Bonuses on being a student is that the student housing can be a lot cheaper, and if you have a student card or other valid documentation of being a degree student, then you are eligible for student discounts in the university restaurants/cafeterias.  6) Degrees most likely do have enough relevance, but they might possibly require you to have supplemental courses from an Australian university in order to work in a relatively strictly regulated discipline like psychology. That being said, a degree from a Finnish university does give you at least the basic requirements to have the qualifications in the field of your choosing, I do know at least one neuropsychologist graduated from a Finnish university and working in that field in UK."
Finland,35dzdt,keepfrgettngmypsswrd,3,Sat May 9 12:47:26 2015 UTC,"Small addition to 5)  Student meals are great. When you get a blue student card from Kela the state pays 1,94 euros for the service provider for each meal. So for example at the University of Eastern Finland you'd pay at the moment only 2,15 euros per lunch.  700-800 euros per month is comfortable burn rate. With two persons probably 600 each could suffice. It's possible to work part time during study periods and full time outside with the student visa. It can be a bit hard to get a part-time job, because many employers require Finnish. But it's unlikely that you'd live for free even back in Australia.  You can search with Google yourself how Australian job market accepts certain EU-degrees. There's surely dozens of  case studies already for each."
Finland,35dzdt,juhamac,2,Sat May 9 16:55:34 2015 UTC,http://studyinfinland.fi/  Your biggest problem is probably language. English programs are limited.
Finland,35dzdt,Harriv,2,Sat May 9 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"I can help with #3.  While the individual universities set the program-specific requirements, there's a central application agency that processes applicants for the most basic requirements (https://uaf.it.helsinki.fi/funima/).  You may run into some issues with proving your English skills, depending on what credentials you already have officially.  (For instance, the agency didn't like that I had completed much of my degree online, and wanted supplemental info to prove that I, a Canadian, could speak English.)  Deadlines to apply are often several months ahead of when locals would have to apply.  My GPA mattered in that I needed to exceed a minimum designated by my program, but I didn't need to do any additional exams.  The application process, between the central agency and the individual universities, is actually very intuitive and clear.  Check out the websites for specifics on deadlines and requirements."
Finland,35dzdt,Magicksmith,1 point,Sat May 9 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"Native Finns get free ~500€/month for studying. You can barely get by with it at least if you don't live in Helsinki. That's very much barely, however.   Finding work may be challenging even for a person who speaks fluent Finnish, but depending on your skill set you might be able to get something. Don't hold your breath though.  Should you time your application for student housing early enough (like, April or May, June at latest. To a lesser extent December or January might be okay as well) you should have a fairly good chance to get cheap housing as long as you qualify. A small studio is probably out of question though.   Do note that bachelor's degrees in Finland are seldom completely in English. It really limits your choices. For master's degrees there are more options."
Finland,35dzdt,elmokki,1 point,Sat May 9 12:56:12 2015 UTC,"Is all uni education in your country free/super cheap or are there only a select few schools which offer this?   Remember that we're a small country so there pretty much are a select few universities in general.   Do the degrees have any relevance in Australia? If we both graduated with a degree in psychology for example, would we be able to take that back to Australia and find work asap?   That would kind of depend of the degree. I know my CS degree would be highly relevant pretty much everywhere because there are no formal requirements for computer scientists. YMMV with regard to psychology.  Speaking of psychology be aware that gaining entrance to a degree program in psychology may be difficult. Because of the free tuition there are always way more applicants than there are slots. Last year pass rates for the entrance exams ranged from 9,4% to 4,1% of those who attended the entrance exam.  Also I don't think they teach the basic courses in English. The rule of thumb is mostly that bachelor-level courses are taught in Finnish and master's level courses are or can be taught in English."

They've straight out told corporations to make this and that kind of funding application, and the project will be guaranteed hundreds of thousands if not millions of euros - in 100 % support funding (? tuki), not a penny of loan. Seeing as they don't get (win) anything from support funding, it's really baffling how this is still allowed.

It's a lot easier to be in the opposition and raise critique than actually taking responsibility of decision making. A party that has their foundation in ""disappointed and angry"" might only work from the opposition and once they face the hard decisions, I wouldn't be too surprised if their support will take a nose dive in 4 years due to loosing the angry and disappointed voters. They will remain angry and disappoint in any case, since most of their angst is not founded in any actual reality, only moaning at the work place cafeteria."

Minority should finally accept their place among other minorities.   And this is completely unrelated. RKP has been in the government precisely because they aren't hard-lining the big decisions but instead agree on compromises and the will of the major parities. That makes them part of the majority, not the minority.   And even if they are language-wise a minority, why the fuck should they ""accept their place among the minority"".

Do you seriously think RKP has been in the government for so long because of some favoritism or ""higher priority"". It is a liberal party with a focus on minorities and a healthy defense and economy. Because it doesn't bind its MP:s to vote in a certain way, it is flexible and compromising and it's easy to join any government. RKP isn't just a language party you know. Jufo was in RKP for example, and I don't think he could care less about swedish in schools.   You honestly dont see anything wrong with mandatory swedish and the bullshit related to that problem?   Yes there are problems although I bet I see it differently than you. But that still has nothing to do with this discussion or RKP in the government."

They are okay with this. I dont see any proof of them ever working towards creating equality and lessening the potential for ethnic conflicts. Major RKP figures have for example stated that the force behind the campaign against mandatory swedish is ""swedophobia"". Even ""russian agitators"" have been speculated.  In any case, wide polls from different gallups have shown that a clear majority of finns are against mandatory swedish. Its insulting and distasteful for RKP to state that all these people are swedophobes when most of them obviously dont have anything against swedes, fennoswedes or swedish language itself (as shown by the polls too).   Could it be that the strategy of RKP regarding this matter is provocation, straight out lies and defamation, rather than facts and logic?  Swedish language doesnt have a special privilege to be mandatory. For people to be equal in this situation youd also have to make other significant minority languages mandatory ""just in case"".  This was released after the anti-mandatory swedish initiative was trashed.   How in the fucking world do you think that this is a good idea? To push mandatory swedish agenda further after its very clear that majority of finns oppose it.  Mandatory swedish isnt the thing that makes us western. It isnt our ""only tie to the nordic countries"".  Its not something that will be beneficial. The fact we were subordinates to sweden for 700 years doesnt mean we have to learn it. If you are one of the people who believe that you should give yourself a moment without your raging fanaticism and think about it again."

Negative: Perussuomalaiset in the government. It's a populist party that hasn't had any real solutions to anything, ever (although I agree that borrowing throwing away money to Greece was a bad move).   They get voters by gross ad hominem attacks. They rally ignorant people against people instead of ideas based on often usually wrong facts that almost without fail are completely irrelevant to the argument in question, as evidenced by the anti-RKP loudmouths on this sub that couldn't find the words correlation and reason if they were written on a brick and stuck up their flaccid arseholes.  I am really afraid how this goes when we have a government party that is driven by bigotry and hate.  The Center party is nearly as bad as the christian democrats. Sipilä is a devout laestadian. Soini believes a cracker turns into the flesh of a dead god when you eat it. However, this government doesn't have to make as many compromises as the last one and maybe - just maybe - they can make the hard decisions, if they can distinguish them from the delusions of the true finns.  Edit: And the hard decision they should do first: Fire 10% of evira,valvira and trafi every time they show they have too much time on their hands, such as legislating drones, complaining about beer blogs, even researching an idea as gormless as GPS trackers on cars and so on. Raising taxes to get yourself out of debt is like lifting yourself up by your own hair. Cuts must start with the bloated byrocratic government."
