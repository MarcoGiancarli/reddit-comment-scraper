memes,3dxg8w,saigonsurvival,11,Mon Jul 20 09:49:06 2015 UTC,I cant stand soccer or basketball for this reason. People always tell me Its just a part of the game. Acting like you're hurt to gain a penalty flag or anything else like it against the opposing team is cheating. Flopping on the ground when you barely got nudged in a game of basketball is cheating. If you are caught cheating or attempting to cheat in professional sports there should be large punishments attached to it.
memes,3dxg8w,Otumscray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"They do get punished in football if they dive though? There are some who are known for it, and there are some tough cookies. It can happen anywhere in any sport, it's only most known through these sports."
memes,3dxg8w,Nuclearbananas,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yes they do have penalties and fines but obviously not severe enough to prevent it from happening. Flopping is not only blatant cheating but its an insult to the officials of the game and worse more so than anything the fans of the sport. The fines should be very heavily stacked against anyone caught in the act of pretending to be injured or flopping on the ground. I get that basket ball is a ""non-contact"" sport. But to be slightly nudged or brushed up against by another player does not warrant you to throw yourself to the ground and splay out obscenely for the refs to see and blow the whistle. It goes against the spirit of the rules and frankly is completely void of anything related to athleticism."
memes,3dxg8w,Otumscray,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:37 2015 UTC,Not in all cases but a lot players do this to avoid injury. It's a lot safer to let you body just fall instead of trying to catch yourself mid-trip etc. and risk injury.   I do agree with you in terms of players milking for penalties though.
memes,3dxg8w,STEEZ_AB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:42:51 2015 UTC,I totally get the spirit of your argument. But being tripped is a legitimate call. I am not trying to say that accidents dont happen or people loose their sense of balance or accidentally whack a guy in the arm trying to block the ball. Things happen of course. My problem is when a player brushes against another player or even slightly bumps into him. I love hockey and they do A LOT to keep players from faking penalties. They pretty much shame them publicly and dock their pay. They replay the incident again and again making a fool out of the player. It happens but not very often. Most other sports seem to have just gone completely off the rails with penalties these days.

Bad sportsmanship would be if the athlete mouthed off at another player or official. But altering the outcome of the game based on something that didnt really happen would be like hiding an extra card under your sleeve in a game of poker. Cheating as far as I can tell.

memes,3dn4rw,prillin101,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"Why do so few people ever seem to ask themselves why developing countries standard of living is so far behind the West. The short and simple answer is culture. We in the west have something few in the developing world seem to possess and that is trust. We can trust if we make a deposit in a bank it will still be there tomorrow. We can trust if we do a days work we will be paid for that service, we can trust if we go to the police for help they will not kidnap us and hold us for ransom. If there is an injustice we can trust in the justice system to correct it. There are always exceptions but by in large our system works because most people are honest and we have an established culture of trust. The same cannot be said in much of the developing world.   We have laid the blueprint to a functional high standard of living society. The rest of the world just needs to follow suit. There is obviously more to it than just trust but trust, I would wager, is one of the single biggest factor to a better standard of living. When we invite in large groups from the 3rd world and don't ask them to adapt it drags our quality of life down to their level. When I was a kid most people I knew didn't lock their doors at night and burglaries were exceptionally rare, now that is almost unheard of. I'm all for helping the developing world improve it's standard of living but I think if you don't address the root cause (lack of trust and honesty) the developing world will never improve to our level. Foreign aid money would be better spent on free schools in the developing world to teach the importance of being honorable and educate people on entrepreneurship as well micro loans and support to help people start their own businesses. There was a good Ted talk proving how immigration from the developing world will never fix the problem and just drag us down in the process due to the shear number of people involved."

In the Civil War any immigrant male looking to become an American citizen was forced to fight for the North just so they could live here. Most of those families never saw they're father's, brothers and son's again. Also America was a new undeveloped Nation where the people came here and helped build it from the ground up. Now if your coming to America your only causing more stress on everyone else looking for jobs."

The literature suggests otherwise, from /u/commentsrus:  On open borders specifically, I have several papers: This one is the most frequently cited.  http://www.cgdev.org/publication/labor-mobility-agenda-development-working-paper-201  http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jkennan/research/OpenBorders.pdf  Finally, there's a whole website with more general articles on open borders.  If you want articles on the welfare effects of immigrants on natives, I have even more papers.    I think you're just a stupid xenophobe that has done no research"

White boy wants 20/hr to pick oranges, but Pablo over here does it for 20 bucks a day. Smh. Why do they let us treat them like shit?! It's costing us Americans jobs."

memes,3dn4rw,prillin101,0,Sun Jul 19 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Lots of hypocrisy comments below. America is defined by its freedom to emigrate to, people in the 19th century went to America to escape famine, persecution and discrimination. You can't deny that service to people today, who are suffering the same problems, just because of a few bad eggs. Like it or not, America is a country of immigrants and, if the American constitution is something to go by, should remain so."
memes,3dn4rw,Alexander_Baidtach,0,Sat Jul 18 01:27:31 2015 UTC,You seem to miss the part about the social services that are being abused by a large percentage of illegal immigrants. I honestly have no problem with a sensible immigration policy but illegal immigrants are a big problem. At the start of the 19th century there were no social services to take advantage of. You found work and contributed or you starved. The county was still not fully developed and needed people to work and build the country; that is no longer the case except for big agribusiness who want cheap labour. If you were to allow everyone who wanted to immigrate to the US in we wold be deluged by billions and the US would cease to be a high standard of living country. The answer is not immigration but helping developing countries improve their standard of living through education.
