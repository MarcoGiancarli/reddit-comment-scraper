duluth,3dxe0y,BarackSays,9,Mon Jul 20 09:16:46 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard about the person living there, Mcdonalds wanted to buy his/her land to build a parking lot, he/she refused. So Mcdonalds put up that fence and the drive thru speakers face his/her house and they are open 24 hours. The signs are a form of protest. This is just what I heard from my old boss, but it sounds plausible.  Now if you really want to see crazy...take a drive up highway 53. Up near Cotton, there is a man with a giant sign/billboard which he changes every so often, talking about the evil america and lots of crazy ranting. One of my co-workers has actually met this guy and he is just a big bag of crazy and he threatens the post office all the time with a gun, saying they better stay off his property."
duluth,3dxe0y,vincentkahrune,3,Mon Jul 20 12:54:41 2015 UTC,You're correct. They were in protest to the removal of trees and the additional light pollution the residence receives. McDonalds did plant new trees that will eventually supplant the old ones.
duluth,3dxe0y,aluminumpork,4,Mon Jul 20 13:43:17 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I remember. Total dick move by McDonalds, but it was funny that the owner actually retaliated by getting brighter lights and moving the speakers to face the residence.  There's a lesson here. Don't buy a house right next to McDonalds if you don't want to live right next to Mcdonalds."

duluth,3cpyoj,DynamiteDevil,4,Fri Jul 10 00:26:00 2015 UTC,If you're someone who likes the outdoors I could give you a few suggestions. Ely's peak on the backside of spirit noutain is really great hike and jay Cooke just a lil further is awesome if you like climbing on rocks near the rapids. If you're feeling even more adventurous spirit mountain has down hill biking trails with a ski lift to bring you to the top as well as lil rides like a zip line.

They also do scenic train rides which are really fun. Otherwise there is the zoo and the fresh water aquarium. There is also a ton of hiking and several miles of board walk. You can also check at the maritime museum by the bridge every day to see when the big ships are coming through. The musuem is also really neat and free. Most of the restaurants downtown or in canal park are pretty pricy, but some are pretty good. There was a thread on here awhile back on people upvoting their favorites in Duluth.  It is right.

Enger Tower has a great view of Duluth, and Grand Marais is a semi-long drive (~2hrs) up the north shore, and has some really picturesque harbor settings if you'd like to make an album documenting your travels."
duluth,3cmwa3,PM_ME_UR_COOTER,3,Thu Jul 9 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"If you can get a reservation, Split Rock Lighthouse just up the shore, about an hour from Duluth, is a fantastic spot (stay at the Cove Point Lodge!). Congratulations! :)"
duluth,3cmwa3,FriendzonePhill,3,Thu Jul 9 19:56:19 2015 UTC,"Congratulations lovebirds!  Duluth (on a good day) is the best city in the U.S. On a bad day … well, we won't mention what it becomes.   Tip 1: Pack a few warm clothes. Lake Superior is mighty, transcending weather patterns in other flatlands like the Twin Cities. Don't overdo it, but pack a sweatshirt, a solid rain jacket, and a pair of jeans, and a powerful bug spray. You may just have the 90-100 degree weather that lingered in June-July of 2009. But the lake might push some cold weather your way, too.   Tip 2: Hike past the airport on Park Point for a trip back in time. A sand trail will lead you to an abandoned lighthouse that locals have often explored. The trail goes through old-growth Red and White Pine trees that whistle in the wind. And if you take a spur to the beach, you'll have a section of the largest freshwater beach on the world to restate your vows, build a driftwood fort, and maybe even have a romantic moment at sunset. Do swim in the Lake and laugh at the other tourists who say ""It's too cold."" That's baloney. It's only cold for the first five minutes. Stick it out. Do, however, wear close-toed shoes on this trail—there is a lot of poison ivy growing over the dunes and around the trees.  Tip 3: Check out Rick Allen's print shop in the Dwitt-Seitz building. The prints offer a humorous Northerly take on living next to the greatest lake—and they are wonderful work. The print shop offers a friendly look into the process of printmaking.   Tip 4: Pizza Train. It's an old train where you can eat pizza and ride.   Tip 5: I know you're looking for things to do, but here's another Northland tip, if you're interested in being a temporary local: Read some Louis Jenkins before you both go. He's a Duluth treasure. If he's reading, maybe you can catch one of the best poets in the Midwest make the often-quiet Swedes and Norwegians laugh with their bellies."
duluth,3cmwa3,arbors_vitae,2,Thu Jul 9 21:04:09 2015 UTC,"Go for a hike in Hartley . Get a beer in Fitgers; try the Apricot Ale if they have it. Pizza Luce is really good for lunch or dinner, and it has a sweet bloody mary bar for brunch. Bellisio's is a great place for a romantic glass of wine and home-style italian food. Drive across the bridge to Superior, WI and have a burger at the Anchor. It's top-notch for burgers and Wisconsin beer.  If you have time, head up the road to Gooseberry Falls. It's a beautiful outdoor area.  Beyond this, you're looking at a lot of bars. There are some great outdoor activities, but there's a lot of drinking going on in the Northland."
duluth,3cmwa3,jesse_dev,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"I'm certainly not a Duluth native but I've spent some time in the area during all the seasons at some point in my life. A couple recommendations for honeymooners:  The New Scenic Cafe is a bit more classy/expensive and is located about 20 minutes north of Duluth right on the shore and has some amazing food. Their menu changes throughout the year and has yet to disappoint, we have made it a tradition to stop in for dinner whenever we are in the area. Also, the desserts are amazing! I'd definitely recommend getting a reservation as the last few times we were in we overheard the hosts giving out 1 hour+ wait times to those without while we were seated inside 10 minutes.   Uncle Loui's is another local spot that has phenomenal breakfast foods in HUGE portions. The coffee is on point as well. Definitely count on waiting a bit to get in, as the line goes out the door during prime hours (well worth the wait though!).  If weather permits and you're looking for a place nearby to walk off some of your food and drink experiences, check out the trails around Lester Park. We had our engagement photos here... The trails are long enough for a nice walk and there's plenty of room for a bit of exploring down to the waters edge for picture perfect settings."
duluth,3cmwa3,snowfaced,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"During the week, up the north shore at the resorts, like Grand Superior Lodge, or Superior Shores are very nice.  Right on the lake, more private, and only a 30-45 minute drive from canal park if you want to do city exploring."

Before you know it management approved ""women with young children"" spots without being exactly sure why they were doing it.

The inside seats near the windows are nice also.  Mexico Lindo has the best deck, but the food is hit or miss.  Midi (Fitger's building) has a nice patio but set back from the lake. A few seafood items on the menu.  You could also get sandwiches from Northern Waters Smokehouse and eat them on the 'bridge' behind Fitger's.  In Two Harbors I think the best option might be the deck at Castle Danger Brewery. It's not that close to the lake, and they don't serve food. You could order pizza from Do North and eat it there.  *I forgot about the old Lakeview Castle. I think it's called the Clearwater Grill.

I have a 3 and a 1 year old and when we go to Canal Park they absolutely love feeding the nasty seagulls by the light houses.   Bayfront Park is located in front of the Aquarium and is fun for kids.  I recommend the Aquarium, but it is expensive.   Duluth Children's museum is off of the 27th ave east exit between the highway and superior st. It shares a lot with Heritage Ice Arena and Clyde Iron Works. There's a decent amount of activities, but it's pricey and 1 maybe a little young for the childrens museum.  The depot is fun for kids and is located off of 5th ave East and Michigan st. downtown, they also have actual train rides up the shore to two harbors you can take. My kids loved it.   The Zoo, we actually just went on Saturday. It did flood so they lost their big attraction the polar bears and seals, but it's a good small zoo for young kids. They enough to keep them interested Lions, Tiger, bears, monkeys. They also have a petting zoo with Llamas and goats. They just recently started a small train ride that goes around the grounds for 2.00 a person over 2 years old.   My kids like going up to Enger Tower and climbing around and looking out over the city.   There's plenty to do, even if you're going down to the water side my kids will spend all day throwing rocks into the lake.   Enjoy."

duluth,3b3nx6,jotsea,8,Fri Jun 26 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"Hi! I would definitely recommend Duluth Grill- they have breakfast and lunch! They are in West Duluth and all their food is organic/home grown.  In terms of doing something fun, I think our hiking trails are the absolute shit. Anywhere along the Superior Hiking trail is awesome. Hartley Nature Center, the Boardwalk, hiking at the end of Park Point... all these trails are great if you want to stretch your feet and enjoy some stuff. If you don't have that much time, I'd still go the Boardwalk because it's classically touristy, with shops and a nice path/beach/view of Lake Superior. Hope this helps and enjoy our little city!"
duluth,3b3nx6,Life_Cats_and_Booty,3,Thu Jun 25 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"Seconding Duluth Grill, and to add on more sights if you do the boardwalk you can hit up the Portland Malt Shoppe for dessert. I'd also like to add Enger Park; you can see the historic building, as well as check out the hill gazebo for some perfect backgrounds of the city and lift bridge if you want to take a photo to commemorate the pit stop :)  You might also want to take a peek at the visit Duluth site, though it's more aiming at long term stays.  Hope you enjoy Duluth, and thanks for visiting!"

duluth,3b3nx6,Devdogg,2,Fri Jun 26 16:38:51 2015 UTC,"Since most suggestions are that you drive all around town and not stay downtown...  For lunch, northern waters smokehaus is a good stop, though there are many local places right in Canal Park. Personally, I love all kinds of food, cannot recommend everything enough. If you're a burgers type of person, Fitgers, the 7 west taphouse and the canal park brewery are all excellent places. If you stop at fitgers and you like beer, or even root beer, grab a growler to take with you.  comic shop, yeah, Rogue Robot is the only place in the downtown area. It's a good place if you like Warhammer or other miniature games or board games.  As far as supplies, I would recommend waiting until you pass through Virginia, (assuming you are taking highway 53 north and not 61- the senic route) there's a target, walmart and super one grocery store all right there, but I only suggest it as it's more ""on the way"" than stopping anywhere in Duluth.  As far as sight seeing goes, I can't help you there. I hate the outdoors."

duluth,3au503,liampool218,4,Tue Jun 23 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"The breweries in St. Paul most likely don't give a shit about this. The amount of reciprocity between craft breweries across this state is undeniable.  More or less, everyone wants everyone else to succeed. The main difference is the fact that St. Paul doesn't need the tourist increase that this title could afford them. People visit the Twin Cities regardless.  Whereas for Duluth, this type of advertising is what helps drive the non-industrial portion of this town's economy."
duluth,3au503,beefinbed,-30,Wed Jun 24 05:15:39 2015 UTC,"Straight up bitch Duluthian move... the mayor is just making up shit to try to improve their tourism. According to The Brewer's Association, the top 3 craft breweries in MN are (big surprise) not located anywhere near Duluth. Schell's obviously produces the most. I didn't even have to google that to be sure, but feel free to click the link if you don't believe me.  The metro area has no less than 36 craft breweries, which is far more than anywhere else in the state. This really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.  Tl;dr Fuck off Duluth."
duluth,3au503,Minn4theWin,9,Tue Jun 23 16:46:31 2015 UTC,Tl;dr Fuck off Duluth.   That's a bold move in /r/duluth. Let's see if it pays off.
duluth,3au503,alexanderwales,4,Tue Jun 23 20:28:53 2015 UTC,I don't even like living in Duluth and I'm giving this minn4theturd dingus a downvote.
duluth,3au503,beaverTaco,21,Tue Jun 23 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"There are about 3,800,000 people in the metro area with those 36 breweries, making a ratio of approximately 105,555 people per brewery. Duluth has 6 breweries for a little less than 90,000 people, which works out to a ratio of 15,000 people per brewery. Due to sheer size yes the metro area wins, because it has more people. Duluth wins this one.   TL;DR Fuck you."
duluth,3au503,BobLobLawsLawFirm,4,Tue Jun 23 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"If you're going to use only Duluth's population and not the metropolitan area why not do the same for Minneapolis? With a population of 400,000 and 22 breweries located within Minneapolis that works out to a ratio of 18,181 people per brewery. Or St. Paul's population of 295,000 and 14 breweries for ratio of 21,000 people per brewery. Not quite as big of a difference then."
duluth,3au503,3030tron,6,Tue Jun 23 20:58:53 2015 UTC,Still sounds like Duluth wins.
duluth,3au503,whiskey_nick,-11,Tue Jun 23 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"If you're going with ratios, Duluth doesn't even come close.  2013 population of New Ulm:  13,210  2013 population of Duluth: 86,128  New Ulm production of beer: 145,000 barrels per year  Duluth production of beer: 20,000 barrels per year  New Ulm: 10.98 barrels of beer per capita  Duluth: 0.23 barrels of beer per capita  r/theydidthemath"

We were focusing on number of breweries from the metro and Duluth so that's a different argument. One thing with your argument you have to take into consideration is the type of license these breweries have. Schells has a production line that sells beer in liquor stores, while the Brewhouse can't bottle and sell their beer in stores, reducing the barrels produced. Therefore you have an unfair comparison.    Also logically all of that beer from Schells isn't only going to New Ulm, so you can't just use the population from New Ulm. Are you suggesting that 13,210 people drink all of the Schells beer produced in New Ulm?  /r/ContextIsEverything"

duluth,3au503,obsidianop,4,Tue Jun 23 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with OC but Schells is absolutely craft beer -- not just by the industry-accepted definition, but because they make some legitimately interesting brews. Their series of Berliner Weisses is pretty commonly considered to be really excellent; Firebrick and Pils are both super high on ratebeer. Just because their beers are different than the new crop of crafts (German styles instead of IPAs) does not mean they don't make good beer. We should consider ourselves lucky to have the third oldest brewery in the country in our state. They still brew all their beer in a facility that was literally attacked by Indians."
duluth,3au503,Minn4theWin,-5,Wed Jun 24 03:54:25 2015 UTC,"The Brewers Association defines American craft brewers as ""small, independent and traditional"": ""small"" is defined as an ""annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less"". Schell's produces FAR less than that, they are family owned, and their brewing methods come straight from Germany.  Also, comparing Schell's to Nickelback is like comparing Matt's or the 5-8 Club to McDonald's. Or like comparing Kate Upton to your mom. Or like comparing the Boundary Waters to Lake Karachay. Or like comparing Game of Thrones to Keeping Up with the Kardashians."
duluth,3au503,beaverTaco,2,Tue Jun 23 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"""Brewers Association""  These business associations make up whatever bullshit that suits them.  6 million barrels is ridiculous, Black Label puts out less than six million barrels and it's piss water.  Matt's and the 5-8 suck.  Congrats you put some cheese in some ground beef, it's the same crap gimmick as Pizza Hut's stuffed crust pizza.  And while I'm at it I should add Fat Lorenzo's tastes like left over Lean Cuisine.  Schell's tastes like it ran off of Paul Bunyan's taint in a heatwave."

Do keep in mind that many shops will only pay 50% cash for sought after cards, and not much at all for bulk that they won't be able to move.  4th Edition/Fallen Empires/Ice Age/Homelands/ were some of the first massively printed sets and there is no shortage in finding them in bulk bins even today.  Older sets are where the money lies, with exception of a few high value cards in Alliances and Mirage.  However I would warn that 4th edition especially really doesn't have much value anymore.

duluth,39w0e6,AirborneMoxen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"Checking online buylists, It looks like $40 is the most you could reasonably expect to get. Most of the cards that are under $1 have essentially no value and most stores wouldn't be interested in them. There are a few higher end singles (Sylvan Library, Ashnod's Altar, Arcades) that a store would be interested in, but for the most part it is not worth much at all."

duluth,39w0e6,Horse625,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:26:03 2015 UTC,"Dungeon's End is definitely your best bet.  The owner of Rogue Robot will do anything he can to screw people over for profit (actually screwed over Dragonport in the first place to get the store space), while the owner of Dungeon's End frequently goes out of his way to build a lasting and positive community for gamers.  They'll give you specific prices on anything rare, or bulk prices by the inch."
duluth,39w0e6,Pronell,0,Mon Jun 15 16:11:33 2015 UTC,Stay clear of Dungeon's End.  They screwed over a buddy of mine. Gave him two hundred for a box of cards including a black lotus.
duluth,39w0e6,BobLobLawsLawFirm,3,Mon Jun 15 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"$200 for a Collector's or International Edition Black Lotus is about what you should expect when you sell to a store, maybe slightly on the low side. However, you have to agree to a sale so if they are buying for 50% of the value you don't have to sell it to them. Most stores are going to pay between 50-70% of value.  If it was an Unlimited or Beta Edition then your buddy is an idiot for selling it for $200."
duluth,39w0e6,Pronell,0,Mon Jun 15 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"It would've been unlimited, and yes he was stupid. But I still can't trust that store to not screw me over. There are other options in town."

duluth,396mz2,SHUT_UP_little_man,3,Wed Jun 10 02:24:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely with your assessment. This is an excellent way to make 3rd and 4th parry candidates more viable. In an election where a significant portion of the population agrees more with a fringe candidate, if they vote that way, they often just pull votes away from one party and allow a less popular main party candidate to win. To prevent this from happening, many voters vote for the main party candidate that they agree with most just so the opposition doesn't win. This is flawed.   Now, let's consider an example. Imagine an election between 4 candidates. There is much contention among the people over whether candidates A, B, or C should be elected, but the general consensus is that candidate D is a good second choice. On election day, candidates A, B, and C are picked as 1st, 3rd, and 4th choices more or less evenly, while candidate D gets picked as 2nd by most people. As it turns out, the most people agree the most with candidate D. Most people are disappointed that their main candidate didn't win, but are happy that the two they didn't like didn't win and that their second choice won. In a normal election, either A, B, or C would have won. One third of the people would have happy about their guy winning, but two thirds of the people would be mad about that one winning.     Situations like this are why ranked choice voting would be good. If someone campaigns as a second choice candidate, it's undoubtedly because they are a middle choice with the best qualities of the other sides, and I don't see why they shouldn't win."

duluth,38mpkd,celeryburger2,5,Fri Jun 5 05:21:04 2015 UTC,Check out Enger Park on the top of the hill. There's an old tower with some of the best views of the city. Also canal park is a must. The aerial lift bridge is really popular with photographers.
duluth,38mpkd,nslade,5,Fri Jun 5 11:56:04 2015 UTC,"If you're okay with taking a little drive up the shore, head to two harbors and head to the breakwater. You can walk all the way to the end. There is also a lighthouse you can tour if you are interested. If you're willing to drive a little farther, there is Split Rock Lighthouse which is also really cool."
duluth,38mpkd,pattyboy77,2,Fri Jun 5 12:02:36 2015 UTC,"I'd second this.  Duluth itself is lovely, but a drive up the along the shore will give you all the photo eye candy you'd want.  I'd recommend continuing up past Split Rock even and head towards Grand Marias.  It's a jaunt, but you'll have some pretty amazing scenery."
duluth,38mpkd,meatwhisper,4,Fri Jun 5 13:55:29 2015 UTC,Drive along Skyline Parkway. On the west end you overlook the St. Louis River and on the east end you overlook Lake Superior. Enger Tower is right in the middle and would be a good place to have a picnic.

It's your best bet to get there early and pray for a spot! Since you'll only be there two days a week, $6 for all day parking ain't bad"
duluth,38iqyv,adultishgambino,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:28:17 2015 UTC,I work in the US Bank building and have a pass for that ramp... and half the time if I am coming in later in the day I can't find a spot as it is.  It wasn't so bad until they closed the Wells Fargo ramp.
duluth,38iqyv,whitneyyyl,6,Thu Jun 4 21:00:04 2015 UTC,All free street parking third street and above. Though third street has meters east of lake ave. West of it has none.
duluth,38iqyv,kpraslowicz,2,Thu Jun 4 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"The challenge here is that Third Street fills up by 7:30 AM usually, so it helps to be DT before that.   Otherwise 4th St has parking most the day."
duluth,38iqyv,DuggleAss,2,Thu Jun 4 17:00:46 2015 UTC,The Ramp behind the courthouse is usually with space and costs $3 for 9 hours of parking.  That's about $24/mo for you varying on the shift in weeks month to month.  The biggest issue right now is that ever since all the construction started downtown there is less places to park as a result of missing spaces as well the construction workers taking up space.
duluth,38iqyv,DuggleAss,2,Thu Jun 4 17:01:53 2015 UTC,"Shoppers auto park on 2nd ave w has pretty cheap daily rates, I think it's around $3"

duluth,38iqyv,SteppingSplash,2,Thu Jun 4 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"I work in the US Bank building and use the ramp. I have a pass now, but $6 isn't too bad.  I used to park at the DECC before, which I think is $5 a day or $50 a month. That option isn't as convenient when the Northwest Passage closes in a couple weeks, but the DTA will be running a shuttle."
duluth,38iqyv,Floodwood,2,Thu Jun 4 22:50:17 2015 UTC,U.S. Bank lot doesn't have a gate or bar or anything stopping you from just driving away without paying.  Just sayin'.
duluth,38iqyv,Horse625,2,Fri Jun 5 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"Shoppers Auto Park almost always has space even if you come in later in the day but beware of cave like seepage from upper levels and crumbling concrete floors and stairs. It is cheap though! The attendant is usually gone after 6pm or so, so if you were to just grab a ticket and leave later in the day you would be golden."

duluth,3864wz,sideburn_sensei,3,Tue Jun 2 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"You have an aquarium visit planned for a bachelor party? smh, i've never used that phrase, but come on, honestly??  I would say Canal Park Brewery is a good place for some dinner to start the night, then from there you can go to a handful of decent bars in canal, or you can walk across the street and go to club saratoga (titty bar).  Also, downtown is only a 10 minute walk away, there are plenty of fun bars.  My top picks for when I go home are tycoons(basement), carmody's, red herring, luce.  Also, see if you can get a brewery tour at Bent Paddle, it is only $1 or a canned food item, and it's all you can drink, and they have the best beer known to mankind; they usually run Sunday mornings"
duluth,3864wz,christoffer_jay,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"To clarify, we hadn't decided yet if going to the aquarium was something that we wanted to do, but as some in the group are from out of state, and those of us that are MN residents haven't spent much time in Duluth, we had a pretty limited perspective on stuff we could do during lulls between drinking. Appreciate the tips."
duluth,3864wz,bubonictonic,3,Tue Jun 2 15:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, don't go to the aquarium. Hit up Canal Park and the downtown environs, as Christopher jay said. In between drinking walk down to the pier, get a burger at 7 west, or go over the bridge to the Anchor or Pagan. Go to Carmody, Fitger's, Sir Ben's, all on superior st. Go to the Wabasha on 1st st. for shits n giggles. Also check out twinportsnightlife.com and check out some local live music. Have fun!"
duluth,3864wz,blueit22,2,Tue Jun 2 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I third not going to the aquarium.  The bars on Superior Street are better than Canal Park. Tycoons, Luce (bar is in the back room), Carmody, Dublins, 7 West, etc. Just wander around and find some bars on Superior Street.   The Saratoga is a must for a bachelor party. But if you want more options there are two strip clubs in Superior across the street from each other. Lady Vis and Centerfolds.  Late at night once you're good and hammered go to the flame, aces, or spurs. More of a party atmosphere there than the other bars on Superior st."
duluth,3864wz,Dave_Hulud,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for mischief, there is the Toga on Canal (Personally not recommended but it's there), otherwise a lot of bars in canal/downtown area.  Are you staying at a hotel anywhere or crashing at a house?  Do you guys want bars/events/ or something else?

Here are a few though:  Breakfast: Uncle Louie's and the Duluth Grill are fantastic. Absolutely essential.  Everything else: Pizza Luce (which also has a great brunch) is a bit hipster but has great food. I like Tycoons, especially for the deep fried pickles. The Brewhouse has some great burgers and is a pretty good Microbrewery. 7 West Taphouse also has pretty good burgers. The best burgers in town though, for my money are at The Anchor-It's a hole-in the wall type place across the bridge in Superior.  Uuuuuh, let's see. Stay away from Grandma's, never had a good meal there. Uuuuuum, I'll think about it a bit and might add more later.  I won't suggest any Mexican, as I'm told it's trash compared to what you're used to."

No idea if you are of drinking age, but nothing helps wash down a hangover quite like uncle louies. Just be sure to get there early or a bit later in the morning as that place can be absolutely packed on sat/sun.  Edit: stay away from Mexican food. But Chinese up here is suprisingly good.

Most of the ""openings"" I've seen are those remote technician jobs, where you dont actually get hourly/salary but paid by the contract with a lot of driving. I did a stint up at Computer Renaissance before the economy hit the shitter and they had to let me go, good place - but not really where you'd use a networking degree.  You could check out Compudyne, but all theyre offering right now is a SysAdmin spot that requires 2+ years in the industry. Involta has a SysAdmin spot for their data center, but it requires 5+ years experience.  Sadly, I personally agree with looking into options in the Twin Cities if you have your heart set on IT. There could be more options if things turn more business friendly - or if we can get the city to build a municipal ISP using the fiber lines. But those are both apparently a long way off."

Common sense and humanity where is it?   Leave the Bear alone it will go home (Downtown Duluth)   If everyone would leave the Bear alone it would go back from where it came from. It is scared with all the Geeks taking pictures and staring at it like he is in a zoo. Once it is dark out it will scamper back into the country.

duluth,346zhw,gAlienLifeform,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:15:01 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to why you would link to a Twin Cities news source for a Duluth story.
duluth,341c34,gAlienLifeform,9,Mon Apr 27 15:08:21 2015 UTC,"I have a problem with the way these studies are presented. I don't doubt that alcoholism is a huge problem, but they never link to studies that define ""binge drinking"" and ""heavy alcohol use"".  In the survey they did, they considered four drinks in one sitting to be binge drinking. If I have four drinks during the course of a football game I am now a binge drinker. According to a simple BAC calculator I could expect to have a BAC of .035%, less than half than what would be considered impaired driving.  Another chart they show is for heavy drinkers. Men who drink two drinks a day are considered heavy drinkers. According to the Mayo Clinic an adult male may drink up to two drinks a day before the negative consequences outweigh the positive benefits. It seems odd that there is no buffer between a healthy amount and a dangerous amount of alcohol.  As for the Twin Ports having a higher percentage of drinkers, I think that can be attributed to the high percentage of college students. We have three universities in a fairly small city.  Edit: We also seem to have a large population of mentally ill/homeless, but I'm not sure if they'd get called by a phone survey."
duluth,341c34,cb1037,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"Ability to drive does not correlate with health. Just for fun, I told that BAC calculator that I had 16 drinks in 19 hours. It said I was .38 -- legal to drive. But drinking 16 drinks a day is definitely unhealthy.  There's a line between what's ok and what's unhealthy. Yeah, it isn't a magic line that's perfect. But if you're drinking frequently or excessively, chances are you are on the unhealthy side of that line. If you're riding the line, you're probably ok for now, but you might want to make sure you're keeping it in check."
duluth,341c34,Handseamer,3,Tue Apr 28 05:41:26 2015 UTC,"No denial here, I drink way too much. I drank a six-pack during the last Wild game and I probably average three drinks a day. I never drive once I start drinking.  I have no need to shift the blame. The latter half of my comment was merely an attempt to understand why the Twin Ports would have a significantly higher rate of drinking than other areas of northern Minnesota/Wisconsin/Michigan. I have lived in areas of each state where alcoholism is at least as much of a problem as it is here."

The guy driving wasn't just one of the best DTA drivers, he was the best driver. 30 year perfect safety record, no discipline issues, model driver. Couldn't have happened to someone more surprising.

They are also almost always selling canoes and kayaks.   I believe there is one in Grand Marais, and every other store front in Ely is an outfitter.  Searching ""canoe"" or ""kayak"" on duluth.craigslist came up with a number of specimens from $125-$1000  As for canoe vs. kayak, canoes are more versatile, and carry more stuff.  Kayaks are more sea worthy being able to take waves over the bow  and efficient to paddle."

duluth,336s5h,Eredic,5,Mon Apr 20 01:56:03 2015 UTC,"I came here for school, and have lived here for 7 years now.  One thing to keep in mind is not to make the mistake of thinking Duluth has the same weather as TC.  Many fronts from the Northwest end up driving right below the lake in Winter and Spring making for what is often a 10-20 degree difference between Duluth and TC during these times(Brrr).  I do love Duluth none the less, there is nothing better than having a lake view to wake up to each morning.  If you are a fan of smaller more relaxed crowds, the Duluth/Northshore nightlife definitely has its charm.  The most surprising part of the area is the variation in landscapes.  From the crags and rushing water of Jay Cooke to the palisades and falls of the Nor' Shore, there is enough to keep you busy for years, especially if you xcountry ski.  Keep in mind this is all within 50 miles of Duluth(not to mention, the remoteness of the inland Pine Forests).  If you are thinking about moving into the city limits, the accessibility of the outdoors is always short walk away, with parks scattered across town you can feel like you are miles from civilization in Chester Creek, Lester, or Hartley(a personal favorite with it's expansive 360 view) each offering a unique experience."
duluth,336s5h,hlabar,2,Mon Apr 20 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"We love all the activities on the North Shore. We were married at Superior Shores a few years back, and we'll be back up there in the first week of May to celebrate our anniversary. I proposed to her at Twin Points, which is at mile marker 42 between Gooseberry and Split Rock and has some of the most incredible beaches on the entire lake. The city is the best, and I think that we would definitely appreciate the slower lifestyle, but the biggest part is that we would be all that much closer to the places that have become so special to us. Even writing this, I can't wait to get back up there and head down to the canal or up to Enger tower. We'd like to find a smaller, traditional-style house in the Congdon, Chester Park, Lakeside/Lester Park area. The nice thing is that my wife works in healthcare, and it seems like there's a lot of opportunities for that type of employment. It would most likely be something we looked to do next year, but we both feel like the more we plan and the more questions we ask, the better prepared we'll be. At this point, one of my biggest concerns is that we'd like to rent for a bit while we acclimate to the city and find the house we really want, but the rental market seems crazy tight up there. Thanks for the great response!"
duluth,336s5h,Superior111,3,Mon Apr 20 10:55:59 2015 UTC,"If you love the outdoors and all of the trails Duluth has to offer, I wouldn't rule out West Duluth.  With all the money going into the St.Louis River project, it's only going to get better.  I would say the growth of West Duluth can only be rivaled by the Miller Hill area.  Grocery, restaurants, fast food, convenient stores, home improvement all under 5 min drives from most places in West Duluth, not to mention the proximity of trail systems.  I know most people still have this vision of West Duluth as the ghetto and run down side of town, but it's really not.  West of Wade Stadium has some very nice neighborhoods, don't let anyone fool you.  Just thought I would give you another option just in case."
duluth,336s5h,bonerwashington,8,Tue Apr 21 06:11:08 2015 UTC,"I moved to Duluth from the East Coast. Now that I've been here for a while, it's lovely. But for the first two years, well, I have an analogy. Have you ever been the passenger in a vehicle when the driver hits the brakes unexpectedly? If it's just the right moment in your respiration, and if the seatbelt catches you right in the middle of your belly, it forces all the air out of your lungs. You can't breathe. You're surprised that the car is still slowing down. Somehow it's still happening. You still, unbelievably, can't catch your breath. When you move to Duluth, that seat belt squeezes for about a year and a half to two years. The pace of life here is much, much slower. I'd say for me that it feels kind of like a secret hideout. Like a fort you would build as a kid.   My friends told me before I moved here that Duluth was clique-y. They were right. But give it some time, and there are some very nice people here."
duluth,336s5h,magicuserbaby,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Had the exact same experience, your analogy is perfect. It was the two-year mark for me when everything fell into place."
duluth,336s5h,bubonictonic,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"I love that analogy. I love the idea of living a cozy little life in a cute traditional house with a front porch and a fireplace, and maybe a view of the Lake from the big, open room in the attic. I love the thought of a 10-minute drive to work, of dropping my wife off before heading into the office, and of picking her up at the end of the day so we can go for a stroll on the Lakewalk before dinner."
duluth,336s5h,meatwhisper,2,Tue Apr 21 00:57:38 2015 UTC,"You've just described my life. Except I walk to work down the hill, and boyfriend picks me up (no way I'm walking up the steepest hill in town). We live in top of the hill with a gorgeous view. The tradeoffs are that it is windy and chillier when sometimes it can be 10-20 degrees warmer over thehill, and some people think the hillside is dangerous. Yes there are some lower income streets in the hillside but all my neighbors are wonderful. The good outweighs the bad. And it's like being in the arts and theatre kids clique instead of the cool kids clique. Duluth is amazing. Embrace it."
duluth,336s5h,Brittany_Delirium,2,Fri May 1 22:23:32 2015 UTC,"Grew up and spent my 20's in Duluth, and while a lot has changed just be aware that it's a much smaller town and with that comes ""small town problems"" that you'd encounter in ANY smaller city.     The job market in the TC is pretty amazing right now.  Duluth, not so sure.  I know a couple of people going back to school up there because jobs are tight.  Also means that you might see fewer jobs in specialized fields and more people applying for those jobs.  In the TC if you found an issue like that you could wait a few weeks for more similar postings to show up.  What I'd honestly recommend is finding a place in the TC that will let you work remotely. Weather is FAR colder there.  When I moved to the TC I thought I was in a tropical paradise by comparison.  Also the lake effect snow is no joke.  If you hate the winters here, you'll be more miserable there.  Also, you've got those hills to worry about if you live downtown.   Sure cliques will be a thing, but I found people in Duluth to be MUCH friendlier than in the TC by and large.  Only bad thing is that if you have a bad experience with someone, you will likely see that person again in your day to day.  It's not like in the cities where if you have a falling out you really only see them if you hang in the same circles.  ""Let's not go to X place since Tim will be there.""  Guess what, Tim shops at the same Target and eat at the same Chipotle as you in Duluth... because he has no other options.  Also means gossip can travel at the speed of light.  You get on someone's shit list, everyone knows. If you get sick of the local place to hang out or eat... well there a ton of options for backup in the TC.  Not so much in a smaller town.  ""The worst place in town"" is sometimes the ONLY place in town.     Overall though, I would have stayed in Duluth had the job market been better at the time and had my friends not all moved away to the Twin Cities.  I sometimes drive through to visit family and am proud how much it's grown and expanded... but still see it as a much smaller town than I did growing up."
duluth,336s5h,RedBeardedWonder,2,Mon Apr 20 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"I would say that the job thing is the biggest concern we have right now, next to leaving behind all the people we know here in the Cities. Luckily, my wife is in healthcare, and with Duluth being the medical hub of the area, it shouldn't be too difficult for her to find work, but the big question there is whether or not she would be able to find something that was at least comparable in compensation. As for me, I just started a data processing job, and I'm fairly certain that I could transfer to telecommuting, which would mean Cities'-level wages while living in Duluth.   As for the weather, we like the long winters, and it's honestly one of the draws for the area. We hate the hot, humid summers here, and we both love getting out in the snow. We've taken a huge liking to snow-shoeing, and I want to get my wife on skis at some point here. When we were up there in Feb, we were some of the only goofballs walking out on the ice, past the lighthouse. That was incredible.   We are hoping that moving to a smaller town would bring about a greater sense of community. Right now we live in a neighborhood where no one even waves at each other. I understand that you're not going to pop right in and be everyone's friend, but it would be nice to have the opportunity to meet new people and maybe join a club or two.   We're always able to find something to eat when we're up there, but yes, the choices are a bit more limited. Right now, we're loving the Duluth Grill. We had our wedding reception at the New Scenic Cafe, and you can't beat places like Little Angie's or Fitger's.   Thank you for the well-thought out response. It's given me much to think about. I like the idea of living in a small town and going at a small town pace. It would be different; a whole lot different in some ways, and it might also be a bit harder. Right now, I can get in my car and be at Target in less than three minutes. That ain't gonna happen if we're in Congdon.   There's something about it though... something that gets in your blood and your bones and calls you back to the Lake as often as possible, and even if my life up there closely resembled the one I have down here in all its banal glory, just being able to glace out my window at that vast expanse might make life all that much more enjoyable."
duluth,336s5h,achubbo,2,Tue Apr 21 00:51:34 2015 UTC,"My partner and I actually started in Duluth, moved to the cities for a year, then moved back. Looking back at it, I don't know what ever possessed us to leave. It's really a great place to live, I don't know that I'd want to live anywhere else. Jobs are a little harder to get but if you have any kind of specialization it should be pretty easy to find work. I do miss some of my cities friends, but we had to do what was right for us and living here has been everything I have hoped it would be."
duluth,336s5h,meatwhisper,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:33:22 2015 UTC,"That's kind of where we're at right now. We recently found out that we can't have children, and while we're both still facing that reality, we have come to understand that we might have some options open to us that may not have presented themselves if we'd had a baby. There's a freedom there, and with that freedom comes the opportunity to do something crazy like moving to Duluth. I figure, if it doesn't work out, we can always move back to the Cities."
duluth,336s5h,kpraslowicz,3,Wed Apr 22 01:16:17 2015 UTC,I moved here for the lake & the view. Every time I drive down Mesaba I get a nice reminder of why this is the best place in Minnesota.

duluth,330ic9,bubonictonic,2,Sat Apr 18 13:29:04 2015 UTC,"Mission Creek would be my first recommendation for you. New trail system with wide smooth rolling trails. Long system with some nice scenery.  Brewer Park is is a little tougher, but not too much. Most of it is smooth, but it can get a bit more technical once you start hitting the area where you have to go over boulders.  No problem if you at least a season of general riding experience. Doesn't seem to be an official trail map for it yet.  Lester River system is nice. The New Duluth Traverse trail that runs along the river is new and easy, and also a lot of fun. For the rest of the trails, the trails West of Seven Bridges road are far less technical than the stuff to the east of the road. I usually take people up the western trail, and down the traverse as an introduction to the system.  Piedmont is fairly technical. The trail map showing only ""More difficult"" and a above markings I'd say is true."
duluth,330ic9,kpraslowicz,2,Sat Apr 18 18:11:48 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, one thing of note is monitoring the condition of the trails, I know I was over in Lester a weekend ago and they were still very very soft.  Last I've heard, no trails in town were open for riding yet.  http://wp.coggs.com/ is the place to go as /u/bubonictonic mentioned.

Wikipedia says it better than I can:   While Wright had planned to install overhead gas pumps suspended from the canopy to add space, local safety regulations compelled him to install conventional ground-based pumps.  An observation lounge with glass walls is located beneath the canopy; this space was originally intended to be the social center envisioned in the Broadacre City plans.   Social center.

duluth,324mj7,4-bit,4,Sat Apr 11 01:58:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  They always start advertising pre-registration before they have a schedule.  And then by the time they have a schedule, there's maybe one event that I want to attend, a Heroclix tournament.  But there's not even anything special about that and it costs like $80 to go to the same kind of tournament with the same people that go to Dungeon's End on Saturdays."
duluth,325nev,badnerk,3,Fri Apr 10 19:58:37 2015 UTC,"That's easier. Where are you staying?  For brewpubs there's Fitger's Brewhouse or Canal Park Brewery.  For off sale beer there's Bent Paddle and Lake Superior Brewery.  If you want to drink 30 beers and never have the same one twice theres 7 West Taphouse or Old Chicago.  The liquor store in the Fitger's building has a pricy selection. Lake Aire Bottleshop where Hwy 35 and London Road come together has a good selection and will be right on the way back north.  Mexico Lindo in the Fitger's building has a huge tequila collection. It's a good place to get drunk but not so much to eat at.  If I were spending a weekend drinking in Duluth I'd just hang out at the Fitger's building. Usually at least three live bands to choose from at night.  There are ton's of other places in the area, it depends on whether you want to stay close to your hotel."
