But you really shouldnt leave your family and possible friends behind. Think how sad everyone will be to know that you've gone out with the worst way possible. You shoudln't spread the sadness. You should extinguish it.  I Would suggest calling a hotline right now.
SuicideWatch,3e4991,HiVenom,0,Tue Jul 21 22:11:27 2015 UTC,Maybe a little background as to why you've come to this decision? Obviously your seeking some sort of consolation or else you wouldn't have announced this on the internet.
SuicideWatch,3e4991,piles_of_SSRIs,0,Tue Jul 21 22:13:03 2015 UTC,"Do me a favor if you will.  On Wednesday, go to the bridge without the rope.  Sit on the edge and look down.  Just look down and think.  Think of the decision you are about to make.  Think of the finality of your decision and what those consequences will be.  Think of your problems, what's driving you to this decision and what can be done about them.  If you can do absolutely anything about those problems, anything at all that can change those problems, do it.  Don't just abandon them, because problems don't go away, they're just transferred.  You will probably see a lot at the bottom of that drop, but the one thing I want you to look for is your grievance.  Once you find it, it's up to you how you want to handle it, but I strongly encourage you to not run away from it, get angry that it drove you to this point.  Get angry and refuse to let it throw you off the edge.  You make your choices, everything else is just in the background.  Look into the depth and find a way out."

Makes me sad but i want to get my message out there..  Basically it's worth working hard and earning money so you can empower yourself to do the things you really want to do. I don't like my job; i'm overworked and under appreciated for being a smart and hard worker, but i keep going because that money i'm earning can really help me record music, which is my hobby and my passion.   So i don't claim to know the answer, but i know what keeps me going. So many of my heroes have been self destructive and/or depressed. Many died early from their way of life, but they inspired and changed the world for so many that it seemed valuable for those people to trudge through life even when it was difficult. (Look into D. Boon of Minutemen, Mark Linkus of Sparklehorse, Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic, Syd Barret of Pink Floyd, Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead (how apropos), Frank Zappa of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, ext..) point is, these people lived unconventional lives, and changed the way people saw the world, even though these people were having trouble trying to find their own way and struggling with a lot of the same problems you and I have.  Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, i hope it makes sense."

It can never hurt to ask. I know it feels like you're the odd one out, but as someone who frequents this sub it's really pretty common for folks to have never had a girlfriend, or had a lot of difficulty dating."

Not many people replied and nobody messaged me directly."
SuicideWatch,3e3q1q,Spasmoganabulator,3,Tue Jul 21 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"Facebook is a really ineffective source of social interaction but generally I don't think folks know how to react to things like that right on the spot. The good news is though the internet has a lot of dedicated support networks. You gotta build from the inside out. It can be awesome to embrace the power you have to change what you can. It's good that you're getting out there and exercising and whatnot. Putting your best foot forward is important with dating and it bolsters confidence. With online dating, most dates are only single dates. But people you meet through a social activity are generally better fits.  People get pretty gun shy about raw public displays of emotion."
SuicideWatch,3e3q1q,Spasmoganabulator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"Very true about the 'raw displays of emotion'.

I think it's best to seek help from the willing rather than get half hearted platitudes.

Everyone at many times in their life needs someone to lean on when they are going through a rough time. You are fortunate that you around them when you are experiencing it. I know we all expect our close friends to pick up on our body language to see how we are truly feeling, but sometimes we all get caught up in our own world that we might not notice someone close to us acting a bit differently. The best thing you can do is talk to them or at least talk to your best friend in private.   I hope what I write is able to help you in someway and that your day also improves!"

I have loving parents; I was never bullied nor abused  Is there something you enjoy doing?  Have you ever considered living in another country?

SuicideWatch,3e4lz6,faeirie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"Your story sounds incredibly similar to mine. I'm quite sensitive in that when I can't be with somebody (especially physically), I start to honestly feel depressed. But it's fine. They will always be there at the end of the day for you to talk to. It's good to respect people and their need for space sometimes; they will appreciate that you care about them enough to leave them alone for a bit. Anyway, it would be nice to go over your boyfriend's and cuddle for a bit. I wish he would get you a big teddy bear to hug when you two aren't together, that would really be nice. If you are really feeling this serious and you really need some support, I think you should tell him everything you've said in this post. Even though you're giving him his space, remind him that you miss him and that you're kind of having a hard time right now. In any case, I'm really glad you're at least venting out on here. There are people who care about you, and we want you to feel better. I hate hearing the same ""it gets better"" thing, too. But honestly it WILL get better if you try to change your mindset about certain things. Maybe it's best to be alone for a while, there's a lot you can realize when you isolate yourself for some time. This may sound cliché but what do you like to do? Remind yourself to take a break from life for a bit and do something fun or entertaining. It can be something as simple as rewatching a show you used to be obsessed with. Anyway, you get the point. Sorry for the unorganized chunk of text, I'm sloppy with my thoughts.

There is nothing wrong with working and not having a lot of money especially in this economy. Staying with your mom is an economical choice. Don't let your pride get the better of you. I don't know anything about your home life, but I am sure as long as you help around the house, your mom appreciates it.   You put a lot of stress on how you didn't finish college. You can always go back for that degree. Or you can keep working. There is nothing wrong with either. You don't have to have a degree in hand to be an adult just like you don't have to be making 40,000. As long as you can pay your bills, you are an adult.

I thought that not knowing what to do was a sign that I had failed at life, that there was nothing I could do and I'd end up homeless and alone. But I realised that not knowing what you want to do is a common thing. I have friends the same age that have actually finished uni and still have no idea what they actually want to do, one is working at a shop making barely minimum wage and he's got a degree!   You just have to look for the little things that make you smile, that make you see something in yourself.

With two people working, that's $26,000 a year ($2167 per month) per adult. And most of these people didn't go to college either.  So, let's talk about peace. You said you're ready to be at peace. Sounds like you have two routes to get there.   Killing yourself. Making your 2 grand a year, and living alone in peace.   Let's take emotions out of the equation, forget about how important of a decision this is, and focus on the benefits of both options. This is a matter of choice, and it's a task you perform everyday. After all, you have made a series of choices or non-choices that has landed you in your current spot.  But, when it comes to killing yourself, there is only one real benefit to it on the road to peace: It's faster. It's the fucking dark side of the force. That's it.  But, let's talk about the benefits of that second option: Improving your situation to the point where you're living the American dream, just like everyone else.  Let's say you pull it off. (And, you will. Seriously, although it seems that way, the bar is not set that high. Believe it or not, 26k a year is perfectly attainable for someone without a college degree. Hell, you could move to Seattle where the minimum wage is $15, work a job at mcdonalds for 40 hours a week and make over $31,000 a year)  You could be at peace. You could continue to learn and grow, and maybe one day find that you've changed your mind about a few things about life and decide to take things in a completely different direction that will lead you toward happiness. Maybe not. Maybe you'll always stay the same. But, at least you'll be financially independent and living alone in peace by the power of your own two hands.  Dude, fight for your little corner of the universe."

SuicideWatch,3e4bte,thetruth320,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"I am in Canada, so take this FWIW, as the systems are different.  Not sure how your insurance works.  I suffer from severe/crippling anxiety and depression like you.  Was on meds but they stopped working. Back in early April I was told by my family doctor I'd have to wait until June to see a Psychiatrist.  2 full months!  About 3 days after that, the suicidal thoughts got so bad that I went to the ER of the closest hospital.  I was honest and told them I had a plan to kill myself, and I was in to see a psychiatrist right away.  I was then officially a patient of their mental health service, which included regular outpatient psychiatrist followups.  They eventually got me on the right meds and I'm feeling 100% better now.  So basically the way to get in to see a psychiatrist quickly here is to go through the ER of a hospital.  Tell them you're suicidal and you need to get hooked up with a psychiatrist ASAP.  Also, just to add, I did therapy too, paid $225 per session, and until the meds kicked in, my therapy sessions did dick-all.  None of the coping tools work when you're in full blown anxiety/depression, nothibg sticks.  Meds and therapy together are the fastest way out.  Unfortunately it can take awhile to find the right meds, and sometimes they stop working and you need to try other ones."

There's a lot of guilt and emptiness and feelings I'm not sure how to describe and it's been close to ten years now and I'm still amazed I've managed to exist so long in a world without her. I get by knowing that we influenced each other so strongly that she never truly left me at all. I can still hold conversations with her in my mind. I'll never forget her, I'm sure.   You're right though, nobody can know your pain.  I found some level of comfort in talking to other folks who were feeling lost. I guess I'm just trying to help where I can.

""I found some level of comfort in talking to other folks who were feeling lost."" Yeah, I agree. I think on a subconscious level this was my mind's last resort, to try and find some other people to empathise with me. I hope it doesn't sound selfish to say but only people who've gone through this horrible living nightmare can understand. It's sort of like my reality is unreal, my mind will wander from the fact that she is just...gone and then arrive at the fact again and yet I don't believe it. The fact that I don't get to say another word to her, to hear her voice again. Is there any way that gets easier, you know? I just don't see how.  And yeah, I think I will stick around here. If nothing else in this world, I want to at least try to help people."

There are still days when I have trouble reconciling that I'll never just run into her again like she was never gone. I can't promise anything will ever get easier for you, but for me it did. It got different, a little less sharp everyday. I knew the pain it caused me though and I didn't wish that on anyone else so I knew I had to stay here. I think you'll do a lot of good here.  You woke up in a nightmare today, so things will change for you. For me it was a wake-up call. I just did whatever I could to live well. It hurts feeling like things were temporary, like we could have worked things out overtime. But there are folks still alive now that if I can help them a little bit it sorta... I dunno if I'm doing penance or what but it helps."

I don't know where this will end.   I fear everyday I'm going to come home from work and find a note, or a body, or worst of all nothing at all. Just an empty apartment and my own self hatred.   I won't drag on about me. I wanted to say that I can imagine your pain, I feel some of it myself through my own situations.   I hope that means you don't have to be so alone. Through whatever means we can reach out to others who sort of feel our pain. I'd like to think that helps a little.   We do what we can. God knows I've been trying everything I can do to hold onto what's going on in my life. There's not doubt you've done the same.   We can't carry the blame, we can't carry the questions of what if and how it would be different. We tried, we were there when and how we could be and we would keep doing it if we could.   In my case, that fight is still going on. In yours, it reached a dreadful stopping point. I am sorry.   Now the focus needs to be on yourself and your needs. Seek help when and where you can, find love in friends and family or strangers on the internet."

SuicideWatch,3e3890,thrown422,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"I can relate here, at least enough to sympathize. In my past, I had a few issues where I did some things I couldn't really undo, partially due to a mental breakdown. It haunts me whenever I think of it, and I'm still sort of paying for the damages I caused. If I think too hard about it, I feel like I've just failed in a way nobody else ever has, which I eventually know is untrue once I start to get to a rational mind again. For me, the damage that resulted was a lot easier to handle once I started to accept what happened - while I was in the phase where I couldn't forgive myself, even if an opportunity presented itself I wouldn't really take it. So I suppose the first step towards feeling better is just letting the past be that.   In terms of the job stuff, have you tried everyone you used to work with in terms of references? Future employers won't know how you left a company unless someone tells you, and odds are if a job pushed you enough that you'd leave in a dramatic way then there are probably others who were thinking the things you said out loud. Usually those people are willing to have your back and provide a good reference."

Your dignity is inalienable, you get to determine your value. Folks need kindness and that's something you'll always be capable of giving.   If you're having trouble leaving the house, especially if it's due to anxiety, there are effective therapy and treatment options available.

I dunno if you've heard of a YouTube series called ""sexplanations"" but it's a fabulous sex/relationship education course.

You should take time to evaluate the relationship together to discover more how you want to progress long term.  I am sure she is aware of the issues at hand but you owe it to yourself to recognize whether she can provide the support you truly need and whether you can provide the support she truly needs.  I am a former suicide victim and obviously cannot understand your life from a few sentences but I can confidently say that I care about you, regardless what you have done in life.  I can tell you time does not heal all wounds but it definitely helps provide perspective.  Relationships are hard work and endure many struggles over time but stop to think about how small a time span in your entire lifetime this relationship is and you are already feeling this way?  Either you need to make the decision that is best for you or you need to work at it together."

I have an illness where almost 40% of people attempt suicide. That is so scary to me.   The thing about antidepressants... If the antidepressants aren't working, have you told your doctor? Every person's body is different. The same medicine can cause one person an lot of grief but completely treat another person.   I take Zoloft, and they did a test on me (something related to my liver? idk) and they found out that another drug supplemented with the zoloft (deplin) would help the zoloft work with my body chemistry.

SuicideWatch,3e154w,TheSoundDude,2,Tue Jul 21 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"What this statistic tells me is that even after attempting to kill themselves once, nothing was able to fix these people's lives.   There's a bit more to consider here. First, the odds that an attempted suicide will result in actually dying are low (~4%), so of course someone who died by suicide is unlikely to have nailed it from the first try. However, we're only considering the pool of dead cases here, which radically differs from the pool of living ones. Another factor is that attempting once leads to increased risk of attempting again. Still, keep in mind that only around 30% of those who attempted suicide did it again, and out of those, only 10% eventually died, so even after an attempt, it's still very possible to get better. Of course, not attempting at all is statistically much better."
SuicideWatch,3e154w,MrsFinger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:51:16 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but the fact that 80% of successful ones are not first attempts is kind of saddening.

Badly enough I had to have surgery and still have issues with movement in my wrist. It has been over 10 years now and I have not had those thoughts in 8 years. The scar on my wrist reminds me that I have been to a dark place many times before and that life is ever changing.  I figured my life was pretty miserable back where I grew up, so I took off and moved. I figured I could be miserable anywhere but there was a chance that I could be happy.  I am so glad I decided to change something because I am actually happy now, I have had plenty to be depressed about since then. I have never been that down again. My family was one of my major problems and I needed to separate myself from them to be able to have a healthly life. I know not everyone can just leave and start over.

SuicideWatch,3e1tcq,fuckitalldonedonedon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:28:45 2015 UTC,"Hey-- I know that struggle with the depression. That hole so deep you can't climb out of it. The fact that parts of the real world suck is indisputable. But. Hear me out, here. You say it's because of an SO, that you have a history with depression, and that you have a plan (to get the gun). Those concrete things (a reason, a history, a plan) are enough that if you went to a hospital right now they would admit you. What if you just went, this one insane act of bravery, what if you went and simply heard them out? What if there was even a slim chance that there is something out there you haven't tried for your depression? Isn't it worth finding out? If there really isn't anything, then you can come back here in 48 hours and tell me I'm totally full of shit. Will you take the 48 hours?  I tried at 19. I'm 40 now, and it turned out what I needed was CBT along with new medication. Maybe there's something out there that could get you to 40, too. Get back to me and let me know what happens? I'm out here and I wish you peace and healing."
SuicideWatch,3e1tcq,EddieBurrito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"It's not really because of the SO, But it just adds onto it. I've been struggling with depression since middleschool and my family didn't see the signs when it could have been fixed and treated.  And yes i know, If i even said I thought about retrieving the gun I would be admitted. But I've tried therapy, I've tried meds, Lots of them. None of it helps.  I get better for a week at tops and then just end up falling further down."
SuicideWatch,3e1tcq,frail_kingdom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"I hope I am not too late but I would like to share my experience with you.  I am a recovering suicide victim, and I COMPLETELY understand the ""why me?"" mentality.  I think mostly everyone in this subreddit does... but you know what?  After surviving my attempt, and making it through it all.... I ask myself the same question even more! Why am I still here when I did not even want to be? I am 30 years old and want to assure you that there is LOTS of time left in your life to experience many things, good, bad, small, big, happy, sad.  Nothing hurts more than a loss of a loved one, they mean the world to us... but I can tell you with 100% confidence that you can make a better future for yourself by just making small goals for yourself everyday, because the bigger ones will always be out of reach.  I never found the end of the hole but I can tell you the love that is within you to care so deeply about another person will reach an individual who will need it, appreciate it, and value it.  I always say that time does not heal all wounds but it will definitely give you more perspective, which is HUGE.  Take a break from women, reflect on what YOU want in the world.  If you feel you do not want anything and just want to end it all I can safely say you really have not taken the time to do that much sincere introspect and you owe it to yourself to do so.  Make a game plan, it can be as simple as ""I am going to ride a bike today"", anything... feel free to send that plan to me and we will try to figure out how you can make that happen for yourself.  You are searching for something to fill your void but instead of trying to fill it right now, just leave it alone, you can pick that baggage back up at any time.  If you were still together with your SO, what did you want to do long term?  Try and do those things for yourself! Maybe you will realize it wasn't even what you actually wanted you know?  I volunteer at multiple hospitals here, I figured I cannot be happy myself... but that does not mean I cannot make others happy because I know I can be a caring person (which by reading your message I know you are too).  I am not saying this will work for you but understand I don't think my actions are selfish anymore in the least and I owe it all to time and perspective and just generally growing through adulthood."

I'm here if you want someone to talk to. Peace."

I was engaged to a beautiful girl and then was diagnosed with cancer.  She cheated on me with my best friend and they just recently got married.    I completely understand how you feel.  When people we love act like it was nothing at all, it can destroy our world.  I wouldn't wish that pain on my worst enemy.   I want to tell you a couple of things that I wish someone had told me when this first started.    You are not pathetic.  This happens to the best of us.  Some relationships don't work out.  She made that decision, not you.  You cannot allow her to destroy yourself.    Do you want the honest truth?  At this point, she doesn't care.  She didn't love you as much as she made you believe.  Thats ok.  Us guys fall hard when we do fall.     You experienced something that many on here never get the chance to experience.  Do you know how many guys would kill to have a relationship of what you felt for just one day?    Dude, you are not pathetic.  You are amazing in the fact that you were able to overcome the lies of Christianity, and simply become a better person because you want to be, and not because there is some eternal punishment.    You are incredibly strong, independent, and free thinking.  You are exactly what women are looking for.    Sometimes though, if we want something too much, it ends up being a disappointment.  Don't worry about this girl.  You found two people so far that you thought were amazing?!?!   Damn man, many guys would love to trade shoes with you.    You got this man!  We are rooting for you every way possible!  Another one will come along, put yourself out there, be social, you will be fine!"

SuicideWatch,3e1eey,Spasmoganabulator,2,Tue Jul 21 05:56:16 2015 UTC,All of this.
SuicideWatch,3e1eey,Spasmoganabulator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:57:41 2015 UTC,"I understand you're frustrated, but now there's so many more possibilities opening up for you. I think you could focus on developing healthy sexuality and social skills so that the connections you do make are safe and confident. Coming out of an indoctrination is no small task along with handling the urges you've spent so long resisting or carrying guilt for. There's a lot of support to find on Reddit.   I was wondering is your desire to have a girlfriend more based on sexual impulses or wanting to build a connection with someone? Building lasting friendships can be more beneficial in the long run than a shorter term girlfriend, but you definitely could try online dating. The best way to find a girlfriend is to focus on something you enjoy that you could meet folks while doing.  As a side note, I had a close friend who was raised extremely religious and didn't leave until after college. Most of his exposure to sexuality was either him telling himself it was evil (he actually worked up a lot of resentments about women he found attractive from the repression) or from pornography, which shows only a caricature of human sexuality. It severely damaged his relationships because he was very judgmental and demanding and expected his sex life to be like porn. It's a pretty constant pile of self inspection but he's made a lot of progress in his sexuality, but not until after it cost him his long-term girlfriend. You're all but certainly going to be able to meet folks to date and connect with, and maybe you'd benefit from seeing a good therapist and talking to knowledgeable, positive folks about healthy relationships and your history. It takes a really special kind of person to go through the radical changes you have and I'm sure you'll be developing as a person even more as you go along and that'll make you an even better partner."
SuicideWatch,3e1eey,Spasmoganabulator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:42 2015 UTC,"Building a genuine connection, or just sex?  I have no preference at this point. I am absolutely up for either. I just want a female to show me attention.  I have been online dating and talking to girls non-stop since I was 17. If I had to estimate, have talked minimum to 150 women globally over the years. two of the three dates this year were matches online.  I go out to play Magic: the Gathering all the time. 3 years now. I regularly ask my peers if they know of any leads.   So, I am trying.  edit- oh also, ""knowledgable folks"" is gonna exclude my family because... for previously stated stuff. :/"
SuicideWatch,3e1eey,craigslisttrash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:36 2015 UTC,"That's good that you've been looking into online dating. I actually met a few friends through OK cupid. Tinder was terrible though, there was no way to know what I might have in common with them. If you enjoy magic the gathering that's great, but it's a pretty cloistered and sedentary activity. Just getting out in nature can be awesome for your mind and mood. Are you intimated by going on dates with women or does that seem to come pretty naturally? It sounds like if you've talked with that many that you're doing pretty well."
SuicideWatch,3e1eey,Hugh_Wotmate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'm pathetic.   I disagree. You sound very normal to me.   It kills me that the person who made me happier than anyone ever wants nothing to do with me.   Again, normal. I feel you, brother. We've all been there. Well, no, all of us who are lucky, have been there. Some have never even tasted the highs! I consider myself lucky to have experienced those highs you describe, and the lows you mention too, several times (I'm older than you are).  The good news is, this crap gets easier! The more you do it the more scar tissue you build up. And guess what else? As time goes on you meet girls you're not totally into, but who are into YOU, and you end up the one who breaks their hearts. It is all part of the natural cycle of life. Beautiful and painful at the same time.   Since then I have one-time dated 3 girls. All 3 this year alone. All rejected me.   I hear you. I've one-time dated seven this year alone. But guess what? Because I kept going I also many-times dates some other ones. :)  In the end if you keep going you can find someone with whom you mesh. KEEP GOING! I for one have got your back."
SuicideWatch,3e1mga,mynewburnaway,2,Tue Jul 21 06:56:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to make a lot of assumptions in this comment, so keep that in mind. I've been in the position you're in, as a teenager I was hospitalized/sent to 6 month residential facilities for suicide attempts. When you're in the moment, nothing matters. You feel like you know life won't get any better, because all of the bullshit you've had to deal with is enough to make you think the universe is just basely against you. Suicidal thoughts are strange because once you breach the line where you think ""maybe killing myself is a good option"", it becomes the solution to any problem you have. The lesson I took from my experiences is that when those self harm impulses are incredibly strong, you are not being you. You're suffering from an illness, and while I can't tell you exactly what to do to fix it, I want you to be aware that it is just that, an illness. Like I said, I've been in your position, killing yourself seems like a very attractive option when you're at the low points of your life. And I don't mean to say the corny platitude bullshit that ""life gets better"". I'm not recommending that you just ""man up"" or anything like that, but the best thing you can do for yourself is to pay more attention to your emotions. Think about why you feel the way you do, and even if your situation is ""hopeless"", try to entertain ideas for things that would make you happy. You don't have to jump up and go back to school or learn an instrument immediately, just like someone with orthopedic injuries doesn't need to immediately start running. The first step to recovery/happiness is a very small one, just try to imagine the type of life you want to live. You don't have to start sprinting after it, take baby steps towards it. Suicide is a last resort when life is just impossibly difficult, but when you look at the statistics about it, you can see that many people choose that path despite them having a legitimate chance to be happy. Nobody has 0% chance of eventually being happy, but you concretely decide that you will never be happy again when you kill yourself. And while that idea might seem very similar to the ""just pretend to be happy"" bullshit that ""normal"" people spew, it really is the only way to get better. Nobody wants to kill themselves, its just a last resort when it seems like all other options are exhausted. The flaw in that line of thinking is that no matter who you are in this world, you do have a chance of eventually being happy/living the life you want to live."

And I was able to gather a bit more than that from your posts but I understand, there's a lot of well meaning but relatively shallow interactions on the internet it's understandable to perceive this as one.    You received gold for telling someone to wake up and tell someone that they loved them. It's really not said enough. And that you're interested in human sexuality, etc etc. I scanned pretty far back. Personality types can be fairly interesting as well.   When the walls closed in I always just moved or made another drastic change.

He knows how much I've struggled, and how miserable I am. I don't think people understand what it's like to have lived my ""life"". I am completely alone. I have never gone to a concert with a girl, asked a girl out (and been accepted, I mean :P ) I've never gone camping with friends, I would have loved that. I've never felt passion, I've never felt loved, I've never felt that magic, that chemistry you get when you meet someone really special, and they feel the same way about you. I've never gone on a date, or... I could go on, but basically, I have never shared my life with anyone. I have never experienced life with anyone. I do everything alone, it's like I am the only man on earth. Even when there are people there, they don't talk to me. I just can't interact, that's what autism has done, it creates this disconnect, this bubble, between me and everyone else. I will be truly alone for the rest of my life. I will never feel the touch of a human being ever again, for as long as I live. I'll never share a laugh with someone, or share a meal, or just hang out. Every day on facebook and other sites I see people with their friends and partners, happy. People my age are having kids, falling in love, buying houses together, getting married, or just having fun.

P.S: I would personally really not want to live by deceiving myself that something is funny, wasting time by faking laughs on it along with thinking it's fine. I do really feel bad even after I had a laugh with someone on some bullshit which is commonly discussed in a mediocre society... making me also want to slap myself.  I'd be relieved to live a life in which only rational emotion happen to me, such as mere love, satisfaction for my achievements, curiosity or either just total rational seriousness, evolving discipline.  Anyway I'd really think life could become easier whether everyone become reasonable, helping each other along with our world's progress.

It takes a while, but eventually he feel better and leaves the bathroom, only to have it happen again the next day. It gets so bad, he worries he might even die. He would see a doctor, but he can't afford one. However, he knows his friends and family could have medicine, but he'd rather not have them worry, so he takes the pain, every...single...day. What do you think of this person?  I think he's a person that's extremely considerate and caring, but to the point of self-destruction. Make this person's illness depression and it's unfortunately what millions of people do everyday. If you were poisoned, would you not call the hospital because you wouldn't want to burden them?  I know you're a nice guy because part of what makes life tiring for you is how you live for others.   I still feel like life is this giant burden that I bear so I don't hurt those around me. It is really tiring living for the sake of others.   But it's to the point where it's working against you. What if one of your friends committed suicide and in their suicide note they wrote that they didn't want to burden you with their emotions and didn't tell you of their problem because of it? I think it's great that you were able to open up here. If you open to people you have closer relationships with, it could help you even more. When I first opened up to my friend, she put in more effort in taking care of me than I ever expected. It was all genuine and she really did change my life.   If you don't know anyone you want to open up to, that's fine. You don't have to open up to anyone you don't want to. My parents didn't know until I asked them to take me to a therapist. The reason you don't want to open up shouldn't be because you're worried about burdening them. You're putting a bigger burden on yourself."

This simple realization took much sadness off of myself, because I realized if I could, I would cure that child from cancer, etc. But I can't. Acknowledging the fact that we, as humans, are not as powerful as we'd sometimes like to admit was a huge weight off of my chest.  However, repeating phrases to myself is just the conscious mind talking to itself, it doesn't make a deep change. For myself, it was chi kung exercises; learning to breathe coupled with meditation.

The best would have been to Study at least eight hours a day from 08AM, Eating or taking care of projects from 4PM until 6PM, going to gym until 9/10PM, going to sleep until 01/02AM, working as baker until 08AM and so on.  Nothing.... Just mere depression chains and hypersomnia.  I regret being born from at least when I was six or eight years old, there's absolutely no news for me about that.  P.S: I could always graduate myself by studying as an autodidacticist at home and then just try to result the final exams as a ""privatist"", even though how much useless in this country it has become, having also to pay 300€ if I didn't pay for useless and expensive paper books by going to school as our filthy institutions ask.  That's just bullshit."

I'm more for a Polymath way of working or either learning, being a person able to fastly learn along with learning as many jobs as is wanted.  For example I don't see a single reason for which there should be hired ten cleaning employee, ten business men and twelve coworkers, when just the twelve coworkers, either just employees, can manage to do every job as for what cleaning and business concern.  I'm more for a Übermensch society like, rather than what nowadays keeps underestimating everyone.  P.S: Piece of papers won't ever make a difference, facts and proofs do it.  It is also because of how much experience is requested, at least here, having become the myth of searching for ""Experienced apprentice"" what searching for a job means here. Learning at public schools and earning even an university degree doesn't help as well, considering how many people are unemployed, still living at their parents base at fifty years old; Considering how much of a mechanical ""notionism"" has the same society of studies become, in which the same student aren't qualified or either serious people, not to talk about how much decaying are the same representative teachers or either institutions.  Autodidacticism would prove society's maturity nowadays, considering how much easy is to just remember a text, then repearing it, pass the exam and being a failure at work.

Now we have that out of the way, go tell her how you feel bro.  Couple things can happen, she says yes she likes you too and you guys start a relationship.  She says no and you say it's cool let's just be friends and she agrees.  She says no and start distancing herself from you.  The last possibility seems like the reason against opening your feelings to her, therefore it is up to you to weight the potential gain and loss.  Personally I would go for it because I rather have her tell me no and move on then to wonder about what ifs every night.  Here is another thing that will be hard for you to believe or see because you are the main character in your story, she won't be the only girl you will fall for and there will be others after her.  There is no promise that she saying yes to you will lead to a happily ever after ending.  See the results and prepared yourself for the fallout mentally, hope for the best prepare for the worse.  If you are in a mentally weak state of mind, then don't do anything that will trigger depression or sadness.

She also told me she wants to invite me for a movie night but im not sure if I should take her up on the offer. I'll probably tell her she should only contact me again when she figured out what she wants regarding our friendship.

SuicideWatch,3dznts,Unchainedboar,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:28 2015 UTC,"Hi Adam, thank you for sharing. Could you make a list, in order, of what would improve life and the way you feel? So maybe something like: 1. Move in with Mum. Let her know it's temporary so we've both got a date to work with.  2. Find a job doing something that suits me for now, and use the time spent with Mum saving for a rental deposit. 3. Rent my own place. 4. Get a dog. 5. Go for long walks with my lovely dog during my free time. 6. When things have settled down into a routine, join a therapy group to meet others like me and help me love myself more.  From there, you may have the confidence to turn a job that pays into a job that you love, once the wheels are in motion. Basically, start at the basic needs and then everything on from that can be more tailored.  Ari went to a lovely family and will always know how much she was loved then, and is now. You could spend your time now looking up breeds or information on your next dog, which is a positive aspiration to work to.  Please make a plan other than ending it. It's just so final and maybe, like me, in 10-years'-time, you'll subscribe to this subReddit to help others, rather than to post. I used to think I'd end up in a mental facility or in an early grave and, although I'm not cured of all my problems, the older I get, the more I am able to work on them, and now it's really starting to become clearer, what I need to do to feel happier in my own skin. I didn't used to have hope and the beginning - without hope - is a slog, but slowly but surely, with the help of long walks with your new dog, you might start to realise you're feeling more optimistic about the future. Also, this time moving back, maybe use this time with your mum to confide in her and make a friend out of her? She maybe doesn't know how you're feeling and could help?  You certainly don't seem unlikeable. Good luck and please, before you do anything else, write an achievable 'now' list of where you can go from here (that's positive). Once you've ticked that off, in a year or two, write another list, and it'll be more exciting, as your basic needs from the first list will be met, then another, then another, and one day, your list might compromise of things that seem like only pipe-dreams now. Baby steps, but in the right direction. Good luck."

You don't know what those good times and tears of joy will be over, but they do lay ahead, and the struggles now will never be this hard again because you'll be stronger mentally after dealing with all this shit. Good things lay ahead - stick around and find out what they are (and aid them a bit by believing in yourself enough to get the ball rolling). You can do it, Adam, and you only need to surprise yourself the once ('oh wow, I've just realised I'm curled up on my own sofa with my dog, watching my favourite film and enjoying it!') and then that's it, you'll know you can and have come out of this. From then on, your confidence will slowly grow as you keep taking these small steps in the right direction, and then one day in the future, something will happen that would send you to pieces now, but it won't for future-Adam, because past-Adam made him stronger by moving forward in spite of such low feelings.

SuicideWatch,3dznts,Reitsukai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:02:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, my name is Adam too. Seems like you need to talk. It's normal to need someone who cares about you when it feels like no one ever has, it's the same for me, even for the high school part. It's hard to live with it, but you shouldn't focus on it. Since you're 23 and moved in and out a lot of times, it's normal if she doesn't welcome you with open arms, maybe she wants you to be independent. Do you have any hobby? something to hold on to? When I was really depressed, I just kept on drawing and drawing, and now I'm never depressed, I always look on the bright side of life. I don't know what happened, I guess I just tried to enjoy every single moment of joy/happiness. You said that you were unlikable, well you don't seem to be, maybe you need to work on that? If you want people to care about you, you need to make them want to care about you, just by being lovely. I know it sounds crazy and odd, like why the hell is that guy I don't know trying to change the way I am when he doesn't know me, I know. If you want to receive, you need to give. Try to be a better version of yourself, just try, even if you don't want to try anymore. It's the best and only thing you can do. But talk, don't keep your thoughts for yourself."

Sometimes people give up and do end up killing themselves. But you know what those people thought before they went through with it? That they didn't want to die yet. Death is not your only way out. Life isn't permanent and things change. Life doesn't stop, and eventually, as cliché as it may sound, there is a 'light' at the end of the tunnel. You must get through shitty things before your life can become somewhat decent again, and sometimes life won't always seem worth living, but you need to wade through all the bad shit in it. Please remember that there are people that care about you, and I am one of them. Even if I'm a complete and utter stranger. Please don't listen to those people who just tell you to get over it. They're wrong. Please try to continue to look for help from a counselor/therapist. See your doctor. And if you still are having suicidal thoughts, go to your local hospital, and get help.

Brother, sister, etc. I understand that you're getting kicked out, so I can presume that your relationship with your parents is a bit iffy.   If money is an issue, and you can't seek out therapy/counseling, then maybe you should call a hotline and talk to them whenever you feel suicidal or lonely, or however. I know that sometimes they may be shitty, but there's also some really great and helpful people working them.

SuicideWatch,3dz4ek,KnockMellyKnock,4,Mon Jul 20 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"Two things.   First, nothing you write is stupid. It took time and you were able to put words down to convey something. So don't feel ashamed of what you write, some people (me included) struggle with that ability.   Secondly, I'm sure your husband doesn't mind being there for you to lean on. Maybe some days it doesn't show as much as it should. In the grand scheme of things I bet he would rather have you there with him sharing your feelings as opposed to being left alone.

Writing things down can often be a great way to calm down when depressed, even if its not for anybody to read. It helped me a lot anyway. You're not worthless, you said you have a husband and you can see how it affects him. It affects him because he cares about you, I'm sure he thinks you are from worthless, and that's incredibly special. If you want to help him, then make sure you use him to lean on. As a guy I can only assume that he is like me in the sense that he will feel really good by being there as a support and being allowed to absorb any of your problems. It wont make you better, but it might help to be as open as you can be. Don't see it as burdening him because all he wants to do is help you, if anything it will make him feel more like he has a purpose.  Ive been there with depression and it feels horrible, it never feels like there is a way out. I pushed people away by not wanting to burden anybody, but inside all I wanted was everybody to pull down my barriers and just sit with me. Just being by me and sitting with me so that I could feel I wasn't alone. So let him in and use his support, there is a way out and there is an end. It never goes away fully, I've been out for 4 years now but there are always days that get you. But if you have somebody there then us him and you will pull through it together."

I think that the hardest bit is that she doesn't seem emotionally stable enough to cope with being alone while she gets over you. So by staying in contact with her she will never see that as being just friends. That will only end in breaking her even more. There needs to be a way of completely distancing yourself, but so that she has somebody to care for her (by the sounds of things she needs caring/watching 24/7 at the moment). Does she have anybody else? Friends or family? I know what its like to have depression and to have a long term relationship end (7 years from being 15), so I can empaphise with with both of you. If there is anybody else that can help her then if they can be with her the best thing to do would be let her go cold-turkey."

Until the friends enjoying my company don't feel artificial when they say ""I missed you"" or something. I guess my point is, as hard as it may be: get out there and see some friends. Talk to people you haven't talked to in a good while. Sometimes they won't contact you because THEY think YOU don't want to contact THEM. Suicide may sound like a good idea but it never really is.

I feel where you are coming from, and I want you to know that I sympathize with you. But you know what, I'm gonna keep going on. Because I'm almost old enough to take control of my life and become and adult, and I know there are others out there like me -- like you -- and if I meet them I'll be able to connect and form genuine human relationships with them. That's what I crave. I'm lonely and scared and tired but I don't wanna give up. Giving up won't fix what I'm feeling. However, I think that if I hold out, time will bring what I really need. And if it doesn't, well, I'll just enjoy the little things every now and then -- like my pet lizard, the occasional tv series that i get really into, things like that....and i'll enjoy them as much as i can until I die of old age. Because when I think about it.... I can be dead for eternity but I've only got so much time alive, so I figure I'll use it as best I can while I got it. I'd really like to talk to you some more since you seem like someone I can relate to and have meaningful discussions with.....You know I'm screwed up if I'm trying to make friends with someone halfway across the globe over reddit.....but for my sake please consider it -- I'm pretty lonely....  I think we can help each other.....for both our sakes.  Thanks,  Ace"

SuicideWatch,3dxfhh,The_Great_Daksby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:37:04 2015 UTC,"Was he brought there against his will? Where do you think he's going to go after he's in the hospital? If he sent it to you, I guess it's reasonable to assume he wanted to be stopped, otherwise he wouldn't have sent it. Which changes things significantly. He must have known how you would react to that message, and if he deliberately sent it to you, he may have actually wanted you to intervene.   I'm not a terrible person, but I understand the pain of life, and forcing someone to live is, or should I say, can be, absolutely horrible. I don't know this person at all, I don't know his issues. Maybe he can overcome them. But maybe he can't, maybe he is living though terrible pain and you just took away his way out.  I just find it fundamentally arrogant and reprehensible when someone plays god and decides to exert control over another human beings choices, that's all.   One of my greatest fears is that someone will do that to me, when the time comes, and end up in some psych unit with my freedom violated, treated like a prisoner. Forced to take drugs I don't want, facing abusive or apathetic staff... I narrowly avoided it once before,  I only managed to get out of it because I was a minor and my parents were able to negotiate on my behalf. I was brought there for outpatient treatment instead, and put on a powerful antipyschotic against my will, which I ever should have been given. They never told me or anyone else about the side effects, I could barely stand, I remember being in school struggling to stay conscious, it was terrifying. I started to get tardive dyskinesia, uncontrollable shaking in my fingers. It was mild, but I didn't know what it was, noone told me. Noone cared.  They don't care. In those places, they aren't ""trying to help"" they are not ""safe places to hear"" they do not care.  Ok I am clearly projecting my own issues onto this situation, and I'm sorry, I just really feel for this guy, I mean... I'm so afraid for what's going to happen to him... I don't know where he lives, the psych system here is horrifically bad, I hope he is living somewhere where it's better, but even so.  If someone genuinely wants to die, you can't force them to live, no matter how much you care about them."

SuicideWatch,3dxwtw,m_bertie,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"Hi, melatonin is a hormone that regulates your body clock. It doesn't act like a sleeping pill that initiates sleep, it helps your body know when it should sleep. I don't know your situation, but I would guess that this isn't a deficiency of melatonin because you seem to be going through a big emotional event. But it might be worth talking to a doctor because it can be tested. I'm not sure about addiction, but as it regulates your body clock it's best if you take between 0.5mg and 1.0mg a couple of hours before you go to bed, and I would not recommend using it as a supplement like that for more than a few months.  I just had my heart broken by my fiance who left me, so from what I can gather I understand what you're going through.  If you want to talk about anything then please just send a message to me and I'll happily listen and help in anyway I can."

It seems you've been bullied for the majority of your life, even at the home front, and that says more about the people around you than it does about you.   Sometimes when we get told something often enough we begin to believe it.   You seem well articulated and it's their loss not to get to know you better.   You mentioned that you are paranoid that you are a murderer or a violent person. I had the very same problem, but that was mainly due to my OCD, but I mention it, to show you that there can be other causes to these thoughts than for example actually being a murderer in the making.   As my psychiatrist told me: a good person is scared of these thoughts being true, whilst someone evil would not.  So there you have that!   Also who the fuck says ""you're beneath me"" to someone?!  That just confirms they were not even worth the dirt on your shoes!   You have received such a shitty treatment by people, and still reach out.   I would like you to pull through!  So that, at least shows someone, somewhere does care!   Also you THINK you are a horrible person, but that can only be because you've met so many horrible ones. YOU are NOT!"

I'm told being happy is an exercise and takes training and so on, but that can seem exhausting when one is depressed.   What helped me through a tough time was a book where a psychiatrist describes his conversations with dalai lama, it's called ""The Art of Happiness"".   LINK: http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Art-Happiness-Handbook-Living/dp/0340750154  It may seem cheesy, but it helped me a lot. Maybe if you have the time and energy to read it, you could find some solace in it.   I'm not a religious person, but it is interesting to note that those buddhist monks are always so happy.. Just always thought there had to be a reason for that :)   Also don't be sorry about that.   I genuinely hope you feel better in the future."

Heh, one of the reasons I went on a traid against feminism was because the girl I had a crush on for the longest time that I finally came out too was a feminist and she manipulated my only friend I ever had and several of his friends that I was trying to steal her from him.  You see I confided to my friend that I liked her like a year before this happened and they weren't going out. I had no idea she was going out with him when I told her and he found out and she must have worded it in a way that made me look bad because next thing I knew I was beaten half to death by him and a few of his friends, she was there as well.  There was also another instance where an internet friend of mine who was going to college was accused of rape, and was forced out of college. This is why there's alot of lawsuit now due to the lack of due process for these cases, mostly started by radical feminists.  I realize though logically that not all feminists are like this and most are good people, but when you see women wearing shirts that say ""I bathe in male tears"" it makes me wanna grab a razor blade and slit my veins in the woods somewhere just so I leave this fucked up world.  But hey, I'm still sticking around I guess. :)  My point is, don't do anything crazy when you feel like this.

SuicideWatch,3dxk8a,mater711421,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:46:13 2015 UTC,"Take it from someone who lost his best friend to suicide, and as someone who lost many friends in the past from various other deaths: ""6-12 months to get over me"" is a huge misunderstanding. Suicide in particular isn't like other deaths. Your loved ones will constantly cycle through phases where they blame each other, and then other phases where they blame themselves. Years down the line, they might eventually be able to live normal lives again, but the pain of losing someone in that way never truly goes away the way it does with other deaths, because you are left wondering what could have been, or what if they had just tried something else. You wake up from pleasant dreams where the person is still alive, and then sink into depression knowing that isn't reality. You see little things everywhere that remind you of the person, and you can never truly get rid of every reminder. You question every sign, every signal, and it affects not only how you cherish the memories of that person when they were alive, but also the interactions you have with others. You will always be on edge. This is why I frequent this sub, because I want as few people as possible to feel like there is no one who cares, I want as few people as possible to feel like there's no hope, and I want as few people as possible to lose someone the way I have.   Now, all that being said, I don't want you to feel like you have this pressure to stay alive for others, because that won't really help your scenario. I noticed a few things I'd like to touch up on, if you're willing to talk more:    You mentioned a fear of having no ambition. Do you currently have any passions, things you really enjoy and could see yourself expanding into other capacities? You mention you believe your condition will be curable through therapy and medication, but you have an issue with it and can't do it. What is the issue you have with it? As an outsider, who doesn't know your situation, my first question is: if you're desperate enough to be willing to die to escape the pain, why not try this first just to see how it goes? This is not to invalidate the issues you have with these things, I just want to hear more about your thought process."
SuicideWatch,3dxk8a,didroy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:02:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, you have a very similar case to mine! I also have Sever social anxiety and Aspergers, as well as, obviously severe depression. I also have a very strong aversion to treatment and particularly medication.  A couple of things.  First of all, you're right, your future is in jeopardy. Aspergers is not a gift, it's not a different way of thinking, it's a deficiency, it's a disorder, and it's a bad one. However. If you are 18, or even younger, you have the time to deal with it. I only started fighting this beast when I was about 25, and by then it was far too late, I was too old to get a handle on it. Most of my peer group had moved so far ahead with relationships and jobs that I could never catch up.  However, at 18 you have what I don't have. You have time. You've got years to work on your social skills and job prospects. I would focus on deciding exactly what you want from life, prepare a solid, bulletproof plan for what exactly you want, and then begin immediately. I would start with the social anxiety, that's by far the most treatable of the two conditions, and that will unlock other opportunities. My Anxiety cost me many, many opportunities before by Aspergers ever got involved. With Aspergers, you are going to have to work much harder to find a partner and a job. You may get turned down 10 times more by potential partners, or by employers, so you need to work 10 times harder. Overcoming anxiety will get you out there so that you can interact with the world. Once you do that, you will hopefully end up with some kind of employment and some friends. It will always be tough, but you can end up with a bearable life if you work hard enough early enough."

You need to do the same, or they're going to get worse and worse, and they may end up doing something bad.  If you absolutely 100% cannot have them not work, then the only thing you can do is be /there/. Support them, and try to comfort them. If they need space, give it to them.   I'd suggest hiding anything in your residence that may be harmful to them, including knives, etc. Try to encourage them to stop drinking as well.  If you can't call for help to a hospital, etc, try to convince them to go see a therapist or just their doctor in general.

SuicideWatch,3dwmt0,OxygenTransformed,4,Mon Jul 20 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Hey there.  So first of all. No matter how off or perfectly sane your mom is, parents not getting their kids' hobbies is pretty common. But I get that it's a little more than that with you. But Ive been there.  And really, a little bit of simple confrontation can help with that. Her child or not, you're both adults. Just talk it out. Be as reasonable as you can. Im sure she had hobbies that her parents scoffed at to at one point.  As far as the weed goes. Nothing really wrong with it. Even if that is your one hobby. But if you're at the point where you rely on it so heavily that you'll be a wreck coming off of it, then it might not really be a terrible thing to get off it for a bit but could go either way, really good OR badly.   Either way yeah, it'll probably be scary as hell and uncomfortable. But sometimes we need that to push ourselves to make changes. I just hope the change you choose isn't ending your life.  I dont know the details of your relationship between you and her so I cant say much but dont you maybe think that trying to work on fixing things with her might be a small but important step to getting you back on your feet? Trying to get her to understand and accept you a little better, but at the same time doing the same for her?    If you're comfortable sharing some of these hobbies you are or were interested in or maybe some of hers we might be able to help you out a little more with giving you advice on that. But if not I understand."
SuicideWatch,3dwmt0,Katsami,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know mothers who are over-involved, yet semi-oblivious to their kid's wishes aren't exactly uncommon. The issue with her (I think--I'm obviously no psychologist, so an actual professional might have a different opinion) is that she is way too invested in me as a reflection of her self-worth. I honestly think she thinks I'm the best thing she ever made, and if she isn't constantly hovering over me trying to fix problems that don't exist she isn't being a mother that's worthy of me. What kills me about this (metaphorically of course) is that before I was born, she used to be a brilliant artist and poet. I'm not just saying that because she's my mom and I love her, I've seen some of her work from when she was younger and it is really breathtaking. It just seems like she dropped all that to take care of me when I was born, and instead of ever getting back into it she kind of made me her hobby instead.  Re: the pot: yeah, I know if I'm that dependent on it I probably need a break anyway. I know a lot of things, logically. It doesn't really come out in this post, but I'm an intelligent, educated person who should really know better than this. The issue is that the non-logical half of my brain doesn't listen to the other half, as I'm sure you understand.  I used to like writing, I guess. I kinda stopped liking things around high school (since I would never be allowed to indulge in them without my mom looming overhead) and never really got it back. The stuff I write these days, when I manage at all, isn't really the sort of thing I'd want my mom to know about, though."
SuicideWatch,3dwmt0,Katsami,2,Mon Jul 20 11:49:00 2015 UTC,"And as far as the ""nobody wants to hang around with a crazy person who needs prescribed meds just to not feel suicidal"" kinda made me wanna smack you. :P  Try your best not to think of it like that man, even if everyone around you does. There's so many people out there that are going through something similar as you in their head, including myself. And tons of people you've been around no doubt. A lot of times depression without a specific trigger is just a plain sickness. Manage it, don't make it worse with all the negative stuff. Just think of it like your mind's immune system being down and you need to stay as germ free as you can. The germs being negativity, self doubt, etc.   On days that I think Im just done and tapping out. If I can convince myself to watch something just plain hilarious like standup or learn about something that absolutely blows my mind, I feel better. It helps me either laugh everything off or just think about how little the soap opera that my life is matters, and let's me take it a little less seriously.  But that's just my way of doing it. You're you. Look around  Find those amazing things that make your mind work or find those guilty pleasure that make you giggle like a schoolgirl."

Call a hotline if you have to. They are really understanding, and not the least bit judgmental. Please try to find something to hold on to. Something that you want to stay here for.

I mean if they were indifferent or annoyed by you sharing this with them, you'd never get a response like that.  As someone who has not only constantly been in and out of your shoes, but has also had a close friend go through with suicide after trying to talk to me about it. After I told him something really similar to what your friend told you. I can confirm that it is one of the absolute worst feelings in the world to lose someone like that.   I dont know all of what you're going through, and I doubt your friends completely understand either, but that's not their fault and it isn't yours either. Shit just happens and a lot of times we can't really translate into words what's going on in our own minds, let alone someone else's.  I think you really need to take time and weigh the two things together. Your need to get away from it all, or the feeling that your friends would have when all that's on their mind is ""Why didn't I do more?""

Ask about the person's day, make small talk find similar interests etc.  When you feel like talking to the person, give him/ her a simple text. And good friendships don't have to be maintained regularly too. Don't give up hope on going up the career ladder!

Your life doesn't have to be bad in order to be depresse. Depression isn't just a case of being tired of set-back after set-back in your life, it's is an chemical imbalance in the brain that throws you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, which is why it's so hard to kick it by just ""being positive"".   From my own experiences, the hardest hurdle to get over is realizing that it's not you're fault, being depressed doesn't make you a bad person, and it's no more your fault then it's a sick person's fault for having caught a virus. For years I felt ashamed, like I had no right to feel this way, afraid of what other people might think. There's always going to be people out there who support you and would want to help you in any way they could. If and when you reach out for help, of course there's going to be some people who just don't understand, but you don't have to feel this way for the rest of your life. The medical field now understands depression better then they ever have before and the treatment methods are getting better all the time."
SuicideWatch,3dwebg,Helios337,2,Mon Jul 20 02:21:40 2015 UTC,"Hello! I hope you're still here.  I'd like to try answering your second question. I'm not sure who you're referencing exactly so I have two answers:  If you're asking why I, a stranger om reddit, care that you're suicidal, it's because you were brave enough to reach out. Posting on r/suicidewatch tells me you don't want to die but also don't know what to do. The good news is just posting here is a good first step! I'm on this subreddit because someone once helped me and in gratitude to them, as well as respect to you, I'd like to help as well. I'm no professional but if you want someone to just listen I would be happy to do that.  If you're asking why you feel guilty for contemplating suicide, it's because inherently you know it isn't solving anything. This is a bold assumption I'm making off my own experience, I apologize if I've put words into your mouth.  Death won't heal your wounds. After all, a corpse can't mend itself.  But a living person can.   I felt guilty because I felt it was a slap to those who cared about me to give up on mending myself.  But most of all I felt guilty to myself, for giving up on my own dreams. I felt guilty for all the past Claudi_Days who'd work so hard to get to that point, even if it was a terribly painful one.   I hope I've answered your question. If you want someone to talk to please feel free to pm me! I do work so I can't always respond right away. But I'll certainly do my best!"

My roommate just got in a car crash a few days ago and rolled his car and he's having trouble walking.   Super scary stuff.   Hope your neck feels better though :)   I'm glad my username made you chuckle lol its an Archer quote.   It took me a really long time to get over my ex,  we broke up, then tried the open relationship ""were hooking up but not dating""  thing and it was a disaster.   It probably would have been wiser to just distance ourselves from the get go,  but I still loved him.     Time was really what healed me and allowed me to get over him.   A friend of mine convinced me to make an Okcupid and start dating again, I dated a bunch of people that ranged from meh to fucking awful, gave up on dating then eventually met someone new.   I don't know, I guess I just kept on moving forward until I didn't think about him anymore.     The reason I keep my eye on this subreddit is actually because after we broke up I never wanted to leave my house.   We had got this windowless loft together and when he moved out it was just depressing.  I stayed inside in the computer all day and figured I could make myself feel better by trying to make other people feel better.   Mostly I think it worked."

Get through the crisis and your ok. 1. Get to work. Ride the bus, train, walk, ride share, does your insurance not pay for a rental? 2. If you have insurance consider asking your physician for an anti-depressant. Some like viibryd are supposed to work quickly. 3. Sleep is important. Figure out how to sleep soundly. 4. Do what you did here. Reach out. Find someone who seems genuine at work or at church or wherever and spill your guts. 4. Move around. Keep occupied. I have suffered several bouts of girlfriend depression. Its usually a more event specific depression and shorter lived than people with full blown biologically based depression."

SuicideWatch,3duar7,Bike_shop_owner,3,Sun Jul 19 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"When I was in the hospital, just being present was enough. It really meant a lot. One thing that bothered me was any indication that the person visiting me didn't seem to understand what I was going through. My grand parents asked ""What are you so depressed about?"" and my uncle seemed to think that my problem was just not sleeping (he wasn't wrong. I hadn't slept in days, but the problem was a lot worse than that). Worst of all was faux understanding. Whenever someone would say ""I understand"" it always just felt forced.   Ask about her and what she needs. Have pleasant conversation, if she seems up for it. Be yourself, and make it known that you care. Honestly, psych-wards are fucking awful. They cram everyone together, alcoholics, suicidal people, drug users they find on the street. Any sort of respite is nice. Your visit will be worth volumes by it's self."
SuicideWatch,3duar7,AmericanParadox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know that this is something you will want to hear, but I was that age when I tried to commit suicide. I took 2 and a half handfuls of Tylenol and, two or three Adderall and I took a few sips of whiskey when I wasn't dying soon enough. I don't think this was a real suicide attempt. I could be wrong, but if she is causing scenes and needing attention, she might just want to wake her parents up so they care about her more. She sounds like she needs someone to care about her. Unless she was taking some hardcore antidepressants, I don't think 25 would be enough to kill someone.  Edit: Just tell her that you're there for her, tell her that you care. You're glad she's okay, and you and your daughter care very much about her. Tell her she can come to you anytime, you don't want her feeling like this anymore. Then ask how the hospital is. Is she going to be 302'd?"

SuicideWatch,3dulmt,ShameRefined,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"I can understand. Many people who never dealt with their problems in life have to face their children who are dealing with the actual world, as opposed to the world that the parents have holed themselves away in (or away from).   So they begin to fight their children, especially if they have never grown up properly themselves.   This was the case for me, because my parents refused to take a look at the world that I was stepping into. I was forced to find the answers myself, and I am glad that I did, because I have a much more complete picture, now.   I understand wanting not to survive this. But I encourage you to do exactly that, to survive. You need to get away from them, which means you must be financially independent. Plan a life away from them, and figure out a life that you can afford.   Do you have emotional issues that would make being employed impossible? I felt like that was me for a while, and I am very thankful to have made it through that point in my life. I believed that my panic attacks were so severe that I could never work again. Thankfully I managed to get through that and life is very different for me now."

Sometimes depression comes I'm like a leech, sucks enjoyment from everything, even things you used to adore. If I knew the magical way out, I probably wouldn't be here. But I do know that there is a way out, what you are feeling right now will not last forever. Death is certain, final and irreversible. Life offers so many more possibilities. If you're anything like me these possibilities may not excite you just now, but every day that you suffer makes you stronger, and when you become strong enough to push this dark cloud off yourself, every breath you take will be more beautiful than the last."

But  What i was trying to explain is that i have seemingly lost all that i felt, i don't feel that sickly pain or happiness etc, its like when its a really cold day and you can't feel your hands, i've grown numb to everything not in a physical sense, but a mental sense.   ""Death is certain"" indeed, that's the beauty of it, its the one Absolute thing coordinating with life that i can count on, that's for a different post at a different time however.  is it normal to feel numb to everything? in my mind i say yes but in my heart i say no."
SuicideWatch,3dvuak,vkat2806,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:50:00 2015 UTC,"I think I felt the same when I was on antidepressants to be honest. Just numb, unaffected. Maybe it's your brains way of coping with the pain, I don't know. And yes, there is beauty and a sort of odd comfort in the certainty of death, but there is also beauty in the uncertainty of life. It's hard to say what is normal but i feel like I can say that nothing is permanent, however you feel right now could be the complete opposite of how you feel in a few months. That's the beauty of life, it isn't quite as predictable as we'd all like it to be, in the best and the worst ways."

I too know what its like to realize the truth, it gives you hope of making things right yet it makes you feel so much worse, knowing that most other people doesnt have to deal with that and that actually you shouldnt have to, it feels so unfair. But there is something you didnt think of and its your merit of noticing and wanting to change things, I'm really proud of that, I hate to say this but when I was your age I still wasnt as aware of my situation as you are.  It sucks that people at your school isnt exactly helping either but making it a lot worse, that happened to me too. It sucks, and its just pathetic that they only do it in groups, they are actually so shitty, but what can one do when 30 fucking people have agreed to pretend you are inferior to them, whatever you do? But let me tell you something: Its not true, thats why they try so hard to make you believe it.  I love programming too :) Its so awesome to be able to 'speak to computers' in a way, instead of just using programs others made, isnt it? And the feel of combining commands as a puzzle to solve a new problem is so priceless. How did you find out about programming, and what languages do you use?  What country are you from, if you dont mind me asking? Maybe its not so bad as you believe. If you are from the european union, you will be able to live and work in any other european country you want.  Look, I legitimately think you are an awesome guy. You may not seem like it right now, I mean, you are depressed and in a very bad position and you even doubt yourself, but that doesnt change the potential you have. You have outgrown your family's lie, you know you dont deserve their shit, and you are planning your future new life already. I think you will not have the shitty life you expect right now but a much more awesome one, after all, life changes a lot, maybe you dont yet know since you are so young, but let me tell you that even if you spend hours planning and foreseeing your future life, it will still be nothing like you imagine :) And I believe you can get what you dream of now."

I have worked since I was 13 as a waiter during summer vacations and made quite a lot of money sometimes but in a family who barely makes $300-400, keeping money for yourself isnt easy. short story ended up giving all my money to help my mother and some part to pay for my sister education.   so basically I am hopeless man stucked in a house  where I am being driven crazy every day. in a house where I feel like I should be the one to keep the peace and tell them what to do like they were little kids and I am the grown up man. I see my friends doing all kind of silly things and then I see myself in the mirror. first time looking , I  see a fat kid who had to grew up far much faster then his friends. he is smart, wise, self-confident and emotionally stronger than anyones he has met. if you could see his soul you would see scares everywhere, scares that represent his suffferings. scares that make him stronger and weaker in the same. and if you see deeper in his eyes you will see just a scared little kid, lying down on the floor in the darkest corner who just keeps crying. he wants his childhood back . he wants back all the time his family and his so called ""friends"" stole him. he wants them to suffer like he suffered, he wants them to die like he died every single day, he wants them to cry like he cried every night before bed. no matter how much I try to keep that little kid locked away it is impossible not to hear him. he is full of hate and anger . he loves no one because all around him he see only monsters. all he wants is to be loved. all he wants is a chance to show the world how tryly amazing he is , a chance to become someone, a chance to live a life thats worth living"

THANKS  @programming I took a class on building websites at school. the class sucked. the only thing the teacher knew how to do was build a website using weebly, a bit of dreamweaver and some basic html and that was it. the only things she knew about css was how to change text and background color. javascript was a big NO since she had no idea. hell she even told use to use tables for navigation bars  one day while I was playing an online game saw a link to a website called codeacademy who taught beginners how to code. curious about coding I went to code academy website  and did their html&css track and also their javascript track. I felt I wasnt learning much so started searching for more lively tutorials. there I came across CS50 and its amazing professor David Malan. His way of teaching got me in love with programming, he basically changed my life. I havent finished it yet (it was impossible for me to take it in the same I was in school) but I intend to finish this summer. Meanwhile I finished MIT 6.00.1x which gave me a very amazing introduction to programming and the beautiful language of python. After that I started taking the Rice university specialization on computing at Coursera which is an wonderful series of courses taught by amazing teachers. took a course c++ in a course center (purely because they offered me to learn there for free) but they only taught us how to create simple command line programs (just branches,loops,functions and some OOP). didnt go in depth with pointers, dynamic allocations and other complex c++ concepts. I taught myself javascript (which is my favourite language) through books and tutorials on youtube and I am going throught FreeCodeCamp tutorials and challenges. my plan is to learn angular and node.js and become a professional javascript dev."

You seem to have the magnifying glass on this one thing -- the fact that you haven't gotten a job yet. You don't have to pretend everything is fine, it's okay to feel this way. This is just another challenge for you. However, just putting yourself down constantly over this one thing is NOT going to help in any way or form. You're focusing too much on the negatives -- you haven't been able to find a job, you're not financially secure yet, and so on. However, in your first sentence there are many positives! You seem to take care of yourself and are in a good position. Sure you may not have a job yet, but that's something you can work on. Others expect a lot from you, but one thing I've learned is that you'll never be able to live up to other's expectations. Even if you do, that does nothing for you. You have to have your own goals in mind first and foremost. The rejection can hurt, and that's okay. It's okay to be hurt by it, but you should not let it get to you so much so that you become depressed by it. Try to work on things rather than get stuck on the negative -- work on your resume (there's plenty of people on reddit that edit resumes), work on your interview skills, work on your presentation skills. Get involved with the process of improvement rather than the process of self-doubt. It can be hard, I know and I understand, but you can and will get past this. Good luck with your job hunt my friend, and best of luck with everything else."

I have been looking for a job myself, and I feel you, the lacks of response, the unexplainable NOs... Its very frustrating and it makes you wonder whats wrong, but remember that every failed application or interview means that you will do it better next time.  You are right when you say that calling yourself rich for having the basics is 'cliche': you should not be contempt with that. But there's no harm in saying that you have people and things that make your life priceless.  Keep looking for a job man as you are doing, just dont give up no matter how many times you get rejected, that is the key to succeeding. There are several other people around in your situation too looking for a job in your field, and if you think that nothing differentiates you from them, which may be true, then being persevering could make the difference. But dont forget that this bullshit doesnt define you.  I'd love to help you beyond just this post of encouragement, I think I could help you rig your resume to get more calls to interviews, by making it more appealing to HR departments and adapting it to the software most large companies use to filter candidates, to at least get calls even if the interview fails, I've been doing it in my industry, just pm me"

Maybe you shouldnt avoid socializing because of that, man.

Know that this breakup and relationship does not define you as a person, as much as you feel right now that it did. It's okay to feel bad after a breakup, everyone does. These feelings are normal, but you must understand that you can overcome them. They will pass. Right now, you're in a vulnerable state, and that too is okay. However, you must try to do all you can to get past this. Try to do things you enjoy, things that can distract you, people you can talk to. If venting on here helps, do that too. You think the breakup was all your fault, but I highly doubt that. It does not make you an asshole for going too quickly, everyone makes these types of mistakes. You've made it this far through many hardships it seems. You sound like a very resilient and strong person. I know how anxiety feels like, I've had it for four years. To go through that for so many years, you're an amazing person in my book. You can and will get past this."

Wait for her to talk to you, don't force it out of her because that can just make things worse and cause tension between the two of you Just be there for her, show her that you care. Listen to her and be patient.

If you ever really think she's in danger, then telling her parents or calling 911 could be in order. In the meantime, take care of yourself, too. You're obviously a great person for helping her.

SuicideWatch,3dubwf,angel_in_black,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:35:41 2015 UTC,"I think one of the most important things you can do is to keep talking about your life and writing about it to people.  I've been in situations where I felt very strong love and depression from the failure of love. I no longer am so bound and destroyed by it, I am my own person now and I no longer feel like it will ever have that hold on me again.  But to overcome that was such a huge wound that I understand that it can be utterly crippling.  One of the best things, I think, is to keep writing and relating to people who feel emotionally similar as you. That's perfect for what reddit is, and I encourage you to keep doing it.. Post on other people's topics as well, relate.  Because when we're stuck in a place like that, what we need to do is feel that there is something else out there, something that will relate to us that isn't just in our minds, because we have yet to really ground out of that place in our minds. We need to learn how to express ourselves and connect to the world at large.  This is something that takes a long time, a very long time. But it's something you get better at, and it feels good to work on it. And working on it will make whatever relationships you have in the future much much much more stable.  You can have love again, but the key is to work on yourself to the point where you no longer need it. That's what makes you strong enough to actually be in a committed relationship. That's what people mean when they say to love yourself first. It means that you develop your own emotional comforting and healing, for me that was primarily through singing and music at first.   Then you keep working on yourself, not for any reward, but because of the feeling of satisfaction and strength you derive from continuing to do so.  Hope that helps, even if only a little. I understand how pointless things may feel, but recovery may not be that far away... I understand the feeling."

My parents don't talk about it, they see I'm not okay but it doesn't matter. They probably think it's nothing and tomorrow I'll be fine. I went out with friends yesterday and drank a lot.

SuicideWatch,3dtcal,garrettsykes,6,Sun Jul 19 06:49:42 2015 UTC,"Hey dude.  Been there before. Actually, I ended up getting cheated on, and I read all of the messages she had been sending. A couple of months before that and before our relationship got rough, she proposed to me.  About the same age as you too.  All I can say is that this is something that a lot of people go through, and experiencing a breakup with somebody so close to you... the feelings that go with it are the reason that sad love songs are as popular as they are.   It blows. It really does. And the worst part is that I can't tell you that it gets better (even though it does), because I know that you'll never believe me - because, let's face it, I wouldn't believe anybody who told me that it gets better for me when I was going through it, too. But let me tell you a little bit about what happens.  Basically, you find other reasons to live for. Instead of love. You ever see that guy or girl at the top of his class who studies all the time and does all of his homework and it seems like the most important thing in his life are academics? I didn't really understand that, because love was everything to me. But I've grown to find out that I can live a life where the most important thing to me is my education. I'm sure there's something out there for you, too, that you're going to love.  Love... love is a lot like stepping outside of reality. Because when you're in it, it's all that matters. And when you're out of it for a little bit, it's like... it's like seeing through the clear sky, when you finally get to see the sun rising on the horizon after a storm. It's a really beautiful thing. But it's going to be impossible for you to feel like any of that is true - like any of what I'm saying is true, until you experience it yourself. And that's going to take some time, okay?  Time. Time time time time. That's literally all it's going to be for you right now is finding out how to spend your time.  Yo man, grief is a cycle. And you lost somebody very dear to you. But it's very possible for you to get stuck in a cycle. But at the same time, you can't skip around it... You need to give yourself time to grieve.   My mother told me that I got one ""breakup"" day. She took me out for sushi, and we got some great food. It was a sort of funeral for my feelings. And, I don't know if you've ever been to a funeral, but I think we can both come to an understanding about what it's about.  A funeral is a celebration, in a sense, of the great times that you had with a person. It's the grieving. It's the wallowing in self pity. Then, it's letting go.  My advice is to give yourself some time. A day. A week. I don't know, give yourself however long you think it's going to take. But promise yourself that after that day/week is over, that you're going to start the process of getting over her.  Which... you're not going to want to do. But you just have to.  I'm here if you ever need any advice, man. It's a very sad thing, and it does get a lot easier. But if you ignore everything I'm saying, that's fine, too. Just know I'm always here if you ever think back to what I said, and think ""Wow. That guy was spot on."" We're all here for you, man. :) Good luck."

The greatest comedian of all time wrote this amazingly beautiful song, expressing everything I've felt and my motivation for wanting to be a comedian in the first place; just smile, and make others smile, because even if you're feeling pain and sadness, you might be able to make others feel better. And maybe they'll be less likely to make you feel badly about yourself as well. But it's becoming harder and harder and harder to smile.  I feel as though I'm constantly surrounded and bombarded by various statistics or articles or videos that are written with the motivation of ""here's why straight white men have ruined the world today, and if you are one here's why you should feel guilty for who you are.""  It's gotten to the point where I don't share my opinions on anything socio-political or even relating to anything involving gender, race, religion, politics, or whatever. Anything that could be seen as ""me supporting the patriarchy"" or ""being a cishet-racist-homophobic-asshole"" (I had not ever heard that prefix until sometime last year), I've held to myself. Even if it's something I might happen to agree with, I don't respond to it because I'm afraid I'll be met with ""we don't need your opinion"" or ""fuck off, white boy"". I've actually had some of that happen earlier this week.  It's gotten to the point where I've had to bite my tongue for so long that I feel like anything I might have to offer or say or do or contribute to the world will be met with ""fuck you, your opinions don't matter, you're the enemy because of who you are (read: something outside of my control).""  I've even had this since high school; I had to read Three Cups of Tea, you know, that book written by that guy who was later revealed to be a lying twat? I had to read that for class because one of the teachers at my high school was the most bleeding-heart liberal you will ever come across. Every other assembly was something about ""here's why you should feel badly about being born in the United States"".  I've tried as hard as I can. But there's nothing I can do that will ever be enough, because there will always be someone who will see anything I'm doing or saying or even thinking as ""Hey, this guy's supporting the patriarchy, this guy's a racist-sexist-homophobic asshole, let's get him!""  I'm so tired of trying and failing. I just want to connect with other human beings on some level deeper than ""Oh, cool, you like video games/Doctor Who/comic books/some other arbitrary pastime too? Neat."" But that will never happen. I will never be enough because of who I am. My opinions/thoughts/ideas will never matter. I will always fail. It will never be enough."

And I got addicted to them caring and worrying about me. And now I guess I'm more stable even if my support group is a bunch of medical people that don't want me to kill myself. At least I'm happy when I see them which is a first. They're nice people.  Anti suicide groups are free. Call a hotline and they care.

Her mum has obviously put her under a lot of stress and made her feel bad about herself. The best thing you can do for your girlfriend is let her have her space, and when she's ready to talk again show her how deeply you care for her (I can tell that you care a lot). Girls want to know you will be there for them when they need you but while her mum is stressing her out messaging her too much might just make her feel more stressed, and you don't want to be the one to make her feel stressed, you want to be the one to make her feel better. In the mean time, focus on yourself. You need to be able to make yourself happy, to be strong and independent and self assured. You're going to be fine, I promise.

Moving out of home, starting life as an adult... or at least try doing whatever we've been told. I failed the second year in the university, because of my panic attacks i still cannot deal with just finishing this education, i actually don't really enjoy. You should not give up on yours, since you have passion for it. I know it is hard going with low self esteem, but if there is something worth doing in this life, it is to use your talents for inventing a future for yourself.   The part with your boyfriend... I am on and off getting together with mine. He is right now sleeping close to me, but he is being distant and actually so far away for a long time. I love him and he is one of the major reasons to keep going and try to get better. We are moving in together in a new place in less than two weeks, this is the one thing mostly that keeps me away of finishing myself. I don't want to hurt him. It is just too sad he, the one that used to call me soulmate, is looking right trough me, completely passionless, seeing only mental cunt... a flatmate ...

SuicideWatch,3dt3w6,ManiacL,2,Sun Jul 19 04:54:16 2015 UTC,"Hey there man.   I read your story.  I relate a lot to your story.  I too had a girl promise to love me forever, and cheated on me with my best friend.  They recently got married.  Needless to say, it destroyed my world.    You and your family seem like amazing people always willing to give the shirt off your backs to someone who needs it or wants it.  Thats an amazing trait in this world.  You have been hurt, screwed over, and forgotten about by people you opened your trust to.    Thats a tough feeling.   There are a lot of people willing to take advantage of nice people.  I am sorry that you were treated this way, and I am sorry that this happened to you.   You didn't deserve any of this.    I know the feeling of having all of your hopes and dreams smashed in front of your eyes.   I want to share a couple of things that helped me:  First: Get lots of sleep.  You will think better and be able to make better decisions.  Tell your girlfriend that you love her, that you want to be with her, but that you can't play these games anymore.  Tell her to call you if she ever changes her mind.  Tell her you love her family and that you will miss all of them in your life, and especially her.  Now walk away.  Don't contact her and let her make a decision.  It might be the hardest decision you will ever have to make, but in the end, this is what I should have done instead of dragging it out for another year.  Not only does this give you some sense of pride back, but it has the possibility of her realizing that she is the one that needs to make a decision.  Odds are that she will probably call you.  But if she doesn't, its time to let go.   You have to find a way to laugh.  Weather by watching funny videos, jokes, or whatever, you need to laugh and smile.  Try to find a way.  It will make you feel a million times better.    As far as your family fighting:  You know what they say ""the only time to panic is when the fights stop, then you know there is nothing left to fight for.""  I think every family has its drama.  Thats ok.    Focus on yourself.   You can't please everyone, and at the end of the day, the whole world is against you.   Push it all out of the way and focus on you.  Weather its goals, dreams, or just getting a new t-shirt, focus on yourself.  I started meditating.  Everyone thought it was weird, but it makes me feel so much better.    Anywho, just advice from a guy who has been in a similar position.  I don't know you personally, but I can tell just from your post that you are a good person.  I sincerely wish the best for you and hope you can get feeling better.  Hit us up here if we can do anything at all for you!  Best wishes!"

You have many reasons to stick around with us here in the land of the living.   Just remember this one thing: you want to live. You can have that happiness. Just because you can't find that feeling this very second doesn't mean it won't come back.

SuicideWatch,3dt3vw,KalarMar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:59 2015 UTC,"Your guilt is understandable and is a good sign, because it shows that you know what you did was wrong and regretful.

SuicideWatch,3dt3vw,zler,3,Sun Jul 19 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"I dealt with a lot of these same guilts as a teenager as well. I also experimented with animals, and at the time, it would seem like something natural and interesting, but then I'd feel a deep guilt and paranoia for some time afterward. I had to do a lot of soul searching to come to terms with this aspect of myself, but once I faced the guilt and realized I wasn't terrible or evil or unworthy, I grew from it.  You might ask yourself: am I doing this because I'm attracted to animals, or am I doing this because I want a sexual outlet and this is a safe way of doing it?  Being attracted to animals is not something to kill yourself over, and neither is being a horny teenager experimenting. But try not to make yourself false promises you can't live up to. If you're attracted to animals, and you're telling yourself you'll never do it again, you might want to reevaluate and come to terms with the reality of your sexuality. If you're simply experimenting, I suggest finding a human partner that you can practice safe sex with. You'll likely find it more rewarding, anyway.  As for your parents and your psychologist, well, it's up to you. My parents don't know I'm a zoophile, and I choose not to tell them because I know they'd rather not know about my sex life :P Parents aren't really the first place I'd turn to for a sexual confidant, but that's me. As for your psychologist, that's hit or miss. They are bound by confidentiality, but I'm not sure where they stand on bestiality and the law. Many psychologists are up-to-date on zoophilia as a phenomenon. It's a thing, and it's normal. It's not even considered a problem unless it causes distress, like this issue is causing you. Bestiality, as far as animal abuse goes, can be a sign of psychopathy, but you wouldn't feel guilt if you were a psychopath, so that's probably not a problem.  But again, you might just be experimenting, in which case, you can rest assured you're not the first person to do it who turned out normal and functioning and not a zoophile or serial killer. It's something that happens in everyone's life. You can leave it in your past, and it will most likely stay there."

I want to die. I’m planning on killing myself by the end of the year. Not today. Not this week, but soon. I’ve wanted to die for so long. I have no goals, no ambitions, and no desires. I’m an empty shell of a man. College football has long since been something I’ve enjoyed, but over time its left me, and I can’t seem to enjoy anything right now. I think I should have the right to. I have no friends, no girlfriend, no debt, no pets, and no responsibilities, no hobbies, just nothing. If I disappeared right now, I don’t think anyone would even notice. I’d probably just rot away, letting my body collect paychecks, bills, and dust. I’ve tried different medications and different lifestyles. I’ve accomplished a lot, graduating college, volunteering, staying fit, traveling the world, becoming successful at work, but I don’t really care. The only thing I felt like doing for the past couple years is sleeping and finding myself at the bottom of a bottle. I’m probably going to miss the last half of the season this fall. But it’s ok. College football will still be here to enjoy for the rest of you and your friends and family. I’m happy that a lot of you have been able to crack a smile from me once in a while here, but I’m excited to whatever comes after death now. I guess I just wanted to say good bye and thanks /r/cfb and cfb subreddits!"

There's nothing wrong with who you are, people are just shallow and that shallowness tends to show a lot more on the internet. I'd recommend staying away from things like this as they'll just trigger you to feel bad and by actively seeking out these things you're just reinforcing the whole idea that you are a 'mosquito'. You're not and there are people out there that aren't autistic and don't think this way. I too require lots of help and rely on others for even the most basic things. Granted it is for different reasons but that doesn't mean you're a waste of space. Are you able to get a therapist with whom you can work through these feelings and thoughts with?

You could give yourself up to death, or you can give yourself up to people who are smarter than you and truly care about your wellbeing.  I'm still working on myself, and I'm dealing with my own issues, but at least now I have people to call who understand and are smart enough to help me calm down.  If anything there are free anti suicide lines you can call OR TEXT for free and they will listen to you tell them they need to fuck off for as long as you want.

THEY ARE SELFISH FOR WANTING US TO LIVE IN PAIN EVERY DAY SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WANT US AROUND.  T_T  As for the fear thing, I have a theory. What if the fight or flight response is fake?  There's no proof that when we die, we're truly dead.  What if, to prevent people from committing mass suicide because ""life"" after death is better..... they give us that response, so we wouldn't do it?  Think about it.    What would you do if you live in an awesome place, and you have these people in a terrible place wanting to come here (only way there is death), what would you, as a higher up being, do in order to keep them out?  Granting eternal life won't cut it because you do want some people trickling in to your world.... so the only legit way is FEAR.  If you have the other side, where the crappy people live.... have fear of death, afraid SO much that they cannot kill themselves to come to your world.... then you basically solved the potential problem.

SuicideWatch,3ds5i4,AgentWitneyWiggleton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:23:26 2015 UTC,"Your analogy makes sense. Beyond that, I understand as well: I was in a similar position a few months back. Some days I didn't eat or go to the restroom, just slept for days. Life was hard. It still is hard, but I remember how especially terrible I felt during that time. I'm sorry you are experiencing it as well. Do you have friends and/or family that know about what you're going through? Do you feel like you have a solid support network?"

That it's hard to do normal things because of your depression and you don't know where to start.   They may give you a little questionnaire to fill out- answer it honestly. My doctor recommended SSRIs and talk therapy. You could certainly get a referral to a psychiatrist as well. The meds helped me A LOT. It numbed the numbness, if that makes sense. It lifted the weight off of me so I could rediscover old hobbies and coping mechanisms and FEEL again for real.   Remember your doctor has seen and heard way worse stuff than this. Someone identifying a real problem and coming in to ask for help is every doctor's dream. You're doing the right thing."

But i read your posts and felt compelled. You brought up a topic that I've toyed with in my head for a long time and never had the ability to put into words nearly as well as you did:   I have an interest in science and physics. I believe that when I die I the means by which I am conscious will be recreated again eventually. I'm a materialist and do not believe in a soul, or an actual afterlife. I believe that everything that can happen will happen. We reside in a quantum multiverse, which is by nature static and eternal. There was no beginning, and there is no end. Everything that can happen will happen and infinite number of times, or otherwise it cannot happen at all. I will be back, but life is probabilistic, as everything is random. I could come back with a new appearance, a new species, a new life, or perhaps the same life with different events.   I think this is my view of the universe too. I study Statistics, and the one thing i keep coming back to is the fact that our universe exists now. We are alive. This is an event that occurred in the history of space-time. Hence, by the very nature of infinity, it has to occur again. and other universes have to occur again. Infinitely many, in fact. I can't explain it as well as you did, but I just wanted to say thank you for putting it into words - I've tried explaining this theory to other people and they just kind of look at me with a blank stare, lol."
SuicideWatch,3dq988,KucheeKopee,6,Sat Jul 18 13:23:57 2015 UTC,"Hey thank you very much, if you're interested I could send you my math, and theoretical experiments that could be done to prove what I've said.   I have an interesting take on the EPR Paradox, as well a a solution to Hawking's issues with blackholes. I've never published my work simply because I don't want the attention, but now that I'm going to die I would be more than willing to send those papers to someone rather then delete them when I wipe all my drives, before tonight."
SuicideWatch,3dq988,KucheeKopee,6,Sat Jul 18 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd definitely love to see them but to be honest I probably wouldn't have any clue about the details... or any of it really, lol. I don't even know off-hand what the EPR paradox is... (although glancing at the wiki page I guess I'm somewhat familiar with the idea).  i'm not gonna try to talk you out of what you're planning to do, because reading your posts I can't possibly understand everything you must be feeling. It was overwhelming to me to read so how it must have FELT to you... unimaginable. And I'd lose trust in humans too if it had happened to me.  It does make me wonder though, you've done all this work and clearly put lots of effort into thinking about it. I get the not wanting attention, but do you suppose there's any way it could be published anonymously? It would be a pretty amazing ""screw you"" to all the people that made your life hell if you helped formulate some theory about the universe that sticks. I'm super interested in it but I also think there's more you could do besides sending it to me given my lack of knowledge on the matter.

I also had to invent my own abstracted version of a few aspects as well to properly ascertain certain engineering portions for a few devices that are detailed in my papers. They're all in pdf format so most people should be able to read them.     Among these devices are a potential solution to Aubrey de Grey's telomere problem, which will provide an additional 10-30 years of life to most grown adults, if it works as intended.  A nano-scale machine which very well may solve the problem of world hunger if it could be kept in the hands of the many instead of the few.  A solution for Hawking radiation, and disproving the big bang singularity due to the behavior of the bohmian trajectories in my paper, and this section is also coupled with an explanation of dark energy which will become self explanatory along with baryon asymmetry, and dark matter."

This is a portion of what I have been doing.  Also I'm not entirely certain I'm correct yet either as there's certain experiments that must be undertaken, two of which are not yet testable, but should be within the next two-three years.

SuicideWatch,3dq988,Spookstreet,5,Sun Jul 19 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm really fucking sorry for everything you've been through. No one deserves to be put through what you have and I'm so damn sorry you were raped. The way you were treated even after making positive changes for yourself is not fair. I read the whole post you talked about and I could relate to a lot of it. I struggle with chronic and severe mental illnesses and too dropped out of high school. I was also bullied pretty badly and never had friends. I grew up with a very abusive father and I was always the 'loser' and the social degenerate that everyone liked to pick on just because of how vulnerable I was.  Even now, after being out of school for over 2 and a half years, my life is shit. I've done nothing and can't do nothing in terms of getting a job or returning to study in this time and I'm pretty much fucked over in the sense that I'm disabled. I've tried absolutely everything I can think of and I've reached out for help and have gotten help but it's become clear to me how hopeless my situation is. I have no future prospects and the only reason I honestly stick around is because of my family. Every day is a struggle just to make it to the next, and for what? I've had several opportunities to end my life before but at the last possible second, decided to not.  I'm not going to tell you it gets better and all that bullshit because I don't even know that myself and even if it does, WHEN? I'm not going to tell you not to end it either because that is not my decision and your life belongs to you. As much as I wouldn't want you to do something like that, it's not fair or humane for someone to suffer so much. I myself, whilst not completely sure, have come to accept that the likelihood of me actually killing myself in the future is somewhere near certain. I'm sorry it's come to this and I'm sorry for how this world has treated you. I don't know what else to say aside from that I can understand your pain, even if it's somewhat, or different."

It's sad knowing that there are other people out there who are struggling like me, who sure as fuck do not deserve to but do anyway - for whatever reason.

I know how this feeling is like,cos i have the same. No hugging, no cuddling, nothing. And this for years.No boyfriend.Never had one.Nothing.And i'm turning 24 this month... Today someone accidentally touched my naked arm in the tram, and i was like: OMG,body contact!  So strange was the feeling of someone elses skin on my body..  It's an awful feeling,i know.It's so sad and lowers quality of life a lot. When you hardly feel any hope, cos you know you're too weird or not attractive enough or whatever for others.That you're maybe lovable, but the chance that you accidentally meet someone who finds you lovable is really low(and it still has to be mutual too.So even harder)..  I can hardly tell something to comfort you. After all it's your decision. But i read somewhere in your posts that you're still in your 20s. Don't give up already in your 20s. Give it a try.You're still so young. I often dream of suicide myself, but i will not do it before my 40 birthday. There's still so much that can happen. And if not, then at least i tried it.

SuicideWatch,3dq988,kenryoku,3,Sat Jul 18 17:23:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly what hurts me the most, is a female could never love me, for me. I could fake it, I could pretend to be a different person. However that would kill me inside. I'm so dead already, all I want is a girl to lay in bed with and watch a movie, or a show, play a game, cuddle, have sex, have some form of connection with someone."
SuicideWatch,3dq988,manthisis,2,Sat Jul 18 18:51:37 2015 UTC,"I'm an almost 43 yr old woman and will tell you that the connection with another person is so important it is understandable why you feel the way you do without having it in your life.  At the same time you have to find a way to make it possible - get out of your comfort zone which is SO FREAKING HARD to do.  It won't be easy and you will feel awkward and make mistakes but it is so worth the effort.    I was married for 21 years to someone I knew for 6 months before we got married when I was 18, him 21.  We went through college, raised 3 kids and had a lot of ups and downs together but in the end, I felt so very lonely even though I had a partner.  We just weren't really compatible for marriage (though we are freaking awesome parents and friends!!).  Leaving and becoming comfortable with myself - flaws and all (at 100 lbs overweight at the time, trust me I wasn't really hot stuff lol) and determining what I really wanted out of life and slowly making changes to make those goals happen was vital to becoming a happier person.  There are always, ALWAYS going to be bad days mixed with the good.  It's actually a good thing in my mind because I appreciate the  happier moments so much more now.  However, if you feel as if the impending doom and gloom never leaves you then you likely should seek professional help.  Don't be ashamed of going to a therapist and/or taking medication.  So many people are in the same boat as you are - we are a world full of lonely people.  It does require change on your part to fix your situation.  A small change would be to eliminate you looking at social media since that bothers you.  Most people tend to make their own situation look better than it really is.  Ignore haters and trolls.  Yeah, a lot of people and things about our world that suck BUT if you look closer you will find there are so many more good people and places and moments to enjoy than you ever imagined.  I hope the best for you. (HUGS)."

SuicideWatch,3dq988,MissyKoneko,3,Sat Jul 18 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"Just please understand that you are NOT alone.  At least give yourself more time and opportunities to figure this world out.  I've been at the verge 2 times of suicide and stopped due to friend intervention. My (now) 17 yr old daughter took an overdose of Xanax when she was 13 - THANKFULLY (after 3 days in medical unit, 1 week in psychiatric care and ongoing therapy and treatment) she was ok.    You seem so damned intelligent and remind me of my 20 year old son in those regards.  He's a dorky gamer in college studying computer programming (I think, I forget lol).  He was and still can be very socially awkward but found like souls to be around which helped him (there is no one right solution for everyone, you just have to figure out what is best for you).  Ok, you dropped out of school - there are options, the end is only the end if that's what you want it to be.  What stops you from taking your GED courses?  Once you earn that, you can then move on to community college and it doesn't matter how you obtained your HS education!  On another note, I want to say I read that you were raped and will disagree with you that a woman would never love you.  That is total bs.  The person who loves you will do so for who you are.  I was molested by my cousin at 6 years old (he was 16).  Honestly, it fucked me up way more than I ever could have imagined.  Was it my fault?  HELL NO - but I didn't see it that way until my 30s.  When a POS molests or rapes someone else, it is because they are fucked up and it's about power and control.  You didn't say if it was a female or male that raped you, but it doesn't matter.  You were taken advantage of and hurt and abused.  If you have not sought counseling for what happened to you, please - I BEG you - to please do so.    I think that some of all this unhappiness stems from you feeling inadequate - that you should have stopped what happened to you because you are a male.  You were a victim to a heinous event at the hands of a monster and no more responsible for the abuse you suffered through than any other innocent person.  Bottom feeders abound unfortunately.  Please don't let this person win - fight for yourself and some semblance of normalcy that you want in your life.    Shannon"

Asshole people telling you stupid, fucked up things.  Please don't die. People are not trying to help you and instead they're trying to make you feel like shit about yourself.  I think you really need to sit down and make a list of your friends and relatives, when you feel calmer, and ask yourself who is being the most realistic, honest and kind to you.  Oh and as for your silly friends demanding that you sue people, lawyers are expensive as fuck. The ones that take on lawsuits for free or low cost do so mostly in cases where a wealthy defendant has committed egregious neglect in hopes that the jury's verdict will be favorable and generous.  Your friends are dumb and don't know anything and they sound like people who mouth off a lot without knowing what they're talking about.  I can  straight up tell you that because you are a minority immigrant woman with a disability, sadly many assholes in this country will try to take advantage of you and fuck you over. This is not about your merits. This is about how other people are.  My guess is that you can deal with the sad reality of racism, xenophobia and ableism. But I think what's gotten you really down is people criticizing you and making you out to be stupid, wimpy, cowardly and lazy.  Anyone who makes you feel that way is not your friend and is highly toxic to your mental health. Just seriously consider not killing yourself and instead take an inventory of all the people in your life, and who is actually supporting you and being there for you. For people to try to make you feel inadequate - when you have a disability and you're an immigrant woman who's not making much money - is absolutely shameful and low-class. These people sound utterly disgusting and useless. And I think they're extremely poisonous and you should stay away from them."
SuicideWatch,3ds8gc,duder501,3,Sat Jul 18 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"You're right. Thing is.  I run away from my problems until they don't become problems anymore.  People say not to run away, but sometimes running away can be the best thing in life.  When I moved here, I ""fled"" the abuse in schools.  It made life more tolerable and I ended up having more friends by the time high school ended.  It wasn't ideal, but it was much better than in NYC.  Now, I want to move out of state.  My outside family is supportive, but I don't see them that often 'cause they are busy.  My friends moved out of state, I only have FB.  The only ones I see often are my immediate family members, and even if they do not abuse me anymore.... just being around them AND being in this state reminds me of my bad past.  It's a trigger, I hate being reminded of the past, I cry and get depressed and suicidal every time I get reminded of the past or what I went through or what opportunities or choices I did not make.  I want to move out of Arizona so I can finally have an excuse (sorry I'm busy and out of state) when they ask me ""why aren't talking to me anymore/visiting anymore?"".  My husband finally agrees that we should've just moved out this past March and he stupidly extended our lease.... I can't take it anymore.  Everything that southern and central Arizona stands for, I hate.  Northern Arizona reminds me of the good things in life.  Any way, I don't know if I can hold on.  My hubby wants to join the Navy, he needs to lose 10% more body fat to make weight.  But it's been two years since ""he wanted to join the Navy"", he has only lost 12 lbs.... I'm afraid that by the time the lease is up, he still hasn't made weight.  I'm afraid that he's not really serious about it.    I get it, I'm also fat and it's hard to lose weight when you're lazy.  But if someone told me, ""Leenalia, lose only 30 lbs, take this test, and we will give you a stable job teaching you skills, that in 6 years if you want out (after traveling the world), you'll be FIGHTING job offers instead of BEGGING for them"".... I'd lose the weight, join, and get the fuck out of this state in a heartbeat!  P.S. the 6 years thing is 'cause he wants to go do the Nuke program, ex-Navy nukers get insane salaries when they get out....   P.P.S.  I'm not pushing him for the money, I'm just pushing him because I want to leave the state.  Once I'm out of the state and can cut ties easily.... then he can do whatever he wants.  If he wants to make the same $1000 a month salary, fine by me.... as long as I'm out of Arizona and as long as I don't deal with abusive behaviors anymore."
SuicideWatch,3ds8gc,duder501,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:43:50 2015 UTC,"Thing is. I run away from my problems until they don't become problems anymore.   There's a huge difference between running away from a problem and running toward a solution. And I'm betting that you know it but people in your life have convinced you otherwise.   People say not to run away, but sometimes running away can be the best thing in life.   Whoever has been telling you not to flee racism and bigotry is an asshole and an idiot.   Check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Great_Migration  Your pain and suffering is real. You're not making anything up. Racism and discrimination against the disabled is very, very real. And it's perfectly okay to get away from a place with assholes.  Remember, you're an immigrant. Why is it okay for you to only escape one form of discomfort but not another? Why is it only okay for you to want and seek out one kind of opportunity but not another? America is a very diverse place and it's perfectly okay for you to seek out and find the part of it that fits you best. White and black people have done so and it's perfectly okay for you, as a minority, female, disabled immigrant to do so as well. More importantly, it's okay for you to do that as an individual person. You have the right to pursue happiness."

I know where you're at right now (mentally and situationally, my Dad had a biopsy done on a lump in this throat last year), and I honestly feel for you right now.  But I'm going to be honest, if your Mom is diagnosed with lung cancer (which I hope she isn't), that doesn't mean it's necessarily terminal. With proper treatment and care, there's a chance she could beat this, and be around for your wedding, and to become a grandmother. A chance still exists for all of that to happen.  When you have depression, it's hard to be positive. I know it's hard, I've been there, and I am still there. I know you're scared, but your Mom is going to be scared too, and she'll need and want your support. She'll want you to be there with her through this.  I really hope this biopsy comes back negative."

I kept trying to put words down, but my head is so screwed that I kept erasing and rewriting and erasing again.  I was doing better when I got up this morning, even feeling optimistic, but it always seems that as the later afternoon comes, my mood starts turning to crap. I start thinking obsessively about wanting our of this garbage apartment that doesn't fix anything (including the outside door that keeps slamming, setting off the ptsd and the broken security locks to keep the shit that's getting closer and closer to us out of the building.) This place is a huge part of where the depression is coming from. We're talking to section 8 to break lease and move, but this place already sabotaged one awesome place we found in the country, a rent-to-own, even.   I'm trying, I keep trying to push forward, but I have no more energy in me to fight anymore.   That sounds like me, too, wanting to please others and be their ""mini-me."" I can't, anymore, though, because that takes way too much energy, that I can't afford to waste. I wish I could just do me and not worry about how much my family disapproves of me, or whether people think I'm a freak when I open my mouth. I just want to understand why I'm a fucking social leper.   I'm going to take an anti-anxiety pill and listen to Spotify for a little while to try to take my mind away from all of it.

SuicideWatch,3dpgii,xbassx,4,Sat Jul 18 05:11:55 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I know how you feel. I've been dealing with ADHD-PI and with the symptoms have found socializing very difficult. I don't have friends anymore; they either take advantage of me or they become bored of me. Before getting treatment nothing excited me at all. Parties, concerts, clubbing, drinking etc. does nothing for me. It's boring to me. I cannot stand the idea of doing these things and being surrounding by people because I would never be socializing with these people in the first place. I don't trust people anymore, and it sucks because I really want friends and not feel so lonely. I want to meet a friend and talk for hours about stupid shit. I want to have a friend go to the park and play with me and my dog. I want someone to talk to.   This social anxiety has caused so much trouble in my life, its an accomplishment that I come out of a Wal-mart without a panic attack because the line was too long and I was too scared to be surrounded by people. It's absolutely pathetic for me, especially being unable to find a job because of these social issues. It makes me feel like an absolute failure.   I know how you feel, and i've walked in your shoes. Your life sucks at the moment and so you feel worthless and shitty. I'm here to empathize with you, and here to tell you I wish there was someone in my family who gave a shit about me when I was suicidal. I have called the suicide hotline so many times and all of them were so bad. The last one I was told to stop crying so they can understand what i'm saying, and when I finished crying they told me ""now that you stopped crying, can I let you go? my shift is up."" Do you know how shitty that felt? I was telling someone that I could no longer take the constant panic attacks and wanted to die already, and they tell me to stop crying so they can hang up and go home.   I got the fuck out of this depression by immediately going to a psychiatric hospital as soon as I stopped crying from loneliness. Got medical attention fast and recommended places for inexpensive counseling & psychiatric services. Turns out i've had Inattentive ADHD and Dysthymia (Chronic Depression for years) and now getting the right help. If you're still here, please please PLEASE message me. I really want you to go to a psychiatric hospital; call 911 and tell them you took the pills so they will take you to get your stomach pumped and get evaluated at a psychiatric hospital.   You are more than damn welcome to message me and just vent on me and I will listen. Loneliness doesn't have one victim; it has several victims it takes into the dark with them."

She didn't do anything wrong to me personally, I just had the realization that the path we were on wasn't going anywhere good if we stayed on it. Unless you were besting her to the point of hospitalization, you can't have done anything wrong. Even then suicide isn't the answer. There are support groups, dating sites, plenty of things to help you move on. Go skydiving, base-jumping, hiking. Find something new and exciting to do to take your mind off things! Head over to /r/fitness and talk to them! They're great people, many of them came from this sub looking for a way to work through the pain. I personally attempted suicide once in my life a few years ago, and I can say that I am thankful every day that I failed. Trust me dude, things will get better, I promise.

You can get a lot of free help out there.  I'm not too familiar with vitiligo, but I googled it and was surprised to see so many successful people who have it. When you are feeling better, maybe look it up. Not just scary pictures, but the people who have it. They're the same people who have talent, partners, families, and awesome careers. I'm glad they're here with us. We are all just broken people trying to find happiness."

This isn't the end of world, though. Have you thought about finding a support group for people with your condition? I think this would be hugely beneficial for you."
SuicideWatch,3doxuj,throwawaytothetop,3,Sat Jul 18 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. Take a deep breath, inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth slowly, and repeat 10x.   First I want you to acknowledge that you are worth it because you haven't given up. For a 16 year old you seem to be intelligent, sweet and a kind young man. Right now it looks like you and your mom need each other the most, and I think you need to share with her how scared you feel about this and at the same time continue to have a relationship with your mom. Coming from a marriage is difficult, and loneliness is the worst feeling in the world. Spend more time with her with inside activities and share with her more often. Begin to try out new hobbies together that you two can share.   I would also get some counseling in order to help you cope. This is life changing and a counselor can offer some great tools and a new way of thinking. And don't be scared to find a support group for vitiligo! It's a huge deal to you just like how it is for others. It's a skin condition but don't let it dominate your personality and confidence. Being in a group is so beneficial as empathy is the best thing in the world when you feel like shit; you won't feel alone about it.   Good luck! life is worth it, and I know you're stronger than this.   P.S if a girl doesn't like you just because of the 'colors' of your skin, she's not worth it. Chicks aren't as superficial as you think they are; majority of girls just want to meet a guy who's funny, sweet, supportive and loving. It's all about that chemistry as you get older."
SuicideWatch,3doxuj,carterza,3,Sat Jul 18 06:00:03 2015 UTC,"Um...I have this condition and I felt like dying when I first found out I had it and there was no cure. I felt like you did - panicky, out of control, like my life was over, etc.   Honestly, I don't even think about it now. No one I know cares, and in the grand scheme of weird body stuff, it could actually be worse.    I told a therapist once and she's like...'so...it's like having acne, right?' I was like but that's normal, people understand that. This is freakish and weird and people will look at me like I'm a freak.   I think what she was trying to get at was that people who have any skin condition (acne in various forms causes scarring, is incurable, etc., there's psoriasis and other things you shouldn't google) or body insecurity will feel bad about it. Vitiligo is...kinda cool when you think about it. Your skin is still smooth  - it's just two different colours. I've heard of people with white streaks in their hair and it looks awesome from an artist's POV - like a superhero or something. Anyway, this might be because I'm used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore.       There's even a successful model now who has it, and with Bruce Jenner coming out, etc. differences are increasingly being celebrated. It's honestly OK. I just have a few spots, and you can use self-tanner if you hate them. Just wear sunscreen all the time (it will make you look younger anyway) and I don't know if you have dark skin, but depending on your pigmentation, most people probably won't notice. Stress is also the biggest concern, so don't freak out too much and try to just live healthily. If you still feel like killing yourself, here's a pic of a pigmented peacock to make you feel better. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cb/13/88/cb1388fab5e3016a0dc8be8ce4573ddd.jpg You're a teenager so insecurity is normal, but I can promise it gets better and you'll learn to accept yourself in time, my friend."
SuicideWatch,3doxuj,carterza,5,Sat Jul 18 06:59:18 2015 UTC,"Yo - you're 16, chill out homie.  You have a skin condition, herpes and something else going on. You're not starving in Africa, you don't have AIDS and you're not going to die anytime soon from any of the stuff you have.  Before you decide to off yourself, you should do some research about the condition you have. If it's a pigment deficiency, maybe you can alter your diet or your wear more sunblock to prevent the issue.  Suicide isn't the answer here - shits superficial man. Learn your lesson from catching a STD - herpes is for life but I mean at least you don't have warts or HIV. Ridiculous #'s of people have HSV1/2 and they deal by understanding what they have and trying to prevent others from catching it. I've dated a chick with HSV2, was never infected, and I don't regret it a bit.  I don't agree with the medication thing - depression is a cycle, it's a thought pattern, it's a way of thinking. I've been on the medicine merry-go-round more times than I can count. You know what helps with depression? Not thinking about what's making you depressed. You know how you achieve that? Distractions / hobbies / self-improvement.  If you can't enjoy the sun during the summer, go to an indoor pool / water park. Worried about the sun worsening your shit? Wear long sleeves - I do it all the time whenever I get new tattoos. Bored / can't find motivation or any joy out of anything? Smoke a joint, think about when you were six and what made you lol, and go do that shit.  I recently found out my outlet was music - hadn't played an instrument since I was 13ish, but man did I ever miss it. I'm not saying this shit will = a cure to your depression over night, but IMO figuring out what's causing you to be depressed, and then working on that is better than the end of a barrel OR meds from a doctor."

I also am acquaintances with two more albino people. They're black, so it's very noticeable at first. Despite this, they're some of the most charismatic and fun people I know. They can make friends with anybody, and have had long term girlfriends.  I could PM you contact information of my friends if you want to talk to them about your worries or ask questions.

That's a disorder you can't control, not your fault. And you say you're not normal. What is normal? Having anxiety and being lonely may not be what everyone's comfortable to talk about, but it's common.   When you went to therapy did you ever try any medications like SSRI inhibitors? I couldn't make friends due to general anxiety disorder and depersonalization. Many times I thought there was zero chance of hope and I was very lonely but getting my anxiety under contro helped a lot.  Maybe joining group discussions about certain things you're interested in like certain TV shows, movies, animals you particularly like, or just anything you're into will give you people to talk about.

I also have other interests like books and sports. These things do bring a little bit of light into my life sometimes.  But the big problem is that as long as my general situation is so gloomy, as long as I don't know what to do with my life and I feel unable to make friends, I will always feel awful and unhappy, and no hobby or interest is going to change that.  I recently learned of the term ""situational depression"" and I think that's exactly what I have, I'm convinced that if I had a better social life and a clue about my future I'd stop being depressed. Maybe not immediately, but gradually.   But how to get there? I simply have no idea what to do, in high school I was very good at languages and history, but you can't make a career out of that unless you decide to become a teacher, and that was never on the table for me because of my severe social anxiety and ""stage fright"". I actually majored in English and history in my short time at college, but even if I had enjoyed that, the pressure and my fear of failure would have been too much for me. Like I said, I've always had very low self-esteem, so I've always been scared of failing, no matter what I attempted.

I put a lot of hard work into recovering, and cutting way back on drinking was a huge part of that. I have a hard time cutting it out completely, even though I know it would benefit me, because everyone I'm close to still does so much. Sometimes I have a perfectly fine time, but other times, like last night, it feels like I unleash something really terrible and demonic on myself, and the work I put into being safe and recovering feels completely undone and useless. I never really know how the night will go so it's always a gamble. But being able to come here and ramble about it was really helpful; I normally isolate myself, and it just means a lot to me that there are people here willing to listen. I'm glad this is here."

SuicideWatch,3dprqe,shakka877,2,Sat Jul 18 06:55:24 2015 UTC,"If there's any consolation to take away from the way you're feeling right now, it's that it's a good sign that an experience such as this makes you worried.   I would definitely bring this up with your therapist/psychiatrist, especially you feel you're comfortable with talking about stuff like this with him/her.  Also, as someone who has undergone general anesthesia in the past, I would like to point out that the feelings of calmness and relaxation were the direct and intentional result of the sedative/antihistamine prior to being given IV anesthesia. If you found this experience exceptionally calming and relaxing, perhaps you are suffering from prolonged feelings of anxiety and/or tension headaches.   When discussing your feelings surrounding this experience with your therapist/psychiatrist, try and approach it with the mindset that you found the feelings of calm and relaxation highly pleasurable, and that this was a sign that you should be trying to achieve those feelings more consistently though constructive means."

SuicideWatch,3dprqe,earwaxyness,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"Unless you have both been anesthetized and required resuscitation, you don't exactly have a good point of reference to say that they are.  At any rate, anesthesiologists use some seriously good shit these days (I'm in neurobiology, and I've also been under general anesthesia - I think what I had was propofol), so at worst you will be quite groggy and in a reasonably pleasant way unless you made the mistake of consuming food or drink or have the physiology to have an unpleasant reaction."

As for the rape, please please report the guy to your school or directly to the police, for your sake and the sake of other female in the same building!!!

I don't know the situation in your State, but in CA you don't have to pay back till you graduate.  Check with the bank and see if you can negotiate with them.

Fatigue, Muscle Aches, Chest Pains, GERD, and I just literately feel like I'm doing from the inside. Whenever I went to the doctor, my blood pressure was 160/101. On my check up a month later, it was 121/81. Yeah, my SSRI may keep from having panic attacks, but it doesn't resolve my feelings or physical symptoms. I just feel like everything is coming to fast for me. I feel like friends are a rare thing for me, and that I'm either used, or being lied to all the time.

Don't even worry about that! So what! I did a lot worse stuff, and im just fine health wise. Stop stressing yourself out man. All these symptoms arent from your body, it's your mind. You're stressing out so much that you're creating them for yourself because you think that's how things should be. Not at all. You are perfectly healthy and fine, you just need to stop worrying about it. You are not a loser. Maybe your friends are annoyed, but good for them. If they can't deal with you then let them go. You have people you are worth something to. If no else, you have me. But theres more than me. Just stop stressing about the fast food cause in reality, it isn't the worse thing you could be eating.

I did not want to leave my sisters all alone to fight the monsters in our house. When they no longer needed me or so I thought, I tried every possible way I could to get out of that situation. From pills, cutting, running away. You don't need to label it, just need to work through it. Tackle one negative thought at a time.

Sometimes you need distractions to gain a different mindset, then you can re-approach your problems from a more objective perspective. Very often people get wrapped up in their problems and get overwhelmed, failing to see alternatives. This person is suicidal cause he's in a bad mental state, the most important thing is getting out of that mindset no matter what. Often the problems that seem impossible to overcome are alot less daunting when you re-approach them with a healthier mindset.   Telling suicidal people not to 'hide' from their problems is terrible advice. They're suicidal due to their problems, getting away from their problems should be their first priority, since they clearly can't attempt to solve them with their current mental state   I agree that trying to escape from your problems isn't healthy, but its a completely different ballgame when you're suicidal"

I remember sometimes when I've felt like this myself -- feeling like I'd rather not have been born, but I don't want to kill myself.   I promise you'll be okay. Nothing this minor could fuck things up for you in the long-run. If your boss is awesome, perhaps talk to him as another human being. Don't ask for your internship back. Just tell him how this is all making you feel. See how he, and your coworker, respond.  But, more importantly, make sure you're okay before doing anything.

Some teachers are willing to stay after school and help, or will be at least willing to give you a couple of pointers in terms of online resources, etc.   In terms of romance, I'll let you in on a secret as a teenage girl - we don't really care about penis size, as much as you think we do. Get good at the other things - kissing (especially kissing, no joke), foreplay and oral! It will help you a lot. Lots people don't even date until college or out of high school, not having a sexual experience or gf in highschool isn't going to be the end of the rope. Just be friendly, kind, courteous and keep a good sense of humor. Know when to stay your distance, when to engage, and when to be serious and silly. :) It's not the end of everything!

There are so many ways to change your circumstances.   It seems insurmountable now, but chances are it isn't. Dying won't solve problems and would devastate the people who love you. You can come back stronger.   When I was 23, I left my ex husband under a great deal of drama and turmoil. Friends and family dropped me like a hot potato. I was so alone. And I was pregnant! The only reason I didn't kill myself was because I felt like hurting the baby wasn't okay.   And I look back on that time (one day in particular) now and I'm like... God I would have never known any of this great stuff if I had given up then. I am happily remarried, had the baby (he's great) and another one and now another on the way! I have had some struggles along the way (because depression is like that) but have never regretted staying here and making this life.

SuicideWatch,3dne0k,Yagimitsu,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:27 2015 UTC,"Can you talk to your girlfriend about this? You could sit down and write a note if necessary. When does she leave to work? When do you start work? You could maybe set your alarm to get up when she does and then go back to sleep afterwards. It's difficult and shitty to talk about problems but sometimes it has to be done.   Are you living in her house or flat? Do you have any friends you could stay with, some money? If you could find a friend to stay with and agree that you could move in with them and pay x amount from your work as rent monthly, that gives you an escape place. Even if you never, ever need it, some times just knowing there is a way out, aka, staying with a friend, really helps.  If you argue, how do you argue? Do you escalate situations or does she?  Like I said, talk to her about it. If she's still being unreasonable then make arrangements with a friend if possible to leave. There is stuff to fall back on- friends (if you have them), family (if you have them). Were you happy with your girlfriend before? Are you happy at work? Something as simple as maybe booking a BorrowMyDoggy dog to look after for the day or making pottery or anything like that can bring more meaning to your day.   For the moment, if you're considering suicice...the thing which has always strangely helped me is TV and movies. Are there any TV shows on tomorrow or Sunday? Any movies coming out you want to see? Looking forward to Avengers: Age of Ultron actually kept me alive for months (and I didn't like the film, so...). Is there anything tomorrow you are genuinely looking forward to- maybe just a cooked breakfast? Do you get a lie in on weekends to savour? A cup of coffee which makes your morning? There is something out there which probably gives you a tiny, tiny bit of pleasure. Hang on until you find that and then wait and get that tiny bit of pleasure...even something like just eating supper today, and then think more of it, but until then, you can try getting through it by finding the tiny, tiny stuff which is there for you. It's not big. It doesn't have to be getting through it for your girlfriend or for your family or shit like that. There is pretty much no reason for you to be here but you might as well make your life a tiny bit happier before you go, by, like I said, hanging on and having a lie in tomorrow or whatever."

SuicideWatch,3dn0so,TW4ObviousReasons,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:25:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, if this helps, we can talk in Russian?   Anyway, in English, so:  Yeah, maybe you fucked up. Or maybe you didn't. I don't know the situation. But people fuck up all the bloody time. I fucked up when I teased my friend about stepping in dog poo when I was seven, and that meant the world was coming to an end. When I was fourteen and genuinely suicidal, I blew off a friend for a boy. I've fucked up many times since then. And they do forgive you. And move on. Let me guess, you've been fucked with at least once? Have all your friends always been lovely to you? It's impossible for that to happen. They've fucked up probably.   Your friend is angry. Very angry. Maybe, maybe, she might not talk to you again. But can you talk to her? Even through a friend. Just write a note, an email, a text, whatever, and say, look, I fucked up, I know our relationship can't be the same, but I've always cared for you and I hope I've not ruined it for you. I respect and understand that you are angry and upset with me and I think youd probably want me to back off. I know I messed up completely, it won't happen again, but you're very important to me, the only important person to me in some ways, and I fucked it up. I know this is all my fault and I will do my best to fix the situation as best as I can. You don't have to forgive me or even speak to me again, but I do want you to be happy (despite what you may think) so I want to know what I can do to help fix this. If it's staying out of your life, that's okay.'  And no, staying out of her life won't be okay, but that will make her calm down a bit! Send her something nice if you have the money- something personal. Hand write a card. Decorate a cake. Talk to the boyfriend and say you fucked up. It will be difficult. And shitty. Honestly, been there, done that. I got trapped in this shit and it felt like there was no way out and there is.  Okay, and another thing, it's great that you've had someone so important in your life. You may have fucked her around but why? You know it's wrong and you knew it was wrong. You did it as a game- but why? Did it help you feel in control, help you feel important?  If she does stay out of your life, and if you apologise properly, take complete responsibility and accept her anger, hopefully that won't happen, then you can find that same importance somewhere else. Pets. Something small like fish or guinea pigs or a hamster. You are their life. They are important to you and you are important to them. There is very little to mess around for them. You are in control. I've got a dog and that may be a step too far, but God, she saved my life and I have no doubt about that.   Also, it's not a danger to be close to you, clearly. Think about how many situations you've helped in. Have you ever held open a door for someone? I bet you have. You've made their life just that bit much easier, whoever you held the door open for. They probably don't remember you, you don't remember them, but you made their day a tiny bit better. Have you ever asked someone how their day was, said 'bless you' after someone sneezed? They felt, even just for a moment, that someone cared and that brightened their day. Okay, that's not personally knowing you, but you, you, just by existing, make people's lives better! You gave the girl advice, the best advice you could, and that helped. Whatever horrible stuff which has happened, you can't take that advice back, you can't take the benefits of that advice back. You have given her good stuff and bad stuff with your friendship- and that's what always happens! Your friend may have bad memories of these days but you will have made her laugh. You will have helped her when she was upset. You made her life better! You aren't a danger to be around. Sometimes you make bad mistakes and fuck up. Quite a lot of the time you make people's lives so, so much better though."

She is probably looking back wondering when you were messing with her and when you weren't, but that doesn't mean you were. And, you know what, even if she does think you haven't helped her? You did.

My depression makes it hard just to concentrate on basic reading and there's no way I'd survive in any STEM field.   Have you tried ADD meds? I had so much trouble focusing on shit and depression made it so much worse, but Ritalin helped immensely.   I'm spoiled, I'm entitled, and I know that if I keep this up I'm going to graduate with a useless degree and move back in with my parents and use all of their money until they die   I was spoiled and entitled when I was your age; that's okay. And you can't possibly know what your future holds.   I'm never going to have enough money to support myself or pay for my medical expenses and insurance.   Dude, no one does. You're not alone in this. The whole damn country is having financial issues- don't beat yourself up about that.  Bad news: You're battling depression. Really nasty depression.  Good news: Your position is way better than you think. You've got a high GPA, you're majoring in a good field. If you don't like it, there's always a reset button: Change your major, move, etc. You think you're not experienced, but experience is free and comes with time.

No one knows if it gets better or worse, that's the point of living, we are all alone, no matter how close you may get to someone an infinite distance separates you, and it may very well be true that you lack the companionship of others. Even will all this being true, your still a part of life, you still have your ontology and your sense of self and your story, all i guess i could say is if you did kill yourself, and you still had a sense of awareness of your life, you'll spend whatever's next wondering how much farther you could of made it."

Logically suicide makes sense majority of the time, but the human self preservation instinct isn't logical unfortunately. This instinct is the reason suicide is frowned upon. Its my life, its my choice what I want to do with it. If somebody tells me its selfish I'll tear their head off with no regrets"

I was bullied in my home country and people tried to bully me here. But this was a new environment. A reset button, per say.   People didn't have a preset opinion on me, so don't worry about moving, especially if you're unhappy with your current school. Sometimes you just gotta push forward even if it hurts.  You're not a useless piece of shit. You just lost your sense of direction and your brain is making you think you're pathetic for it. Everyone goes through that phase. You still have time, people in school at that age tend to be complete assholes.   Do you enjoy playing soccer? If no, consider signing up to do something you like. You'll find people with common interests easier at clubs anyways. I kind of miss how many opportunities to meet new people you have in school, even if it's hard for some of us to fit in."

Take up a hobby in complete self-interest, not because its considered healthy. I'm not saying you should act like your depression doesn't exist, but don't let it consume you. You are more than your depression and you deserve to pursue happiness. If I'm completely wrong, let's talk"

SuicideWatch,3dldbc,kevdeath666,2,Fri Jul 17 06:41:07 2015 UTC,"Emptiness really is the worst result. I'd give anything for the sadness. Empty people don't care, they can't, and only they understand real emptiness. Everyone thinks they can. They're wrong - more than they could ever know. They say to try and explain how you feel or your situation and then they think they have any idea, any grasp on it, that they could even understand or empathize. They're wrong. There's a literal barrier of comprehension that exists for people who aren't there themselves and the ones who are can't help anyone or themselves.  Then you try again and again, to all sorts of people, how close, or how distant they are, how much or how little they care initially. It never makes a difference in the end-game. They form false ideas and think you want attention because there is no way to beg for help in a way they can understand.  The anomalies are the ones who really try. If that's the anomaly, none succeed. They think you want a solution. I just wanted friends that had any level of understanding.  That never happened. It can't. Everyone talks about being pushed too close to the edge, like there's some cliff to fall off when it's too much. That's sadness. That's despair. That's loss.  Emptiness is a black ocean that doesn't understand a finite concept, there is no beginning, there is no end, and there certainly is no line to cross, all that's left is to sink. You could swim forward or backwards, but there's no land, there's no shallow waters, there isn't even a horizon. No finite concept.  It is not bravery or strength that keeps us going. It's fear, and that's all it ever is."

I'm not going to be one of those people who goes ""don't worry about others,"" because I've been where you are and in many ways still am, and that's just not how the human brain and psyche actually works, otherwise we wouldn't have depressed people because they could just flip a switch and things would be fine.  It's this awful line, like, is it really that, or does it just appear that way because it's almost that way. Is there a minor chance, or is it in fact face?  I don't know.  I understand the pain so very much, been there at time, live in a major city around people just like me and they mock me when they aren't ignoring me. VERY much ""which one is not like the others,"" as you said; quite astute, really.  It's exactly like that, even at volunteer activities and places where by all accounts it shouldn't and ""wouldn't"" be.  Yeah, I used to be a hardcore feminist and now I am the exact opposite. I thought that by moving to a VERY liberal place, the gender roles would drop out and people would be more free to be humans, kind of like some smaller mountain towns I've seen.  Not at all the case; not at all. It's like 1980 v.2.0 up in here, gotta ask out the women, be tall, make money, have hair, be confident, be fun, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, APPEAR THAT WAY.  APPEARANCE IS REALITY IN DATING.  Everyone pretends that people can ""smell insecurity"" a mile away, and while sometimes they can, everyone is insecure and it seems like only some people get passes on that fact. It's just a way to brush off someone else. Seriously, watch world leaders speak, they all screw up sometimes, they get insecure.  Yeah, I wish our society cared about men. I give food to homeless men in the morning, and it just depresses me.

You're in between childhood and adulthood and you feel a part of neither. It can be lonely and confusing and frustrating as shit. But remember, you're not ""done"" yet. Like a chrysalis, you're at an in between state. Lumpy and formless, depressed, tired. It takes a lot of energy to grow and change.   There are also numerous extensive research on the brain and how everything upstairs starts rewiring itself right around and during puberty. So our bodies and brains are a complete mess. It seems hopeless now but ""now"" will only last a few years.   Now is the time to explore new interests, hobbies, music, literature; all these things will help you through these weird years and contribute to who you will become when you're on the other side of all this mess. Never for a second let that voice in your head tell you you're useless. That voice doesn't know what it's talking about because its part of the brain that's going haywire right now.   But you CAN be happy during this. Don't let anyone pressure you to ""make"" friends. You can't ""make"" friends. Friends find you through shared interests and experiences. Keep your chin up, OP. Keep playing soccer as it will get you some exercise but play on an age appropriate league. You're not going to make friends with 10 yr olds. Have faith, kiddo. Things seem like shit right now, it always does, believe me! But it's not forever, you DO deserve to smile and feel useful and fortunately you are the only person who can make those changes for you.

When there are problems in a relationship or things are not working the way they ought to be, there are so many ways to communicate this to your partner and try to work something out, ways that don't include sleeping with someone else. This is something she chose to do, not something you drove her to. And the fault lies on her.   If there are things YOU don't like about yourself then those are things you can work on. Don't judge yourself too harshly. We are all works in progress. I think a good start would be getting a handle on your alcoholism (drinking will hurt much more than it helps in the long run) and your depression.   For your medical issues, do you have health insurance? Have you tried to get help yet through healthcare.gov (provided you are American)? If not or you don't qualify, see if there are any centers in your area that will allow people with no insurance to get low-cost healthcare. This is how I was able to break free of my panic disorder.

A vast majority without anesthesia too. My husband was circumcised when he was a baby without it, and he's fine. My two boys were circumcised, and though they received anesthesia, they still screamed their heads off -- but you know what? They healed nicely from the procedure and are normal, healthy, foreskinless boys. :P   Seriously that baby who got circumcised probably will be happy it was done, or just won't care."
SuicideWatch,3dm2n8,sarahwestern,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"What gives anyone the right to inflict this horrific abuse on any child?  Are you pro-life? A lot of people talk about how great it is that they have the right to an abortion because we are supposed to ""own"" our own bodies.  Yet we think nothing of inflicting this traumatic genital cutting on defenceless baby boys.  What about their rights? Isn't a child's genitals sacred any more?  Her body, her rights. His body, his rights. Period.  I refuse to see it any other way because this genital cutting is so disgusting and unjustifiable.  If you read back on the history of circumcision you will be horrified to find that it was deliberately being done to desensitize the genitals. And they weren't only doing it to boys. They were mutilating little girls too. And that tells me that the purpose of genital cutting is to reduce sexual pleasure. Sure men (and women) who were cut can still experience orgasm. But that does not tell us any more than that. What about the quality of orgasm? I am sure it is affected badly regardless of what anyone might claim. After all a person with cut genitals is not going to know what they are missing.  The only person who should decide what happens to their sons genitals should be the son himself. Who the hell is anyone to inflict unnecessary and damaging genital cutting on a defenseless baby?"

I don't know how you saw it, or how it was done, but honestly, it's not what you're really upset about, I don't think. Was there something that happened to you that seeing this brought back? Were you ever harmed by someone as a child?  In regard to the psychotropic drugs, drugs for mental illness continue to improve. There are excellent new drugs for depression. It is a good idea to find a quality psychiatrist to explore your options. Therapy is also helpful. Although there are many people who campaign to stop circumcision, and although the idea is very upsetting to some, the reaction you're having suggests something more than outrage over an unnecessary procedure."

They usually just put EMLA cream which should never be applied to the genitals at all.  The baby got EMLA cream but it still didn't stop the agony or the terror that poor little thing went through.  I'm not sure why I watched it. I was curious and just wanted to know how much suffering it causes.  The pain and terror of the procedure is just the start. It is the long term loss of feeling and damage to the genitals and even worse the long term changes to the baby's brain that really upsets me the most.  Nobody should have any right to do this to a child.  I don't want to live in a society where this violence to a baby is even tolerated let alone considered normal.

From what you said it seems like she just makes you feel more and more depressed so I would say just ignore her completely so you can get your head straight.   If these friends ""use"" you then they're not really good friends and you should try and make new ones. Making friends isn't that hard and you could find a new hobby where you can meet people with similar interests. For instance you join an archery club or rock climbing if you're interested in that kind of stuff.

That's my point.  There isn't really anywhere you can just go live, besides maybe squatting on land; we're past that point in history for the most part.  What perspective?  That people are self-involved and don't have to let anyone in?  That doing anything and expecting or hoping for anything is entitled, and the only perspective is that you need to smile, grin, and eat the shit you're served while those whom were deemed better get to feast until they burst and vomit before eating more.

Sorry, if I ask, but why are there no possibilities for you, where you could stay? Why can't you stay at your girlfriend's place / friends' places / other family members?   Would the money from that job you were offered not cater for basics? If you are at university, can't you reach out to some kind of counsellor? What about living out of a car for a while, would that be affordable? Are there no shelters or social services that you might ask? Maybe on some kind of hotline they have some adresses. (Sorry, I'm not from the US, so I can't tell much about this. I hope someone else on here knows more.)  Excuse me, if I ask stupid questions about thigs you did already, I just try to figure out what is status quo so maybe someone on here can give you more advice on what might be other ways to deal with this."

You're going to tell your grandkids the epic story of America in the 2010s- you're going to tell them about your own private hell, and help them through their own.

SuicideWatch,3divei,forevev,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:27:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, I can't say I know exactly what you're going through, but I can say I relate enough to sympathize. I was born a product of rape, and sent to the U.S. because half the people in my home country could see that on my face from the countries that made me, and the other half would find me to be a mutt of races they don't particularly like, let alone like mixing. I have this thing where Americans look at me and see someone not from here, and people from one of the countries of my biological parents just see me as a stupid American, and a disgrace for not knowing any of my original cultures. Through all of that, I occasionally go through this whole ""I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask to be made"" sort of mood.   What I can say, however, is that part of the reason I felt so rotten for so many years was because I felt like I had to keep alive for others. But the thing is, whether you live for them or kill yourself to spite them, you're still giving your life and all its potential in their name. You're still doing it for them. And I think one of the biggest things that got me through the rougher times was deciding to live for myself rather than for others. I don't mean that in a selfish way - I still care about others and will go pretty far out of my way for them - but the reasons I'm alive, and the things I determine worth fighting for, are conclusions I came to all on my own.   I started with something small - well, smaller than suicide: I decided that if I was unhappy enough to consider suicide, there was no harm in going to other extremes to cope as well. At first this was a rush; knowing I was willing to die at any moment meant I had a lot less to lose, so I made some big changes. I moved to a place I've never been before and tried to start life over, I completely changed my usual way of dress, I made all new friends, and I took up some new hobbies. Before I knew it, I couldn't even remember why I wanted to harm myself in the first place. It felt like I was so sure that I wanted to end things because I thought the world and my own part in it was beyond repair, but all I really needed was some distance from the stuff freaking me out. It gave me a lot of perspective. Before I knew it, I actually loved life a lot. Of course, this message will make it sound like this process happened a lot faster than it did, but once you get going the time flies.  If you have nothing to lose, and you have no attachment to your parents, then why not forge your own path? Your loved ones/parents would probably rather have you alive than dead, and you would probably have a life you wanted than a death you wanted."

SuicideWatch,3di7jh,mountainash,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"Well I'm a 22 year old college dropout living with my parents and working a security job that I hate. I battle depression and social anxiety. I think a big part of the suicidal thoughts comes from feeling like I've lost all sense of direction in my life.  I've always loved music and when I was in 4th grade was accepted to a performing arts school where I took part in choir, orchestra, plays and musicals, and our junior thespian group. I was very involved in the arts and ended up going to a performing arts high school as well for vocal music. In high school I was in marching band, jazz band, every musical, had the leading role in Henry V, and was in 4 choirs. In addition to that I started taking private voice lessons and singing classical music. Sophomore year I started going to vocal competitions and always did very well. I went to college for vocal performance and was accepted into the top choir, had the leading villain role in Pirates of Penzance, and was still taking part in vocal competitions whenever I could.   But part way through my freshman year I started feeling like I really didn't want to do this as a career. I brushed it off as just being nervous about the future and continued. The feelings only got worse though and eventually started to cause me panic attacks because I knew I didn't want to be there but I was too scared to tell anyone that. I started feeling suicidal and knew if I didn't get out of there, I would kill myself before long. So I called my parents and left that week.  I stayed at home for the next 4 months or so unemployed and spending almost all of my time alone in my room with the lights off mindlessly browsing reddit or playing games. Eventually I wound up getting a security job at the local mall because my brother used to work there and told me it was a real fun place to work. But not when you have social anxiety and every day in terrifying.  I used to know what my future was going to be and prepared myself for it so well that I ignored almost everything else. Now that it's gone, I have these hopes and dreams for my future but see no way to achieve them. And I feel lost and empty, my only sense of purpose is gone and I don't know what I want to do anymore.  Sorry that was so rambly, I just really needed to get that out."

It also seems like he was one of your biggest supporters, the person you could talk with about anything that bothered you. It's important that you find someone else who can help you out now. Find a psychiatrist, talk to a friend about how you feel, and hang out with your family, talk about your cousin and what he meant to you.   Yes, there are some dark times ahead, but it's important that you stay around for your family. It's hard for them too, so remember to spend some time with them.

We have expectations of ourselves and what our future will be like, and we're hanging on to the one thing that we know will make a difference, that will make everything else come a little easier, but then that thing disappears. It's a huge personal defeat that has a big effect on self-esteem, outlook, attitude, etc.  I've had similar feelings in the past about a situation I was in, and talking to/being with my friends really helped me out. Do you have anyone that you think you could talk to in person? For me, I knew my life was in shambles, but there were people who helped me through it. I eventually was able to come up with some new direction for my life and things got much better for me, but getting through the pain has to be the first step. I'll tell you about it if you're interested.  Anyway, you've posted here in SW, so I hope that means that you're trying to hold on to life.

I would love to hear your story of how things got better in your life. I know it's going to be tough road ahead to get over this slump, to be honest sometimes I feel so hopeless because everything seems so daunting, and I don't even know where to start, and maybe hearing your story will be the insight and help I'll need."
SuicideWatch,3dh37x,6a656e6e69666572,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:37:08 2015 UTC,"You know, you seem like a great person. You've got a best friend who seems to really care about you, and you don't want to bring her down while she's on vacation even when you're struggling. That speaks to your personality and character. Also, I assume you would have to have really good grades to even qualify for a scholarship like this, let alone make it to the interview phase. So that demonstrates your intelligence and diligence. And from only two posts I am seeing that you're appreciative, thoughtful, caring, and realistic, among other things. These are all good qualities that, sadly, don't get noticed or praised very often, so I wanted to point them out to you.  As for me (sorry in advance if this gets too long), I was planning on being a math teacher. Coming out of high school, I was sure that's what I wanted to do. It feels good to have a direction, and this felt like the right direction, so I went off to college to start working toward that goal. It started out well enough. I roomed with my brother, and we lived with some fun people, so I wasn't alone. I did well with my grades during the first quarter, the campus at OU (Ohio University) is gorgeous during the fall, and everyone is lively and friendly. Things were good!  Then the next quarter comes around, and I started to struggle with my math courses. I was only in Calculus 2, but wasn't understanding the material well enough. Other things weren't going well either, and I got into a rut. I wasn't making any friends, I'd stay in my room by myself feeling like I was stupid and boring, and the terrible winter weather wasn't helping much either. So I ended up failing Calc 2, twice in a row. After that, I just kind of gave up.  I dropped out of OU and started going to a community college back home. I hated that just as much, because I still didn't have a direction and still wasn't motivated to do well, so I didn't. My grades were still poor, and I was pretty lonely while I was at school. I would actually sit in my car and cry during breaks between classes, because I didn't know what I was going to do with my life. On top of all of that, my parents had agreed to pay for my first year of schooling, but that was up now. Everything from here on out would be on me, so I'd be racking up debt that I didn't know how to pay. I ended up dropping out of that school too, after just one semester.  This is where my friends came in. I was lucky and still had some friends around, and even though I didn't like talking about what I was going through, just being with them helped me feel a lot better. Then I met this girl who turned everything around for me. She brought some feeling of structure to my life, she liked me even with all my faults, and she believed in me even when I didn't. We started dating, and things just kept getting better and better.  Remember, at this point I've dropped out of two schools, my GPA is in the garbage (around 2.0 I think), and I'm now working a low wage job in an automotive parts store with no plan for the future. On the other hand, this girl has a straight 4.0 GPA out of high school, during which she was taking 2 years worth of college courses for credit. Maybe I should also mention that she was home schooled for most of her life, and almost completely taught herself through the course material and other resources. She's not just smart, she's intelligent, self-sufficient, and determined. She's amazing, basically, and she saw potential in me.  She went off to college, and during her first semester I'm thinking about her the whole time. She gave me my confidence back, I felt like I had direction again, and more than anything else I just wanted to be with her. So I went back to school. To her school. I just sort of landed on Computer Information Systems as my major. I didn't have any real reason to pick that, but it coincided fairly well with the courses I had already taken and seemed like a good fit for my personality. She helped me stay on track and was a great motivator for me, just watching her be her, breezing through her Accounting/Finance double major along with all the other stuff she was doing. I brought my grades back up, and eventually graduated with a 3.49.  We're married now, for just over 6 years, and she's still showing me up in almost every aspect of life, but we love each other. We both have good jobs, and I really like what I do even though choosing this field was kind of just a shot in the dark. Back then, in the darkest moments, I wouldn't have guessed that things could be so good, but they are now. Things can turn around, even when you're all out of ideas, even when you just want to give up or already have given up. It's strange how one person, or one idea, or just one event can be such a big catalyst that changes your life completely.  I guess that would be the message I'm trying to get across more than anything, that things can turn around in the most unexpected ways. We can get tunnel vision and see nothing but our problems, and we don't see a way out. Then something comes along and changes everything. Maybe it means we have to start from scratch, maybe it means taking a big risk, or maybe things just start to fall into place for no reason whatsoever. I only know that it can happen, because it did happen for me. Again, I'm sorry that this was such a long story, but I hope that, if nothing else, it makes you feel even a little better."
SuicideWatch,3di9mz,boobielooker,2,Thu Jul 16 14:18:21 2015 UTC,Good grief. I don't know anyone who wouldn't be suicidal after four days without sleep. I've found medication to be helpful when my racing thoughts get so much momentum that I can't get a grip. What do you think about trying meds?

SuicideWatch,3di9mz,mountainash,2,Thu Jul 16 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"Ugh. That sounds really horrible. Im sorry that you're in that state. As far as meds go, I was thinking something more temporary like a tranquilizer that could at least give your brain a chance to slow down, reset, and heal. Even just a couple hours of sleep can make a huge difference. Of course, im not suggesting doing anything without medical supervision. Also, I have OCD and Ativan makes my racing thoughts worse--That's anecdotal but I figured I'd toss that out there so you would at least know that what works for some can have the opposite effect for others."

SuicideWatch,3dgrbg,gaston296,2,Thu Jul 16 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"Hey gaston, first off, take a deep breath and relax. Know that there are many others that feel the same way you do, including myself at times. You sound like a very interesting person. I suffer from anxiety as well, it can be a great burden. I often have had suicidal thoughts too. First thing I recommend is not keeping these thoughts away from your therapist. I think it can just lead to more problems down the road. They are there to help you, not hurt you. I understand you're starting college in about a month, and that's a very big transition for anyone. It sounds like you're best off keeping busy to keep the suicidal thoughts away -- well hey, college is a great place just to do that. There are tons of things to do, apart from just studying, and there are many ways which you can keep yourself busy. That's something you should definitely look forward to. Medication will not always take away your personality. There are many different types of medication, but if you're adamant on not wanting to be medicated, then it's up to you. You have to come to a consensus on whether your thoughts are severe enough for you to be medicated, since you're not willing to tell anyone about them. I know it can be very difficult, I've been through it, but speaking to people about these things is not always harmful. You might be surprised how supportive people can be. I hope you figure things out and make the right decision, I can't make it for you, it's up to you. What I can tell is you is that these feelings are conquerable. I have defeated them, and although they still linger sometimes, I don't let them get the best of me. You can and will make it through this, stay strong. I hope you enjoy college, psychology is really interesting! Good luck with everything."

Even without going that far, it's hard. The other day I had one of my closest friends tell me the other day that he's disappointed his sister is going on medication for anxiety since she can probably control it through sheer will. I've been trying to work up the courage to go get diagnosed and medicated for depression so I just curled up, ashamed at his comments.   I'm really sorry to hear about your roommate.

Are you doing o   Don't be ashamed. It really does take courage to seek diagnosis and treatment--and it shouldn't be discouraged. I think for people who don't share the struggle, it's easy to brush off the pain and anxiety as weak will, but for those who face it--it's real. It's real and you don't have to fight against it alone. Even if a chemical imbalance isn't the cause of your depression (maybe it's situational instead), just talking about things with a counselor could help you determine the best course of moving up and forward. Not alone.   As for my roommate--I miss him every single day. I turn over so many what-ifs...what-if I'd dragged him to get help, what-if I hadn't walked to work on the snow day, what-if I'd asked the tough questions...I think it'll eat me up forever, but all I can do is try to reach out to others who are here and facing the same feelings."

SuicideWatch,3dfhpj,Spookyookyooky,9,Wed Jul 15 21:26:08 2015 UTC,"From what I've been told by my sister who has been to the ER many times, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes not, when a suicidal person goes to the ER, they are examined by a psychiatrist. If the psychiatrist thinks you are a danger to yourself or to others, you may be required to stay in hospital for observation for 3 or 4 days.  After that you will be reevaluated and if considered no longer a danger to self or other, released into the world.  If you are worried about finances, find out first if your insurance pays for visits to the ER or not. Most do but some only pay for stays at certain hospitals so it's best to call and find out first.  If you don't have insurance you may incur a huge debt. You can call the hospital and ask.  From what I've been told, your experience will vary greatly from hospital to hospital.  If you have insurance, why not make an appointment with an out-patient psychiatrist?   If you want more info, call a hotline and ask. Those are free and the people are well-informed and mostly very nice. Good luck to you. I hope circumstances improve for you."

That is far from easy, and it seems like the anxiety and stress is affecting you, which is not beneficial to you or her, right? You have to ensure you are safe and stable before you can help others. Self care is important  But it also sounds like 1) she might have some underlying recurrent triggers or factors that cause her to be in a this limbo-spiral, and 2) it sounds like there are a lack of coping mechanisms provided to her, other than yourself, to have her express her emotions, and try to work through some of the issues she may be facing on a daily basis (a hard task in itself). You have provided her with such support and care, but have you offered her possibilities to talk with alternative professionals, such as a 1-800 help line for kids, or school counsellors, as they are trained to aid with these situations.   It's tough, but you are that stable coping strategy. However, you cannot constantly be that last piece ensuring the dam doesn't break. Try and build up that dam with other resources, even approaching them yourself and seeing what they suggest (ie. Call the help line and see what they suggest you could say/ work on/ advice her/ pass her along to that help line). What do you think is the most appropriate next steps? Any ideas, or just plan out of ideas at this moment?"

This caused a rift between me and Mum. I have never seen my relationship with my family as close.  My School life was just as bad, unfocused and bored. My grades suffered, I think History was the only subject not under a D.  I have never had a job that I didn't feel soul destroying.   Relationships never lasting longer than a couple of months.   I tried to slash my wrists when I was 18, I didn't cut deep enough it seems. The next day I was hiding the cuts and pretending nothing happened. This point I was pushing everything bad to the back of my head and just started drinking, smoking weed and partying days at a time.   When I was 22 I was working for a Building company as a labourer. First job was to help finish a job at one of the local colleges. We got there, started work and it was then I met a girl. First time in my life I felt something good.  I got a mutual friend to introduce us and that is when I realise this is a girl I had been talking to a couple of years back on Faceparty.com..  Next 6 years, except for when she had a bout of depression and I tried everything to help her through it, are the best I have ever experienced, I could actually say ""I love you"" and mean it.  Everything bad in my life before then was a bad memory which was locked away in the back of my mind.   7 years in, I am starting to feel down. I am starting to draw into my self and stop going out. She asked me if I was depressed and I lied.  Summer comes and I finally land a job I can enjoy and again I am starting to feel happy.   Winter is just around the corner and my job is going great, I am starting to become a actual member of society. My GF ends our relationship.   I broke down. I threw myself into work and became withdrawn.   My job ended early summer the next year and that is where everything fell apart. I spent months locked away from everyone.   I over analyse what people say and strip away the good to find the negative.   I am rambling."

I'm very glad you met that girl and enjoyed that awesome 7 years. And you know what? I think that there is no reason to be depressed now. You had an awesome relationship and felt true love and happiness, you are capable of that, and because of that you will have that again with another person.  Your past was tough but you got this! Thats what I really think. Your mum cant hurt you anymore, you arent a defenseless kid anymore. You have proven capable of happy and fulfilling relationships despite the trauma you've been through, which is more than enough for a happy life even if you are single right now. Its very bad news that your job ended too, but about that I'm sure you will find another one too.  May I ask why you felt depressed 7 years in?

The experience of pain and suffering is a very subjective thing. Yes, it seems that we can measure the expected amount of pain against a presumed standard of how ""big"" your problem is - that there is some standard of how big your suffering should be right now. But my own experience has shown me that this is just not true at all.   There are certain problems that phase me much less than others, but than there are many problems that I sometimes fear I might not survive, because the pain just seems to eat up all of who I am. What is the point of measuring your pain against someone elses pain? Fact is, that you have it really bad right now. And the only thing that matters is, if and how you can eventually begin to feel better.  Being in huge pain after a breakup as such normal and ""healthy"".  But still, it can be completely excruciating. And I am hearing that this is the case for you (and I am truly sorry that you have to go through this).  It sounds that you are in huge need of emotional support - of a person that you can open up to and who would just listen to you, without judging. Which is a particular difficult thing to find sometimes especially for men. Keeping your emotions all in under these conditions, seems to be the one thing that is escalating this for you further down the spiral. I do understand that you rather not talk to friends and/or family about this. Probably the fear of another rejection is just to overwhelming, if you would open up right now.   Talking out my pain in the past has sometimes been the only thing that kept me from harming myself. So maybe counselling might be an option for you? Just to help you heal by processing all these painful emotions. Even though I am no great fan of psychopharmaca, maybe taking anti-depressants for a little while might also be an option.  And in regards to your sister - you sound like a decent guy, who wants to be there for his dear ones when they are in need. But the thing is, that you are in need yourself - in great need. And that is the one thing that should be most urgent for you to take care of. When you start to feel better, you will be actually able to help her and support her. But right now, trying to help her will only cause more damage, I feel.  And last but not least, just some kind words: Life is utterly shit right now, for you - I hear you. And have a hug first of all. Also there really is no absolute promise that things will definitely get better. There are only probabilities - and the only thing that you can achieve is to raise the likelihood to get better. You will need a lot of love and support on your way to get better, and I am really hoping that you will keep trying to find this support. Just like you did today.  Have a virtual hug stranger!"

I don't know how much difference it will make right now as I lack real incentives but if I can find the spirit to get out of the house, there is a charity in the UK (where I'm from) that I may call.

In the end, it's probably a game of chance mixed in with your own drive. I'm stuck in a similar situation as you, but the only logical explanation I can make for you is that if you become super addicted to the point that it becomes detrimental for you, climbing up from there is so much harder. If you feel like it can take a little steam off of you, go ahead, enjoy life. Everybody needs breaks sometimes. But be honest with yourself. Never, ever, ever lie to yourself about your own intentions (especially with drugs). It helps if you only use them as a way to make a positive situation better (like, today is beautiful, this will make it more beautiful). A ""today is shit, this will make me feel better"" mentality is more likely to get you addicted. I have friends on both sides who are clear examples. If you want to talk more, PM me!"

It seems like you have parents who care about you and love you based on your father's reaction to your confession. They will not care if it takes you a little while longer to finish school. I thought it would be the biggest issue in the world when I told my parents about it but they were so quick to let me know that it wasn't a huge issue and that the focus should be on my mental health. I'm sure yours will tell you the same thing.   Everyone has their own shit and their own paths but one commonality is that we are not our failures so please don't treat yourself as if you are.   Are you upset that you lost Amanda as a friend or a romantic interest. Again, another issue you can get past with time but jw."

It basically seemed like we were dating at one point. And now over the last few months she has been being distant from me, sometimes going several days without talking to me, and she's dating around.   So I guess I'm more upset that I just feel like I've been thrown aside as a friend because she, and I quote ""can't handle how sad I am all the time.""

Depression and suicidal thoughts are extremely taxing on you, but they can also emotionally and mentally drain other people too. I don't think she meant that she doesn't want to see you, but that she also need a chance to recuperate.  If they offer counseling in your campus, it's in your best interest to go there and get yourself help. It's an uphill battle, but you don't have to do it alone.

Ok.. now pretend that baby is dealing with heartbreak. He's only 35, and has had his heart graffiti-ed, run over and then they threw the car in reverse and backed the fuck up over it. Both suicide and abortion can both selfish and shitty, despite reasons. You don't seem like the selfish/shitty type.  Please cope. Despair. But do not, I repeat, DO NOT let this bitch win. You are going to have a beautiful baby with a wonderful lady, if you really want. Hell, maybe she's got a better ass to bend over. You probably don't want to think that way right now ( I'm in break-up land too. I want no one else...) Luckily, as fate would have it, you got straight up SAVED from this psychotic person/monster, you have the upper hand for being a loyal hugsband, annnnnnnnd (drumroll) ""You Are NOT THE FATHER"" of her inevitably unstable child. The one she almost aborted? Why, so she could have her hugsband cake and eat her cheating cake too? Because when that baby arrived and looked 0% like you... she is THAT SELFISH that she almost terminated a child she now wants to carry due to, idk child support? Handcuffs to her cheating accomplice? God knows this cheating ex of yours and her new piece are not the loyal types. What goes around... well, it comes right the fuck back around.  If you lived in the Northeast I would be down for coffee and a hate session. It could be cathartic as fuck and I got some good bud. Trust, I'm so hurt I want to post on r/gonewild or engage in some fucked up slutty rebound-esque shit just to be like ""BAM! Not your girl any more, fuckstick!"" That's today though. It's easier to be angry than it is to be sad as fuck. But I did want to die...some days I still do. Despite my being pretty positive my ex is not the man I met 5 years ago, you don't just 'move on.' My heart still hurts (repetitive bandage ripping) but I'm on my way back to being my former, more excellent self. Oh, and fuck every a-hole on Reddit who made you feel shitty for wanting to keep a baby you thought you conceived. Think of them as gum on your shoe; annoying as fuck, useless and jaded by being chewed up and spat out. Yes I just made that up (just for you!)

SuicideWatch,3dd4ta,lelj3klerewr94f,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this elsewhere yesterday but I honestly think it's preposterous that people are supposed to have their lives figured out and somewhat planned by around your age. Your brain isn't even done maturing! I'm 26 and I still waffle between desired career paths every two or three months. I see it coming every time, realize it's just a phase every time, still fully commit every time, get interested in something else every time, and repeat. it's not exactly like your situation but this pattern is a great source of sadness and anxiety for me as well. I wish I could just stay committed to something and become legitimately good at it, but my self-consciousness and anxiety and imposter syndrome seem to thwart me each time. I'm barely able to pay rent with passionless side jobs and my mom still helps me out with some living expenses, which bums me out often. so I think I understand where you're coming from a little bit. it sucks. I also know folks your age and older who live with their parents or did until recently and similarly feel not ready to be an adult, so you are totally not alone. sorry if i went totally off topic and unhelpful, I'm very new here."

SuicideWatch,3daajc,TheAsianE,6,Wed Jul 15 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I am not well-established in my career at all. A number of my friends from my major in college are doing 'better' than me in many ways. Lately I've just been focusing on keeping my head down and attempting to work on my own things when I'm not working on rent-paying things, though it's very hard. I don't know what your desired career is or how old you are but it just takes some many people longer to settle in, and that's okay.  I honestly find it ridiculous that we're supposed to know what to do with our entire lives at 18 years old or younger, though I'm not sure if that's a relevant sentiment for you.    Please understand, the GoT perseverance is truly not pathetic at all. It's an enormous media mainstay that brings people from all over the world together in their collective gasps, laughs, and tears.   People used to gather in their living rooms weekly to find out 'Who Killed Laura Palmer?' and the like, but now the only uniting literal television event so ubiquitous is sports.   Game of Thrones is really the first thing like that that's been so prevalent and brought so many people together in the Post-Cable Internet TV Age. Breaking Bad was big but it seems like GoT has a much bigger and more diverse audience. We might stream it or dvr it at different times but the gasps etc. are still there, just slightly less instant and coordinated. Either way, it's a wonderful international community event.   Even if you don't participate in discussions or go OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK with people when a wedding turns red, you're still a part of it. Your energy and that of people like you is what keeps it going, and it's made for you and me.   And so many people care deeply for that particular character, which is lovely. Many of us see ourselves in him or see someone we love in him. It's natural get attached to his fate. That's the point.  However trivial it may seem, I think it's truly beautiful that this has prevented your leaving us."

It doesn't matter what gets you to tomorrow morning, the best thing you can do to make the situation better in time is to get there. Whatever it takes, Jon Snow or next weekend's wineglass or whatever settles you enough to make it through the night and think on it in the back of your mind until you're ready to get angry or get gone or otherwise pull the situation straight like the messy rug it is. You can do it, and if you give yourself time you will.  Day by day and step by step you follow whatever light you can to tomorrow, and sooner or later things will break brighter for you. You're not alone, and you're not a loser. Be compassionate with yourself, everything changes in time."
SuicideWatch,3daajc,Sysiphuslove,3,Tue Jul 14 21:17:33 2015 UTC,"Anyone who has read a good book, viewed a moving film, or played an engrossing game can attest to the peculiar capability we have as humans to connect with the characters, places, and sounds we experience through these mediums. There's absolutely nothing wrong with losing yourself inside a fictional world—it's actually one of the best ways to deal with the often harsh realities of the world.  I'm visiting India right now to visit some family. Over here you can walk five minutes outside of a world-class, five star hotel—with all the luxuries you could possibly want—and come across young children and elderly people (many even missing limbs) weaving in and out through the heavy, chaotic traffic, knocking on car windows and begging in a desperate attempt to scrounge up some money. I've also come across many people here who do menial jobs for a living, making a tiny fraction of the lowest minimum wage in the U.S., yet still leading happy and fulfilled lives.   Sometimes I think the course of life is like the tide rising and falling. At times things are great and everything is going perfectly— at other times it might seem like you'll never be as happy as you once were. The important thing is to always take a step back and assess everything from a neutral position before deciding how to move forward, regardless of whether you're in a good or bad place in your life.  Dying is easy, living is hard. Take your inspiration from the things you love. Perhaps one day you may dream up a character that someone will love the same way you love Jon Snow."

It is incredibly difficult to love someone who doesn't love themselves. I say this as someone who has slowly but surely alienated themselves from the people they love the most in the world over the past few years. Life is ups and downs, I know it can feel like everyone around you is having an easier go of it, but that is the unfortunate byproduct of our social media laced society. We get unrestricted access to each other's highlight reels. I can relate to the feelings of being unfulfilled by your current standing in the workforce, but that does not entitle you to self medicate and utilize unproductive coping devices for a quick ""feel good"" moment. Look, you're a redditor, you have an SO and you are down with aSoIaF, so you can't be that shitty. Love yourself, believe in the fact that you have the power to make the most of your life. Try and build up the skills you need to be competitive in the job market you covet, talk to your SO, be open and honest with one another; determine how you make each other a better person. I'm 25, I've emptied bottles of sleeping pills down my throat three times in my life, I've certainly self medicated and poured countless hours into a playstation, and I'm still fighting for my place in life.

I do look down on my passions at times, think less of them, and what I could be doing with my life. But dammit, its important to me and that's all that matters. I think less of them a lot but the time I spent was them was real, the characters fascinating and with every new story I read, I want to see more interesting characters and plots, still after seeing thousands.   I don't really have a job as well, and I keep escaping. A job is the grass is greener type deal, lots of work no free time. Sure I am envious of people with careers...up to the point when you realize they are working 9 to 5 plus extra time with maybe two weeks off during the year. Their life has become their job.

In the sixth grade I held a razor to my wrist for an hour while sitting on the floor of the bathroom wondering how my family would feel if I died that day. When being bullied in the 6th grade I once yelled at the kids doing it that f I killed myself, If they would finally be happy that I finally died and would they moe in with their lives satisfied that they made me so depressed I offed myself. The most prominent attempt I think about is when I tried to hang myself with a belt in the 8th grade. I was overweight and too heavy, and I had not fastened the belt correctly, so when I finally decided to step aside and lose my footing, I came crashing to the floor. I laid there on the bathroom floor for a long time afterwards, and eventually cried myself to sleep in a pile of towels until I moved into my own bed later on. I didnt talk for awhile after that and didn't tell anyone but they all dismissed it as me being a cranky bitch so I guess it didn't matter anyway. I don't know. I sometimes wonder."

It's someone you love hurting themselves and you in a repeated and predictable manner. Not one fucking part of this is your fault, you have done absolutely nothing wrong in this. I need to make that really clear because that thought will come into your head and cloud your judgement.  I'm gathering from your post your still <16/18 and living at home. I would definately advise against running away at the moment UNLESS there is physical or sexual abuse involved. You don't have the life skills needed yet to look after yourself and tbh you don't want them at such a young age.  If you are still a child then you definately need to contact child protection or social services, and explain your situation. She needs support and help in a way that you unfortunately can't give her right now and needs professional guidance dealing with her own issues.  I know this totally sucks right now, I know I still get sad looking at everyone else with their happy families and just for once wishing I had one.

SuicideWatch,3dcdmf,DarkHeroes5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:14:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the pm and the kind words but I already went down to the place and quit earlier today because the stress was to high. I found myself in the kitchen last night at about 1:30 holding one of the bigger knifes we have just to do it so I wouldn't have to go in today. I'm trying to seek help and might go to the hospital but I have no idea what they would say/do. I don't want my family or friends finding out as well. I will try and find a job like you were saying as a Civ in the military and see how that goes if I can get in.

Which, is, how I'd imagine someone in that situation would feel.  But if she's in another country, you just have to hold your breath and wait.    That sucks, but it seems like there's little else to do.  You've done what you can, it sucks (for you - and her), that it can't be more.  But you were there to listen when she needed it.  And you are more than open to listen to how she feels.    That's amazing.    I'm sure she's fine, she may just be busy.  I hope it turns out for the best.

I constantly remind her how precious she really is, not just to me, but to everyone that cares about her.  I tell her how beautiful she is when she's not feeling it. I try my best to make her feel worthy of things that are good, but she says how she's just used to abuse and 'likes' it.  Certain things she says makes me feel like she just wants attention or uses me for it, since the person she likes won't give it to her. Maybe this is just a cynical side of mine, so I still give her the benefit of a doubt.  I really wish there were more I could do.  Thank you for your kind words."
SuicideWatch,3dasps,sixseveneightoh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"Look, this is probably not kosher to say round these hereabouts, but are you sure you're not being trolled? What evidence does this person have they exist? Are you running off your intuition? How did they meet you? Was it through a friend? What do your friends think of them? Do they have opinions? There are too many questions to really ask here. Primarily, why should you care? Is that person not active in seeking their own help? Where are they from? Where are their loved ones? Most importantly, if you have never met this person, or accepted any evidence that they are who they say they are, are you okay with accepting that you have been mislead? Does the whole relationship you have with this agency depend that you never ask any questions?   I am concerned about the shape and scope of your conversations. It all seems to be designed for you to live in a state of anxiety. If you don't have many friends, it is likely the case that someone is taking advantage of you. The reason is because a) you are only giving when they are only getting support and b) they refuse to reveal themselves. Be sharp about how you call their bluff. These are likely people you know and have created this person to emotionally hook you in."
SuicideWatch,3dcojw,Theponcho,2,Wed Jul 15 06:05:28 2015 UTC,I'll listen. I'm on the same boat right now. That feeling.   I'll tell you this my life went to the crapper about 2 years ago and this hell I'm going through. But what I've noticed it's getting better. The reason being is when I hit rock bottom and forced to changes it started to get better. I had to do anger management upon court order to get charges dropped.   It works. I found that I can control myself but I cannot control what other do or say. I've learnt to deal with things that doesn't make my life pleasant and how to talk clearly and when to know when I'm getting upset and to communicate it then walk away before it gets blown out of proportion. Then comeback when cooler head prevail.   I would recommend talking to a doctor to recommend a support group. Again you can't control what others do so when you get upset.  If you realize that you are getting upset with the going ons in your life you have the ability to change it. As I have discovered.   Communication is the key. If you don't voice it people will not understand. If you do voice it you see yourself feel lighter.   If have been then please try and make little changes and make yourself happy.  You are you. Again able to tackle that mentality you'll be in a better place.   It's hard to learn it. I still get people get under my skin but it's not as bad as it used to be. I'm not angry or suicidal because I took some words to heart.   If anything I'm willing to listen. Contact me if you want to talk about what's happening with you.

I can't understand why they do not appreciate this. Especially because the apparently would never have the idea to try to fix the TV. Might also be, that they are trying to downplay what you do in order to feel better about themselves, but that's just a speculation. I'd be proud of you, if you we're my son or brother.   Of course you are grumpy when you are treated like this and all your sucesses aren't appreciated! Most people would be frustrated if they don't get any gratification for what they do.  However, most important thing is, that you realise, that you're good at things and don't forget about it. So far it seems like you do. Try to find gratification somewhere else, online, friends (exchanging honest compliments among friends is more important than some people might think) in school. Sorry, if I don't have any good advice. I just hope you know that somebody is impressed by the things you do."

It's probably a rhetoric question, but if I should answer, I wouldn't know enough about your situation to tell why you should not go on.  Point of going on in general? Whatever keeps people going: pursuit of happiness, playing a game which might be finding one's love or getting as much money as possible or as many girls or to gain as many perspectives on life as possible etc., wanting to make the world a better place, wanting to see others happy at least, etc. .."

Anyhow, did you talk to your parents about your situation, either your thoughts or your general situation? What is their opinion on it? Or does their opinion matter? Also,... by how much do you want to speed up the process?  I guess you're in the US. For me it is always difficult to understand how people in the early 20s have already given up hope, because I know people who fuked up quite often over here, and then, in their mid/late twenties, they started an apprenticeship and got a job etc. Because some people just were lazy, some had mental health problems, some got a degree, but in a field that is relatively useless...

I can't promise that better times are coming. But look at it this way--if you quit, if you stop fighting and end your life, you have a zero percent chance of finding out. If you keep going, keep fighting and doing your best to live, you'll have some chance. Even if it's a small percentage. And there are things you can do, and probably already do, to increase that probability that good things will come.  I hear you when you say that depression doesn't go away, just gets managed. It makes it seem like it's going to stick around forever and there's no point. Like it's a lifelong battle... well, that's because for me at least, it is. It's not right; it's not fair. It's not okay. But for me, I have noticed that each episode is less painful, because I know my triggers and what to expect, and I know it will pass and I will have my life back again.  I can't tell you why you should go on... only you know the answer to that. All I know is that for every dip there is at least some joy, some sense of accomplishment, some way of touching another person's life that makes each day purposeful."

SuicideWatch,3dabts,tostada,2,Thu Jul 16 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. It's not asking a lot to want life to even be moderately okay. To be happy for even a small percentage of the time. It's a fervent wish for a lot of us with depression. You're not alone in that.  How long have you felt empty? I don't mean in years, because you said it's been like this since you can remember... I mean how long has this episode lasted so far? The reason I ask is that the empty feeling doesn't last forever for me. The fact that you remember having a range of emotions gives me hope that this episode will pass again and you'll be able to breathe. It's always an awful experience when depression hits, and it tricks you into thinking there is no future. I have always come out of it, though. Maybe after a few weeks and med adjustments. Maybe after a couple of months and a couple of weeks of lying in bed. But no matter how terrifying it is to be in the darkness in the moment, I have always come out of it eventually.  I think that empty numb feeling that dominates everything is worse than just feeling sad... Does that make sense? People (i.e. people who don't have depression) seem to have trouble understanding that. It's almost unbearable. I feel for you."

I'm practically their surrogate parent. I guess my problem is I'm taking on too much. My mom has custody of my nieces, but she and my dad don't seem to put in as much effort in parenting as they did with me and my siblings.

It doesn't sound like you want to die, and it seems like you realize you have potential to be able to do something you enjoy. So I suggest working on finding it. Don't pretend to have ambition if you aren't feeling it. Work on finding something which fuels your ambition. And then work on forming it into a job and life you can handle."
SuicideWatch,3d9g6l,alekstollasepp,3,Tue Jul 14 15:32:34 2015 UTC,"The thing with that though is that in order to live off the grid, I need to get money in the first place. Just the property alone costs thousands of dollars, and in order to get that I'd have to save up for at least 20 years because I have to sustain my life and pay to be alive in the meantime.   My problem is the idea that I HAVE to have a job in order to be alive. Even if I just said fuck it and went to live in the woods somewhere, somebody owns that property and would inevitably come after me for some kind of monetary compensation for the use of that land. It's actually illegal to build a permanent dwelling anywhere unless you have some paperwork, and that requires large sums of money that I just don't have.   So then my option is to go to school and put myself into debt, and work on paying that off before I can even think of buying any kind of property.   And even if I did I'm just going to work super hard to achieve that, maybe spend a couple years happy if everything works out and then die. What is the point?"
SuicideWatch,3d9g6l,Accountant1992,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, well if you want a large property near the city you'll have to pay up for it. I'm talking about a small house, there are lots of DIY guides online for people looking to build small sustainable homes. I'm not talking about pushing out for a massive farm and eco community, just a small piece of your own land, with a comfortable house.  Or, work for a couple of years, and then buy a small property in Mexico or Asia. Somewhere cheap.   Yes, you do need money to make it happen, but the money you earn doesn't have to be your life. You don't need long schooling and debt either. Ever think of picking up a trade? Some education is half a year to a year long, and then you are off to work. I've a friend who got paid to go to school for an IT job - everyone in the program did.  What's the point of it all? Well I can't answer that; no one can. You make your own point. But death has no point. Either you die and nothing happens, or if you're religious, you likely go to hell for killing yourself. Life is pretty short as it is, and you'll only experience happiness while you're alive.  I'm just trying to give you a different perspective on our purpose here, because it seems you're caught up in trying to achieve status and making something of yourself that people will approve of. I see the value in working for 10 years at a minimum wage job if it meant I could envision my dreams in the future.   Edit: Because someone got upset, I'd like to clarify my position on suicide and hell. Most religions consider suicide to be a sin, and if you are religious, then there is no ""escape of pain"" you will achieve through suicide. I am not religious, and I don't believe in the existence of hell. But if you are religious, and are looking for an escape from pain, then suicide is not the answer you're looking for."
SuicideWatch,3d9g6l,cabbagebrains,2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"I am not religious at all, but I get your point.   I understand everything you're saying. I really do. And I appreciate the insight and perspective on what I'm feeling.   I won't argue with your logic because you are absolutely right. I could do those things. I can do anything. The problem I have is that I don't want to HAVE to do anything - I just want to exist and for me right now it's not possible unless I put in a lot of work.   My point is that it's absolutely abhorrent that people normalize the ideas of laws and an economy and letting somebody else tell you what you have rights to and what you don't. They normalize the fact that you HAVE to contribute to everyone else in order to be alive. Even if it's only for a little bit, you still HAVE to do it. You can't just simply be alive and do your own thing without obligation to somebody else. It makes me sick to my stomach."
SuicideWatch,3d9g6l,Accountant1992,0,Tue Jul 14 18:55:10 2015 UTC,"I struggle a lot with the idea of society as well. It's.. Well, it's weird. All the power games, obligations that you have to go through in order to work in society are strange. I try to not take it too seriously, it's all really a game in the end. If you can find a way to turn your daily grind into something you do rather than who you are, it eases things.  But I get it, trying to get by is a burden. There's no way way to get around having to support yourself, and it isn't for everyone. Maybe one day you'll come onto something that makes the effort worth it for you. :)"
SuicideWatch,3d9g6l,Accountant1992,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly I feel exactly the same way. Pretty much feel like I'm just biding my time until death. I've found a lot of it stems from me forcing myself to align with what others feel I should be doing with my life.  I would say find your own meaning in life, and find the others that you want to share that life with. Generally people are idiots, so try and find the few who aren't. You clearly have the ability to think independently. The world needs more people like you, although world will never show it."
SuicideWatch,3d9g6l,cabbagebrains,2,Tue Jul 14 16:24:01 2015 UTC,"Death is nothing. There, I would be completely void of any kind of experience at all. While alive, however, I live with the anxiety and depression that accompanies the realization that I have to justify my existence by essentially being a slave, or a slave owner. AND, if I don't want to be either of those things, people call me lazy or childish. I could not have access to any medical care. In some cases I could even possibly be arrested.   The lives we all live now are fucking horrible. We are all just flooded with distraction after distraction to disengage ourselves from everything that's happening around us. Don't you see it? How can you not see it? How can you not see how atrocious this world has become? How do any of you live with yourselves?   This is a serious question. The world is so fucked up man. How do you keep going?"

Without distractions people are forced to see the world for what it really is. The reality scares the shit out of most people, which is why they quickly go back to their iphones and ipads as soon as they get uncomfortable about the nature of our very existence. The world is far from rainbows and sunshine like the media portrays it to be.

I just understand how the world works right now and it's horribly depressing and there is legitimately nothing I can do about it.   I could very well work and buy a house off the grid, move to a new country, whatever. What depresses me is knowing that I can't do ANY of those things without somebody else allowing me to do it in the first place. I need permission from somebody else to just exist anywhere."

I really really wish for you to stay with your daughter until she gets married, gives birth, and help her to take care of her granddaughter. It may seem far fetched but these are the things that I cannot do with my father anymore. When I asked my mother when did he go, she said he went to a faraway place and won't come back again.  So live for the brighter days!! Let your child be your motivation to carry on! Be the supporting pillar when she gets bullied in school, when she's sad because of doing badly for tests.

If you want to meet people, it really depends on just what you're into. If you're an outgoing person and like to meet a lot of new people, you can try like a pub or a bar, maybe even a club if that's your thing. If you like to stay inside and like to play video games, try playing a game that has matchmaking. I don't know what kind of games you are into, but you can talk to people that you're matchmade with. They're playing the same game as you, which means they probably have similar interests.  If you're looking for a romantic relationship, there's always online dating services that you can use. A lot of people look down on that and talk about how they would never use them, but there's honestly nothing shameful about it. I'd encourage anybody to take advantage of those services.   There's lots of ways to meet people. If none of those options appeal to you, there's always other ways. It would help to know a little about you and what you're into.  Stay strong, friend."

Also i have a random job,but no ""serious"" job in sight...Dropped out of college after 3 semesters. I really lag behind... But chin up,you're only 20. Still lots of time for you to change something.I also try. Discover new sports and hobbies.That's my way of not thinking about how fucked up my life is.And it works quite well most of the time and gives me some self-confidence and new energy and resources to get things into a better direction.  For meeting new people i find sports clubs quite useful.I'm in an alpinist association.They doing trips into the mountains and stuff. But dont know where you live and what kind of things your region is offering. For myself i can say, that it helped when i moved from village to city and started to live in shared flats. Living in a shared flat is cheap and when you're lucky, you can find friends there or at least people you can hang out with when you're at home. It helped me to learn to manage my day and to discover new things i like and to take part in courses my city offers. But i still somehow have no hope that someday i will live a more of less happy life. BUT: I made a silent contract with myself.Maybe it's an idea for you too. I also often think of suicide and i also already know how i would do it. But i promised to myself not to do it untill i'm 40 years old. I'm a rational person and i know, that there's still hope that things can become better. So i give myself and my life the chance. I give myself 16 more years. I wrote my contract down.And i wrote my suicide thoughts down.I mean, everything that makes me wishing to die. And when I'm 40, and i still hate to be alive and wish to never have been born, then i allow myself to make the final step. I know how it feels like to be alone.To have not many friends and to have no real job perspective.I know how it feels like when no one is interested in you as a partner.I know how it feels like when your body craves for some body contact, cos the last time you've cuddled is a so long time ago,that you hardly remember... I know how it feels like when you cannot sleep at night,cos you have to think about all this shit and feel so desperate and crappy, that you just want to never wake up in the morning.  I won't tell you that life is super-duper and all will be ok in the end, that would be a lie. But you're still quite young and things can change into a better direction. So still keep up a couple of years. Save some money and travel around. When you live in the US, try to discover Europe. Maybe it's easier there to find different lifestyles.Somehow life in the US sounds very exhausting when it comes to the money part and health insurance and all that. Try couchsurfing. https://www.couchsurfing.com/ It's always good for meeting new people.They also have couchsurfing meetings or you can find people there for doing activities together. If you need a place in europe:i'm there:). Life is absurd, so don't take it too seriously. I'm a big fan of Albert Camus. Maybe you should read it.It helped me to lose my fear of life a bit more.

I really know what you mean with ""bitter person"". I have to take care not to become too misanthropic. When i notice i fall into such a depressive phase, i need to intervene quickly. Distract myself from thinking too much about relationships is really important.But yeah,it's difficult. I have weeks where i cry everyday.And then there are times when i develop a oh-fuck-it-attitude and be really busy with my things.  But hey.you're still 20. For a man that's somehow normal.Usually boys need a bit longer for their first relationship. At least from what i have noticed here.That's a poor consolation i know... It's too late for something better. I experienced that i made the most improvements when traveling. Somehow guys seemed to find it interesting.For me a completely surprising experience..

She may not remember much of you now, but in time she will be curious about her father. Having a father around, even a distant one who you ddont know too well, can be a massive influence on a life.  For another, if you are hoping the anti-depressants will work, it takes time! I hope your doctor explained this, but it can take a few weeks and some different combinations until it works for you. So speak with him again, after a few weeks if your meds aren't working.  I think getting through 60k of debt is showing something already. It takes a lot of work and strength to pull out of a financial hole. That kind of experience can do a lot for your self-esteem. And your girlfriend obviously sees something in you, despite the debt and the negativity.   If you feel negative around her, try asking her a bit more about her life. Get some other thoughts flowing between you. Or get out and do stuff together where you can try to leave your thoughts behind for a bit.  As for the work colleagues, people don't know how to respond to depression too well. at least not most of them. But people do understand that you're going through a tough time. If you show up to work again I'm sure people will welcome you back and be quite kind. They probably just don't know what to say/if they should say anything."

Or they could choose to just die quickly, why would they not just choos the second option?

Look at how many different things you've tried to help yourself! You are strong and brave. Please don't forget that.   I have been in a similar place you are right now. I have days where I think I should end things too because I've tried so hard and things still suck and I feel like I'm burdening others because of my issues. It took me a long time to find a therapist who got me and who took the time to really listen and understand why I was feeling the way I am and why I having the thoughts I have. If the therapist you are/were seeing isn't helping you then you owe it to yourself and you deserve to find someone who can help you. Please don't give up on talking to someone because a therapist or two, or more, hasn't helped yet. Keep searching until you find one who will. I know it's a terrible process having to retell your situation and story each time over and over again to a new doctor but for me, it was worth it when I finally found a doctor who fit with me.  As far as friends go... I've lost loads of friends because they couldn't relate to how I was feeling and what I was going through. Some of them even judged me and said awful things. It was incredibly painful at the time but now, looking back, I realize that maybe those weren't the people who should've been in my life the first place. You deserve to have friends who will stick by your side through thick and thin. Through the good, the bad, and the ugly. Everyone deserves that. Please reach out on here, like you're doing now, for people who will listen and talk to you. There are also a ton of groups and forums online you can join as well. Maybe, if you'd like, you can research in-person support groups for people who are going through a similarly rough time as you too.  Please don't stop fighting. You are a strong, brave, and beautiful warrior. If you need anything or would like to talk more, please feel free to message me. Sending strength and support your way!"

I'd call/text her and tell you're struggling with some things in your life right now, and ask her if you can get together and talk in person. Do it in a relaxed environment.

SuicideWatch,3d93nq,sixseveneightoh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"Fulfilling your goals just to ensure you do before you die isn't really the best advice. Ideally, you should be fulfilling them anyway, or at least, identifying them. You don't have to find something that makes you happy; you can even find something that makes you active and motivated. Or, something that makes you angry, or sad, if you like.  When it comes to a financial problem, you are quite right - two individuals with two separate financial problems are probably not going to be of much use to each other. However, with an emotional problem, it's possible to share the experience and see it not as two individual negative experiences, but as one with two people. This can make things a lot more easy to deal with.   If you don't want to be happy, that's okay. A lot of people do not want to be happy, will remain unhappy, and that's fine. The world has an abundance of unhappiness to offer, and if you want, you can explore this. Did you use to have any particular interests? Do you feel confident enough to try different things?"

Two oxycontin are NOT going to cause what happened to him. I am more concerned with his Valium prescription. You already mentioned that he had taken multiple. This is not safe. This is the part that jumps out as a red flag. If anything I think your friend caused his own issues with the valium he took.    Of course your parents are going to react the way they did and tell you that you are not allowed to see him again. They are trying to look out for your best interest. I will tell you this though: Parent's change their mind. It happens all the time. They are stressed now with the situation and this is the only logical solution to them. I can vouch for this because I once took Acid with my best friends and nearly burnt their house down. We were NEVER allowed to see each other again. Forbidden. Not even a few months later and I was back over at their house again hanging out with my best friends. Give it time OP. We are here to talk if you need anything.

If you have done something bad in the past, but can recognize that you did something wrong and feel bad about it and avoid doing it again, you can't be a horrible person even if you have done horrible things.  Therapy doesn't always work the first time around. All it takes is one problem that wasn't fixed to have everything fall back down again. Hopefully this time it will work out.

I was actually inpatient at a hospital at the time too, luckily I did get help. I think that if it interferes with your daily life, then it's worth getting help for, and to me it sounds like after 15 years it's time. Of course, it's always your choice in the end. Stay safe!"

I have no desire I can see for the 'American Dream' sort of stuff: kids, cars, pets, house, wife, career, hard-work --> riches, etc. The way I see it, Life has much to offer those who adopted the customs, culture, and expectations of the 'average' person.

If you are a true Nihilist you won't care what the response is. Be classy and tasteful while doing this tho, this way you don't get branded a street harasser or PUA or whatever.

Suffice it to say, it's given me pause and made me laugh sometimes at the 'nice guys finish last' neckbeard-types. My libido is that of a rock, entirely satisfied by masturbating once every three or four days.  If an entirely willing, forward, and compatible woman fell into my lap, I can't say I'd pass it up, if only because it'd be awkward not to. But I feel little if any compulsion to... seek it out, especially because I think I'd rather not trouble a woman with my issues at the moment.  Frankly, there's not a day goes by that I don't eventually fall into the abyss and have those eyes gaze back at me. As I said, the void beckons to me. My latent death wish becomes overt, at times."

Everyone is too busy.. and those that aren't couldn't be near if they tried.  Normally I give everything I am to my friends. But recently I found out my best friend referred to me as a puppy who is annoying and follows her around. I've been told i was a ghost who followed someone around once when I was younger.. and it's spurred this uncontrollable desire to ball my eyes out and consider all these sharp objects.  But I balk at everything that suicide stands for, or self mutilation.. yet it won't stop battering at my head.  8-10 scared for myself, but too scared to actually do anything.

I have people I can talk to, but it's hard to feel safe when there's an emotional investment.   Suicidal thoughts are weird, aren't they. For me, at least, there's a strange comfort being able to look over and see a door to an exit. To hold the knob and think about turning it. I don't have religion or belief that I would in any ""survive"" my own death, so the simple cessation of all I perceive forever and ever weighed against my current problems and fears softens them slightly. Only then do I really turn away from the door.   I don't know you, in all likelihood I never will, but I'm thinking of you, and I honestly wish you well on your path through life. Maybe from time to time, we'll think of each other and find a bit of solace in this thin thread that was established in July of 2015.   Stay safe. Shoot me a PM if you ever find the need."

You sound pretty hard-working and effective: depending on what state you're in (I'm just assuming US here, sorry if I'm wrong) you may be able to get emancipated at 17. If you can do that, you can almost certainly get some government assistance to help out with rent/bills. I know it can feel weird getting ""handouts,"" but the whole reason we have these systems in place is for people like you. You shouldn't have to go through what you're going through. No one should. Please see what options you have to get out of this situation!  I know your schooling situation sucks, but as long as you're willing to put a bit of work into it, you can make it work.

SuicideWatch,3d761t,Multiple_Mike,3,Tue Jul 14 01:27:01 2015 UTC,your 13 far to young to be trying to worry about the worlds problems Im sorry you feel unloved we all have and while I can't assume I know your situation a can suggest you try sharing some of your feelings with them. Times are hard no doubt and getting harder but people have not only survived worst but flourished. I was a pretty messed up kid grew up in a broken home with very abusive parents tried suicide more than once. And I'm so glad now that I failed at taking my own life that I have children and a family of my own. It's not easy to learn how to parent or be a functional emotionally positive person when you grow up like I did. But It's worth it our oldest is almost your age and he's shaping up to be good man. Sure we don't have everything we want but we always manage to scrape by. And Im far from perfect but unlike most parents I know how much it matters just to be there to be supportive without being abusive.  We're not all so lucky but if you can't turn to your parents there are other avenues to get help. Without resorting to a suicide attempt like I did. If you need any help finding them or just someone to vent at reddits here 24/7.

He's got a nice office job now and he didn't have these skills for his work when he started. He learned by doing the work and from the stories he told me, he's fucked up a lot. But he told me that fucking up is THE learning process.  I wish you don't look at yourself so harshly. I used to be a fat loser -- I'm still pretty chunky and kind of loserish but I've improved.

My advice to you is to face the problem rather than do something drastic, there is a solution that is better than ending your life because you work for a dick.  Fill out a chit to R/R a scheduled meeting with the CMC, make sure you  keep a copy for yourself and have someone you trust witness you signing and dating it.  This chit can be denied but it must be advanced thru the chain of command until it gets to the CMC.  You will get a chance to speak to the CMC, his job is the well being of the enlisted crew.  Take the time to put on paper what your problems with your job are, also possible solutions.  This is a move that will may get you some unwanted attention, but if you are at this point I think it is justified.  I spent 21 years in the Navy and I find it hard to believe that they cant find someone to switch jobs with you within the junior ranks of the hospital, i just think the right people haven't heard your problem.

SuicideWatch,3d5jad,unknown080,2,Mon Jul 13 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just want you to know that your life is so worth it. You're in medical school? That's amazing. Think of how many lives you'll impact for the better. Think of how dedicated and intelligent you must be to even get into medical school. I understand loving someone so much that your whole world revolves around them and you just want to make them happy. Sometimes when that person leaves, you feel empty or without a purpose. But just remember, you're you, not theirs. You were a wonderful, intelligent person before you met them and, hey you still are. For me, talking to a therapist helped whenever I couldn't get over someone. Alternatively, friends or family. If none of these are options, you can always PM me. I'm by no means an expert but I'd love to talk with you. I can tell from what you wrote that you're articulate, intelligent, compassionate, and wonderful. The worlds not finished with you yet. Hang in there :)"

Do you think that the awkwardness you feel staying with family has more to do with their words and actions, or more to do with how you feel like they must feel about you? I think that would really make a difference in whether moving would help.  Did you and your pup have a good walk? My dog is running back and forth on the deck, fretting about the baby turkeys going by."
SuicideWatch,3d69rt,syslinkdown,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:27 2015 UTC,"I feel it's their words and actions, I get the vibe that I'm not wanted, people talking down to me, hinting at me to stay at my girlfriends, sometimes they don't even talk to me, on more than one occasion in the past year, I've slept in my car (It's declared off the round, so I can't drive it anywhere) just so I can get out of the house. I'm not sure how to change that mentality though, my mum is one of those people who finds it easier to look the other way, my dad is one of the most insensitive people I've ever come across, and my brothers.. well.. I wouldn't consider them brothers, we just so happen to share the same parents. I spent many, many nights crying myself to sleep as a child wondering what I've done to deserve such a life with what my brothers had done to me.  If I could stick in the area though I'd like that, my girlfriend has been my complete focus lately, I've been finding it so difficult to do even the basics, shower, shave, etc, but she's been the reason I try to maintain some form of normality in my life. I'm just not sure how to break free from the negativity that is my family without a job, or just packing up and hoping for the best.  The walk was great though thanks :), she's roughly 14, german shepherd, you wouldn't believe it though by how excited she gets when it comes to walks, she still has that puppy energy inside her that only comes out when she see's her lead.   Thanks for the reply though.  Sorry, baby turkeys?"

Sorry about the shit brothers. Some people reassure themselves of their own worth by tormenting those they see as vulnerable. Obviously I have no absolute answers, but if the days you spend at your family's house are significantly worse than the ones you don't, a change of setting might really help. It's good to hear that your girlfriend is a beacon of light in all this. Just having someone else remember that you're a person with feelings and needs can help so much.   Sorry, baby turkeys?   Oh! I live in the US where these ridiculous things live, and my neighborhood is full of them. It's the time of year where the babies are old enough to start wandering around with their moms eating bugs. Kinda cute, but the noises they make are way unsettling."
SuicideWatch,3d69rt,syslinkdown,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"(I have no idea what that means. Non-drivable somehow?)   Ah sorry, it's meant to be ""off the road"". I couldn't afford road tax, or insurance, if your vehicle isn't taxed, to avoid a charge you have to declare your car to the DVLA as off the road. I believe it's so if the police run my plates while it's parked up and it comes back as having no tax or insurance, I won't be fined.  She's definitely a keeper. She's been through a lot in her life, she beat agoraphobia, and she's currently battling body dis-morphia disease, yet she's still the most amazing person I've ever met, she's already dragged me out of my social anxiety more than I ever could have imagined. It's incredible knowing she's right next to me when I feel down, or anxious, or scared etc. I got really lucky finding her.  In relation to the family, it's difficult, it is getting the point where if I have to come round for food, water, or clothes, and I see any of their cars outside, I instantly dread going inside and feel like turning around from where ever I came from and just not going inside. It's not supposed to be that way, but it is, I don't even know if they know that's how I feel, despite telling my mum countless times.  Those baby turkeys look adorable, although just by looking at them I can only imagine just how high pitched, loud, and consistent their voices probably are."

I have full blown panic attacks, can't write, can't work on art, can't... just can't.  The one thing that has helped me more than the anti depressants is adderall, and a very low dosage (5-10 mg).

SuicideWatch,3d4p1j,Middygal,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:13 2015 UTC,"I can relate. All I did at my old office job is look up for sale farming properties, read articles about small farm holdings and read about others that made the transition to that kind of life just because I wanted so badly to escape from my day to day situation. I was like 26 too. The whole farm dream wasn't something I could afford for a very very long time or maybe never but it gave me small relief from the bolted down and suffocating weighty feeling of all the things around me like work and bills that became more of who I am than I wanted it to be. Then at some point when I got realistic about it, this escapist fantasy didn't work so I did some bad things and had similar thoughts to what you did.  But I think there are ways to take back control of your life besides escapism or even suicide.  It's really difficult to find engaging and meaningful work and sometimes the whole money issue doesn't allow us to transition careers or vocations too much but I really hope keep looking out there to see what other work is available.  I really liked studying culture industry, literature, and art theory and I thought this is all I wanted to do (besides the farm thing) but then I fell into a position where a family member convinced me to try out nursing. I thought I'd hate it but then I ended up really enjoying the work and the new way I got to relate to other human beings. I'm still studying this and doing a little work in the field but I got paid just enough and got just enough time to myself where I no longer felt enslaved but instead kind of privileged. It put me in a place to pursue all the stuff that I cared about and this put me in a new relationship with the world where it wasn't so much enslavement but a new kind of participation.  I'm just saying from my experience maybe trying out new work might be an option. It's not easy but there's opportunities out there that I never even knew I would enjoy or find meaning in and they helped me get out from a similar cage feeling you describe."

Sometimes it's hard because you don't want to scare the person away by asking a bunch of questions. It either makes them uncomfortable or they don't like remembering.  Sometimes people are willing to talk and I think that's when we can help the most. Some nights I wonder if the people I've talked to are still alive.

As far as not feeling your degree, I have to say that I also really loved my degree until I got depressed and then i didn't love anything. Sometimes, when we get in that dark place, doing things we love ironically makes us feel empty. Talking has always helped me.

If that job ends or is written terribly, it's time to finish that page and go to the next chapter. I think you're ready for a new chapter! What did you study in school---what excites you -- what are your skills? Would you be okay taking a job that pays the bills for a while even if it wouldn't fulfill you as an occupation?

Unless everyone in your family is a sociopath your suicide will catapult them into the same misery you find yourself in now. Except they'll have to suffer through it unless they decide to follow in your footsteps.  I'm not saying this to stop you. That's just the cold, hard truth of your decision. You will put a pain in their lives that will echo the one you are looking to escape.  There's no sacrifice here. Don't even kid yourself into believing you're some kind of martyr.

You don't get to make that call. He does and I'm sure he can speak for himself.  On the one hand there's agreement with the truth of the decision, of the unimaginable suffering his death would bring to his family, and on the other there's an argument that it would be an act of love. Duty, obligation, even honour. There could be a case for those. But love? How does inflicting a lifetime of brutal pain on family and friends reflect love? Or can how he ""constitutes love"" expand to include even that?"
SuicideWatch,3d5ibf,lookingatwashington,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:59:38 2015 UTC,We'll have to agree to disagree on how we conceive of love.   Taking a bullet in the heat of the moment is not parallel to planned suicide. There are many much smaller sacrifices that could be made by all parties to spare the OP his life.   If OP believe his idea is good he should feel free to share it with his family so they can all arrive at a consensus and say their final farewells before he departs this life. That seems only fair to them.

SuicideWatch,3d4h11,Ettulife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:20:44 2015 UTC,"Call them and try to come to some sort of agreement. £10 a week or something. Try to be reasonable. If they want more, then there's nothing you can do, it goes to collections. This is when you are going to pay more thanks to fees and interest etc. but again you can still negotiate at this point. I've worked in credit control for car insurance and what happens is that the organisation (in this case the bank) will literally sell the debt to a collections agency, but people still pay back their debt at tiny amounts £5 a month because that was all they could afford, this is better for all parties because they are not having to chase you up. If you can't afford £10 a week now to the bank then tell them to go fuck themselves until you have the money and go from there when you get the money. Once you have the money, pay off as much of the debt as you can afford. £245 is not too bad you could clear that in several weeks working in a supermarket or whatever. No the credit score will not destroy your life. You have to come out of camerons' asshole if you want a good credit score at 18/19. It is bad news if you try to hide from it. I've seen peoples' debts go crazy because they weren't paying them back and were just running from it. Try to get advice on budgeting. No the correct advice is not to kill yourself! Yes they will try to panic you into paying with red letters but if you can't then you can't it is that simple."

If the bank aren't going to accept £5 a week or so then there is nothing you can do. If you get collections letters, ring them up immediately and try to come to a deal. Sometimes in some situations, debt can be written off but it really depends. When this is over you can talk to your bank about an 'arranged overdraft'. I got one when I was a student (32 now) and it's worth £1,200. If you become a student you can also approach your bank for a student overdraft and you do not have to give it up later with most banks. Of course not now as you owe them money! Go in and speak to them if you like they are there to provide you with a service. Well done and all the best"

But, if it's worth anything, remember that we are all slaves here, and we can only do what we can. So, dont be too too condemning of yourself. ... I dont know. ... I'm sorry.  ...

SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,SkepticalRealist,2,Mon Jul 13 06:06:00 2015 UTC,"Can relate... when I was a kid I never thought I'd see adulthood. Couldn't make out long term goals because I was certain I'd not live that long... lived that long.  Became adult, was certain I'd not live long enough to get married.. I did. I got old enough and got married. I lived that long.  Was convinced I'd not live to be 40... life went on and boom... I was 40. I lived that long.  After I lived that long, I was certain I'd never live to be as old as my mom when she died.. passed her age at death last year.. am now old as fuck.  Then I was certain I'd not make it to my 50th birthday. I'm 49 now so crossing fingers.  Not saying this to mock you in anyway, just that I can relate to always feeling this way. Sometimes there is no 'happy ending' for people, and they just live horrible unhappy lives. I've come to embrace it, and whatever happens, happens.   I'm sure you deserve a lifeforce OP, you just don't see it, but I'm sure others do."
SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,shadow_catt,4,Mon Jul 13 05:57:21 2015 UTC,"I created a Reddit account for the first time in my life specifically to say something here.  I went through a protracted period of being suicidal and not seeing the point in living. It wasn't articulated half as well in my head as what you've said here, but the general thrust of it was similar.   Eventually I just kind of slid out of it. I'm still not sure why or how that happened. I only know that while I still wrestle with depression and anxiety and the ""what if it all means nothing?"" thoughts, I'm glad I stuck around. I would have missed out on some good stuff if I'd made the decision not to.   But I know it doesn't work that way for everyone. Clearly you've given this a lot of thought, and you understand what you feel and why better than most people do.  I will say this: if your writing is any indication of who you are as a person, then you're intelligent, thoughtful, and I'd be willing to bet you're a very good friend. Please consider rethinking the ""removing yourself from the lives of the people you've grown close to"" side of things.   I understand the desire to ease out of their lives comes from a place of empathy, from only wanting to spare them the pain of losing you, but as someone who's lost a friend or two over the years to suicide (and a few more to other dark places), I can tell you as much as it hurts to lose someone that way and to wonder what you might have been able to do to prevent it (the answer to that question, of course, is usually ""nothing""), if given the choice to have less time with them or to have them take on a lesser, more distant role in my life in exchange for not feeling the loss of them so completely, I would choose to have them in my life for as long as possible. Every single time. Pain be damned.  Trust me on this. The people who love you won't love you less or wish you'd gone away before you really went away in order to spare them some pain. They'll be grateful for the time they had with you, and grateful you cared about them enough to stay for as long as you did."
SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,CartilageWheel,2,Mon Jul 13 10:34:59 2015 UTC,"It seems like you haven't found what you enjoy and what gives you happiness at least for now. If you could do anything and get paid what would it be? Maybe writing would be good, your writing is very thoughtful. Alas, you have summed up the human condition. Lots struggle against the depressing reality that you speak of. It's natural for you to feel like that in the meaningless rat race you have described. Is that really a reason to exit the world? You don't know what's on the other side. It could be nothing....is nothing and non existence really better? After all you wouldn't get to ponder things, etc. You are not worthless and your existence does matter and makes an impact, even your post, as thoughtful as it was. There are so many people I see who hate their lives and their jobs, and you are a voice for them, and lots of people, not just yourself. It may seem that some are really happy and maybe they do find happiness and enjoyment, and you deserve that too."
SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,RRhinoReason,2,Mon Jul 13 02:41:45 2015 UTC,"But I have. I know what I enjoy and what gives me happiness. I love to party, go traveling, listen to live music, hang out in the sun, swim, paint, play videogames. The problem is that I can't just do those things. The problem is, I want to just have fun but I don't want to work for it. I don't want to sit in an office 40 hours a week just to have a few tired hours of freedom. I'm inherently lazy, naive, childish and unmotivated. But telling that to anyone will result in ""oh but thats not realistic"" or ""but thats not how the world works"" and I know that, and that's what depresses the hell out of me. That it's just work and bullshit and a little bit of fun in between. To me, the little bit of fun doesn't make up for all the bullshit, not even close. I mean it with all my heart, all my honesty, when I say that I would rather just die than live the kind of life everyone else lives. Hell, I should be looking for a job right now because I'm broke and can't even afford next month's rent let alone food. Actually I'm head over heels in debt because I'm constantly spending money I don't have just to do things I actually enjoy. But just the idea of having a job, a responsibility that I have to go to every single day, it's so incredibly depressing and the more my family and friends try to pressure/encourage me into sending out applications, the more I fantasize about quietly offing myself in the peace and silence of my apartment. Because life is shitty and hard and long and boring. Death is easy. Death is death. There is nothing after that. And nothing sounds so, so comforting."
SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,RRhinoReason,3,Mon Jul 13 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"The idea of adding value is what gives life meaning. So what do you have to add value? You could do anything that has to do with the things that you love, partying, hanging out in the sun, swimming, painting, and videogames. Adding value would give you drive and enthusiasm. You can start by asking the people who value you. Do you value me? and What do you value about me? Your friends and family would answer for you. It could be simple but at least that is value. On the other hand, living to enjoy transient pleasures really doesn't add value, even if they are enjoyable in the moment. Of course people have jobs where they aren't appreciated so they need to find a place where their value is appreciated too.  Instead of saying that you should look for a job, acknowledge that you have choices. As long as you are able, you still have a choice whether to be ""lazy"" or ""unmotivated"". Simoly starting a project like cleaning and organizing your closet will be an excellent way to get in the mood of ""motivation"" and ""a job well done"". That is what life is all about. Work is play for grownups.  I bet once you got a job you might begin to feel differently. Why not try? Try to be self sufficient, responsible, add value, etc. and be kind to yourself. Remember that you have choices so it really isn't logical for you to say nothing is better than never even having the chance at doing anything again, never having the chance to feel joy in being responsible, never having the chance to feel motivated, etc.  Do one little thing. Clean a closet. Rate it from one to ten how enjoyable it was. Take a shower. Rate it from one to ten. Make a good meal. Rate it from one to ten on enjoyment. Send a resume. Rate it on one to ten on enjoyment. Go to an interview. Rate it on one to ten on enjoyment. And then rate all the other activities on enjoyment that you already mentioned. You might be surprised and show yourself that ""work"" or ""boring"" activities are actually enjoyable for you, you just don't realize it because you are stuck in a pattern of thinking. You do have choices and is choosing to deny yourself any chance of enjoyment really better than nothing? OF COURSE NOT!   I bet you would be really surprised at how much better you feel once you start working. At least starting on those things will set you in a new direction of enthusiasm. Comfort comes from having security, a plan, knowing you are capable and can care for yourself."
SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,EllietheWalrus,2,Mon Jul 13 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"I used to think like this a lot. What makes me special enough for live, when there are others more deserving to live, right?  But then I started thinking some more.  I will never know why I was put on this earth. I will probably never know why any of us are here. But I'm alive now.  Others didn't get the chance. Maybe one of those people who didn't get a chance to live was gonna cure cancer, or do something important with their life.  I realized then that I shouldn't detest my own life. I shouldn't feel ashamed because I have enough to eat and others don't, or because I have a house or a bed or my parents. Instead, I should honor those who didn't have any of those things and live my life in a way that would make them proud.  I would live my life not full of hate for myself. I would live for those who couldn't. And so, I would live to make the world better.   I’m just trying to sing a different tune And then fit into a world that didn’t have room for me  -watsky   I realize this sounds very cheesy. But I lost my friend to suicide, and I considered it myself at some point. This is also how I chose to honor her. I haven't had much time, but if I can talk to someone who's suicidal and help them out, I'm happy with that."
SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,lyfe19,4,Mon Jul 13 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Oh my god.. Every word you just said is exactly the same way I feel. Ok first of all, I just graduated too, I have/ had no interest in living, and I've got the same plan as you to end my life. I absolutely hate that I'm a person, I hate that I speak, breathe, and eat. I have good friends and family, so I feel guilty that I feel like this for being so privileged. On one of my many nights of pacing around my room for hours just thinking, I had one weird thought run through my head that I wrote down and I tell it to myself almost everyday. Here it is:  ""I am not on this planet for myself. I am not living for myself, I am solely living for other people. If I were living for myself I would've been dead by now. If it were up to me, I would've ended it all. But, it's not up to me. I am living for others who care about me, just as they are living for me. If I were to kill myself then I would be killing a part of everyone else. Life shouldn't be about the self, but about everyone else involved with the self.""  You're right. Life is meaningless. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. One thing that's made me feel better about living, and this kind of sucks, but I started hanging out with other depressed people and I've started trying to help people that are going through the same thoughts as me. Again, I'm in the same boat as you. But would you really want me to kill myself? What would you say to me? Whatever it is that you might say, say it to yourself as well. Why should you kill yourself, but I shouldn't? I don't think we're very different, it's just something to think about..."
SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,forevev,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"As a person with this frame of mind I would never try to convince a person who truly did not want to be alive to stay alive. It's not fair, especially if I'm feeling their perspective as hard as I am right now.   The most I would do is sit and listen to them if they gave out a cry for help. I am personally indifferent to the outcome of the situation because I understand it from both sides so deeply. I would encourage a person to say how they are feeling, and I have been in this situation a few times and each time, the person themselves comes up with the conclusion that they don't actually want to die, so they haven't gone through with it and are happier now. I have never once told a person who came to me with suicidal thoughts to not commit suicide. I have also never told a person who came to me with suicidal thoughts to commit suicide. I have no authority over what an individual does to their own body. In each case that I have experienced however, the person always had some sort of trauma they felt they just couldn't live with. A rape, abuse, financial crisis, addiction, no friends, something like that. In most cases, people in their most desperate come to terms with these traumas, let go, and realize they want to experience life and become successful. And you know, good for them. If talking to me about their issues helps them find a desire to be alive, that's awesome. I'm truly happy for them and I wish them all the best.   I am not for or against either position on this matter. I just understand both."

My parents know nothing of my problems, and they've always tried as best as they could for me to have a good life. So whilst they live, I shall to. The moment they die, if I feel the same way- I will leave this life. My friends will be hurt by this decision, and yes it is cruel of me to do this- but I also feel it is cruel of them if they want me to live merely for there own happiness.

I'm so conflicted as to whether I should stop talking to my friends now. Back then, I never thought I'd graduate from high school. I was so sure the stress of it will kill me - there were times when they almost did. I'm going to start college in a few weeks now, and I know that one day, when I've properly distanced myself from everyone, I will do it.   But I have also been considering another option - running away. Idk if it will interest you too. But if I'm going to die, I might as well go missing first. I will be dead to the eyes of families and friends, to the eyes of the law. Try going to every prohibited area, try surviving in the wild, meet tribes and wrestle some wild beasts. If I die of poisoned flowers, or a scratch or a bite or hunger, at least no one's going to blame themselves for my death. It will be obvious that it was from my own stupidity.   It'll also give me time to think. If I change my mind, I can always come back to civilization. This is the best alternative I can find. Good luck to us both, friend."

I mean I'll probably get killed in no time as I have no survival skills, people skills or any other skills for that matter, but hey, at least the people in my life won't be left behind in the turmoil of a suicide?"

SuicideWatch,3d2ee7,DreamingMerc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:18:24 2015 UTC,"I am having these exact thoughts right now. I have been for the last year. Last week, these thoughts are what brought me to this subreddit - to see if maybe somebody else here feels similar.   Last week a friend of mine committed suicide. Every single one of our mutual friends was deeply saddened by this, and as much as I feel some sadness for the people who consider this to be a horrible tragedy, apart from that I felt nothing but envy for her.  I have been looking through posts every single day since then, and I realized that everybody else has so many problems. Up until now I hadn't seen a post that was relative to how I am feeling at all. Everyone seems to have experienced abuse of some sort, a disability, an illness, the loss of a friend or partner - JUST SOMETHING, that attributes to their lives being completely miserable. I feel very bad. I feel genuinely selfish and horrible, because I have no problems. I am hilarious. I'm intelligent. I am empathetic, kind, compassionate. I have a great job and enough money to spend on the things I like. My family was never abusive. I have always been great at making friends anywhere I go. I can put in minimal effort and excel at everything I do. I have never failed at anything.   I just can't shake this feeling of unjust obligation to life. It's absolutely ridiculous to me that I can't just simply exist. Somehow, I have to justify my life by working and contributing to a society that I had absolutely no control over being involved in. I never asked to be born, and if I ever had the option, knowing the stipulations that accompany life inside civilization and on this planet, I would have passed.   I have absolutely no desire to keep living at this present time, but the social obligation I'm under to stay alive floods me with an atrocious amount of guilt. I know that when I die, I won't be able to feel guilt for my actions. I'll be dead. I will feel nothing. But my consciousness while alive eats at me, knowing that even though I won't get to see their faces, even though I will feel nothing, a lot of people will be horribly affected by this. I don't know what to do."
SuicideWatch,3d3ptf,WilliamTheGnome,5,Mon Jul 13 07:28:20 2015 UTC,"To address your welfare concern, I used to be on welfare with my mother back in 2004. We learned English and she used all of her income to pay for a small apartment along with clothes for me and my brothers.  We are no longer on welfare.   We were on it for a few years, but my mother went back to school and secured a better-paying job while teaching herself English. If we didn't have the food stamps, we definitely would not have been able to eat. We would have had to move back to Syria, and i don't know if I would have been able to respond to your post because I probably would not have been alive give IS's control over northern Syria (where we probably would have moved).  In the meantime, I have started a small non-profit, delivered a few speeches on my experiences in the U.S., and helped people who were in my position that are now helping people who were in their position. I will continue to do all of this and more when I attend Yale College in the next 4 years.  I know you sacrifice a lot for welfare and unemployment, and some of that is unfortunately taken for granted by some individuals..  but in a way, your working effort made my existence here possible. To know that people like you, who work day in and day out, support my family fills me with a sense of appreciation and gratitude with which I don't think I will ever be able to repay you enough.  You technically saved me. I don't want to argue semantics behind tax flow and everything, but the way I see it, I wouldn't be here without you.   So thank you.

I can't remember where or why I saw these numbers but I want to say it accounts for less than 5% of all welfare and social security payments.   But I know that's just some random words at this point. Someone else shared their story so I will add mine. When I was 12 my dad died of cancer, and shortly thereafter mom went into organ failure and could not work. I had a brother three years older, but other than that, no family or friends to help take care of us (short story on that is the extended family never wanted me or brother or mom).   Anyway, so my mom went through her local Social Security offices to find any money for my brother and I to basically live. We didn't do much, just clean clothes once a year and food on the table.   Years would pass before anything would become even vaguely normal. But the outcome is the same, we no longer require social security  funding. My brother works is hospital administration,  I work in wireless design. Those little dollar values at the end of all our checks made that possible. As it does for a lot of other people.   Past that, I'm sorry it feels like a never ending shit tunnel. I can only imagine how you must feel.   I don't know what you really like to do in whatever free time you have. But you sound like you're in a similar age bracket as me, or I guess, and I play the hell out of video games.

I've noticed that this is a repeated tactic- ""oh that was just a mistake, you know I have anxiety etc"".  I mean the things that have done are beyond f-ed up.  I've even questioned whether my parents took me and my brother from another family since we look nothing like them at all(they have dark skin, we have light skin) and from our earliest memories we called them by their full 1st names vs calling them Mom and Dad.

No one in their right mind could ever think it was a mistake, especially when the person verbally threatened me afterwards, but this is the tactic they use consistently and I don't know how to beat it.    They realize I don't have any friends, when this abuse started my father said ""Well you don't have any more friends now do you?"" And gave me a malevolent look.  Whenever I complain about their treatment, they threaten to leave and not come back, classic abuse of a dependent person.  I've even begun to wonder whether they are actually my parents at all. I look nothing like them, when I was 3 years old, me and my bro called them by their first names Vs 'mom or dad., which is unheard of. They have a history of cult involvement they've withheld info on-- the cult mass marries everyone that belongs to it, yet they claim they never did this. Then when I was a bit older, they followed someone who channeled a spirit that went by the same name as a mythical character who sacrifices his son.

And yet they are the ones who tell everyone I yell at them.  .  They will pretend to be liberal in politics, my father repeatedly says that he is against war, but then he will come out strong on how he supports torture,even through he has read articles I've sent about how even if you don't care about the ethical dimension, it just doesn't work.   They've even tried to essentially politically assassinate me-- after 9/11, I made a big deal of rejecting torture and the war in Iraq, and while I've steadfastly denied I believe in a conspiracy on 9/1 I've said that there are very strange coincidences surrounding the event.  My loving family secretly stuffed my DVD collection full of these super sketchy conspiracy DVDs, trying to paint me as a whacked out conspiracy theorist.  Just keep in mind that these are people that portray themselves as liberals to everyone else they meet. It's just unbelievable."

You create happiness for people. Maybe right now you feel like no body will love you, but from the kindness you have shown to just random people on the internet, I think people in real life will have a hard time not liking you provided they get to know you.  Furthermore, I don't think that you'll never find love. I think you mentioned before on GOG that you are under 20, there is so much opportunity within the next few years. There are so many variables in life that making a statement like that is totally unfounded. I can barely say where in life I will be next year.   Anyways what I am trying to say that is your an awesome person who's extremely kind. Few people would spend over $250 in a single week buying people video games to make them happy. Maybe wait it out a little longer, find new supporting friends, get involved in some hobbies just for the sake of trying something new or having fun, and eventually people will get to know you and you will eventually find love.

Without you they would most likely not be able to experience the game they have come to love. If what I hear is correct you are in the prime of your life. The transition from High School is quite both a rough and puzzling time. If I might recommend try setting up a long term goal. I have to admit I was kinda lazy my high school year and this led to a great loss in possibilities that have could have otherwise shined brightly. By setting up a goal you can work at your own pace. If love is what you want then please continue to do what you do best on GoG.

I have been in troubled places in the past as well and have considered ending my life twice for different reasons (different from yours). But I can tell you one thing, if your main issue is with the fear of never finding love, it is nearly impossible to not love another human being when you really get to know them, especially those who are so kind. Get out there more, push your comfort zone, let people get to know you on a deep level, there are some activities that breeds those type of friendships."

I wish, right along with you, our society could give you a financially viable path to get it...

My previous work environment was absolutely TOXIC, and I had friends who would say ""just quit you don't deserve to be treated like that."" And it's SO EASY for them to say and do. Because we they quit their parents will cover the rent & utilities for a month or two until they can settle in a new job. If I quit without something already lined up I'm homeless.   Those are extreme examples but it trickles down to everything. I feel like everyone around me is happier because they've had an opportunity to just do what they wanted and not worry about the consequences and I never have.  I never partied in school because I was taking a full course load and working 30-40 hours a week. I've never just gotten in the car and driven three states away because if I broke down or ran out of money for gas I'd be stranded. I didn't get married and have babies when I was young & in love because it was too big a financial risk.   And the end result is that now at 29 I'm emotionally and socially stunted. I can't connect to people. Last week was my birthday and I didn't even have anyone to spend it with. I took myself out to eat at a nice restaurant alone."

I'm not a doctor so don't take this to be a diagnosis but depression can present itself at particular times to particular people as a lack of motivation. There's a lot of resources out there for depressed persons if this is the case.  And even if it isn't that, I really hope you give this world more chances. You wrote that you've been searching for a while but nothing inspires you anymore. I really believe that there are some incredible things out there in the world and I think that if you just sought out meaning, inspiration, happiness, etc. in new places you might find something that strikes your mind and emotions in the right way.  I don't think you should blame yourself that you're in this state. I know some great people that struggle with what you're describing here. But I think the key thing I took away from them is the idea of struggle. They work hard to keep themselves motivated and engaged with the world and it seems like it pays off for them.  I really hope you give the world a bit more of a chance and get out there and see at least a little more if it.

If I make eye contact with someone, I will talk until I run out of breath. I am trying to practice actually being aware of my own breath, and words when I am talking, but it is VERY hard. Part of the problem--and this sounds stupid--is that I have such a hard time breathing through my nose right now I can't speak while making eye contact and breathing.   You shouldn't have to come out of the closet. Being gay is not easy.   Write it out, and examine what you're accomplishing by hating yourself.

The last time I went to therapy I thought it was insanely stupid and tbh I'm thinking about canceling the appointment I've made. I had trouble not laughing at the things my therapist was saying. She wanted me to get in touch with my emotions or something. Every time I would tell her anything she wanted me to look ""deep inside myself"" and say how that experience made me feel. There is no deep inside me, and it would always make me laugh when she tried to get me to do that so I stopped going.

There IS a ""deep inside you"" and to most people if they've considered suicide. Don't get me wrong...at this stage I think about suicide inordinately because your feelings about yourself and dealing with people sound familiar. It's exhausting.   There is some part of you that feels like she can't control how people see her or engage with them in a meaningful way, something that makes speaking with them feel out of control (I get that...I do too). Most people ramble uncomfortably in conversation, whether it's with friends and just to fill up awkward pauses or meeting new people.   You shouldn't have to come out unless you want to but that's no one's business.   You might well have anxiety or social anxiety...there are reasons behind my own (acne and generally being an awkward, low energy  person).   No one manages anxiety perfectly and it's not just a mental disorder, per se, but a normal part of life (those emotions, anyway).  They will never be without conversations that don't feel horribly awkward or go through life without something they dislike about themselves. But they get to a place where they don't think about suicide-with therapy, with meditation (I'm serious about the breathing thing, or becoming aware of how you speak....I have to actively pause to take a breath and sometimes a quiet smile in the middle of a conversation counts for a lot), with medication.

SuicideWatch,3d2ttx,Mhk18,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:46:39 2015 UTC,"my second-to-last hospitalization a couple months ago was because a friend called the police on me. i remember just lying down for a nap and waking up to cops in my room and then being dragged off to the hospital yet again. it was humiliating and infuriating, especially because pretty much all my hospitalization experiences have been wholly unhelpful and even traumatic for me.   i just wanted to share that story in case it would help you to know that you're definitely not alone in having that experience, or feeling angry about it afterward. i have been able to spend time with that friend since then but even now i am still upset and wary around her. what she did dealt a huge blow to our friendship; i have basically no trust in her now and have not and will not talk about such intensely personal things with her again. it's ok to be angry with her, even while knowing that it's not her fault. that's a completely normal and understandable response. you can take as long as you need to work through your feelings about her; obviously i still haven't really come to terms with what my own friend did to me. you can even be angry forever if you want. you can choose not to speak to her ever again, or just for a really long time, and that's normal, and that's ok. it's definitely not fun to feel like your relationship with her is damaged, maybe irrevocably so, but there's nothing morally wrong with feeling that way."

SuicideWatch,3d3865,junkaccn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:08:13 2015 UTC,"I have a great amount of depression but have never been diagnosed nor do I want to be. I am of the mindset that I understand the issue and can deal with it.   I'll gladly help as I was in the same boat by using an analogy:  A man tells you that he has had a hard time seeing, most of his adult life in fact!  Things from a distance appear blurry but he doesn't want to go to an optometrist because he doesn't think they can help.  You would probably flip out on the guy, right?  Get to an optometrist to see if you glasses/contacts/lasik and get on with your new in focus life!  Well depression is a similar thing.  There's two aspects to it.     It messes with your current brain chemistry and makes you see the world in a distorted way.  It affects your motivation, mood, sleep, enjoyment of things, etc. It messes with your perception of yourself and by helpfully highlighting every mistake from every memory you think of while depressed.  As a bonus it also taints those memories*.   That's why medicine treats clinical depression with both medications (to take care of #1) and with therapy to help undo the ""brainwashing"" (#2) you've undergone through having the condition for an extended period of time.  Your life could be in focus, you just have to ask for help.  And trust me, right now you're probably fretting about the costs and the shame, but I tell you there is no shame and the costs end up meaning nothing compared to having your life put back into focus.  It may take a month or two, or half a year, but when you do get better you'll kick yourself for not getting the medical help you needed sooner.  *Current scientific understanding is that when memories are recalled, they are re-written and slightly changed."

Looking for things people have done that have helped them to come back down to a norm without being on a med.  I appreciate your opinion tho and have always looked at medication as being an option, its just not for me."
SuicideWatch,3d3865,AlwaysRinging,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:13:25 2015 UTC,"taking a pill to cover up things   Should you need meds, not saying you do, you're not ""taking a pill to cover up things"" just as much as someone with a broken leg isn't using a cast as a crutch.   If you have depression, the meds they prescribe you are to correct a physiological problem.  You have some choices:   Try the usual depression ""cures"" (diet, exercise, positive affirmation) Suck up your pride and see a doctor and see what they say. Continue living like this.      It sounds harsh but I've been through this.  Pride is what made me wait, pride is what made me waste precious time(and money, and friendships) to depression instead of getting healthy waaay sooner.    Seriously man,  I care.  Try the self help options and see if they work, it's definitely worth a shot and you lose nothing by exercising, eating on a well controlled diet (easing up sugars and such), getting a full 7.5 - 8 hours of sleep on a regular basis,  working on your thought process (affirming your worth to yourself, celebrating your accomplishments, and setting small and achievable goals and working on them - try downloading an app to record your goals).  In time you may pull out your current ""funk"".  But if after doing the above, you're still having the same thoughts?  Talk to your doctor next time you see them!  He or she will not judge you, they just want to help.  It's why they went to med school, to help people.  Does that sound reasonable?    Look I grew up thinking suicidal ideation was normal.  I remember as a freshman in high school peering over a ledge on the 3rd floor seriously wondering if I should just throw myself over because I got in trouble at school. I remember carrying similar thoughts all through college and figuring it was just normal to have such thoughts.  And I remember finally talking to a counselor and getting help, and about 8 months later after trying different meds and counseling, actually experiencing what it was like to feel normal.  I realized what it was to actually enjoy things, to not pull apart every experience tossing the good parts and just looking at the nugget of failure in every thing I had done.  And I remember feeling like a fool for not getting help sooner, because you know, pride.  Anyway keep an open mind and let me know how it goes!"

Ethics, the humane treatment of defenceless children, and social justice is much more important to me. As a mature person, I realise that it is folly to measure my social standing by how much money I have or what I own or who I connect with, or how many degrees I have.

I shuffled them and loaded one magazine into the rifle at a time, charged the rifle, aimed at my head and pulled the trigger. The 5th magazine had the round. I knew it was there. I couldn't pull the trigger. That night I took a LOT of sleeping pills, three different types. I felt my system ""drop"" as I fell asleep. Somehow, I woke up in the morning.

He and I talked for an hour about life, depression, and suicide. I went back once or twice a week for a number of months. It really helped. I don't know if there are any walk in clinics around you or not. I know this sub reddit is against bringing religion in, but if you walk into most churches, of any faith, the pastor will talk to you.

To me, all it takes is caring and kindness. He loves you because you showed him a reason not to kill himself. Being with you, or even just talking to you brings him joy in his life. You might not understand but as a depressed person myself who sometimes just wants to end it, I would love a opposite sex friend who would listen to me. It would just make me happy to see your face every day.  As for advice, I would recommend not removing yourself instantaneously. That would most assuredly make him regret EVER sharing his feelings with ANYONE shrink or not. If you don't love him that is okay but try to make him happy. And remember, your face, your presence, that is what makes him happy, not your body or your 'features' for less crude words. As for friends, try to make him go outside. Walks in the park would help or maybe just social gatherings, things that would force him to interact with the outside world.

Nothing that you did could have saved him from that point. As someone with depression, if he wanted to solve his depression, he would have gotten medical help. His reluctance to do so is his own doings. Their is something rather comforting about depression that I can't explain. I guess it is the feeling of... acceptance? I don't know. I just find peace in the emptiness that is in me. It's weird, it's the nothingness that that makes me happy yet sad. I don't know to be honest.  I hope you find a good solution to your problem but to me it sounds like he has made up his mind a long time ago. Now he is just waiting for the right moment.

Life has no meaning to it whatsoever. Its composed of many tiny pointless actions which we try to attribute meaning to, but, at the end of the day, those are meaningless as well.  You mentioned the whole fascade thing. Sooooo true. And I think that is exactly what fuels my depression. In order to get anything out of this world (well, legally or conventionally) you have to bullshit. You have to bullshit everything. Right now, I'm sitting in period 3, meant to be doing work, but I just can't. I literally cry when I try to. Why? Because school means nothing. Its bullshit. They reward conformity and punish creativity. Its a giant memory game which, in the end, destroys my deep seeded inner desire to learn. I hate it. Well I guess that isn't the same with you, you seem to like school.  As for my take on life, find something, something as small and stupid or insignificant, something which you take pleasure in, and just do it. I know its hard to find motivation to do anything, but deep down, there must be something that you like doing. Even if its playing video games, drawing, driving, anything. Anything to keep yourself from all the bullshit. I found myself a part time job at the moment and that has helped dramatically. Yes, the pay is shit and the work is just as shit as everything else, but at least it has real meaning. You are exchanging your time and effort for a reward (money) that is beneficial to you. That fact alone has given me the motivation to live another day. Its the only thing that's real if you know what I mean.   We are all fake man, all of us. It sucks.

That means two things to me.   Firstly, if everything is worthless than all things at least have equal worth. The position and existence of a single subatomic particle is just as important as the super massive black hole in the center of a galaxy or the gravitational forces of the lattice work of galactic formations that span our viewable universe. The argument could be made that everything does indeed have an objective worth because the removal of the smallest, meanest part of the universe would mean it is no longer the same universe. I don't agree because I assume that it would just be a slightly altered universe, I don't know if the integrity of existence hinges upon every little thing.  Secondly, there is still subjective worth. I can assign worth to anything I want. I can base worth on emotion, on data, on numbers, on whether or not I'm hungry. I have agency, or the appearance of, at least. Of course, the dimmer view is that this is the source of all human conflict and misery; people assign worth to mostly different things. I think, though, that it is interesting and that is the least I can say about worth. Worth has worth to me.  My life has a subjective meaning and worth (usually). I base it upon both transporting the particles that make up my body at any given time (we are conscious little protoplasmic pieces of the universe) and the reduction of pain in others and in myself. If I can reduce the pain of a cat or an ant or a person, I feel worth. Sometimes that also alleviates my own pain but admittedly it can increase it as well. However, I still find worth in it.  To conclude, I believe worth is only subjective, but I do not think objective worth trumps the subjective."

You can't trade it directly. Only your own self-reflection determines how much your life is worth to you. If you can identify what went wrong and reiterate, you will usually become happier, therefore your life is also worth more to you. I noticed that time is not really that short, therefore if my current challenges can be retried indefinitely, I will do so. I got my driving license in the 4th try, and in my 4th college retry I managed to clean a whole semester. I still have one semester and my degree paper to do but I'll get there eventually.  I acknowledged life is suffering therefore I'm not going to let it play me around the finger anymore. I'm just letting it pass, good or bad and I definitely feel more at ease. It is also incredibly painful to compare myself to others. I removed from my Facebook all everything I considered bragging : travelling pics, weddings, employment, etc.  To;Dr : the worth of your life to yourself (because there is no other worth) is based on self-reflection.

I've worked with a number of psychologists trying to get myself off a fairly guaranteed path to suicide, and they always seem to preach this idea, but it seems to me a desperate attempt to cling to life for no reason other than fear.  What other explanation could there be for ignoring the veritable mountain of horrible shit that life is filled with?  Does it make you feel better to just ignore it all and focus on a small amount of good things?  Sure, I bet it does.  But is that a life worth living?

I can definitely sympathize with the crushing feeling of being alone and depressed despite living in an advantageous position. I'm 20, born into a middle-class white family in the suburbs, you know the rest... but even then, I also have no friends (last one moved to San Diego), and I want nothing more than to die.   I know, logically, that depression doesn't discriminate between the privileged or the poor. And yet, I can't stop beating myself up for being unhappy despite everything I have going for me. Shitty feeling, right? You wouldn't say the same about someone with cancer who was born wealthy, but physical illness is something that society can easily accept as tangible and threatening, contrary to something like depression.  It probably won't mean much, and it certainly won't fix your situation, but it's not your fault. Your brain is an organ just like any other, and just those other organs, it can get sick. It's not something you can change through willpower or state of mind. There are treatments for it (therapy, meds, exercise, etc etc), but I'm going to assume you've already tried those. I sure as hell have.  And I just want to say, it's fucking impressive that you were able to graduate from a top-tier university and become eligible for a funded PhD position despite struggling with this. I barely graduated high school and haven't even started college yet - that's what a failure is. But I wouldn't even give it a second thought if I wasn't so alone. People tell you ""You don't need anyone else to be happy, look within!"", but it's all bullshit. Humans are social creatures after all, right?   Why remain in agony when action can be taken?   Can't answer that. It would be hypocritical of me to try and talk you out of it when I'm planning it myself. If you want to talk more I'll be more than willing to listen. You shouldn't have to spend what time you have left alone."

It seems you very much care about your relationships with people, and that's a good thing. Have you done your residency yet? I'd say actually practicing might be a great way to keep yourself busy and alleviate depressive symptoms. You're exercising and doing a hobby you enjoy, so that's a lot! Give yourself some credit, even though you might not think it's enough, it's a day to day process, so give it time. You just graduated medical school, after what I'm sure was a lot of hard work, there's no point in throwing that away. Now is a great opportunity for you to start fresh and meet new people. Looks like some doors are closing, but others will for sure open for you. I'm not the best when it comes to relationship advice, you might want to check out the sub-reddit for that.

It took me a long time to begin doing so. As arbitrary, as subjective, as my assignments of worth might be, it at least has proved  useful as earmuffs in the cold, howling shit storm that life appears to be.  I suspect that I struggle on because of many reasons: social conditioning, biology, hedonsim, and so on. I can't say I don't find that a little disgusting but at the same time, I can sometimes accept that.  We are constantly changing arrangements of particles that have the semblance of continuity. Nothing matters, in my opinion, except what we want to matter to us. It's the one instance, I think, where something is true because of belief in that thing.  Of course, I could be wrong, but then, that wouldn't matter.  I hope you can feel better. How we feel is something that has worth to me.  Edit: I don't mean to say that you're choosing how you're feeling or whether or not to feel suicidal. You're not.  It's also hard to say why other people fight you about your suicide without knowing those people but in my own experience it can be anything from social expectations, the fear of loss, to genuine concern."

As for morality, it closely ties to value theory, and value in general. Its basically the question of which things we think are good are in fact actually good. The problem here is that it is actually less coherent to assume that there is none altogether, yet somehow we perceive some than it is to say there is some, but we're just not easily able to determine its actual form, since there's a lot of similar possibilities. In the end, one of the only arguments for nihilism relies on saying that the idea of moral facts seems bizarre and we have no reason to think bizarre things like them exist. But this argument is generally seen as failing since we have a lot of reasons to think they exist. Very strong ones. No less so since there is many forms they could take, so even if some of them aren't true, others would be in their place. So people don't really need to worry that nothing matters very much. It is a fringe view in the relevant fields. (Also even the young people who claim to believe it often don't really. They just flip flop when defining their beliefs.)  If you want to know more about why this is the case, you can ask the panelists in /r/askphilosophy who have all studied it in depth to explain why nihilism is considered fringe.

I know it's hard, I suffer the whole time from being alone, I don't really have anyone to play online games with, that's why I look for people on Reddit, or something.  I guess animals are good to feel less only, there are 3 dogs, in house, where I live, but I don't feel like they are mine, never wanted them, never going to want. The other way would be if I choosed my own pet, right.  The only way I can try to help is recommending you to find something to spend time, like playing guitar, or drawing, something you will enjoy doing alone. That's how I survived to the day that's today. And if you are interested into something, try to go on meetings. So if you play guitar, go on guitar lessons, where there is not only you and teacher, but also other people. That's how you might meet new people with the same interests, instead of losing time finding people, about who you don't know anything. At least one interests in common might be always a good start.

Sure, if you find your girlfriend passed out, injuring herself, or threatening to hurt/kill herself then definitely call for help ASAP. But is it your job to prevent her from making these decisions? No. Is it your fault if she does something while you're at class or with friends? Absolutely not. Honestly, it sounds like she's getting help but needs more.

If your mother is living on her own you could move back in with her? I know most people won't enjoy it, but free room and it'll give you time to save some money and your cats could stay with you!"

There's lots of competition for any rentals, so even if I offer an insanely large pet deposit, there are ten other applicants who don't have pets, and they just choose them.  It's also a very isolated place. Funny enough, I've called on rentals that were waaaaaaay out in the country, and the owners say absolutely no pets.

This does not define you as a person.    The problem I'm facing is that as the cycles come one year after another, I am also having difficulties getting a lab job for the same reasons and it looks really bad when I come up in front of an adcom and they ask 'lightningbender, what have you done since graduation?' and I go '... er, a couple of courses and some kind of tangential non-lab volunteer work because nobody in my area does related shit and I cannot afford to pick up and live elsewhere unless there is a job'.

Age is but a number when it comes to reaching your potential. Life is hard and you need to keep kicking its ass daily until that door finally opens up, and trust me it will open up.   This is true, but a 26-year-old moocher looks kind of weird at best until then, and that's problematic for impressing people.   It took Thomas Edison over 200 failures before he ultimately invented the light bulb.   This is not what actually happened .

SuicideWatch,3cxo8t,lanabananaaas,2,Sat Jul 11 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"Question:  Have you encountered the soul-crushing, mind-numbing wringer that is the job market?  I was considerably more optimistic about my chances going into two years' worth of wanting to bang my head against a wall than I am in the thick of it.  Some of the greatest minds of our history also had people with money supporting them and walked into a very good environment or filled a niche that just happened to match their skills.  Let's be honest, it is always more complex than simple perseverance.  Success is a confluence of a number of factors.  It's not as if I haven't taken risks and sacrificed, either - I've lost a few thousand dollars to the cause already in the name of applying to sixteen schools over two years and taking a few postbaccalaureate courses.  EDIT:  I see you started your own business.  That is awesome for you, but you are probably an extrovert gifted in the art of talking a good game and convincing people to throw money at you, and such an activity overwhelms me after a short period of time because I am not an extrovert and, as I said, apparently a terrible salesperson.

SuicideWatch,3cxdt0,suicidal_girl24,9,Sat Jul 11 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"What your mother is doing is wrong. You know that, I know that, everyone here knows that. So what I'm gonna say is not, in any way, meant to excuse her, but rather provide you with some tools to deal with her.  People learn broken ways of dealing with their problems. It sounds like your mom learned to deal with them in a really toxic way. She really needs to believe that she has been a good mother. You said she feels that she's sacrificed quite a bit to be a mother, but that isn't your fault or your problem to deal with. That was her decision, and somewhere in there she knows it, too. For it to be worth it, she needs to believe that she was a good a mother. She incorrectly misinterprets your depression as a sign that she's been a terrible mother. Maybe she has been, but that's a moot point. You can't convince her of that in a way that she won't take deeply personally. You know that this is personal for her, and that gives you an advantage. In two more years, you will have the opportunity to begin cutting her out of your life, if it's necessary for your well-being. Right now, however, you live in her house and you need her to, at the very least, stop burdening you further.   The first thing you can do is find someone to support you. Your school should have counselors. Talk to one. Let them know you're drowning here. They will be there when you need to talk, and they will help you by making sure school isn't more of a burden than it needs to be. They will be able to recommend services and possibly advise you on how you can help your mother and friends understand what you're going through.  The next thing you can do is begin convincing your mother that your depression is not a result of her parenting. As unfortunate as it is that the burden falls on you, home needs to be a safe place for you. Let her know that the causes of depression aren't anyone's 'fault.' You can't help feeling this way any more than her parenting could have prevented you from reaching this point. Print out some good literature about depression (maybe a school counselor can help you with this, as well), and if she tries to ignore it, then refuse to carry on a conversation about depression until she's read it. She will do it. That is the groundwork, so to speak. From there, let her know that the things she's been saying haven't been helpful. Tell her this isn't about gratitude or the things she's given you. This is about the fact that you are hurting, and you don't know how to make that pain go away. Hearing her insult you is not helping. Tell her you want to be well, but, in no uncertain words, the way she is trying to help is not working. Your counselor, or some internet research, will have helped you find the resources you need. This could be therapy, psychiatry, or some routines you can take up. Make her understand that none of these is a sure bet, but if you could just flip a switch and be better then you would have done that a long time ago. Finding what works for you will take time, but it will be worth it.  This is getting ahead of ourselves, but If she doesn't change her behavior, if you can't salvage your relationship with her, start taking advantage of that knowledge that this is all personal for her. Placate her, use her, and just reduce the tension. Not for her sake, never for her sake. For your sake. Home, right now, needs to be a place that you can feel safe. In 2 years, if you can get independent or manage college loans on your own, you can cut her out. Maybe it'll be 6 years if you want to go to college and need your parents to help you pay for it. When you don't need her economic support anymore, cut her out. If she can't treat you with respect, you don't need her in your life.  She may care about you, but what she's showing you is not love. Can you talk to your dad about any of this? If you can, you should try. This may be a time to bond with your brother, as well. He might be going through similar things, and become someone you can count on to commiserate with. Do those things at your own discretion.   You're gonna come out of all this a stronger woman than your mother is, and many of your peers are.   Now, music helps me a lot. When I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to, certain songs offer me more than a person ever could. I'll recommend a few, let me know if you like any of them, I could probably make a whole mixtape for you, so to speak.

Instead, you're intelligent, brilliant, beautiful and have a bright future ahead of you but you can't give up now.

As a survivor of a suicide attempt, I can tell you this: No matter how much you feel like people don't care, all those people will be greatly affected by your actions. Every single person that I thought didn't give 2 shits about me was either at the hospital while the doctors were trying to save my life, showed up a bit later, and/or stood by side during my recovery. No matter how bad things get, there is always a different option than ending your life. If you can't find family or friends that will listen or understand, reach out until you find people who will. There's online support groups and hotlines you can call and from what I see, people on here who do care about you and are here to listen. Please, don't give up. Trust me, I know how bad things feel right now and the last thing you want to hear is that it gets better because that feeling seems impossible. But I wouldn't be saying it if it wasn't true. Life has its ups and downs and you're in a down right now... Keep holding on for when it goes up again. Believe that you are strong enough to push through the bs you're going through because YOU ARE.

Can't blame you for thinking along those lines, and there is a certain cold truth to basing a persons value on their utility - in certain situations.  Its just that life is much more than society and a person is more than the sum of their current social utility.   You could even stick with the strictly utilitarian model and you'd still have to face the fact that power/status is fluid and fleeting.

They can give you time and space to think, and really think about all the options ahead of you.  Do you like being outdoors?  Sitting at a computer next to a weapons closet all summer when you're not at work doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me.  In a pinch I've used sites like meetup to find groups to do things with, which is cool and the people are generally welcoming.  Have you tried anything like that?"

Obviously I don't know your boyfriend or anything about your relationship but from the little bit you have described it sounds like your boyfriend isn't listening to you.   If you've explained to him that the way he speaks to you is hurting you and he hasn't changed his behavior then I think you should try this.   Tell him again. Maybe he forgot or didn't think you were being serious. Really express how his words are making you feel. If he is a good guy then he wouldn't want his partner to be hurt because of his actions.   If he promises to be better and love and support you then you give him another chance.  If he says you are over reacting or he doesn't make good on his promises then you dump him. You don't need people dragging you down.

There are many groups you can join and people that can relate and would love to discuss it with you and show support. I don't know about your case but my mom went through this and she found many support groups for her condition on the internet(facebook and other websites) that helped her get through it.

Most (90%) get better within 12 weeks of the onset. 96% of the remaining get better within 3 years. In America, CA it took 3 years to find a doctor who even had experience with another patient. Less than 3% of the remaining will deal with the degradation that will never get better.I have had to purchase medical journals and create ( 2 ) - 5"" binders with my tests to be taken to all of my doctors. reports and tests. I have to educate my doctors on my illness. Not that they remember, because I have to constantly remind them. I have had a doctor drop me from their practice because they felt I was a drug addict wanting more drugs (seriously not AN issue as I have had a friend die from Oxycodone and seen addiction issues within my own family). Now I feel that my only recourse is to self medicate, which I am against and is in direct opposition of who I am. In the Netherlands they have a whole hospital/treatment center to support my I itial illness.  And maybe, had I insisted that's where we moved to, for me to be treated things would be different  But in America, the initial pain I feel is is ""Chron Pain Syndrome"", not "" Hey Your brain is not receiving the correct info"". So now they look at me like I am some sort of drug addict, rather than someone who has had their dominate communication venue compromised.  I used to be called lightning fingers 130 cwpm, able to seeany pathways for potential issues. Now I cannot type. I cannot life my right arm to use a mouse.

If you can't good find anything for your specific condition this seems like the best way to find support- just general chronic pain.  I honestly don't know about the doctors not helping you. You should probably post about that situation in different subreddits(i'm thinking legal issues, askDocs or something) to find the best advice for that situation. I'm pretty sure it isn't right.

Don't worry about that - it would be concerning if you weren't feeling crippled by it all.   I don't know anything about your situation or where you are from or anything but I could give you some general suggestions? I'm sure you've got a lot of it covered though.   Are you entitled to any benefits you aren't claiming? For example lower tax because of low income? I know that in Scotland the council will help with your rent if you can't pay it. Can you phone up someone from your local council to see if there is anything you are entitled to?  Can you get food from a food bank? You are exactly the kind of person they are meant to help. Contact local churches and see if they know of anything.

SuicideWatch,3cv6ud,ruderalis1,6,Sat Jul 11 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"""Be there for her!"". Shitty advice, I know, sorry. But at least try to make her feel comfortable knowing that you are there - if not consciously, then subconsciously. Let her know that she's not alone with her problems, and that you share her concerns - and ensure her of hopefully better times..  It seems you're doing great in being there for her already, and there's not much you can do in the middle of the night anyways (getting a new job, etc) - so continue being by her side. Maybe set an alarm before she usually gets up, so you can check up on her.  And even more importantly, get some ""safe ground"". I don't want to analyze a situation that I have no knowledge about, but it seems like she's very insecure about 'what's going to happen next?"", and that's a good thing to get cleared off the mind.  Talk about it, discuss possibilities in your current situation and ask friends and family for help if the problem persists.  Sorry for the shitty advice; I really don't want it to make it sound like easy solutions, 'cause they simply aren't. It'll probably take a lot of time calming down your GF, since insecurity about economics is heavily stressful.

It can feel like an insurmountable uphill battle for the both of you.  People generally think to say ""it's just a job"" but when to her it's clearly more than that...that's not going to register. There is probably more than just the loss of the job, maybe underlying issues that desperately need to be dealt with if she is feeing this way. A lot of people get depressed when losing a job but suicide is a strong impulse that can't be just forgotten about when the trouble passes.

Maybe if she gets really upset again, or to try and keep her calm when you're talking about this tomorrow, have her lay her head in your lap and slowly run your fingers through her hair and gently massage her scalp. I realize this isn't much, but hopefully it can be of use to you. You sound like a fantastic boyfriend and she's really lucky to have you in her life. Best of luck to both of you."

Even depression and death.  I believe God exists. And God says that when I am most weak his power is made most evident. So I long suffer with Christ as my example so that I can have more of Jesus.

I've never been in a relationship or even have any friends, (other than the ones I've met online,) I'm unemployed (not like I could handle work anyways,) and I have a severe lack of passion for anything.

You can also apply for disability to make sure you have an income because you have shown you can't get a job. If you need food, look up a local food pantry. There are no requirements and you can get some food to save money on other things. They also can sometimes have pain relievers and other medicines but not always.

SuicideWatch,3cv9ih,_Nothing_Matters,3,Sat Jul 11 01:41:28 2015 UTC,"First off - it does belong here! I'm quite sure this is the exact place for placing your thoughts about yourself, that you can't really put anywhere else. Friends would think you're crazy or mentally unstable, and your family would probably overreact. That's at least what I know of. I don't have any easy solutions at all. I can only tell you about what that have helped me through similar times / issues... Because I've felt quite the same about the feeling of never being able to get another girl / woman, and that life is pointless without getting a girl at the same pace as the ""norm"" tells you to, or wants you to feel like. I started exploring what I enjoyed as hobbies. I hated authoritative figures, so all the sports I tried out felt like a waste of time. I ended up picking up skateboarding, and finding a bunch of new friends that way, with whom I could share my newly found passion with. I'm definitely not advising you to pick up skateboarding, but exploring what you like as a hobby is might worthwhile on following up upon, since you'll meet new people that way, that doesn't necessarily share the same views as your current group of friends. It helped me a lot putting my mind of the stress that the ""norm"" dictates. Especially that you have to get a girlfriend here and now, or else your ""life has failed"". A very dangerous norm. If you're lucky, you'll even meet new women attending those hobbies.  A short P.S. - Sorry for the shitty advice. This helped a lot for me; broadening my 'circle of friends'. Just wanted to let you know that somebody out there cares. Surely a lot more just than I, who just doesn't know what to write. This is just me trying out."

I can tell myself, ""You're looking through a grey window. That's why things look this way.""   If there is someone you can talk to, a counselor or therapist, you don't have to disclose that you are thinking specifically about suicide with your medication.

SuicideWatch,3ctxzq,arachnophobia-kid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:28:11 2015 UTC,"You're still around after a couple days now so I'm glad for that at least. I don't think jumping off a bridge is necessary if you really think medication, therapy and the like could help you, I think you've just got to find the right doctor. Unfortunately there is a slew of shitty ones and I'm sorry you've been having to deal with them. But I think it's worth it to look for another doctor, have you already seen several different ones by any chance?  I think there are plenty of doctors who will really care for your well being and won't brush you off. I think it's worth a shot to look around til you find one of the good ones yeah?"

I'm sorry you've had to go through life dealing with that pain and loneliness. I wish so badly someone could have been there for you along the way. How is your family life through all of this? Have you been able to find some love and acceptance from them?"

SuicideWatch,3cv0dy,Phase--2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:28:59 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to understand. i helped them because I loved them and I fucked up big time with a lot of their friends older brothers/sisters.  I don't like helping people, I just did this because their my sisters and I owe them. I just wanna lay down and never be seen again."

SuicideWatch,3cuz45,middlefimber,2,Sat Jul 11 00:08:42 2015 UTC,"Depression is tough. The apathy that comes along with it is one of the worst parts, in my opinion. For me, it helps to try not to imagine the future ahead of me all at once, and just focus on taking things day by day.   Have you tried medication? Is there anyone you can talk to about the way you feel? I get that ""wanting to be alone"" feeling, but if the mood strikes you, I'd be happy to listen."
SuicideWatch,3cvhb9,lady_Reddragon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:54:41 2015 UTC,"You're scared of failing, yet you're still keeping yourself afloat. You're working, paying bills, and doing it all through a very tough situation dealing with anxiety. I know how anxiety feels, it's essentially mental torture. However, you're just starting to get therapy, so I'd say give it time. You've fought this hard to get to where you are now, so give it some more time. You can get through this."
SuicideWatch,3cvhb9,deathadder555,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:02:45 2015 UTC,It feels like it is crushing me.... I can't hold on much longer. I haven't gone through with it because i want my husband to have his utilities and rent paid for one more month.... I am not sure what to do after that...
SuicideWatch,3cvhb9,deathadder555,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"You obviously care for your husband, but ask yourself this -- does your husband want to see you happy and healthy or does he want utilities and rent for one more month? He most likely wants to see you healthy and alive. Like I said, you just started therapy and medication, try to give it some time. You can get better, you will make it through this."

SuicideWatch,3ctoyw,XBetterLife,2,Fri Jul 10 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"I have good days and bad days.  What happens during those days don't necessarily have as much to do with the ""good"" or ""bad"" I'm feeling.  Sometimes it just happens that way.  And it's not necessarily linear, either.  You could have an amazing day where you take a look at life and see a future down the road -- and then a bad one the next day when it's a struggle to get to the next minute.  It happens. It means you're not perfect. You're a human being with a range of emotions and feelings.  Sometimes I get into the mindset after a really good day that I don't deserve it, or that the next day HAS to suck because it can't get as good as what I had just experienced.  It's easier said than done, but I sometimes need to remind myself to let good things happen to me, and to feel that I'm worth the good feelings.  Sounds like you made, at the very least, a friend. And she's cute, too. And wants to grab a drink with you when she's out your way again.  I raise my glass to you -- it's a good feeling and something to look forward to. And it's okay to like that -- it's well deserved. And along with the not-so-good things, the good things will appear as well.  I hope you have a good weekend -- one where you try new things and treat yourself well.  Check in after it? Please?"
SuicideWatch,3ctoyw,JustinTherouxAway,2,Fri Jul 10 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment. Simply knowing that someone is honestly trying to help is a lot, and you said some interesting points. I was in tears while I read your comment but I usually feel better after crying, so I think that was a good thing. I hope you have a good weekend too, and don't worry about me, I'll be fine."
SuicideWatch,3ctoyw,lookingatwashington,2,Fri Jul 10 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"My guess is that for the first time in a very long time you felt genuine human connection that also allowed you to feel something deeper within yourself that has been absent in you - or always there but blocked.   Meeting this girl electrified your soul and brought it up to a level of vitality you seldom, if ever, experience due to any number of reasons that spiritual gurus, psychologists and doctors could list out for you.  And then the connection was cut. You went from being in a very high place to falling back into the general numbness of existence. The ""ho hum distract-myself-through-life"" routine.  You felt love and loved. And then it went away. So now your soul weeps."
SuicideWatch,3cv95u,Suishade6980,2,Sat Jul 11 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"Depression is a terrible place to be, I personally have found taking up  hobbies that involve socializing to help stem off these thoughts, talk to people, even private messaging a regular friend online can really help out."
