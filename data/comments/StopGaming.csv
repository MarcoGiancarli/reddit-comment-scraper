StopGaming,3e4sz7,GamingisCancer,2,Wed Jul 22 03:05:09 2015 UTC,"I guess I will share some of my story. I am almost 18 and I too have played games since I was very young...I remember playing computer games at 3/4. I spent much of my summers in front of my TV playing my PS2, and many nights under my covers secretly playing Pokemon. One Summer, before 8th grade, I played Monster Hunters Unite on my PSP everyday for who knows how long. It was God-awful and I knew it. I went to bed at 3:00 a.m. most of the time. Then there was also Graal Online Classic...I played that with my friends for over 10 hours a day...a few times I went to bed at 7:00 a.m. How fucking ridiculous is that?! I was in 7th grade.   You see, I've always been active, so I thought this was okay. It's just a hobby I do in my free-time. Well that has become the warmest pile of steaming bullshit I've told myself. It's the internet that is a problem, too. I hate it. I hate every second of checking my Facebook, or getting lost watching YouTube videos. I know I'm wasting my time. I love this forum and all, but I just want to leave the internet for a while...I don't want to be addicted...I just want to be in control and use my dopamine receptors for something good like learning or practicing my favorite instrument.  This world is huge...it really is. There's so much out there to do. I regret every penny I've spent, and that my parents have spent on video games and anything related. Games aren't inherently evil, I get that...but I just can't control myself. I think back to all of the times where I'd play AoE III and miss dinner because I was in the middle of a game online...hours and hours wasted.  Sorry for venting...I just needed to get this off my chest, and I already made a post about my story. I hope you know that you aren't alone...but also that you can do it. Delete every game that controlled your life. Get rid of anything you have that is related to those games. Your time is precious, and if you can't control your time spent gaming, then something must be done about it. I wish there was an easy way for me, but cold turkey works best. Just be sure to fill up those holes or you'll stumble.  Also, may I ask...how have you managed to deal with the internet issue? I really need some advice...even if it is plain obvious. Again, sorry for the venting haha."

I also did a lot of drugs but they were merely additives for my gaming pleasure. I'm going through a really bad breakup now and today I watched the finals on a game I used to be good at. I took the excuses that it was because of her calling me again. I can't be given myslef these little chances or permits. I struggled a lot to get where I am. Do I want go back to where I was?

I'm not gonna pretend like I know what it is, or how it works but I feel like the constant hijacking of the brains natural reward system messes with your balance somehow. Its gonna take a while before your brain re-synchronizes itself.. Took me about a year but now I'm finally enjoying hanging out with people and I don't constantly feel the need to feed my brain video games or tv to get my fix.  Of course going to the gym and the sports I play help out quite a bit in terms of endorphins and whatnot.  All I can say is if your expecting instantaneous  gratification, you're not gonna make it.

If you fancy, make a spreadsheet and label lines from 12AM to 11PM. Yes, we are making a schedule. The goal is to fill up your time without gaming.   First off, set off a nice block of 7-10 hours for sleep. Whenever you plan on going to bed to whenever you wake up. Already we've accounted for over 25% of your day at the very least. Have a job? That could take another 4-8 hours out of your day (not including commuting or getting ready for work!). Again, we're probably at 50% of your day already filled up (at a minimum) and that's just TWO things!  Don't have a job? Network, update applications, search for jobs, do some self-improving. This will at take at least a few hours each day. Work out? Probably another 1 - 2 hours. Cooking & Meal Prep? Probably another 1 - 2 hours. Reading a book? As long as you want. Finding a new hobby? Possibilities become endless.   At a very conservative estimate, you've probably filled up 15 hours of your day between sleep, working out, feeding and bathing yourself and going to work. I mean, very conservative. So much so I would tell you to get another job or sleep more just to add some filler hours. But that's besides the issue.  The point is: make a schedule, try and fill it with things you're going to do besides game. Things that have goals, that will create larger goals."

What you've already accomplished:   Stopped gaming. Congrats, this is a major accomplishment! Reading more business/news articles. This is still better than reading gaming news and is a good way to impress at work/school. Reading about fashion. Taking pride in your appearance is part of getting healthier.   So now you want to be more productive by cutting out some computer time!  Here are a few things that you must do during the normal week:   Eat Exercise Travel to work/school/hobbies Socialize   This is very simplified, but you have to do these things to live a healthy life both physically and mentally.  What I've done:   Eat - I cook at least 3-4x a week. Pick out some recipes that you've always wanted to try. If you haven't cooked before, be sure to have youtube handy to show you how to cut and follow instructions properly. If you don't have time to cook, do research on proper diet. This is another way to make online time productive and will yield real results.  Exercise - I picked up my martial arts training. Find (increase) a physical activity that you love. It won't seem like a chore if you enjoy  doing it. Travel to work - Be sure to take care of your mode of transportation. If you bike to places, this would also take care of #2. Socialize - Join a club. If you created new hobbies (like cooking, martial arts, etc), you'll naturally make some friends. If anything, hit up some coffee shops and read. This will at least get you around some people to small talk with.   Just remember that change comes slowly. A handful of smaller changes lumped together creates a very large change. It'll hit you one day when you see the results! Good luck!"

You list the sites you want to block, the timeframe you want the extension to be active for (mine is 7am - 2am), and the length of time you can access these blocked sites per day. They also recommend blocking the chrome extensions page too, so that you can't disable it once the block kicks in.  I allowed myself 90 minutes per day. The reason it's so high is that I may need to watch YouTube tutorials as part of my studies. I also watch TED talks in my free time, and I didn't want to set StayFocusd to just be active during 'work hours' because then I'd waste my evenings on mindless browsing.  Hope this helps you.

I highly recommend checking out some of the CGAA meetings online.  You'll meet a lot of people who are/have been in the same boat and are making good progress in turning their lives around.  I recommend taking it just one day at a time, keeping it a top priority to not start that first game, and maintaining as much contact as you can with other people on similar paths."

StopGaming,3dy35w,Error40404,10,Mon Jul 20 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"I think you seem to understand this all wrong. There is no ""You should quit"".  Quit gaming is a decision and not a must. The people you will meet here have recognized gaming as something that strongly influences and restricts their life mostly in a negativ way. And on top of that, they don't know how to stop.  Almost everyone here wants to live a better life than now.   I can tell from my own experience, that when I was 16 (I am 19 now) I was in the same situation as you. I enjoyed gaming like nothing else. I was always at home playing from after school to evening. I didn't have any real life friends that played on my level, so I basically spent most of the time with people I only knew from online.  I also went to a psychotherapist and asked her ""What if this is how I want to live my life to be happy?""  Well, if I had the chance to meet my past, I would warn myself about the upcoming problems. Silly ""me"" thought he could keep on living this life forever in that way. Just game and do nothing else. To be honest, it worked perfectly fine for 6-7 years before I eventually broke down. I completely failed in school, I was a social disaster with no friends, I was eating unhealthy and had overweight.   When I found this subreddit and heard about all the other people, I felt not alone with my problems for the first time in my life. I immediately uninstalled League of Legends and thought myself ""Time will pass anyway, so why not also make the best out of it?""  Edit: If you want to know more, you can message me and we can talk a bit about this topic. Remember: Time is limited and it's your choice what you make out of it."
StopGaming,3dy35w,Scriptopeia,2,Mon Jul 20 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"You are actually doing better than me. I play like crazy I can't even have the decision to run for 30min. I'm playing not because of my friends I'm playing for my self whether my friends are online or not. It sounds like when your friends would stop playing I'm guessing you would stop too. So it sounds to me that you are just being a typical teenager instead of skateboarding outside you are doing it differently. If that is true then I guess you are not ""addicted"". I guess you'll realise you're addicted when you keep on playing even without your friends and would always put gaming your priority that I would consider an addiction. Btw, I'm speaking for myself and not representing the group."
StopGaming,3dy35w,theredditor415,4,Mon Jul 20 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the group, but as long as you don't see it interfering with other parts of your life, maybe it's ok.  It's been said that time spent doing exactly what you want is never wasted time.  But you need to consider the opportunity cost of the time you spend gaming.  That is to say, could you (or should you) be doing something more constructive with your time?  You are young.  I am older.  At 47, I was about 9 or 10 when I got an Atari 2600 for Christmas.  I've played so many hours of video games.  I've had so many game systems and computer games that it's really crazy to think not of the hours I've spent, but literally the YEARS of my life that I've gamed.  When I say years, I  mean 24 hours x 365 days = 8,760 hours. Just take one game - Call of Duty WAW.  Looking at my stats there, I can see that I have like 45 days playing that game alone.  And that's just 1 game on 1 system!  When you consider the systems I've played:    Atari Pong  Atari 2600  Atari 400  Atari 800  Playstation I  Sega Genesis  Jaguar  Xbox  Xbox 360  Xbox 1 And about every gen. of computer going back to the 286   So, the list just goes on and on and on.  This doesn't even include the hours and hours spend in video arcades.  And also the countless hours spent playing board games.  If you think you are ok, you probably are.  But just be careful, and realize that you are making a choice here and that time spent gaming, if not wasted time, is absolutely time that you could be doing something else, something lasting, time that you could be using to something great with your life.    No one knows how much  time they will have, but it's finite and every minute gone, is gone.  Edit:  Grammer"

StopGaming,3dxod6,camerondare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:52:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much my entire life story could be told by describing three things.  1) Things that have happened that have hurt me, 2) the ways I tried to deal with that pain, and 3) the way the things in #2 have harmed me (and often caused yet more pain).  Gaming was a way for me to deal with the pain, and yet it has caused an enormous amount of suffering in my life simply because it became an addiction for me.  It took a long time for me to figure all of this out, but I can actually see the early warning signs of gaming addiction in my life from around the age of six.  Things didn't get to a point where they were really messing me up until about two decades later, but gaming addiction has helped foster a lot of self-hatred and suicidal thinking in my life, brought me to a place of total despair and hopelessness, and also caused some significant mental problems as I started going through withdrawal when I got serious about quitting.  All this to say, I know what it's like to game because of the fact that something in life hurts.  The things in my life that hurt aren't the things that you're having a hard time with, but I'm not totally clueless.  You don't have to be alone, and if you're anything like me, your thinking on the subject is going to be an awful lot worse than the reality.  If everything I ever thought about myself and my situation were true, I wouldn't be here, because I'd have killed myself some time ago (hopelessness is essentially impossible to live with).  Thankfully, my view of the world and my circumstances was mistaken, I just couldn't see it until I started making changes in how I was living.  Some of the changes people suggested I make didn't make any sense, and some of them I actively fought making, but some of those very ideas have been some of the most powerful when it comes to transforming my life and how I experience it."

There is so much more to do, but not having a ""go-to"" that is video games, is the first step.  You need to be okay with being bored, find something else to invest your time in, like dreams and having a purpose in life."
StopGaming,3dxiex,kaladyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"One way to test whether or not your addicted is to try and go for an extended time without playing any game at all.  Simply decide that you aren't going to play any video games of any sort for ____ days (I suggest 30 as a rock-bottom minimum), and then just pay attention to how you handle those 30 days.  If you honestly try, but literally can't make it for time you set for yourself, odds are awfully good you've got an addiction.  If you do make it, notice how your thinking and feeling change over that time period.  If by the end of that time, you're feeling pretty peaceful and didn't find it particularly difficult after the first week or two, there's a decent chance you're not addicted.  I say ""decent chance"", because addiction is a progressive disease, and it may be that you're addicted, but simply haven't gotten to the point where that length of time is impossible for you to do alone.  If you can make it, but have been dealing with lots of anxiety and/or agitation over not playing, odds are pretty good that you're an addict.  Nobody can decide whether or not you're an addict except for you, and although there are signs that point one way or another, they are sometimes misleading.  Hope all goes well for you."

Sure, I suppose they can both be addictive in some ways, but it's like the difference between crack cocaine and marijuana.   The depths that gaming addiction can drag you to are scary. Failing out of school, losing a job, breaking up a family, financial ruin... we've all experienced or heard about gaming addicts who had these terrible consequences. I haven't heard of anyone experiencing these same problems because they are on Reddit too much.  Of course we would all like to spend all of our time on really valuable activities that make our lives worthwhile and fulfilling and happy. But the people I know who have been the most successful at 1) overcoming their addiction for the long haul, and 2) building a life that is full and rich and happy, are the ones who were able to accept that they had a lot of things to work on but just picked the one most important thing at any given time.  If you're quitting gaming, then any day that you don't play a game is a success no matter what else happens. As soon as you start beating yourself up over all the other stuff you want to change, you're going to forget why you quit gaming in the first place and be right back where you started."

Because I'm sure it wasn't so that he could spend his whole weekend browsing reddit. I'm guessing that maybe his goal wasn't simply to quit gaming.

StopGaming,3dtigx,StoicRazor,4,Sun Jul 19 10:37:11 2015 UTC,"The podcast was The Tim Ferriss Show, episode from June 9th entitled ""Thomas Edison's Formula for Greatness"".  Do you mean which app do I use to listen to podcasts? Just the default Apple podcast app on my iPhone (or iTunes if I listen on my laptop, which is very rarely).  As for the last question, I guess it depends on which 90 days I look at--when I quit drinking, or when I quit gaming. As you can guess from my badge, I didn't quit gaming until I was about 9 months sober. For me, alcohol was the bigger problem that had to be addressed first.  In any case, in the beginning the most important thing for me was to avoid being alone. The crazy, obsessive voice in my head that tries to convince me to do shit that I don't really want to do gets stronger and stronger the longer I am alone. To silence that voice, I sought the company of others who shared my problem and were willing to help. For an alcoholic, that means going to A.A. meetings. For a gaming addict, there are a few options but nothing as ubiquitous and accessible as Alcoholics Anonymous.  Maybe one other tidbit that may or may not be helpful is that the first 90 days are just the beginning. Lots of people told me this, but I don't know if it really sunk in until later. Here's a brief journal entry from last year when I was about 2 1/2 months sober:   I don't want to fucking work on shit that requires brain power right now. I'm not supposed to be playing video games, but I don't know what else to do that won't make me feel like life is an unfulfilling dirge march. Fuck.   I don't write journal entries like that anymore, but I remember the feeling. It sucks to be in that twilight zone where you removed the one thing that made you feel good at least temporarily (gaming/alcohol/whatever) and now you just have to face the reality of your life, warts and all. It probably takes the entire first 90 days just to get used to that and become ready and willing to move on to what's next."

I failed out of college twice due to my addictions.  The turning point was when my parents cut off my support, at the strong urging of their therapist. I couldn't live in their house, I couldn't use their car, and I certainly wasn't getting any more money. They were still loving and supportive, but any material support was out of the question.  I didn't get completely sober or quit gaming for almost 9 more years, but my life did actually get better from that point. It was the start of my recovery.

Unfortunately there isn't much you can do other than try and maintain a positive relationship with him so when he's ready to have the conversation he knows he can come to you guys.  I just finished reading In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Maté, and although the book deals with addiction in general, the second last chapter is about the role of a parent and how to intervene/what you can do. I'd highly recommend finding the book and reading that chapter specifically to better understand this process.  I also have a few articles I've written directly to parents of gamers that may help you."
StopGaming,3ds9c0,camerondare,6,Sat Jul 18 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"Dr. Gabor Mate is one of the best in the field of addiction. Great book. Here is a short clip from Dr. Gabor Mate in an interview about addiction.   I agree with Camerondare, check out that book. I've been in your sons shoes before, just involving something else, though the same habits of becoming reclusive and withdrawn from family & friends, irritable, anti-social, were all there. I will say that, being there for him, staying positive, and making sure he can come to you is most important for him and for you as a family. One thing that made things worse for me during my problem, and for others, is a parent/friend/anyone thinking they know the reason for it, and it's as simple as  telling me ""you're addicted, just stop doing this/acting this way"", thinking that would make me stop. This is a good way at making sure someone will shut you out, and put up a wall, even reinforce the behavior in some instances. Plus, there might be an underlying issue behind all of this, depression, social anxiety. I'm not saying thats the case here, but keep an open mind.   I think it's great that you guys are looking for some input/help from people, as to how to approach this situation. So many parents don't do this. I hope others can give some more info that may better suit the situation."

What I would recommend for parents (other than reading the chapter I mentioned) is to try and identify more about why their son is playing games. It's easy to get caught up in games being the problem when in reality games are just the activity/outlet that is fulfilling certain needs their son has.  It's not always easy to identify the underlying issues but it's something to think about. Maintaining a positive relationship is always priority #1 because otherwise, as the OP posted, trying to talk to them can fall on deaf ears.  Edit: I would also encourage OP to read this thread, from another parent."
StopGaming,3ds9c0,camerondare,4,Sun Jul 19 00:20:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly. Be tough. I find the whole ""talk to your kids and have them understand"" is bullshit. I knew all the right things to say to get myself in the good books while not changing. I wasn't alone in this.  I am not saying, don't talk to your kids. DO talk to your son, but do it differently. One thing  my grandmother did was one day asked me if I was at all interested in dating. (I was in my early mid 20s and hadn't started dating yet). Then she asked why. etc. Those type of conversations got me talking. I tried this tactic with friends and it works. So pretty much, try to pin point the issues and start the discussion. There may be some guessing games at first.   Cutting support is differently a great idea. It's hard, but will give your son a wake-up call. When I turned 20, my grandmother (who raised me) started charging me rent. Mind you, it's only $100 bucks (I am 27 now and the rent is the same) but it taught me some viable lessons. I also contribute to food ever two weeks. She stopped paying for personal care, pet costs, cellphone, entertainment, and such.   I would also recommend that you charge your son 50% of the internet bill."

I think they could assist in pushing him in the right direction.  Pair yourself with reinforcing things; while he may be addicted to video games and there may not be many things he derives pleasure from; generally I as an addict still really liked going to places like six flags, movies, barbecues, awesome restaurants, etc. You probably know some stuff he likes. We ABA therapists would take the ""ease into the water approach"" with our clients. Our first sessions with new clients would often just be doing something fun with the client and we'd slowly put in demands. I think that'd be a good idea to apply.  You could also potentially try to take some interest in the game while he's playing; be cautious with that he might hate you intruding on his private space etc.  After you've felt you've ""paired yourself with reinforcers"" a few times without any demands ease into a conversation with him about addiction; I'd say keep it brief and gauge his mood prior to. This has to be what we'd refer to as a ""teaching moment"": he has to be receptive if he's in a crappy mood he's less likely to tolerate even listening. If he's looking for a gaming fix or if attending to you means he has to pause the game that's not a very good ""teaching moment"". You wanna approach the topic when he's in a good mood and when he's idle.  You want your conversation to be a positive experience so keep it very brief (maybe 30secs to a minute; so don't go into the conversation all willy nilly plan what you're going to say). We'd treat client ""tolerance and waiting"" as a skill.   Another way to make it a positive experience is to reinforce his tolerance of the conversation. If he doesn't flip out at you reinforce it. For instance: reinforce that behavior by saying something such as, ""thanks for listening; want a beer etc.""  Also your presence may be an aversive stimulus so right after you approach the topic it may be a good idea to give him some peace.  I've got some more ideas if you want; but I'll leave it at that for now. Good Luck"

When I was addicted to video games, I ended up figuring out for myself that I wanted more out of life, so eventually I quit by myself, but it was pretty obvious to my family members that I was addicted at the time.  Some people have suggested kicking him out of the house. I think that this might help jump start his life a bit, but would he be able to financially attend college if he had to live elsewhere? If he's almost graduated, you might want to wait until he is before kicking him out. Charging him rent so that he has to pick up a part time job might be the lesser of two evils."

Tell him that you think that he is addicted and unsocial and that you would agree on paying for counseling. Then go on and also tell him that it is his life and that he will have to fix his own addictions and depression himself if he doesn't listen to others. Then tell him that you will let him do as he pleases in the future without bickering any more or even bringing up his addictions again (that's what I would call a 'bait' in order for him not to get angry over you). Ultimately, make it very clear that you will not pay for failure if he messes up exams and has to redo a year. You'd basically kick him out of the house if he doesn't work for the exams.

StopGaming,3dr7cf,wald3333,2,Sat Jul 18 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Let's see if I can help give you some pointers. It's taken me 6 years to finish college, but I've completed over 40% of my coursework in the last year alone. In fact, I'm on my last class now, as a summer class and will graduated in early August.  First, don't think of being too early as ever being a bad thing. I used to crave efficiency, getting irritated at being to early (a trait common in gamers). But now, I embrace being early, and use the time to meditate, listen to music, etc.  Second, unlike other habits, scheduling in my opinion does not reward you with good feelings, but rather an absence of bad feelings, making it harder for people like us. Scheduling will be key, and will take work, and perseverance, and flexibility to make it work.  Start by organizing your ""to-do's"" into 3 categories: A, B, and C. You can start at either end, but I like to use C for Critical (most important) tasks. These are what you plan your day around. Gotta mow the lawn and there will probably only be one day to do it? It's a critical task. Have a test in the next week? Critical. Got homework due tomorrow? Critical. Get these done ASAP.  Then there's your B tasks. Need to study in general for a test? B. Get it done after there are no more C tasks today. (By the way, if a C task looks like it will take more time than one day's worth of work, break it into equal pieces, each one a chunk that could be accomplished in one chunk, like 4-6 hours, of work) Need to make a schedule/add to it? B task if not the first time.  Then there's the A tasks. Things that won't likely get done unless you foresee a lot of free time. Gaming must go into this. And be honest with this category, and with gaming. If you have anything to do, gaming must be put off. There will always be games, and people playing them. Come back later.  Using this technique, I built my schedules, and realized very quickly that, if I was honest with myself, I had little, if any, time for A activities, for gaming.  And it worked. It sucked, because tasks seemed to take so long. 3 hours, which seemed like nothing when gaming, dragged on forever when working on papers or studying for an exam when I had the urge to game made it so hard to focus. And I had to keep adding time because my productivity plummeted. But over time, as I stuck to it, the results showed, and here I am now about to graduate with a 3.5 GPA, a job, etc.  And as for the getting started, you have to think critically about the task at hand. Break it down into chunks. Try to predict the time it will take do the chunks. For example: Writing a paper. I hate doing papers. So, I would sit down, estimate 30 minutes for researching the topic, and would time myself. I would then start writing as much as I could for 30 minutes and then hop back over to research, if there was still more to do. I guess what I am saying is trying anything and everything is better than getting nothing done at all.  Sorry for the wall of text. Hope some of this helps."

StopGaming,3dr7cf,TheLoneGreyWolf,2,Sat Jul 18 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"""Trying harder"" never worked for me, so I wouldn't recommend that route. I'll also say that what you're struggling with is difficult for almost everybody, especially gaming addicts, so don't be too hard on yourself if you're not perfect. Changing this type of behavior can take a really long time, but it's certainly possible.  In any case, making and keeping a schedule is kind of a high-level desire. You could dig a little deeper and maybe that would provide some more insight into what type of specific habits/behaviors you're actually trying to work on.  Try doing the five whys: Ask yourself why you want to make and keep a schedule, and then ask yourself why to that answer, and then why again, and so on. Example:   Why do I want to make and keep a schedule? So I can get stuff done on time. Why do I want to get stuff done on time? So I won't have to rush to do everything at the last minute. Why don't I want to rush and do everything at the last minute? Because it's really stressful and I feel like my life is out of control.   And so on. Once you uncover the real emotions behind what you're trying to do, it makes it a little more tangible. When you have trouble starting work on some important task, instead of telling yourself ""I need to stick to my schedule!"" you can instead remind yourself of the deeper pain you feel from being out of control."

I haven't written a lot about this yet, but a big piece of the book I'm writing on this gaming issue is about how (part) of the reason gaming can become a problem is due to this masculinity crisis in boys and how when you quit, you're actually going on a journey from being a boy to becoming a man.  I know that was the case for me. As difficult as quitting gaming was over the past many years, it's been a process of me learning more about myself and truly stepping into my role as a man, things I don't really feel like I was taught growing up - like you.  Just know you aren't alone and we've got your back. :)"
StopGaming,3dokj1,Qsquat,2,Fri Jul 17 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"Hey! Yes, many of us have gone cold turkey. I went cold turkey and was successful for 11 months before I relapsed, which ended up causing me to game 16 hours a day for 5 months straight. Then I recommitted to quitting and haven't touched one since!  I find cold turkey works best because it's a recognition that this is about much more than games. This is about getting your life back on track and by continuing to game you're really just ""one foot in, one foot out"" and procrastinating what I imagine in your heart you know you want to do.  Now the reason for this is because you're scared, and that's normal and ok. Gaming has been a big part of your life and it has fulfilled certain needs you have. It's a core piece of your identity, so thinking about life without games is intense! We've all been there.  There are solutions though and I'd recommend reading this post. It will help you understand more about what's going on and the different steps you can take to be successful.  You can also watch this video about going cold turkey.  Ok so lastly, before deciding whether to continue playing ps4 or runescape, what I would suggest is to go 90 days cold turkey. This is what research shows you need for your brain to rewire back to normal dopamine sensitivity levels. In doing the 90 day detox you give yourself an opportunity to learn about what life is like without games, you get to learn more about yourself and the role gaming plays in your life, and you get to come back to this question with more clarity. Plus, if you can't go 90 days without playing games you probably shouldn't be playing games in the first place. If you want to learn more about the structural changes that can happen to your brain from excessive gaming, watch this video.  Hope that helps. We've got your back. :)"

I've quit playing all games just recently, but I have gone cold turkey and had streaks in the past that were rather remarkable for me at least...I think 4 months isn't bad. Now I'm not saying games are terrible, but the problem is that I am just too addicted to them. I can tell you that I have played waaaay too much games since I was just 4/5 years old! I kid you not. I recall spending an entire Summer in my room playing Monster Hunters Unite on my PSP (in eigth grade I think) That was sad...seriously...it got so hot in my room and I would just waste my time playing it. From waking to 2:00 a.m. Then I would wake up at 3 or 4 in the afternoon.   This is one example of my problem. After that, I tried to stop many times. I was successful my Junior and Senior year of high school, but I recently started playing a new game I found for waaaay too long. This time I'm going to be more serious.  The only games I play are with my friends and at their houses (Smash Bros., Basketball etc.). Otherwise I try to do things with my friends that get me away from games...just driving around town or going on a bike ride...and especially checking out restaurants! The most important thing in my opinion is to recognize what worth games have in your life and make sure that you don't go overboard. For me, I have little self control since I've played them for so long, so It's best if I quit in my personal life."

I was already gaming a lot less in the year or so leading up to when I quit for good, mostly because I was just crazy busy with the rest of my life. I was in grad school and then had a new baby, so the time I had for gaming was very scarce.  I eventually reached a point, after a weekend binge during a rare stretch of free time, when I just knew that gaming had no place in my life anymore. Now it's like... smoking cigarettes. I understand why other people smoke, how it feels good and relaxes you, but I would never smoke. I just don't even consider it as a possible action I could take, ever. That's what games are to me now. Sure, maybe they have benefits to some people, but I know the effect they had on my life and I'm done."

I tried quitting League of Legends and moving back to Runescape because it's more low-geared, but although the urge to play and obsession were weaker and I wasn't thinking about the game all the time as with LoL, it still ended up being as effective in wasting my time.   Since then I went back to LoL, and I quit 15 days ago cold turkey, and it's really not that difficult to be honest, so far at least, specially if you have/find something that keeps you busy or takes its place.

That being said, I tried really hard to moderate for quite a while, and it didn't work.  Either I didn't play any game at all, or I played more than I'd planned on...often a LOT more than I'd planned on.  I didn't show up to work when I'd wanted to.  I didn't get homework done when I'd wanted to.  I didn't get to bed anywhere NEAR the time I'd planned on (and the lack of sleep caused issues of its own).  When I went to quit, I found out a few things right away.  First, I found out about my other addiction.  Second, I found out about how I experience withdrawal symptoms from gaming (apathy being the big one for me).  Third, I used games to deal with all kinds of things that I didn't even realize were there.  I once heard it put like this.  ""When a heavy gamer stops, the problem stops.  When a gaming addict stops, the problem starts.""  That's what happened for me.  I stopped gaming, and promptly discovered that games weren't my problem, they were my solution to my problems, and I had not idea what to do when my solution was taken away from me.  It hasn't been easy, but thankfully, I didn't have to do it alone.  I also don't have to ""white-knuckle"" it the whole time, a fact for which I'm profoundly grateful.  I tried the white-knuckle approach for a while, and it just didn't work for me.  If that was the only way to do it, I'd probably have given up some time ago, and I don't even want to think about where my life would be had that happened.  My brain on games is hardly work calling a brain anymore, it gets messed up so badly.  Since I like being able to think about real world issues, and for me gaming and thinking are (apparently) mutually exclusive activities, I choose not to game, even though I really did enjoy quite a few things about my gaming.  Best of wishes on this journey.  Just remember...giving up is a method that nobody has ever made work yet.  Setbacks sometimes happen, but if you give up, that's the end of the road."

The first symptom to show up was the somnolence, this one was easy, besides I had so much sleeping to catch up on, it was actually beneficial. It's outstanding how much more alive your face looks when you're well rested. Moving on.  I had prepared a few books and activities before starting this whole thing as to keep my mind occupied, I didn't want reddit/youtube/etc to replace my old habits that sounds very counterproductive. It worked for a while, but my mind quickly started breaking apart, nothing I could think of felt interesting, even those things that I really want to do, I wish I could find a word for this kind of extreme demotivation, my subconscious wants me to go back to games so badly that it's making everything else seem unappealing.   This is the part where I've never felt so disconnected, my body and brain are actively working against me, there's no harmony, I feel like there's 2 different people with 2 completely different goals living inside of me (figuratively speaking). This crisis is feeding depression, something that if i had not become aware of, would probably push me towards failure and relapse really quickly, depression clouds your judgement and tries to convince you that your goal is not worth all this stress.  I'm gonna try meditation, my head needs a little bit more time to adapt and feel comfortable without instant gratification. I know that if I go back right now it would feel so darn satisfying that I'd end up playing for hours on end like never before.  Proof-reading this I noticed how much I sound like an addict, wow.

StopGaming,3dmklw,LearningSerenity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:58:48 2015 UTC,"One of my more noticeable withdrawal symptoms was apathy.  It didn't last for more than a week or two, but I had to go through it every time I relapsed, and it was rather unpleasant to say the least.  I found it pretty much impossible to want to do anything other than game (or use my other addiction), and had to make choices to do good and healthy things for myself even though I didn't feel like it and didn't usually enjoy doing them.  The apathy is probably due to the neurochemical changes going on right now due to your stopping the games, and will probably fade over the next while if you keep staying off of them.  My other major symptom was total brain meltdown, in which I found it nearly impossible to handle complex thought.  That was even less fun than the apathy for me, and not just because of how much longer it lasted.  I know some people who are addicted to games in addition to things like drugs and/or alcohol, and they all had the same thing to say...gaming addiction is every bit as real and damaging as their substance addictions.  It certainly messed with my head... :/"

In fact, most people are able to control their gaming and do not even think about it. Gaming, to most, is a fairly mundane topic and form of entertainment. Certainly enjoyable, but not the struggle that we feel when we are trying to play.   It is important to ask yourself why it is so important to moderate your gaming?

I recommend you just step away from the games and don't even worry about any of your other vices right away. Just get to a point where you're comfortable without gaming, and then you can think about cutting down on the web browsing, etc.  I let reddit/youtube/etc. take the place of gaming for me while I got used to living without it.

Having said that, especially since you're only a week in from the sounds of it, it's not a huge deal. Yeah, ideally you don't want to waste all your time if you can help it but take it slow.   I knew quitting games would be difficult so I told myself whatever I needed to do (with in reason) to not touch a single game than I'll do it. Whether that's binge watch TV shows or movies or fap or go out, I did it. Now going super crazy and unproductive only lasted about 2 or 3 weeks then I was able to transfer to being more productive but still if I was ever feeling demotivated and knew if I didn't just chill out and watch some TV then the alternative would be me playing games which I didn't want.   No one starts juggling 10 balls at once no matter how cool or awesome that sounds. Bruce Lee said something like, ""Long term consistency always beats short term intensity"".   Having said that, if you haven't already, you might want to start looking for things and activities you're interested in and can potentially become passionate about; whether it's creative writing to eventually write a novel, learning to draw/paint, skateboarding, jiu jitsu, cooking, working on cars, hiking, programming etc. This way you'll have something fun and productive to do during your free time .

StopGaming,3dkzea,noobcrusher,3,Fri Jul 17 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"Exercising pure willpower from gaming is frankly not a great way to just stop gaming. It's like asking someone who's obese to suddenly stop their bad dieting habits out of nowhere or someone who's addicted to pot to go cold turkey without any real reason except ""it's bad for you"".  For every dependence on anything whether it's a substance or it's virtual, there will be a wide variety of reasons why you would drawn to it.  For me, gaming was an escape from all of my problems without having to deal with it in a constructive manner. You need to fully understand why you participate in such destructive gaming habits before you can heal and you also need to know what do you seek to gain from quitting games. Replacing gaming with another bad habit such as marathon anime watching is essentially the same thing.  When I quit for the last time and took on my problems head on, the overwhelming need to game had magically disappeared. Sometimes I do feel pangs here and there but I remind myself that it is getting in the way of the goals I truly want to achieve (not goals that someone sets for you like ""learn programming"") and because I no longer want to run away from the world."
StopGaming,3dkzea,woodtierplayer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:40:30 2015 UTC,Fair points. Do you think you could ever safely return to gaming now that you understand why you were drawn to it? Or is that understanding in and of itself reason to stay away from it? I think most of us agree that the game itself is not inherently evil but we abuse the entertainment and do less productive things with our time.

I want to get into med school and frankly, there would be no time to even play LoL or whatever once I get in. Full time work, studying for med entry test, gym, LoL and friends is too much. Something has to go.  And yes, I would suggest not touching it at all. I have deleted my LoL accounts (set with 10minutemail emails and random password). Despite understanding the reasons for my addiction, I don't exactly trust myself 100%. I feel that if you continue to play, you are always treading on the line between playing healthily and relapsing into a virtual coma so to speak. Understanding the reasons behind my addictions helps me deal with it in a more constructive way where I can rationally deal with it rather than exercising pure willpower without any real foundation.  Like I said, it really depends what you want from life. If doing absolutely nothing productive actually made me very happy, then whose place is to say I can't do that (as long as I'm not leeching from parents who work hard or whatever)? But if you truly want to shine in something challenging whether it's professional sports, career, musician, blogging, Youtube video creator etc. you must quit or at the very least, limit your gaming.

Smashing your toes with a hammer requires more willpower than either moderation or abstinence from gaming, yet it offers no benefits.  I think that focusing on willpower by itself is a pointless activity. It is much more important to focus on the potential benefit/harm of the action or behavior. To answer your question, I consider gaming to be of very little value to majority of people, therefore forgoing gaming entirely (abstinence) is more beneficial than moderating usage because it frees up more time and resources to pursue more valuable activities."

StopGaming,3dkfnb,fishbaste,2,Fri Jul 17 09:36:06 2015 UTC,"I've been through similar things, related to guilt. Since I was maybe 8-9 years old, my parents were talking about stuff like ""how will you ever get a job and succeed in life if you're just playing all day long? You'll become a cripple from all that time sitting down!""  Terrible things to say, but I guess it was from desperation when they just didn't how to make me spend less time at the computer. Instead, it only led me to keep playing to escape my feelings of guilt, while feeling worthless in the process. I don't suffer from the same self-confidence issues any more, but I still have difficulties facing certains kinds of failure. I think that's also why I've mostly played single-player games; that way I wouldn't have to feel inferior to other players.  Sorry for the big downer post. However, I think quitting games and talking about these issues helps me understand this part of me. In time, it could probably help me find ways of overcoming these issues as well. Either way, your post helped me realize this about myself as well. Thank you."
StopGaming,3di9u0,lNitesH,8,Thu Jul 16 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"How can I ditch gaming forever without regretting it later?   Here's another fallacy that needs a good name.  The In-The-Future-I'll-Probably-Regret-Not-Gaming-More fallacy.  Ask around and you'll hear that life is full of regrets, but you won't hear one single person lamenting, ""Oh, if only I had gamed more!""  You'll hear plenty of ""if only I had been more involved in life"" or ""more involved with my family and friends"" or ""more active in pursuing my dreams"", but there will never be a person who looks back on life and says, ""Oh woe is me!

StopGaming,3di9u0,Scott3611,3,Thu Jul 16 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"I think that it's better to just stop altogether. I've tried this method of moderating it, setting a limit of 2 hours or less, but we all know that gaming requires more time than this. No one ever quit gaming and regretted later. It seems that you are associating all these things together, the gaming, the porn, and the unhealthy foods. Now, I don't think that gaming itself is what leads you to do these things, but you have developed this association over time.   In my opinion, fapping is different. Masturbation is healthy, and it's part of human nature. Try doing it without the porn. I'm not sure if youre single, or in a relationship. Either way, I understand that we get horny and it's an easy way to relieve stress. It's what we know best right now.   We get stuck in this cycle. Gaming is what we know best because its so easy, and we are good at it. Our minds don't think of a way to challenge the life we live currently.   For now, I don't think you should try to moderate gaming. You have to completely stop playing. Moderation for me was not possible, and it seems that it is not for you as well. You say you've wasted a lot of money on gaming, and I can relate to you on that. I bought a 1000$ computer with desk and chair (1200$). I also have scoliosis and a huge shoulder problem that is ruining my life. Most of it occurred because of my gaming! Scoliosis at 23! Also, you say you've wasted a lot of money, but you want to keep buying more games. It will never end! FIFA is the same shit every year.   So these reasons, and the fact that gaming was making me an angry person and I no longer saw fun in my gaming time, was enough for me to quit. Do I want to play? Yes, sometimes I do, but I know that sitting for long would only hurt me.   Always think of reasons why you don't want to play. For me, I just think of myself playing CS, getting a high of it, and getting angry as well. As a third person in my head, I know that in the end, I will not have fun. Same with FIFA as well. I used to play a lot of FIFA, but I know that all the bullshit will make me angry, so I just don't play. Relate this to your unhealthy eating habits as well. If I eat this donut, I know that I will feel good for a minute or two, but after that, I will feel like shit. Also, healthy food can taste great. You just have to put the effort in finding good recipes out there and cooking it.   For the porn, I don't have any advice. I'm in a relationship, and I know that my girlfriend doesn't like when I watch it. She had been gone for a month and is returning soon, and I found it difficult to just use my thoughts. I did well for the first two weeks, then started looking at pictures, then porn again. So yes, it is difficult. One thing that helped was knowing that porn demeans women.  I am happy that you are trying to change your life. I am in the same situation as you. I'm not sure if you have a job or anything yet, but I understand what its like to want to change and being stuck. I mope around all day at home, trying to find things to do.  So just try to think of things to do, and try to stay away from the computer chair, or couch. Start working out. It will promote better eating habits. Combine this with Intermittent Fasting. I found it easier to eat, even if it was something unhealthy. Say to yourself, I don't watch porn, I don't play videogames (I got this from another post here). Repeat these words."

I'd like to say that I'll try to quit gaming, once again, cold turkey because as you said, Fifa is the same every year and I'm pretty much wasting my time. Actually I'd prefer to use those 60$ of fifa on clothes or gym equipment/membership. Also, on the topic of unhealthy eating, I'm much better at controlling that but I'd love to be more in control by learning how to cook but no-one in my family shows me how to do it, my mom just ignores me minutes after I tell her I want to learn. Also on the topic of porn, when I start gaming, I tend to stay more at home and tend to be more lonely thus leading to fapping 2-3 times a day. I have to stop doing all of this. I believe the root of evil in my life is gaming. It's time to change but I don't know what to REALLY do. I started reading, after my relapse, I read even less (haven't read at all today). I started going out a lot just shopping or relaxing outside in the sunshine but after my relapse I prefer staying at home for some odd reason. I have problem finding things to do, specially in summer but I believe it will change because I'm starting my first year of college in september. Hopefully I'll train myself to be more social and productive this summer and leave my old habits behind ready for college."
StopGaming,3di9u0,reivolver,2,Thu Jul 16 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"I definately get what you're saying with being at home and not being shown. Perhaps your mom doesn't want to show you because she wants to take care of you in her own weird way. But that's an entirely different thing. I'm not a great cook myself, but there are easy recipes out there, and they can be found on YouTube. If you're moving out, then this will become easier. You have full control and can't blame anyone but yourself if you wish to eat healthy and you're not.   If you truly believe that gaming is causing these problems, then the only solution is to stop, as you've said. Again, like me, you associate gaming will all these problems that are arising. But gaming is a non-living thing, and it can't force us to do these things by itself. Hell, even living things like your mom or my friends can't get us to do things that we don't like.   What are you reading? Is it dry? Or fictional and exciting? Try playing the book. Imagine yourself the character and treat the story as a game. Start to journal. It's good to just write down your thoughts in the morning and keep it on a journal pad. It doesn't have to be everyday. Somedays you won't have thoughts, or they'll be the same thoughts from yesterday.   Don't place hope that college will be your saviour. It's good that you want to make these changes for college though! However, college won't change your behaviors. Ah, if you are swamped in homework and you focus on these tasks and assignments that you have to do, then your life will be busy, and soon gaming and porn will be irrelevant and non-existent in your mind. But, it could also go the other way around. So gaming and porn will take over college. This, we have to be careful of. Especially during the winter, when we have to stay inside because its too cold. But again, remember that it's our habits, so winter or summer, we still choose to stay inside, as I am doing right now instead of being out in this warm weather :) It's difficult!  Take your book and go outside and read for a couple of hours. Bring some water and some healthy snacks. DONT buy anything from stores like ""healthy chips"" or whatever the fuck they sell now.  I like to make protein shakes, so some New Zealand Whey protein, strawberries, a banana, and some spinach. Add cinnamon and blend that shit up. Tastes amazing and it gives you that feeling of being accomplished because its so healthy (watch the sugars from the fruits though). And these could be switched with anything.   Way to go on the progress you've made my friend. Every little thing counts. Congratulate yourself. You're trying hard. Just saying that you would prefer to spend the 60$ on a gym membership (or clothes :P) is amazing enough. Buy books, or even a kindle.   You can do this!"

For example: Just finished a relationship (I don't understand how that's good hehe), working at a job, decided to become a programmer, having bad cravings this week (because of a breakup) and already built a ""gaming pc"". It has all is required to game, but mainly use it to work, program, study and watch movies/videos. And oooh man, that relationship left me emptyyy. I so not know how to get unattached. I mean, I get attached incredibly easy and fast you have no idea... but to get unattached? that's out of the question. For me is like it's never going to happen. But overall I think I'm doing fairly good, this breakup has shaken the branches i'm holding on to. But I thankfully have places where I can come and talk my heart out and vent."

StopGaming,3dgz4v,camerondare,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:09:09 2015 UTC,Hey Jordan :) Welcome to the first day of your life unplugged! If you ever have any trouble just look at some of the success stories on here for inspiration.
StopGaming,3dgq29,slicedrinkingretard,7,Thu Jul 16 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I'm going to try to answer this without coming across as an ass:  There is no ""instant and long-lasting happiness"" activity.  There ARE activities that generate instant gratification, which in turn provide you with a distraction from gaming, subsequently giving you long-lasting happiness. Or at least, that's the theory. What you may be looking for is the bridge between the two, which is a goal.  Let's take playing the guitar for an example. You sit there and maybe you research something to play, you try to play it and you either succeed or fail. This process takes you an hour. You've effectively distracted yourself from gaming for an hour, WOO. While this is good, since it is more productive than gaming, it has no real purpose - so you just kind of feel like you are back at square one when you finish.  Hold onto this thought.  Now we'll use the gym as an example. You go for an hour, the same time frame that you were playing the guitar, BUT you feel better for the day. (I'll momentarily ignore the other benefits of working out and focus on how you probably view the gym versus playing the guitar).  You've spent an hour of time not gaming in both situations, but I'm willing to bet that you view:   watching a movie reading a novel playing the guitar   as ""time spent not gaming"" whereas going to the gym is ""time spent on improvement"". Really, what I'm getting at here is - you view the gym as a goal to be met, whereas the other things you just do to kill time. That's a quick way to deplete your willpower! So here's the plan: instead of just doing things for their own sake, make each activity have a SMART GOAL in order to meet standards of improvement (this is also how ladder style games keep you playing, because they have MEASURABLE SUCCESS STANDARDS!). Instead of just playing the guitar, make it a point that in 3 weeks you will play a song perfectly. If you watch a movie, make it a goal to watch another movie from each of the main actors in the original, or write a review of the movie afterward. Suddenly you aren't wasting time, but using it on improvements that will grant you longer-lasting happiness.  In summation, sorry, there is no magical activity that will grant you eternal happiness. However, you can make every activity a stepping stone towards that end."

StopGaming,3dgq29,Orchid011,2,Thu Jul 16 10:50:31 2015 UTC,"I think if everyone knew the sources of ""instant and long-lasting happiness"" they would be doing that thing all day everyday. So in short, what you're looking for really doesn't exist. But you are a unique individual and might actually have things that give you these feelings, but I don't know you, only you really know you.  So because of that, only you can define ""Happiness"". It seems to be that you're chasing the feeling of instant and long-lasting satisfaction. This is known as hedonism and if this were the most true form of happiness, cocaine addicts would truly be the happiest people in the world.   My personal view of happiness is what neurologist and spirituality enthusiast Sam Harris proposes. It's best explained in this video: ""Sam Harris - The Happiness Experiment"". Essentially he goes onto say that there is more to life than being constantly between pleasure/satisfaction and pain/suffering. Which is essentially a happiness that doesn't rely on the stimulus, but rather a state of mind.   You've probably heard of this before, but true happiness and contentment comes from consistently practicing mindfulness, and you can't just do it every now and then. It's got to be consistent meditation practice every day to really see results. I would recommend my previous post about meditation on r/simpleliving about how to actually get into meditation and mindfulness, but you said you are already do it. So my advice would be to just keep sticking it out and see where it takes you.  Otherwise if meditation and mindfulness just doesn't work for you my other suggestions are:   Start socialising and connecting more with friends/family. Talk to friends/family about your life situation. Form habits with new hobbies in order to reach the state of flow. You don't have to find some sort of ""Passion"", but find something you're somewhat interested in and go from there. See a councillor or a psychologist for help and general life advice. Addiction is a serious issue and should be treated properly.   Good luck man, I wish you all the best bro!"
StopGaming,3dgq29,TheLoneGreyWolf,2,Thu Jul 16 07:50:41 2015 UTC,"hey! activities that leave lasting happiness are hard to find because they cannot be found. Its all in your mind set/ perspective. i will give you an example. i have been teaching privet guitar lessons as my full time job for a bit over half a decade now. A couple years ago when i was in a toxic environment and overall stressful time of my life, i viewed practicing guitar just for fun as a waste of time, as i could be doing it to make money instead by just working with clients. Now i genuinely enjoy guitar practice and feel like its a win win scenario whether i am just jamming, composing, covering a song, etc because the benefits are a spiritual gain more than a ""this will help me earn money blah blah blah. To summarize, try not to think of lasting happiness as ""productive activities"" or ""money generated oriented projects"" and focus more on ""i love doing X because X is meaningful for me."

Gaming is just a crutch, it's what stimulates you enough to procrastinate dealing with the situation. Women and goals aren't going to magically come into your life. They are going to happen by you taking action to make it happen. Gaming isn't going to get you any closer to them... as you've seen by where gaming has brought you to so far.

That's the natural human desire, after spending millions of years struggling to survive.  And you don't fit in the environment you currently live in.  You're not convinced your life matters, and that you need to be doing the best possible thing for yourself and the people you love, maybe because you're really lonely and have no one to love or who loves you.

There's a famous saying:   You're the average of the five people you spend the most time with   And I truly believe in it. This semester you should put some focus into finding an environment that helps you reach your goals. Find people who want to do well and setup a consistent time to hang out with them.  Trust with yourself is built every day. Something you might want to remember is that you need to take moments to recognize yourself when you do the right things. In my last video I talked about the concept of celebrating the small wins and that's what I mean by it. If you do something good but you don't acknowledge yourself for it, you miss out on the trust you could have built in yourself. So even tough you made the right move, you forgot to acknowledge it.  A few things to keep in mind:   Without games you still need to find a way to deal with stress. So watch this video. I schedule my day and I schedule my week. Get a whiteboard in your room to help you stay organized. Focus on scheduling one hour a time. When it comes to studying, I like this post. (Note: Bit of a controversial writer, I'm not a fan of all his stuff but that post is good.) Motivation is a volume knob, not a light switch. To stay motivated you need to follow a few key principles. This video will help.   You mentioned fear. What do you think you're afraid of? Any ideas?"

Step 2- Write out 1-2 other goals you would like to achieve, goals where you have to take action.  For instance- ""Apply to one job per day"".  You can apply online and it's really easy.  Craigslist, Indeed, Glassdoor all have entry level jobs.  Another one would be: ""Go for a walk every day"".  Going for a walk forces you to be around people and is good practice getting comfortable with yourself.  Look at people in the eye and say hi.

The key is to understand that gaming was just an outlet, in the same way the internet is. To truly move on from these you need to figure out why you were gaming in the first place, which has to do with it fulfilling certain needs you have. Without understanding this you'll just find new ways to kill your time, and that can be healthy or unhealthy depending on the circumstance.

Alternatively, you could research how to exercise your ability to control yourself and your urges, so that instead of having to change your environment to be beneficial to yourself, you could find a way to exceed in any environment regardless of its qualities.  Addiction is a manifestation of compulsive escapism that happens when we're unable to exert self control on activities that allow us to escape reality.  Perhaps look into yourself, and look at the series of events of your life that made you into an addict, and try to identify as much as you can.  Through this process of self-reflection, you'll learn about your motivation for actions in the past, and can move forward aware that if you repeat them, you understand the consequences of them.  That understanding will help stop you from becoming an addict again.  To fully quit any addiction is extremely tough, considering how much escapism is accepted by modern society and pushed onto us, so we justify all of our vices through popular approval, and instead of looking to abandon vices all together, people instead judge the vices of others, pretending their own mirrored behavior is somehow better for themselves.  TL;DR - write/type a journal of both your current and past thoughts and actions, come to understand yourself and how you became an addict, settle all thoughts keeping your mind stuck in the past, internalize that knowledge and seek to act on it in everyday life, practice mindfulness in the present with the worries of your past no longer chaining you down, prepare for the unpredictable future"

StopGaming,3d3gxi,RedditTipiak,5,Mon Jul 13 05:36:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a few days short of 5 months but I figure I'll chime in. First, I'd just like to say that life is pretty great. Some days are boring but that's just life; the same can be said when gaming. Overall though I feel the quality of life just went up quite a bit and it's super exciting.   To go a little more in depth on that, I quit during the school year (it's summer break now). Before I quit I'd be gaming until 2am, fall asleep by 3am, and then have to wake up ~7am to school. I would constantly skip class because I was so tired and irritated. When I got home from skipping I'd be to tired to try and read what I missed or catch up on my programming assignments (Comp Sci major) that I'd just tell myself I'll catch up later when I can concentrate and end up playing games for the rest of day. Putting off all my that stuff just built up so much pressure and things to do that I was constantly on edge and nervous and making me toss and turn in bed thinking about it all. After quitting games, I got my sleep schedule back to normal and I felt like a million bucks on most days going to class. This made everything else easier. Just better sleep alone is enough to make me want to quit games. And no, there was no option to just cut myself off at night earlier and go to sleep earlier. Whenever I'd try that I'd just get sucked into the game and push off sleep.  Another positive thing in my life that I am able to attribute to quitting games is that I finally found new passions and simple joys in life. The reason I quit games initially was because I felt I had no passion in life and I didn't know what I liked or didn't like. I was afraid of the daily vicious loop of gaming I was. After I quit I picked up reading books, started playing my guitar more, started going on walks, started going to gym more regularly again, went out with friends more etc. I am so thankful that I found out that I loved to draw. It was always in the back of my mind that it would be something cool to learn but I honestly forgot that it's something that I could just do because I was only just gaming. I am terrible at drawing but it's becoming something I do every day now and I love it regardless of my skill!   Anyways, I can ramble on for a long time about small little details about why I love my life more now. But honestly it's just one of those things you got experience for yourself to appreciate. Me talking about it probably wont do much other than to say it really does feel great! It's pretty much like a fog or a lifeless glaze has lifted up off of you and you can experience the day and new things more than just staring at a screen. I started feeling that way after about 2 or 3 weeks and it's great. Again, it's not a magic bullet and some days will be boring or shitty or whatever - that's life. But overall I'd say it's a sense of freedom of getting out of the need for gaming.  Oh... and the 90 day thing was very real for me. I remember wanting to quit 50 days in because the cravings were terrible and come out of no where. After around 90-110 days, things such seemed to settle down. The first 3 months it can be tricky for a while but really commit to the 90-100 days of completely game free. It worked for me.  As for ""I stop gaming too much, then what?"" question, don't be afraid of it. You'll find things to do. The key is just to think of anything you feel like would be cool and/or fun and DO it. White water rafting trip? Do it. Signing up for Jiu Jitsu lessons? Do it! Taking an art class? Challenging yourself to read a book a week? Do it. Seeing your friends once a week? Easy, do it. What about: learning to better socialize, building a robot, playing an instrument, writing a short story, creating an animation, horseback riding sounds awesome! What about: archery, learning to draw or paint, getting in the best shape of your life, learning to cook like a boss, learning to wood work so you can build a cool chess board, joining a row team, becoming a movie/food/tech blogger,  learning to dance, taking a fishing trip, learning to scuba dive, going to the local zoo and learning about animals etc... There's just so much shit to do and to learn. And it's not because you're just trying to fill the time, it's because the activities you choose to do seem interesting. It's about finding passions and fun things.   My final piece of advice is this /u/RedditTipiak. Take the first few days just visualizing the goals you want in your life. Check out and do he free questionnaire (""The Challenge"") at SuperHero Academy.  I'm not affiliated with them in anyway so don't go crazy and spend any money but the questions listed in the challenge were an awesome help to me on my first day (/u/Camerondare introduced me to it). Anyways just really think about who you want to be if you could be the perfect version of yourself. If things could go exactly the way you want it to be who would you be? Really think about it past the surface gut responses (although those are valid as well). Use that as a starting block to what you want to achieve. Refocus yourself and your mission.   Oh and one (I swear final) final final piece of advice! Don't be afraid to take breaks. You're not a machine, you don't need to be productive all the time. If you're struggling to quit at the beginning and you need to watch all TV all day in order to not play games than do that. You shouldn't be doing that every day but if you have to do it just so you don't game then do that. I was more or less useless my first two weeks of quitting. But my goal was to do whatever I needed to in order to quit and I did. On the days, you feel super bored and just don't know what to do with yourself and you feel like you're going to go crazy... use that boredom as fuel to do something. For me it was drawing, programming, going to the gym or for a walk etc.   Good luck!"

StopGaming,3d3gxi,camerondare,2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"I quit gaming close to 90 days ago. I started playing a major part after graduating highschool and during my senior year. I was extremely stressed out in life.  Gaming was just escapism. When I took a year or two break... I became much more friendly socially and developed more as a human being. I was finding out what I really wanted to do in life.  Removing myself from gaming has helped me deal with my issues, because I have no other choice but to either suck it up, and face it or swallow in my pity. I sometimes have random anxiety/ stress attacks I never used to have before that would last 20-30 minutes and would feel fine. I am honestly very lonely as well since all my friends were on TeamSpeak.  Besides co workers I hang out with no one. I am in a path of transition in my life and quitting gaming to focus on my issues and goals are the best thing ever.  Listen... Gaming is not the fucking problem. It never was and will be. It's like blaming spoons for making people fat and alcohol for getting people to become alcholics. The problem is you and only you.  The only way I had to change my life was to realize... I am the problem. I am the one who needs to change. I am the one who needs to face my issues, illogical fears, and become the strongest Version of yourself.  That's been my overall goal...

StopGaming,3d2yqg,ffathrowy,2,Mon Jul 13 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"I'll start this off pretty generally; relationships consist of two primary needs: physical and emotional. At least, that's how I see it. You need to have a connection on both levels to have a healthy relationship, and when one deteriorates, we tend to seek it out in other ways to fill that void (similar to how gaming fills a void for a lot of us). A lot of what you're saying leads me to believe that your relationship is lacking because he can't fulfill the emotional obligation due to his gaming, and I'm going to assume that he's probably not fulfilling the physical ones as well. Essentially, the foundation of your relationship is nonexistent (according to my philosophy at least).  Let's see what we can do about it.  First off, I am a firm believer in the approach that you shouldn't offer someone an ultimatum, at least initially and not as bluntly as many people put it. 'Games or Me' is probably not the most effective approach, since it seems to want an immediate response that many people will simply be unable to handle. However, if it really comes down to it, you may find yourself in this position, which it seems you've at least considered by saying you have 'serious doubts' about your relationship.   He has all but stopped the hobbies that he had when we first got together; he jogs sometimes, reads the occasional fantasy book, and watches anime   Okay, so he has some hobbies that you both shared a common interest in. Awesome! Let's use these as a bridge to try and deter some gaming activity.   Hey do you want to go for a jog/go to the gym? Let's watch XYZ anime / go to the movies. Let's go to the bookstore and find some books.    I think it basically stems from an impulse towards escapism.   You're probably right about this, which is why we're going to give him reasons not to escape.  Even if you can take away one day of gaming, it becomes a step in the right direction. Maybe you can find a convention to go to, or go to gym classes on a consistent basis to have a schedule of times when you can't game. As many people will say, if you can find a social activity to keep you occupied, gaming becomes less and less attractive as an option. Try to encourage little dates as much as possible, anything that removes him from the computer. Just find ways to get him out of the house at first.  If you can get this to work, I think you can salvage something in your relationship to begin with. I'm not saying the gaming will stop completely overnight, but if you can gradually make these changes, you might find the person you fell for buried in that shell they are in now.   Now this all being said, if you don't see an effort to change on his part, after a good faith effort on yours, then you may find yourself saying Games or Me, (which would be warranted). IF that doesn't motivate him to change his behavior, I think you have your answer. But all you can do in the meantime is give it a shot, hopefully he finds his way here before it's too late."

For many though who are in the limbo state 90 days works great just to get them moving in that direction, and over the 90 days as their brain fog [from gaming] wears off they will be in a better headspace to make a more logical decision about whether they want to continue gaming or not in the future - which tends to be not to continue gaming.

I can't tell you how many times I relapsed when I got serious enough about quitting to stop trying alone because I literally lost count of how many times it happened.  Maybe the only thing I did right was refuse to give up, but it sure worked out in the end.  Relying on willpower never worked out well for me either, and waiting till I found enough strength to do it all by myself would probably have wound up literally killing me.  Why?  Because willpower-first methods don't work for me, and I've yet to find a problem that I can't make worse by gaming.  I hope things work out for you in the end."

I tried managing my gaming on my own for a long time.  I couldn't.  It helps to have help.  These forums are helpful, and it's good to connect with people.  For me, I like connecting with people in real time, so I go to online meetings and make phone calls to other addicts so that I can get the support I need to stay off games and keep my life moving forward.  Addiction isn't just something that we do too much and need to replace with something else.  That would be a problem, which can be fairly easily solved.  Addiction is a brain malfunction which involves various systems in the brain, including the decision-making system.  Stress pushes us into it, the intensity of the activity or substance itself pulls us, and then our brains don't really work right so we end up not being able to control it, stop when we want to, etc.  It takes time and effort and support to change something that strong, something that entrenched in our brains.  What it has taken for me is significant connection with a community of other people committed to recovery from gaming addiction, and I needed to learn a new way of living, a new way of handling my problems.  I'm still learning it.  But I'm hugely better than I was three years ago, thanks to my community.  Best wishes.  Maybe I'll see you at a meeting."

I am 10 months sober of alcohol and the first 4 months were an emotional override due to the rapid physiological changes, but outside of that there was no magical or divine intervention that swept me to a better future.  I've just learned to actively engage in healthier habits to live right.  I'm on day 2 of no gaming or fapping.  I don't expect some magical deliverance; I expect to be more focused on bettering my life through even more healthier habits.

As I've heard in AA:  If the only thing an alcoholic (or addict) does is stop drinking, the only thing that has changed is the odor of their breath.  That is why there is a simple 12 step program which if you work it, then yes, miracles or ""magic"" change as you say, does occur.  When we stop an addiction, we are left with the main problem as described as ""restless, irritable, and discontent"".  Unless we move forward and work the steps, then yea, doesn't feel too good or worth it, and we can white knuckle it for awhile but are very very likely to go back into addiction - who wouldn't feeling that way.  It does work when you work it.  As step 2 would say, ""are you willing to believe"" that and do the rest of the steps or would you prefer not to.  The choice is ours.  Why not test it out and see if it does work.  As I was told, take the next 90 days and put your effort into working the steps to the best of your ability and if after doing so, it doesn't work, we'll gladly refund your misery.  I'm still here after over a year game free and sober from alcohol and more importantly, am pretty happy and comfortable in my own skin for a change.  If it worked for me, it can for you or anyone."

I quit on 9th July though I don't know why my badge hasn't updated. I was in a very similar position. I have a mild form of insomnia which means I sleep for like an hour or two each day. The rest of the time I spent gaming. Wake up at 9 eat breakfast at computer, eat lunch at computer and eat dinner at  computer. Try to sleep for a while and then rinse and repeat. I didn't get anything severe as you but I do have horrible dark circles. They're black holes almost. My first day post quitting was pretty depressing. First I sold my steam account, which was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. Believe me I almost cried.  I just lay in bed browsing the Internet with absolutely nothing to do,bored out of my mind when I realized this was no better than when I was gaming. So on the second day I bought a guitar, joined a gym and planning on learning driving after two years of procrastinating . I pretty much dislike all of this but have to find some way of keeping myself busy, to take my mind off of games so I don't relapse again. When I do get that pang of going back I'll probably just pinch myself hard or get out of the house. My next stop is ways of dealing with social anxiety and interacting with people.

StopGaming,3cwfe1,camerondare,2,Sat Jul 11 11:33:17 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Thanks for the post, I'll try and give you a brief rundown of my experience having my own businesses the last 7 years or so, which started around a year after I quit gaming.  Quitting gaming was a major catalyst for me to start my own business, not directly but because it was a step where I recognized that I had a vision for my life that didn't involve gaming. At first my main goal was to learn how to make friends (I didn't have very good social skills back then) so I started working on that, and a year later having made some progress (detailed here), I started to wonder what else I wanted for my life, and being my own boss (freedom + flexibility) was big up on that list.  I wanted the option to be spontaneous and take the weekend off or to not have to make that awkward phone call to work when I was sick. So really I wanted to work for myself and figured I might as well started learning that too.  Now that I knew I wanted to work for myself I started trying to figure out how to do that. Essentially I needed to start my own business. At first I had no idea what to do for a business, I had no skills and I hadn't even graduated high school (I dropped out twice due to gaming and never went back.) I was 19ish at the time.  So if I wanted to work for myself I needed to start my own business and if I wanted my own business I needed a product to sell. I know that seems like common sense but that's the extent of the model and having that framework is important, even if it's basic.  Now what should I sell? That was what I needed to figure out and the easiest way to find this is by focusing on someone else's pain. If you can solve someone's pain, you can create a new business. There's many different examples of this.  All I did was begin to explore this question and luckily at the time I was learning how to improve my social skills and helped to organize a meetup every week, so I was finding other guys who had similar struggles. They started to ask me to coach and I launched a business around helping them learn how to connect more with people. When I started I had no idea what I was doing, no biz experience or anything, so I did the only thing I could: learn on the fly.  So I read books and applied it to my experience. I'll list a few good ones below.  I just want to say that there's never been a time in history with the opportunity to start your own business and work for yourself as now, and everything you could ever need to learn is available for free online. The point isn't to ""have talents"" as much as it's about building the skills you need.  Here's a brief overview of how I make my income online:  1) For six years I've had a company called Kingpin Social where I worked with guys (mainly between 24-32 years old) to help them improve their social skills, relationships and lifestyle. In 2012 we had six full time employees and it was a six-figure business. A few years ago the team wasn't working out as well as I wanted and now it's just me. I still do some coaching 1 on 1 when there's a motivated student who is a good fit with me, but I'm only working with 1 or 2 on a biweekly basis now compared to the 100 students I used to have each year.  2) Freelance/Web Design work. This is mainly for friends who want help with it and I outsource all the work, taking my cut for being the project manager. I also write for addiction.com and they pay me per article.  3) Wheat Free Mom. I have a site with my mom where we share gluten free recipes. We have cookbooks, etc. She creates the recipes, I do all the rest mostly.  4) Game Quitters. This is my new project and the one I'm dedicating the majority of my time towards. Just building resources and tools to support the community. I've been answering questions on the topic since 2011 when I released my article on How to Quit Playing Video Games FOREVER and now I'm dedicating time to creating more value for the community. (If you haven't seen the YouTube channel, check it out here.)  I'm currently writing a book on the subject. I hope to use the book into speaking engagements at high schools around the world. (I did a TEDx talk on the subject previously.) I have a guide I put together as the follow-up to my article called Respawn and I just released the Game Quitters Challenge, a 30-day challenge to turn your life into the ultimate video game by completing 30 missions that help you develop courage, discipline, social intelligence, contribution and tenacity.  I have a lot of big dreams and ideas with Game Quitters I hope to build into the community over time, like finding a way to have a social impact component to it built right into the business model - other than simply just the impact it has through the community. An example is like TOMS one for one model. Initial ideas just during brainstorming is using a % of the revenue from Game Quitters to support the underfunded suicide hotline, or something along those lines. The social impact side is much more important to me than the business side. I also recognize that a sustainable business allows me to spend more time and focus on building the project and impacting more people (compared to me spending more time with coaching clients outside the community) and that money is not evil if you leverage capital for good. Mentors of mine are like The Unreasonable Group and other social entrepreneurs.  Anyways, for your own business at least initially you want to think about building skills and leveraging those to provide value, which you can then be paid for providing. Multiple streams is really the key. They all add up over time. The key is to focus on developing different skills that you can offer as services. And then learning how to leverage outsourcing and other people with skills so you can add additional services, etc.  Just like anything, if you truly want to make progress in it, focus on the process and follow The Slight Edge framework (Jeff Olson's book, also highly recommended) of improving 1% each day. I'm currently writing this from Shanghai in China because I have the opportunity to work for myself and do it from anywhere in the world. But this has happened from me working on it almost every day the last 7 years. For example, yesterday I traveled for 20 hours, and 80% of that time I was listening to a value-packed podcast on business/personal development, reading a specific book that could help me with something I'm working on right now or literally working on a project (I edited the new Game Quitters welcome video on the plane.) During any of those hours I could have easily justified watching a movie or anything else, but it's in this choice, every day, that you either create the life you want for yourself or you don't. The choice is yours, I truly believe that.  Here are a few good resources to start with if you're interested:  The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau.  The Art of Non-Conformity by Chris Guillebeau  Tim Ferriss' Blog and book, the 4 Hour Work Week.  Chris Guillebeau's blog  Sean Ogle's blog: Location 180  There are also a number of good podcasts to listen to:  Internet Business Mastery  Smart Passive Income with Pat Flynn  Hope that helps you out.

You have been gaming for a long time and your thinking patterns adopt your life style so it's very difficult to imagine life without games when you are addicted.   There is no sudden visible change in life when you quit. There comes a period where cravings and regret sets in but it passes. The most important next step is almost always filling in the void. Be it some hobby or spending more time with your family.   Usually one addiction replaces another, you leave games and get addicted to youtube or movies or seasons. You need to have a plan and a solid understanding of why you want to quit. Are you doing it just for the sake of it or do you really like to live your life fully where one hobby doesn't take major chunk of it. You have to find answers before you quit."

There's no waste of time, she is always occupied with part-time work, housework, garden. but all those things are only relevant here and now. Absolutely noble for people around, but have no relevance to her personally whatsoever. She's not learning new skills, not spending any time for herself.

Not even slightly, there's always work around the house. I am not judging, but it feels as if she avoided being by herself.  Gaming is not always the main problem. Most people have their own ways of loosing time anyway. You could spend 50 years quitting gaming trying to make sense of things and not do any better than if you did, 'cause at the end nothing matters."

Make sure you stay aware of how much you play. Being able to moderate once when you're willpower is high is different than being able to moderate over time as your brain continues to enjoy gaming the more you play.  Just a note on your tip. As much as I encourage people to try moderation if they want, I would not recommend trying after 10 days, and instead elect for 90 days. The reason is what research shows us about the way our brains interact with gaming and how 90 days is a good benchmark to give our brains a sufficient amount of time to recalibrate back to normal dopamine sensitivity levels.  Now this is definitely all relative to you, how much you gamed and the environmental vulnerabilities that caused your gaming to get out of control, but just as a general rule of thumb 90 days is what I would recommend.  Does everyone need 90 days? Absolutely not, but the second half of my argument would be that because gaming has likely played (no pun intended) such a large role in our lives up until this point, this 90 days not only gives us a real experience of what life is like without games (which for many of us we may have never experienced before, or not for a long, long time), which allows us the opportunity to see if continuing to game (in moderation) is even what we truly want (compared to just simply what we know), AND lastly, 90 days is a challenge. If you can't get to 90 days without gaming you probably shouldn't be gaming, just as a simple exercise in discipline.  Anyways, some food for thought. Hope your journey continues to go well. Post us another update soon. :)"

Also, I agree with you and your 90 day detox plan, that can definitely work for the more 'hardcore' and addicted gamers. But as to me, as I had said in my previous post, I already tried this 'quit gaming' thing and I was able to do it for 1.5 months straight but my mindset got the better of me and I relapsed. This time around I intend to play games solely when all my tasks are done and when I have nothing to do. But the thing is, I do like gaming, it's enjoyable and specially sports games with my friends that's why I don't give up completely but I WILL NOT fall back to a competitive, video/stream watching, tactical mindset.

Going to the gym keeps me focused on doing the daily work required for the greater long term change of life.  And I would say I get a high from working out as endorphins seem to be firing like crazy at the satisfaction I feel after a workout.

When I was 19 my social life sucked and it was a major reason why I quit gaming (I wanted to improve it.)  On the gaming/life boredom front, make sure you read this post.  Next, on the social side, check out this post and here are a few suggestions that helped me:   Focus on learning what you need to learn to get to where you want to be. It starts with recognizing where you are at, and where you want to go. And then learning what you need to to get there.   Becoming a social person doesn't just happen. It's something you have to work at. Think about it like you are the character you get to build in this world, you have different skills and talents, and to improve them you need to go on missions and quests to complete. If you want to improve your social skills, you need to go on missions that will help you facilitate that. You have to take action. Try meetups and get out of the house more.   Read How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, read The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson, Listen to The Art of Charm podcast.  Start hanging out in environments where you can meet people (I like cafes personally) and practice interacting with every person you talk to. At first your conversations might only be 20 seconds and that's fine. Let them build over time. Every day you talk to people, so by putting just a little bit more intention behind it, you can see major improvements over time."

I had these social skills that just made me friends with everyone.  It was a great time of my life, but as I went into my younger 20s, I fell to alcoholism, gaming, and ultimately social isolation.  I actually developed a bit of a stutter and lost my self-esteem when I started trying to interact with others again last year after sobering up.  I actually still go to AA purely to practice my interactions with people.  I can feel myself slowly getting better at this stuff again and it feels promising and offers hope.

What I've found that has worked best for me is focusing on bringing a little bit more intention to every interaction I have and focusing on connecting in a more meaningful way as much as possible with every person I talk to. Every day we have so many opportunities, the cashier, the barista, our friends/family, random people sitting/standing next to us... that if we just focus on having a meaningful conversation with each of them, whether that's for 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 2 minutes, 20 minutes, 2 hours, it all adds up over time and gives us a way to learn and practice.

StopGaming,3cri5d,noobcrusher,2,Fri Jul 10 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I can offer some insight into this, as I'm in somewhat of a similar position.  I really enjoy eSports as a community and how far it has come. Games give hope to those who might not mesh with traditional sports. Competitive game play through tournaments and other events bring people together to create communities which can do beautiful things. In fact, I want to focus on intellectual property and eSports (which is really just a branch off of entertainment & contract law) in law school.   And so we come to the dilemma. Do I need to cut video games out completely? Is it possible to moderate game play, or will I become addicted again? I'm very passionate about X, but that passion might also cause me to take an emotional roller coaster, is this healthy? Etc.  Here's just MY thoughts on it: we are a community of healing and rebuilding the spirit. What gaming offered us was an easily accessible, social and goal-driven opportunity, fulfilling something we lacked (usually social). You can just fire up the console/PC and play other people, whether they be friends or strangers, in an environment that offered clearly defined hierarchies (ladder rankings) which in turn gave you a measure of your success (read = self-worth). As we give in to this system, our willpower is eroded because we believe that our worth is directly related to how good we are at the game (this was my case), or we believe that our only friends exist in a virtual world and we begin to neglect important REAL world actions. This cycle then repeats, as we want to further escape the real world, we dive further and further into the virtual one and it takes an immense amount of willpower to get yourself out of that hole.  Games are not the issue at hand, nor is porn the issue when someone talks of nofap, or is the object generally the issue when it comes to an addiction.  BEFORE I CONTINUE - the former sentence may seem extraordinarily vague, and, quite frankly wrong in some cases. Yes, drugs and alcohol that cause physiological and chemical reactions that lead to an addiction, similarly with porn and gaming causing excess dopamine release and eventual desensitization to stimuli, requiring more and more to get the same effect are a HUGE part of addiction - I get that, but there is an element of willpower involved and that is what I am really trying to focus on here, and also what I feel we are all more focused on here.  What we've lost is our ability to control our surroundings. We feel like we HAVE to play games. We feel like we HAVE to PMO. No, we don't. We're just weak and got comfortable in a routine. We decided to kill time instead of investing it. And now we realize there are much better things to do with all this time, and we realize that there are goals in the real world that we want to obtain. There's this want/need dichotomy that we've lost along the way, and the separation between the two is merely our willpower. I want to play a video game right now, I do. But I don't need to, so I'm choosing not to. I'm going to go study for my LSAT. Man, I really want to PMO right now. But I don't need to. So I'm choosing not to. I'm gonna go to the gym.   Apologies for the tangent there. My point is this: gaming isn't bad, it's our reaction to it that becomes harmful. Quite frankly I have some awesome memories from playing video games, just as you probably have some great VFX ideas from playing games. We both just got a little overzealous and lost sight of what games did for us, and became a little too immersed in the environment. I think going cold turkey for a ""reboot"" period would be very beneficial - and then perhaps try doing it in moderation, but if you see yourself putting in more hours gleefully gaming versus working on your art - go back to cold turkey. Against what may be commonly said here - I don't think moderation is evil - I think it's the next step. Stopping to gather the willpower to fully control the issue.

Involved in the gaming industry but has a healthy relationship with it. I recorded a podcast with Locke here you'd learn something from.  Remember that ""addiction"" has to do with vulnerabilities in your life that caused you to be in a position to become ""addicted."" So regardless of being involved in the industry or not, you need to identify why you were drawn to gaming (when it became unhealthy) and heal those reasons first before going back into gaming in ""moderation.""  Hope that helps."

StopGaming,3cpeqt,AN_HONEST_COMMENT,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"The title to the video is VERY mis-leading. I found his message was more geared towards society's views on addiction and how to deal with drugs in general. I like that he's promoting the discussion of not ""punishing"" addicts with drug laws. It SHOULD be seen as a health problem and just like the example he used, putting the money our government used for the drug war into rehabilitating these people and job-skill training. That makes sense.  However, his anecdote about social isolation doesn't hold much weight imo. I have no doubt that being isolated socially will increase the chances of someone latching onto something in an addictive way. But just as many addicts are quite social people.  Look at alcoholics who go to bars regularly feeding their addiction, but they're in an environment that is widely associated with ""going out and socializing"". If I told an alcoholic they should go out and socialize more to help with their addiction they'd laugh, understandably.  In my own experience, I had a natural social charisma that just deteriorated over time BECAUSE of my addiction.  During one of my ""moderation/changing myself"" periods, I was  literally going out and trying to socialize more...but unfortunately, the damage had already been done at that point. Feeling comfortable in my own skin after well over a decade of a self-induced prison of addiction was not going to happen without some sort of recovery, which has absolutely led me to regaining social confidence.  I'm glad to see people talking more about the overall problem of drug addiction and the way society handles it though. To me, the ""Drug War"" is an utter failure and makes no sense whatsoever."

I for example would have never ""sacrifised"" so much time of my holidays to do some unsalaried work, because I would certainly want to game 24/7.

I did the same things like you: Reading books, listening to podcasts, improve my english/spanish, went swimming (alone), working out.. the list could go on forever.   I noticed that these things are not satisfying me anymore and I realized that these activities all shared one thing in common: they are all lonely.

Next: I committed myself to the task with affirmations and rid myself of mental ""back-doors"". I sought out people I deemed as authorities for advice: an addiction therapist and it helped that people here and Cam (camerondare) corroborated ideas from the therapist; also it's easy to view Cam as an authority, all things considered.

StopGaming,3cjdwb,noflyinginthehouse,3,Wed Jul 8 11:05:48 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I definitely feel that some games have a stronger propensity to harbour addiction (e.g: competitive games like LoL/CSGO or achievement based games like Runescape/other MMORPGs) than others - say to sports games such as Fifa.  Normally what creates the pull for addiction is the immersive nature of the games and for most people sports games are played in the same room with a friend so they are less immersed in the game rather they are more doing an activity with their friends (so to speak).  That said an addict can and will get addicted to sports games (e.g Football manager has a reputation for this).    As for your second question I don't think you can force someone to go cold turkey. That person has to come to their own realisation as to why they no longer want to game (e.g an activity is more interesting/fun or gaming is not aligned with their long term goals).  In your case you must understand that children will resent any kind of authority in that manner and will actively seek to defy it. I am sure many of us on here would have memories of gaming after we were supposed to go to bed etc when we are younger. I would recommend instead of taking the 'stick' approach to instead take the 'carrot' approach and encourage them to get involved with fun activities so that gaming seems boring in comparison (that way they choose to not game rather than are being forced by there parents)."

Cooking his own food, doing his own laundry, cleaning and performing household maintenance. If you want to displace gaming, you need an influx of reality to take its place.  This is the only way you can ""force"" someone to grow up - natural consequences. Every addict has an army of enablers behind him, so your first job is to remove yourself from that crowd."

But yeah I think MOBAs are highly addictive, especially LoL and Dota because of the competitive ladder, their popularity around the world which breeds celebrities that young gamers look up to. These esports celebrities make millions and have no shortage of girls, and  young gamers want to be like them, just pouring thousands of hours into playing, learning, watch streams, improving their skills and hope to dominate the game like their professional idols.  If you asked the gamer to quit cold turkey, I'd imagine it's extremely hard because their whole world is entrenched in the game. They read and chat about it in online forums, their friends play the game, and they follow the latest tournaments that are televised live. You can ask them to quit, but I don't think they will."
StopGaming,3ciwia,Xale1990,2,Wed Jul 8 07:00:48 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for joining us here! All of your friends being gamers is a common problem we all run into. To quit there are two ways to deal with this: 1) Find a way to stay friends with your current friends (with new channels) and 2) Find a way to make new friends. I share more about this in this video.  What you want to know is that gaming fulfills many different kinds of activities all in one. It's mentally stimulating, goal oriented and you can do it when you're tired at home. So the solution is to find a few different activities to replace it. Photography and jogging are good, but you'll want to choose something to do at home when you're bored/tired as well. Here's a good list of home activities.  For me personally, I have my own business that I put a lot of time into, I travel around the world full-time (so I'm usually off exploring during free time), I learned how to DJ, I read a lot of books, watch documentaries and TED talks, hang out with friends, do a lot of writing, amongst others.

StopGaming,3ciwia,sharkbag,2,Thu Jul 9 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"Your plan to start earlier makes sense. It takes the load and pressure out of your trip being a cure-all (which rarely works anyway). Maybe you can take the mindset that you are preparing and changing for the trip rather than waiting for the trip to change you :)  As for what to do with your time, I have the same problem. It's difficult especially when your social circles are heavily invested.  When I feel restless and get the urge, I try to drop everything I'm doing and go for a walk. Just to get outta the house. I figure that if I can rationalize spending the time gaming, I have the time for a walk. So that's my short term emergency response.  Longer term I've joined a martial arts gym. It's something I've wanted to do for years but never really took the plunge. So I reckon maybe you can try that - something you have been wanting to do, but have always explained away or been too lazy to commit to.   I guess it works in concert with why you're changing your life to get gaming out of it, or change your relationship to it. Meditation is good, and maybe on your walk you can go to a coffee shop, sit down and give yourself the time to do nothing at all. Bring some paper and doodle, or write some reflections.   Sorry for the word vomit. Good luck!"

Gaming gives you a lot of instant gratification, which is one of the main reasons why you play, and after you quit you can run into a struggle of not being able to find those same feelings that gaming once gave you - especially because not only are games specifically designed for instant gratification, but the dopamine you get from it trains your brain to seek that out.

StopGaming,3cf3ce,NateJagger,4,Tue Jul 7 12:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yknow, the beauty of /r/nofap and /r/stopgaming are that they are hard.   You have a compulsive behaviour, maybe it is an actual addiction, or perhaps you just want to get back control. These activities haveeroded your willpower and simply by saying that you are going to try to be different, to be a better you, you make a big first step that many are too afraid to take because its ""too hard.""  When you feel like you're about to break, when those urges kick up (and trust me, I'm in the same boat as you friend) you tell yourself...yeah, I could play a game, yeah I could PMO...anyone can do that.  But I'm not just anyone. I have goals that I'm going to accomplish...for whatever reason you have for doing them. Not everyone has the willpower for that.  If you feel like your willpower is being drained, or is finite and you can't hold them both down at once...here's some advice. The first week is brutal...especially if you have nothing to do on the weekends and even more so if you are doing nofap and cutting the cord. You have to find something to take your mind out of the situation...go out for a run, go to the movies, etc. Once the first week passes you will pretty much feel invincible and then just have to fight the little urges, but never underestimate them...they are more dangerous because you get comfortable and start thinking that one game or PMO is okay.  Lastly, if you are going to relapse, I want you to remember something. If you are at that point...remember how it feels after you win or lose a game or PMO. Remember that feeling. Then think about how fleeting that is. How meaningless in the grand scheme of things it is. Think about having to reset your badge and all things associated with that. Remember it all.  It's all okay. Relapsing isn't the end, it's just a setback...if no one ever relapsed it wouldn't be hard. It wouldn't mean anything.   The beauty of this process is that its hard, that not many can go through with it. And at the end of it all when someone asks you why, you need only say:  Because I could.  Best of luck mate."

I've been through some stuff in my life and I felt the need to share some of it online, strictly anonymous though. But maybe you can find some truth in there for you too.   ""I want to show my surroundings that I feel good and that I feel accomplished.  I guess it comes from the anxiety that comes in the wake of having your entire life flipped around. Suddenly you are on the flip side of things and you need to reaffirm your footing. That is kind of how I feel right about now. And in a way that is good. It is progress. Finding a way of channelling build up energy - be it positive or negative - into your work and daily routines is good. Otherwise it just goes out the window much like hot air in a chill winter night.   And hot air goes upwards. Maybe this energy will carry my spirits up and away so I will be able to see new horizons in my life. I guess that is actually what I want. I want to be able to catch my breath and view things from a different perspective.  ""The hardest person to motivate is yourself.""  I guess that is just about as true as it gets. Constantly motivating yourself to achieve change is a hard challenge to take on. But at the end of the day the only one who can truly change things is one self.  I recently had a lengthy discussion on the addiction to gaming and general laziness. I often tell people that I have had periods of my life where I spent a huge amount of time on doing nothing. And by nothing I mean almost literally nothing at all. Zero productiveness. A complete and utterly waste of time but more essentially a waste of life.  I firmly believe that we have this one life and one chance on this planet. After the fat lady has sung her last verses the stage light is turned off and the crowd clear out and that is that. An empty hall with no lights. Nothing happens. You die, you get put in the ground and eventually all of the people who will have ever met you will kick the bucket too and you will pass on into oblivion like that billions of other sorry sots before you.  So you only get this one chance to live the life that you want. And it does not matter about material things such as money or expensive cars. All that matters is that you are happy and have a positive perspective on things.   Let's take a moment to discuss habits. Now the way I view habits is the same way I view food. There is awesome food that will make you want to eat yourself to death and is good for you, and then there is the bad stuff that you can only get yourself to stuff in your head if you have had at least half a keg of beer.  If you are one of those people who constantly feel too unachieved and too lazy to do anything about it, you have probably filled your life - and face - with bad habits. For the sake of my argument I will discuss the habit of being addicted. And because it is way more common than you will probably believe, I have focussed on gaming-addiction.  First of all, you have to change your habits. Having quit gaming isn't necessarily enough. You need to fundamentally change your old habits. And it will take time.  You have probably been in the loop for far too long for it not to take some time and adjustment. Look at it as if you were trying to build up your body from scratch. How would you go about doing so?  You'll need food for the mind and food for the body.  Your gaming has made you feel good about yourself because you felt somewhat accomplished when you won a game or completed a mission. Chemically this released Dopamin in your brain telling you that you did good. When we were bashing each other's heads in with rocks and clubs, Dopamin was a good thing because it made us survive as releasing the drug into our brains made us refrain from sit on one's hands.   But because we have evolved and society has too, the benefits for our brain's craving for Dopamin and other ""Prozac""-like (fluoxetine) chemicals have been diminished. Instead a lot of people now feel entrapped by these drugs and are facing hard odds ever getting out of the loop unless they take active action.  As an avid gamer you probably also have friends online or at least have played with other people on a regular basis which means that at least some of your natural social needs were covered. This is one of the other reasons why gaming can be so addicting. Were you instead spending your time on a less social and competitive hobby like book reading, you would probably incentive to seek other stimulus to meet your needs.  So what can you do about it?  Well for one you can find something that gives your mind the same nourishment and nurturing. Something that tells your mind and body that what you are doing right now - away from your computer and especially away from gaming - is good and better.  Secondly; you can do whatever you like with your free time. Remember that.  Seeing as you are probably a regular person who is kind of average all round, you probably have not realised this yet, or truly embraced the notion, but the biggest adventure-game of all time is right outside your front door.  You might live in a boring neighbourhood in a boring small town in the middle of Nowhere-ville or in the midst of a Manhattan-like metropolis, but it really doesn't matter. There's tons of stuff to do besides sitting in front of a computer or television screen all day.  If you are normally bored and need entertainment, you honestly stop thinking about it that way. Instead of feeling that there is nothing to do, and that you are bored, think of it as free time. What do you want to do with your free time?  What skills have you always wanted to learn? Cooking? Skating? Language skills? Speed-seduction?  What sports have you always wanted to try out? Here's a list of sports you could try. I fucking guarantee you that there is someone doing one of those sports near you, right now.  Instead of spending maybe 5-10 hours á day in a fictional universe with rules set up by developers and money-chugging companies you now have an open world with 7,325,176,800 players as of right now.  If you are bored, get away from your computer or couch, away from your desk, up out of your room and get the fuck out there into the world and do something different for a change.  ""If you do what you have always done, the result will never change.""  Damn right. You know how I got this perspective on things?  I jumped out of a plane at 13000 feet. That will show you some perspective and make you realize that life is only boring if YOU make it so. The problem is always in our heads and you need to figure out how to rewire yourself.  Be it meditation and mindfulness or be it something completely different, you simply have to stop telling yourself that you are bored because there is nothing to do. It is a petitio principii, a fallacy.  You keep thinking you are bored because you are telling yourself that there is nothing to do, yet there is lots of stuff to do but you are just too focused on being bored to actually do something different for a change;  And thus you end up confirming yourself in the notion that there is nothing for you to do which again leads you to (tadaaaaaaa) FEEL BORED.  What you are experiencing when you are just about to relapse is a psychological phenomenon called Extinction Bursts, and you need to know and acknowledge that if you relapse, you will have a much harder time quitting next time.  You are addicted, and you need to treat it like an addiction otherwise your mind and body will never be free from it.  ""There's never nothing going on, and boredom is an insult to oneself.""  Now go be the person you've always wanted to be. Be the action hero from your last game."""

StopGaming,3cdifd,MrGobelsack,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing. Having identified your love for music is really cool and will make a big difference for you.  I don't know the answer to your question but from your post it sounds like gaming (or just online entertainment) in general is your way to escape or avoid doing what you want. Maybe it's from anxiety you feel, maybe your love for music scares you because what if you actually did put all these hours into it...  What I would suggest is start small in two ways:   Meditate each day for 10 minutes. The science behind proves it helps with anxiety immensely. This will help you stay a bit more grounded. Instead of trying to replace your current habit (10 hours today) with 10 hours of music, start with 30 minutes each day of music. That will help you see a bit more progress and over time you will be able to put more time into music. Otherwise this is just overwhelming. Try the Pomodoro Technique.   When you combine Gaming/Online Ent as your way to deal with any emotions you're experiencing (like anxiety) and it's your way to procrastinate, it's easy to get caught just killing time in front of your computer instead of doing what you really want to do.  This might not be the whole answer, but is something worth exploring. I found a lot of success in scheduling my day and being more aware of my time and what I'm actually doing with it. If I'm just like ""I have 10 hours today of free time and I'm going to DJ (DJing was my new passion after gaming)"" it was easy for me to just check FB, reddit, etc instead of diving into it because I only had to do it for an hour. Then I'd take a break, go for a walk, then do another hour, etc.  If this continues to not work, there's no shame in seeing a counsellor and getting their perspective too."
StopGaming,3cdifd,camerondare,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer!   Indeed, maybe I'm really just putting way to much pressure on myself. It's as if I had to make music. And because I don't do it I only get frustrated which in return leads to more gaming. Maybe I should just try to relax.  You need to understand my situation though. I just graduated, am 18 years old, and now want to prepare for music school. I want to make music my profession. All the while there are a bazillions other important things, since I live alone, I work, I want to move out of this apartment, etc.  Probably the only way to go is to just do it. But not the Shia LaBoeuf JUST DO IT. But instead a more relaxed stance."
StopGaming,3cdifd,Varioque,2,Tue Jul 7 10:14:38 2015 UTC,"Also remember the important fact, which I assume you are already very aware of, but wanted to add just to be sure. Speaking as a non-performing wannabe author, any creative medium, be it art, music, photography, writing... Is very, very hard. Even becoming decent at it can be a frustrating journey depending on your talent going into it.  This is a very well-stressed point on StopGaming as well, so forgive me if I am just reiterating what you already know, but one of the often overlooked issues with quitting games is not only the ""what do I do now""-question, but the fact that playing games is usually a lot easier than developing a skill, especially if you, as I am, a gamer since I could barely even stand up properly.  I want to second Camerondare's tip below* about going after your passion in small steps mainly because of this. Becoming good at something is abhorrently painful most of the time, and you will (cheesy as it sounds) fail 99 times for each time you succeed. On the bright side you are still relatively young compared to most people here (I would guess), so you have a lot of time ahead of you. Cultivate your love for music, don't quench it by trying too hard.  *P.s, my third or so post at Reddit, so I apologize if I am unaware of any posting conventions or lingo I would be better of using."

There's a reason why you are trying to escape from reality, or playing games, or masturbating, or watching porn, and until you identify what that is and heal it you're likely to continue the cycle.

Once it gets here, my ability to think like a sane person is greatly reduced.  Second, instead of assuming that any plan I come up with is automatically a good plan, bounce that plan off of somebody who understands what it's like to be a gaming addict (i.e. another gaming addict).  That person will spot most (or even all) the holes in my thinking that I can't spot myself.  Third, include in my plan plenty of things that will help me not game today (spending time around other recovering game addicts, doing enjoyable things that don't involve a computer, spend time with friends, etc.).  Fourth, remember that it's okay to not turn my computer on today if I know that I'm not in a good place (since turning it on will likely lead to me gaming).  Just some thoughts.

Just a question though in the spirit of keeping each other accountable, helping each other get through this and motivating each other. I looked at the detail's on the website for what I am assuming is your account? It says that you went 0-1 today implying you played a game today. I'm not sure what your goals are or if you're trying moderation (which is fine if that's what you want to do) but couldn't help myself not to ask about it lol. Was it a slip up? 9 days off of games is so so good and such a great start that I don't want to see you fall back into a bad routine!

Gaming became an activity with diminishing returns for me as well, and I wound up spending a lot of time gaming even after I reached the point where I didn't actually enjoy the gaming particularly anymore.  I gamed so I could be numb and escape the pain that pervaded my life.  I felt like I was a useless drag on society, and that nobody would ever want anything to do with me.  I thought I was pathetic/stupid/worthless because I was incapable of staying away from games.  I never expected a whole bunch of the things that happened to me, but that didn't stop any of them from happening.  Self-hatred was my default reaction to anything and everything bad that happened in my life.  Put it all together, and I can safely say that I was light-years away from being happy, joyous, and free.  Today, I haven't touched a game in just over 18 months.  When I hit real-world obstacles that once would have made me game, I have the ability to handle them without gaming (or using my other addiction).  My emotional life is no longer dominated by things like self-hatred, self-pity, depression, and suicidal thinking.  Not only that, but when I find these kinds of thoughts cropping up in my head, it doesn't take long before I find myself going ""huh...I'm feeling really negative right now...I wonder what's going on?""  At that point, I can step away from my thinking and talk things over with somebody who gets my addiction...an action that pretty much always helps.  You don't have to do this alone.  I wouldn't have made it to where I am today if I'd kept trying to do it alone.  You don't need to be ashamed of the fact that you're 30.  I'm 28, and know some people who started this process after turning 40 (LONG after in some cases).  The only things that are guaranteed to never work are 1) giving up and 2) refusing to learn from mistakes.  I had a hard time at first, but I never gave up and pretty regularly decided to learn from my mistakes.  It was rough, and I got awfully close to giving up for good at one point, but I came back and kept asking for help.

But a simple thing, every time that self-defeating nature arises, stop and focus on the source of it. Really focus, explore it deeply. It took me weeks of constant attention, but after a while I was able to curb all negative self-talk. I was able to provide myself with positive reinforcement right in the moment that I most needed it. I was amazed. I had been feeling worthless for longer than I could remember. The mind is a wondrously powerful thing. Negativity still exists for me, but that awareness has had a more lasting effect and things haven't gotten nearly as bad as they once were."

I already knew that games were an issue for me though, so I started talking about it in therapy.  Eventually my therapist pointed me in the direction of a website that was being used by a 12-Step recovery group focused on gaming addiction.  I checked the website out soon after, and almost immediately began reading forum posts and going to the online meetings.  Different people experience things in different ways, but I've found both therapy and 12-Step recovery to be extremely valuable in my journey from drooling game-playing zombie to more-or-less functional human being.  I find therapy to be helpful for dealing with a number of the underlying issues that contributed to my gaming, my recovery program (and the associated fellowship) to be helpful for staying away from playing a game today, and both to be helpful for dealing with daily life issues (stress, anxiety, painful experiences, etc.) and the ways they can push me back toward gaming.  The most spectacular changes have come from my working a 12-Step recovery program (like the one you can find here), particularly the work that I've done on the steps with my sponsor.  Not everybody needs that kind of a program, and I won't lie and say that it's easy, but I found it to be much easier than the regular relapsing I was doing on my own.

But just like anything you do in excess, your passion wanes and your skills fall away with it until the whole process seems like it has just wasted your life away.   I remember one point a few years ago when I had worked my way through raiding in WoW with a casual social guild, which had been a lot of fun. But for years (I played wow off and on and hadn't had the time before) I'd been focussed on getting into a real raiding guild and playing the game with much 'better' players. I finally got into an awesome 10-player raid team and did a couple of runs in Ulduar. The difference in playing style, communication, and atmosphere was night and day - the game had suddenly become a second job, and would run late into the night, with serious dedication required. It was a short, sharp hit of reality and I immediately quit the guild, the game, and signed up at the gym. I didn't quit gaming back then but I made huge progress physically and socially by sticking to one new habit - going to the gym 5 days a week. It wasn't (and isn't) my physical age that allowed me to do it, it was more about what I believed I should be able to do.   Since then some crappy stuff happened and I fell back into games and this time I decided to go cold turkey 70 days ago. I've succeeded with that and to be honest I have no desire to play games any more, I thought it would be more difficult but I think at our age it is a little easier to put things into perspective and stay on target. However, starting to develop good habits again has been a whole lot harder and I think it's the mentality of being 30 and thinking, as you do, that the best years have passed, and somehow now I'm a has-been and there's no point trying when there's no-one there to appreciate it. But when you think about it, in modern society that makes very little sense - there are no real reasons to marry/have kids/get a house/settle down early, people are living longer and healthier lives (if they work at it), and there are far more opportunities available to us now in the globalised world to renew ourselves and give it another shot - at 30, 40, 50... The only difference is how your mind ages and you mature, and because of the company you keep you feel that you're subject to their norms.   It is difficult though, so if you're interested in having someone to keep you accountable and vice versa, let me know as it's quite easy to let things slip when no-one is there to remind you."

I stopped at ilvl 645.  I started the game late and realized there will be no end goal for me because updates continually push the item cap level higher and higher.  WoW hasn't been fruitful with its rewards for me, and I'm realizing the same for the other games I play.  I'm impressed that you dropped it (even for a short time) and churned out a productive activity right then and there... the discipline to maintain it and the will to start it in the first place.  It's definitely something I strive to attain for myself.  How has it been since you've gone cold turkey as far as dealing with idle time, if any?  I agree developing good habits again will be much harder since I have been struggling with that through this transition.  The biggest obstacle I foresee though is maintenance so as not to fall back into old habits.  It's almost as if I feel liberated and yet I'm being selective about what my first action in my newly gained freedom will be.  I started reading several books but not consistently and have been going back and forth between them.  I do realize again that I'm not short of years, and the world has something out there for me.  I just have to be proactive about it.  Thanks for putting that into perspective."

I wouldn't recommend that, it just worked for me at the time ;D  Now it's much harder - I'm pretty good at abstaining and have felt a great deal of stress lift from my shoulders, giving me a lot more time to spend with friends and start enjoying life. In terms of productivity though, not much has changed so far as my brain is wired for constant novelty/fun/pleasure, so generally I have replaced all the problematic pastimes with another one - web surfing. It's not something that will stop me socialising but it is something that stops my productivity. I'm fairly certain that this issue is going to involve some brute-force willpower, and some way of holding myself accountable."

StopGaming,3c9hk4,Varioque,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"I just started posting on this forum today, so I am by no means experienced in quitting games (4 days strong I think), but if I am to give my pennies, I would actually suggest that you think over the whole ""computer-quitting"" aspect a whole lot more than the ""game-quitting"" aspect. If you are into coding, I presume that you are already aware or have at least felt the vertigo one does when one realizes the vastness of the internet. While quitting senseless activities is a good idea, do remember that the internet is a tool. It is very hard to manage properly, but if you do, it is immensely rewarding in its knowledge depth and ease of accessibility to what information you are searching for, be it coding instructions, tips, etc (I am a CS student). Especially forums discussing books, downloading audio books for plane/train rides (seeing as you, as I myself do, enjoy reading). You can get sheet music online for any song you feel like learning (piano player myself)... The possibilities are endless, so if you are thinking about banning computer activity, you would do well to consider the ramifications. Even so, I understand where your urge stems from, and I am currently involved in a process that will simply cut -gaming- from my life without cutting the ""good"" parts I learnt from it (browsing, chatting, verbal social skills, etc). I realize that cutting the computer might seem simple, but I personally wouldn't do it, and I advise you to consider the possibility of permitting a lifestyle that allows a computer but not gaming. If you feel as if this is too hard, try a clean cut, at least initially.  But lastly, I want to point out that I am a 25-year old CS-student (beginning my last year this autumn), father of none. I have three siblings who I care immensely about (my tenth year to the 13th were largely sibling management and nothing else besides school), but my gut tells me that care and management of my children would be of utmost priority. This does not mean that I would dedicate all my time to them, but that my time with them would be prioritized higher. I also feel (possibly naively, having no children), that while you should -prioritize- your child(ren), that is no reason to forget yourself, your personality, nor your interests that constitute it.  With all of this drunk rambling, I hope I got something of value said. If not, I hope that, as I often feel, that reading about someone else's similar experience has proven to be an eye-opener, if not, then an eye-twitcher at least. :3"
StopGaming,3c9hk4,camerondare,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:30:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, I appreciate it.  I know what you mean about the internet, it is a great source of free material which can (with dedication) allow me to master anything. I've spent many hours reading wikis/reddit/forums when researching things, and I felt it was worthwhile time.   I've actually installed StayFocusd extension to limit my time on mindless browsing, and it's working well. I get 10 minutes of reddit and that's enough to get through 4 pages of frontpage, look at a few articles and threads. Then it stops me and I makes me get on with whatever I should be doing.  Whenever I'm away from home I have no problem not playing games or just sitting on the computer all evening, and I think part of the problem is that it's just a habit I've formed over the years. I go to work, I do all my household duties, then come 8pm I can sit down at the computer with a nice cup of tea. That feeling of chores done and now it's my time that I've been waiting for is so good, it's hard to give it up. Even when later I feel bad for doing it.  I've thought of so many things I want to type up but it's getting late and I want to break away from the computer tonight.  Good luck with your game quitting too."

When you're dealing with urges you want to follow this. The thing is, you get urges from triggers that happen. So watching game videos for example will only make you want to play, so you want to design your life in a way that doesn't have these triggers.

Just do something, even if you feel like you don't like it, and once you start getting better at it you'll probably start liking it more and more and life will get better and better. You just gotta trust in the proces. And if you end up not liking it you just try out something else. There are loads of things to do on this planet.

StopGaming,3c50ep,Yxven,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:18:48 2015 UTC,"Please forgive this really long post, it got a bit out of hand but there are so many things that helped me. There is a tl;dr at the end.  I never got out of it, depression still gets me from time to time and really really badly too. Depression always seems to get me when I don’t exercise and when I don’t eat healthy, but it can be really hard to do those things when depressed. I’ve had days on which I’ve been paralyzed in bed, not even feeling the will to make some food.  What always helps me is acknowledging that its just my brain chemistry thats fucked up and that these thoughts I have are just the result of that brain chemistry and thus it's just a depressive perspective but not the absolute truth, if you will. I know this because I notice that when I don't feel depressed I can look at the same problems and I'll take on a whole different, more positive view.   So if brain chemistry is the problem, then the solution would surely be to change it. How can you change it? Excercise and eating healthy. Even though it can be super hard I just try to distance myself from the negativity and the lethargy and I just push myself to do it. I don't set high standards for myself when doing this. I get the ball rolling by rewarding myself for small goals such as just getting outside. Then I push myself to do more and more. Daily meditation also really helps with distancing myself from my thoughts and emotions.   For diet I can recommend the book ""The Ultramind Solution"". I basically try to only drink water and I avoid sugar, wheats and fatty foods. I also take vitamin D every day except in the summer.   What also seems to help me is just hanging out with people. Just talking to someone on the phone makes me feel better. Just having positive social contact is good. Having good positive friends is even better. Finding the right friends can be really really hard though. You’ve gotta watch out for some people too. Hanging out with the wrong people can really amplify depression. I personally felt held back and annoyed by my parents. Just distancing myself from them for a while really helped me. I stopped visiting them for a while and then I confronted them with what annoyed me about them and things slowly got better. I also forced myself to be social by forcing myself to attend a lot of parties. At first this was really depressing because my social skills were bad, but I read a lot of books about social skills and I slowly got better and right now I almost always feel great when I talk to someone.  What also helps me is getting positive feedback from winning at things. For instance, I feel really good after I've made a couple of goals when playing soccer. Not only is this excercise, but it also reïnforces that I am of worth as a person. Not only for myself but for the team. And I also get to hang out with other people when playing soccer.   Lastly I wanna say this. Just taking action at something real (not video games) always seems to help me immediately. It just puts my mind onto something else. To me, the true cure to depression is action. Just do something. Anything. Take action and you'll start feeling better. Passively sitting around is your biggest enemy. I discovered this with studying. I never wanted to study but at one point I got forced to do it every day for hours and strangely I felt really good about it afterwards. Even though I was in a really shitty situation (I probably had to quit college), I felt really really good about the hard work I did. I felt more confident and at night I could relax really well. That showed me that just taking the right actions can be very powerful against depression. Right now I try to do the same thing with exercise (running and weightlifting), since I’d love to get ripped.  I never actually wanted to commit suicide, but I’ve had times when I’ve been thinking about it a lot and I can tell you that staying alive is always worth it for the good moments in life (and those moments will always inevitably come). Work on changing your perspective. Work on yourself, and that work will be rewarded.   Feel free to ask me any questions or to share your own opinion about these things.   Tl;dr: Detach yourself from the negativity. Force yourself to take action. Excercise. Eat healthy.  Edit: I forgot to add one thing: Sleep. Getting enough sleep in a regular pattern is super important."

The thing is, gaming has always been your go-to and it fulfills a lot of different areas in your life, and it's always been your crutch. So continuing to game (ween yourself off) will just continue to give you the outlet that you use to mask the situation you're in, whatever that looks like.  The benefit of going cold turkey is that it forces you into a position where you get to learn what you need to learn to move on from games, which, at least after 90 days will give you a much better perspective to consider whether you want any games in your life or not.  Urges are normal and you'll need to find ways to deal with them. This video will help a lot.  Hope this helps. Let me know if I can help in any other way. :)"

Anyways, what I've heard from authority figures is that an abnormal neural network forms in behavioral addicts. From what I've been told by a substance abuse therapist: in behavioral addicts, certain behaviors ""hijack"" areas of the brain that are normally only functioning during sex for normally functioning people; (I'm pretty sure a number of others here have corroborated that account).  A guy who is part of the community and also a medical doctor (not verified) was saying something about that there is some sort of chemical present in synapses (?) of the brain of addicts called,""Delta Fos B"". It acts as a sort of catalyst for the absorption of dopamine.   I think he was saying that Delta Fos B has a relatively long half life so it takes a (relatively) long time to exit the neural system. Apparently, if the addict stops intake of an addictive substance or seizes an addictive behavior Delta Fos B eventually seizes to exist in the brain.  I think findings on Delta Fos B have had some part in the 90 day abstinence period. A more precise term in place of detox would be ""90 day purge"" if detox rubs you the wrong way."

StopGaming,3c24gj,ozky123,2,Sun Jul 5 14:38:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with cold turkey.

If you can't moderate, though, there isn't really any other way to stop."
StopGaming,3c24gj,noflyinginthehouse,2,Sat Jul 4 04:50:46 2015 UTC,"Hell I tried moderating for a long time; if attempting moderation gets the ball rolling I consider it progress. For a lot of people cold turkey appears to be too much too quick. I think for most people who've gone through addictive bouts the thing that works most effectively is cold turkey; but if you gotta rule out moderation first that's progress.  I talked to a substance abuse therapist about behavioral addictions and she suggested if I were to try moderation first try 90 days to reset the internal workings (apparently there were some studies that supported this system). That was enough for me; but it was given even more credence when I saw that Cam suggested the 90 day abstinence period as well.  Once I got to 90 days I said, ""fuck it; might as well keep on going it's not worth fucking around anymore"". You may be a functional addict so experimenting with moderation may be a luxury you can afford; I was quickly spiraling into a non-functioning addict so it wasn't worth the risk. Thus I continued abstinence after day 90.  Good luck with that."

The best way to beat the urges is to start restructuring your life, finding a replacement for gaming - that is meaningful to you.

It was somewhat difficult to not just cave in and watch (or play games for that matter) but after a couple weeks pass I just genuinely stopped caring to even watch.

Yes, sometimes I need to think about things, but sometimes I need to focus only on the little chunk of life that's right in front of me and trust that everything else will work out so long as I keep taking care of my little chunk.

The major benefit you learn from going through this journey is that in life there are ups and downs too and it's all about how you adapt to them. With games we were able to numb and avoid having to face things in our life, but now by quitting although it's scary because we are opened up to have to face these things head on, the gift from that is that we develop a new ability to face adversity and push forward.  In times like this is important to go back to the foundation you've been building to refocus on what's most important.

In the last few years I haven't lived in the same spot for more than 2-3 months, and for all of 2013 I was in a new city every week for the entire year. So this hurt my ability to feel grounded, but the lesson I learned was to find grounding in something else.  For me, that was coffee shops. Regardless of the city or country I'm in, I can find a coffee shop to go sit in, have a cup of coffee and chill for a bit and let myself get grounded. Now, I know you're trying to save money and that's cool, so maybe you can find a library or something that can be more of a consistent experience in your life.  That's what I would do. It's great that your girlfriend is a major support, and when you get back from Cali it's time to put a plan of action into place for you to get your own spot ASAP.

I turned to playing videogames more after this happened about 6-8 months ago. Before that I played a decent amount, but I still had other things.

It's the best damn job for a person my age. All you have to be is 18 and have no criminal record.  Don't give up hope. Gaming is just a attempted drug to fix underlying issues. They are not the cause. Fix the causes and remove yourself from the actions (gaming) that cause you not to work on those issues.

No one would care of course, because I'm just another voice on the Internet and I would have played the game way after it was released (because I was a savings and patient gamer; since I've started playing videogames at the age of 3/4, actually). My inclination towards the technical side of things has to do with having studied and still studying (and working on top of that) in IT.  As for working in the industry, I live in a country where no one cares about gaming and I never knew anyone who had the same passion and an open-mind to several types of game as I did (sounded elitist there), nor to have a deep discussion about them. My parents never supported gaming, the rest of my family only cousins liked it briefly, but some grew out of that and others just play online games, which nowadays I absolutely detest and don't have the same energy and motivation to play them (and meet new people), as I had in the past.  Due to these circumstances, my dreams of making a game independently, working in a videogame company or working in the 'critic' side (what is a reputable critic of this medium anyway?; what is the best way to evaluate a game? do these ""videogame critics"" even understand anything about videogame development (which is essentially software development?)) are dead in the water.  Since 9th grade (way before the digital distribution revolution and back when retail was the ""only way"" (viable) to go), I researched and came to the conclusion that this industry was just to hard for me and I would mix my passion and would frequently have creative conflicts. Now I see kids using assets bought in the Unity store and making half-assed games and releasing them as alpha, and suprisingly people pay money for them. Now is the time to get on the bandwagon and make a decent game, because it is more accessible and the tools are easier to use (it doesn't mean that making a game is going to be easy, it still is incredibly hard, it's just more accessible when compared with the state the industry was in, when I had a desire to make games). But I'm just conflicted because I also procrastinated a lot with videogames (not just videogames: TV, movies, etc) and I want to cut procrastination altogether, and videogames are a part of that.  That's why it's really hard for me to put them aside (more the connection with the medium, less with the act of playing games). They have been a part of 85% of my life until now."

I do hope those out there who find themselves repeatedly relapsing and ""other activities"" not helping find the real help they need. It can be demoralizing to keep reading these sorts of posts and watching youtube videos with simplistic advice on how they should be able to change. It isn't that simple for some people and to those out there, I feel for you and can understand.

StopGaming,3brtis,noflyinginthehouse,4,Wed Jul 1 17:09:22 2015 UTC,"I think it is awesome that you are seeking out help for your son.  I'm not sure how helpful my advice will be, but this is just from my perspective with my relationship with my parents.  My mom and dad care a lot about me, and know that I have been severely unhappy for many years and that gaming is an issue of mine, as well as depression and a laundry list of other things.  They key thing is, though, that gaming isn't the issue.  It is my coping mechanism/way for me to escape the shit that I don't want to deal with, and it gave me a sense of purpose in a life where I still have no idea what I want to accomplish.  The thing I wish I had from my parents was support, but not to the point of being overbearing.  Oftentimes we view our parents as these stoic figures who couldn't possibly understand the shit we are going through, and it tough for us to see parents as anything but these authority figures, and not fellow humans.  If you open up to your son about your worries about him, and just let him know that you are there anytime he wants to talk about anything that would be awesome.  The problem my parents have is that they ask me a million questions.  There are very few times I feel like talking to them, and if I do, it is only when I am in the mood and initiate it.  If they pester me with questions i don't want to open up to them.  So I guess be open and loving, but let him approach you.  Maybe share some of your doubts you had about life when you were his age or figure out some way to relate to his struggle.  That might be a gateway for him to eventually open up to you about what is really going on with him.  Maybe he feels lost, or overwhelmed, or worthless, or whatever it may be.  Whatever his reason is for turning to gaming, he is using it as a crutch so he doesn't have to approach these emotions.  Don't be judgmental about him gaming though.  That will only lead to resentment and a desire to play more.  Recognize that he needs gaming right now, and that that is okay for where he is in life right now.  Encourage him to think about what is truly bothering him though, and if you can offer any wisdom/insight into what he is dealing with from your own personal experiences that would be really helpful.  Unfortunately there is no perfect way to approach this though, and ultimately it is up to him to decide that he wants to quit hiding behind gaming and start living life to the fullest.  There is only so much you can do as his parents.  Don't forget about the option if a therapist too.  Sometimes the most comfortable way for us to open up is to do so in the presence or a caring stranger who has been trained to know what to say.  It helps for me somewhat.  TL;DR: My advice: Be open, honest and loving; Don't push him; Don't criminalize his gaming; Have patience, and recognize that he is struggling right now.  Good luck! :)"

Many games also incorporate addictive components similar to gambling. The neurochemical addiction is not too difficult to abate after abstaining from games. The psychological component, on the other hand, is a lot trickier. Once you have experienced the relative ease of fulfilling the aforementioned human emotions with video games, it is much more difficult to give them up for a shot at the real world where they can be much harder to obtain."

My parents could do whatever they want and I wouldn't listen to them. They could block my internet, block my computer or do whatever they wanted to do and it would just make everything worse. Honestly, I do believe that there is no real ""cure"" unless the affected person admits their problems and actively wants to change.  I have never heard of an addict that he recovered by getting forced to do so.  In other words: As sad as it sounds, you can't do much.   Gaming is a tool to relieve from stress, escaping problems and overall just a break from real life. Gaming is easy, social, it gives you a false sense of growing and it's has fast rewards.

My life situation is still way too complicated to explain. But let's say that I was about to get kicked out of my school after already getting a second chance there. Last year I completely ruined my image by missing around 90 days of school (maybe even more). The school already signed me out, but a miracle happened and I was allowed to stay under special conditions. And this year it started pretty good, but I eventually I skipped school days again.. luckily this time I could catch myself literally in the last second.  I also had barely any friends and I never went out to do something. Gaming was the only thing that I did 24/7.  I think the hard part for me was to realize, that the only thing I had when I was at the bottom of my life was gaming, which ironically WAS the reason why I was on the bottom.   Imagine someone who only has 1 activity in life that keeps him alive... and he needs to quit it in order to get a better life. (But he doesn't know at this point)  How the hell do you want to tell this guy ""Hey, stop doing what you did your whole life!"" ?  I wish there was an easier answer and right now I regret every single hour spent on games. I had no teenage life.  edit: I probably found one of the best comparisons to help a normal person understand what it's like to be an addict:  Imagine a scenario where someone told you to stop breathing in order to gain special powers. You would think, that this guy is stupid and you would ignore his ""advice"". Anyway, one time you decide to try it out and you hold your breath. After 2 minutes you can't hold it any longer because there is a huge urge to breath. Sooner or later you will breath again, because your body/mind and breathing reflex is stronger. You can't stop."

We all hit speed bumps along the way but getting to 27 days so far is a huge accomplishment to be proud of!   With your schedule it's important to remember that your schedule is something relative to you. We all have the same days each week, but our commitments and different ways our time is filled will be different. It's not about having something consistent all the time, it's about knowing you have Monday-Sunday and being aware of the time you have each day. It will change but that's the reason why having a schedule is so important.  The way I do it is I have a day each week where I know I'll be able to look at my calendar for the week ahead. Usually Sunday nights can be good for this but you can pick your own day. Use this to look ahead at your week and understand what it looks like. Then, each day/night, I also look at what tomorrow brings, any commitments I have and any free time I have that I want to be aware of (to fill and/or to do something specific for.)  When we quit gaming we can go through a period of lethargy, so that could be what you're going through and that's fine. If it's not that, it can be just not knowing what you're going to spend your time on when you do get home, so just being more aware of that is key. Are you reading any books right now? That's a good one to add if not.  Remember, life changes a lot and it's all about how you adapt to it. Your schedule is a good way to practice your ability to adapt when things change. :)  Hope that helps.

Congrats on 50 days, even though you relapsed that is still an incredible accomplishment you should feel proud of.  Relapse doesn't have to be a bad thing if you learn from it and implement those learnings moving forward. From your post there's a lot you can learn from, including that you need to be aware of when your brain is coming up with all sorts of justifications to play.  During the 90 day detox period you're most likely to find other activities to be boring in comparison to gaming. This happens for a reason. I would highly recommend you focus on meditating each day, at least for 10 minutes, to help you improve your mindfulness (which will help you when your brain is trying to encourage you to play.) Here's the science behind it.  If you want instant gratification, start working out. After working out for 30 minutes or an hour you'll have that energy shift experience you're looking for. It's not a perfect fix but it can be part of the solution, combined with working on your coding and other hobbies. Chasing instant gratification is a fine line, and in many cases is a pathway that leads us nowhere near fulfillment in life. Being able to separate from this is important. Read Mastery by George Leonard.  Hope that helps. I relapsed once for 5 months (I played 16 hours a day) before I recommitted and haven't touched one since. Use your relapse as feedback and refocus on why you're moving on from games. Why is it important to you? What are your goals and vision for yourself and your future? This is all crucial to know why you're doing what you're doing."

It helped me a ton, gave me much more energy to go outside and not get stuck watching Stargate or whatever."

I'm not sure if it's because of the sunk cost fallacy your video was about, but it's usually depression kicking me in the but wanting me to quit games.   Then fast forward a month or two after quitting, and I'm feeling pretty happy because I've actually used my time improving myself instead of gaming. However, it's remarkable how we tend to tell ourselves when everything is okay ""playing a little won't hurt"", even when we really know it will lead us down that old path again. A month later I've been playing and slowly started neglecting what made me kick the depression in the first place, so of course it slowly creeps back.   Haha, just writing this down helps me, because I'm gaining some perspective, so hopefully I won't repeat that incredibly dump 'loop' again.   Also, I use to tell myself that I can manage moderation with gaming, but it always starts with moderation, but ends up as an addiction. I think I probably have to go cold turkey and never look back, what do you think? Anyway, if you have some tips or even just are reading this, thanks.

It's such a common phenomenon that the mental health world has a special term to refer this...it's called ""euphoric recall"".  I counteract it by doing things like deliberately stopping to remember just how miserable I was, going to my 12-Step recovery meetings, spending time talking to other addicts about both addiction in particular and life in general, and reading things like this that remind me all over again why I wanted to stop.

The ""toxicity"" of League of Legends and online games in general got to me too. In one experience my entire team in CS:GO ragged me out for the duration of a competitive game because I was not performing at the level that they expected.  I don't know why people think that negative words benefit anyone, even themselves? Instead of giving me tips, or helping me to perform better with them, they chose negative words.

The realizations you've had as a result of this all sound really good.  Recognizing that the games aren't actually what you want is really good, seeing two practical things you can change to help yourself out is also good, and seeing something that you want to have change way down deep inside of yourself is also excellent.  I don't know if you've considered this idea yet, but a 12-Step recovery group for gaming addicts (like CGAA) might be helpful.  It'd give you things to do, a chance to socialize in an environment where people actually get what it means to be a gaming addict, and yet another source of help to draw on the next time you find yourself wanting to go back to games.

I don't know if the age to buy alcohol is 18 or 21 where you live, but seriously, they don't call alcohol a social lubricant for nothing. Also, if you're thinking about going off to university / college, you can use that as a fresh slate - it's exactly what I did - nobody has to know you were once a gaming addict and for all they know, you've never picked up a controller/keyboard and mouse.  In terms of a hobby which isn't repetitive, I'd perhaps recommend starting a martial art (although every martial art is repetitive to some degree)? I started jiu jitsu a while after I quit gaming and, although working out / school work had already filled the hole gaming had left behind, jiu jitsu certainly helped, and I knew the skills I was (and still am) developing weren't just levelling me up in a game, in some minute sphere of life, but rather that some sort of self defense and fitness was levelling me up in every sphere of life, for the rest of my life, be it with regard to confidence or genuinely knowing how to fight if the worst came to the worst."

When it comes to the gym, it's important to notice that the gym is only repetitive if you're repetitive. There is literally so much you can learn about the gym, not just the gym itself (and exercises) but also health, fitness, nutrition, etc. There are about a thousand different ways you can exercise, you can dive into personal training, yoga teacher training, crossfit, outdoor adventure races, gymnastics, parkour, etc.  A few good books to read are: The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson, Daring Greatly by Brené Brown, The Power of Habit by Charlie Duhigg and How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.

Reconnecting with nature is a great way to shift your energy, so try and have something where you can do that every day, ideally in the morning to start your day strong.  The realization you had the other day is about compound interest. If you read the book The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson (one of my favorite books!), you'll learn more about that and how you can apply it to anything you want. It's one of the best personal development/success secrets out there. It's all about baby steps, consistently every day.  Remember with meditation to follow the guides. The point isn't to not have anything in your mind (that's ideal but not reality), when meditation is much more an active practice of having things less than ideal and having to learn how to adapt to it and remain focused. That's why the research behind it is so amazing. Definitely keep at it.  Dreams of gaming is normal. It's like after you go through a breakup you'll dream about your ex.

StopGaming,3bgrc1,Scriptopeia,2,Mon Jun 29 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that the MMORPG golden age has now passed. WoW used to be the most popular game in the world, and at its subscriber peak was orders of magnitude larger than the playerbase of LoL/DoTA, but this has flipped on its head with declining userbase for WoW, particularly amongst the hardcore PvE players. The game has been made more accessible and classes more homogeneous for clarity, but this decreased the ""difficulty"" of the game and many of the long term players felt that it cheapened their experience. League has been legitimised by its burgeoning userbase and huge professional scene, and in terms of monthly hours played is the biggest game in the world.  Gaming addicts are generally addicted to being the ""best"" at their particular game, and whilst that used to mean more in WoW when it was more popular, and ""harder"", it is now more relevant to be good at the new biggest game, LoL, and MOBAs in general.   All of this is just conjecture and I don't have any decent sources, just personal experience; myself and friends of mine all used to be heavily into WoW. Most of us quit as it began to decline, which was the first time I quit gaming for a serious amount of time. When League came around most of the same group of gamers took it up again, me included, and have been playing it ever since, although I managed to finally quit myself a few weeks ago. Never again!!  So for me personally I was actually addicted to both genres, I just got out of MMO's a while back.

There was too much aggression and rage for me to deal with.  I guess for me, who enjoys the coop side of MMOs (raiding, dungeons, etc), there was an extreme form of community that I formed.  It made it that much harder for me to let go because I genuinely cared about the people I played with, and there was a focus on bettering the whole group rather than individuals so that we could complete a raid.  This was different that what I experienced in the MOBA world where it felt like any slip up was a cause for anger and rejection.  I'm sure that the whole MOBA community isn't like that, but from a lot of what I have read from people coming from that community, they realized that they hated being miserable and angry at the game all the time.  I rarely felt this in MMOs, so maybe that is a factor?  Honestly I don't know, this is just an idea.  It is a lot harder to leave a friendly community than a shitty one lol.

Do this for two reasons: 1) To give your brain the full detox 2) To do it for yourself so you can really learn more about how gaming plays in your life.  Remember, this isn't so much about gaming as it is about your relationship to it and how it interacts in your life. To move on from games it's easy to focus on games when really it's about you taking a step to start creating the life you want, and that's one where you may need to move on from games... at least for a period (90 days minimum) to give yourself a real chance to experience something new.

Online poker smells like on online game to me, so I would expect that for me, as a gaming addict, that I would pretty quickly lose my ability to control my behavior.  Given how much I dislike what I start doing when I relapse and experience the resulting loss of control, I (personally) wouldn't care to even experiment with online poker at this point.

The goal of game developers is to create a challenge to reward ratio that nothing in the real world can compare to - keeping you coming back for more. It took me until this month for me to really start laughing out loud and enjoying things outside of gaming. For addicts like us, gaming overflows our reward centers to the point that we build a tolerance (the brain shuts down dopamine receptors due to the overflow of it when we game), causing anything less stimulating than gaming to seize in rewarding us at all (except for sex, which is probably why alot of gamers also tend to have porn issues as well).

StopGaming,3bfpk2,ozky123,2,Mon Jun 29 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"Have you ever successfully moderated your gaming in the past? Do you have any evidence, in your experience, that you would have sufficient self-control to stick to the limits you set for yourself? Being honest with yourself, and realistic about your capacity for change, is the simplest way to approach thoughts of relapse.  You know what would happen... even if you were able to stick to the limits you set, you would constantly be thinking about gaming outside of that time. You would look forward to every session, and feel crappy whenever you had to log off. You would start to question why you set these limits in the first place, when they didn't make you feel any better about gaming.  Professional help isn't a bad idea, but it's expensive. Many, many people have gone from severely addicted to completely free from games without therapy or medication. And on a personal note, I went to a therapist for a few years when I was in my late teens. I always felt better after talking to him, but my behavior didn't change significantly. I realized later that I treated the therapist like an external solution that would ""fix"" me, so I didn't have to do the work myself."

You tell yourself ""I get rank X and then I will only play 1 game to not decay""   Even though I spent far more time than you and I reached my goal (Challenger), I was still not satisfied. I explained my problem, how I always wanted more, in another post. Telling myself that I could stop after X rank was literally a lie.  Riot figured it out. The ultimate addiction system. No one cares about the rank outside of the game and in order to gain better ranks you need to sacrifise your life to League of Legends. It's really better to completely stop.  Many people in this sub already know my opinion about moderated gaming. Trying to moderate the addiction is literally the worst mistake an addict can make. (If he doesn't learn from it!)  Otherwise, if you really want to get rid of League, you can write the Riot support an email to freeze your account.  --> Riot Support <--  edit: Also, don't fall into the Sunk Cost Fallacy trap.

I used to play Hearthstone a lot, but I was never that good (my best rank was like 14, top being 1). I told myself to quit several times, but my argument against quitting each time was: ""think about the hours I spent on the game getting better, and think about the legendary cards I've collected, I don't want to abandon them all!"" But I eventually did succeed in quitting, because REMEMBER: Don't be fooled into thinking that your progress in games has real value, and don't be trapped by your past progress. They don't mean anything outside that community. I bet 95% of the world's population don't know what LOL is, or what WOW is, hence they are of no significance to them. One last advice that has helped me a lot: Make quitting game the end, not the means. Quit game for the sake of quitting. Oftentimes, we can't find a good purpose to quitting, so we are reluctant. You don't need a purpose (if you can't find one). Quit for its own sake, and your life purpose will eventually, and definitely find you."

When I first quit I had anxiety problems, depression and had basically no social skills or friends. It was bad!  Quitting was the best decision I ever made and my life has improved immensely since then. But I decided to quit because I was tired of living a life I wasn't proud of. I was tired of only feeling good about myself because I was good at a game instead of proud of how I show up outside of games. I was tired of being depressed and anxious about my life so I committed to changing that situation, regardless of where I was starting or how much work it would take to get there.  We all make that decision differently and we all have to make it for ourselves. Just remember, you play games for specific reasons and one of those is that it makes you feel more accomplished and it's where you hang out with your friends. So to move on from games you need to find new ways of feeling good about yourself and you need to find new ways to interact with your friends.  If you want to quit, you can follow the advice in this thread.  One other thing I'd love to show you is that even though gaming is what you're good at, there are specific ways you've got good at games that you can use to get good at anything else you want. Watch this video to learn more about that.  WE're here for you if you have any other questions. Just let us know! :)"

I suddenly wanted to fix everything that was wrong in my life, and try to make up for lost time by doing waaaay too many things at once. I still had the fundamental problem that I wasn't satisfied with who I was or where I was in life.  Just like you said, that's when the insidious little voice starts to creep into your head and make you think that gaming would be a great solution to your problems.  ""I'm doing everything I'm supposed to in real life, but it's not making me happy. I know if I play a game I will feel instantly satisfied, so why not reward myself?""  I'm starting to really concede that happiness isn't something I can squeeze out of life if I just work hard enough. It has to be cultivated from within, through the daily practice of acceptance. Accepting that who you are right now is exactly who you're supposed to be right now, without judgment. It took me many months to even comprehend what that meant, but by staying on this path one day at a time I know I'll always be moving toward that ideal."

You can definitely become happier with hard work as there are a lot of things you want that need it. I think it's about accepting who you are while striving for more. Merely accepting things as they are and not doing anything to change and improve is a lot like sitting there playing video games all day. On the other hand, one can't fall into the trap that you and I have where we're expecting happiness as a goal after all the hard work. It means that you're never happy while on the journey but forgetting that life is the journey itself. You never really reach some plateau where everything is exactly as you want it to be and you can bask in the warm glow of happiness. You're always striving to get a little better, move ahead a little more, and so on. I'm taking active steps to enjoy the ride and savour the victories as they come, big or small.

So many people would kick a bad habit, get a big rush from ""finally conquering their demon"", and then go on to wreck every aspect of their lives by overdoing, well, everything.  Soon after quitting they'd do drastic things like leave their loved ones to start their life anew, drop out of school, quit their jobs, etc.  They'd be all fired up for a couple months, get burnt out, and go back to their addiction--alone.

I've been hit by a car, shot at, lost a parent, lost my job, lost my girlfriend, have had a depression, have been almost literally dropped into a black pit. And I HAVE BEEN addicted to painkillers and GAMING.   But I'm still here, still hanging in there, still having a positive outlook and the only one I can truly thank for that is myself.    First of all, you have to change your habits. Having quit gaming isn't necessarily enough. You need to fundamentally change your old habits. And it will take time.   You've been in the loop for far too long for it not to take some time and adjustment. Look at it as if you were trying to build up your body from scratch. How would you go about doing so?   You'll need food for the mind and food for the body.   Your gaming made you feel good about yourself because you felt somewhat accomplished because it released chemicals in your brain telling you that you did good.   You probably also had friends online or at least played with other people which means that it gave you a social benefit, over say book reading.    Find something that gives your mind the same nurturing. Something that tells your mind an body that what you're doing right now - away from your computer and especially away from gaming - is good and better.   Secondly; you can do whatever you like.  Remember that.  Seeing as you're probably a regular guy who's kind of average all round, you probably haven't realised this yet but the biggest adventure game of all time is right outside your front door.   You might live in a boring neighbourhood in a boring small town or in the midst of a Manhattan-like metropolis, but it really doesn't matter. There's tons of stuff to do.   You shouldn't think of it as ""being bored"" think of it as free time. What do you want to do with your free time? What skills have you always wanted to learn? Cooking? Skating? Language skills? Speed-seduction?   What sports have you always wanted to try out? Here's a list of sports you could try. I fucking guarantee you that there's someone doing one of those sports near you, right now.   Instead of spending maybe 5-10 hours á day in a fictional universe with rules set up by developers and money-chugging companies you now have an open world with 7,324,876,800 players as of right now.  If you're bored my man, get away from your computer, away from your desk, up out of your room and the fuck out there and do something different.   You know how I got this perspective on things?   I jumped out of a fucking plane at 13000 feet. That'll show you that life is only boring if YOU make it so. The problem is in your head and you need to figure out how to rewire yourself.   Be it meditation and mindfulness or be it something completely different, you simply have to stop telling yourself that you're bored because there's nothing to do. It's a petitio principii, a fallacy.   You keep thinking you're bored because you're telling yourself that there's nothing to do, yet there is lots of stuff to do but you're just too focused on being bored to actually do something different for a change; and thus you end up confirming yourself in the notion that there's nothing for you to do which again leads you to (tadaaaaaaa) FEEL BORED.  What you're experiencing when you're just about to relapse is a psychological phenomenon called Extinction Bursts, and you need to know and acknowledge that if you relapse, you'll have a much harder time quitting next time.   You are addicted, and you need to treat it like an addiction otherwise your mind and body will never be free from it.   There's never nothing going on, and boredom is an insult to oneself.

So, I would disagree with the reckless advice by /u/Microwaves_Pets to go ahead and ""get some hours in"". (This is ""StopGaming"" after all, not sure why someone would think that's appropriate)  When I first quit I was bored with everything too. I couldn't commit to anything and I'd feel like I had a lack of motivation. Depression and laziness and boredom and all that bad stuff were a dark cloud in my life. What I eventually learned is that it is a very common feeling and reaction to abstaining from something I was addicted to.  My gaming was not the problem, it was the ""solution"" I sought for all the negative feelings and avoidance issues I had that I didn't want to or couldn't address. By removing them from my life with nothing to help me deal with all the other crap I was avoiding, being awake every day was just like gritting my teeth until I could fall asleep and potentially dream of something game-related as a relief. The only thing that has helped me to move away from that and actually make progress in my ""real life"" was getting involved with a group of addicts on a regular basis who were working an actual program of recovery. That meant attending meetings and focusing on something that could help me finally deal with what games helped me to avoid all my life. For some people, watching some motivational videos, reading some wisdom and posting once in a while on a forum just doesn't cut it. It certainly did not for me. I was a true addict to video games and I needed help.  I hope you find what can work for you instead of going back to something that will do nothing positive for you except eat up your time.

I had almost 4 months of depression after I first stopped 5 months ago (there've been some relapses along the way). I've gradually been coming out of it. It's not amazing at this point, but I'm definitely not as bored and lethargic now as I was, and I don't feel as hopeless. A few things I did were: I kept trying different ""fun"" activities (things that would be fun or engaging if only I could feel it), and I included a variety of different things that either had once been interesting or seemed like they might be (photography, meetups, music, research, social activities, crafts). I used the idea of action before motivation; when we're struggling, often the motivation to do things isn't there, but if we take action and just get started at whatever the activity is, then the motivation may follow eventually. I got support from other gaming addicts in not going back to gaming and working on recovery (CGAA meetings in my case); this helped a lot at times when I couldn't see the reasons why the fight was worth it, when the joint voices of addiction and depression were louder than anything else in my head.   I assume games were causing significant problems in your life if you stopped playing them, in which case going back to them is just going to make things worse than it already is. There's a saying that I've heard, that there's no problem that gaming can't make worse. It's hard but worth it to persevere."

StopGaming,3bcpty,AbsolutAlex,3,Sat Jun 27 23:46:36 2015 UTC,"Hey! Interesting thread. This is definitely something I have been thinking a lot about.  Phillip Zimbardo, a Stanford psychologist believes Porn and video game addiction leading to 'masculinity crisis'.  Although I agree with Phillip, what I'm not sure about is whether porn & gaming (let's focus on the gaming side for this sub) is leading to a masculinity crisis or whether a masculinity crisis is leading to porn and gaming.  My hypothesis is both, and that they are both contributing to each other and creating a vicious cycle.  The path to moving on from games, at least for men, has at least a degree of making a commitment to step into themselves. It comes down to a commitment to mature and become a man.  Now, when I say ""become a man"", I mean that along the lines of the traditional way you would ""become a man"" in tribal days was through a period of initiation.  In the modern era we no longer have that, so guys feel lost about what that really means. I believe one step - and this is certainly the case for myself - when I quit gaming I was going off on a journey where I was alone and having to find my way through my own independence, and in doing so, I could ""come back to the tribe"" as a man.  A bit of a ramble and I could say this smoother but hopefully you get the general idea."

Here's the science behind it.  It's also a big win for you to identify that who you became when you were gaming isn't who you want to be. Now it's about becoming more clear on who you DO want to be, what are the values you want to live by and how do you want to show up every day.

Sounds like it had a very big impact on your life, same as it did on mine.  On the contrary, it very important NOT to pretend about the reality of our gaming and its effects on us, very important to face the reality and accept it.  Whether or not to give up everything gaming-related depends on whether you're a gaming addict or a problem gamer.  A problem gamer can sometimes moderate, can often stop on their own with proper motivation, and can play certain types of games without trouble.  A problem gamer often feels better within days of cutting out the troublesome games.  An addict, on the other hand, feels completely out of sorts and lost when the gaming is stopped.  People like me consistently fail to moderate beyond a week or two, and usually in less time than that.  All of the strategies that I tried to stop on my own failed for me.  The only way to figure it out is to experiment... which is inevitable anyway.  There's not one problem gamer or gaming addict who is going to stop completely without playing around with other ideas first.  Another way to figure it out is to listen to the stories of gaming addicts, and also check out this self test and list of withdrawal symptoms, and see how much you relate to the experiences of gaming addicts.

It's important to remember that when you have new hobbies, it will take some time to start developing a passion for them in the same way. Passion doesn't happen automatically, it happens by putting more time in and through challenge.  When I quit I started learning how to DJ, and the learning curve was tough. In fact I almost quit because it was so hard. But I pushed through that and kept working at it, 30 mins here, 30 mins there, and then I started to get better and now I love it, couldn't imagine life without it.  So that takes time. The key is to keep trying new things and to put some time into them. If you compare yourself to Led Zeppelin of course you're going to be unmotivated. But you're not trying to be Led Zeppelin so that comparison isn't even accurate. ""Comparison is the thief of joy.""  What you want to do is start small and have some degree of structure to your learning so you have a reason to put more time in. What's one song you could start learning? Can you put 30 mins in each day? Over time that will turn into bigger rewards and as you get better you'll develop that positive feedback loop.  A few other thoughts:   Focus on having a project instead of a hobby. Projects give you more structure and help with a sense of purpose (which is key for motivation). Read The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson and Mastery by George Leonard. Both will be valuable to you.   Hope that helps. Keep working at it, it will come."

Back in the suck, the crazy mindhole from which I can't seem to escape. For what seems like a couple hours now, I've been obsessing about my life and the complete lack of meaning in it. Being a father seems mundane--anyone can raise kids, and it almost doesn't matter if I do a great job because my kid is going to be his own person anyways. The only useful, marketable skill that I actually possess (calibration and repair) is worth maybe a $50k salary, and is essentially a commodity function. I'm so fucking scatterbrained that I can't stick to one thing and see it through; I just want to jump from new shiny toy to new shiny toy without doing anything real in between.   And that was after I had quit games for over four months, and had quit drinking for over a year! (I'm also an alcoholic) That funk lasted a couple weeks, from what I can remember. I talked to people about it, continued to meditate and write every day, but nothing changed.  Until... it changed. For no apparent reason. I guess that's just how this is--life, that is.  I know what you mean about gaming; when I played a game I was just plugged in. There was no conflict or uncertainty or boredom, it was just me and the game. And I could count on that feeling every time I played.  Now, I just have to take the cards that have been dealt to me every day. Sometimes it feels like a death march, and sometimes I'm in awe at how full my life is. There's a lot of noise and variation in my emotional state, and most of that noise has nothing to do with me or what I'm doing today. It's just the ebb and flow of chemicals in my brain."

You have to install linux first and I would be too lazy for that. It is important especially if you struggled with not downloading games again and such stuff.  I don't really know what to write.

But I'm old army, and he's basically a pacifist to a degree where mentioning this passion of mine almost always turns into a lengthy discussion of why he'd never join the army or let anyone tell him what to do with his life.   I just don't really know how else to motivate him. I guess I'll start bringing him to the gym where I train and my GF works. It's just that...   He's becoming such a big part of my life at home that I enjoy leaving the house and being around everyone else than him, so for me to be the role model, I'd have to suck it up a lot. And I feel that the fact that he's living here, paying less than half of the rent, living in my bedroom, is a lot for me to give already.   I mean, it's not like he's disabled or broke or mentally ill or anything like that. He's just addicted to gaming and extremely lazy. Maybe he has to hit rock bottom as you said. Maybe that's it. But he never will, because I and the other guys pick him up all the time. Ask him out and do stuff with him when he seems down.   I dunno man. Above all he's a great guy and a good laugh, much like the main character's buddy Ed in ""Shaun of the Dead"" who he resembles in to an almost creepy degree.   I'm just really fed up with his failure to see that he's spending the prime of his youth online battling pixels with other pixels and getting mad and sad because some ""russian kid"" ruined his game.

Shielding an addict from the consequences of their addiction is the surest way to make it worse.  So having said that... I'm not sure what your living situation is, but letting him live in your apartment may or may not be enabling. Something to consider.  If you really want to do what's best for him, then ""going all hardass"" might be a necessary step. His addiction is what is getting in the way of the friendship, not your response to it."
StopGaming,3b8s0t,NajamQureshi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:42:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kinda think the same, regarding me ""enabling"" him to some extend. He gets all his social need covered through me and our handful of friends that he and I share. And I guess he likes talking to my girlfriend too. So there's that.   I used to be all macho and military dude myself, until I had an accident, so I've settled down a lot. Maybe my own ""inactivity"" is enabling him too. I have a lot of stuff going on all the time, but not much physical training which is what I think is one of the few ways to cover both the addiction and anxiety bases for him - getting fit will definitely improve his self-esteem and probably help on his addiction to gaming (and weed??).   Going hardass isn't really an option I guess. Not as long as I'm not the perfect example myself. I'll have a hard time proving him wrong in sitting around if I do the same from time to time. And I'll never get him interested in the armed forces which is where a lot of my free time is spend. He simply thinks of me as a grunt or something along those lines, whenever I bring up the subject.   I am however, going to kick him out in November. That's when I turn 27, and I'm really tired of being a grown man living with another dude in a 2 room apartment. It's getting on my nerves. I used to live in a huge apartment with 5 rooms and 2 stories, before my accident in 2012 - then I lost it. Got my own apartment 8 months ago or something like that. Then he moved in a while after, when he lost his own place due to an asshole-landlord.   Having him move in has been somewhat of a mental set back and it's actually affecting my relationship to both him and with my girlfriend.   I feel like I'm back in the barracks. One of the other issues that come with gaming-addiction is that you're almost ALWAYS home.     I mean, I like the guy, but I'm seeing him half-naked more often than I'm seeing my girlfriend. And she lives like 2min from my place, so the distance is not the issue here. It's his gaming addiction getting on everyone's nerves."

It sounds like you've reached that moment when you know you're done with games.  Being successful in real life is so much more satisfying that in a game. But I would caution that sometimes success is not entirely within your control. You can do everything right, and still fail due to circumstances out of your control.  One simple suggestion I've got is to spend a little time each day on cultivating an inner satisfaction with your life. Meditation, prayer and journaling are three simple daily habits that can go a long way in building an inner happiness that can withstand those unexpected failures. Instead of getting frustrated and beating yourself up, you'll gain the ability to see the failure as just another necessary experience on your path to a happy and fulfilling life."

I had those feelings even when I was still gaming... it's just that the gaming blocked them out. Now that the gaming has been removed, you're left with the crappy feelings and no way to turn them off.  Some habits that I've developed that really helped were meditation and journaling. I used to always get frustrated that I wasn't content with my life, and have this constant restlessness that I needed to change something big to feel good about myself.  I've been meditating and writing every day for over 6 months now, and those feelings have mostly faded away. Other people told me this would happen, and I didn't really believe them. I mean, how could sitting still for 10 minutes a day do anything for my dissatisfaction with life?  But the bottom line is that it seems to be working. I'm happy with who I am and where I am in life. Does this mean all my motivation to get better and to succeed is gone? No, of course not. It's just changed the nature of the motivation. Instead of making decisions based on what will remove unhappiness from my life, I'm looking at what will add happiness instead.

There are a few things you want to know about your situation. The first is that you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have - so to move on you need to identify what they are (you've done this so far by noticing they fill a lot of your time and you find other activities to be boring) and then being intentional with how you fulfill them.

When I was plugged into the game, it's like the rest of my life didn't even exist. Nothing else mattered. And when I removed that, I started feeling things--like boredom--that I didn't know how to deal with.  Years of the constant stimulation provided by gaming has changed your brain, literally. It is wired to expect that kind of feedback. Fortunately, your brain can heal and return to a more normal state, if you just give it time. It might feel hopeless now, but after a few weeks or months, regular life will start to feel a bit more engaging and interesting.  You can think of this feeling as ""withdrawal"" if you want, but the important thing to remember is that it will pass! This feeling won't last forever.

You're probably not even having fun and you know it. They're awful games that feel empty and you're only in for the competitive high. When you go cold turkey it's going to feel like crap for a month or so but afterwards you'll be able to focus better. You'll get better grades and have something to talk about with real people.  This shit is like drugs, only it's colorful and it looks harmless. The faster you get out of the loop, the better. Videogames are the last thing you want to put your time into. Even TV is a better timewaster.  Uninstall Steam and everything else NOW and whenever you'll reinstall, stop yourself. Force of will.

The thing about gaming is that it can act to work in place of other different things that you need in life. I was a DotA player, and for me, it provided the social contact, brain engagement and feeling of fulfillment that I needed.  You can get all of those in real life. Socializing can be done by making friends, you can engage your brain by learning coding or trying to solve math problems (or something else if you really hate math), and you can get the feeling of accomplishment by working out!  These sound like things that would take a lot more time than a single game, but since you are here, I'm assuming that you are not the type of person to play a game a week and then just get up.  If you're learning to play the guitar, pick up something that will take you a while to master. Make a video of it, you might feel proud.  Working out is great.

I've felt the same way you've described yourself and your situation several times throughout the years and share sympathy. Keep in mind that what I discuss here isn't a quick fix, no relapse plan to make your addiction disappear, instead it is a toolkit that I'm presenting to you that can aid in helping you stop your addiction before it spirals out of control, out of control being when it destroys something in your life that you can't get back.  First and foremost I don't believe believe there's an issue with participating in an activity and investing several hours into that activity, rather it's only when that activity interferes with your responsibilities or daily schedule of priorities that it becomes an issue. This is an import distinction to understand and it's the recognition of this distinction that is the first step in realizing one has an addiction, emitting a sense of entrapment and a deep loss of time. Based on what you've written, I believe you are aware that there exists an addiction and require tools to allow you to work through that addiction.   One half of the battle is realizing an addiction is present, and you have conquered this half by being here asking for help. This isn't an easy thing to do and you did it! The other half is understanding that addiction, where it stems from and what maintains it.   A good assignment to do that can help you assess why video games attract you and keep you very much engaged is to list, on a piece of paper, what qualities of the games that you most play, or in general play, you enjoy. What exactly makes video games fun for you? This reflection is crucial and a mandatory first step in exploring the underlying reason as to why you have an addiction to gaming. The other assignment involves listing areas in your life that you're not happy with. Be honest here. What bothers you about your current state of living? What past troubles and memories do you try to repress? Based on experience, there is more often than not a connection between one's happiness and their addiction.   Hopefully these activities can help you understand your situation and can allow you to take control of your life and fix areas in your life that are troubling you.

StopGaming,3b654r,camerondare,2,Sat Jun 27 06:50:16 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing your story and joining us here.  Many of us relate to trying many times before we were finally successful in quitting. I even relapsed once where I played 16 hours a day for five months straight before quitting again and I haven't touched one since.  What you want to know is that relapse isn't necessarily bad if you learn from it, and each time you relapse there will be lessons that can help you. That doesn't mean you should intentionally relapse obviously, just that it gives you clues as to how you can quit for good.  You also want to know that you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have - and in order to be successful to quit you need to identify what these are (you started this by identifying that escape is a big part of it), and then find solutions/fulfill these needs intentionally with other things.  Now new activities is part of the solution yes, but what I want you to also know is that if you play games because you need an escape, you also need to learn how to deal with stress/escapism (see below), because even if you choose new activities you will still experience stress and gaming has always been the way you'd escape it.  Here are a bunch of resources that can help you out. You can also read this post that has more on the needs gaming fulfills, the steps to take to quit and answers to many of the other questions you might have.  Here are a few things to read:   Sunk Cost Fallacy Loss Aversion   And a few videos to watch:   What To Do If You Relapse And Start Gaming Again How To Deal With Stress Without Gaming The Difference Between ""Killing Your Time"" and ""Investing It""   Most importantly, I want you to know you can absolutely quit and start living a life you're proud of. When I first quit my life was a mess and now many of the things you spoke of, having other hobbies (passions), having a real social life, being active, being an interesting and healthy person... these are all things I too have worked on developing and have seen immense progress in.  There's no reason you can't do it too if you follow the advice on the sub and take action to implement it.  Posting here is a great first step so be proud of yourself for taking it!"

It was the most complete escape ever, almost like heroin.  If you can quit gaming, but still browse the internet for hours at a time, you're better off than if you still played games. So don't beat yourself up if you stop gaming but still feel like you're wasting all your time. If you make it to the end of the day without gaming, then that day is a success no matter what else happens.  Of course, quitting games would seem pointless if you're still deeply unhappy with your life. If you really want to recover from this, you can take some simple actions that will help.  For me, talking to other people who share my problem was a really big help. I could hear about the path they took, what worked and what didn't. Eventually I started meditating and writing in a journal on a daily basis, both of which were recommendations from other addicts, and those two habits have worked wonders for my mood and general happiness."

Only my closest people knew. I didn't want anyone to know, especially in school, because I knew how much damage gaming caused in my life. The fact that I thought bad about gaming, made me also think that other ""normal people"" thought bad about gaming, thus the ""hiding"". I didn't want to get associated with gaming. It's like in this video: I just could not stop. I was ashamed of myself.   Since I quit gaming, I talk openly about my addiction problem and try to make people understand my story. Because I talk about my past, I do no longer feel ashamed when I tell people that I used to play 10 hours a day if I had nothing better to do.  And I also encoutered this certain problem with gamer friends of mine. When I declared my negativ opinion about gaming, they instantly went in a kind of defensive state. I didn't know how to properly explain my current view on videos games in a neutral way. Thanks to this video, I now know better and will try to approach this topic in a different way."
StopGaming,3b37pj,Scriptopeia,2,Thu Jun 25 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"I really identify with how your gamer friends reacted to your quitting. When you're a gamer, it becomes part of your identity, so when you reject gaming, these people can't help but take it personally: you're rejecting a part of who they are. This is also why casual drinkers sometimes resent abstainers, or why someone who hates on your favourite musician can be personally hurtful.  Stupid mammal brains, nothing we can really do about it."

There are reasons why gamers are naturally defensive and it has to do with the public shaming we get, but I hope by us sharing our story more and shaping it intentionally we can shift the general narrative towards gamers in the public eye.  Ironically, the shaming we get from the outside world only encourages us to play more, because it's not only our way of dealing with stress/rejection, but it's also where we feel accepted and welcome.

StopGaming,3b4ent,boegehaven,5,Thu Jun 25 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"In answer to the opening question, yes, absolutely, but not as directly as you might think.  Personally, I experience games as an addiction, so what alcohol is to an alcoholic, video games of all kinds are to me.  If I start, I can't stop...and sadly, I lack the ability to prevent myself from starting.  I tried quite a few times to either control or moderate my gaming, and nothing worked.  What's been working for me for the past ~18 months is a 12 Step recovery program focused on gaming addiction.  All of my previous attempts at quitting meant gritting my teeth and forcing myself to not play no matter how much I wanted to.  Since I was still thinking about gaming and/or doing other escapist activities all the time, life didn't particularly improve and I would always go back to the games at some point.  Working a 12 Step program has helped a lot.  It was extremely difficult for me at first, partly because once I quit gaming and started doing a decent job avoiding all of my other escapist behaviors, I began needing to deal with all of the stuff my addiction had kept me from noticing the whole time.  There was (and is) an immense amount of this kind of stuff in my life, so learning how to deal with it in a good and healthy way took a lot of time and a willingness to learn how to live life very differently than I had at any point in the past.  Ultimately, it's the other changes that I see as being the big ones that have made my life SOOOO much more worthwhile.  I don't hate myself anymore.  I'm a far more compassionate person than I ever was before, and I'm able to deal with rough times in life without touching a game (which I never used to be able to do).  I could go on for a while about the changes I've seen in my life as a result of working a good recovery program, but that would take more time and typing than I care for right now. :)  So...all of that happened, and made life much better than it ever was before...but none of that would have been able to happen if I'd still been gaming.  So the fact that I don't game today HAS changed my life...but only because it made possible all the other changes that are really transforming me.  I don't recommend the pure willpower approach (aka ""white-knuckling"").  It's hard, exhausting, and prone to failure at the worst possible moments.  A good recovery program makes a world of difference, and I highly recommend one.  I hope all goes well for you."

I found martial arts to be very helpful probable because of the fact that it has an aspect to it where you progress (sort of like leveling up in a game).

StopGaming,3b4ent,navi-thejedimaster,2,Sat Jun 27 06:58:43 2015 UTC,"YES.  When I quit I did it because I wanted to improve my social skills and start living my life to the fullest. It hasn't been easy but over the years it's all snowballed into big improvements in my life.  Here are a few of the highlights. I don't mean to share this to ""brag"", I just want you to see that there are real improvements you can make if you stick with it + focus on learning what you need to learn to improve:  Here are a few highlights of what I’ve accomplished since I quit gaming:   I have my own business and work for myself. This gives me the freedom and flexibility to do what I want. I’ve traveled all around the world. (Currently writing this in Thailand, country #20) I’ve given two TEDx talks. (A big dream of mine!) I learned to DJ and even performed in Prague. (DJing is one of my biggest passions now.) I’m surrounded by a great group of friends who inspire me. (When I first quit my only friends were fellow gamers who held me back.)   More importantly, I’m happier than I’ve ever been, I’m proud of who I am and I wake up excited to be alive and live my life to the fullest.  If you want to see where I was when I first quit, it's here:  My Life Was A Complete Mess:   I battled depression, struggled with low self-esteem and “feeling good enough.” I didn’t have very many friends, and the ones I did have were gamers. Not only that, but I didn’t even know how to make friends. I lacked confidence in general, especially with women, was constantly put in the dreaded friend zone and didn’t feel attractive as a man. I had little education, had dropped out of high school twice and never graduated, had no desire to go back or to ever go to college. I was in and out of jobs all the time, lasted two days as a landscaper, worked as a dishwasher at Earls, lasted about a week stocking shelves at Walmart, and disappeared from my jobs at Papa Johns Pizza and Booster Juice. Worst of all, to avoid having to get another job I deceived my parents by pretending to have a job at a restaurant and again at an internet cafe.   The one highlight in my life was gaming, but as the reality of the above came more and more in focus in my life, I came to acknowledge that although gaming wasn’t the cause of these issues, it was what allowed me to avoid having to deal with the situation.  So yes, you can make real progress. But it starts by focusing on learning what you need to learn to get to where you want to be. It starts with recognizing where you are at, and where you want to go. And then learning what you need to to get there.  Becoming a social person doesn't just happen. It's something you have to work at. Think about it like you are the character you get to build in this world, you have different skills and talents, and to improve them you need to go on missions and quests to complete. If you want to improve your social skills, you need to go on missions that will help you facilitate that. You have to take action. Try meetups and get out of the house more. Read How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, read The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson, start hanging out in environments where you can meet people and practice interacting. Listen to The Art of Charm podcast. etc.  Hope that helps."

There are things you can do that will speed up the pace of change though. For me, I started seeing really noticeable changes after I began the habits of meditation and writing in a journal. These two habits in particular are like a strong foundation in your life that you can use to start adding other things to. For example, improving your social skills or learning a language.

Three things keep me energized: A healthy amount of sleep (and a consistent sleep cycle), three meals with snacks in between (meaning enough calories to keep me going), and exercise (it started as lifting weights, but now I just play basketball for hours - hoop is life!!)    A normal human being? Well I've never been normal.    Here is the thing about motivation that I learned recently. Motivation is a spark, an idea, something that gets you to start a new activity or follow up on a new idea. ""Hey I want to go lift weights today!"" So you go lift weights one day, and then don't go back to the gym ever again. The cool thing about motivation is that it gets you in the door, but the thing that's even more powerful than motivation is self-discipline. This is the muscle I've been exercising the most (and I fail a lot, which sucks, but it's part of the process). It's what keeps you going back to the gym.    Eventually it becomes habitual. Oh shit, I really want to go to the gym today. Damn I really want to make breakfast today. I'm glad I got up early today.    These are all things that go through my mind now.    I would say do one step at a time.    Keep off the games, and try one new thing everyday. Wake up and make your bed.

Sometimes everyday, sometimes once per week, sometimes for hours and hours. I deal with it by doing different things - the first thing I like to do is knock out 30 pushups. Then I decide what's next on the list - exercise? homework? take a bath? bitch on reddit?    Reading a book became entertaining again when I got rid of constant stimulation. I deleted snapchat, I avoid using my phone when I'm waiting, I try not to click every reddit link. The first step was to be able to focus on the book - after getting rid of flashing lights, multiple links, checking the fucking minimap every two seconds, articles I skim, etc., I was able to sit down and read. It's pretty great, actually, I focus a lot better now.    I'm bipolar, so I picked up a book, An Unquiet Mind, that is pretty true to some of my experiences. That was good. Next I moved to a sci-fi book called Foundation, by Isaac Asimov. I've wanted to start my own business for a while now, so I checked up on Elon Musk (he started his own business to say the least). Elon is a big book guy, and on his top 10 reading list was a book about benjamin franklin. I picked up that book and it's great!    Everyday activities become fun? Well... I dislike chores, if that's what you're asking. Those won't be fun. What I do find fun, however, is class. I engage in class. I sit in the front, I talk to my teacher a lot, and I have a really great time (while learning, of course.) The more you do things, the less tedious they'll become, that's for sure. You'll never have a chore where you have to scrape mold off of your floor that will be fun (unless you're a micro biologist... then you might microscope that mold).    I actually do find a lot of things interesting that other people don't notice. I was checking out a baby lizard yesterday - I'd never seen one that small before.

It's kind of scary if you've been a shut-in and an introvert (as gamers tend to be) for most of your life, but if you're with another person, even virtually on a forum, then you're less likely to give in to the voice in your head that wants to game.  I'm the biggest danger to myself when I am alone. That was a crazy realization, because most of my life I thought I was an introvert and needed time to myself in order to ""recharge"". But when I am alone, my brain comes up with some crazy thoughts, and if I don't have anyone else to bounce them off of then I start to believe them. And then I do stupid things like reinstall the game I deleted half a dozen times before."

But as I began recovering from that addiction, I had this nagging feeling that I had a problem with gaming too. Honestly, games had been causing problems in my life for a lot longer than alcohol, but the consequences from the alcohol were just more severe.  In any case, I talked to a lot of people about it. I said that I think I need to quit gaming as well. The advice I got was that when I was ready to quit, I would do it; no need to make it more complicated than that. This didn't seem very helpful, but it was enough.  I started paying a lot more attention to my gaming habits. I didn't play all the time, but I did start to notice some subtle negative effects it was having on me that I hadn't really noticed before. Finally, one weekend I played for like 2 days straight, and neglected to do a bunch of assignments that were coming due. That was the moment when I knew I was done. And I haven't played since then.  I guess my point is that watching porn isn't a problem until it's a problem. There are people who say porn can really mess up your life, and that may be true. But it doesn't seem like porn has had the same effect on you as gaming. So focus on what you need to do to quit gaming, and just be aware of your other behaviors. If there comes a time when you need to stop watching porn, trust that you will know and be ready to do it."

But the things that were not addictions, like watching videos and reading fiction, were a help to me in the first few months off games, even though I spent too much time on them and did neglect other things.  The main thing I learned is that I have dysfunctional thought and behavior patterns that need to change.  Excessive gaming was but a symptom of my underlying problems.  The best thing I did was get involved with a group of people working on exactly these issues and making good progress on them.  In CGAA meetings, I got support, encouragement, understanding and guidance.  Trying to make progress all by myself was an exercise in futility.  Working together with a group and learning from each other's successes and failures, being accountable to each other, and supporting each other made the difference.

I learned a lot, and since it helped me understand why I'd decided to play again, it helped me have a lot more compassion for myself than I'd ever had before.  It was a novel experience for me to not hate myself for ""failing"", but I think it was a big deal.  One of my favorite quotes comes from an addiction specialist named Gabor Mate.

StopGaming,3b2qyg,wookieshark88,4,Thu Jun 25 14:26:29 2015 UTC,"I relate to quite a bit of this.  I didn't have anybody who ""got"" it in terms of just how important games were to me.  I started gaming as a little kid and can see signs of addiction from very early on (now that I know what to look for).  ""Bad"" games (like free flash games) are perfectly capable of becoming consuming obsessions that lead me to ignore everything else in life.  One of my first activities on a new computer (now) is to uninstall every single game that came pre-installed (including solitaire and free cell).  I didn't want to stop, but disliked the consequences of not stopping too much to just keep playing.  I've stayed away on my own before, but have always gone back sooner or later (usually sooner).  So yeah...I definitely get it.  I'm glad you found this sub.  Finding people who ""get it"" when I talk about being addicted to video games has been a big help for me, and I'm guessing it will be for you as well.  Probably the single biggest difference maker for me has been finding a 12-Step recovery program.  Going to meetings and working the program suggested to me by other members of that recovery fellowship has probably saved my life.  I used to be so depressed and filled with self-hatred that suicide not only seemed like a viable option, but it was something I considered doing quite a bit.  Today I rarely find myself even considering that as an option, and when I do, it feels out of place and tends to bounce me in a much better direction.  It wasn't easy, and probably the only thing I did right when I was first starting was I refused to give up.  I relapsed regularly, but always came back, told people what had happened, and then asked for help.  Things are different now.  I haven't touched a game in just over 18 months, and I'm a very different person on top of it...and I like the new me an awful lot better than the old me.  Just don't give up."

I personally wanted to travel and work from my laptop, so I only need that and it works for me.

Some people need to stop gaming entirely in any way, others can deal with an occasional game on the phone, some play games with friends from time to time...  This may sound pretty vague and probably not the thing you are looking for. But you have to find out what you are addicted to and what makes you spend all day gaming, neglecting everything else.  This can take a bit of trial and error if you are not certain. Do you think you cannot control the amount of time you spend playing on your phone? Then quit it.   For me personally, I tried to convince myself that this and that would be ok, but nothing was. It was no particular game, it was not multiplayer games only, it does not matter if it is alone, with friends, on mobile devices or whatnot.

I play chess myself and for me it's all about how I handle it. I noticed some slight increase of my online playtime in chess since I quit League of Legends, but I kept an eye on it.

I've always been a big fan of board games, but I don't play them very often because it's tough to get a bunch of players together. About a month ago I attended a ""game night"" event where I played a variety of board games with some classmates. It was fun, but I noticed something when I had to leave at the end of the night.  My mind felt kind of twisted, and it was a familiar feeling--I used to get the same feeling after playing video games. Something about the strategizing and the virtual world created by the board game flipped that switch in my brain.  I realized that the bottom line is I am addicted to games. Video games are special, because they never stop. You can game forever on a computer. In real life, not so much. So I guess I'm not worried much about playing board games addictively.  But after getting used to life without video games, I can honestly say that I don't like the feeling that I get after I play a board game. And that in and of itself is probably enough reason for me to stay away.  EDIT: I guess I didn't really answer the question. Chess in real life? Probably fine. Chess on your phone?

StopGaming,3azxcq,acereco,6,Wed Jun 24 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"Can you really escape?   Yes!  It wasn't easy or straight-forward, but I did.  First, I spent a couple years trying to moderate or stop on my own and found that all of those attempts failed.  Next, I found a group of people who supported each other in staying off games, and that really helped.  They understood me, I could relate to them, and we encouraged each other.  It felt great to not be alone in this.  But I didn't take my gaming compulsion so seriously, since I really wanted it to be a passing phase, to be no big deal.  So, I tried gaming again and was dragged down back into all the same ol' messes.  I stopped again for several months, really turned my life around for the better, but again was sucked back into gaming, thinking I would control it much better now, that it would be different.  Nine months later, my life was a disaster and I was in pain.  This time around, I go to plenty of meetings of the CGAA fellowship, listen to what worked for others, and try out their suggestions.  It's been working for over three years now.  No games.  I have escaped the vicious cycle.  If a hardcore compulsive game-lover like me can stop, so can you.

The reason I do it is because I believe in our ability as gamers to overcome this problem and start living our life to the fullest. I really believe that it's possible for us to not only get ours lives back but to use this time as a turning point to start creating a truly remarkable life for ourselves.  I do it because I went through it myself and just believe there's much more to the story than that we simply struggle with games. My next video coming out tomorrow on YouTube talks about how to share our story with the world (or ""normal people"") and in it I talk more about how our movement is only at the beginning. And as it grows it's really important for us to shape the conversation in a positive and productive manner. But it's up to us to do this otherwise our cause will go the same way others have - where nobody gives a shit about them.  One of my favorite quotes is from this video with Elon Musk. Chris Anderson (curator for TED) asks him why he's taking on solar, space and electric cars, three major issues to tackle... at the same time! and he says something along the lines of that ""they are too important for our world and nobody else is doing it so fuck it, I guess I'll do it.""  I feel similar with this gaming issue. It's too important for our world and I relate too much to everyone going through it to not contribute to the community and help the community forward, not only in offering real solutions that work, because if you want to quit something you deserve help and support to do so... (bad advice that is very common, especially from parents really just pisses me off), but also to help the world understand more about what's really going on here and how we can heal the reasons why addictions like this occur in the first place (instead of just offering bandaid solutions all the time that don't fix the real problem.)  Hope you're having a great day!"

Moving: I can imagine that was extremely isolating. I've made 4 drastic moves within the states through out my life. I'm still pretty crappy at making a smooth transition. Thankfully I never had to deal with tooooo massive of a cultural and language barrier though. Moves generally aren't easy for the psyche; in my experience. Where are you from and why did you move?

Posting here is a great step, so good job! :)  Congrats on quitting today! What's amazing about this process is that you can learn so much about yourself and how to be successful by being aware of when you play. It's important to remember that you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have - so to be successful in quitting you need to identify what these needs are and find new, healthy and intentional ways of fulfilling them.  For instance, you play more when you have less going on, so you'll want to choose new activities and then be conscious of your time (use a calendar or agenda) to schedule your day and know where your time is going.  To prevent a relapse and be successful in quitting, you want to follow the advice in this post. Not only will it help you identify the key steps to take but it will also answer other questions you might be thinking about.  Follow that thread and take action on the advice and you'll be moving forward in no time.

Gaming caused problems for me in school as well; I failed out of two different universities as a consequence of my addiction.  Having other things to do with your time is really important to recovery, because it helps keep your mind off of gaming when you're busy. But there will come times when you don't know what to do with yourself, when you get that restless feeling, and those are the most difficult to get through.  I've found that the difference between now and all the other times I tried (unsuccessfully) to quit gaming is that I'm focused on changing the internal attitudes and beliefs that lead me to compulsive gaming. This has required a lot of sharing my story with others, listening to their stories and taking suggestions, as well as taking up reflective habits like meditation and journaling.  This forum is a great source of support, as well as CGAA meetings. Don't hesitate to reach out to anyone here and build a personal network of support, it is easily the single most valuable thing you can do to protect against a relapse."

As the common maxim goes: if we could moderate, we wouldn't be here.  Like many people here, when I originally recognised my problem, I quit cold turkey. Things are alright, so I decided to return to gaming with the promise that I wouldn't play for more than an hour a day. Cue my major four month relapse, a disaster. I have tried ""moderation"" three times now and it always led to binging and destruction of my progress.  So in short I am firmly opposed to moderation for addicts.

I told myself: I will play tonight, and if I play again tomorrow and binge, I'll know I'm not able to return.  But video games destroy sense of judgement and clarity.   Alcohol commercials warn you not to binge: ""Know when to stop!"" Is a joke. Being drunk is when you should stop and ironically when you'll least likely realise this. Gaming is similar for me.  Once I started, it began a cycle: I'd think about it whenever I wasn't playing, I had had my taste of gaming again and couldn't shake it. It changed my priorities and motivations in a matter of days till I, like the drunk man warned not to binge, simply didn't care any more. Bring on the shots.  After four days back into the game, the pretence of moderation was gone. Remember, my intention was to moderate so that I could continue my healthy lifestyle, exercise, socialise. Once gaming reentered my life, these aspects paled in comparison to the stimulation of a killstreak. Why moderate when the reasons for moderation no longer mattered?   I was now plugged in, so beginning four months where I was about as fulfilled and productive as a navel gazing sloth."

As I used to play LoL a lot, I now made a rule that I can only play when I have a full lobby of friends, for a maximum of an hour a day (often one Summoners Rift, or 2 aram/3v3's).   After going without a game for 2 days, I noticed that when I started a game on the third day with my buddies, I got pulled into playing a second game. Not necessarily by them, but just by me thinking:' I'm playing with my friends, I'm being social and having fun, I can do another one' I ended up playing only 2,5 hours, but it was too far beyond my limit. Maybe it's just some getting used to, but most games are not created to make you play for just an hour. 3 hours might be more easily kept, but I found that too little change, and wanted less gaming.  Even though I am far from totally addicted, it's tough to stop gaming once I've opened the game. I'll give it one more shot to moderate it, but if it fails again, I think I will remove LoL. So I dont think that addicts are capable of moderating, or they must have some envying willpower. But for people who aren't too deeply addicted, I think moderation should be possible."

I played League of Legends and I took it very competitive.

StopGaming,3aygrk,jotakami,2,Wed Jun 24 18:56:11 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing and joining us here. This is definitely a common step many of us reach, where we realize although we did enjoy playing games for a period of time, we may not necessarily enjoy them as much any longer. This can be happening for a few reasons but mostly it just has to do with the fact that games stimulated you in different ways before because of whatever the situation was going on in your life, which can be for any variety of reasons.  But now you're in a different place but you're still using gaming as your main activity because it's just what you know. This is more of a sign that you're changing internally and starting to look for something more meaningful in your life, that gaming no longer fulfills.   Quitting gaming can be a major turning point in your life, and I felt the same way - like a meaningless human being - when I quit. At the time I had no friends, I had no confidence or self-esteem, no social skills, no passions, I was depressed, I had dropped out of high school (twice), and I had no idea at all about how to move forward.  But I knew gaming wasn't making me happy any more and at some point I had to make a shift to start being happy and fulfilled, I had to start learning how to become a meaningful human being. So that's the journey I went on and it's been crazy and awesome. It hasn't been easy but it's been worth it.

You feel this way because all the life and imagination has literally been stripped from you. The word ""magic"" stems from Imagination or Imagus (I, the magician) where literally in ancient knowledge the imagination was known to be the creative force behind magic. The video games (and all form of media now days) have had black magic cast on them in order to strip you of your imagination or magical properties which exist at a subconscious level. The energy is then fed to illuminati/archons.  This sounds pretty far fetched but I have experiential evidence for my claims. For example in my effort to remove layers of media programming I literally encountered Super Mario in my subconscious. The being was actually animated to life by the powerful imagination of my inner child, where the energy remained imprisoned till that very day.  Also, they are making games totally crappy these days. It's not just you."

StopGaming,3ayvk3,reivolver,3,Wed Jun 24 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Thanks for joining us here and sharing your story. Many of us have failed to quit a few times before we were able to finally be successful. The key is to keep going and learn from each one what worked and what didn't and implement it the next time.  It's important to know that quitting gaming can be a turning point in your life. All of the things you want to do, getting a job, getting out and socializing, starting a business, a blog, etc, these are all things you can pursue.  The reason you play games is because they are what you know and they are the way you fulfill unmet needs. By learning about these needs and being intentional with how you fill them (you have a great list of things you want to work on already!), you will be able to move on from games.  What I recommend is for you to read this post and follow the advice in it. If you do that you can absolutely be successful.  When I quit I was depressed, had no friends, had no idea how to make friends, had no job, no passions, etc. What I wanted though was to start learning how to make friends, I wanted to start my own business and work for myself, and I wanted to wake up every day feeling excited to be alive.  Now a few years later and after a lot of hard work I'm currently typing this to you from Thailand where I've been traveling with a really cool girl I met a few months ago, working on my laptop every day and feeling proud of the life I've created for myself. It wasn't easy but it's been worth it.  Follow the advice in that thread and you'll find many of the answers you're looking for, including:   What to do about your friends. Watch this. What triggers to watch out for. Watch this. What to do when you have urges. Watch this.   We've got your back, let me know if we can answer any other questions you have, Happy you're here with us."

I think that is my main issue. I just posted an ad to sell my whole entire setup, so perhaps that will help.  Also, would you recommend any meds or something to help me focus to achieve more? I'm against drugs in general, but I am at my end here. I found this article: http://www.supplementhq.com/brain/  Do you have a website that I can go to?

I've been on Adderall before for focus and although it helped, the side effects were really horrible. What you want to see is that ""Focus"" is a skill or a muscle that you need to develop just like anything else.  There's a lot of good advice and websites out there. Here are a few:   Zen Habits (he has a book for free on Focus.) Getting Things Done by David Allen 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey (check out this video)   For startups, I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for but there are a few resources I like to follow below.

As with any goal in life, the best thing to do is to find people who have accomplished what you want and try out the things that worked well for them.  You've found some here and can find more in CGAA meetings.  Just show up and listen.  You don't have to talk if you don't want, don't have to give anything.  I found that being around other people who were so much like me, understood me easily, wanted to help and encourage me, and successfully accomplished things I wanted to accomplish was a huge help.  There's this say, ""We become like those with whom we surround ourselves.""  I found it to be true.  Keep coming back and speaking up.  There's a lot of support available."
StopGaming,3ayvk3,farthestworld,2,Thu Jun 25 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with and second everything /u/camerondare said. I just want to add a couple things.  First off, give yourself huge props for taking the time to post here. That shows you have a desire to improve your situation and make a difference in your life. You should feel good about that.  Secondly, a $1000 PC isn't a bad investment. You can do a lot of things with a PC. You can certainly sell it and recoup a lot of what you spent. Or you can install Linux and start playing around with programming. Or you could dabble in graphic design, or writing, or whatever suits your fancy. Acknowledge that you made a decision that felt right at the time. Don't regret it, just accept that it was the best decision you felt you could make at the time. Now take stock of where you are, and try to make the best decision you can with what you now know and feel. As a longtime Mac user, I can tell you you absolutely DON'T need one right now. You can do anything you need to do with that machine you have. Also, if you think that owning the computer will make you continue spending time on games, then it might make sense to sell it.  Finally, I'd like to really encourage you to look into meditation, ideally Zen but probably any established Buddhist tradition will be good. It will help you with your anger towards yourself, and in general, and it will also dramatically improve your ability to make decisions about what you want to do in your life. It's a bit involved explaining how and why this works, but if you'd like to know more about it feel free to message me, and I will happily answer questions or direct you to some resources to learn more. Meditation has really changed my life and shown me how to love myself, and gain clarity and self-control.  Best of luck! You can succeed at this!"
StopGaming,3ayvk3,jotakami,2,Wed Jun 24 17:40:14 2015 UTC,"Welcome brother, you're in the right place. We all have struggled with the same things--not just the gaming, but a lack of meaning and purpose in our lives.  I did a lot of the same things in my search for an answer. I've been to therapists, took antidepressants, read countless self-help books... and nothing seemed to stick. Even if things changed and I felt better for a short time, in the end I would always start feeling that hole inside of me, and fall back on gaming to fill the hole.  Quitting games (and alcohol, I have a problem with that too) was the first step on a long road of recovery. First, I found a group of people who shared my problem with whom I could speak honestly and openly about it. I met people who had felt that exact same misery and despair about their lives, and had found a way to overcome it. I listened to their stories and came to accept that I could follow in their footsteps and change my life.  Second, I listened to their advice and followed it. That required me to do a lot of things I'd never done before in my life. I now meditate, pray, and write in a journal every single day. They are probably the most important things I will do each and every day. I didn't do any of these things before I quit gaming. Hell, I couldn't even get myself to brush my teeth every day.  Finally, I just trusted the process would work. It's hard to see how doing these things has any connection to my happiness. And the external conditions of my life didn't change at all during my process of recovery. The human mind is a funny thing; we simply can't imagine having a different view of the world than we do now. What we believe to be the truth right now feels like it will be the truth forever. In fact, we can change. It just takes time and willingness. The habits I mentioned above will give you the willingness to change, if you practice them consistently. Then you can just leave it up to time.  After 16 months without alcohol and 7 months without games, I feel like a different person. I'm still married to the same woman, I'm still living in the same apartment, I have about the same amount of money and possessions... but the internal world of my mind has been transformed. My motivation to do things now comes from the joy of living a life well lived, not from the guilt and shame of trying to hate myself into becoming a better person.  You can do this man. But if you start with the idea that you need to whip yourself into shape, then you're not going to build a sustainable change in your life.   I want to be happy and to give the love that my girlfriend deserves, but I can't because I don't love myself.   This is the place to start from. Learn to love yourself, then everything else will come in time. And the best way to do that is to find people who used to hate themselves, ask them how they changed, and follow their path."

There's the ideal you, the one you want, but it's hard to become that guy and it's a lot easier to jump into a fantasy world where you're instantly him.  There's an analogy that works well with this type of situation. You can have cotton candy now or you can have steak later. You can throw your hands up and just go for that instant satisfaction of sweetness but it's ultimately empty. There's nothing of value and you're left just as hungry as when you began. Furthermore, it's just plain bad for you. On the other hand, you can wait a little. Work at it, save up some cash, go to the butcher's a buy yourself a thick steak. It'll take some tenderizing and some marinating, you'll have to watch the grill closely to make sure you're cooking it right but in the end you'll have a delicious meal. It will be completely satisfying, healthy, and worth all the work in the end.  So it's time to get to work. Decide what you want, find out how to get it, and change yourself to be who you want to be. We're all on the journey."

One of the key insights I had that helped me quit is that there's a difference between having fun and being happy. Games are fun (especially because our brains like them so much) but that doesn't mean we're necessarily happy when we play them (we were at some point but maybe not any more, and that's ok.)  It's time to turn your life into the ultimate video game and recognize that YOU are the character you get to build in this life.  And this gets to be an incredible turning point for you. You can look back on this in 90 days, six months, a year from now and be blown away at how much progress you've made.  Follow the steps outlined here and they will help you a lot. When I quit gaming I did it because I was tired of living a life I wasn't proud of and I wanted to become the type of guy I wanted to be. I wanted to take ownership of creating the life I always wanted.  I wanted to be around people who inspired me (I had no friends when I quit gaming), I wanted to work for myself and start my own business, I wanted to wake up every day excited to be alive and I wanted to be happy.

StopGaming,3avkkt,camerondare,2,Wed Jun 24 12:05:57 2015 UTC,"I also fell for the Heartstone trap. Dig yourself out of it like your life depended on it. It leads NOWHERE!  What really helped me quit that game was when I definitively realized beyond any doubt that the matches LITERALLY were decided by random number generators and have NO skill involved whatsoever. It's like: if you could choose between having 10 dollars or 20 dollars for free which would you choose? It will always, always be the best choice or twenty dollars. Likewise there was NO skill or strategy involved for HS, and the matches were determined by sheer luck.  What also killed it was the fact that over 60% of the matches I played were against bots. Yep, people decided to just run their bot and rake in the gold coins because it became such a grind to get cards.  Long story short, that game is actually very boring and meaningless once you realize you aren't even the deciding factor in matches; RNG is."

StopGaming,3auth6,Ticianus,3,Tue Jun 23 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"I was also a gamer ever since I was very young. I tried to quit countless times, but always came back to gaming. I've finally quit for good, at age 31.  I think the key was to recognize that my gaming was a lot deeper than just a way to pass the time. I had some fundamental views about the world and about myself that prevented me from breaking free from the games. It was only after I started working on changing my mindset that I was able to kick the habit for good.  The first step is to just make it through today without gaming. All you need is today. If you really feel an uncontrollable urge to play, just tell yourself you'll play tomorrow. When tomorrow comes, you can deal with it then.  After a few weeks or a month without gaming, you'll start to feel a lot better. You won't get bored so easily, and the urge to play won't be quite as strong. But if you really want this change to last, then you have to do some work. It's not hard work, but it's real work. Connect with other people who have quit gaming, and practice self-reflection through meditation and journaling.  If you can do this stuff and stick with it through the ups and downs, then I can promise you that not only will you be able to quit gaming for good, but you'll also create a foundation of peace and stability in your life that you never expected."

Browse these threads and you'll see a lot of suggestions.  Best advice I can give you is to just try and look ahead. It's tough for a fifteen year old to do but you seem pretty on the ball, recognizing a problem so early and actively taking steps to fix it. So try and imagine yourself ten years from now.

It's a great question and one that has a few layers of complexity, but like /u/Ssegrum said, if you're considering it that's a good place to focus and it's worth going 30 days off just to experience it.  So there are a few other things to consider with your post.   Your daily routine. We all have routines and many of us who get caught playing games a lot have one similar to yours. It's just our default activity when we come home from our day. Part of the reason why this happens is because we have a mindset about our obligations and our free time. You went to work all day and fulfilled your obligations, so why can't you just come home and game and browse reddit? Check out this video where I talk more about that and what to do instead. Boredom. Part of the reason why you can experience boredom (or lack of enjoyment) in games and in other activities is because of changes that occur to your brain from overexposure to gaming. You can learn more about this here and a more in-depth perspective here. The good news is, there are likely reasons why this is happening but there are solutions to shift it.   Remember, your routine is just what you do every day, so by being more intentional with your time, you can create new results for yourself.   Step 1 is about choosing new hobbies. This thread and this thread have a ton of ideas for you. Step 2 is to schedule your day (after work) so you know what you are going to do, instead of just defaulting to your autopilot (reddit, fb, steam, gw2.)   Finally, one of the things you will want to consider is that the type of stimulation (refer to the videos from #2 Boredom) you get from gaming is much different than the type of stimulation you get from drawing. It's not that you may not enjoy drawing, but in comparison to gaming you will find them much different.  So the solution is a few things:   Make sure you find an activity that is mentally engaging like gaming. To improve your chances of enjoying drawing, spend a focused amount of time on it, say 15-30 minute blocks at a time, and maybe do it out of the house at a Starbucks with headphones on or the library where you can focus on that instead of at home where you will want to game.   Hope that helps. We're all in this together and we've got your back. Let me know if we can help answer any other questions!"

One thing I've noticed when it comes to playing games is that any good game has that feeling of chasing a golden carrot. Be it winning your next match, getting that next armor upgrade,  so try and transfer that to other hobbies. Try and better yourself in whatever you choose to do and that should help you stick at something a little easier."
StopGaming,3arbe5,Riamuu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:12:09 2015 UTC,"Gaming is great for just erasing discomfort and consuming time. After a long enough time spent gaming, you start to lose the ability to tolerate discomfort or boredom. As you said, ""there is no enjoyment."" And that's a problem.  Normal people don't enjoy every minute of every day. They just don't. It's a silly idea that gets planted into our heads somehow. And so when we try something new, and don't enjoy it, we drop it and move on.  Games do such a good job of blotting out this lack of enjoyment, that I'm convinced you have to completely remove the games in order to work on restoring your ability to be uncomfortable and still continue with whatever you are doing. This doesn't happen to everyone, but from the way you describe your ""non-functional"" feedback mechanism I think you fall into this category.  So, welcome to the group. We're here for you if you decide to quit."

Until I started working to uncover and re-write those scripts, I couldn't change my gaming habits.  You might find that cutting back is more difficult than you thought. Or you could make it through the month cold turkey without much trouble, but your gaming returns to exactly the same level as before when you start again. If you find yourself facing these problems, it might be helpful to dig a little deeper into why you want to play less, and what changes you might need to make in other parts of your life to support that.  That probably sounds really vague, so I guess I can be more explicit by saying that I meditate, pray, and write in a journal every single day. I do a lot of self-reflection, and I didn't do any of that stuff when I was still gaming. It has really made the difference not just in quitting games, but in many other changes I've made in my life."

It's important to know you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have - and to move on from them you need to identify these needs and fulfill them, intentionally, in other means.  What you're experiencing is common, for awhile gaming was something that you did because it was fun, but now it's different and that's ok.  Binging during the summer tends to happen because of a specific mindset we have about how we see our obligations and free time. The good news is you managed to be more in balance during the school year, which means there are certain ways you approach the school year that are different than the summer. I'd spend some time thinking about how you approach the school year (specifically your free time, getting involved in things) and how that changes during the summer. I'd also watch this video and this video.  If you want to stop there are a few steps you need to take:   Read this article first. It will teach you about the needs gaming fulfills.    Then:   Uninstall/Delete your games. Choose new activities. Here is a thread w/ ideas. Setup a daily schedule. Try and be out of the house as much as possible where your temptations will be the lowest.   You've already setup your badge so good job on that! The urge is more about your brain wanting to game than you wanting to game. This video can teach you about the research behind why this happens.  Hope that helps!

When doing drugs daily you build up a tolerance. You need more to ge the job done. And you may even reach a point where you barely feel high even though you consume way more than any other person you know. It can get pretty ridiculous.  With gaming too I built up a tolerance. Where having a good streak was once fun it kind of became the baseline. Having a good K/D ratio was now needed to feel normal and being average started to become infuriating. To have fun I needed to utterly dominate everyone. And even that had the potential to become the baseline. I too remember having to stop because I became so angry I was about to smash my equipment.

If I logged in and lost one game of league I would have a terrible day until I won at least 2 or 3. Even if I lost I would just blame teammates (sometimes justified) and keep playing because I knew I was better than where I was. If I played WoW I wouldnt really mind until pvp started and then losing would be pretty frustrating, but not as bad as league.  I am really competitive and when I lose in a game or dont perform up to my expectations I just feel really inferior and self loathe until I get better. I have this urge to be the best at everything, even though I know its not entirely realistic, its been a driving force. Its been less about doing something for its own sake and more for being better than someone else."

Gaming fulfilled certain needs you have, and one of the ways to think about that is that gaming fulfilled them all through one activity, but when you quit you need a few different ones in specific areas to counter what gaming did for you.  They fall into three main categories:   Mentally Engaging Activity: something that is achievement/skill based. Resting Activity: something to do at home when you're tired from working out and/or bored. Social Activity: something to help you make new friends.

""You mean you encourage potential alcoholics to go out and get drunk? And possibly damage their lives further?!"" Yes, because someone who is unsure about the severity of their problem will never be able to walk the road to recovery anyway. They will not be willing to go to any lengths to overcome their problem, because they do not yet believe that the vice makes their life hopelessly unmanageable.     Now, I could say I believe you might be one of the lucky ones who can moderate, but I'd be lying. I hope, but I do not believe. Do normal gamers obsess about gaming normally? You've stopped for a great chunk of time, but is there ANYTHING in your experience that tells you that you can consistently control how long you play for after you've started? Because complete abstinence and moderation are not, as many first assume, the same skill.     But I say none of this to try to dissuade you from testing moderation, because when I was at a similar crossroads, I wouldn't have been persuaded either. It took bottoming out again for me to know for sure, so in that sense it was absolutely necessary.

When I quit games my life was a fucking mess. Here's a few highlights:    I battled depression, struggled with low self-esteem and “feeling good enough.”  I didn’t have very many friends, and the ones I did have were gamers. Not only that, but I didn’t even know how to make friends.  I lacked confidence in general, especially with women, was constantly put in the dreaded friend zone and didn’t feel attractive as a man.  I had little education, had dropped out of high school twice and never graduated, had no desire to go back or to ever go to college.  I was in and out of jobs all the time, lasted two days as a landscaper, worked as a dishwasher at Earls, lasted about a week stocking shelves at Walmart, and disappeared from my jobs at Papa Johns Pizza and Booster Juice.  Worst of all, to avoid having to get another job I deceived my parents by pretending to have a job at a restaurant and again at an internet cafe.   But what I did was I saw that as a challenge, even though my life was in a bad spot, the purpose in my life became becoming the type of person I wanted to be. It wasn't to hope for it, it was to work for it.  And over the past 6 years I've busted my ass to learn everything I can about personal development, social skills and lifestyle design, about how to be happy, how to be attractive and how to live a great life, I've read over a 60 books in the last 2 years alone, attended seminars and put in work every day to create the life I wanted.  And it's worked! I'm currently in Thailand traveling with a girl I met in Vancouver in April (we hung out 3 times before she came to travel with my for 5 weeks) and I feel happier than ever.   But it's happened over the last 6 years of me working hard on myself to become the type of person I want to be, by taking full ownership of that and not settling for anything less, PERIOD.  Here's what I would do:   Watch this TEDx talk where I share my story. Read these books ASAP: The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson, A Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor Frankl, Think And Grow Rich by Napolean Hill and Daring Greatly by Brene Brown. Quit drinking and commit to being sober for a year. This isn't for any specific reason other than: 1) It's a challenge in discipline 2) being sober will help you think more clearly and help you build more  daily momentum 3) it's a depressant and it's easy to use as a crutch 4) you want to improve your life and that happens sober   Hope that helps. You can make a ton of progress and live a truly remarkable life if you commit to doing so and work at it EVERY SINGLE DAY refusing to settle for anything less. Because you DESERVE a great life."

I am a very unusual person though I must warn you.  1 I would buy some ginger and make a tea, and have it with some ginseng extract. This will be to ground my energy and open up the meridians.  2 I would stretch my entire body for 20-30 minutes  3 I would sit down somewhere in nature and just feel and be present inside my body, processing all the emotions and sensations without labeling them 'good' or 'bad'. I would focus as much as I could on the present moment.  4 I would do a horse-stance for half an hour while underbreathing (research Dr. Buteyko and his work on breathing). My legs would probably be on fire and I would probably be dripping sweat all over the place.  5 i would take a hot/cold shower alternating hot with cold water a minute each for 6 or 7 cycles.  6 i would go to the health food store and buy only organic, whole foods, preferably raw. I would get some kind of super green powder for all kinds of nutrition.  7 I would sit down and chew each bite of my meal 50-100 times and breath slowly and deeply while doing so, focusing on the present moment.  8 I would purchase an earthing sheet or create my own so that I can lie down and sleep while grounded electrically to the earth.  9 I would decide exactly what I want in life and give up all media, television, video games, movies, and other distractions, as well as all substances like alcohol, drugs, sweets, fast food etc.  10 I would begin a concentrated and focused effort to improve my physical physique.  11 I would begin a focused effort to improve my ability to attract and seduce women  12 I would begin an intense training program using my grounding sheet at night to remove all entities and media programming as well as energetic manipulation from my etheric body.  and that's it! Guaranteed happiness probably in as little as 3 days. All you have to do really is shift your mind set to the point where you understand that its GOOD to feel BAD emotions so long as you are FEELING THEM CONSCIOUSLY without judgement or condemnation/self identification. No ""poor me I feel this emotion because of this or that"". Just feel it without labeling it and realize your true self, your true awareness is completely whole, happy, and complete in the present moment.  Live in the moment!"

School was always pretty easy for me, even taking the most difficult advanced classes, and I put almost all my extra free time into gaming.   It's great to ride that initial wave of motivation about making a big change in your life, but remember these quotes from psychologist Kelly McGonigal:   The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification—you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done.  Sometimes the mind gets so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of having actually accomplished the goal.   Taking action is the best way to bring your decisions to life, no matter how small that action is. Gregg Krech reminds us that...   Until I actually take some constructive action, I have not changed the reality of my life or the world around me at all by just deciding. It may seem like progress. It certainly feels like progress. But keep in mind that regardless of how much thought and energy went into that decision, I can change it in an instant. I can simply think, “No, I think I’ll do something else instead.” Now I’ve made two decisions, and still nothing has changed. So please be cautious about thinking of decision-making as something you did. Generally, it’s something you thought."

But, travel doesn't have to be expensive. For example, if you get to Bali you can live there comfortably for less than $800/month USD. Outside of a flight, if you managed to save up $5000 usd, you could go live in Bali for 6 months."

Fortunately, after I stopped gaming for a while, my brain returned to a more normal state, and real life is engaging and interesting again. But it took months for that change to occur.  If gaming is really the only thing you have in common with your friends, then you're most likely not going to remain friends after you stop. It's your life, you get to choose who is a part of it and who isn't. Being lonely and finding new friends sucks, but it sucks a lot less than hating yourself because you can't stop gaming."

We play games because our friends play and then when we go to quit we have to face the fact that either we need to find new friends (and we don't know how) or we will just keep playing to keep our friends.  But the good news is, there is a solution to this. And I recommend two things:   Find a way to stay friends with your current gamer friends, but without gaming. This will help you not feel the loss of your friends. Although in your case, you may want to create a bit more distance between you and them and focus on #2 more because if your friends are hardcore stoners that will lower your ambition and desire to quit. (I've smoked since I was a young teenager, been an outspoken advocate for MJ use and still believe it's not always the best thing for ambition.) Make new friends that aren't gamers.   I shared more on both of these steps in this video. Watch it and you'll have a good plan of how to move forward.

I have plenty of willpower that I have used in many cases.  After ten years of smoking I quit, like you Tom, and never went back to it in the past 15 years.  The problem I seemed to face with gaming addiction was a mental twist that would redirect my willpower.  I would be determined to stop gaming, deleting, uninstalling, unsubscribing, throwing away everything related to it.  I would make other plans and start following through on them.  But then the thought of gaming would enter my head, and maybe I had already pushed it aside several times, but it kept popping up and eventually I'd start thinking it would be okay to game again, and that this time I'd do it differently, and I'd keep it in control and stop the instant things started to look bad again.  Then suddenly my willpower was swiveled around to the opposite direction and off I'd go.  The compulsion would roar back to life and channel my willpower into countless hours of games, seemingly trying to make up for lost time.  Hopefully your experience is different Tom and your game-free month in Europe will easily set you on a new track.  But like LS said, if it doesn't work out, come back and speak up.

Don't allow that time wasting, energy draining, succubus into your life ever again.

Information technology (informationsystems) is well integrated in todays business plans.  The foundation in every business is the IT. A company cannot exist without informationsystems(computer science) in todays society Consider point one and two. You will get a job 100%. If you can make it.  Grades is just to show how good you are at learning the subjects. If you want to qualify to a master you need a C average. Aim for that. People that hire dont look at grades, but experience. Get a part time job related to your study. It will make you understand the subjects better and you will get references witch is very important when searching for a job. People want people with experience.  Computer science is all about understanding. If you see the logic you will understand. Dont feel that you need to understand everything and know every subject. People working in big firms uses google to find line of code or solutions to problems. All you need is to understand. Find a groupe of people to study with. 4 people solving a task is better than struggling alone. And it motivates you.

Obviously it is frustrating to suddenly have so much time and not knowing what to do.

Although I don't really have any best friends or usual friends that I talk with or meetup with. I have broken off with the friends that have played games because all they try to do is convince me to start playing again. But eventually they stopped caring and now they don't bug me no longer.

And I've also had that ""bear eating before going into hibernation"" feeling. Personally I think its a sign that you're addicted to video games. Even though you are able to balance life by doing work and things that are supposed to be prioritizes, what I think the most important is that it still does damage to your general mindset. I personally think that building a habit of looking or craving for more time on the computer/console is something that I wouldn't want as I continue to grow up."

It also resembles addiction, but no one can diagnose you except yourself.  Two criteria that I hear a lot are powerless and unmanageable. Are there times when you are powerless over your gaming, when you can't stop even though you want to? Do you have trouble managing any aspects of your life because of your gaming?  No one admits addiction until they are feeling some real pain in their life.

I think SG serves as a great tool to remind me not to get sucked in, add variety to free time and devote an appropriate amount of time to work and play. If this tool doesn't work for you, keep looking.. and once you find it, share it and help eachother out.   This is after all a public internet forum. There's no certificate of legitimacy to what anyone says on this entire website. r/fitness helps people and a lot of other SRs do too. People share what they think will help or what has helped them. Ask for proof if you want to be sure, and if you don't get that, you don't have to follow it. If you need real therapy for a game addiction, do that.

But we certainly can give a piece of our minds to those that require advice. This isn't the only option for everyone. There are many other options to seek advice on quitting video games. And in human nature there is bound to be people that will give harmful advice and things that are ignorant to the great idea of giving advice and support. So what I'm trying to say is that you have to deal with what bad advice and other people give and you don't always have to listen to it. That one guy that will be giving advice that is offensive should be ignored and you should look to those who give constructive advice and encouragement to you.

Generally speaking, StopGaming is pretty good at giving advice though. People who post questions know to take it all with a grain of salt. Furthermore, they can take a look at the replies. When most people are saying one thing and one guy is saying another you can generally expect the majority of folks to be on the right track. No, an argumentum ad populum is not a solid foundation but then again, neither is a random group of people you found on the internet, right? It's a general guide. One can reasonably expect that the larger group, having nothing to gain by lying, is closer to the truth. But just like any other advice you get online, you need to look into it yourself."

BUT if you get rid of both masturbation and gaming, you would have to find new ways to get your dopamine shot, and your whole life have been turned up side down. This of course leads to some people thinking everybody has a problem with both masturbation and gaming, because they themselves are this way.

StopGaming,3aecor,lisa3333,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:37:16 2015 UTC,"The weird thing about my gaming addiction is that it did EXACTLY what you describe.  It took away my interests and motivation in EVERYTHING except gaming.  Before gaming, I had goals and accomplished a ton of success in my life.  I began gaming in my late 40's as a way to relax after a hard day at work.  Within 4 years, I was gaming over 8 hours a day and it was all I was doing other than work.  I then quit my job out of the blue and gamed nonstop for years.  There is no doubt that gaming caused alot of my lack of motivation and interest in other things and then caused me a ton of depression and anxiety due to the consequences that resulted from my gaming.  I've been game free for a little over a year and first thing that happened was after about 2 weeks of not gaming I noticed I wasn't anxious and my brain felt way calmer.  It's taken a bit more time to begin to get that level of motivation, interest, and enthusiasm back that I had before gaming.  What's helped me the most was going to the online meetings and talking to other recovering gaming addicts http://cgaa.info/online-meetings/  If you are finding it a struggle to stay stopped, you don't have to try to do this alone.  Gaming addiction is a powerful one, and if it can take down someone my age, the effect it's having on young people like yourself and others who have never known who you are and what you are capable of doing without gaming is scary.  From reading your post, you are making the right decision to get it the Hell out of your life so that you can be the person you want to be!  See you in one of the meetings if you need some support with it."

Think about it this way, you chose her but she didn't choose you. Focus your efforts into finding a different girl instead of thinking about her. Do you really think out of all the people in this world SHE is the perfect one for you? You even said it yourself    It feels like everytime i talk to her i get reminded off what could've been and it makes me very sad.   There's a simple solution. Find someone else and if she really likes you she'd initiate conversations. Don't beat yourself up about it people have a natural tendency to fixate on one person who they idealize into this grand idea that's better than what the person actually is. I do it too. I have a girl just like yours but for me she's an option not THE option. I still think about her a lot but I'm always pursuing other people. Good Luck man."

Not just until tired - until it's challenging to simply walk 20 meters for the rest of the day and the next day as well. Temporarily forget about socializing, girls, being someone better, e.t.c. I know you said you're not interested in much lately - but I want you not to be concerned about not being interested in these things, at least during this ""mission"". If you do that, simple bed will be a biggest pleasure, and that nights sleep will be the sweetest you had in a while.

People who give up smoking without telling anyone are generally more successful: the ones who do tell others often get external encouragement which sometimes provokes to ""reward"" yourself (mission accomplished feeling).  ~~~~  I don't know better than you, it's just easier to give advices than to fix own problems.

There is a sandbox style Zelda game in development that I don't know how I will resist. Then those great serial games will always continue and get better.  Take that 20-30 years into the future and there will likely be gaming equipment that our current minds can't even understand. The oldest age of a poster on this sub I've seen is 38, so we are all likely to see these developments. And when people are plugging into a neural device to enter a self-created world where they are the demon-lord of some terrible post-apocalyptic wasteland, or the pony princess who has to decorate the ballroom in time for the annual spring harvest festival, there will surely suddenly be many more addicts and a much larger real-world problem. Will we then be some sort of old-guard of anti-gaming trying to save people from a self-inflicted matrix, with people like /u/camerondare being quoted like prophets?

I failed out of college twice, mostly due to a combination of substance abuse and compulsive gaming. Eventually my parents cut me off, and I was sleeping on a friend's couch without a car or a job.  That was the worst of my gaming back then, but over the following 10 years it was still a big limiting factor on the progress I made in my life.

I wasn't aware of the potential personal growth I had missed out on. I just knew that when I played games, I ignored the important stuff in my life and that bad consequences could follow.  I first quit alcohol about 16 months ago, and that led me to acknowledge that I had a problem with games too. As part of that recovery from addiction, I started doing certain things on a daily basis that I hadn't ever done in my life: meditating, praying, writing in a journal, and especially talking really openly and honestly to others about my problems.  After I started doing these new behaviors, it wasn't long before I noticed real changes in the way I looked at myself and the world. Less negativity and frustration, more acceptance and optimism. I was less fearful and anxious around other people, and it suddenly became a lot easier to muster up the courage to face situations that I was still fearful about. I was growing as a person in ways I didn't think were possible.  If there was a ""key"" to any of this I think it might be acceptance of myself, exactly as I am right now. It seems illogical, because most of my life I thought that the motivation to change myself came from not being okay with who I was. But my experience now is that it doesn't work like that. It's only once I've accepted that who I am right now is exactly who I am supposed to be right now that I can move on and actually change something in my life."

Addictions are a serious topic and there is no secret special way to ""cure"" this kind of problem instantly.   When I went to a psychologist she said ""It's like alcohol addicts.

You leaving might have given him the reality check he needs. It may not be enough though. All you can do is give him the facts. Yes, gaming addiction is real. In fact all of his behaviors you described, to include the depression and outburts. It may be his addiction talking, but that doesnt excuse him or mean you have to bear that burden.  The other thing...I was lucky. My wife stuck by me and barely complained. My own introspection made me realize I had a problem and a neglected spouse. What I wanted to say however is what she told be once I recovered. She told me that I was a better husband than I had ever been. She said it was like night and day.

I usually cook to relax and I get hyper-focused, so him helping could throw me off, but instead of persisting and making time to do it with me, he would just blow it off and say I was being super controlling and not giving directions in the kitchen (just an example). I would have loved for him to come home and start cooking without me prompting. I know I put up with a lot but I just couldn't see myself waiting anymore and dealing with the fall out.

StopGaming,3a3a3r,hansgreger,3,Wed Jun 17 20:50:57 2015 UTC,"It is important to note that psychological issues are not a prerequisite for addiction. Depression or anxiety disorders can make video game addiction (or any addiction) more likely since, like others have pointed out, gaming is an effective way to distract yourself and numb the pain and whatever negative feelings you might be having. But again, video game addiction can happen to anyone, in any circumstances.   What makes the switch flip   Getting anywhere in real life takes time and dedication. You will often have to work towards a goal without receiving any rewards along the way. Only at the very end (sometimes not at all) will someone hand you your e.g. university degree or your raise or your medal for completing a marathon.   Video games on the other hand, reward you all day every day. Modern games (to rake in more players = more cash) often implement quality of life features and mechanisms that result in the game rewarding you independent of your own success. So in a nutshell, you'll be rewarded from the comfort of your bedroom with no real risks and rewards are immediate and tangible (""virtually tangible"").   Since you mentioned the word ""switch"": psychologists are starting to abandon the former distinction between behavioral and substance addictions, since both addictions often result in the same bodily changes. The brain of an addict shows distinct structural changes that can (to a certain degree) be measured. What researchers found out is that there appears to exist an actual ""addiction switch"" (delta fos b) that keeps people in an addictive state. It leads to all sorts of changes in your brain, affecting transmitters, neurons, receptors, genes and more. This molecular switch is turned on by the constant overstimulation of the dopamin pathway (= anticipation of reward pathway).   Long story short:    what makes it stop?   Addiction is a beast. From my own experience I can tell you that it can be an overwhelmingly consuming desire to just play video games. The hottest girl in the world could be sitting on your bed naked and you'd still go for that [insert gaming activity] to get [insert arbitrary reward]. Abstinence is a good start in almost all cases. You simply need some distance between you and games to ""reset your brain"" and turn of the molecular switch. This can take weeks to months. Then you need to start filling the void with other things to do which can be hard because everything feels so boring. Imagine suggesting a new hobby to your ex-BF and he will try it and then declare ""I don't like it!"". How can you tell whether that's true? I don't know! Could be that he is still too used to games' rewards and might actually love this hobby a year from now or it really isn't his thing.  Anyhow: If he has underlying psychological issues that do not subside by quitting gaming he should seek professional help. On top of that:   Abstinence Regular exercise Sunlight Quality sleep (7 hours+) Healthy diet (meditation) (put it in parentheses because to my knowledge its effect is not as significant as e.g. exercise but it still does wonders for people ninja edit who are e.g. lacking self discipline and willpower)   These are ""no-brainers"" that we should all try to include in our lives since they greatly enhance our mental well being.

(I would probably oftentimes characterize myself as such, but that has more to do with completely unrealistic goals I have for myself. I did manage to study two full time courses at the same time last semester, and complete them both with high grades, so I guess that should say something.) Nonetheless, I feel very lost sometimes: anxious, stressed, unable to focus on anything, sad, stupid. In these moods there is nothing like going for a 20-30 minute meditation session, it really helps me back on track and fills me with joy again. I'm definately gonna go ahead and warmly recommend meditation to anyone, whether you got mental probelms, addiction or not, I think it can be a great addition in your life. I like using some tapes I found from this thing called Stoic week, they are basically done by a therapist specializing in cognitive behavioural therapy and link to the ancient greek teachings of stoicism.   EDIT: I don't mean to criticize you since you hadn't looked into it, just felt like expanding on it, maybe someone will be inspired to try meditating; and that would be enough for me."

I have so much more potential than what I projected during those years.  Your ex-partner will learn one day. Gaming can really suck you in. Personally, I feel PS4's and XBOX's are far better because you can just sit on the couch and play for a bit while engaging with others and family. Whereas, playing games on the computer is very isolated. Even then, I personally prefer going cold turkey with my track record. I cant say I miss it, although its only been a week. I have literally uninstalled everything. I used to be ripped to the bone, work out, box, play ball at a high level (AGrade and state ball) and slowly let go off that.

Slowly I'm changing my life-style tackling one addiction after the other (stopped smoking yay).  The way I see it the worse I am doing the more reason I have to waste my time away playing the game.  Also I enter that vicious circle in which I play worse than my potential because I am depressed and I can't keep my impulses in check. That leads to me hating myself even more and trying to make up for it by starting yet another game in which me, the idiot, will finally get my shit together and play the way I know I'm meant to play.  Depressed people look for proof that they are worthless and they will unknowingly orchestrate the scenarios in which they can find just that.  When I am depressed I feel bad for no reason at all. I engage in an unhealthy habit (excessive drugs, excessive gaming) because then I have something to feel bad about and that's easier to deal with than feeling bad for no reason at all."

That's not to say I didn't relapse once, I did. What helped, accidentally, was that I linked her to a website that had my match history on it.

I maybe got lucky in that I had played so much that I was looking for a reason to quit. Gaming seemed largely empty to me - I had exhausted and overworked those dopamine receptors and just felt empty inside.  Addiction is serious. If he were drinking himself stupid every night, I would hope you wouldn't blame yourself. This is no different, except the health consequences are less dire - the consequences on relationships and everything else are no weaker though.  The reason he lashed out at you with anger is because faced with accepting his addiction as a fact, he preferred to continue in denial - he wasn't ready to face that reality. His only option thus was to direct his anger toward you.  It's sad and unfortunate, but most importantly, don't blame yourself. If he can't accept he has an issue with the people closest to him trying to help him, he needs more serious (professional) help.

So it seems like he may have developed a dependence on video game playing.  So video game playing activates the reward system of the brain (just like cocaine or sex or love do, all just in slightly different ways).  It basically gives us pleasure.  But when you're addicted to something, you reward system starts activating at the anticipation of playing (or doing cocaine or smoke ) and you often feel an almost irresistible urge to play (or do cocaine or smoke) to feed that reward system and feel that pleasure.  So that would be the difference between being addicted and enjoying video games.  It sounds like he has such a strong urge to feel the satisfaction of playing League of Legends that he is incapable of playing in moderation and quickly runs back to the game after dinner."

StopGaming,3a1esx,Frigzy,9,Tue Jun 16 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"So my question to you is: What is your underlying motive to stop gaming?   Relationships: Now that I haven't gamed in years, I am mentally present and wanting to spend time with people important to me.  I love spending time with my son and no longer itch to get back to the games.  I call my family and old friends.  I have been dating and have given those relationships the time and attention they deserve.  Social: I still isolate some, but not nearly as much as I used to.  I organize social events sometimes, play frisbee, play in a band.  I am no longer so sleep-deprived that I have trouble stringing two sentences together.  I attend and lead CGAA meetings regularly, talk to other people in recovery from game addiction, and have made some great new friends.  Hobbies: Since I stopped gaming, I learned to play keyboards and joined a band that plays at dances 2-3 times per year.  I've been building a primitive lean-to shelter and identified 224 different types of wild plants on my land, 94 of which are edible.  I have a wall of pictures of a few dozen plants that I've drawn.  I've built up a karaoke collection and hosted a monthly party.  I have finished three fun programming projects and put them online for free, where they've been downloaded tens of thousands of times.  I have read a couple dozen books in the past few years.  When I was gaming, all hobbies were completely neglected, and any reading I did was on game strategy.  Work: I show up and do the work I say I will do.  I no longer game during work hours and in effect steal from my employer.  My boss is happier and I make more money.  Physical health: I work out sometimes, play ultimate frisbee, go for runs and bike rides, and mountain hiking.  My diet is vastly improved.  I get the sleep I need.  I have good energy.  Mental and emotional health: I am no longer full of self-loathing for breaking my promises to myself and others, for isolating, for lying about and hiding my gaming.  My memory is much improved.  I am no longer chronically irritable and angry from sleep deprivation and poor diet.  I no longer have anger outbursts at game players or anyone.  I am often calm and content.  I much more easily laugh with other people and joke around.  Spiritual health: I'm back into meditation.  I care about how I affect other people and I strive to be generous and loving.  I have purpose in life that fulfills me.  I cherish every moment with my son and feel grateful for freedom from game addiction.  Responsibility: I remember my commitments and follow through on them.  I take care of my hygiene and health, clean my home, and take great care of my son.  My underlying motive is to live life and enjoy all of the above, rather than self-destruct my life through the neglect, terrible decision making, and negative attitudes that plagued me in active game addiction."

But what's more likely is that I'll be happy that I tried many different things, met different people and experienced this planet to the fullest. I don't want to put all my eggs into one basket only to realize it was a horrible choice. After all, you can't turn back time.  Furthermore, I know about the structural brain changes caused by behavioral addictions. Playing video games gives you an illusion of fun when it's actually just addiction. So video games (for some of us) are actively preventing us from doing anything else. What I am trying to say is that quitting video games can in itself be a goal because only after having successfully quit them will you be able to enjoy life."
StopGaming,3a1esx,veydar_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:23:21 2015 UTC,"I think the main problem in trying to quit anything is that you are putting yourself in a situation where you cannot possibly win in a way that feels significant to you.  Even if you haven't gamed in over 100 days, but still feel the urge once in a while to game, it will cost you precious mental energy. At the same time, the 100 days will not really stick as a significant feeling of victory. The next time the urge pops up you're still there with the urge. Also, focusing on not doing something is preventing you from shifting your focus to something else completely in the long run.  On top of that, there's only a clear way for you to lose, aka when you give in and game. You will not be able to enjoy it either because it's loaded with the emotion of losing something valuable to you.     This is why it's so much better to think of your recovery as an project towards something positive and constructive. Judge your success in terms of your progression instead of your lack of relapse. You will get a lot more natural and profound fulfillment out of your progression, which will in turn motivate you and provide honest and quality reasons not to play."

I had maintained my gaming habit except now I was going out being social a lot more, so my uni performance was below mediocre. Eventually after we got together, improving myself socially has been replaced by spending time with her, and I thought that was ok, I hated going to smokey bars and mingling with drunks anyway.

I blamed my kitchen job for taking away my time to study, but when I quit it, instead of studying, I gamed more so naturally I got expelled.

One thing that changed it for me was when I failed miserably at trying to charm a girl that I was incredibly interested in. I found myself on a crossroads between trying to stay the same or changing into someone who would actually know how to interact with women.  At the time it felt like I had to choose between her or other women, which of course was not at all true, but it nevertheless felt that way. Obviously I chose her until it became obvious that other women were the only choice. In fact, my only choice really was to get better with women in general because I knew that if I ever wanted to be able to be with a girl like her, I'd have to be the best I could be. With women, career wise, health wise, with people in general, ...  From that point onwards I devoted myself to becoming the best version of me I could possibly be. At first I was motivated by her, but soon I realised I did it because I loved improving, and eventually I realised I loved myself, which was a crucial epiphany.     What I'm saying is: don't let your decisions depend on your fears. Look at your desires and be honest about them. Feel your fears that surround those desires, but act in a way that supports your desires rather than shies away from your fears.

It reminds me of autopathing, a ""quality of life"" feature in many modern asian MMORPGs that, to me, just indicates how shitty these games are. Apparently the developers are acknowledging how boring their game is so they give you an autopilot so you can ... do what exactly?   Anyhow, before my post comes across as negative or condescending, there's something I am trying to highlight: The way you describe WoW it doesn't seem to be something you really enjoy and yet you stick with it because you're afraid of   Losing friends Losing your investments (custom UI.. maybe raid gear etc.?)   First of all, gaming friends are quite often just that: gaming friends. If it's true friendship then you'll stay in contact even after having left the game behind and in any other case, what's the point? If these people are primarily interesting in x the healer, whom they need to farm stuff (as opposed to you, the person), then these relationships aren't worth sacrificing your life!   The reason why you are (just like I did) struggling with willpower is because gaming is the easiest way to ""feel good"". It offers you constant, immediate rewards that you can access from the comfort of your home (maybe even bedroom). You're not taking any risks, you can always jump in and out, stay anonymous or share your feelings and it requires no perseverance whatsoever. Even if you fail at a certain encounter or can't climb the PvP ladder you're still getting more gold, more drops, more x.   Real life doesn't work like that. You can go running 20 times and yet no one will congratulate you, you might not look any different and there's no level up and no monetary reward.  Long story short: how do you change this? Start by not playing any video games for [time period of your choice]. Get enough quality sleep (7h+, cool and quiet, like AMD), eat healthy, go outside and get regular exercise (swimming, running, cycling?). Start meditating for 5 mintues every day (meditating is not saying ""oooomm"" while sipping Chai Latté though). These activities are not meant to replace games but they should be your new ""baseline"". All of these things will strenghten your willpower (=self discipline) and lead to a healthier state of mind (science backs this up). Ultimately, this change of general well being will be important in tackling new challenges and new hobbies. What these are? No idea, we're all different. For me it's coding, sports and learning a new language. For someone else it might be friends, gardening and traveling.  Be prepared for a long and arduous journey though. Like I said, real life rewards are ... well, they're pretty poor when compared to MMORPGs. But ultimately, in MMORPGs you're improving your avatar, not yourself. Not that everyone needs to improve, but the moment the servers are wiped, all of it is gone (save for some very few, very minor skills and experiences that will benefit you in the long run). So in any case it's way better to improve your actual, real life self, then a bunch of pixels.  Hope this helps, feel free to ask!"

StopGaming,3a11an,Swizzdoc,2,Tue Jun 16 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"Based on your short description here, it sounds like the only solution is for you to quit completely. Fortunately, there is a program of action that you can follow to quit successfully. Many people, who were in the exact same situation as you, have stopped playing games completely, so you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Just do what they did.  If you feel like you don't have the willpower, then don't use willpower to quit. Willpower is a limited resource, and if you rely on it then one day it will run out and you will play again. So, how do you quit without willpower?   Only quit for today. Quitting for one day is a much smaller commitment than imagining the rest of your life without games. If you make it through the day, you're a success. You can worry about tomorrow when it comes. Connect with other gaming addicts through this forum and CGAA meetings. Sharing your story with others and hearing their experience is easily the most powerful antidote to that craving for games. Meditate and write in a journal. Habits of self-reflection will help you keep your personal commitments at the top of your mind, so you're less likely to regress to your old ways of thinking."

Let's think about it, what do you do in this game? -you run around most of the time, it's like a virtual walking simulator -the game makes you wait when you die. -you collect meaningless crap in this game -you hit flashy icons to kill enemies. Killing enemies doesn't even require much skill. -you follow a skinner box collecting worthless items that will become useless once the next patch or expansion is released -etc.  Now picture yourself on your deathbed.

StopGaming,3a09oe,Bigblueduck,2,Tue Jun 16 05:32:10 2015 UTC,"You are in the process of step 1: Getting rid of your vices, which appear to be (or have been) gaming and weed. Congratulations on that! Don't say you haven't achieved anything because you are achieving something right now!  As you have correctly figured out though, you're currently at a loss what to do with your time. It's completely normal. Unfortunately, you can't just give up gaming and magically turn into a better person, it merely gives you the time and piece of mind to devote your energy to something other than video games.  I suggest to simply try out a couple of things to raise your overall mood. Getting regular exercise, especially endurance workouts that happen outdoors, is extremely beneficial. You might not like it (I hate running) but after a weeks of perservering you will feel a lot better about yourself.  Meditation is another thing that generally strengthens your willpower and acts like an antidepressant. Just like you with exercise, continuitiy is key. There's no point in bingeing on these things and then stopping them after a week.  Eat healthy, no junk food, try to consume as little alcohol as possible, maybe even cook your own food.   Most importantly though, get quality sleep. Seven hours should be the minimum. Yes, there may exist people who are perfectly fine with less than that, but chances that you are among them are extremely slim. Quality sleep means not induced by alcohol or drugs, quiet and cool environment and like I said 7h+.   This should be the 'baseline' from now on. On top of that, go out and look for hobbies, whatever they are. But don't overdo it, following these rules will be hard enough on its own. Plus, you'll need a job sooner or later to afford whatever lifestyle you fathom. From my own experience I can tell you that a 40h work week isn't really compatible with having too many hobbies.  Hope this helps!"

StopGaming,3a09oe,sidselh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:17:33 2015 UTC,"I relate to almost everything you wrote here. I see myself in your story.  I quit alcohol and drugs about 16 months ago, and quit games 7 months ago. I go to A.A. meetings for my alcohol/drug addiction, and I post on this forum for my gaming addiction.  I knew I needed to get sober when I did, but I also had this feeling inside that there was something more to it. I had always felt this discontent and restlessness about my life, long before I ever drank or smoked weed. It always felt like I should be doing something bigger, and I had no idea what it was or how I was going to get there.  That feeling has changed recently. I've started a number of daily habits that allow me time for self-reflection: meditation, journaling, and regularly talking to others on a deep, personal level. And the effect of all this is that I am cultivating an inner satisfaction with life, something that I seem to carry with me regardless of what is happening around me.  I used to think that outward success in life would bring inner happiness. That's how you motivate yourself, right? If you're unhappy with your life, that motivates you to change. At least, that's how I thought the world worked. But if you flip that script, if you accept that first you must cultivate an inner happiness that exists independently of the circumstances in your life, then everything changes. It will suddenly feel like good things are just happening to you, with no extra effort on your part. You are no longer grinding and pulling to try to get good things out of life. You do things because you want to do them, not because you're trying to manipulate the world to produce some desired result.  It takes time and a daily commitment to change. But it's easily possible to completely change your mindset in a year. And you will feel the payoff for the rest of your life. All you have to do is start now."
StopGaming,3a09oe,jotakami,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:21:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your story, I can relate to so much of what you said. I'm sorry you're going through such a tough time.     I spent the ages of 12-26 escaping from reality using videogames, alcohol, and drugs. I did not like myself, and did not see any reason why others would either. Videogames were a way to avoid dealing with others, while alcohol and drugs were a way of altering how I saw the world so that dealing with others would become bearable.      At one point I was mixing drinking, stimulants, and prescription anxiety medication with 18-hour videogame sessions (FO3 and FONV were my poison at the time), and this continued for several months. The curtains were perpetually drawn, empty pizza boxes and dirty dishes littered the floor, and my garbage cans overflowed into their surroundings. I refused contact with friends and family, and the mere thought of talking to strangers was enough to make me kill a six-pack and 3 Xanaxes. I felt so hopeless that even going to the grocery store seemed insurmountable--not because it was far, it was literally 2 minutes away, but because I was terrified by the prospect of speaking to a cashier. I would pace the apartment talking to myself, rehearsing what I'd say at the checkout counter. ""Hey how you doin'. Hey how you doin'. Have a good one. Have a good one. Hey how you doin'.""      The actual interaction would then usually go something like:      [in a barely audible mumble] ""Hey, um, how are you-""    ""Twenty-two fifty.""    ""Oh, ok, uh...""    [hands over money, gets change]    [clears throat] ""Have a good-""    ""Next customer please.""     I would then walk briskly with my head down to my apartment and feel a momentary relief when I bolted the door, followed immediately by a panicked need to jump back into the game as soon as I finished dealing with ""annoyances"" like going to the bathroom and putting groceries in the fridge (which I sometimes forgot to do).     Looking back at that period of my life, I can't believe how far I've come. I'm 28 now, and though I definitely got a late start compared to my peers, I'm the happiest I've ever been. I have a job, friends, I'm the healthiest I've ever been (5'11 and at a lean 162 lbs, I deadlift 400lbs--not saying that's the only definition of health, but I was a skinny-fat 140lbs before so it's a tremendous change for me), and most importantly, I have hope for the future. I'm saving up money so that by next August I can move to Japan to learn Japanese and work. I know it's dorky, but I've been in love with Japanese animation since childhood and life's too short to waste on not chasing dreams. (Dreams which I didn't know I had, or could even develop, until I had spent enough time sober and away from games).     I guess this is a roundabout way of saying, it gets better. People have already given good advice in this thread, especially with regard to meetings. They were the turning point in my recovery. I would just add, you don't have to tackle all these things at once--give yourself maybe a month or so to tackle each good habit you're building (that's still 12 a year!). Once a habit feels ""set"", move on to the next. That way you won't feel overwhelmed and give up.     Good luck to you, friend."

I gained the ability to enjoy things other than gaming again, which was really helpful, and I've also gained the ability to be present (most of the time) for the people around me.  Just about the only thing I did right when I was working on giving up gaming was that I never gave up.  I kept going back, realizing I didn't really want to keep living that way, and then returning to my recovery fellowship and asking for help.  It wasn't pretty, but it worked out far better than giving up on the whole idea would have.  Perhaps try Meetup as a way to get some friends in the area?"

My gaming addiction really took off when I started playing WoW, and fast forward a few years I ended up withdrawing from college with a few classes left because I was failing, and I spent a full year and a half consumed by a free to play MMO.  Easily playing 16+ hours a day, hardcore raiding, etc.  I let all my relationships crumble around me, and really only gave a crap about those stupid pixels on my computer.  I would get angry at anyone who would try to get between me and my addiction.  It was not pretty.  I have finally decided that enough is enough.  I know there is so much more to life, and I want so much more out of this life.  I see my friends graduating and moving on to bigger and better things, and I saw that I was still stuck spinning my wheels and going nowhere in life, which is when I started seeking how to quit gaming.  And I think that is a huge step for both of us.  I want to congratulate you on finding this sub.  It is awesome that you recognize your addiction and want to get past it.  So congratulations on that :). Now as far as the next steps, it isn't going to be easy.  I would recommend looking up Cameron Adair's article on How to Quit Gaming FOREVER.  It really resonated with me, and maybe it will have the same effect on you.  Basically though, the next step is to quit everything cold turkey.  Delete your accounts, sell your games, sell your consoles, sell or cripple your gaming pc, anything and everything related to gaming you have to get out of your life.  I know it sucks, and I am still struggling through it having done it a little over a week ago.  You and I both know it is worth it in the end though.  Another suggestions is to get active in this subreddit, and also look into some CGAA meetings where you can get awesome advice from people who have gone through what we are going through.

Now, at age 31, I just graduated with a master's degree, and accepted a job offer where I will make more money than most of my friends who followed the ""normal"" path in life.  But anyways, the first step is to stop playing games. Reality can't compare to games, and as long as you are hooking your brain up to the game, even if only occasionally, then everything else in life will seem pointless or boring or too difficult. But the experience of countless former gamers has shown that when you remove the games, after a certain period of time then your brain returns to a more normal state. The crazy thoughts and despair that you have right now will eventually fade away. Trust that this will happen.  Now, how do you stop? Imagining a lifetime without games was really daunting for me. I had used them to escape from life for so long that I was terrified of living without that escape hatch. What helped for me was to take it one day at a time. Each day, my only concern was to not pick up a game for that day. If I made it to the end of the day without gaming, that day was a success no matter what else happened. Worrying about the future and what else you should be doing will do nothing for you. The future will come when it comes, and you can deal with it then."

Gaming, especially MMORPGS, means that you are constantly chasing a reward (gear, level, AP, ladder, raid). Anticipation of a reward activates certain pathways in your brain (= dopamine). Overstimulation of these pathways eventually results in actual, visible changes in your brain (google: delta fosb), which ultimately trap you in an additive state.   This explains why it is so vital (for some) to start with a complete, 100%, no questions asked, abstinence period. Your brain needs to adapt to the real life again which tends to be slow, tedious and often devoid of tanglible rewards.   MMORPGs (I speak from experience) are the devil when it comes to making everything else seem horribly boring."

I don't moderate and track my hours because that's implying I can't stop myself, and I can. If I look at the time and I've been playing for over an hour, I'll take a break no matter what I'm doing because its just a game.

Whether or not you can do something in between those is a question to which I don't know the answer.

StopGaming,39yckz,LearningSerenity,4,Mon Jun 15 22:08:15 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are that there is always going to be something new and exciting coming out in the gaming world.  I mean, it's their job..  release things that get people so excited that they can't resist giving them their time, money and effort.  I don't blame the gaming industry for doing their job, and for the people that can play in moderation and not have an issue then I'm sure they don't mind either.  Now I can't speak for everyone, but I feel that most people that are here on this sub are here because they can't resist their urges.  All it takes is a little slip up, and we are back to square one again, binge-ing on gaming and feeding our addiction.  Also, I feel that most people on this sub are here because they realize that there is more to life, and they are tired of wasting their time with games.  We want to find our passion in life, and pursue it to our fullest potential.  We have also realized that gaming has been holding us back from that, which is why we are here trying to take these step to put it behind us.  I totally understand wanting to play in moderation, and having a ton of friends that we make through gaming.  There is a reason that it is so damn addicting though.  Unfortunately, I have had to reassess my ""friends"".  A lot of them don't understand my addiction, and try to make me feel like crap for not joining them.  And you know what?  People come and go in our lives, and not everyone is meant to stay.  A certain part of me has had to come to terms with this, and realize that what I had with certain people in the past is just that- in the past.  I have made a decision to move on with my life, and those who aren't on board with my decision I have had to slowly choose myself over that relationship with them.  And the good news is, with 7+ billion people on this planet, there are plenty of other people out there.  There are even some people out there that are interested in the same things I am interested in, and who want to live life to the fullest instead of dulling their brain on video games all day.  I may not have found them quite yet, but I know they are out there.  All I have to do is commit myself to putting myself out there to find them.  In summary, I would basically say that it isn't worth it.  Maybe you can moderate, maybe you can't.  Honestly though, why would you even want to risk trying?  There are so many other things to do in this world.  There is bound to be something out there that grips a hold of you as strong, if not stronger, than gaming.  All you would be doing by spending time on something that you know is a time suck and a waste, and it would just be holding you back from spending that time trying to discover what you are meant to do here on Earth while you still have time.  If you want to waste that time, then obviously no one is going to stop you.  This decision is completely up to you, and you just have to decide what you want out of life.  If I were you, I would sell the Xbox, 100% commit yourself to getting rid of video games from your life, and going out and pursuing that which really pulls you in.  If you are able to do that, then the friends (and possibly even more) will come with that.  I totally understand where you are coming from, but make sure you are completely thinking this decision through before you do anything that might set you back.  Stay strong, friend, and I hope all is well with you!"

That being said, I had quite a bit of that sort of logical disconnect in my thinking when I was first getting off of games, and although it still shows up sometimes, it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be.

My inability to quit playing games was pushing me toward suicidal thinking on a pretty regular basis, and if not for the help of my fellow recovering addicts, I'm sure that I eventually would have tried it, and quite possibly ""succeeded"".  It's been a bit since my last game, and it's relatively unusual for me to find myself wanting to play one.  The thoughts do come up from time to time though, and then I remember where I went the last time I started gaming, and it helps put things into perspective.

No counselor would ever tell you to hang on to your trusty ol crackpipe.  I'm a strong believer in making a conscience decision to not engage in an activity/substance instead of just making it difficult to get to but that's a step for later on. At the beginning, people need to have those things well out of reach. A few months in, it's a good idea to have the ability to play games right there in your room and simply choose not to play.

I'm pretty new here, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I'll share what's worked for me so far:   For starters I think the best thing you can do is stop cold turkey. Don't try to just limit yourself, you need to stop all together.  If you're anything like me, you'll need to completely eliminate the option of playing games. I played a ton of League, Hearthstone and SSBM. To eliminate these I uninstalled them from my computer and gave away my controller. From here I have the option to return to my games in moderation if I reach my goal (365 days)  As a fail safe, should I suffer withdrawal I have to go a step further which means deleting my accounts. If you're anything like me, you've probably invested a huge amount of time and money into LoL, so the idea of erasing your account is probably terrifying. Which is good! That can keep you motivated to not go back to it! Another thing I found really important is to make sure you either Un-Sub from all your gaming related subs or create a new account. It's easy to piss away hours just reading about the games you play even when you aren't playing them. This one's more of a recommendation than a requirement, it's something I struggled with in the past.  Finally you'll need to fill a whole bunch of extra time you have now! Here you can find Cam's list of hobbies that you can use to fill your time, but you might already have some things in mind! For me I went back to practicing music, started working out and began to be more pro active with my social life.    Hopefully this is somewhat helpful!

I just looked around my room one afternoon after another all-nighter of gaming into the day and had called in sick to work again and saw all the mess around me. I read some of my old journals I'd write to myself. All the promises to myself and the ""goals"" I had. Then I'd read more recent entries...with very similar things being written down.

When you remove compulsive gaming from your life, it's truly amazing what you can find out about yourself. Things you thought were core parts of your personality simply fall away, and you seem to gain abilities that you never thought you had. This has been my experience as well.  I would add that these incredible changes don't just happen by quitting games. This is the result of following a program of recovery with others who have done this before you and can show you the way."

Referencing your paragraph on being assertive: I am coming around to this way of thinking just recently. Beforehand, I was bending over backwards when any disagreements arose or when workloads were divvied up; I avoided confrontation. I am learning that being assertive is a sign that I have self worth and respect and love for myself; I am very intelligent and my opinion matters and I matter.   Related to the old pattern in my life: it's great to be giving and compromise so that everyone is included and respected (assuming 3rd parties deserve some measure of respect); but it isn't okay to continually see your opinions, necessities and desires as inferior.  Thanks, again!"
StopGaming,39rlnb,carthidare,2,Sun Jun 14 02:00:17 2015 UTC,"A significant part of addiction is its ability to numb pain, and that was one of the main functions of self-injury for me. I think self-injury can be for other reasons as well, but regulating emotions is a big one. For me, I don't have drug or alcohol addiction, but I've struggled for a long time with self-injury before my gaming got out of control. And I experienced some of the same feelings of being control with both. Out of control self injury does tend to draw a bit more attention (and cause things like ending up in the hospital psych unit), but I don't think they're far removed. When I struggle with gaming cravings, they often flip back and forth with self injury urges depending what's triggering me.  With addiction, people persist in it long after their health, career, relationships, etc are falling apart around them. Gaming is no different than other addictions in that respect. Here are some things common to gaming addicts. I also found this talk on the disease model of addiction to be really helpful for explaining how addiction works and why we make seemingly poor decisions because of it."

I couldn't talk to women, I had no motivation in school, but when I was gaming I was content. Even a small amount of gaming was enough to have this effect on me, as I was always looking forward to my next chance to play instead of confronting the reality in front of me.  For me the only way to break out of that pattern of behavior was to quit games completely. It may seem strange that gaming behavior is connected to how you feel about other parts of your life, but games really have a powerful effect on the brain, similar to drugs. It's hard to know what a normal, baseline state of mind is for you unless you remove the games for at least a few months."

""For me, it just sounds like you are trying to avoid dealing with your problems.""  Just wanted to know what people who see themselves with a gaming problem think about quitting cold turkey or if they used another method. It's like I know I have a problem with believing in myself.

It sounds like you know the parts of yourself you want to fix, or improve upon but kind of using ""it takes time"" to justify playing games. Basically, any time you spend gaming you are not spending it to challenge yourself or take risks, to learn and improve. I've had to address a lot of things about myself I didn't want to, in recovery, and I still am. I'm still learning how to improve and build/transform myself into who I want to be.

For some people, trying to ween down with smoking never works for similar reasons.   With this addiction, I don't really call it ""cold turkey"". It's not like I'm a massive alcoholic who, when suddenly stopping all consumption, could actually put their life and health at risk. Yes, withdrawals suck.

Many people, including myself find watching any gaming related content extremely priming to restarting gaming. In fact, it was a random youtube person playing a game that I thought I would love that broke my back and dragged me back into gaming again.   So with that aside to answer you questions:   Watching the game that you are addicted to may be possible for your personality, but for mine it's like opening and smelling a beer while trying to quit alcohol. Maybe avoiding watching your game of preference, and watching other gaming channels may be a lessor evil? Plenty of people can and do watch gaming channels to try to slowly pull themselves out of gaming. BUT it's difficult to gauge how many are successful and how many are giving in to that gaming temptation and feeding their problem.  To be honest, if you feel it would help, then give it a try. If you fail and start gaming again, you can always use it as an important lesson on what not to do next time. However, if this coping mechanism is more of an 'urge'; I'd warn you away from it. Take it from my experience, urges are often your brain disguising a trigger to get back into gaming."

I would advise against it if you're struggling to keep yourself away from games and generally have a known history of relapsing, because one way or another you will eventually fall victim and you will reinstall the game; and if not, that time wasted on watching streams is equivalent to the time you would spend on gaming anyway.

I had almost 4 months of significant depression and persistently obsessing about gaming since I first quit (a few relapses in between, so my counter is only at 10 wks), and the only way I've gotten this far was by having other people to reach out to who understood what I was going through. Last night I had particularly bad cravings. I'm not sure exactly what got me through it, but I know it was some mixture of the connection with other people who've been where I am, knowing that there were people who cared how I was doing, and the things I've learned from them. Anyways, for me that's come from CGAA (and from counseling as well), but it doesn't really matter where it comes from as much as that it's there.

I have wasted entire days (I work evenings) sitting in front of a monitor and getting worked up because someone I don't know half a country away just wasted forty minutes of my life because they went Maokai top against a Tryndamere.

I would compare League of Legends to some hardcore drug to be honest.  The day after I quit, I saw the new announcements for reworks, balance changes and it was the start of LCS again.

League is huge right now but down the road when for whatever reason Riot cannot survive, the game will shut down and hours poured in, rankings, etc. none of that will matter.

I would go long periods without playing much, if at all, and then just destroy an entire weekend with 20+ hours in two days. I failed out of college twice, mostly due to gaming.  Something that might help is acknowledging that the game affects you far beyond the hours that you put into it. Playing video games, especially over long periods of time, alters your brain in decidedly negative ways. So it's not just that you lose the hours that you could have spent doing more worthwhile activities, but you're actually impairing your ability to focus and find enjoyment in those other activities as well.  And you're right, that voice in your head will always be waiting to come up with reasons to convince you that games aren't so bad, and a lot of fun. Your willpower alone will not save you from the voice, because it knows when your willpower is down. The best strategy to be prepared for that moment is to build habits of staying connected to people in this forum or at CGAA meetings."

Doesn't necessarily facilitate wanting to quit though, just makes everything more frustrating.  Looked down upon? Yes and no. No, because like /u/nenanen also mentioned, this is not something I talk about. I know it's shameful and that people aren't supposed to play like I do. Yes, because if it does come up or I admit it to a loved one or gf, there is an immediate inability to associate. They get this kind of quizzical look on their face like I'm addicted to watching re-runs of Barney or Sesame Street.  Affect your adult life? Absolutely. So many things I'm supposed to be doing that I have put off. So many dreams I had for myself that I placated. I have lost track of most of my ambition and it is so hard to get back. But not being taken seriously? That's not a problem, because I don't have to tell people that I'm hooked on video games and I come off as quite professional.  I work with kids and we talk about geek culture, because that is who can associate with this stuff. When they ask me about what games I'm playing now, I have to tell them that I don't game anymore and they have an instant inability to understand that concept just as adults were unable to understand that I still gamed."

StopGaming,39gatz,ChowMeinBastard,3,Thu Jun 11 18:14:02 2015 UTC,"is there such thing as growing out of gaming?   What's ""old""?  I'm 34, I definitely never ""grew out"" of wanting to play games.  I do think that as I got more and more responsibilities the time pressure gaming put on my life became greater and greater, eventually resulting in quitting.   does it affect your adult life in anyway such as not being taken seriously?   A little bit.  It's certainly not the kind of thing you want to bring up at a dinner party with a lot of sucessful people.  Anything other than extremely moderate gaming is looked down upon in most (but not all) adult circles.   To be honest though, being a ""gaming addict who doesn't play at all"" is even more awkward than playing games. So it's not like quitting was a big help in this regard, though it did give me time to develop more interesting hobbies."

StopGaming,39dqff,Scott3611,2,Thu Jun 11 05:58:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Actually, yeah, there's some game-related behavior that I'm still trying to shake off.  Mainly, ""checking things"" and ""ganking"".  Let me explain.  When I played games, I made a habit of looking at different screens often.  For example, in WoW, I was obsessive with my equipment, inventory, achievements, chats, score screens, etc.  I did the same in other games.  Tiny windows would just constantly appear and disappear because I'm always looking at things, checking the status, making sure nothing's wrong or admiring the things I've done right.  Now, outside of games, I have a really bad habit of checking social media, texts, and email, refreshing it often.  A few minutes here, a second or two there, but it all adds up to hours in the end.  It's just an entire waste of time.  The other problem is also social-media-related.  I used to have a really high karma Reddit account but I totally got hooked to the karma system.  Wasting so much time trying to score karma and feeling like complete garbage when no karma came.  This also applied to social media.  Whenever I got a +1, fave, like, thumbs up, whatever, I noticed that I received the same rush that I did when I ganked/killed people in games.  The first few kills/points feel fantastic, the hundredth/thousandth kill/point is blasé, and it always felt bad whenever I got negative points.  So I try to stay off Reddit unless I'm having trouble with some fitness problem or I'm looking for a recipe, things like that.  I'd delete my social media accounts but I kinda need it for personal/professional ties.  I just gotta limit myself and quit wasting so much time on them.  It's interesting that both of those problems are about social media.  I haven't read the text yet but the title of this post is pretty jarring: http://redd.it/399t4k  tl;dr I still waste a lot of time on social media.  I feel like it's based on the same habits I picked up from games."

StopGaming,39dqff,Note2Self_NameNeeded,3,Thu Jun 11 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'm very curious why you stopped wanting to get into the game industry, and what you are pursuing now?"
StopGaming,39dqff,TotesMessenger,3,Thu Jun 11 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"I can try to nutshell it for you.  First, I had a bad experience with the hiring manager at my school.  She basically ignored me for several years over nothing.  (I think it's because she called for a meeting when school was over and I didn't attend because I was depressed.  She took it personally.  EDIT - I kind of remember that day.  I spent most of the day lying in bed and the rest of it playing some game.  I may have left my room once or twice to use the bathroom.)  Afterwards, I tried to re-establish our connection but she wouldn't even give me the time of day.  Years later, when I lived back with my mom, the hiring manager was ignoring my emails and telephone calls (or answering them with one-sentence or one-word replies), so I had to attempt to enter the game industry solo.  Now, what I should've done was hit up each and every classmate I had, annoy the heck out of each of my professors, asking for inside info, and pushing for them to get their boss/friends to hire me.  You've really gotta hustle if you want this kind of job.  Aside from my personal struggles, there's just a lot of competition (both in and outside the US, both newbies and veterans), the companies are not paying well for entry level (unless you're a programmer), many companies force death marches, studios have been known to collapse randomly, some companies are really sneaky with their contracts.  Here's some quick stories about contracts.  One friend did contract work at BioWare for a few years but his contract only lasted a couple of months.  When his contract was up, he couldn't get work from BioWare until after a year since his last contract (or something along those lines).  They did this to cheap out on benefits.  He's not a full time employee so he doesn't qualify for benefits and the company can easily grab another contract worker to replace him.  He did this for years.  Each time his contract was up, he had no income and desperately applied to other places.  Always spending his time doing ""design tests"" (basically, working for free) and not getting any callbacks while loans and bills stacked up.  Another story!  Another friend of mine was working at Gearbox.  In her off-time, (I believe while she was at her apartment, using her own computer and software) she made some items for a contest.  She won the contest, her items got placed into that other game, and she received a good amount of money for her creation, enough to pay off her loans.  ZeniMax (I think) stepped in and tried to take her money.  Their lawyers were shoving her contract back in her face.  ""You were working for us when you made those items so those items belong to us.""  I never asked her how it ended but I know it was a huge headache for her.  The game industry is just unstable and in a disgusting condition.  Very few select people from my class are game dev rockstars.  Everyone else is unhappy, struggling, and/or getting pingponged from city to city.  It's all very stressful.  I'm also turned off with the elitism in game dev.  They say it's a small and friendly industry but I haven't encountered it yet.  I've attended several GDCs, and with my mediocre portfolio and no experience, people would treat me like I'm second class or straight up ignore me in mid conversation.  I've been to countless art workshops and art events.  Sure, there's a lot of jerks in the art world but I've never been treated this coldly before. (EDIT - I just remembered a couple of times I've been ignored or treated like garbage in the art world.  But I've gotten way more love from artists than game developers.  The arrogance feels more prevalent in the game industry.  To me, anyways.)  I remember I tried to talk to a hiring manager at Epic Games once.  When I approached, they were friendly and shining and smiling.  Then they asked, ""Do you have an appointment?""  I barely said no and the door was literally slammed in my face.  Very similar experiences with other industry professionals at GDC, afterparties, and other events.  If I were to ever enter the game industry, it would be independent/indie work.  Teaming up with old classmates for a small project or something like that.  I'm currently pursuing illustration right now which has its own set of problems.  But honestly, I entered the game industry because I wanted to paint ""concept art"".  Then I realized the ""concept art"" I really enjoy is just illustration.  I just want to paint pretty pictures."

I feel like we are against the same things that religions are against because religious people generally want to focus on God and not much else. This is because if you're obsessed with something else like sex or porn or alcohol or whatever you won't be sufficiently ascetic to pursue spirituality. If on the other hand you live a really boring life then religion is more likely to be significant for you.  The focus in this sub tends to be a bit different though. We tend to think that life can be more fulfilling and enjoyable if we abstain from certain compulsions that we have a hard time managing. So we shouldn't advocate for people to stop playing games if games aren't a problem for them. Although the means tend to overlap, the ends - enjoying life more and doing more of what you want to do - are different but not mutually exclusive from the spiritual realization goal."

StopGaming,39e8na,wellAlbidarned,5,Thu Jun 11 06:27:36 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  Some of the most beautiful games I have seen have been some of the more simplistic games (such as Portal and Journey, and I also want to add in Limbo to those two, among many others), and these games I have been able to play, they take me out of my own head for a little while, I appreciate the beauty of the game and the story, and once I complete the game I feel like I have truly experienced something (almost like watching a movie).  I don't feel addicted to these games, or spend hours trying to perfect them.  I can just appreciate them for what they are- pieces of art.  On the other hand, the games I have become addicted to have been full of flashy magic and heavy grinding and required hours upon hours of commitment in order to be decent at them.  In the end, there never is an ""end"" to these games.  Sure, they may look pretty and all that, but it kind of reminds me of the One-Armed Bandits in casinos (the slot machines), in that there is this promise of greatness, and there are all these flashing lights and pretty sounds that keep you entranced for hours upon end, and very rarely some people can become winners (say, they become ""pro"", get sponsored, start making tons of money, etc.), but for the 99.999% of all people playing these games, at the end of the day you have just wasted a lot of time, effort, and money and you ended up getting didly-squat for it.  So in summary, yes, I agree that some games can be treated as pieces of art and be appreciated as such.  For the most part, these games don't necessarily have an addicting quality either (at least for me, I can't speak for everyone).  Other games are much more selfish almost in wanting you to waste your time, money and effort on them regardless of the impact on you.  I think it is a shame, but hopefully I am able to put those kinds of games behind me.  Thanks for the interesting thought.  Hope all is well with you, friend!"

It's not untrue, but life is much bigger and more complex than simply filling time with an assortment of actions. It's easy to rationalize ""Oh, I'll just spend one hour a day on gaming"" when you're looking at just filling time. But the actions you take can have impacts that extend far beyond the simple time commitment you give them.  Gaming changed my mood, it affected the thoughts that passed through my head, and it changed the way my brain functioned.  Not just when I was playing, but for my entire life. So I would caution that even if you can keep your gaming to a ""reasonable"" amount of time, you may be underestimating how it affects your life as a whole."

In terms of the excitement of competition, I completely agree that I still get that itch.  Gaming was a way for me to get a sense of relief for that competitive edge that I have always had, and now that I don't have that I have found a need to fulfill it elsewhere.  Luckily for me, I have played soccer since I was 4, and there are lots of indoor soccer fields around my area that constantly have leagues going on and are looking for people.  That for me has been helpful for me to relieve some of the competitive ""pressure"" that I have building up inside of me.  On one hand I have found that to be beneficial, and it also gets me off my ass and gets me some exercise.  On the other hand, you don't want to get too competitive to the point of being angry after every game, no matter win or lose, because you expect more from yourself than you are physically able to do.  I have had that problem, and I am still trying to learn that I am not in the physical shape that I used to be in high school when I practiced 3x a week and had 1-2 soccer games each weekend, on top of wrestling and generally being way more active than I have been recently when I became consumed by my gaming addiction.  So my caution to you is to keep that in mind if you are looking for something competitive.  The other suggestion I have is to look into a volleyball league.  There are quite a few of them around where I am, and I have even seen some groups on meetup for pick up volleyball games.  I am not much of a volleyball player, but I am going to join this league more for the purpose of getting to meet new people and being more active, as well as getting out of the house on the weekend so I am away from the temptation of gaming.  Pretty much anything to get me out of the house is a positive at this point.  Finally, I have also found that I really enjoy racquetball.  I joined a gym that has racquetball courts, and you can pick up pretty cheap rackets from Target or Wal-Mart or something.  If you get a buddy or two or three, it is a fun sport to get some exercise while also getting a little competition in.  All in all, there are lots of sports out there and ways to fulfill that desire for competition.  I know that there are some softball leagues and such, and you can always look into your local sports organization for a recreational league to join.  It typically costs some money, but I believe it is money well spent.  I guess just look into whatever interests you, and get out there and commit yourself to something.  It'll get you out of the house, socializing around people, exercising, and you'll be able to get that excitement of competition that you previously filled with gaming filled elsewhere so you aren't tempted to go back to gaming as much.  Once again, congratulations on battling your addiction, I think it is really awesome of you :)  I hope all is well with you, friend!"
StopGaming,39bsf9,zbud,2,Thu Jun 11 03:39:09 2015 UTC,"In terms of competition adrenaline rushes; I suppose you could try in person timed chess; I usually found 15 min/person was pretty good to put you on your toes somewhat and so it doesn't get to be a snooze fest. There always seems to be more on the line in person as well.  Bouldering is a good source of adrenaline yet you don't have to get high basically like gym climbing. As opposed to doing serious rock climbing outdoors; scrambling on boulders is pretty good fun too.  Fishing when the fish are plentiful is pretty awesome as well. I went on a fishing trip to some seriously remote lake in Canada; I was there for a week and a half and only saw 4 or 5 strangers the whole time and we fished nearly every day. Meanwhile I must've caught something like 10-12 fish a day often 18"" on average. The largest was about 28"". We also fed ourselves with the walleye we caught maybe a 1/4 of the meals consisted of walleye.  Hiking and camping trips are pretty bad ass. My pal and his GF and I hiked up a small mountain; it was the best camping I'd ever done. Unparalleled camping spot."

It's kind of a symptom of long-term gaming... your brain literally changes due to the game.  Finding another adrenaline-inducing activity may feel pretty good in the short term, but for long-term results, and by that I mean returning your brain to a more natural level of functioning, it's probably best to avoid that. It is by acknowledging that craving for adrenaline, and not taking action on it, that you will start returning your brain to its normal state.  If you want to make that process move a little faster, try meditating and writing in a journal. It works wonders."

If that were the case, then a $1,000 investment should be paying you dividends by now. Just take your fancy stuff to market, sell it and get that car. Or, is the truth that your huge investment has no real world value at all, and that white whale $5,000 item is  just a dangling carrot that you keep chasing?  If you had invested that $1,000 in a real world item, like a hobby or skill, or even trading cards, you would have something that money could be made from.

Everyone who posts in this forum ""enjoys"" playing games, perhaps a bit too much. But the reason we choose to quit is because the consequences our gaming has on the rest of our lives.  Right now, you're experiencing a consequence of your gaming that distresses you. It's easy to think ""Oh, gaming isn't the issue, it's the unnecessary crap that I buy in-game that's affecting me."" But stop for a moment, and consider that these two things are inseparable. If you find that you're unable to avoid this particular negative consequence of gaming, you may find that there are other negative consequences in the future that you are also unable to avoid. Some of us have failed out of school, lost jobs, or gotten divorced because of gaming.  Will you run into these consequences one day? I have no idea, and no one else does either. But it's worth taking the time and effort to look critically at your own gaming habits, and decide if this behavior is something you want to keep in your life."

It's one of the most miserable feelings. I was all too often the self-conscious outsider. Sometimes I was the butt of the joke. The loneliness was so prevalent and it hurt.  School society generally was unkind to me. When I inevitably meandered into the low status cliques, if I was even able to find a group; then I would often ostracize the others in those loosely formed groups. Often the groups I got in were the last option; I wasnt sure if they liked me and I barely liked them. I would usually feel like I had quasi friends mostly (acquaintances). I wish I had gone to a therapist or that I had gone to my mother or father to work out my troubles. I didn't in the name of seeking entertainment, in the name of being tough and in a attitude that it can't improve.   Being a punching bag may make you tough; but in retrospect: I'd have much rather have put my metaphorical character points into wisdom vs constitution. Things didn't improve in my adolescent real life because I wouldn't put my mind to it. I accepted defeat and escaped from it whenever I could. Things didn't get much better because of my cowardice.   I wish I'd asked for help more often when I was younger and I regret that I didn't. It's good that you came here and I hope you'll think about what we have to say.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder a few years ago, and have also been struggling with gaming addiction ever since I was around your age (I'm 22 now).  I wish I could tell you it gets easier and feed you rainbows and unicorns, but you and I both know that is a load of bullshit.  Depression sucks.  Addiction sucks.  People in your life can let you down and hurt you, so I can completely understand not wanting to open up to them.  Hell, it took me until this year to finally start working on myself, and damn is it difficult.  I applaud you for seeking at help at such a young age, and realizing that you are having a problem.  That takes a lot of courage, and is something you should definitely be proud of.  Seriously.  At age 16, I was still 100% oblivious to my problems and was just letting it consume me.  I have tried journaling in the past (and failed bc I'm bad at committing to things), and I have a few entries that sound extremely similar to this post of yours.  I knew what I was supposed to be thinking and doing, but for some reason I just couldn't force myself to do it.  And in turn, that made me feel like shit, and I would hate myself for not doing what I should be doing, which just sunk me into a further depression.  It is a vicious fucking cycle, and I am so sorry that you are dealing with it as well.  Here is something I have realized though, and something you should try to internalize as well: you are not weak, and this is not your fault.  You didn't choose to have depression.  You didn't choose to not fit in to society's standards of ""cool"".  If it were up to you and me, we would be two of the most productive people in the world, and everyone would like us.  Unfortunately it isn't up to us though, and it is easy for you and I to beat ourselves up for this.  Try your best not to though.  Relapsing isn't a sign of weakness, it is something that is completely natural.  Don't hate yourself or be disappointed, just try to learn from the experience.  It is the best we can hope for, but in doing so we will begin to see growth.  So you messed up, relapsed, and realized you aren't perfect.  Yeah, that sucks, but now let's realize something: you said yourself after binge-ing for 7 hours straight that   ""after all here I am, tired of it"".   What does this show?  It shows that you recognize that gaming isn't all it has cracked up to be.  You can see that you don't want to game all day and all night for the rest of your life.  You realize that there is something greater than gaming for you out there.  That is awesome, and extremely mature of you.  Congratulations! :).  What is the next step though?  If you don't mind, I highly recommend you check out this video on relapsing.  I stumbled upon this video as I myself was about to relapse two weeks ago, and I found it really beneficial.  Also, if you enjoy reading, I would highly recommend you read this article on how to quit video games.  I have found that it really resonated with me and my situation, so hopefully it will make some sense with you as well.  The hardest thing I have found about this journey is knowing what to do next.  I also quit gaming for a while, but then I was bored, or I got stressed and it was easy to fall back into my old habits because gaming is comfortable.  We have to really make a commitment to stick it out though, because you and I both know that there is so much more to this life than gaming.  We only have this one shot at life, so we might as well make it as awesome as possible!  I know it isn't easy, and I have only gone 6 days at this point with completely removing gaming from my life.  Everyday I am struggling, but things like this community have really helped.  Don't ever be afraid to ask for help if you are struggling, and I sincerely applaud you for making this post.

He'd still ask if I wanted to play from time to time afterwards; but it was pretty half hearted.   He is my best friend; although he was pretty shitty in that case up until I told him how bad it got. I also gave his wife parental control over my SC2 account for about 9 months so he new shit was serious in that way too.  I could expand but I'll leave it there.

StopGaming,393xo8,giovanni7954,5,Tue Jun 9 02:13:30 2015 UTC,"I was (almost) always a straight-A student growing up, until the last couple years of high school. I had no trouble doing exceptionally well in all my classes, and despite playing games way too much and putting very little real effort into school, I still did well enough to get accepted into a top-5 computer science undergraduate program.  Once in college, I had very little restraint on my daily habits, gaming or otherwise. I managed to do pretty well my first year, but the wheels were coming off. The second year I moved into an apartment with a bunch of stoner friends, and basically gave up on school. I failed out by the end of the year, and transferred back to the university in my hometown. Nothing had really changed though, so I failed out there three semesters later.  At age 22, after having such a promising future four years earlier, I was living on my friend's couch and working a shitty minimum wage job with zero prospects for the future. At that point, completely disgusted with myself and desperate for change, I joined the military of all things.  My life has gotten a lot better in the ten years since that lowest of lows, but I didn't stop gaming until a little over 6 months ago. At this point, I know I'll never play a game again. How do I know? Because I actually like who I have become, and I look forward to living each day as it comes. Playing games just brings back the old me, the me who hated himself and just wanted to escape from life.  You can do this man. Stay connected to others who are trying to quit or have already quit. It takes a long time to change, and sometimes it will feel like you are standing still or moving backwards, but if you can trust the process and trust that others have done this before you, then you'll be just fine."

I thought long and hard about whether quitting gaming was the right decision for me, and I eventually came to the conclusion that the potential for benefits of taking 90 days off (possibly turning my life around) far outweighed the downsides (short-term suffering and boredom).   I made absolutely sure quitting for 90 days was something I honestly wanted to do, then I wrote a note for myself stating the argument. That way whenever I wanted to relapse, I would have to use logic instead of emotion to justify it to myself.  Try not to go forward with just the idea that games are bad, and good grades are good, and so you should quit gaming. Honestly ask yourself whether and if so, why, you should quit. Because when you start experiencing boredom and hardship it is easy to look at this temporary hardship and rationalize yourself back to games."

You saw for yourself that you are way more productive without games. Look for some new activities, if you find yourself with too much time.   Don't worry about your little brother.

StopGaming,392tmw,Scriptopeia,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:14:42 2015 UTC,"I can relate to your way of thinking, but in a different way.  When I was still playing League of Legends and was about to quit gaming, I thought myself    ""But what about the 5 days of pure grind that I just did to climb rank 3?""  ""I can't potentionally quit now! All the time would be wasted!""    Afterall, I came to the point where this just sounds like excuses to not quit. Better quit after 5 days of gaming, than to continue wasting time.  If you want to hear my personal advice on your situation, which could possibly end in a shitstorm for me, then do the following:  Don't sell your computer. Mine is not even one year old and I spent 2000€ on my computer and around 500€ more for other stuff like headset, mouse, keyboard, sound, monitor etc.  It was always my dream to own one of these super strong gaming computers, but eventually I realized now that I don't want to live my life in a virtual world anymore.  Of course, I will always have the old memories of all the gaming sessions with my computer when I sit in front of it, but the only thing I did was uninstalling all the games and not visiting any game related subreddits or internet pages. You need to understand that you need to decide what's the best treatment for you!  I was a pretty hardcore gamer, spending 90% of my free time sitting in front of the pc. But I won't sell my stuff. I can always tell myself ""If you want to play, it is right there.. but I dare you to touch one single game you weak mtherfker"" This is how I remind myself everytime when I am down, how strong I actually am.  There is one simple rule that you can follow: ""If you want to do something, don't count the costs, or you might quit before even trying."""
StopGaming,392tmw,Scriptopeia,2,Mon Jun 8 23:20:13 2015 UTC,"I can sympathize with that advice. The only thing about selling it is that games are the only reason I need a computer that stupidly powerful. I have my Mac Mini which I use for nearly everything else and could always run Civ if I wanted, as well as a Windows/Linux desktop. I'm not trying to give up computers which I love, just games. If I give up games but keep my desktop, I'll have a $1000 brick sitting here."

But think about it this way: You can't undo what you did. You bought the computer, and with or without games, the $1000 brick will be there anyway. Don't think about what you wasted or not. (This can drive you insane for real)  If you really have absolutely no use for it and need the money, then sell it. Once again it's your decision. No one can evaluate your situation with your gaming pc.  I am just saying that I will keep mine, since it's my only one and I don't play on it even though I easily could reinstall all the games."

Now that you ask it I don't think I have that much issues with it (I switched to Linux a while ago)... Being able to have a few virtual machine running to simulate a small network is something that I want to be able to do; I can run one or two at once but with nothing in background.  Thing is, I'm sure that only 70 hours in the summer (~1 hours per day) might be reasonable, but spending 900€ JUST for that seem pretty pointless. And I don't intend to make it more worthwhile by playing more...  I can this can wait until I have either more money, or a job. But I still want to spend a few dollars, perhaps not everything. Thanks for your reply."
StopGaming,390q0f,Masivigny,2,Mon Jun 8 13:00:53 2015 UTC,"Well from what I understand now, I would advice against the computer.  It seems like you don't really need it.  The way I look at this sub and quitting gaming is as followed;  Reducing/quitting gaming isn't the goal here. No not at all; gaming,  just like every other hobby, is a legitimate way to spend your time in exchange for fun. If you truly enjoy it.  However, the catch with gaming, and why most people are on this sub, is that gaming, different from a lot of other hobbies, takes place in a virtual world, this means that all you accomplish in this virtual world, though real in a sense of the virtual world, does not exist in the reality surounding it, and the reality in which you actually live.  Thus by definition, all your accomplishments in this virtual world are virtual, as opposed to real.  That's why afterwards it feels like such a waste of time and doesn't leave you with a sense of accomplishment, because it literally doesn't add to you as a person in the real world, only in the virtual world.  Now your problem doesn't seem to be; should I buy a computer or not?  It is a far more pleasent problem;  How should I spend 900$ so I get the most fun out of it?  I understand; computers and computer games are a safe choice; you know you've had fun with them before, and you probably will have fun with them again.  However the goal here isn't to reduce/quit gaming. It is a means to free up a lot of time, which you can spend on things which also are fun, and atop of that also give you a sense of accomplishment, which virtual reality inherently cannot.  So just think about it this way; you don't have to spend 900$, you want to spend 70+ hours of free time for fun.  So just imagine the fun of doing, and the fun of attaining a skill of doing some activity for 1-2 hours each day for 70 days.   You can imagine anything; painting, reading, diving, travelling, partying, dating, rowing, baking, even gaming; you name it!  And then decide which you would have the most fun doing, and spend those 900$ accordingly, it doesn't have to be a bulk purchase. But think for example; a diving workshop, an extensive painter's kit, a shitload of books, etc., etc.  Just realize 900$ can bring you A LOT more fun and skills than 70 hours of gaming, even if it is as simple as 210 hours of gaming; but realize you are probably on this sub because you would rather spend 210 hours into something else; you just have to find what you would like to do for so many hours.  TL;DR: 900$ can bring you a lot more than 70 hours of gaming fun."

Anyways, some of the points that i identified with you:   Not having the emotional maturity to deal with life's difficulties.    Also     Alone on my own at 16 years old, all i did was game before and after college, i didn't study the subjects at all, at that time i didn't know what i was doing, i didn't have the emotional resistance to force myself to study, i was in a maze of addiction in which i didn't know how to get out of, i am thankful for the patience and strength that my great parents gave me, and i am overcoming this, i feel good like i can handle things.   Another thing:     I also am practicing my guitar and feeling a lot better throughout this gaming-free experience(not the first one but the most enjoyable so far), i'm nowhere near good at the guitar though lol, it's just that it's fun learning a new riff or lick, i just did it one today, felt good =P   And finally:     I also started at around 12 years old and spent countless hours at videos, guides, forums, and in the game itself trying to be better, i became good at the game, but imagine if i had done that with other  healthier ""Distraction""? Some of my peers that i identified myself with at age 15 and 16 went on to be doctors, graduates, married people already, and i feel like i got stuck in the cycle for too long, this is not a sad statement though, it's just a self-reflecting realist one.

StopGaming,38yqo6,Greysson,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear that things are going so well for you these days!  For the last few months I've been at a point where I realise that, aside from playing a few games of Smite/CoD zombies/Rome 2 with my friends or brother a few times a week my gaming isn't done much for fun but just to do something. There might be some points where I genuinely get enjoyment out of playing a game but mostly I just do it for the sake of doing it...I've lost count of how many times I've loaded up Rome Total War only to quit it because I can't be arsed and have no interest in playing it again only to load it up within 5 minutes, play another 20-30 minutes, etc. My big problem is just not knowing what else to do/not wanting to or having the drive to do anything.  This relates to something I want to ask RE something else you mentioned, that being antidepressants. I was diagnosed as depressed 2 years ago but refused pills because I wanted to figure stuff out on my own, 2 years later and I can't say much progress has been made and am thinking about asking for anti's so that I can have a more functioning life and will actually do stuff. As it stands I just don't have much drive/vitality to do much, I'm exercising again but even so feel quite apathetic about stuff. Would you say anti-depressants are a good idea? I've always heard about them making people lethargic so I'm worried that I'll end up being happier but still doing nothing due to side effects."
StopGaming,38yqo6,camerondare,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:49:35 2015 UTC,"You are so far ahead of the game already because you've come to this realization. That's progress! You aren't stuck in the gaming cycle unaware that you are stuck like so many people, so you can be proud of that. I'd definitely suggest checking out Cam's list of activities, picking a few and trying them. It doesn't matter if your heart is into it or if you are motivated, you can just say, ""Today, I am going to write a journal entry,"" and DO it and instead of judging your performance, be proud that you accomplished something different.  It hasn't all been easy for me. There have been times in the past 3 weeks were I have laid on my floor bored as hell. I literally thought to myself, ""Instead of going to my drug (gaming) for an escape, I'm going to lay here and be bored and feel uncomfortable emotions. If I don't want to feel like this, I will need to get up and go do something."" Instead of escaping, I would CHOOSE to feel the hard emotions I've been running from. I know it sounds kind of masochistic, but I believe it is part of the human experience. Eventually, I would get up and engage in something, whether it be something ""fun"" like music, or something ""work"" like cleaning.  As far as the anti-depressants - I can't make that determination for you. I can say that I was resistant to going on anti-depressants for about 2 years before I decided to try it. It made a HUGE difference for me. If you are thinking about trying anti-depressants, I would strongly encourage you to get into (and stay in) therapy first, see a psychiatrist (not your regular family doctor -- because psychiatrists are specially trained to deal with mental illnesses), and then make the determination if it is right for you. I believe a lot of people have trouble with anti-depressants when they just go to their family doctor, get a prescription, and don't support the medication with therapy to treat the underlying causes. To me, that is like going to the ER with a broken leg and leaving with only painkillers and no cast. Again, this is all from my point of view, and I am not trained or licensed in medicine.  Hang in there man! You will get through this!"

I was going to the student support centre at my uni and had a go at cognitive behavioural therapy, they weren't really all that great. At the moment I feel that I know I need to do stuff, I just lack the motivation or energy to do it - it's weird, it's not quite laziness, it's just like....everything is grey, so I cba. I've always described depression to me feeling like living in a kind of grey, dusty world (hence my username) so I'm hoping that anti's would help by removing that ""blugh"" haze I view everything with and get me out there and improving my life."
StopGaming,38yqo6,ShiningTrapezohedron,2,Mon Jun 8 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing. There's a lot you've shared that is completely normal for the experience you have while gaming and/or moving on.  Through what they call ""overexposure"" to gaming, there are three structural brain changes that happen. I have them detailed in this video.   Numbed pleasure response: every day pleasures no longer satisfy you Hyper-reactivity to gaming: everything else is boring, gaming is AMAZING Willpower erosion: due to changes to your prefrontal cortex   So what this tells us is that there are actual reasons why you lack the motivation to quit, find other activities to be boring (or experience the general ""bland/grayness"" type feelings), and why you enjoy gaming SO MUCH MORE than anything else.  What's important to know is that it's not that you don't have motivation it's that the brain your brain responds to it has changed. If you want to be more motivated after you quit gaming, this is a good video to watch. Most of us don't actually understand where motivation even comes from so if we don't understand it then how are we supposed to have it? :)  Hope that helps, I've had depression many times in my life and definitely relate to your experience. I support xamural's suggestion of speaking with psychiatrists. CBT can be beneficial, but sometimes it's not enough. ALSO, the experience you have with one psychiatrist/counsellor does not represent them as a whole. Some are very much better than others, so keep looking until you find one you click with.

I sometimes describe it as God or the universal spirit carrying me forward to fulfill my destiny/role on this planet (sorry to cosmic on you there).  I may have gotten some of this from my dad, and I am truly grateful for it. While he was completely emotionally unavailable, I witnessed him work nonstop (both at his job and around the house - yardwork, etc). Looking back, this might have been his version of gaming -- emotional escape, measurable progress, etc.  If you aren't meeting your obligations even after you quit gaming, what are you doing instead? It might be helpful to take an honest (albeit painful) inventory of really what you are doing with your time and also the reasons you are choosing to spend your time in these ways. I know I'm sounding like a broken record here, but therapy is useful for self-reflection since you are able to get an unbiased and non-judgmental perspective."

If you are looking for a way to start moving on from games with a real plan, read this article, and then you can follow the steps outlined in this post.  You're not alone and we've got your back. When I first quit games this was the status of my life:   My Life Was A Complete Mess:   I battled depression, struggled with low self-esteem and “feeling good enough.” I didn’t have very many friends, and the ones I did have were gamers. Not only that, but I didn’t even know how to make friends. I lacked confidence in general, especially with women, was constantly put in the dreaded friend zone and didn’t feel attractive as a man. I had little education, had dropped out of high school twice and never graduated, had no desire to go back or to ever go to college. I was in and out of jobs all the time, lasted two days as a landscaper, worked as a dishwasher at Earls, lasted about a week stocking shelves at Walmart, and disappeared from my jobs at Papa Johns Pizza and Booster Juice. Worst of all, to avoid having to get another job I deceived my parents by pretending to have a job at a restaurant and again at an internet cafe.   The one highlight in my life was gaming, but as the reality of the above came more and more in focus in my life, I came to acknowledge that although gaming wasn’t the cause of these issues, it was what allowed me to avoid having to deal with the situation.  The truth is, I just reached a point in my life, as you may have as well, that I simply no longer wanted to continue to live my life this way. Regardless of how messy and ugly my situation was, there was only one path: forward towards something better.   And little by little I've been able to improve to a better life. Check out the links above, that's how I started."

I have stopped using the drug and gotten rid of my syringes too but ever since I have became rather bored. With other drugs, (I used to consume crystal meth) I have never really gotten attached to constantly comsuming meth just a little more casual. I only really consume casual drugs. However would this just be a sub for heroin and is it a good idea or not? I'm off for summer now and don't really do much else apart from work-out from home and watch movies. Thanks to all that read and help as they can. :)   Sorry if this comes over as rude, but this post sounds ridiculous to me.   What do you expect from a console? Suddenly being able to play moderate? No, you will get addicted to your console.  Obviously you BECAME bored because all you ever did was play games and nothing else. Now that you have no games anymore, you got so much new free time.   Your brain needs to get used to real life conditions again. The video game reward system has corrupted your brain (your brain is addicted to constant dopamin flow), which basically makes you feel bored rather quickly on new activities, since they are not rewarding as playing a game.   You did a good job so far (6 days). Keep looking forward and make sure to not relapse to any kind of gaming.  edit: Your problem doesn't really lie in gaming. Gaming is just something that you used to not deal with your problems. Going from one console to another won't fix anything. Maybe you are very lonely, maybe you have problems at school... you need to take your problems at the roots and find a solution. Obviously this will be a really hard journey and everytime it seems to get difficult, your mind will want to play."

I now realize that whatever anybody wants to learn about, or improve on, the internet can be an extremely powerful tool to take those first steps."

StopGaming,38ve49,camerondare,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:31:27 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing. Many in this sub will relate to your situation. The comment by showgonewrong is spot on. It's important to have a mindset shift from trying to ""fill"" or ""kill"" your time to investing it in becoming who you want to be. Check the video link below for more on that.  Next, here are the quick answers to your questions:  Yes, you should make a schedule. That will help you know more about where your time is actually going and help you stay accountable to doing the things you want that will help you become the type of person you want to be.  No, reading and gaming are not the same thing. The stimulation you get from gaming is significantly different than reading, and actually causes structural changes to your brain over time (through overexposure).  So reading is cool, but what you want to find is three different areas of activities:   Mentally Engaging: something that is skill/achievement based. Resting: something to do at home when you're tired/bored. Social: something to help you make new friends. You're single, so this is also a great way to meet other people. :)   Remember that you gamed for specific reasons (they fulfilled certain needs you have), so to move on from games you need to fulfill the same needs with other activities. The three areas above are a good start.  Gaming is also just your go-to activity. So if you aren't intentional to choose something else you'll always go back to it. You can learn more about this and the needs gaming fulfills here.  For activity ideas, check out this thread and this thread.  Many other tips and answers to other common questions are in this thread.  Hope that helps! We've got your back. :)"

I know it's weekend and even I can't deny the big pressure of ""just one game"". (Luckily I uninstalled all games and download/installing takes 2-3 hours depending on my connection)  Eventually you came to a point where you realized that gaming is basically a pure time burner for you and thus you feel guilty.

Right now, I have one of the longest anti-gaming streaks since I remember. (And it has only been 9 days so far!)  The time after uninstalling will be damn unbearable, but I eventually realized that it is NORMAL, because our brain is used to have a constant feeling of rewards and growth through gaming.

If you want to stop playing games and keep failing, as long as you're making progress it's not an example of beating your head into a wall. Same story with relapsing.

Designers need to cater to heavy users/addicts or they will fall behind competitors. They might want to project an image of not encouraging addictive behavior, but they will always be forced to do so because of the nature of the market.  This is similar to how the alcohol industry operates. Their advertising campaigns target heavy drinkers, because the majority of their sales come from those people."

StopGaming,38lvs8,its0K,2,Fri Jun 5 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I think for me it's important to remember that our community is still new and because of that, we still have the opportunity to shape the conversation around our community in the way we want, and at least in my case, that means shaping it in a direction that leads to productive solutions, accessibility and ""buy-in"" from everyone who hears about it (community building) instead of in a way that alienates (all games are bad), isolates (all games are good), or just misses the overall point, complexity of the issue and hurts accessibility, imo (too much of a focus on a 12 step program/addiction centers/everyone is an addict mentality).  I think our community actually has a really incredible opportunity to be a leader in encouraging the world to rethink the way we approach problems, by being an example of how we took a step back to see our problem from a different perspective, and then approach creating community and solutions from that place. My friend Samantha Skelly is doing very similar work (to Game Quitters) with her company called Hungry For Happiness, which focuses on emotional eating instead of gaming, but we see so many similarities between both.  Anyways, if we all come together and step into our own leadership with this community, we can do an amazing service to the world. Our sub is small, but the # of gamers out there who are not aware that they are not alone is very large. It's only up to us to reach out to them. What we do now and how we shape the conversation now matters moving forward. It's much harder to fix a poorly told story later than it is to tell a good one at the start.

A lot of people focus on these counters a little too closely, thinking that they should mean you haven't touched a game in that time. But if you follow it so rigidly, you're kind of ignoring the whole point, which is that you have to be able to deal with gaming as something that exists in life, and rather than ignore it completely, we should be able to take part in it in certain situations without it pulling us back into addiction. So in terms of the OP, I think playing in that way is quite harmless and it improved his relationship with his family, it's a social event. Then because of the improvements to his life since quitting games, he can see that they're just not worth it anymore, except for situations like this. So the badge stands as a symbol of recovery.

Selling the xbox was difficult I just felt I should keep it. It was a good deal. I traded in my xbox 360 and got it for $250. But, keeping it just led to my relapse. I justified playing by getting forza horizon 2 and a Ferrari 458 Spider Racing Wheel set. I played about 3 times and got bored. Then I played titanfall and halo.   My friend that does StopGaming too, kept telling me I needed to sell it. It took me 2 days of thinking hard. Then on the third day I decided I'll sell it. I just needed time to accept that decision. I needed to make sure I would stick with it and not buy another xbox or gaming console. Now, idc. I can't wait till it's gone. Then I won't have to worry about triggers because I won't be able to game.   I hate older consoles because of the graphics. All of my urges are to play newer games especially with my gamer friends. It's a step in the right direction. For me, I'm not bothering with selling my ps3. I'm just going to put it in the basement with all my old gaming equipment. I have a wii and modded 360 with a kinect hooked up in my room still for the people that don't know I am doing StopGaming. Mario party with buddies or smash at a friend's house is the closet I get to gaming now. Other than that nope no exceptions.   If you're going to ask dude you're a hypocrite. You still play games with your gamer friends. That's because Mario kart and smash don't give me urges. First, it's at a friend's house and second those games are not my cup of tea. No offense, but I think Witcher, WoW, Dota, RPG's in general are stupid. The only reason I don't like it is because it's not my cup of tea. I'm a halo with buddies loser. The saddest part is I wouldn't even hang out with those kids in person because all we have in common now is owning an xbox one and playing halo.   Good luck and I'm glad to hear you already found something to do besides playing your ps3. Just try to find other hobbies because DDR is still going to mess with your dopamine receptors.

I am a compulsive gamer, gaming addict, whatever you want to call it. And I cannot safely play video games. If I pick up a game and play, I will become obsessed with it eventually.

I dream TV shows and games I played from my childhood occasionally also. Sometimes I also dream people and places that are long gone.  What I am getting at is that it is normal to rememeber. Things you dream about usually used to mean something to you, and your brain is used of thinking about it, so it is only natural to dream about it. Maybe it doesn't hold definitive meaning to your ""rational"" mind, but your subconscious could very well miss that kind of stimulus more than you can think of!   It takes time, it takes self growth to leave it all behind. Take the WoW example - when I just quit, I dreamt about it atleast once a week. Now more like few times in a year.   You can improve your sleep quality by two things in my experience - thought journaling and meditation. Both habits are very dear to me, and helped me through hard times when tackiling this, and other addictions.    I understand the frustration about hobbies not feeling ""right"".

Anxiety, sleep problems, everything else in life seeming flat and boring, tiredness and especially the using dreams.  Many of the people I know who are addicted to games have had using dreams when they stopped. (I haven't had using dreams with gaming, but I did when I quit sugar.  Go figure.)    The good news is that withdrawal symptoms usually get better over time or even go away completely.  As for quitting ""for good"" vs. telling myself I'll play again someday, I try to not do either one.  Every day, I get up and try to be present in this day, live the life I have right now right now, be the person I am right now right now, and not get hung up on tomorrow.  I won't be playing games today, and I have no specific plans to play them in the future, and that's all I concern myself with.  I won't be going to the casino today (I'm also a gambling addict--pretty much just an intense form of gaming with money and booze and flashing lights everywhere). I'm also not going to eat any refined sugar today, and, most importantly, I'm going to be alive today.  Alcohol and needles and pills kill you slowly.  Gaming addiction kills you completely, instantly, but just for one day at a time, one hour at a time, when you exist but are not living, just staring at a screen.    Today I'm alive and I'm loving it.  Peace and best wishes.

When it comes to your EDIT, from all the gaming you've done, your brain is actually going through a detox period that takes about 90 days for it to rewire back to normal sensitivity levels. During this time you may experience boredom in other activities, sluggishness or even apathy/depression like symptoms.  That can be a bit scary but what you want to know is if you're experiencing these they are reasons why you NEED to continue not gaming, because this is what gaming has literally done to your brain. Take the 90 day detox period to start feeling how it is to be ""normal"" again and you'll be able to see things through a new light. More info on this here.  During this time, make sure you stay busy with new activities, especially exercising each day. Use the Seven Minute Workout (app or web)  And make sure you're drinking lots of water (stay hydrated).

I find e-sports to be rather boring: it's just a MP game being played by someone who spent much of their time playing it and normally they are just games that require good eye coordination, the fastest APM on the keyboard and pre-planed or on-the-fly strategy. It's not much different from real sports perhaps, but the key thing is that you're not really doing anything physical (yes, poker, snooker and others are still questionable in my book). For me they are just games, competitive ones for a fact. And the worst of e-sports is that the games that are played could possibly not be supported in the future or could radically change and force the players to make a radical adaptation. Changing in rules or something related to that, doesn't have the same impact in real sports, has it does in e-sports.  E-sports are just the same as local tournments in your local store or in a friends house (LAN even) were, except they are being expanded worldwide and you can thank the mass growing of home Internet usage, the evolution of the ""Internet structure and technology"" and the applications themselves getting better (to provide live streaming and almost lag-free online gaming), for that."

I can lose track of time while playing, but it's usually an hour or two and I still have some sense of time having passed and remember to do important things like eating. With gaming, I could lose an afternoon and evening and only become aware of time again because it was dark and I was making mistakes while typing in the dark since I hadn't noticed time enough to turn the lights on. If I tell myself I need to stop practicing at a certain time, I can typically do it within 15 minutes. I might ignore phone calls while practicing, but in general, I use music to connect with other people, at least some of the time, not to ignore my friendships. Music also connects me to my emotions instead of numbing and ignoring them.  In short, I become more of myself (especially the parts of me I like) with music. I become less of myself with gaming."

Sure, gaming can be a hobby like anything else that is not physically exhausting, doesn't require human interaction and can be done from home (guess we narrowed down the choices quite a bit). But for some of us it is not, because of the characteristics described by /u/camerondare.   To expand a bit on that: Like I said, gaming is a somewhat reclusive hobby, that focuses a lot on positive reinforcement. In that regard I would dare to say it's inferior (hyperbole!) to sports, since sports requires you to go outdoors (=work) and it doesn't shower you in rewards and achievements, therefore I'd say sports teaches you more about yourself and about values that will improve your personality than gaming."

Guitar, for example, is very versatile; you can play it around the campfire, at a party, and at your friend's house, all of which brings people together and makes you a more interesting, fun person.  Next, gaming is much easier to invest too many hours into, effectively making it a procrastination/hindrance tool. You get deeply immersed into the game's realm and lose sense of the outside world. How many times have you put off using the washroom or eating while gaming versus reading, drawing or the like?  Lastly, music is like riding a bike. The ability to play an instrument will stick with you for your life whereas the ""skills"" you have in a game are rendered obsolete whenever the game is off.     Neither makes money most of the time, so what makes one more worthwhile than the other?   It's not necessarily about the money but rather opportunities opened up. I've written songs, performed in front of people, made friends and am forming a band through guitar. Video games can, you know, get you into competitions and stuff, though it's not as comparable to music most of the time.  I'm not against gaming.

StopGaming,38filv,uSgViPeR,2,Thu Jun 4 11:24:25 2015 UTC,"Playing an instrument and playing games have totally different effects on the brain, and on your life in general. I think the fallacy is in trying to judge whether or not you engage in a hobby because of its worth or usefulness.  If life is just this long stretch of time that you need to fill with random stuff and get over with, then I suppose it doesn't matter so much what you choose for your ""hobbies"". But that's not life. Life is you, and you are what you do, in a pretty literal sense. Your entire being, right now, is basically the sum of everything you've done up to this point in your life. It's just like ""you are what you eat"", since the cells in your body must be built from the food you ingest.  So, do you want to be a gamer, or a musician? If you want to be a musician, you'll play music, and you'll never even stop to consider the ""worth"" of the activity or whether it can make you money or not. And if you want to be a gamer, well... there's no need to conjure a justification for that either.  Me? I don't want to be a gamer.

Cooking can teach you how to be healthy if you cook a certain way, leading to a healthier lifestyle.   Being a serious gun owner, paying to get high professional training in order to teach yourself serious self defense techniques, weapons manipulation, and other ideas can help you tremendously in a self defense situation that you cannot get out of.

One day you're gonna have kids, or you're going to sit down with a girl, or you're going to be on holiday with a tour group, and you will hear the stories of what they did, and they'll want to hear your stories.

Sure, you can earn money with DOTA so in that sense it's worth about as much as competitive level chess skills. But I am going to assume that you have never been and are not a professional DOTA player so bottom line: it's just a hobby. You can dig deep and come up with stuff like ""it teaches you perseverance in the face of obstacles"" and whatnot but since it's a video game where you can hide behind the veil of anonymity, that's in your apartment and where you can get by with a minimum of human interaction I'd say all of these ""benefits"" of games are greatly overrated.   What I am trying to say is: DOTA most likely didn't teach you anything that's really worth keeping. Nothing that is essential to any part of your life.

Especially if you are good at it. Nothing will give you as much joy as a good win in such a short time and bad loses can cause very much pain.  I think such strong stimuli breaks the brain.  You can't just quit playing dota. You need to find something to do, something to work on and get better at. For me, it's programming.

StopGaming,38buss,Nazadil,3,Wed Jun 3 05:22:15 2015 UTC,"(2/3) All during this time, I never gave up watching Let's Plays.  I watched a Let's Play yesterday even, so I am still struggling with giving up on gaming.  On top of that, my girlfriend ended up moving an Xbox into her room so that she could watch Netflix.  A few months ago, I began playing Xbox games.  I discovered Dark Souls, an RPG that is extremely punishing, has a multiplayer aspect, and since it is on Xbox, has achievements.  I started out slow, but over the course of about a month I ended up perfecting this game (got all the achievements).  I have since moved on to Minecraft and Assassin's Creed IV, and am currently working toward perfecting those games.  It isn't to the same extent that Rift was in the past, but a little gaming turns into a little more gaming which then snowballs into me lying awake on my parents couch at 3:00 in the morning, about to type Rift into the search bar on Google to find the download link.  This happened last Tuesday, the 28th of May, 2015.  As I sat there staring at the blinking insertion point in the Google search bar, all the memories of the previous years came flooding over me.  I thought of all the hurt I caused to those around me.  I thought of how detrimental my gaming addiction had been to every aspect of my life.  I thought of what the repercussions of going down that road again would be.  I just couldn't bring myself to do that again.  Instead, something inside of me clicked, and I searched ""How to deal with Craving an MMO"".  I had to scroll past 7 links to ""Craving something new in an MMO, try this new awesome MMO!"" and other links similar to that until I found a link to this subreddit entitled ""Quit playing MMO's for 3 weeks and almost relapsed today"".   I read through the poster's description, and could relate to them 100%.  It shouldn't have, but I was shocked to see that I wasn't the only person struggling through this.  I had previously talked to my therapist about feeling addicted to gaming, but her only suggestions were to ""stop gaming"", or ""reduce the amount of time I spent gaming"".  All her advice felt hollow- like putting a band-aid over a hole in a tire and calling it ""fixed"".  Sure, it might last for a little bit, but what happens when it comes un-fixed and I relapse again like I have done in the past?  I have heard of people being addicted to drugs, alcohol, sex, etc. and to me, those all seemed like legitimate addictions.  For some reason though, gaming felt like it wasn't something that people actually got addicted to.  I mean, it's only video games, right?  I felt ashamed of my urge to game, and I felt, with suggestions like ""just stop gaming"", like I was just weak.  Like all I had to do was suck it up, and I was too weak to do that.  Luckily, I found this subreddit.  I can see that I'm not alone.  Someone in the aforementioned thread commented with a link to ""How to Deal with Cravings"" by Cam Adair.  I've been watching quite a few of his videos, and something about his story is really making sense to me.  His Tedx talk about Rejection really hits home with me.  Growing up, I moved 8 times to 7 different states all before the 6th grade.  As a result, I have always felt like an outcast.  Every year or two I would have to start all over at a new school and try to make new friends.  Even when I did make friends, I was never the most liked in my friends group.  In fifth grade, two of my best friends had parents that were Doctors and both lived in much larger houses than I did.  The two of them became better friends, and I felt like the outcast when the three of us hung out together.  I think that I still attribute that to their parents being much more ""successful"" than my parents, and I think that that may be part of the reason why I wanted to be a doctor in the first place.  When I moved to Ohio in sixth grade, most of the kids already had established friendships with kids that they had grown up with.  I was the new kid that didn't really fit into their cliques.  I never established strong friendships, and then when I moved onto 7th grade in the middle school, things just got worse.  The ""friends"" that I ended up clinging onto got more joy out of picking on me and I fell into the role of being the person that people laughed at in order to feel accepted.  I was always scrawny growing up- taking me until my junior year of high school to finally hit 100 lbs.- and I distinctly remember at a middle school dance hanging out with ""friends"" of mine and them playing a game of ""human ping-pong"" with me being the ball as they pushed me back and forth in the middle of a circle.  I played along and laughed with them, but honestly it hurt to be treated like a jester, only there for the amusement of others.  At a sleep over with a few friends in middle school, two of my ""friends"" decided it would be funny to gang up on the little kid and pull me across the floor by my hoodie, all the while I'm kicking and struggling to breathe because them pulling on my hood was choking me.  I remember I spent a while face down on the floor, ashamed to get up because I was crying and I didn't want them to see.  In eighth grade, my dad convinced me to join the wrestling team.  I finally felt empowered and able to prove my worth based solely on my skill match against someone of similar size, and this was all well and good until puberty started.  Essentially, I ended up developing a condition called gynocomastia, where there is a swelling of breast tissue around the nipples due to a hormone imbalance.  If you don't know anything about wrestling, you have to weigh in before each match in order to make sure you are not overweight for your weight class.  This requires you to strip down in a locker room full of a bunch of dudes and get on a scale to make sure you ""make weight"".  Needless to say, my ""puffy nipples"" attracted the attention of my wrestling teammates.  I was told that it looks like I have milk duds on my chest, and I became extremely self-conscious.  During my wrestling matches, I was no longer focused on beating my opponent, but rather on making sure that noone noticed my abnormal nipples.  This caused me to quit wrestling as I was no longer enjoying myself, but instead was absolutely miserable being tormented for something completely out of my control.  It has been over 8 years since I developed that condition, and to this day I am still ashamed to take off my shirt.  I can't remember the last time I went swimming, and I now regularly use tape and band-aids to try to hide the bumps on my chest.  Genetics weren't kind to me, as my face was also completely covered in acne throughout high school as well.  Needless to say, I don't have much self-esteem.  Instead, I am filled with lots of self-loathing and hatred.  I've never felt attractive, and I never felt intelligent since I always compared myself to my older brother in school, and where I was focused on trying to be ""cool"" and to fit in and be accepted, sacrificing caring about school and getting good grades and taking nothing seriously in life in order to avoid being made fun of, my brother applied himself to school and excelled.  Something I have realized is that I will not fully commit myself to things now in fear of being made fun of for caring about something.  Instead, I sit back and make snide, cynical comments about other people who are putting forth effort in order to be accepted by ""cool kids"". (2/3)"
StopGaming,38buss,soft_flesh,3,Wed Jun 3 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"(3/3) This isn't who I want to be though.  I'm miserable, and this strategy hasn't been working.  I found it so easy to become whoever I wanted in a video game, and as Cam said, to only be judged for my ability rather than things out of my control.  It has been a long time since I have thought about things that interest/excite me.  I am filled with a lot of anger, hatred, and cynicism.  I'm not quite sure how I am going to change that, but I am sure that gaming isn't going to help me figure out how.  I really want to be happy though.  We only have one life to live, and I am tired of being miserable.  I'm working a dead-end job at Starbucks, dealing with the awful customers of Starbucks, while also living with my parents who are on the verge of a divorce and are miserable to be around, I'm living in Ohio, the land of boredom, and I'm in a relationship that I am not feeling fulfilled in and am still unsure about whether there is any way we can move past the mountains of hurt that I caused in the past.  I was planning on moving in with my girlfriend when she moves out of her parents house in the Fall to attend Medical School, however she recently told me that her therapist and she both agree that it would be best for me to hold off on moving in for at least one semester.  I can't stay at my parents house any longer.  I still have two classes to complete to earn my Bachelor's degree, but honestly I am not motivated to complete it right now.  I have no immediate need for a degree in Zoology, and since I don't know what I want to do with my life yet, I don't want to force myself to be miserable any longer in order to complete this degree.  I have been tossing around an idea for a while now, but fear is definitely holding me back.  My uncle lives near San Diego, California.  He lives by himself, and has a spare room.  I absolutely love it in California.  I have been out to visit him a few times, and I feel genuinely happy when I am out there.  I am considering contacting him and asking if he would be okay with me moving out there with him for a few months to test it out, but there are a few things I am afraid of.  I'm afraid that, if I go, my relationship with my girlfriend will dissipate.  I know this is naivety on my part, but she is my first girlfriend, and in a month we will have been going out for 6 years.  6 years out of 22 years is a huge portion of my life, and that is something that is very difficult for me to let go of.  I care about her more than anyone in the world, but I think we may be at a point where we may be better off working on ourselves individually for a while.  I know it is something both my therapist and her therapist, as well as my parents, have suggested would be beneficial for both of us.  It is just really difficult to make that leap, especially when there is something in the back of my head screaming at me not to give up this relationship, and if I did it would be a failure on my part.  A failure to communicate, and a failure to be strong enough to fix this relationship.  Additionally, I am afraid that I might just be running away from my problems.  I don't really understand the difference between moving on and running away I guess.  If I move out to California, what am I going to do when I get there?  How am I going to put myself out there instead of just becoming a recluse and relapsing and leaning on my gaming crutch?  I bought Cam's ""Respawn"" guide to getting your life back on track, and am working on the first of 5 steps- getting rid of my games.  I permanently deleted Steam off my computer, along with any remnants of any other game on my computer.  I have yet to get rid of my Xbox games, but I don't have an attachment to them so it is just a matter of giving them away/selling them.  I had a conversation with my girlfriend about the Xbox in her room, and after a while she was elated to hear about the change I want to make in my life and was happy to move it out of her room to help reduce the temptation for me.  If I move out to California, however, I know that my Uncle is a computer person, and he also has an Xbox and used to play video games.  How would I explain to him what I am going through?  I guess I'm still ashamed of this addiction of mine.  It still feels like a weakness of mine.  Additionally, I am not sure how to stop watching Let's Plays.  It is a little harder to block YouTube/I don't know the best way to do it.  It is something I feel I need to figure out though, because they are definitely my gateway drug into getting hooked on gaming again.  I know I ought to ""just do it"".  I'm still really interested in finishing that Respawn guide though.  I also saw that he recently posted a 30 day challenge guide, and I am considering trying that out as well.  I know I have a lot to work on.  It is a little overwhelming looking at it, but I know that I no longer want to choose to let gaming have a grip over my life.  I know Cam also suggested meditation, so maybe I should give that a shot?  I feel like I'm making a step in the right direction though.  I have never spent this much time reflecting on my life and writing down how I feel before.  I apologize for the lengthy post.  It probably isn't what you are supposed to do on Reddit, but I am extremely new to this, so take it easy on me lol.  I'm happy that I found people who have gone through similar experiences though.  For a long time I have felt like I was all alone in this.  It has been a long time since I have felt accepted for being the person that I am, all my flaws and all.  I am putting myself out there to you all though, because this seems like a community that is full of supportive people who are all trying to better themselves.  I would love to become part of a community like that.  I'm posting this under an anonymous username though, as I'm still afraid of opening myself up fully (ironically this was my name in Rift, so that's a thing lol).  Hopefully I'll get to a place in life where I am no longer ashamed of being me though.  Again, I apologize for the lengthy post and if I said anything that I shouldn't have said.  It is kind of a relief to get this all out there though.  If you have any comments or advice, I would love to hear them.  I could use all the help I could get lol.  Well, if you read all this, thank you.  Seriously.  I hope to get to know you all better :) (3/3)"

I don't know if I have any useful advice - you are several years older than me - but it does seem great that you have come to terms with being addicted. I think that's a very mature and important step. I have never posted here before but only casually browsed, but reading your story I realized I need to get serious about quitting games. I am currently sitting at home, avoiding an important event in school because I'm tired as shit from being up far too late yesterday playing games. I am addicted to games. I need to quit, because games and browsing reddit for hours on end is seriously hurting me. I have a really important exam tomorrow that I need to study for, but instead I did fuck-all yesterday and just sat with my iPad. I think the problem is it's too easy to just open the game and play, when I have nothing immediatly pressing to do. I'm gonna go ahead and delete all games off my tablet now. Thanks for the inspiration."

It helps a lot to know that there are others out there struggling with the same things I went/am going through, so thank you for that.  I can completely understand where you are coming from in terms of procrastinating schoolwork for gaming.  I did it for many years, and I think part of the reason is just because I haven't taken the time to think about the bigger picture/goals I want to accomplish in my lifetime.  Instead I have been taking it day by day, and the monotony becomes too much to handle at some point and I fall back to gaming.  I haven't quite figured out how to break that cycle yet, but it definitely makes me feel better to know that I'm not alone in this struggle.  I hope the same goes for you as well."

I'm learning that we just need to take this day by day for a while, but now that I find myself outside enjoying this amazing weather, feeling the sun beat on my face, and the cool breeze blowing, it reminds me that it feels damn good to be alive.  It's a feeling that I have been missing for some time now, as I have closed myself off to the outside world and been consumed by gaming in my room, but boy do I miss this.  I know it is going to be a long journey to recovery, and I won't be discovering my purpose in life anytime soon, but I know that I never want to return to how my life was a few months ago.

StopGaming,38buss,camerondare,2,Sat Jun 6 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"Hey man,  I just got  through uninstalling my drug of choice (League) after a 2 week binge while reading this post. I had gone a month strong previous to that without gaming and it was a good month, but some heavy news fucked me up good and I went straight back into the horrible cycle that I'm used to of playing league for 5 hours, getting pissed off, uninstalling, reinstalling 30 minutes later, playing for an hour or two, getting pissed off. Uninstalling. Going to bed. Waking back up and starting that over. I'm also 22, doing a degree I don't really want but my dad wanted me to be a business major and go to a good school. Somehow I'm surviving that and I'm in my final year. I also had a medical condition that made me kind of weird looking as a kid and it made me really antisocial and angry that everybody would have girlfriends but me. I still have yet to connect emotionally with a girl and form a connection because my insecurities hold me so far back. I'm unhealthy because I do nothing but lay in bed and game. I've tried quitting multiple times but I keep going back, usually because of watching streams and i remember how it feels to win. I need to get my life in order in the next few months or I feel like I'm never going to get rid of this lifestyle. It's tearing me apart. I'm always pissed at everything and annoyed to be in public. I'm always trying to be home, so I can play. Making plans with friends is always their job, I feel like if they didn't care so much about me then I wouldn't have any friends. I can't even remember what it's like to feel happy just to be outside and breathe fresh air. I'm always imagining 'something better' I can't ever live in the moment. I know I want my life to improve but I can't get any desire to change. When I game i put everything on hold even things I know I like to do. It's so frustrating. I know I'm better than this. I've lived better than this. I always thought having a girlfriend would pull me out of this situation but seeing you in the same situation with a girlfriend kind of proves that that won't help. I'm done man. Starting today. I hope you stay away from it all as well. Best of luck."
StopGaming,38buss,jotakami,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:42:38 2015 UTC,"I can completely empathize with you man.  I always struggled to socialize, and found it much easier to be angry and cynical toward a lot of things that I saw wrong with this world.  Often times I would get overwhelmed with the anger and frustration, feeling hopeless and like there was no way I could make a difference anyways, so I just blew off some steam with gaming, which then turned into my crutch and how I coped with my anger.  And unfortunately, having a girlfriend actually probably made things worse for me.  I was never happy, so I couldn't make her happy, therefore I began to tear apart a person I truly cared about and brought her down to my level.  It was extremely selfish of me, and I do regret it.  It is also why I am considering taking some time off from our relationship too, because there have to better things out there for both of us, and I don't want to bring her down anymore.  I recognize that I am taking steps toward a better future, but I feel like I want to be a better person before I commit to trying to enhance someone else's life through a relationship.  In our fantasies, it sounds amazing, and many parts of a relationship are great, but in reality it is a lot of work.  And when we don't even take the necessary steps to work on ourselves, relationships can become more work than enjoyment, and that makes you more miserable than you were before.  There has to be more to life for us though.  Just because we were born with something we can't control, doesn't mean we can't be happy.  And I know there is a lot of shit out there in the world, and I could go on for hours about all the stuff that angers me, but I'm starting to realize that it really isn't worth my time.  This journey definitely isn't going to be easy, but I know that I want to do it, and it helps a lot to see that there are other people out there in the same boat as me fighting to improve their lives.

StopGaming,38buss,camerondare,2,Sat Jun 6 21:59:04 2015 UTC,"Long post, read it all, but since I don't want to miss anything important here's my bottom line of it:   You have two classes to complete a Bachelor's degree You are somewhat still together with your girlfriend but you don't know if it's the right one  Crappy job in a crappy place and home isn't rainbows and unicorns either   Let's start with education. Having a degree is never a bad thing. I don't want to push you to do something you don't enjoy and I am just going to assume that job perspectives in biology aren't better in the US than in Europe (= mediocre at best) but a degree is still a degree and having a sheet of paper that says ""You did this!"" can, I guess, help bolster your self esteem. Secondly, don't become a doctor because you feel like you have to. Trust me, I did that and a job with long hours and a lot of responsibility that you don't like at all (or even hate) is a permanent source of frustration. Med school and medicine (especially in the US!) is competitive and it's not something you do ""just to pay the bills"". There are other jobs that can do this way better. So I really applaud your wisdom and foresight that made you refrain from starting med school.   Relationship advice... hey I'd rather counsel the Palestinians and Israelis on how to overcome their differences than offer relationship advice, so I'll keep it neutral: if you don't love her and don't expect this to change, then there is no basis for any kind of relationship save for friendship. I don't think the two of you would be doing each other a favor by staying together if that is the case. If not... well let's not forget that she stuck with you through a lot of downs and very few ups so if you do love her she appears to be a great person but what do I know.   Moving in with your uncle: what does your therapist say about it? If he's a gamer and you don't have any friends in California then how do you imagine this scenario to play out? The stress of moving and adjusting to a new location coupled with a ""roomie"" who plays games can be a recipe for falling back into old habits.  Anyhow, it's hard for me to recommend any concrete steps to stop watching Let's Plays. Mental health issues can be a very important factor in furthering gaming or internet addiction and based on your story (+ the situation with your parents) it seems like there are several areas that contribute to the problem, but you only have control over some of them. But here it goes: You already did a super important and extremely challenging step - you quit Rift. Congratulations on that! Don't think that you're not moving forward because you went from Rift to Let's Plays, I'd still count this as a win and as a sign that you do have the power and self discipline to change your life. I could imagine that moving to California and getting rid of your gaming equipment could be a great way to ""restart"". There are big cities with interesting people and quality universities to attend. You would have to make sure that your uncle knows about your goals though, as in, tell him about your issues with gaming and Let's Plays so he can help you with the struggle. Most importantly though, you are going to need ""default activities"". I can totally understand that, when things look bleak, you need a pick me up, which happens to be Let's Plays. We all need some mental downtime, when we can just turn off our brains and enjoy something even if it's meaningless. It shouldn't be your default state though, which it appears to be. Have you ever tried not watching Let's Plays for e.g. 1 month? You already quit Rift, so I guess you could give this a try too. It would free up a lot of time and force you to find relief in other things. It's just about breaking the cycle here."
StopGaming,38buss,Polar952,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:50:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton for taking the time to read through my story and offering advice.  I definitely see what you are saying about the degree, and I know at some point that I will finish it, but I think for the time being I just need to take a break.  You are correct about the jobs being bleak in the US for bio majors.  It is essentially either going to graduate school, or finding a research lab to work it (which I did throughout undergraduate and I didn't enjoy it).  What I have been thinking is that, since I have no real motivation to complete the degree right now, I would have a better time finding a job/direction to strive for that requires the degree and using that as motivation to complete it.  Right now, I have taken 3 courses since I withdrew from school a year and a half ago, and I got 2 C's and had to withdraw from the third class because I was failing.  Needless to say, this hasn't been helping my self-confidence much, so that is mainly why I am opting to put it on hold for the time being. As far as the relationship advice goes, I appreciate the straightforward way of approaching it.  I know that I do love her, and she is a wonderful person, but I am beginning to think more often that we would benefit from a little time off to work on ourselves individually.  That was her goal when she separated from me this past October, however, I wasn't on board at the time because of a fear of being alone (we have been together for over 5 years now, and we have had issues with co-dependency for the majority of the relationship).  I think I'm finally beginning to acquire a greater understanding of what my therapist has been meaning when she tells me that I need to work on myself though.  I need to do this for my sake- not anyone else's.  It is extremely difficult to make someone else happy and to grow as a couple when I am so unhappy and unwilling to grow, so that's why I'm leaning toward a separation for the time being.  I'm not looking to get into a new relationship with anyone, and she is going to be extremely busy with Med school beginning in August, so it might be an ideal time. As far as moving out with my Uncle to California, I think it is an excellent idea to fill him in on my situation.  He has always been genuinely interested in my well-being, so I feel that he would be open to helping me through this.  I also agree with your idea to give up Let's Plays for a while, and think that it could be highly beneficial for me.  Right now it is my default because it is comfortable, and I have established somewhat of a community around these let's players, so it won't be easy.  If I can find the correct things to replace YouTube with, then I feel that this would be easy.  That is part of the reason why I want to move out to California.  Out there, the weather is always beautiful, there is access to the ocean just a few minutes from my Uncle's house, so I could try to learn how to surf and/or just go paddleboarding out on the water, and there are also mountains not too far of a drive where I could try to learn how to snowboard or something.  There are also tons and tons of places to hike, so it would be difficult to get bored out there.  That is in stark contrast from where I am living now- boring suburbia, where everything is closed by 10pm, and the few parks we have around here are all very similar and I have visited most all of them.  I think this change could really be beneficial to me in the long run. Anyways, thanks again for taking time to read and offer advice.  It is really nice to see that there are people out there willing to lend an ear and some wisdom.  That is something that I could definitely use more of in my life right now, so thanks."

I think I've mostly resolved my compulsion to game but I still have a major procrastination problem when it comes to doing college schoolwork and studying I need to but don't want to do.   I tried setting up a schedule but whenever the schedule says I should do schoolwork I do anything but work. Working part time and scheduling my time off with stuff I want to do like learning an instrument, reading, etc. is not really a problem.

I get so caught up in my fear that I will mess up the things I care about that I avoid actually trying to do the work. Perfectionism is dumb. There is no such thing as perfect as far as humans are concerned and to attempt to be perfect will just lead to frustration and failure.   Focus on the work rather than the result.

So when gaming companies are pushing games that really hit me with nostalgia it really feels like I'm missing out. And I know when the new Zelda or Mario game comes out it'll be nigh impossible to avoid hearing about it because those games really defined my childhood. Some of my most cherished memories really lie at the heart of those franchises and it's beyond hard letting go.

Moving from games to browsing could be the first step on your way to living without video games (permanently or temporarily). After a while you might get bored of browsing random websites too, which would give you an incentive to branch out and at least try new hobbies. Right now, because of the years of excessive stimulation by video games, your brain just isn't wired in a way that allows you to enjoy non-gaming related activities (simplification and hyperbole).  If you want to keep your XBox one why not just tell your parents that you want to quit and give them your XBox, so they can safeguard it for a set amount of time (e.g. 3 months)?  As for career advice: I always suggest that people try to envision what their life should look like ten years from now and then do whatever it takes to get there. Nowadays everyone is supposed to look for a job that they love and that fullfills them, but for most people that is a futile task. It's completely okay to have a job that you don't hate nor love and that just pays the bills. If physical therapy is something you like and that will allow you to live the kind of life you want then go for it. It's very hard to recommend anything specific without knowing anything about you (money, strengths, weaknesses, goals, family, educational background etc.). The only general rule is: More degrees and better degrees on average equal more income, more job security. Obviously there's always that homeless guy with a degree from Harvard but those are statistical outliers.   Last but not least: Have you ever seen a competent doctor, maybe in a hospital that specializes on these disorders? Seems like you have untreated health issues."

StopGaming,385bj1,AnonymousOutcast,3,Mon Jun 1 23:30:36 2015 UTC,"I am fairly new to this subreddit, but I will give you some key-points that I understood in the aspect of ""gaming-addiction"".  First of all you need to find out why you play video games.  You already mentioned that you use video games as kind of escape, but what are the reasons?   There is always something bigger behind this, and realizing + understanding the reasons will make a great difference.   I know that it's easier written than actually to find the roots that cause your situation. I can only tell from my own experience, that in the past years I got very anti-social and lost too many contacts and friends, because I rather spent friday night at home playing League of Legends.  Now that I know where I can improve, I try to work on it.  Do I feel good after uninstalling League of Legends? Oh hell no. This is currently one of my worst times ever. I feel exhausted, I feel unmotivated, sad, lonely and I have plenty of new time that I don't know how to use.   Do I regret my decision to quit video games? No, I don't.   Because I know, even though this time right now totaly sucks, it will go away if I stay strong enough and look forward into the future.  Your next question I can only understand too well. As well online   as in real life we look for people that share the same interests as we do.  And since we most likely did nothing else than gaming, the majority of the people we cooperate with are also gamers.  This is a nice video about how to stay friends with your gamer friends, that helped me personally in a great way If you want I can also summarize the key aspects of the video if you are still not sure what to do.  To your last point: Looking back at the beginning of my post, you will eventually realize that just selling or deleting your things won't necessarily help. Because even though we got rid of our gaming setup, we still carry the real problems in us.   I do not deny the fact that getting rid of the computer and games can work, but I personally approach this in a different way.  And for all the people reading this right now, who are going through this tough time after quiting video games:  It won't be easy, and your mind will set up many traps to get back to gaming, but you need to stay strong and not play under any circumstances. Withdrawal feelings will come and they are not bad, but instead of resigning to them, you need to accept them and learn how to cooperate with them.  You are here because you acknowledged your problems and to quit gaming.  This is a HUGE step into the right direction, where other people already fail.  I have never written a post like this before, and I am by no means an expert on this area, but if I can support atleast one person with this, then this time was worth.  I am just a former gaming addict, who is fighting for the good of his life."

StopGaming,383sov,iwillwilliwhowilli,2,Mon Jun 1 17:28:12 2015 UTC,"hahaha your story made me laugh really hard. I remember playing an online game, fighting people and arguing really hard with them. Until I added one of them on skype to arrange a 1on1. That's when I saw his profile picture, a fucking 10 year old kid. I was arguing with a kid about something that doesn't even exist or had any importance whatsoever.  Anyways... I managed to quit smoking and cut down my coffee intake to just one cup in the morning. Also, haven't played games for a month  but I had a short relapse 11 days ago.  I (just like you) tried to quit everything at once and it felt like going through hell. I was able to handle the emotional pain though. What I was not able to do, was to function properly. I was just lying on the floor and trying to deal with the emotions that suddenly came up. At some point I realised that this is not helping me at all.   So i decided to quit it one by one. Starting with smoking. After about two months I felt ready to quit my next addiction, video games.     What I am trying to say is: You don't have to rush it all at once. Truly recovering from an addiction takes a lot of time and effort. Just abstaining won't fix your issues. It's just going to be a matter of time before you relapse.    Ask yourself, which of these addictions is holding me back the most? And start with that."

At some point you reach that bottom and say enough is enough. What sets you apart from most people is the courage to change.  So rather than regretting lost time, cherish the time you have now.

I have an unrelated question, and I was looking at your post history and liking your insights, so maybe you can help me with this without me having to make a new post:  I'm currently coming out of a major relapse, as of yesterday in fact. A wrinkle is that I'm also simultaneously quitting cigarettes and caffeine, and it's all pretty overwhelming and anxious for me, like it's too much at once and maybe I should hold off on my other addictions to give me breathing room. Do you think it's a mistake to quit it all in one go? I'm so tempted to keep up other addictions as a way to make the gaming withdrawal lessen. It feels like rationalising though."
StopGaming,383sov,zbud,3,Mon Jun 1 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Good questions and I'll try to provide what I can offer.  At the time, I saw my relapse as something horrible. In retrospect, it's just another part of recovery that screams ""you're on the right path, but that didn't quite work out the way you thought it would.""  There are legitimate physical withdrawals to quitting cigarettes and caffeine. Some people are able to quit cold turkey and others have to phase out. Considering that you're going to need to really focus on not gaming, you really need to keep your wits about you to the best of your ability. The last thing you need while you're not gaming is to be anxious. So you're going to literally give yourself some breathing room and focus on taking deep breaths to calm yourself.  There are a few possibilities and options. Here's how I see it:   You can quit all 3 cold turkey. High risk, high reward. You're going to have to deal with all sorts of fun stuff at once. Your brain will make you feel like you're bored because you're not playing. You will be craving cigarettes like no other and on top of that you get massive headaches from lack of caffeine. The good news is that you get all of them over at once. The bad news is that you will be the emotional and physical equivalent of a woman that's 8 months pregnant for a period of time. You quit gaming and simultaneously phase out the cigarettes/caffeine over time. This is a slower process on the chemicals (cigs/caffeine), but you can really hone in on the gaming. This is the option that I'd recommend. You'd just have to be sure that you don't replace your gaming time with cigarette time. I believe there are apps and other products that can help you phase them out. I don't smoke so I can't really help you too much there. You can quit one at a time. I would still recommend option 2 over this since you really want to make changes to your overall health. With that being said, if you focused 30 days on the gaming only and then moved onto the cigarettes, I believe that's also a healthy option. Caffeine could come later.   Life Pro Tip on quitting caffeine: Most people drink caffeine for the energy boost. If you aim to drink 1 gallon of water a day, you will experience the same boost and also speed up the flushing of toxins out of the body. You'll also lose weight much faster (you lose water weight when you drink more water since your body knows that it's getting a constant supply and also you give your body it's #1 tool for digestion/fat burning functions).  Good Luck!  Edit: One more thing. You asked if it was a mistake to try all 3 at once. While I listed 3 options, you will notice that I placed the gaming addiction as the first thing to stop. I can't tell you why you smoke cigs and drink too much caffeine, but changing the gaming behavior first should help you see the greatest results. You have to snap out of the routine you're in. It takes time and as you know, some mistakes are normal along the way!"

StopGaming,37zk1a,bboynerdy,4,Sun May 31 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on taking the first step, looking at yourself critically and recognizing a problem.  I would suggest taking it easy though... changing literally every aspect of your life all at once is difficult. You have to learn how to change your behavior first, and then you can start applying those principles to each aspect of your life that you want to change in turn.  Start with one thing, the one that has the biggest negative impact on your life. For me, it was actually alcohol. I stopped drinking 467 days ago (~15 months). At the time, I suspected that I would need to stop gaming as well. My life was busy enough that it was impossible for me to game addictively all the time, but I knew that gaming was eating up precious time away from the rest of my life. However, I tried not to worry about the gaming as I focused on what it would take to stop drinking.  Quitting alcohol was difficult. But the attitudes, behaviors and habits that I learned in order to quit drinking are now the foundation for any other change in my life. And eventually, when I knew it was time to put down the games for good, I was able to do it without a lot of struggle. I knew the path to follow, since I had done it with alcohol already.  So anyways, I wish only the best for you as you change your life tomorrow, but if it gets overwhelming then remember that you only need to change one thing today. If you can change one thing today, then you can change one thing tomorrow. And if you can change one thing tomorrow, then you can change two things next month. And if you can change two things next month, then you can change three things next year. But it all starts with today."

StopGaming,37yz9g,jotakami,2,Sun May 31 22:15:46 2015 UTC,"That first paragraph about escaping from life was so true for me as well. Understanding the harm that gaming can do to you really helps when you're trying to quit.  But you're also right that the moment you stop gaming, the problem isn't solved. The ""problem"" was actually created over years and years of escaping from life--habits of thought and behavior that are actually part of the fabric of your brain now. Removing the games only allows you to now begin working on recovering from that problem. I suppose the good news is that the brain is very malleable, and it's amazing how much you can change in six months or a year.  A suggestion: try some habits that really focus on the whole ""rewiring the brain"" aspect of recovering. Meditation, journaling, and prayer are three that can be a great foundation for any other change you want to make in your life. Yes, I know people tend to sneer at prayer, but it doesn't have to be religious. I am not religious and don't believe in any kind of god, but saying some secular prayers in the morning and before bed helps to focus my mind on the person I could be."
StopGaming,37yz9g,jotakami,2,Sun May 31 20:35:20 2015 UTC,"The problem definitely isn't solved and I think that a lot of people (myself included) relapse because quitting video games doesn't solve it. They get to thinking that ending that behaviour didn't change a thing so that obviously wasn't the problem. Then they jump right back into games, content that they now have an excuse to give in again but armed with an excuse to do so.  Our brains didn't start out so messed up. Some series of events and choices made us this way so better choices can set us straight. It's going to fight me every step of the way but I'm comfortable with that, it'll make the victory that much sweeter.   Meditation is, as I've heard from literally everyone I know who has tried it, one of the absolute best ways to spend your time. I've dabbled in it but I will soon be making it a daily habit. It just centers you and puts things in perspective, not to mention it eradicated anxiety and clears your mind."

At 16 you have so much time to develop skills, hobbies and social skills. You really do create your own path and results in life and for you to realise that the gaming lifestyle isn't working for you at 16 means you have a lot of potential ahead of you.  You seem quite a competitive and driven person since you said you would like to be a pro gamer which to me says you have a lot of ambition.  I however dont think gaming is what you really want because as you said yourself you feel hollow at the end of a long gaming session and because you have posted here.   It was at 16 that I got into competitive gaming and started neglecting my social responsibilities and other hobbies. Im now 22 and have only just realised what a waste of time all those years of gaming were!   You say you are weak and everything else seems boring. There has been a lot of posts on this forum regarding that but essentially it is because video games over stimulate your brain. Put some distance between yourself and games and after a week or two other hobbies will seem fun too!

You're not your ideal self (nobody is at 16, believe me) but that doesn't make you stupid or weak. It's an important time in your life. Want proof that you're not stupid? You've recognized a serious problem in your life and are already taking steps to fix it and you're not even old enough to vote. Buddy, you're way ahead of most of us.

StopGaming,37yb2j,jotakami,1 point,Sun May 31 16:53:55 2015 UTC,"You're in the right place, brother. When I was 16, I played games every minute I could. I had few friends, social anxiety, no self-esteem, and didn't understand the rest of humanity. I failed out of college twice because I couldn't stop gaming, and my family cut me off.  I'm 31 years old now, and the last game I ever played was a little over 6 months ago. The past 15 years I have played games off and on, more or less addictively, but one thing has been constant: if I start playing a game, I forget about everything else going on in my life, and the longer I play the worse I feel.   I didn't like myself at all when I was 16. When I was gaming, I at least forgot about my self-loathing. But when the game stopped, I hated myself even more. That's the hardest part: when you stop gaming, you will feel like shit, and you know that the easiest way to get rid of that feeling is to fire up the game. But if you can sit in that feeling, and not run away from it, just let yourself feel it, then you can start to move beyond it."

I definitely find it's easiest to break any pattern you're in when you travel and don't have as much access.  It's great to start new hobbies when you remove games. One of the reasons why we game is because we just don't have anything else we've chosen to do, so they become our go-to. Dusting off the DSLR and getting back into photography is definitely a good way to break the cycle of gaming. I'd suggest coming up with a project you could have for photography. Maybe 1 new photo each day? Some sort of creative challenge?  Regret is common to feel but it is what it is. You're in a better place now, focus on moving forward to the new goals you have!

The time you would spend playing video games is going to be filled with other activities now, of course, but I think recovering from a gaming addiction needs something deeper. I had a lot of ingrained habits and patterns of thinking as a result of my many years of gaming. Something that has helped me a lot in ""rewiring my brain,"" so to speak, is reflective habits like meditation, journaling and prayer."

And there are reasons why you love them as much as you know, just as we have!  So, one thing I want to share with you is there's a reason your willpower is weak, and it's because from gaming a lot you've actually experienced structural brain changes, and one of them is called ""willpower erosion,"" which is similar to how it sounds - your willpower has been weakened.  If you want to learn more about this watch this video.  So what research tells us is that we want to go through a 90 day detox from games in order to give our brain a break, so I would recommend starting that, and then when you're done you can reevaluate whether you want to game more or not.

Except my education affairs - I don't like the mere idea of such learning, but I'm obligated to do it.  Games are just a lot superior as way to have fun: you just sitting there comfortably, pressing random buttons, and it makes you feel good.

StopGaming,37yfuu,jotakami,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:33:26 2015 UTC,"I will second what Cam has said. Your willpower is weak because you can't stop gaming, and you can't stop gaming because your willpower is weak. Any habitual behavior, repeated over many years, will cause structural changes in the brain. Stopping the behavior is only the first step; you have to proactively work on changing the wiring in your brain after that. And that can take time, maybe a lot longer than 90 days.  Personally, I've been addicted to quite a few things--weed, alcohol, games--and there's not a whole lot of difference in the way they affect me at a fundamental level. I quit drugs and alcohol first, and that was a major challenge. The longer I was sober, the more I noticed that I tended to crave games at the same time that I would crave a beer.  A question I want to ask: What do you need to ""fix"" in your life? Do you think that you life is broken because of your gaming habit, or is the gaming habit just getting in the way of fixing it? If you are able to stop gaming, and fix your life, and resume gaming, do you have any reason to believe that the same problems won't happen again?  For me, playing video games was a way to tune out from everything else going on in my life. Alcohol tends to have the same effect, but it's easy to see how alcohol actually causes problems by itself: hangovers, DUI, health problems, etc. Games don't seem to have a direct relationship with problems in your life. But they do, just in a subtle way. By tuning out, you end up ignoring the problems that arise in the natural course of living. And the longer you tune them out, the harder it becomes to take action, and the worse they get.  I rambled a bit there, but I just wanted to share my thoughts and experience. Feel free to shoot me a message."

I also use app called Puncher, it's like a calendar, where you can rate your days and leave comments. 9 from 10 days are ""very bad"" or ""bad"" (1 to 5 grade), and the reason is simple: I spend half of my time on leisure. Including sleep. Meanwhile, I suppose to attend my classes, find job, learn how to earn money, learn to draw, learn to play guitar, improve my English skills, do sport, etc. I did all those things, but quite occasionnaly... Most of the time when I felt guilty and erased all my games (did it billions of times). Oh, there's a lot of things need to be fixed.  Life was always very kind to me, way kinder than I deserve.

There is also the hurdle that there are so many other factors to consider, mostly regarding how you two are in your relationship. Things that we cannot know and can't provide specific advice towards. But in general, we are a community of people who have come to realize the harm that games were doing in our own lives. His conduct shows that its a problem, either a coping mechanism or a relapse into an addiction that he has always had.  I'm 31 and I have noticed that games have become a coping mechanism for me in the last several years. Failure at work or in relationships and I turn to games. Problem is, the relapses last for months until my attitude has become adversely affected by them and my life has been put on halt.  My advice, which I do not presume to be solid advice, because I don't know you guys, is to find a way to talk to him about it as soon as possible. Even better, would be to see a therapist yourself.

If your husband uses gaming as a coping mechanism and is going through a difficult time it would make sense that this could lead to an increase in gaming time and/or spending.   I can only speculate but maybe your husband isn't feeling as good as he normally does from playing games (due to both yours and his unfortunate circumstance) and is trying to purchase in game content to get that gamers high / good feeling which he can normally get from just playing games. (i.e; compulsive purchasing/shopping therapy)  That said I don't know what game he plays but from my experience with LoL/CSGO £36 alone is a lot of money and would get you a lot of content for the game - let alone with multiple transactions of £36 (In LoL you would get 6+ skins for £35).  I am unsure as what to suggest but if he is purposefully deleting the emails then you know that at some level he feels bad or guilty about those purchases but maybe he feels he needs them to be happy. One option that I can think of you trying is to try and engage with him while he is gaming, try and connect with him over the next week or two and try to learn about the game (ask questions etc.) That way he will be more focused on teaching/explaining the game and will feel you understand a part of him - a hobby he is passionate about.  I am not saying this will solve the problem but I would hope that he would not feel the need to compulsively spend money on the game in order to feel good if he feels happy teaching/explaining you something he spends a lot of energy doing.   That way if/when you do bring up the issue of his spending you can come from a position of compassion and understanding that won't cause confrontation / a deer in the headlights affect - denial/lies etc.   Hope that helps!"

Seeing how he's being so secretive about his online gaming spending it seems like he is either ashamed or just scared to approach you on the concept of gaming transaction. Yes, it is not something to be proud of, but you should give it a few more weeks to subside, and carry on with life. Unless you're in a serious financial crisis, it is best for you to continue as normal and watch it cease over time.  There's nothing worse than being cornered and berated when you're trying to cope with grief. Your husband will definitely feel oppressed and distressed if you decide the confront him about it, seeing how gaming seems to be his current outlet right now. Instead you could spend more time talking to him, help him get over his grief, take him out to see the sun and have a picnic, do little things here and there to make him happy and be himself again. Who knows, if gaming is a hobby of his, why not invest some time to learn about it and play with him time to time?  To sum it up, its best for you not to confront him and distress him, but instead invest in other activities to distract him out of gaming and direct his interest in other things.

I was engaged at the time (married now) and felt the shame/guilt of the combination of a debting and gaming addictions. I still haven't told my wife that I spent during that time, but I will at some point. It was much more than your husband has spent.  Most games have micro transactions today. This didn't used to be the case. Games that offered micro transactions preyed on the 5% of players that desperately felt that they had to get ahead of the curve. I was one of those players and I've spent countless thousands of dollars on gaming over the past 8 years or so.  The only way I could stop myself from spending was to delete all my games. The real issue was my addiction to games, so deleting my games and telling my wife that I was trying to quit was the first step. My finances and spending have improved through hard work, self honesty, and help from others.  I know this subreddit is called StopGaming and I don't know if your husband has a gaming addiction. If he does, you will need to support him 100% and stop gaming with him. If he has other spending issues, I would suggest a few things:   When you have a spending problem (and gaming for that matter), the last thing you want to do is talk about spending. So expect him to be angry/upset/ashamed when you bring it up. It's gonna take him some time to process and prioritize. Stay firm and let him know that this isn't acceptable and he's hurting your joint future by his individual spending habits. Once he's calmed down, point him (and yourself) towards professional and group help. I would suggest getting a financial advisor for both of you so he gets the bigger picture and sees how his spending affects your joint ability to save and invest for the future. I would also suggest that he gets help for his gaming/debting/spending addiction. Choosing one of those is fine. If he's spending only through his games, you can join the online CGAA (see side bar) meetings with him. You're married now, so there's really no such thing as ""snooping"" in a healthy relationship. This could be the moment that brings you closer together if you keep a positive attitude and stay by his side no matter how difficult the journey. My wife is so much happier now that I don't game. Luckily, our relationship was built on communication and empathy, so she was able to understand what I was going through. Remember, you are recovering with him.

But since each transaction is the same it sounds like he is either buying ""in game currency"" or some kind of ""credits"" to use in game to give him an advantage.  What is the name of the game he is playing? It helps to know what genre it is as each has its own unique addictions and therefore solutions.  Honestly- and i'm not trolling here- the best way to deal with it is to kneel down and give him several blowjobs a day with as much love and lust as you can muster. Passion.

I will second the idea that video games, over time, will affect the structure of your brain in some decidedly negative ways. You can call it addiction if you want, as some people do, or not but it's all the same. There were times in my life where I was obviously a game addict--playing 10-12 hours a day and ignoring almost every other obligation in my life. But most of the time it was just a fun habit that sometimes swallowed an entire weekend and left me feeling empty inside.  I've come to the conclusion that ""casual"" gaming, even just a little bit, is just not worth the effect it has in my life. Games have always been an escape for me; if I was bored or tired or frustrated then those feelings would melt away almost instantly when I fired up the game. But the longer I used games as an escape from those feelings, the less and less capable I was of actually dealing with them.  There came a point for me where I knew that I couldn't play games anymore. I had become aware of the effect they had on me, how I felt before and after playing, and knew that I just had to let go. I'd suggest that if you do stop for a while, and begin again, pay attention to how it feels. Ask yourself if this is something you want in your life or not."

But most importantly I'd say just enjoying life, and spending time with my wife and kids without if feeling like it's just something to get through as quickly as possible so I can make time for games.   Fuck the zero!   Yeah, for sure, fuck the zero.  I have no desire to go back to that."

StopGaming,37pt0m,unconsciouslyrude,2,Fri May 29 15:04:10 2015 UTC,Before even reading your post I'm sure it's procrastinating as it is with me as well. I have a lack of decision making going on and it's causing me to prolong things that don't need to be prolonged. We must be mindful when this Happens so we can prevent it.
StopGaming,37pt0m,jacoballen22,2,Fri May 29 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"That's a wise conclusion that I also am grappling with.   I was just thinking that the aversion/procrastination towards certain activities is because they are seen as boring, ""really fucking boring"" or worse ""hard and really fucking boring"" shudders. The tendency of labeling of an activity as aversive, boring, hard may have started very early in our life, and may be exacerbated or simply come from a feelings of inadequacy in those activities (for me I feel a bit inadequate to wholly inadequate in reading, comprehension and recall). To clarify their is a negative opinion added to the activity when you define it as an obstacle, task, ""fucking thing I gotta do"".  Piggybacking on Camerondare's suggestion of mindfulness:  meditation could serve as a ""catalyst"" to help you to realize when you are being negative. If you are mindful of your prior attitudes toward aversive activities; then you can quickly apply a countermeasure in the form of changing your attitude. <---This method is generally the basis of cognitive behavioral therapy BTW. Back to the how-to: you catch that negativity and counterbalance it with positive opinions and attitudes, or balance the negativity with positive factual information (if you can find it).  For instance:  Problem: I perceive myself as a poor reader with poor reading comprehension and poor recall, but I have a desire to improve the shit out it.  Process: approach activity> negative attitude comes to mind> realize negative attitude occured> counterbalance with positive attitude> reapproach activity.  This method as far as I've heard really helps changing the attitude, ""I fucking hate [...] activity"" into, ""[...] activity isn't too shitty; it's almost enjoyable [etc.]""  Underlying your motivation (synonymous with want and desire) is your attitude towards some object or activity. In terms of my will to do my reading: my want to read is effected by the attitude towards it.   To elaborate the dynamic between the want and motivation:  The attitude,""I'm not too shitty of an academic reader and this will no doubt make me more of an academic warrior if I do it"" = the some desire to do my academic reading.  VS The attitude: ""I'm a boss at academic reading, and people actively seek me out to replicate my state of bossitude"" = a strong want to do academic reading.  So: use meditation and mindfulness and use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. Added bonus: try to reinforce having done constructive behaviors, having taken positive attitudes and activities.  TL;DR: Sorry not enough want to do it. I fucking tried to make it entertaining, and prose-ey and shit; what more do you want from me? Otherwise, best regards and suck my balls."

But now I want to really dive into why this issue is happening in the first place, not only the needs gaming fulfills (as still have to collab on this!) but also the societal influences, beliefs, mindsets and stigma that all contribute to one of us wanting to/or justifying excessive gaming to ourselves.  Part of that process for me is diving into the intersection of the masculinity crisis with gaming and porn. Phillip Zimbardo thinks it's gaming and porn causing the masculinity crisis. I think the opposite. There's a masculinity crisis that's manifesting in porn and gaming, and then both sides of the spectrum cause the cycle to continue."

StopGaming,37pt0m,MrCopacetic,1 point,Fri May 29 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"Experiential avoidance:       Experiential avoidance (EA) has been broadly defined as attempts to avoid thoughts, feelings, memories, physical sensations, and other internal experiences—even when doing so creates harm in the long-run.  The process of EA is thought to be maintained through negative reinforcement—that is, short-term relief of discomfort is achieved through avoidance, thereby increasing the likelihood that the behavior will persist. Importantly, the current conceptualization of EA suggests that it is not negative thoughts, emotions, and sensations that are problematic, but how one responds to them that can cause difficulties. In particular, a habitual and persistent unwillingness to experience uncomfortable thoughts and feelings (and the associated avoidance and inhibition of these experiences) is thought to be linked to a wide range of problems.

I used to game a lot when I was a kid but for the past several years I haven't spent that much time playing at all. I just used games and other media as escapes and ways to avoid dealing with problems or getting to work, whatever that happened to be (studying, errands, relationship issues, etc).  I bet that you feel fantastic the odd time you've had a productive day, right? When you manage to push past it all and get to work it feels great. Best advice I can give is to remember that feeling and keep striving towards it. I get a hollow reflection of that feeling when I play games or watch Netflix all day. I know it's unsatisfying and ultimately an awful feeling, but it's instantaneous. You get to the good stuff right away without any work. Simply put, I think we have a problem with delayed gratification.  I've been off games for 8 days now. I don't miss them much, but it hasn't changed my life the way I hoped it would. Mainly because I do what you're doing: procrastinating and not working to my full potential.

I've sent a message about this and didn't hear back. :/ Although there is a lack of a sticky for it right now, I do believe there is a lot of great advice being shared by our community within each thread, and I do my best to respond to each as well as I can and there are many solutions to be able to quit and get your life back.  First it's important to know that you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have - and the reason you can keep cycling back into games even if you want to quit is because your needs aren't being met so you go back to what you know - gaming.  If you want to stop there are a few steps you need to take:  Step 1: Read this article on How To Quit Playing Video Games FOREVER.  It will teach you about the needs gaming fulfills and as you can see from the comments, there are many, many people in this movement together. Now that you understand why you play, you want to do the following:  Step 2: Uninstall/Delete your games:  This is to destroy Loss Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy and to create a greater barrier to games.  A few threads of note:   How to get rid of your Steam account in 60 mins.. Permanently. How to quit League of Legends forever StayFocusd Extension (block sites) K9 Web Protection (another site blocker)   Step 3: Choose new activities:  Here is a thread w/ ideas. Make sure you fulfill these three areas with new hobbies:   Mentally Engaging Activity: something that is achievement/skill based. Resting Activity: something you can do at home when you're tired and/or bored. (List of home activities) Social Activity: something to help you make new friends.   Step 4: Setup a daily schedule:  I use Google Calendar and like something that syncs across devices, but experiment and use what works best for you. That could be paper and pen or digital calendar. Try and be out of the house as much as possible where your temptations will be the lowest.  Step 5: Setup your badge:  It helps to see the counter increasing each day and makes it easier for others to support you based on the general place you are at in your journey. When I see someone who's around 5 days it helps me understand what they might potentially be going through, compared to someone who's at 60+ days.  Answers to popular questions I've seen over the past four years:   What If You Find Other Activities To Be Boring? What If Gaming Is The Only Thing You're Good At? What To Do If You Relapse And Start Gaming Again How to Stay Friends With Your Gamer Friends How to Get Motivated After You Quit Gaming Is it ok to play games in moderation?

Is It Normal To Have Dreams and Nightmares About Gaming? How to Make More Friends   Are You A Problematic Gamer or Addict?  I also think it's important to reference this comment, that helps give clarity on the difference between being a problematic gamer and an addict.  For those who identify with addiction and/or are looking for a recovery support group:   Check out the meetings at CGAA. Also it's encouraged to speak with a counsellor to have professional support.

StopGaming,37j0i2,camerondare,5,Thu May 28 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"camerondare has some great tips and strategies! I figured I'd add a few more from the addict perspective...  -Be prepared for withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Knowing what they are helps with remembering that they will subside eventually.  -If you've tried quitting many times and keep relapsing, don't try to do it alone. Whether you're able to find some sort of local support or community or are looking for one online, find the support you need and use it. I got some help from a local intensive outpatient program; it got me to the point of recognizing that my gaming really was a problem and I needed to stop, but no one there really understood gaming addiction. CGAA has helped me get from there to get to the point I am now. The combination of meetings, many phone calls, and the recovery program has let me connect with other addicts and learn and take hope from their experiences.  -For addicts, the pain we've been using gaming to numb comes to the surface when we stop. It's one of the reasons why trying to quit alone is so hard (if not impossible). For me, that's meant that depression and anxiety have been a lot worse than they were when gaming. And I flip between feeling empty and flooded with emotions I'd much rather bury (but know I shouldn't). Expecting that has helped me not use it as an excuse to go back to gaming.  -Start to recognize the ""addict voice"" that finds all sorts of clever ways to try to talk you into going back to gaming."

Go to www.mediafire.com/dailyreprieve  Choose the folder ""AA Recordings"" (this is NOT an AA talk, it's a medical talk for non-medical people given at an AA conference).  In there you will find the folder ""Disease Model of Addiction.""  It's two one-hour mp3's, easily downloaded.

I could write a faq that would answer every question in 99% of the posts, but then what would people post about?  I don't want people responding to people looking for help with ""read the faq.""  When most gaming addicts quit, they suddenly have to fill upwards of 40 hours of newly found freetime. Filling that free time is one of the hardest parts of quitting. Digging into the subreddit for the information they desire is a good timesuck.  Obviously, some people disagree with this stance, but those are the reasons why it's not here."

People could respond with their personal experiences and encouragement, though, and let people read the faq for a summary of strategies for quitting.  When you're first going through withdrawal is not the ideal time for trying to dig through looking for good information. And there's people with trouble with internet addiction as well where clicking around hunting for info isn't particularly good for them.  You've probably heard those thoughts before, but I figured I'd say them as well."

Our sub shares many similarities to /r/NoFap, and looking to how they've managed to grow their community and in doing so, been able to help more people in the world who struggle and need help, we can look at them as a great example to model.  They do a great job in their sidebar of providing valuable information (as /u/Orchid011) suggests, while encouraging others to introduce themselves and find an accountability partner (getting them involved posting in the sub.)  Maybe we could work on doing something similar here. When you go on NoFap you feel a sense of professionalism about the sub that encourages users to get engaged. It would benefit this sub to give off a similar feel, especially as many here are frustrated that society isn't taking our movement seriously.  I'd be happy to help put this together in whatever capacity as I know you are busy.  Regardless of what you decide for the above, is it possible to have an alternative to CGAA in the sidebar? CGAA is great for those who identify with being an addict but there is a large % of those who come into this sub (many of whom are under 18) who would be classified as a problematic user rather than an addict. Offering an alternative would be helpful for these to feel more comfortable and understood.  Hope you're having a good day. Thanks for all your work bringing the sub to this point so far."

As far as addiction goes, there are two types: chemical and process. Porn and gaming addictions go hand in hand as they are both process addictions. Here's some introductory reading for you so you know what you're possibly battling against!  It will take some time to analyze the extent at which your gaming damages your life. By the time I decided to quit, I was much older and the gaming was taking over my job and relationship. Since quitting, I'm using the reserve energy from not playing and pouring it into work, hobbies, and my marriage.  If you can gain control of your time management at the age of 21, you are opening up so many doors. Sell whatever gaming stuff you can and give away the rest. I would also suggest telling the people you love and trust that you are quitting so they understand that you're making a lifestyle choice.  You have help here if you want it!

You could always have a friend or family member change the password (and the recovery capabilities) for the time being until you have a better handle on your life. Hopefully the friend you want to give it to would be good to tell about your situation so they know you can't have that account back. I know how hard it is to open up about this to people because you feel like they might not understand. I was lucky to have my fiancé to talk to.

Perhaps you can sell or trade the graphics card for something minimal. You don't have to damage the items you own. It's not your fault or the computer's fault that you can't play games right now. With that being said, it's important to provide yourself a safe haven from all things gaming. Even with that, you'll still run into temptation and natural urges to play over time.

One thing that I have found works pretty well is to prioritize fulfilling needs lower on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  I found that I was replacing things like sleep, food, and social interaction with my games. The simplest cure is to get your bases covered. Eat enough, sleep enough, and at least try to spend more time with your friends in person. Although it may not subside, your compulsion will waver. Finally, in the case of your account, just understand that you aren't getting the money back by playing it, and justifying addiction through the notion of ""getting my money's worth"" is called the sunk cost fallacy."

While it may not be as destructive as drug addictions, eating disorders or gambling addictions, it is still incredibly hard to gain control of your life.  Like anything, you admitted you have a problem and can't manage your life because of your addiction to video games. You admitted it anonymously to perfect strangers. Perhaps it's time to admit it to someone you love and trust in your family or circle of close friends.  There is no shame in asking for help or admitting you have a problem. It takes a lot of courage to do so, more than you realize. The majority of people would rather stay in denial or let their addictions rule over their lives.

In my case, I've been getting treatment for depression/anxiety for many years - therapy, medication, support groups, etc. Unfortunately, I have what gets labeled ""treatment resistant depression,"" meaning that no combination of all that stuff has been able to make it go away altogether. It's definitely made it much harder to stop gaming since gaming was helping to keep the depression from getting worse, but gaming also prevented the depression from getting better so hopefully without it eventually the depression will lift a little more."

StopGaming,37f0e5,M3rlino,5,Wed May 27 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"Hey! This can definitely be a tricky situation. The important thing to remember is that gaming is just fulfilling certain needs he has (the need to escape is one), so it's less that he really wants to play and more that it's fulfilling things for him.  So to help him move on, you need to help him fulfill those needs in other things. If he needs to decompress from the day, that would be a good place to start. How else could he decompress? Finding a way to do that together would be good.  Next, being out of the house is always a + because then he won't be as tempted to play.  What I see is a similar situation to why most teenagers play games.  They wake up and go to school and fulfill their ""obligations"" for the day, so now they have free time and it's one of the first times they actually get to CHOOSE what to do with their time all day, so they choose gaming (they need to decompress after spending the whole day forcing themselves to do their obligations.)  This situation is really no different, just substitute work and school. He gets up and goes to work, and picks up his son and fulfills his obligations. So when he has free time he wants to do what he wants with it, which is gaming.  So you also need to try and find a way (ideally together) to start making other decisions about how to spend your time. And keep them away from being obligations and more about living your life and enjoying it. Part of this is about breaking through Loss Aversion theory.  If you want to understand more about gaming, why we play and what tends to work to move on, the videos on my channel will help a lot."

Most studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.  Loss aversion was first demonstrated by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.   This leads to risk aversion when people evaluate an outcome comprising similar gains and losses; since people prefer avoiding losses to making gains.

It's an opportunity to fantasize and adventure. Games are nearly constantly mentally stimulating, they offer measurable growth. They are somewhat consistent. They offer challenge. They can be social.

Whether it is carpal tunnel or the more likely brachial nerve entrapment stretching is the cure. There are three excellent ones.  https://youtu.be/Z4aXRj0uIj4  Also look up chest stretches.

Due to this a return to moderation in some sense and/or the possibility of being able to moderate their play at some point in the future (the ETA on this is relative and TBD for each person, it could be < 90 days, or significantly longer, even years.

I just try and move the conversation into a more productive/positive direction when I have the opportunity to."

StopGaming,37bdpb,camerondare,3,Wed May 27 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"I don't have any sort of formal definition of the two, but LearningSerenity's comment to this post was helpful to me for differentiating between the two. Short of some sort of neuroimaging test (which doesn't currently exist) which would identify whether the the brain activity common to addicts is there, it seems like one of the ways of differentiating is what happens when people try to stop. With effort, problem gamers are able to stop and after a period of withdrawal, things get better. For addicts, trying to stop is much more difficult and stopping brings out all the underlying problems behind the addiction.  It's an interesting question. Maybe later I'll start a post to see the experiences of people who consider themselves one or the other."

StopGaming,37bdpb,veydar_,2,Wed May 27 07:10:31 2015 UTC,"The big challenge here is that there is no universally accepted definition of addiction.  You have your DSM diagnoses (which recently changed with the shift from edition IV to V), ICD, various independent addiction screening tools etc etc and depending on how you approach it you come up with different answers.  In general, across multiple systems of diagnosis, two factors tend to separate problematic behaviour from addiction - the presence of withdrawal symptoms and reduced control (i.e. unsuccessful attempts to quit or moderate).  In my experience, this is a useful and generally helpful rule of thumb (are those two factors present) but in reality, it's a pretty wide continuum from high engagement through problematic behaviour through to full blow addiction.  Working as a therapist who has specialised in addictions, I've worked with a great many addicts and a great many problematic users of drugs, alcohol, gambling, games etc.  In my experience, there is absolutely no 'one-size-fits-all' approach either for problematic users or addicts.  Some addicts can moderate their usage (though often not without external help), some cannot.  Some addicts do well in abstinence-based programmes, some do not.  It really comes down to the individual and the way that their addiction fits within the greater context of their lives - including all the other biological, social and psychological drivers.  As for myself, I considered myself to be addicted to gaming because of the factors I mentioned above.  At the time I was addicted, I could not control my gaming without help, and I experienced pretty severe withdrawal symptoms when I was not gaming.  However, in contrast to some people's views of addiction, I now consider myself recovered from addiction, since I have not gamed in an addictive way in over 10 years, and am able to play in moderation.  That's just my view though based on my personal and clinical experience.  Others will obviously see things differently.  To look at it from a simplistic diagnostic perspective, I met the criteria for addiction well and truly ten years ago, and now I do not."

The difference can vary from person to person. For me, this way of moderation is working right now, which isn't a 100% guarantee I would never fall again, but I'm convinced the mentallity I have right now is helping me to never come back to playing MMORPG's and other addicting games like LoL. I am satisfied to play daily, If I want too (which means I could don't play that day) with my 15 minutes of TableTennis playing. I am tracking time to feel safe and sure I'm doing it right, since I'm beginning and no one I know has been tracking moderation...

I think getting a job would be a great first step...you would get instant social interaction, money, and purpose.  As to the rest of it? I dunno man. Gaming addiction is a real thing and can cause depression, but you actually do have things to be blue about so who knows.  Somehow or another you gotta find a way to get to your head right with the world. It starts with a reason to get up. A reason to shower. It blossoms when you put yourself out there and try your best. I once read that ""lucky"" people arent luckier. They just create situations for themselves by constantly capitalizing on every  oppoturnity, even where most people wouldnt see opportunity at all.  You have a car. You have the internet. Ok. That isnt nothing. Now. Time to find a job. For now any job. No matter what it is it will be one more addition onto the list of things you have.   From there who knows? Maybe you get promoted. Maybe you find love. Maybe you pay for some community college class...and then that opens up even more chances, more people. Maybe you do well and get a scholarship to an undergrad program..  My advice? Take it slow and come to peace with your life. That doesnt mean you have to be happy. You just gotta come to terms with it. Video games can only hurt your ambition at this point. Then make some goals. Make a plan. From here on out you are a level one under dog on hard mode in the game of life. You dont enter those RPGs a god...it starts slowly. One quest here...an item  there...companions met, and ways opened. Let your time in video games teach you that. Now apply it to your life. Happy leveling.  Go be brilliant."

Shit we're all human's imagine if we came into consciousness as a chicken or something; while they may not have the ability to cognitively realize how shitty things are I have to imagine that's a pretty shit life relatively...  Hell, I was born into a middle class American family; I am white, male, tall, fairly attractive, fairly healthy (mentally and physically), have married parents and was born in the current era (with all the awesome as fuck technology and daily comforts relative to other eras in time). I'm lucky as fuck, all that shit was luck of the draw (more or less). I also haven't fit in all that well at any one time in my life; but hey how much awesomeness can you ask for from lady luck? Perhaps that perspective will cheer you up. If not, I tried.  Also, I think it's only natural that to fall into something like addictive video games to escape for just about anyone if they hear, ""you are going to die and we can't do anything about it"" from the docs. So, I think you are being way too hard on yourself by likening yourself to a child for your gaming.  I would think some people care about you; so that may be too hard on them. Try not to get mad at people trying to help you, no one is perfect. If you want; get mad at the universe, God(s), lady luck, etc. that's fair enough I suppose.   I hope you can realize some sort of happiness in the time you've got left even if it's fleeting; I wish every conscious being could get their equal share of happiness and choose how it's doled out.

The main cause of addiction (according to some) is pain and stress that we somehow can't manage.  When I stopped, the monsters came out from under the bed and starting growling.  And what made it worse is that gaming addiction had flattened life for me--it took away all interest or pleasure I had in anything else.  So I was in bad shape for a while. Things can get better, for sure.  But, it took me some time to begin enjoying other things.  Then, I had to deal with the pain and stress that was threatening to push me back into the addiction, even though my withdrawal symptoms had receded. If you haven't seen a list of common withdrawal symptoms, check out the link.  And like Cam said, you don't need to do this alone.  Come here and read and post, and if you want even more interaction with people, come to some meetings.  You can make connections with people there.  It was meetings and connections with people that kept me off games during the first months, which were hard for me.  Some people have an easier time than others.

For example, first thing in the morning & before you've gotten out of bed: The first opportunity to use your computer in the day. While eating food: You get home, eat some food, watch videos. In bed: You go to your bed to rest, then use your computer.   That doesn't mean you won't use your computer just as much if you delay the initial use past the very first opportunity.

StopGaming,3743j1,RobbingWilliams,6,Sun May 24 18:17:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting, this is a very interesting link and discussion to have. I think that this approach is really dependent on the person and their history with gaming addiction. I'm not sure that you'll find many people here who would endorse the moderation approach - many of us have tried and failed.  My brain doesn't work with gaming moderation at all. For me, it's just a gateway to a relapse, and an all-too-easy excuse to return to my old habits. I had myself convinced that I could moderate myself for many years before I got to this point.  Abstinence was definitely hard for me to reconcile at first. The thought of not playing games ever again was not a pleasant one, given it had been such a core part of my life. However, my experience with abstinence so far has been a really pleasant one. For me, the core to a cold-turkey quit has been replacing gaming with activities that I find fun, engaging, productive, and easy to do (i.e. activities that are themselves not a willpower challenge). So far so good - I can honestly say I haven't had a single craving to return to games. Whether or not I eventually return to playing in moderation will depend on whether I see any value in doing so. If I continue on the track I'm on now, I don't think I ever will."
StopGaming,3743j1,CamCan,6,Sun May 24 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"For me I try to stay away from the conversation about moderation vs. abstinence because for me it's never been about that. Also I recognize that this isn't the case for everybody, but for me when you focus too much on moderation vs. abstinence it's easy to miss the point and that's that this has never really been about games in the first place.  Games are just the activity, the way to fulfill needs you have that are being unmet otherwise. It's not that gaming is good or bad, it's just that it's been your way to fulfill your unmet needs. Because of this (and the structural brain changes that occur) the amount you actually enjoy gaming is likely exaggerated.  Because of these structural changes to your brain, that involve:   Numbed pleasure response: every day activities no longer satisfy you Hyper-reactivity to gaming: gaming is AMAZING and everything else is boring Willpower erosion: due to changes to your prefrontal cortex   It's recommended you go through a 90 day detox abstaining from games before approaching moderation. Give yourself the opportunity to experience life without gaming, because prior to this your judgement is, unfortunately, clouded in many different emotions:   Your brain is still wired to want gaming, so that influences your decisions, Your emotions and anxiety are high due to your identity being tied to gaming, so that influences your decisions your scared and afraid about what life would look like without games, and makes you vulnerable and influences your decisions   I do agree that there is a stigma against gaming, however gaming is not like reading fiction because fiction does not have the dopamine overload that games are designed to induce. Poker can be similar to gaming, but that's probably a bad parallel to draw because of how prominent gambling addiction is.  And again, if we talk about ""gaming is no different than fiction or poker"" I believe we are focusing on the wrong aspects of the discussion, which is really that gaming has contributed in whatever way it has to you coming to a place in your life (I don't mean you, I mean anybody) where although you had (or have) fun playing games... they aren't necessarily making you happy. And that there exists a world outside of games that can be absolutely incredible too.  But gaming is a way for you to avoid pursuing that, because gaming fulfills your needs and is such an integral piece of your identity and environment. So it can easily become a crutch. Whereas when you remove games you create the opportunity to face the situation as it is, instead of masking it with games. Again, this was my own experience and I can only speak to that.  One of the reasons why those in this sub who are under 22(ish) may have trouble ""moderating"" is because the cortex in your brain doesn't fully form until your early twenties, and your cortex is responsible for self-control.  Overall, I just mean to say, there's more to the discussion than just moderation vs. abstinence, and especially when it comes to alcoholism and addiction in general, I think the environmental factors are often discussed far too little, and much more emphasis is constantly put on the actual ""substance"" being addictive, instead of what's more accurate which is the substance tends to only be addictive when certain environment factors have led to an individual being vulnerable to addiction.

StopGaming,3743j1,camerondare,2,Mon May 25 04:26:58 2015 UTC,This post. This is a good post.
StopGaming,3743j1,wellAlbidarned,3,Mon May 25 06:23:22 2015 UTC,"I think it is important that these things are discussed, as particularly in addiction treatment my experience has been that few clinicians know how to effectively help people to moderate.  It goes without saying that different people require different interventions, and that for some people attempting to moderate (particularly early in treatment) may not be helpful at all.  However, the problem I've come across is that with those people for whom moderation would be helpful, few clinicians seem clear on how to support this to happen.  As most people here likely know, generally attempts to self-moderate are unsuccessful - and the risk here is that the idea of moderation is thrown out altogether.  That said, for many people, just because they cannot easily self moderate it does not mean they cannot learn to moderate at all.  This generally requires a more nuanced understanding of the drivers that are perpetuating the addiction so that moderating processes can be put in place to mitigate these, and a good clinician ought to be able to facilitate this.  From my own experience, I had a pretty substantial gaming addiction - playing around 16 hours per day for two years.  That was 10 years ago now, and there was very little support for gaming addiction that I could find at that point.  Now I am able to moderate my gaming.  I wasn't at the time.  Of course, my experience will not match other's necessarily, but I've seen both from my own experience and from working now as an addictions clinician for some time that there are people who can (with support) learn to moderate their addictions, and there are those who cannot - and it's not always possible to tell which is which from the severity or intensity of the addiction, only through trial and error.  I think it's great that it appears many people here have been able to identify for themselves whether or not abstinence is the best approach which I think is as it should be - no-one can know better than ourselves what is likely to work for each of us."
StopGaming,3743j1,Anthro-Apologist,2,Sun May 24 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting bits:   After going through Alternative's program and reintroducing alcohol into their lives, some people realize that they cannot manage a life of moderate drinking and end up choosing abstinence. Jaffe says having the experience of making that choice helps these people stay committed to their treatment.       And    He believes that recovery should be measured by improvement in a person's quality of life, not simply whether they've stopped drinking.      And     But in certain cases, he suggests, it may be a viable option. ""A good candidate for moderation shouldn't have a significant physical dependence,"" Horvath says. ""They should have a supportive social network, and be socially stable (i.e. employed, family, home life)."""
StopGaming,3743j1,Scott3611,2,Sun May 24 18:18:11 2015 UTC,"moderation is too many times overlooked.   I've never known a single person who had a problem with too much games, drugs or alcohol whose immediate thought wasn't to moderate.  You're saying there are people who don't ever think to game less?  Who never once even try it?  Who think it has got to be 30-60 hours per week or zero?  And that this happens ""too many times""?  Do you even know one person like this?"
StopGaming,3743j1,camerondare,1 point,Sun May 24 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"The occasion where moderation would be good is when your friends and family are all partaking in activities that are the source of this addiction, for example drinking, if you drink in family occasions and with friends without heavily drinking on your own, you can moderate your drinking and it might be easier than stop drinking completely at the cost of your social relationships. It´s the successful ""Social drinking"".      I do know some guys who play for years various games, but they can conciliate it with their normal lives, one example that comes to mind is a guy that is married and works as an engineer, his past-time hobby is playing with his real life friends.    Instead of playing soccer or volleyball(these activities are better because they are physical), he plays with his friends, can´t you see how this can be a moderate kind of gaming behavior?     The problem most addicts suffer is substance abuse tied with isolation."

Exactly, just because it's what your friends are doing it doesn't mean you need to continue to go down the same path. Something that you learn as life goes on is that so do your friends. It doesn't mean you need to ditch them, but people grow apart and go in different directions. You are allowed to have many different friends over your life.  What I recommend is to find new ways to interact with your friends if you want (outside of games) but also work on finding new ones. Here's a video where I talk about that.  Also, when you tend to relapse it's an opportunity to learn from your mistakes. So like you said, you relapsed when you were feeling bored, which happens for two reasons:   You're just sitting around with nothing to do. You haven't decided what ""else"" to do.   So you need to find new hobbies (if you need ideas go here.), and you need to schedule your time so you aren't sitting around. Also try to be out of the house that helps.  Relapse can teach us a lot.

So first of all, you have to respect yourself in order to gain the respect of others. So forgive yourself for time lost (unless you have a time machine), and accept that you have the present moment to work with.  In this moment, you can put your time and energy towards anything and everything. Given that infinite choice, and your desire for self-improvement: - What are some things you know you need to work on, but haven't yet? - What are some things you know you want to work on, but haven't yet? - What overlap exists between the two?  After giving yourself the answers to those questions, form small, concrete goals that you can work towards. Don't try to tackle everything at once; instead, focus on building one new habit at a time. In reality, you aren't working on any of those things, you're just practicing the art of making new and healthy habits.  And don't sell yourself short. You may feel, at times, that you don't have anything to offer women, but there's a part of you that knows that isn't true. Why else would you be posting if you didn't believe change is possible?  You've got this. If you find yourself hitting roadblocks, work on any of the things you may have answered to the previous questions.

Here's the truth:  My first breakup I used gaming to distract myself for a year and a half. I may have been able to avoid feeling the emotions of the breakup but it took me years to truly recover.  My second breakup I didn't use gaming and although it was hard at first, because I actually focused on processing the breakup and working through my emotions, I've grown leaps and bounds because of it.  So I definitely recommend processing the breakup, even though it's hard.  Here are a few tips:   Schedule your day. Even just one hour at a time, it's important to know what you're doing. Have an intentional morning routine. Use this. When you're feeling anxious or stressed, Use Meditation. Here's the science behind it. To get started use Headspace's 10 day challenge (it's free). Do a gratitude journal each morning. Watch this video for how to do it. (midway through I talk about it.) Anytime you need to shift your state, just write down 10 things you're grateful for. This will be an easy way to focus on what you have instead of what you don't.   I also have a video on how to deal with cravings that will help.  Gaming has always been our way of dealing with emotions or stress in our life. It's our way of checking out. So to successfully move on we need to find a new way of doing this. Hope the above helps. You're not alone and you've made it to 112 days, that's a big accomplishment so be proud of yourself. :)  Also make sure you're exercising daily. You can use the Scientific 7-Minute Workout if you need something quick! It's also available on the web here."

Depending on when you started to game part of why it can be happening is simply because you haven't ever really had any other hobbies or passions outside of gaming, so your ""skill"" of being able to find new ways to engage in the world is weak, which is a muscle you need to build now moving forward.  The best thing I've found is a schedule to focus one hour at a time. If I schedule different hobbies in that helps. It also helps to turn something into a project. For me I started learning how to DJ and then committed to putting out one new podcast episode per month. To put that together took between 20-40 hours of work each month, so now I had something more meaningful to spend my time on that left me fulfilled instead of frustrated."

The obsessive compulsive behavior that drives an addict to play the game at any cost is the problem.  I joined a program of recovery to deal with my addict brain, not the tools of my escapism.

I certainly do think that some games are more harmful than others, as they press the right buttons within us. I find adventure games, puzzles (without monetisation) or story-based RPGs are less likely to fit an addiction model.

How is this relevant to your post? Well, in the scenario I described people were simply lying or stating what they considered a fact when it was really just a vague assumption. Bottom line: Don't trust people and their perception! (hyperbole)  If you leave r/stopgaming and ask people about the addictive potential of games, I'd guess that at least 50% of the replies will be ""We play because it's fun, what's wrong with that?!"". I firmly believe (and science backs this up to a certain degree) that for a lot of people it's hard to tell apart fun and compulsion (or addiction). I am pretty sure that losing money isn't fun and yet millions of people gamble day after day. I can't really imagine drug abuse being fun and yet there's an entire branch of medicine that's about treating drug abuse.   What you are feeling is exactly the same I often have. I read about a game and envision playing it in my head. It seems sooo much fun! And when I actually buy it or play it it's just dull. Suddenly, I have no idea whatsoever what made me install/buy/play this crap and yet here I am.   You are craving games for reasons I can only guess. Maybe it's about the feeling of progression that leveling up gives you, the anticipation of joy (not actual joy!) before you open a box of loot, the feeling of superiority after a penta that won the game, the sense of achievement upon 100%ing a game on steam whatever! It's just important to remind yourself that, as someone who is addicted to games, you can't trust your brain. There are optical illusions (we all know those) just like there are other kinds of illusions (we often overlook them).    But it never is. I feel like I am scared to let gaming go because of how much it meant to me in the past.   I have the same thing! Cruel as it sounds, should you decide to quit gaming the first few weeks are going to be hard. Everything else will feel dull and games will seem like the only thing worth doing. But trust me on this, it does get better. After days, weeks or months your brain will rebalance and you're going to realize that, what games used to give you, can be found in real life too. But in real life it comes with a lot of perks, namely that it's not just bits on a server that are worth nothing once the game is shut down, but rather skills, experiences and/or abilities that your real life avatar now possesses."

I decided I would collect everything on the map and go to every map icon and I did. It wasn't fun exactly, but I loved how I felt when I got closer and closer to 100%. Once I hit 100% it didn't feel great. I just loved that I could now get a new game to do it all over again, and I loved the anticipation of getting there, which you touched on.   A lot of my ""favourite games"" are games where I had to collect things and I've actually described to people that I enjoy games that are basically ""interactive check-lists"". I love doing things simply to cross them off a list so I have a list with 100% of the things crossed off. When a game is too hard for me, or if I get lost, need to ask for help etc. I give up. That's how I determine if I like a game or not. If I can't figure out how to cross off the next thing on the list I get frustrated and give up, and then buy a new game (a new list) hoping I'll be able to cross it all off. Rinse and repeat."

Dopamine is at the center of why we love to game so much.  What you speak of is called Tolerance.

Only that it's a side effect of addiction -> you need more to fill the same ""fix"" you want.  I'm sure you're experiencing that to some degree (again, I'm not a doctor and can only share my perspective), but you're also missing out on the level of stimulation (dopamine) you were getting from games, so it's important to find that in new activities.

I tried to play at one point just to experience gaming again (I had lost touch with it) and after a few days I could feel how it really wasn't good for me in the long run.  It's easy to want to go back to games even after a 90 day detox if you haven't found new projects and goals you're investing time on.  Sometimes when we quit we're able to move on simply by NOT playing games. This is different than actually building a new life without gaming. I talk about that here. Gaming is what you know, and by no means am I against moderation, I just want to share the full perspective.  Keep us posted! :)"
StopGaming,36whyq,camerondare,2,Sat May 23 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"I'm doing exactly the same as you with moderation. This is my second day of trying moderation, but I don't really know if your ""moderation"" is like mine or if you will be priorizing responsibilities like me.   I will explain my model: my moderation consist on investing more time on other activities than gaming (If I have free time), as, if I have a few hobbies, like for example lets say origami, I will track the time I do origami and will try to do more origami than gaming that day (this way, I will augment the amount of time I do other hobbies and control the gaming sessions to 1 hour/day at max (which has been said by some scientific articles to be the maximum healthy time). Yesterday, I focused on other hobbies and gamed for 38 minutes, so this system is working to me, and I think if I get used to it, I will end don't needing a time tracking app to game.   BUT, and here comes the best part, if I have a real responsibility on the way (like, let's say, a payed-job or a homework) I will ban gaming until I have done that work.   Hope somewhat of what I'm doing is useful to anyone.  In the meantime, I've created a subr (which no one knows by now) http://www.reddit.com/r/LimitGaming/ take a look if you want.

Good luck on whatever you decide to do!   To me gaming was not the problem. It was what I chose to do with the games that were the problems. Every time something bad happened to me in real life, I would run to games and forget about it. The problems were never solved, they were delayed. So rememeber not to repeat my mistakes. Play games when you are HAPPY, not when you are sad/angry/depressed. Play games when all things in your life is finished and solved. If you don't, all your problems will still be there when you come back."

Games are designed in specific ways and because of that, the type of stimulation (dopamine surges -> dopamine overload) is very difficult to get in one activity. Games are artificial, so it's hard to replicate organically.  Now that doesn't mean other activities aren't just as much fun or more fulfilling, it's just different. Here's a video where I talk more about the science behind this and what to do about it. I'd also recommend watching this video for more of an in-depth analysis.   Cravings   Cravings are normal and it's important to develop practical ways to dance with them when they happen. One of the best ways is using Meditation. Here's the science behind it. Starting a daily meditation practice will help your cravings a lot. To start use the Headspace 10-day challenge. It's free and you can access it on the web or your smartphone.  Hope that helps.

StopGaming,36wxbp,Procrastinatortater,3,Fri May 22 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"For people (like me) who have the full-blown disease of addiction, the brain has undergone some significant changes from a ""normal"" brain.  One of those changes makes it so we relate to the focus of the addiction in much the same way as people relate to significant others.  It's a genuine love relationship as far as the brain chemistry is concerned, it just happens to be a super toxic love relationship where investing time and money into the relationship harms me and everybody around me.  Oh yeah...and it carries a serious compulsion to invest as much time and money as possible into the addiction...and extreme difficulty in recognizing just how bad things have gotten.  Some people can moderate, but I'm not one of them.  I'm an addict, and moderation of my addictive gaming is impossible for me to achieve for any length of time.  Because I'm one of the ones who can't moderate (and believe me, I tried), I'm never going to recommend it to anybody.  By the time people show up on a place like this one, it's usually after they've already tried moderation several times and failed.  The biggest thing that has worked for me is getting involved in a 12-Step recovery fellowship focused on gaming addiction.  You can check out the fellowship I'm part of here if you're interested.  Meetings have been a tremendous help to me, and getting a sponsor and actually working the steps with his help remains one of the best decisions I've ever made.  Hope things go well for you."

I think if you ask the people on here who ""constantly push for"" moderation, you will find that the majority of them agree with you that moderation doesn't always work.

Many of us relate to gaming being an integral part of our lives growing up, and then coming to a moment as you are now where we recognize that maybe continuing to live our life like this moving forward isn't really what we want to do. That doesn't mean gaming hasn't been fun, or it hasn't meant something to us... just that we've decided it's not making us happy anymore and we want something else. There's a difference between having fun (playing games) and being happy and fulfilled.  It's important to know that you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have. So it's about making sure to find new activities that fulfill the same needs gaming did.  Something you might be interested in is that research shows us we can experience structural brain changes due to our excessive gaming... and to recover from this it may take up to 90 days for our brain to rewire back to normal sensitivity levels.

Some of us really are addicted, really have the mental condition of addiction.  I liked gaming too.  Loved it.  I thought that was why I was so obsessive and compulsive about it.  But over time, I was suffering big problems like you're talking about, neglecting all the most important things in life.  And for what?  Most of the games I played had become a grind, long boring frustrated stretches punctuated by occasional highs.  So I decided to cut back, and soon enough was gaming as much as ever.  So I tried again, and soon enough was gaming MORE than ever.  So I tried stopping completely, but still kept going back to it, gaming as much as ever, and suffering all the same problems, except feeling really down on myself for not sticking to my promises.  My obsession and compulsion are part of a mental condition, called addiction for lack of a better word.  Addiction is a progressive illness, such as I experienced.  Moderation isn't possible, as I found out.  Recovery methods that work with other addictions also work with gaming addiction.  Ever since I got serious about recovery in CGAA, I have been off games completely.  The time I used to spend gaming is now spent on that ""most important things in life"" stuff.  I feel good about myself, I sleep well, I take care of myself, I do what I say I will, I have hobbies again, I exercise, I work, I'm more honest, I pay attention to the people who matter to me."

StopGaming,36r0xb,veydar_,3,Fri May 22 00:59:52 2015 UTC,"For years you overstimulated your brain, which resulted in frequent (too frequent!) dopamine bursts. These dopamine bursts then lead to the accumulation of a protein called ""fos b"", which subsequently turned into ""delta fos b"". This little protein is now sitting in your brain, in lots of nerves (simplification!) and it is what you'd expect to see in the brain of any addict. Whether that person was or is addicted to a substance or a behaviour isn't relevant, what's relevant is that ""delta fos b"" will always be there. It's believed to be a ""molecular switch"" for the state of addiction.  Now why would you want to go through the ordeal of abstinence? So your body or in this case your brain can slowly but steadily get rid of ""delta fos b"". Unfortunately, this process takes time.  Can you guess what is going to happen if you break the streak and surrender to the urge? Well, you'll be working on that mountain of ""delta fos b"" Bob the Builder style. So do yourself a favor and don't :)"
StopGaming,36r0xb,veydar_,2,Thu May 21 16:14:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'd never heard of fos b and delta fos b. But I find the explanation helpful. It's easy to get really caught up in the desire of the moment, in the rationalizations, so that they seem like an ""affect permanence"". In other words, it's difficult to imagine feeling differently, and reducing the feelings to a chemical substrate helps me disassociate from them. If what I'm feeling is just a predictable and measurable consequence of addiction, I can ignore it. These cravings are in a way my body fighting to preserve the status quo, and I need to have faith that I will feel totally different given enough time."

Does fos b/delta fos b act as a sort of catalyst to increase dopamine uptake in the brain or something?  Again, this is the first time I've ever heard of this."
StopGaming,36r0xb,zbud,2,Thu May 21 18:19:05 2015 UTC,"It's of course way more complicated than that. See the following (one of many) research paper. If you need help with specifics, let me know.

StopGaming,36r0xb,veydar_,2,Thu May 21 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"Woof, that's a lot of new terminology. I think I'd need to have some background in neuroscience for this to be accessible. Thanks regardless."
StopGaming,36r0xb,zbud,4,Thu May 21 19:13:56 2015 UTC,"Haha alright, let me try to sum it up in a more accessible way:  You play a video game and as you are anticipating a reward (e.g. level up) your brain will release dopamine, to motivate you to work for that reward. This dopamine will be released from the ending of one nerve, traverse the space between two nerve endings (""synaptic cleft"") and then activate receptors on the end of the other nerve. This will initiate a signaling cascade at the end of which FosB levels, in the recipient nerve, will increase.   Dopamine will quickly leave the synaptic cleft, the signaling cascade will cease to be active and FosB levels will just as rapidly decline.   Now problems start to arise if (or shall I say when) the frequency and intensity of the dopamine bursts exceeds physiological (= normal) levels. In that case, FosB will reach high concentrations, which will cause certain enzymes to truncate FosB into Delta FosB. Without going into too much detail, delta FosB - as opposed to FosB - is very stable. When FosB levels decline after seconds to minutes, delta FosB can remain elevated for weeks to months.   What delta FosB does I can't tell, at least not exactly, because even for someone who went through med school this kind of information is more than I deem relevant to the cause. But delta FosB will lead to structual changes in the brain (""neuro plasticity""). This could e.g. activate or disable certain genes, regulate transmitter uptake and influence mechanisms that I can't even spell properly. For you this means that FosB can increase your impulsivity or increase cravings. But as a general rule, making the mental leap from ""we observed structural changes in the brain"" to ""we think we can explain certain behaviours"" is really a long shot.   But there exists a lot of evidence that supports the theory that delta FosB is the switch that keeps you addicted. It'll keep you craving for games (and stimuli), it might make everything seem boring and whatnot. It's not the sole cause, obviously, but it plays an important role.   At the end of the day, what this means to you, is this:   Behavioural addictions are a thing, you're not weak or feeble and no you can't just ""toughen up"" and give up games Abstinence is important to ""rebalance"" your brain, for a lack of a better term"
StopGaming,36r0xb,veydar_,1 point,Thu May 21 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"Awww Med school; that explains your esoteric knowledge. The farthest I went for science was intro to comp sci and non calc physics otherwise I just have a humanities and architectural background . I assume your avg person, having gone through med school, would likely not know this much about neuroscience; unless they specialized.  Anyways, that's a very good ELI5; well done. So I'm guessing you were/are addicted to VGs as well. If so how's it going?"
StopGaming,36r0xb,zbud,2,Thu May 21 21:50:34 2015 UTC,"I was always drawn to fantasy, games and escapism. Due to a variety of reasons (chief among them my frustration with real life and academia) - although I had largely abandoned gaming during uni - I started to play more and more in 2013 and by 2014 this had turned into a full blown addiction.   I did what I always do in these situations: I consulted science and devoured the available literature.   Interestingly, even though I often advise people to quit gaming ""cold turkey"" for a while, I myself didn't actually do that. My situation is a bit peculiar though. None (literally none!) of my real life friends is a gamer, including my girlfriend. So whenever I hang out with them or with my GF, no one ever talks about games. Furthermore, I have regular 40h work week plus about 2,5h of commuting everyday. The result is that, even if I spent every second of my spare time playing games, it would still pale in comparison to the 15h binge session I frequently had in '14. Additionally, my addiction lasted for about a year and a half and (luckily) it didn't ruin anything. I still passed my finals, I am still in a stable relationship and I did get a modicum of exercise. So all in all my situation wasn't as dire as it could have been which is probably a very important reason why I can successfully moderate my gaming.  Concrete examples? I am using HabitRPG to keep track (and a sense of constant progression) of my real life but here are a few ""key"" ingredients that work for me:   Get 7h of sleep and don't use the snooze button. Ever. This is not negotiable. Nothing kills willpower and discipline as sleep deprivation does. Really, you may think you can function on 5 or 6 hours of sleep but statistis say that it's really really unlikely. And if you're on this subreddit you can't really afford to take chances, so get enough sleep! Meditation. Sounds weird coming from a self proclaimed science lover? Not at all! Think of your brain as a muscle. Instead of lifting weights, you meditate. Sit down and try to focus on your breathing without letting yourself get distracted. Your ""willpower muscle"" (= brain) will grow stronger! NoFap ... to be honest, NoFap was key to finding out about FosB and the science behind addiction. It's just another willpower exercise Everytime you want to play a game ask yourself:""Why do I want to play right now?"" And be honest. 99% of the time people say ""because it's fun"" but is it? I often play because I am simply bored and games are convenient. Or because I feel obligated to farm and keep up with the game economy. Or because I need to 100% this game or finish it or whatever. But if you don't truly enjoy it and derive pleasure from it, just don't. I actually ended up deleting everygame I didn't enjoy.  Find other activities. This is the hardest part for me. Suggest gardening or knitting and I will a) actually be rolling on the floor laughing or b) see under a). I need challenges and progress and a reason to do things. I can't just pick up a hobby for the sake of having a hobby. Right now I am learning how to code (really hard), learning japanese (insanely hard but surprisingly fun!) and I set myself some daily goals in regards to reading (30min non fiction, newspaper every day, 1 foreign affairs article). But this is highly subjective. Gaming was my identitiy, my purpose. I can't just replace this with some willy nilly Walk-in-park kind of hobby.    Anyhow, this post is already way too long so feel free to ask ; )  Edit: Oh I kind of forgot the most important thing... did I have success? Yes and no. I still haven't found what I'll devote my life to. But I play games for maybe an hour at a time and only some days a week. I still get cravings and I still have to force myself to stay away from MMORPGs etc. it's not like I am ""over it"", it's a constant struggle. But I am very successfully moderating my gaming and to be honest... I deleted almost all my games upon realizing that I didnt really enjoy any of them. Now you could say that e.g. learning a new language isn't always fun or sometimes it might feel like a drag for most of the time but you're learning a real life skill that can benefit you in endless ways. Means you dont have to enjoy every second of it. With games (I'd say) things are bit different. Most of your gaming will never yield any tangible results or rewards so if you're not enjoying it then it's probably time wasted."

Some science is just extremely hard to absorb for myself.  I knew I had addictive tendencies so I never let myself play MMORPGs (wisely no doubt). I did let myself play Fallout 3 and Fallout 3 New Vegas and that shit got really bad while I was playing them. I think I was doing about 60-80hrs a week for both of those for the 2 or 3 weeks that it took to play those to their conclusion.   SC2 was my vice primarily (especially the TowerD towards the end). My friend enabled me about 3 years back by buying me a laptop that could handle it (with the assistance of my family as a Xmas gift) and the game itself. I don't think my family knew about the latter addition to the present, nor knew how much time I'd spend on certain videogames in the past. I was avoiding getting a comp that could handle SC2 because things got really bad with WC3 and the initial SC...   After I eventually played SC2; it eventually got bad. I realized it didn't work too hot with Grad School. Then I tried to moderate it with parental controls for half a year. I realized I'd usually blow through my 10hrs of allotted weekly time in two or three days. After that realization and seeing that my procrastination was making doing school reading less and less likely... I decided to take the plunge.  Similar to you, I've put a mental yellow tape around a number of game types and all online gaming. I pretty much avoid gaming all together but I'm not averse to playing things that haven't been triggers for myself.  I'm with you on sleep, my sleep schedule was getting pretty good for a few months there... While my sleep habit is still awful relative to societal norms, it's getting there; and let me tell you my sleep schedule has chronically been an utter mess.  I've got a system that generally functions like Habit RPG. I actually worked in behavioral therapy for a long while for kids on the autism spectrum and we used general reinforcement schedules pretty regularly to promote preferred behaviors. I utilize a highly modified and indepth system to promote improvement. I've heard of HabitRPG I'm generally averse to things gaming themed so I'm a bit on the fence about it. On gaming theme aversion sometimes I even think to myself, ""geez, I dunno if I should come to stopgaming as much"" since it brings games generally to the forefront of my mind. That's only theory that it might be better after a point to stop talking about gaming addiction so much.   Before I get over 3000 characters I'll stop here. Thanks for the advice and scientific explanation. I appreciate the neuroscience conclusions/theory on top of the psychological theory and philosophy."

It sounds like you have a good plan. One I might suggest to think about is what will you do when you're at home and tired from doing all of your activities during the day? If you've already played guitar or you're not in the mood, what can another go-to be?  Also, if you're feeling stressed, what's a way you can get that temporary escape?   You have a great plan so good job. I just wanted to bring those two scenarios up because they are the common ways we will end up being most tempted to play. And they can sneak up on us even when we have new activities.  We've got your back, let us know if you need any help!"

I am currently in the process of following up some graduate job applications so these will be my primary responsibility when I am in and around the house.   I have however only got 2 schemes I am looking at right now and if I am honest one doesn't sound that appealing.  I finish my final exams in 2 weeks so after that I will start researching more graduate opportunities.   As far as the other times when I am tired from the day and would normally game I guess I will probably watch a TV series or movie on Amazon Prime. My attention span for reading is completely shot however in a few months I hope it will be better and I will feel enticed to get into some good books again.

I never really thought i would play too much untill i realized i've spent over 1k hours into Counterstrike, over 2k into Battlefield (the good one #2) and that i've actually been playing games since i was 6yr old.   I feel sorry for you, seeking for friendship in a addictive MMO surely isn't the right way to go. And i imagine that MMO even more feel like a waste of time because you are just grinding and grinding. therefor i never played them and don't understand how some friends of mine spent their 1k hours of ingame time in a MMO.  To feel the void i can recommend to get active. Hit the gym (you might learn to socialise a bit there, that's what i'm hopeing for and you're also becoming fit and if you don't socialise at least you've become fit), you also can buy yourself a mountain bike and start cycling across the land, that's what pumps the most dopamine into my brain because i'm starting to feel like a free man on my bike).  Or how about learning to play a instrument or programming or video editing? What ever you do good luck stranger"
StopGaming,36ndui,UzairDjillaliYahud,2,Wed May 20 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what I think it is bro. I think it's that those of us who spend most or all of our free time gaming still feel like children on the inside. Not in the good, creative way but in the I dont have to transform into the adult version of me just yet kind of way, which is irresponsible and immature. It's easy to try to rationalize how this isn't true, but take me for example.. I moved out of my parents at 23 and been living at the same place for almost 3 years now. It's great because I live close to my job and I'm surviving on my own, but I'm so fucking complacent. Sure, I consistently work out as well and am increasingly satisfied with my physique and strength, but I spend all my other free time getting really stoned and playing video games/surfing the internet sometimes until the wee hours of the morning, literally like a fucking zombie. As you guessed, I very rarely/never socialize outside of work and family, and I try to avoid family gatherings like the plague.  You think it can get worse? Well it can because my addiction is 99% League of Legends and I REALLY SUCK at that game 75% of the time.. I'm a huge detriment to that community for only being 1 player.  The people who bring up the point of over-stimulation are right. Be it weed, gaming, PMO, TV, webrowsing, or good things like weight lifting, running, or playing a sport, even sex! All of these things provide a rush to your brain and being that are much more intense than the other activities we would be wise to complete during each day such as cooking, washing the dishes, cleaning, laundry, etc.   I think I went on a huge tangent there but back to my original point, being that It's easy to be a functional gaming addict, by that I mean stay physically healthy, provide for yourself, and spend all your free time getting stoned, drunk, and mindless gaming/webbrowsing (lets be honest, we cant stay focused for hours on end; we become webzombies unless we get up to eat food or something). But is this the life you really want? Another reason I stayed hooked to League was that it was easy to feel like I was around other people. I think that warm feeling you get from multiplayer, especially a game with such a chaotically silly community was my easiest route to not feeling so lonely. Fucking pathetic, I know..  So in whole, I think our only good option is to pick up better hobbies and persuits than gaming. Skills and hobbies that help solve real problems instead of imaginary ones, or which provide you with a satistaction and stimulate growth in key aspects of our lives."

I think this South Park clip (NSFW language) accurately describes addiction. There are many contributing factors, but it's fundamentally due to dopamine regulation screwing up because someone spends too much time doing something pleasurable. The dopamine regulation section of this wikipedia article explains it well."

This is one of the primary motivations behind emphasizing diversity in a corporate context: if a workforce has a cultural makeup representative of its customers, then it will theoretically be better able to empathize with and service those customers.  A male teacher is more likely to have experienced statistically male problems and understand how to resolve them. So if male students are not having their needs met, male teachers are more likely to be effective at resolving those needs."
StopGaming,36ls3z,its0K,3,Wed May 20 12:47:25 2015 UTC,"I do agree that e.g. a company has to be aware of the peculiarities of its customers or employees, which could include the food to serve in the company cafeteria.   I do not agree that, in the context of raising or educating children, we need male teachers to empathize with male problems. Female teachers (I believe) can do this just as well as male teachers. Instead of focusing on male and female troubles and assigning mentors of equal gender we should just address these issues regardless of gender. But feel free to prove me wrong with peer reviewed evidence (really, I will gladly change my opinion when presented with sound evidence).   I don't want to nitpick or talk about things out of context but take this for example:   “Boys don’t write diaries! The worst thing I can imagine giving a boy as a present is a diary.”   I could just as easily say: Girls don't chop wood! The worst thing I can imagine assigning a girl as a task is physical labor! I know, I know, this is hyperbole. But I hope that it highlights how ridiculous that claim is. Boys probably don't write diaries because masculine, manly men like Mr. Zimbardo here tell them not to. Because movies tell them not to. Because [placeholder for culture] tells them not to.   So yes, even though this guy is an acclaimed Stanford psychologist I think he's past his prime and we'd all be better off if he could just shup up."

I did a bit of looking around and from what little I've seen it looks like the research supports your point of view. For example, this study suggests that male teachers are generally worse at having relationships with students, and both male and female teachers had more conflicts with male students than female students. So changing the gender ratio of teachers likely won't alleviate the problem.  I also really like your chopping wood example. Just because something isn't traditionally masculine doesn't mean it's not beneficial for men."

In my case, I tried playing in moderation and realized I was not enjoying it. Just one hour of Diablo 3 or Destiny was pointless to me, so I stopped completely. I only loved games when they really took all my time and I could just play hours and hours and forget the world outside. Playing just one hour did not make sense to me.

I have never posted on this subreddit and i have stopped gaming for only a week. Still, i never had problems quitting games, i uninstalled LoL quite easily, even with my friends calling me to play. Games of the skinner-box nature have little to no effect on me, i can only play games that i admire the design such as Street Fighter and DotA. I was compelled to login and write this post because i share the expectation that people here would actually be in a more severe case.  My brother used me as a punching bag since i was very little and called me retard and such everyday. This made me develop some problems over time such as social anxiety, feelings of impotence, helplesnes, lack of hygiene(which was a call for help), and more. I have punched and broken a mirror because i saw my reflection and didn't like what i was seeing, and in another incident my mother and my brother were blaming me for something that wasn't my fault so much that i lost control, i started punching my table repeatedly until my mother got a hold of me, then i proceeded to start screaming as loud as i could, she and my brother tried to calm me down saying things as ""stop yelling"" and i yelled ""I  WILL  NOT  STOP  YELLING!!!!!"". The result of this was that my brother got scared of me, and my mouse, table and headset were broken. Still, this is already a chapter in my life that is gone, i have now peace of mind to live my life without my family putting me down.  The reason i started this challenge was not much ""i need to do this, i have a problem"", it was more ""it doesn't hurt to try, after all i had no problems before"". As days went by, i have tried once to lie to myself to reinstall Street Fighter which i endured, making me realize that perhaps there is a problem, but also, the bigger problem seems to be the computer. So by avoiding using the computer(moderating) things are going well so far, i started going to the gym for the first time, returned to guitar practicing, read when i have nothing to do, started learning French(which i'm not very fond of), started having breakfast everyday instead of starvation, lost a lot of my social anxiety. To be fair, i do not think this is due to removal of gaming alone, it was mostly due to my mind being now in peace, allowing me to live my life without major disturbances, the removal of gaming only triggered the change.  I wont try to give you advice, instead i will say what made me crawl out of the hole. A psychologist. For me, but mostly for my family, because by fixing their bad habits it resulted in my life getting better.

What can you go to to help you get back and focused on dealing with the situation? Meditation or a Gratitude Journal are two great ways!

StopGaming,36ea1i,oddsol,3,Mon May 18 18:35:25 2015 UTC,Friendships are usually formed around common activities. I had (sometimes still have) a difficult time with my smoker friends when I quit. I think you won't be as good friends with those guys as before. Be open to making new friends around the stuff you do.
StopGaming,36ea1i,plusninety,2,Mon May 18 20:15:13 2015 UTC,"If they don't understand, that's their problem, you should not feel obligated to orient your life around what your friends do. Just like you don't have a reason to be angry at them for continuing to play games after you stop, they don't have a reason to be angry at you for stopping gaming while they continue.  I think it would be a great idea to keep in touch and hang out and communicate in other contexts if they're willing. If they're not willing, then I would say they're either not really your friends or so addicted that they can't set aside time for someone they care about. Either way it would be a good choice to meet new people who don't play so much. Easier said then done, I know, maybe you can join a club or a sports team or something similar to foster more social interaction and relationships.  Staving off the boredom is very challenging at first, but it gets easier over time. Everything else seems boring at the start, but I promise that changes over the long term. Exercise helps a lot, if there's anything you like doing besides playing games do that in your free time. One thing that I hear can help a lot (advice of /u/camerondare ) is filling up your schedule with recreational stuff to do so you don't have time to play games and you don't have so many moments of boredom."

When you quit gaming you need to make sure you find new activities to replace it. Otherwise you'll just be bored at home and you'll want to game. If you need ideas this thread has many.  And then make sure you schedule your day so you always know where your time is going. Otherwise again, you'll be bored and that's when temptations are the highest.  I have two videos that will help you out a lot:  The first is: What If You Find Other Activities To Be Boring? and the second is How to Stay Friends With Your Gamer Friends.  Not all your friends will understand why you're not playing, and that's ok. Find the ones that are supportive and continue to talk to them in new ways (Skype/FB instead of Steam for example), and then for the ones that aren't supportive, create distance for a period of time between you and them. It's not that they are bad people, it's just more important that you stay true to yourself right now.  Hope that helps!"

So when your body is craving caffeine/sugar, you may think it's craving gaming, and vice versa.

My hobby/goals are centred on programming and game development; so time spent at my PC all day is great - as long as I'm focused.  I used to have a similar issue to the one you describe. I installed a browser plugin called 'RescueTime' to track how much time I was wasting. I found it really helpful because I'm a bit of a numbers guy.

StopGaming,36cmbs,its0K,1 point,Mon May 18 11:44:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure about this to be honest. For a while I was thinking that I should get off the PC except when necessary for schoolwork, because I was using it to procrastinate. But the internet is a wonderful resource for information, entertainment, and communication.  Reading high-quality magazine articles online is not fundamentally different from reading them in paper, but the difference is I have easier access to them online than I do offline. If I get a recipe from a cookbook it's no better than getting it from the internet. However, there are many more recipes online than in my cookbook. The internet is a tremendously helpful tool.  The problem is that the limitless freedom offered online makes it easy to abuse in harmful ways. ""The great porn experiment,"" a TEDx talk, illustrates this idea. If you limit your internet use such that you only visit specific websites for the purpose of getting something productive done or doing things you would otherwise do offline, such as reading high-quality, non-clickbait magazine articles or looking up particular recipes, I think internet use should not be much more of a problem than any other activity.  The problem for compulsive internet users, as elaborated a bit in the video I linked, is usually easy-to-consume, stimulating, and rapidly changing content. So sites like YouTube, Facebook, BuzzFeed, and Reddit are examples of things you should avoid. Porn is also something you should definitely abstain from.  Games, on the other hand, are a form of entertainment with little to no educational value. You can quit games entirely without negative repercussions in the rest of your life. So I think if you are addicted, quitting games is a good idea. Quitting computer use entirely is better than doing nothing if you are addicted to the internet, but I think it is reasonable to try to moderate your internet use rather than going completely offline.  There's an add on called LeechBlock for Firefox that allows you to block particular websites or webpages, I don't know what browser you use but there are likely similar programs for it as well. You can block problem websites and leave others accessible, and this will make moderating your use a bit easier. For example you can block reddit by typing in www.reddit.com on one line but allow this particular subreddit by typing +www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming on another line."

By being able to track your progress a lot easier than you can in real life it is easy to think that you're actually being productive.  I started to realize I had a problem when I was continuing to game despite not even enjoying the games I was playing. I wasn't happy with the situation I was in and was feeling more depressed by the day.

StopGaming,36a3wx,ViciousBadger,2,Sun May 17 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely true. I think it sets in only as you age. It's hard to look back and see a wasted day when you're very young. Today's no different than tomorrow, so what difference does it make if you spent it playing games?  Once you're a little older you'll look back and see a whole lot of nothing and a lot of calories burned learning nonsense. Whereas others have moved on to bigger and better things, you're sitting there with no real skills, no real experiences, and nothing to look forward to because you spent time doing nothing while others built their futures. Your only solace is in games and even knowing that you really won't enjoy them much, you still go back and play some more to fill that void. It's not as potent as it once was, so you just play more.  I was in that same situation the past few years. No fun playing games but still gaming. Nothing else to do and this has always worked before. Maybe I'll just try a different game. Maybe I just need to spend more time on it. And so on."

I didn't feel I was using that as an escape, but I was playing it to get to know the characters and be told a story. Those types of games really are few and far between though. Like like in Hollywood. You'll find a movie that really says something, but it'll be surrounded by hundreds of movies that say nothing at all.  Maybe one day I'll be at a stage where I can enjoy those high quality games and not need to worry about being sucked into the black hole of mediocre distractions, but I'm not there yet. Just now, gaming is just there to distract me from life. I've been distracted way too long."
StopGaming,36a3wx,Jojonounee,1 point,Sun May 17 19:50:21 2015 UTC,"I've run into that as well. It's been a few years now that I've know that videogames are a waste of time and that I could be doing something useful but couldn't quite give it up. Even knowing that, every now and then I'd find a gem that's worth the time. Although those are becoming more and more rare as time goes on. Whether that's cynicism, age, or a general decrease in videogame quality is hard to say.  I think that if we were able to only spend time on those games that we wouldn't have been sucked into this issue. Too late now though, that time has passed and moderation will not work."
StopGaming,36a3wx,LearningSerenity,3,Sun May 17 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"My reasons certainly correlate with the ones in this thread.  Personally i was oblivious for a long time, from when i started gaming. The obvious signs were there, looking back:    my parents banned the game i played because i spent most of the day playing it (literally whenever i could) i became even more a-social than i was i remember wishing that i wanted to be in the game instead of being in real life (playing a MMOrpg) at a certain point i had decided that i would be happy with gaming for the rest of my life, this was when i was about 16. I even imagined myself sitting behind my computer, totally satisfied. I remember that moment very well, it's a image burned in the memory storage of my brain.   But despite all of those signs it took alot of struggle and more than 10 attempts to stop gaming, which of only 2 were serious attempts. The other attempts were just to satisfy my parents and to feel good about myself in that period of time.  Here i am, 15 years of gaming later. 27 years old. I'd love to say i was smart enough that i knew gaming was a real problem for me at an early age, but that's not the case. It's hard to say when exactly i knew it was a problem because i probably used every excuse in the entire universe to justify my way of life. I am a master-excuse maker for myself.  The moment when i realized real-life is worth a real try is probably around my 25th year of age. I never considered real-life to be worth it to be honest, and that doesn't come from me being depressed, i guess that's because i never really gave it a real shot. Every achievement in my life that i really tried to achieve (not that half-assed bullshit) are all in the virtual world, the gaming world.  I hope i didn't deviate too much from your question, but i do think it's important to get the whole picture."
StopGaming,36a3wx,LearningSerenity,2,Sun May 17 19:59:29 2015 UTC,"Discussion's always good.  Your parents were on to something. Even if they didn't realize exactly how bad things were (or would become) they knew that this wasn't right. They wouldn't have objected to you spending as much time playing a sport or practicing a musical instrument because those things have inherent value. It's interesting to know that people who had absolutely no idea what you were doing knew instinctively how awful it was.  Don't feel too bad about how you saw videogames at such a young age. You're carefree then and things like games are pretty much all you have to think about. Looking back you realize that it was unhealthy. Hindsight is 20/20.  Making excuses to continue a behaviour that you're addicted to is completely normal. Even as I made dinner this evening I was thinking about how a few runs through the challenge maps of Arkham City wouldn't be so bad. Few minutes, right? Why not? This is literally hours after posting about how damaging and mind warping videogames can be.  Why would you have tried? When you're hooked on videogames, those are your achievements. They become real, even though they're hollow and meaningless. We half ass everything so we can get back to playing in a land where we feel real achievement, even if it's just for an instant."

I was 25 before I figured out that I'd been unhappy for essentially my entire life up until that point...before then, I'd honestly thought I was happy.  The reality is that I was utterly miserable and hated pretty much everything about myself.  I realized I had a problem when I spent a week in which every free bit of mental energy was spent thinking about suicide, and again (after I went back ~6 months later) when I lost the ability to deal with life and spent ~2 months with little to no ability to engage in complex thought.  Neither experience of ""bottom"" was pleasant.  Getting serious about quitting and being unable to do so successfully further hammered home the reality that I had an addiction, not simply a problem.  Thankfully, a 12-Step program worked for me, and I haven't gamed since December 21st of 2013.  Suffice it to say that life has also improved substantially... :)"

StopGaming,369zbs,Laetitian,3,Mon May 18 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"Hey there.  In case you are interested, you might just be the reason my counter is continuing today. =)  But here is an experience I just made that might be relevant for you, as well:  A few years ago, I had already quit gaming for a second time, and both those Cold Turkey efforts were successful for half a year [and duration is not even the main issue], but the time was not spent happily, and certainly not productively. By comparison to those times, my last few months were wonderful, mainly because I did not only change my gaming behaviour, but also adapted my sleeping pattern towards going to bed at a fixed time each week. But that was still only the effect of the crucial difference in my strategy that I want to suggest to you.  I had not been able to pull off such a change of sleeping-pattern and termination of gaming activity since I started going to bed late, around eight years ago. The reason I have managed it this time was that I involved a real-life friend, and asked her for the favour of accepting daily reports about whether I had succeeded with my intentions regarding bedtime, and explain why I failed whenever that would have happened. The brutal honesty with which I did that forced me to actually be the person I wanted to be in front of my friends, which is, as I think you can understand, a situation that easily convinces you to stay on track.  I tell you this because you seem to be going half-way, and from my own experience, even if that would never set you up for a boomerang-effect [Pro-Tip: it does. And the relapse when you are at an emotional low is hard.], it inevitably comes with a large risk of not getting you anywhere. Even if you are game-less, you just lack motivation to use that new time, and gain satisfaction form it - no matter how many objectives you set yourself. Having someone whose opinion you care for check your progress will turn the entire project into something full of opportunity to change other habits.  If all of this does not sound convincing coming from me who I just had to come here to set myself back on track, I can add the quite demonstrative fact that the entire reason why I have just had a rough fortnight, and was bordering relapse today, was actually that I did not adhere by my reports to my friend over the past three weeks. I will start sending her mails again tomorrow morning, and force myself to explain exactly how I spent my night today on YouTube, and thus am heading towards failure with a few group projects. You can imagine the dedication I have to get back into disciplined compliance with my rules, in order not to have to send her mails like this over the course of the entire week.  Hoping I might have helped you make your project even more thorough,  Laetitian"

Posting updates to a friend sounds like a really good idea. The reason I haven't told my friends that I'm quitting is because I'm scared they will roll their eyes at me and not take it seriously. I have told them I am going to quit in the past but I always end up relapsing. Because I keep going back they are hesitant to support me. I've had a friend show anger and disappointment in me when I've relapsed in the past so I don't want to involve him in case it happens again."

I guess my point is that if you really do want to be an engineer, you can bounce back."

If you are unable to moderate, continuing to abstain is probably the right approach. Although you might not feel like it now, there are many things in life that can fill the same emotional needs that games used to for you without the negative consequences.  It sounds like you are stressed out and need something to relax. This can be achieved without games. Another redditor suggested trying some light exercise (for example, going for a walk) or another low-key activity whenever you start feeling frustrated. It will help you get your mind off work and improve your mental state.  Make sure you don't fall into the trap of thinking that your only options are to work hard or play games. You aren't a machine, you have emotional needs, and paying attention to them and fulfilling them will make your life better."

That sounds really harsh... but it's exactly what I did.  But think about what you're proposing--playing games for some ""break time"". How much confidence do you have that your gaming will be confined to the break? Do you have any evidence in your history of game playing that you would stick to this limited amount of gaming?

I'm going to give an unsolicited opinion on taking meds, so feel free to call me an ignorant asshole and ignore this if you'd like.  I've been addicted to both substances and video games, and I can say that they both had very similar psychological effects on me. They would scratch any mental or emotional itch I had, and make me feel at ease regardless of what was going on in my life.  Whenever I encountered problems or difficulty in life, I could simply retreat to my addiction of choice and forget about it. I failed to engage in life as it was happening to me, and so over time I essentially failed to grow as a person. I was stuck with the emotional capabilities of a teenager.  I'm not a psychiatrist, and I'm not going to say that ADD or ADHD is not ""real"". I've often thought that I might suffer from a similar ailment. And there's nothing wrong with taking medication that has an immediate positive impact in your life. But it's worth considering that your difficulties in focusing and engaging in life may be the results of addiction affecting your life over an extended period of time. These are things that you can overcome and change, without medication, if you work at them."
StopGaming,362lvn,jotakami,1 point,Sun May 17 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"I actually share a lot of your opinions on meds. I finished strong in college after initially struggling with no help from medication (3.7 GPA). I tried foods rich in Omega 3s and did see an effect on my concentration level. I exercise regularly and eat right for the most part. ADD and ADHD are very real for some people. Just like depression, they are overdiagnosed.  But as far as the effect of the boost in concentration from foods and supplements that helped, it wasn't enough and faded after a month. Even taking out the video games and staying active in my programs, I was still struggling to really put it together at work.  Honestly, once I got on the meds, the effect was instant. It only takes a fraction of the energy to get started. The focus level that it provides keeps me time and energy efficient. I come home after work still fresh and ready for all the other hobbies that I enjoy. With all that being said, this is still very early on and I know there's a possibility that I could regress.  I also did reading on the effects my meds have on other people and it didn't work for them. Not only did it not work, but they got addicted to it and caused more short term issues. So you're right in saying that a lot of people could overcome their difficulties without the help from a pill. For me in this instance, I truly don't believe it's the case after a 10 year professional career of struggling to be as productive as I know I can be."

I'd speed to get through my shit and game and watch TV the rest of my time. or do my homework and watch TV at the same time.

What you want to remember is that you game for specific reasons - it fulfills certain needs you have - and you'll always find a way to fulfill these needs, whether that's in healthy or unhealthy ways... consciously or unconsciously.  So you are right that if you quit gaming and don't be intentional about how you're going to fill the void gaming has left, you'll unconsciously fulfill it using other outlets like coffee, the internet, porn, etc.  The key is to be intentional with how you are going to fill your time without gaming. When I quit I made sure I wasn't in the house very much so I wasn't tempted to go on the internet, watch porn or go on Netflix.  So consider all of that first.  Next, you can find ways to quit the other ""bad"" things. I've also quit porn and think it's a very good idea.

Really happy to hear you enjoyed my Game Quitters videos and TEDx talk. :)  To block gaming on your iPad/iPhone look at Parental Controls. You're an adult so Parental Controls sounds funny but just have your wife help you out with it. That should allow you to block anything you need to. Here's a guide for you.  Also remember to get your badge for /r/StopGaming here.  Let me know if I can help in any way! :)

Unfortunatelly there's no way to block only games, but I can block everything and ask my wife to keep the password a secret. I think that would help, since there're no barriers at all to download a game on the ipad.  I just got a badge, thanks for pointing that out.  Since you (the author) responded to my post, let me say that your video was a source of inspiration to try to find more help and to see that I'm not alone in this fight against dangerous gaming habits.

You'll have great times and you'll have times where nothing seems to work like you'd want it to.  Games on the other hand are designed to avoid this. Lost a game of league of legends? Well then play another one! Easy! No consequences, no regrets! Of course that's more comfortable!  But reading your thoughts about this make it clear that you have spent some time thinking about it. You know how it works. You know that every day you spend avoiding any uncomfortable situation by gaming, it'll only get worse! Making the need to escape even stronger! It's a hopeless downward spiral many of us gaming addicts live in.   There's one clear advantage you, I and all those who read this post have.   We know the problem. We know the process that's keeping us tied down. We know that the only way to get out of this downward spiral of despair is to stop gaming! Taking those problems head on!

StopGaming,35ytg7,its0K,2,Fri May 15 09:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's difficult to substitute hard work for an addictive behavior. I've been struggling with this recently. I stopped gaming but have been substituting with compulsive internet use. I tried to cut out unproductive computer use a few days ago, and I spent two days reading, working, doing assignments, and listening to music, but when on the third day I ran into an assignment that seemed impossible I felt I needed something more than reading or music to cope. So I relapsed and spent eight hours watching streams and YouTube.  It would have been better if I recognized ahead of time that I was mentally approaching the assignment in the wrong way. However, I think we will always end up struggling with frustrating situations in our lives, so we need to develop alternative coping strategies. One method is to recognize when you are becoming frustrated with a situation and to deal with it before it becomes too much of a problem. So if you feel a strong need to avoid working on the project, instead of thinking that gaming is your only way out, you can cut yourself some slack and take a break until you feel better.  Another problem is not having activities that offer the same level of stress relief and escape as gaming does. Like /u/camerondare advocates, you need to find other stuff that can substitute for what gaming provides in your life. So instead of deciding ""I feel helpless in the face of all this work I have to do, I'm going to take control of my situation by playing games"" find other stuff that fulfills that role. I think my emergency activity is going to be running, because it is an effective way to improve my emotional state and temporarily get away from my problems."

If it is possible you could very carefully discuss seeing a doctor or therapist. Treating one addiction isn't easy, let alone several at the same time, if you have a baby and the entire thing within the context of family. Sometimes it's easier to hear from or confess to a stranger, a neutral third person or a medical professional than to the people close to you.  If treatment isn't an option I'd start by prioritizing his addictions. Substance abuse is probably the most severe and dangerous from the list, as video games or porn won't directly affect your health.  After having come up with a priority list, you could start working on the number 1 issue. This does not mean indulging in the other vices to make up for the lost pleasure but at the same time it wouldn't be wise to tackle all of these issues at the same time without professional guidance.   Generally speaking, especially in more severe cases, there is just no way around abstinence. But (!) abstinence can trigger withdrawal symptoms which can be a medical emergency. So long story short, as a medical professional, I can't really bring myself to recommend anything concrete without having a deeper understanding of the situation and degree of addiction."
StopGaming,35ts1a,veydar_,4,Wed May 13 15:00:16 2015 UTC,"Gaming porn drugs and alcohol, that's gonna be a tough one!  Not finding enjoyment in the real world is a common issue for addicts and is often a sign of depression, and they use anything available to distract them from the fact their lives bring them no joy. All the things you mention perform a nice bait and switch on the mind - they promise that dopamine hit we desire, and provide it in spades, but immediately after leave it wanting more, all the while burning out your physical and mental health; numbing and disconnecting you from your real situation. I would suggest discussing what could be the cause of depression, it could be career/stress/fatherhood/lack of direction, there's usually a root cause that can't really be medicated against - an underlying malaise that drives someone to escape from reality. The fact he has acknowledged it as a problem is a great start, encourage him to open up more about it, if not to you then to a counsellor."

He can't pinpoint it to anything in particular. He has been addicted to gaming for as long as he can remember and I think the gaming has caused the depression.

I would suggest he comes here himself and reads through some of the threads, or start his own. It can take years to really hone in on the problem, or never if he doesn't start talking about it. Fatherhood can be a massive shock in terms of the huge responsibility that comes from it, and obviously motherhood too. Both of you are in that together, so that's something you can work on together and try to pay attention to what you both still want from life and make plans to work towards that. In terms of addictions, that's something he probably needs to think about removing from his life so he can use his time more effectively for both himself and the family, and that's something he might decide to do after talking to people that have the same issues."

They give your brain a sense of accomplishment quickly and repeatedly, and most importantly, without risk.   I think that for many people, particularly those like me that are underachieving in ""life"", games are something that will make any other activity feel underwhelming.

If you removed even just THAT then you would see a massive improvement.  However, I'd challenge you to go for a month without gaming, or 90 days is even better if you can handle it.  The longer you stay away from games, or at the very least cut down, the more accustomed you will be to not needing constant stimulation just all the time, and you will be able to focus more easily.   That said, its not simply quit games=instant ability to focus. One thing I've realised is that study/hard work and discipline is like a muscle you need to work. If you've never done that before, that just means it'll take time to build that up, so don't give up hope when you can't immediately do hours on end of hard work.  So yeah, give it a go!

And yea the example I said about the weekend was that I had played a marathon of games that require a lot of thought and precision and so it's mentally exhausting. Not doing that would free up capacity.  I think the point really is that I am someone who appreciates analysis and deep discussion and gaming culture and the industry discourages this, which is a deterrent for me for my life."

StopGaming,35p2gf,TheLensOfEvolution,3,Wed May 13 08:33:53 2015 UTC,"Your desire for high stimulation or a competitive environment isn't off. You're just channeling it in games right now, so the key to moving on from games is to find that need in other activities.  Will mini golf or watching a movie do it? Of course not, just like sitting in a cave alone won't fulfill your social need. That doesn't mean gaming is the only outlet for your competitive/high stimulation need, it just means you need to find an activity (or activities) that do fulfill it.  Personally I relate because I felt very similar, and managed to find that high stimulation/competitive desire in DJing and starting my own business. Skydiving has also been great and travel too. In fact I was just riding around on a scooter in Bali and let me tell you, the chaotic traffic causes you to go full tilt, it was pretty intense!  If you put more effort into finding a new activity other than finding away to justify gaming by suggesting silly things like mini golf or watching a movie you'll find much more fulfillment.  On another note, there is a physiological reason why you experience boredom in other activities, especially within the first 90 days after you quit gaming. I shared that research here."

StopGaming,35ps0c,camerondare,1 point,Wed May 13 09:01:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't really counter the urge. At least not initially. For a long while I avoided progressing in the program of recovery I had found/had been offered to me because I was afraid of coming to terms with myself and my percieved inadequacies. (I place a lot of my self worth on my external success and the opinions of other people)    I'm not really sure how long it took me to quit. To be fair I spent several months - maybe six or so? - just avoiding further progression. But the program itself is a daily and life-changing system.   2) I love playing Warhammer 40k with friends. Writing about it, discussing it. That stuff is my jam. Otherwise, sometimes working out, reading, debating military history and politics. Walks are cool to.  3) Yeah I lost a bunch of percieved friendships. But realized afterwards that these people were not my friends. I said ""Guys I really need to stop doing this, it's bad for me and I am going to quit"" That is not grounds for an argument. I am making a decision for me. The people who argued about it were only worried about how this might reflect on them and the fact that they might have a problem.  I have since gained a ton of friends that actually care about me and who I can talk to without fear of judgement or betrayal.   4) A lazy day isn't so hot for me. I'm pretty damn lazy though I do not like to admit it. Sitting in front of the computer most of the day. I am working to change that. A good lazy day would have lots of reading and walking.   5) Busy day is probably filled with a work on classes, painting minis, working out first thing in the morning, calling a sponsee.

For me Watching was more of an issue then actually playing.  If you have stopped playing league, but now watch SC2 and CS:GO in addition to the  LOL videos/streams then you are just diverting the issue on to something else (From playing to watching more). The issues you got from gaming, won't be resolved or anything because essentially nothing has really changed. I feel you need to get away from screens in general specifically the computer for entertainment or time filling purposes. At least I did.

There's nowhere to run from your feelings or yourself while sitting. This is really hard, for anyone, at first. But meditation can also help you overcome those feelings. It can teach you a profound acceptance of yourself and your life. It can teach you to love yourself. It can lead you down the road to real happiness.  Check out this phenomenal talk by the molecular biologist and French liaison to the Dalai Llama, Matthieu Ricard: The habits of happiness http://www.ted.com/talks/matthieu_ricard_on_the_habits_of_happiness  Of course, it's totally fine to not meditate too.

Another tip is always be nice to people and have a sense of humor. The advice I got was ""Throw a party"" you get a lot of people you don´t know in your house and can talk to them and boom you got new friends. But sitting on your ass doing noting is not gonna change the situation. Its also important not to give up when someone declines just smile and say ""perhaps another time"" and keep inviting them, this does not apply to girl you like, since it will label you a weirdo and stalker but just to friends. Try to take up space when you are around other people. Be a person that help others with their problems. Be proud of who you are and hold your head high. But most importantly be yourself.

You can strike revenge on people who gank you. There are repeating chores and tasks like keeping your creep score up, laning, jungling, and yet the overall objective is always there. There are also so many options with the heroes and items it seems near limitless. Endless diversity within 1 single map and gameplay. It's the perfect recipe for destroying ones life really. haha!

They will pass.  EDIT you've uninstalled it but you haven't let go emotionally. You have to keep reaffirming your decision to really give it up.

Quitting and then playing again within a day or two and repeating this 200 times will do that.  After that point, I was in a tough spot, gaming completely out of control.  Luckily I found a CGAA group online and with help was able to abstain from gaming completely.  I hit three years off games last month.  Check it out sometime."

Since restarting my counter a week ago i am going through a lot of times where i keep trying to find excuses that make it ok for me to play video games. I think finding ways to commit yourself are really the key and making sure that you really acknowledge whether you have a problem or not. If you are here and already feel like it impedes your life somehow then probably you see that it isn't helpful for you to keep gaming. I mean i used to game to relax, but i realized that i no longer actually relax when i game, i get invested, mad, frustrated, and just all around way more connected to a game then the things that i find to be more valuable. For me, i can feel it in the back of my head that gaming will just make me feel a little better but i know the road I'll go down, maybe today it'll be an hour, but almost assuredly by the end of the month i'll be right back at 8 hours a day so i just don't want to be there. Every time i start thinking about re-installing or that i might be fine after all, i just remember where i was when i decided to quit the first time."
StopGaming,35ewq2,Thunderbudz,1 point,Sat May 9 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"I suppose I also experience this. I feel like my different traits are each competing for their chance of controlling what I do.   My lazy trait used to really govern what I was doing. It would try to convince me that I really needed entertainment and gaming was the best option to be entertained. Whilst I was still gaming and deciding how to spend the evening a little voice inside my head would try to convince me to do something productive. Only upon quitting gaming has my ambitious trait started to take a bit of control back and suppress my laziness. Now I'm starting to do more things which actually improve my life. My laziness does still try to take control with arguments like ""It'll only take a few minutes to download and install this game, you'll have a great evening if you do"".  Another area where I feel like I have multiple personalities is in being social. My shyness often stops me from talking to women, even women that I've had good conversations in the past with. When I'm sitting by a girl at work for example and have a possible topic to talk about in my mind, my shyness will try to stop me with arguments like:  ""I don't think she'll be interested in the topic""  ""It's really loud in here anyway, so you'll have problems being heard""  ""You should get on with your work instead""  ""She doesn't seem to be in a good mood""  My more social side does come up with counter arguments, but currently I'd say my shyness has more control over me in this area. Obviously I'd like my social side to gain control, but I've been shy for the majority of my life so I'm struggling to break down the boundaries that I've put up. That isn't to say I'm not improving in this area, I'm a lot more talkative than I was a couple of years ago and since I've given up gaming completely I've noticed my social anxiety decreasing.  My advice for you is finding alternative ways of spending your time. Even if you aren't really having fun at first, I'd still say it's a lot better if you get out there and do something different, meet some new people etc. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in this never ending cycle? Anyway, it's down to you and I hope you make the right choice for yourself."

StopGaming,35btyj,atticus77,6,Fri May 8 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"I have an unusual but effective piece of advice; and that is to plunge headfirst into that 'feeling' of having absolutely nothing to do. Boredom if you will. Just sit there and feel it in its fullness. There is something underneath that and you have to sit down in a quiet space and simply feel your body and your emotions.  You see, as the Legend goes- a human being in his Natural state should feel 100% content and fulfilled in each and every moment no matter how mundane or normal it is. Simply by virtue of his own  ""being"" or sense of being alive if you will. I know it sounds all esoteric and I don't want to scare you but there is truth to these ancient teachings about man's true nature.  When you find yourself not content or ill at ease with the moment then diving headfirst into that feeling is- in a way- bringing you face to face with whatever resistance there is to your own natural state of contentment. This sounds even more bizarre- but the resistance is in your body. Your feelings/emotions get cut off and numbed down by video games and media. When you give it up, you find your emotions starting to flow again and this is very uncomfortable. The solution is to dive into the feeling as the emotions then do something to your body. If you think of it, crying is a cleansing reaction of the body. If you have something in your eye you will tear and clean it out. Likewise, emotions can cleanse or remove things from our body (and etheric body to be precise) that are hindering or cutting off our connection to this 'Natural State"" of contentment. You dont have to cry like a little girl, thats not what Im saying. There is a manly way to be with your feelings.  Think about this: Walt Whitman left his crazy, noisy society behind and lived in the woods alone and all of a sudden started writing profound shit about the nature of the universe and eternity etc. And that was back before they had ANY media! In this world we are living in today, think about how cut off from nature and our own inner nature we have become and how radically different your natural state would be to what society considers ""normal"". Hence, in a way the restlessness you feel is merely the umbilical cord of society trying to reel you back in to its domain. Cut it."

As for now i watched the documentary ""Your Brain on Porn""(which actually applies to most addiction and how the brain adapts and reacts to them). I also did some programming which i've started with the last couple of days and its challenging, creative, fun and rewarding.

If gaming is what you're struggling with right now, remember that gaming is simply a way to pass the time. Do you even have time to waste? Should you be doing something more important? The answer is probably yes. If it's no, find something! A creative outlet is really important. Learn an instrument, start writing stories, learn to draw, etc.  The longer you go without gaming the more you realise it just is an unhealthy way to fill up time. When you find real hobbies or more productive things then gaming don't even appeal to you as much.  Personally - this is my opinion - this is the stage you need to get to for moderation in any sense to work: you need to not rely on it at all. Only then will the odd hour of gaming be able to be a reality."

I'm more learning to control my habits, using it in a similar manner to reading a book or seeing a movie. Using as a social tool and entertainment source, not a way to escape from reality.   Gaming addicts cannot use gaming as a social tool any more than alcoholics can use the bar as a social hangout. It's a recipe for disaster.  Your life is not going to change if you replace Skyrim, LoL, Borderlands 2 (or whatever you play now) with indie games. If you're still intent to get your socializing through games, you won't reach out and meet people whose lives don't revolve around pressing buttons and jerking their mouse around.  I'm sorry if this comment sounds overly negative, but you're making rationalizations to keep playing before you've even quit.  If you answer no other questions in this comment, answer the following:  If you've barely played those Indie games since you bought them, why do you need to keep them as a crutch now?

I'm also an addict and though I'm not trying to quit, I'm trying to lower the gameplay hours - similar to your case.  I don't want to get into an arguement, especially not into this one because I think both parties are right. While CynicLibrarian is right in stating that this kind of approach can result in replacing one game with another with the same number of hours spent on gaming, I can understand eLyUKayEe's point of view; quitting something instantly is scary and not wanted.  I think you are doing something great to yourself by starting to control your addiction/habit, but please don't forget two mistakes I have committed in the past months:   Not minding the time. I replaced big volumed games with smaller ones and I ended up playing with the smaller ones for the same number of hours as with the big ones. Not replacing gaming time with something else. Addictions don't just vanish, they are replaced with something else: for example working out, something artistic or any kind of hobbies. I don't recommend doing chores or something dull in the beginning because you will associate ""quitting my addiction"" with something ""dull or not wanted"".   Good luck!

My mind is still loaded with media and programming that I have been binging on the last year and I need to get it out first before I feel better. My dreams last night, for example, were all revolving around computer games such as Age of Mythology. It was very restless, hypnotic, and I constantly felt like I had things to do and problems the solve (in the game). Not deep sleep at all.  Still, Im doing this. It's about time."

I dunno about cutting music too; maybe moderating intake of audio media shit. Or simply going to performances and making your own (like you seem to be implying). Hey though if it makes life better for you, then it is clearly good.  What madness brought you to gaming?  You're the guy who is doing the pushup challenge if my memory serves me. Guess the community will have to manage that."
StopGaming,357x6g,Jason_al-Askar,2,Fri May 8 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds pretty bizarre- a lot of what I write is. But I first noticed the effects of television when I found my head literally turning in the direction of the screen whenever I was in the vicinity of one. It was almost like a tractor beam. I thought ""damn this is some hypnotic shit"". Whenever I would give in for just a few seconds and ""tune in"" to what was on the T.V. I would instantly go into a hypnotic trance. Maybe it's the frame rate of the screen; maybe it's some bizarre black magic being done by a satanic global cabal that controls all the media networks; the effects of it have always been very objective.  Games are dangerous because there ARE small indie developers who create games free of any of this hypnotic/black magic stuff that has relatively little programming. But It's dangerous because it's like a gateway drug; one day you are playing a harmless indie game and the next you are back with big media like microsoft, E.A. sports, etc. Really dangerous stuff.  As for music... I really love music. I love the feeling it invokes. But the direct tie to a persons emotions is what makes music so powerful on a subliminal level. Unfortunately this has been used destructively. When you research a bit deeper into all the subliminal messages embedded in mainstream music and music videos you really start to see that it is being used as a weapon against the human mind.  The thing that spoils it for me is that I literally perceive these layers of media programming. For example, everyone is familiar with the term ""I have a song stuck in my head"" or ""I can't get this song out of my head"". No one really stopped to question why such a phenomenon occurs. Is the brain really that stupid to endlessly torment it's host with simple memory of a song? For me, I literally perceive a program that comes over my brain/mind and it is this program that replays the song over and over. Once I remove it, it stops repeating. Of course there are so many thousand layers of these programs that everything kind of merges into a cacophony much like in a school cafeteria or stadium. Its like living in a noisy city. You don't realize how much noise you've been living in until you suddenly move to the country and it's quiet.   The madness that brought me to gaming was partly wanting to escape my difficulties in this life. But also a deep craving for adventure, story, etc. But also it was a mistake because I dabbled around with some indie game but it acted like a gateway to bigger and bigger games. Before I knew it I was playing LoL, SC2, etc. The really bad ones.  And Yup I issued the pushup challenge as I have been wanting to get in shape for many years now :) good luck!"

You might wanna classify the games you play based on how fun/addicting they are and start with a game that's lower on the totem pole. See if you can build up some sorta self control and then if you're successful with moderating for that game/gametype (aka adhering to your premeditated timeframe) you might be able to try a game that you define as harder to control. If you can't stick to your goal; I'd say be very careful, and it'd most likely be best to stop playing that game and foster your self discipline and self control for an extended period of time before revisiting that game.  I know I've moderated pretty well at times and I have plenty of friends who seem to have utterly mastered self control.  Personally, I'm willing to be game free and I think my life will be better w/o. At least for the next year or two. Whatever floats your boat though. I didn't try this method; I probably would have compromised my goal and I don't know how successful I'd have been in staying away from the major addictive gaming source for myself: Tower D on SC2.

I don't know what college and work are like for you but if you really feel like you should be more productive (whatever that means) in the evening here are some random things that come to my mind.  Willpower is a bit like a muscle, the more you use it the stronger it gets but don't overuse it! This means that e.g. meditation isn't some esoteric bullcrap but a great exercise to strenghten ""that muscle"" (= willpower). Sit down, relax and try to have as blank a mind as possible for 5 minutes.   Maintain a To-Do list! Don't write things like ""Clean apartment"" but rather use concrete and achievable goals such as ""Tidy up living room"", ""Vacuum kitchen"". Some tasks might seem vague or intimidating so splitting them up into smaller chunks helps me to tackle them.  Do you get enough sleep? Do you use the snooze button excessively or drink alcohol in the evening? Sleep deprivation negatively affects your willpower.  Do you exercise (both strength and endurance) and get some fresh air? If you don't I guess I don't have to spell out what that means in regards to willpower.  Note your willpower lapses throughout the day. If you have a bit of a sweet tooth try to regulate that. Or try to eat healthier etc. All of these little ""challenges"" can strengthen your willpower, but again, don't overdo it.  Last but not least ... what is it that you would like to do in the evening that feels productive?

It is like a hypnotic spell that comes over you in order to keep people sedated and asleep.

StopGaming,350cep,dfu101,1 point,Wed May 6 22:42:31 2015 UTC,I think I had made laziness an M.O. of mine for the past 10 years so my story isn't as rosy as yours. Im trying to keep in mind just how pervasive I let my laziness get. It ebbed and flowed but I definitely didn't challenge myself all too frequently. When I worked it was usually about 25-30 hours 33-38 if you include driving. Many times I did hang out with friends for a good chunk of the week but surfing the internet watching videos and VGs ate the rest of the time.  I think part of me always wants to take it nice and easy when it comes to progressing my career along. Its tough to have the drive for me still and give up all the leisure...   Good to hear your story. I definitely have my up and down days. This has been a rough year. Grad school can be frightening experience; especially when grappling with other mental baggage like addiction.
StopGaming,350cep,dfu101,2,Wed May 6 03:54:08 2015 UTC,"Well there is laziness and then there is just enough being on your plate. We all have our different journeys and capacities for activities. Either way all these mindless ways of wasting your time are not doing us any favours. I understand the need to unwind to something, but it is paramount you are in complete control of your habits. I rewatch some old series when I eat(X Files) and that is enough bubble gum for my brain. Everything else I do in the day counts towards making my tomorrow self a little wiser and a little stronger.   One of the most difficult things is to get the momentum going. But when you recognize the harm certain negative habits do to you, that should be all the motivation you need to get your butt up and start doing something differently. Slowly but steadily I substituted most of my negative habits into positive ones. People really do get used to anything. The trick lies in consciously taking control of the behaviour of your habits and not passively respond to the external stimuli, like the masses blindly following trends, watching whatever they are told to watch and buying whatever they are told to buy. Proactivity is key. If you don't choose yourself, someone else will choose for you."

Our brains are not wired to cope with the easy, cushy, sheltered lives full of instant gratification and quick fixes, which is where addiction kicks in. What we really, truly crave below the surface is a cycle of comfort and discomfort. Fundamentally, we want to work our asses off and achieve something, relax and enjoy it, then continue or try something else. Gaming diverts the short term pleasure centre and makes us forget about long term goals and meaning so we end up avoiding discomfort to skip straight to the ""rewards"", which explains the widespread depression among heavy gamers."

When there were problems, the Internet helped, so I learned to rely on the Internet to solve a significant part of my problems -- and now the Internet itself is the problem, and I have no one who can help. It feels like a bait and switch scam.  I agree with you that if you have friends, a job, stability, no huge problems in your life like your parents dying when you were young, then it's possible to keep it only as a time-wasting hobby. It went from a hobby to something I can't escape, or find treatment for, because computers and living a great deal of life on the Internet are so ubiquitous that I can't find a psychologist who believes that this is an addiction, despite me suffering greatly and wanting to get away from it.

It has everything to do with the fact that for whatever reason, someone wants to quit playing video games.  It has everything to do with the fact that there exists a life outside of gaming, and we are all welcome to live our lives the way we want. If gaming is a part of that, great, game away, but if it's not, that's great too.  The issue that has appeared is that many who want to quit run into varying degrees of difficulty in doing so. There are many reasons why this happens, and they include both physical and environmental components.  The physical side involves structural changes to your brain from overexposure to the dopamine overload you experience in gaming.  The environment side has to do with gaming being an integral part of your identity, social community and fulfilling other human needs we have.

I was not aware that you guys really are addictive to a sense that you can't differenciate between reallife and gaming as a hobby.   We can distinguish gaming from real life, or a mere hobby from addiction - in fact, being able to do this is necessary in order to realize the own addiction.  (But if you meant something along the lines of ""the gaming took over your life"", then you are certainly right.)   Yet i can't let the point stand, about gaming being a waste of time over other activities   Name one positive thing that gaming does to you and I'll give you five other pasttime activities, that do it better.  Don't get my wrong, if you are not playing for an unhealthy amount of time, it is alright, I am not saying that computer games are evil - but there are certainly more fulfilling activities. Even back then when I still played for reasonable amounts of time, gaming left me with a feeling of emptiness, while even somthing as simple as a walk in the park/nearest forest brings me joy, even though it is ""wasting time"" too (in the sense of ""not being productive"")."

Why would they wanna do it? Because gaming has taken over their lives.  Yes, I know, everything in moderation. but we can't moderate. I cannot sit down and play one single game of league, when I play one, I gotta play ten. I can't do just one wow quest. Some people can't watch just one episode of a series on Netflix. A lot of people have problems with moderation, ours is gaming.  Think of it this way: Some one who goes to an AA meeting, can't be recommended to moderate on alcohol, because they don't know alcohol moderation, that's their reality. Maybe they can casually smoke, maybe they can casually do whatever, but they can't casually drink.  We have realised that gaming took over our lives, we also know we can't moderate, and we also want something else from our lives. Yes, we bash gaming more than we bash anything else, just like people on rehab bash whatever they want gone from their lives.  We are not telling you that you should quit, we are telling ourselves, and you overheard it. I don't trash talk on gamers, and have no problems with people who are gamers.We are not trying to say your form of entertainment is invalid, it's just not for us.

StopGaming,34z4yh,atraeju,2,Wed May 6 04:33:12 2015 UTC,"It's not only for those who are fully addicted though, gaming as an activity is a kind of false high, it gives you an infinite ladder of tasks to complete/achievements to do and in this process rewires the part of your brain that associates with work & reward. As you gradually play more and more, you will subconsciously start to avoid real-world tasks that might ask for more of your effort/attention than a game would - the game achievement gives you the same internal chemical reactions as a real world achievement would, for far less effort. Now obviously some games do this 'better' than others, and some people can deal with that with no problem whatsoever as they have a good grounding in self-discipline and perhaps self-confidence. But take a person who has grown up with gaming, where the hobby has played a part in their nurture, their biological makeup, and you may find they have a real problem. Look up internet & gaming addiction in Asia for example, and it's actually an epidemic there.  I personally grew up with games, and I have a huge passion and love for some of the experiences I've had over the years, they honestly changed the course of my life in very positive ways at times, helping me make connections that opened up opportunities that led me to where I am today. But, having come to feel almost like they are almost an obligation now, that my hobby has turned to habit, I ended up here and it started to make more sense to me. I've been playing for around 25 years, and games pretty much brought me up from toddler to adult. You can't underestimate the effect that has on your thoughts, habits, daily routine etc. Giving up games allows you to break away from that, and achieve some equilibrium in life, and perhaps find a new path to focus on. That's my goal at any rate, but I would never tell anyone to give up games, only show them what they might be doing to them."
StopGaming,34z4yh,Borcarbid,2,Wed May 6 00:33:59 2015 UTC,"Gaming for me was just as much a life style as a pass time and I would seriously argue against your assumption that gaming as a hobby/career is the same as learning how to write well be a good musician or learn another skill. First off and primarily the difference lies in the life style. I know some people will disagree with me on this but I don't like spending my time in front of a screen. I like now taking time to cook healthy meals and go on walks and I now love my life.Secondly gaming is nothing like music writing art etc. because gaming involves almost no creative composition. Hear me out, video games are a lot like books you can get better at reading them or understanding them but all that you get out of them is a feeling of consumption and not creation. I don't really know how to explain this it is kind of abstract but I think playing games is just like a song, book, movie, tv show, although games are interactive you are never able to learn from it how to create a piece of media (book, game, song, movie, etc.). Because the only way you learn those skills is through practicing them. So for me the reason i stop was A i was addicted and no addiction is healthy B I actually half the time felt bored even when I was playing games and C I wanted to become a creator not a consumer.  Hopefully some of you understand what i was trying to say I wish I were more clear but hopefully that's understandable"

If you are reading an intellectual piece of work, you are stimulated and challenged intellectually - and that can be quite exhausting. Even fiction books are not mere consumption, like watching a movie, or playing a game - you are imagining the world that the story takes place in and thus you are stimulated creatively."

It's the same feeling you get when you study 8 hours the day before exam and pass the exam with an A. That is the great feeling about me playing games and not the feeling of ""Oh I unlocked a new level"". Maybe thats what differes me from the rest on this subreddit, because I do only game to improve and compete rather for pure fun. Thats probably why I couldn't understand you in the first place, but after reading some comments here i generally get the idea of this subreddit and how you guys feel towards gaming.

Saying learning a music instrument doesnt give you any benefit in life, is just crap. I am playing in a band and made most my friends through music. I was addicted to games and most of my ""friends"" i got there. But in the end in the more than 8 years of hardcore gaming i only really made 2 friends -  a number not even comparing to those i would consider friends i made through music in less than a month.   Quote from Wiki: A hobby is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time.  Most of the people here ( including me) are addicted to video games. And no matter what you say, playing 8 hours of video games, even on the week end is an addiction when you do it regularly. A lot didnt even enjoy gaming anymore, but just couldnt restrain the urge to play. Also a lot used games as an escape tool to stop feeling and just get ""rid"" of the problem -  some would say a legal heroine shot.   In your answer to @xFaght u make a flawed comparison. Every person want to do something that they enjoy rather than something that might be a lot of work, however if you are addicted you just cant control it.  ""Is addiction even bad? -  as long as you can controll it"" -  if you can control it it is not an addiction.  Piano - Gaming cannot be compared, stop making flawed comparisons.

Does that mean the person is addicted? And is addicition even bad? As long as you can control it and moderate it to a certain extend that it does not control your life, it is alright. I consider myself addicted by the fact that i would not be able to drop gaming right now and never play again. But why should I? I can moderate it fairly well, I do sports and go out with friends. As long as you have self discipline, there should be no problem. Set priorities and not get it over you. People like that should rather go to /r/addiction and try to learn how to control their behaviour. Your argumentation makes sense though, but i see more people who acutally stop gaming because they feel its wasted time, instead of having a severe addiction that influences their life. I have no problem with people who try to get of gaming cause they feel bad about gaming, but they cant stop. That is the point where people should consider it a dangerous addiction. But when i read things like ""Stop gaming because its a waste of time"" or ""You want to tell your grandchildren that you were the best tetris player in your school? Better learn an instrument or do something else other than gaming"" as if those things would be considered more productive than gaming. I agree that doing productive things is set above all, such as working out or working, but everybody should realise that the day consist of work AND free time where you enjoy yourself and have fun that is not productive at all.

Addiciton isnt defined by really enjoying something or prefering it over everything else. It is chemistry. It isnt even necessarily defined by time spent.   People here wake up playing video games  They rush through their lives to get back to video games. They postpone sleep to play. When they cant play they experience withdrawal, literal withdrawal symptoms. For most video games are a fine hobby. But to declare you know better is a little arrogant.. but that is just me.

I really do think that watching streams/youtube videos is almost identical to playing the game itself (based on personal experience). It's also going to lead you to wanting to play the game --> playing the game itself.  If it's not so much a problem then just try to set some time where you put away everything except your uni work.

I agree that the notion that not playing video games will solve your problems in life is ridiculous. But it can be beneficial for people to abstain from something that they don't actually enjoy doing but feel a compulsion to do and instead develop a lifestyle they enjoy more."

In that time you could have mastered an instrument. Or something else. Don't you feel like you could accomplish something more tangible? If your grandfather/father told you he was a master player at X stupid childhood game would you feel impressed? Video games are an escape from reality and life. A very fun escape, but an obstacle to overcome.  As a challenge, try to quit games and other media (binge watching movies/tv series) and try to substitute it with excersize and a different hobby. If you find yourself thinking you're bored, read a book. Challenge yourself to survive 90 days without games. If you can't do that you admit you are addicted. You need to find a way to stop. Is alcohol good for an alcholic? Is heroin good for a heroin addict? Is gaming good for a game addict? Gaming is just like any other addiction, we keep gaming to get another high or hit from playing games, hoping to get a better response the next time we play. It's surviving, not living. Try 90 days, set up some goals to try to accomplish.  Instead of staring into space blankly read books. /u/camerondare keeps posting a hobby idea list, try to start there. Pick one and do it.

On top of it, he is probably still playing it, so he can teach you at least the basics or even play with you, if you already have learned how to play an instrument.

Practice is practice; When a violin player plays 8 hours a day on his violin, he can't interact with people in the same time. The progamer can neither. But after those 8 hours, can he interact with people after his practice is over? Sure. Some progamers play 12-14 hours, which is infact very insocially, but not all do.

The key is to find activities that fulfill the same needs gaming fulfilled for you. So exercise and hiking is good, and finding ones that are social and out of the house is great too. Try meetups.com for social activities.  Also have an activity in mind for when you are home. When I first quit I managed to stay out of the house basically all the time, but eventually you will get back home and you just want to have some ideas for what you will do with that time. When you're tired from all the hiking and socializing and you're at home... what will you do? To relax, TED talks and watching documentaries can be good. Cooking, reading in general or about nutrition and/or psychology I've also found to be helpful.  If you can try and move your contact with your cousin/friends to somewhere outside of Steam to lower your temptations.

I won't be able to move them out of steam until I drop the bomb... pfffftttt... not looking forward to that. Hopefully I'll go through with it soon.  As for home activities, one of the things I've decided to do is take up is programming. I've quit gaming, but there are still many reasons for me to have a computer and I absolutely love working with them. Most of my experience is via hardware, but I think it's time for me to start learning more about the software side of things. Someone on this subreddit mentioned ""Learn Python the Hard Way"". I've already started working through it during my free time here at home and am finding it thoroughly enjoyable and interesting. It's pretty incredible how it makes you think in a way that is fairly unique. On top of that, there is always browsing Reddit and YouTube, watching Netflix, watching sports, and the rest of the lot."

This is definitely something I'm very passionate about, so it's been a lot of fun to engage in the community over the past many years.  When you talk to your friends try to just keep it about you and not about gaming. You are going to take a break (even if you're moving on for good, a break is less aggressive to them) and find new channels to stay in touch with them in.  Programming is great. I'm a big fan of using our computer skills in other ways. :)"

StopGaming,34vadq,CamCan,2,Mon May 4 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Great name! :D  I love the idea of recording the letter you have for yourself. I'm going to recommend that to others in the future.   When you go to quit gaming you want to remember that you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have - so it's never really been about games themselves. When you go to quit you need to make sure you fulfill the needs gaming used to fulfill in new activities - otherwise you'll find yourself continuing to be drawn back to gaming since it's the traditional way you've fulfilled those needs. This article will help you understand the needs gaming fulfills.  So there are a few steps you want to take:   Uninstall/Delete your games. Choose new activities. Here is a thread w/ ideas. Setup a daily schedule. Try and be out of the house as much as possible where your temptations will be the lowest. Setup your badge.   Now when you choose new activities you want to make sure you pick a couple and set goals around them if you can. Goals are what will really help you with motivation and a sense of purpose.  The other thing you want to keep in mind is that you may experience cravings but that's ok, it's a normal part of the process. Just try to be mindful when you are having cravings and make sure during that time you are aware you're vulnerable. That's a good time to read your letter and get out of the house. I have a video on dealing with cravings here. (Meditation is highly recommended. Use the Headspace 10-day challenge to get started.)  Hope that helps!

For as long as I tried to handle it solo, I kept relapsing.  Even though I had plenty of good reasons and motivation to stop, even though I deleted and uninstalled everything, even though I was determined to turn my life around, I kept falling prey to my mind's relentless obsession.  Even when I was able to resist those urges 5, 10 and 20 times, it was still just a matter of time before I gave into one of them, for as long as I was going solo.

StopGaming,34uhzo,uSgViPeR,3,Mon May 4 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing. You're at 9 days, really proud of you!  You're right that this is the perfect opportunity for you to really push forward and grow in your ability to take ownership of your life and confront your demons.   I was in the same place when I quit so this is definitely the right path!  Meditation is one way of releasing this tension but you'll want to come up with a few different ones too. Gaming wasn't just a way for you to check out but also a way for you to socialize with others, be stimulated (mentally engaged) and to have a sense of purpose (you had a mission to go on)... so try and find a few other ways to get these experiences, especially now with your break-up.  Yoga would be great, it's a group activity that has a strong mindfulness component and you'll be able to make some friends.  Hiking or anything else in nature would also be good. Being in nature can have a calming effect on us.  Just know what you're experiencing right now after your break-up is normal and your desire to release it is normal too. But just as meditation teaches you to notice your thoughts and let them be, you want to do the same for your emotions now. Yes you want to release it but instead, just let it be.  I recorded a video on dealing with cravings that I think you'd find valuable. Even though you aren't necessarily having a ""craving"" in the traditional sense, a few of the exercises I recommend in the video would be good, especially the 3-steps to overcome resistance.  Hope that helps! You're not alone and I definitely relate to you. My first break-up I played games for a year to avoid dealing with the issues. My second break-up a few years later I no longer had games and had to deal with it head on... but I'm a better person now because of it!"

StopGaming,34uhwn,chrhall,1 point,Mon May 4 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that video game addiction needs to be viewed more seriously. At school we had quite a few talks on why drugs are bad and a few former drug addicts came in and gave speeches on the effect drugs had on their lives. Gaming addiction never really came up much at school however and myself and my classmates viewed gaming addiction as the kind of guy who spends all his free time gaming. Since this wasn't me I didn't view myself as an addict.  Overall gaming has had a significant negative impact on my life. I didn't do as well in school as I think I could've as I only revised enough to get okay grades. When I left school for college (I live in the UK, so high school) I continued my addiction and if anything it got worse. I'd only ensure I got my assignments up the level required to pass instead of chasing after merits and distinctions. I had really excessive amounts of free time during college as there were only two and a half days of lessons a week. So I had plenty of time to do assignment work, I just chose not to. Even at college I'd often spend time watching gaming videos or playing some shitty online game. I think at the peak of my addiction during college I was spending about 60 hours a week gaming. During my second year I cut back a bit but instead of choosing to fill that time doing assignment work I spent it reading instead. I graduated with a grade of MPP in engineering and since that wasn't enough to go to university (not that university appealed to me at the time) I tried to find an apprenticeship but wasn't sucessful.  I spent five months being unemployed after I completed my college course before I found a job. I spent a decent amount of time looking for work but even then I was using a lot of my time to escape reality by gaming/reading. Now I'm stuck in a dead end job being paid just above the minimum wage.  I suppose you could say I'm on a gap year right now. I've discovered quite a few things about myself. I accepted that I'm shy and now I'm trying to combat how much control this trait has control over my life. I've realised that I don't really want to pursue engineering as a career. I've discovered a passion that I have for history and I feel open to the idea of doing some course in history, despite my concerns over how beneficial it would be.  I think I've overcome gaming for a variety of reasons. Whilst I was unemployed I was reading an incredibly long and amazing book series called the wheel of time as well as gaming on the side. There were some really philosophical ideas and inspirational quotes in the books that led me to despise the really insignificant effect I had on the outside world whilst I was locked up in my room playing games.  Once I finished the books the depression that I'd been keeping locked down really started to surface and I went back to spending the majority of my free time gaming. Most importantly I started keeping a diary, at first it was just to record my reactions to the end of the wheel of time. But eventually the thoughts that I recorded got a bit deeper and I started to really evaluate my problems and what I wanted to do with my life. After about five entries I came to the realisation that I wanted to stop gaming all together, I had tried moderation in the past but it had never really worked for me.  Now that I've stopped gaming altogether and uninstalled my games, I feel like I'm taking positive steps in my life and hopefully I'll be in a much better place in six months time.  Yeah, I feel like there should be help offered to overcome gaming addiction. This subreddit offers some great advice and is very friendly. I haven't really heard of any kind of support groups in local communities though. I suppose there might be some, but not very many. I don't think the biggest issue is getting support to overcome the addiction however as the awareness levels for gaming addiction seem very low to me. I think many addicts are in denial about being addicted. I know I was in denial as my parents often told me that I was addicted despite me continuously disputing the fact.  Maybe some gaming addicts are aware that they are addicts but just don't care, nor have the desire to change. I don't think much can be done to help these kinds of people. I do believe however that there are thousands possibly millions of gamers who have a little voice inside their heads screaming at them to give up gaming/cut back and pick up some new hobbies.  I suppose I'd be pleased if you included my thoughts in your thesis, after I spent quite some time writing them out, haha. But honestly I wouldn't mind if you didn't, I enjoy getting my thoughts out on paper and I do like writing in general.  Edit: Yeah, just realised how long this is, probably my longest comment ever. I suppose you could cut it down if you do want to include it."

Don’t worry about it being too long, you gave a lot of interesting points that I definitely will be able to use.   What you write seems to echo what a lot of other game addicts say – that their gaming started as a sort of escape from reality and then became excessive. I also agree that the awareness concerning game addiction is very low and that many are in denial (or just don’t realize how damaging their playing is). However, from what I can tell there seems to be an increase in awareness and the amount of help and treatment being offered. Hopefully it will be looked upon more seriously in a couple of years.

The key is to re-focus on why you quit in the first place. Sometimes when you quit your initial motivation was just to get away from games... but over time when you don't feel that emotional pull in the same way it's important to ""update"" your reasons why you don't want to play.  So for me it wasn't just about not playing games or because games were causing major negatives to my life... (even though they were)... but over time I focused more on what new goals and dreams I had now that I had all this time without games to invest somewhere.  Remember, it wasn't about games in the first place, just what games were fulfilling for you. One of those things was that games were a great way to kill time, so now that you aren't gaming it's really about focusing on the new priorities you have, instead of just on ""not playing.""

I think part of the problem we run into when we quit is that gaming has always been our ""go-to""... so now that you aren't feeling more of the negative emotional/physical side of moving on from games you are in more of a place of: ""Wow, I feel good and I have all this time"" which our habit is to go and game.  So now it's just re-focusing on thinking about this notion that: ""I feel good and I have all this time"" and now considering what you really do want to invest your time into.

Gaming was a major reason why I dropped out so I definitely relate to how you're feeling. (I shared my story here.)  Definitely do what you can to fix the situation. Moving on from games is step one.  Next you'll want to speak with your school counsellor and get them on your team. You can be honest with them that you know you've made mistakes and you'd like to make up for them.  If you need to take classes during the summer that's fine. There's nothing wrong with it.  Most of all you need to know that the true test in life is whether or not you're able to overcome adversity. Yes, you're in the situation you are BUT you are able to overcome it and by doing so you will learn a lot about yourself and it will help you grow and become a better version of yourself.  There are many people in your life you can find, whether they are school counsellors, teachers or other adults you can trust that will help you move forward.  To move on from games you want to do the following:   Uninstall/Delete your games. Choose new activities. Here is a thread w/ ideas. Setup a daily schedule. Try and be out of the house as much as possible where your temptations will be the lowest. Setup your badge.   It's important to still know what other activities you'll do are because gaming fulfilled certain needs you had, so if you don't find new activities to replace gaming you'll fall back into it.  Yes a lot of your time should be in your school work but one of the reasons why you gamed was to avoid your schoolwork so don't expect your schoolwork to just replace gaming. You also need to have a few other activities you can do.  I recommend reading this article on how to quit gaming and I have many YouTube videos to help you too.

Thank you for all the tips and I've subbed to your channel :)  I'm going to speak to my school counselors and see if we can work something out.   Off topic : What did you do after you left high school?
StopGaming,34rbp4,camerondare,2,Sun May 3 22:30:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome! A major part of why I dropped out other than gaming was because of bullying I experienced. Not sure if you know but I did a second TEDx talk where I share that story + more of what I've done since then.  When I left school I gamed for about a year and a half before I quit. So that was basically me sitting in my parents basement playing games and working the odd job here and there.  Once I quit gaming I decided to get my **** together, and got a stable job at H&M for a year. During this time I worked a lot on my social skills and confidence. Then I quit and launched my own business which I've been doing over the past six years+ now.  Here's some more details about that whole journey:  A brief overview of how I make my income online.  Before I do that what I want you to know is that before I did any of this I focused on what I wanted from my life. And really it came down to freedom and flexibility in my time. I wanted the option to be spontaneous and take the weekend off or to not have to make that awkward phone call to work when I was sick. So really I wanted to work for myself.  Now that I knew I wanted to work for myself I started trying to figure out how to do that. Essentially I needed to start my own business. At first I had no idea what to do for a business, I had no skills and I hadn't even graduated high school (I dropped out twice due to gaming and never went back.) I was 19ish at the time.  So if I wanted to work for myself I needed to start my own business and if I wanted my own business I needed something to sell people. I know that seems like common sense but that's the extent of the model.  Now what should I sell? That was what I needed to figure out and the easiest way to find this is by focusing on someone else's pain. If you can solve someone's pain, you can create a new business. There's many different examples of this.  All I did was begin to explore this question and luckily at the time I was learning how to improve my social skills and helped to organize a meetup every week, so I was finding other guys who had similar struggles. They started to ask me to coach and I launched a business. When I started I had no idea what I was doing, no biz experience or anything, so I did the only thing I could: learn on the fly.  So I read books and applied it to my experience. I'll list a few good ones below.  1) For six years I've had a company called Kingpin Social where I worked with guys (mainly between 24-32 years old) to help them improve their social skills, relationships and lifestyle. In 2012 we had six full time employees and it was a six-figure business.  2) Freelance/Web Design work. This is mainly for friends who want help with it and I outsource all the work, taking my cut for being the project manager. I also write for addiction.com and they pay me per article.  3) Wheat Free Mom. I have a site with my mom where we share gluten free recipes. We have cookbooks, etc. She creates the recipes, I do all the rest mostly.  4) Game Quitters. This is my new venture and the project I'm dedicating the majority of my time towards. Just building resources and tools to support the community. I've been answering questions on the topic since 2011 when I released my article on How to Quit Playing Video Games FOREVER and now I'm dedicating time to creating more value for the community.  I'm heading to Bali to write a book on the subject. I hope to leverage the book into speaking engagements at high schools around the world. I have a guide I put together as the follow-up to my article called Respawn and in the next few weeks I plan to release the Game Quitters Challenge.  Multiple streams is really the key. They all add up over time. The key is to focus on developing different skills that you can offer as services. And then learning how to leverage outsourcing and other people with skills so you can add additional services, etc.  If you're interested in learning more about entrepreneurship, be it for a side business (recommended) or something more full-time, here are a few resources:  The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau.  The Art of Non-Conformity by Chris Guillebeau  Tim Ferriss' Blog  Chris Guillebeau's blog  Sean Ogle's blog: Location 180  There are also a number of good podcasts to listen to:  Internet Business Mastery  Smart Passive Income with Pat Flynn  Hope that helps you out."

StopGaming,34rbp4,BrighterthanMoon,2,Mon May 4 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"I had a very low GPA in high school because I used to play video games 24/7 and did not go to school. I had a major depression during that time with some suicidal attempts. But then one day, I received a letter that if I don't go to high school furthermore, I would be expelled. For some reason, I hated the word ""expelled"" so I decided to go, at my last year. While I was at it I tried to do the works to improve my GPA in order to not get expelled from my school. And I'm so glad I did because I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at my 3rd year and I believe I'm doing very well. I'm expecting to graduate with a 3.7 GPA by my 4th year. It was a tough road to catch up for college and stuff, but the decision for me to continue to go through high school is the reason why I'm here, studying something I love (which is something I found while I was in College. So don't worry about what you love right now).   Don't give up! There is a whole LIFE waiting for you. And it only keeps getting better as long as you don't quit and start being optimistic. People change. You can change. And most change for the better. Be the better."

StopGaming,34rbp4,robots-dont-lie,2,Sun May 3 22:45:45 2015 UTC,"Your junior year is definitely your most important year of high school. If you can improve and do well your junior year I think you'll be good to go for college or other post-high school learning programs (if you are planning on applying), admissions officers love to see improvement and they mainly want to see that you are capable of success.  I definitely don't think it's rational for you to lose hope at this point - your next year is more important than this one, and if you can demonstrate that you are a capable student you will be viewed as one. Once you get out of high school and into your next stage of life, your high school record doesn't matter at all. For example if you go to a college and do well, you will be viewed as a good student no matter what your high school GPA was."
StopGaming,34rl0i,waste2muchtime,4,Sun May 3 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"It depends on you - does playing those games hook you to the point that you lose track of time and end up playing for several hours without meaning to, or can you just jump in and out on your own terms?

I feel like there are much better solutions for relaxation and distressing than video games. Video games may help you relax sometimes, but they also promote escapism and can make you feel even more stressful or even angry depending on how your gaming session went.   And remember, we're on /r/stopgaming. I think everybody on here wants to quit gaming for one reason or another. Trying to come up with a list of video games that are exceptions is just giving into cravings."

But to be honest Ive been cheating!  I meant to reset my badge but forgot until you said something.. the shame :(   I dont over play anymore but I hate that video games are my baseline you know? I want my baseline to be relaxing with family or cleaning or god forbid nothing at all. My longest stent was a year. Not thinking of video games was like someone turning off a buzzing florescent light in my mind...it was a relief.
StopGaming,34rl0i,Smircio-,1 point,Mon May 4 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"I've definitely been in a place where I saw video games as a touchstone, or my home base if you will. If I couldn't go to games, I felt anxious and frustrated. A day wouldn't feel complete if I was kept away from games. It felt like a detox almost, I needed games to detox. I recently read quite a lot about Buddhism and that lead me to meditation and mindfulness. Those are the things that have made it so I don't need to play games any more. They are still there for me, but they just don't have that same pull any more. Most of the time I simply choose not to play games as I'd prefer to read or meditate. It was only once I stopped that I noticed the horrible effect gaming had on me. I had become attached and dependant, so when they were gone I felt the void full force. Now that void and the cravings are both gone.  Don't worry too much about your badge. I know most people like to keep track and humans intrinsically love seeing numbers progress but just like games, I find that these numbers can also create an unhealthy bond. I tend to become attached to them, and when the number goes down I feel awful. I find it much more powerful to base my progress simply on how I feel. I started doing the same thing with my weight too. Stopped weighing myself, and just went by how I felt.   Good luck in your quest, and regardless of your badge not being entirely accurate, well done on your progress."

StopGaming,34qt6x,Thunderbudz,3,Sun May 3 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing! This can be a normal part of the process so don't worry about it too much. The important thing is you were mindful enough to recognize whether you were falling back into the trap or not, and it's this ability to catch yourself that is so crucial over the long term. It's your ability to hold yourself accountable.  Re-focus on moving forward without games. The key isn't only to find new hobbies and activities to do... but to turn them into a project and set goals. That helps give you a greater sense of purpose and will help motivation. What's a goal you have for guitar? :)"
StopGaming,34qt6x,camerondare,2,Sun May 3 19:54:41 2015 UTC,"Hey! I just watched 2 of your videos, 13 and 11 about other activities.  I've been trying to set goals with my other activities minorly in more of a 15 - 30 minutes a day doing these other activities and it hasn't gone terribly. However, about a month ago i started working way longer hours for a big project at school and I just haven't felt all that relaxed while doing my other activities. The biggest one that i've really been trying hard to work on has been reading and it does help me to sleep a bit quicker but I just can't get into the books i've picked out. Maybe it is just a matter of persevering through it or just to keep looking but i get more and more frustrated (with reading in particular) at my lack of interest. I think you probably hit the nail on the head about finding other activities enjoyable and that was probably a big reason why i went back to playing. It was easy to use the excuse ""Oh i've worked long, and i am not really enjoying this other thing, so i'll just play for 30 minutes, i know i like it and i know i relax a little when i play"". Anyways, all that being said, i liked your advice in your videos and i think it might make more sense for me to look at guitar more in terms of learning to play songs and maybe setting up a list of songs that i want to learn over a couple of weeks as those are slightly bigger goals that have minor milestones in between like techniques which could get me further in the long run."
StopGaming,34qt6x,camerondare,3,Sun May 3 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for checking them out, I'm glad you found them to be insightful.  I definitely think your new plan is the right way to go. Having a daily milestone of playing/reading for 30 minutes is great and you want to have that type of goal too (more of the habit you're developing...) but you also want to have a bigger reason why you are putting that time in.  That's where the song list (or book list) can come in. And then you can take it to another step and add Leverage (also known as Stakes), where for example you sign up for an open mic night in a months time so you have to learn the song you will be playing.  One of my favorite examples is from my friend named Tyrone. When he quit gaming he wasn't sure what he was going to do with his time, and on top of that he was about to go to his first year of university (he'd have no friends)... so he was really nervous about quitting.  So when he quit he ended up becoming interested in learning Chinese and at first started with something simple like Duolingo - kinda like how you are using Rocksmith.  Then as he became more interested he joined the Chinese club at school and that not only helped him learn more Chinese but it also had a huge impact on his social life. Now he had friends to hang out with, and as he interacted more with real Chinese people (vs. just the computer on Duolingo) he also became more interested in Chinese culture + he wanted to get even better at the language.  So he signed up for a test to hold him accountable to furthering his language and then decided to book a trip to China for 7 weeks this summer during his vacation.  Now not only did he have a test to hold him accountable but now he really wanted to learn as much as he could so he could speak while he was there.  Anyways, bit of a long story but that's some of the process you want to go through. And by taking these a step further you'll develop more of a passion in the activity.   And passion will manifest in different ways, now I know Tyrone watches Chinese movies, reads Chinese books, etc. So it isn't just strictly him learning the language.  I guess lastly something to keep in mind is that your needs will shift over time so it's really about adapting to the changing landscape. For example, I don't watch that much TV when I'm at ""home"" - I have many other things I can do to relax... but when  I'm traveling I tend to watch a TV show at night because it makes me feel more ""at home.""   Also when I travel I don't have DJing (one of my passions) so I have to adapt and find new ways to fulfill the needs DJing did. It's really about being mindful of your experience and current situation and responding accordingly.  :)"

StopGaming,34nkis,TylerHadd,2,Sun May 3 02:01:46 2015 UTC,Couch-to-5k is cool! Definitely a good start. I also like hiking because it's less fitness focused but it still gets you outside playing in nature and you get in better shape naturally.

StopGaming,34nkis,camerondare,1 point,Sun May 3 02:40:44 2015 UTC,Hiking was one of the first things I tried after quitting and let me tell you...  IT'S AWESOME TO THE MAX!!  So relaxing and energizing to be walking out there with nature. It also helps me get rid of huge amounts of stress and my mind just explores while doing it.  I highly recommend starting on simple nature trails and then build up from there.
StopGaming,34nkis,coconut_radio,1 point,Mon May 4 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Nothing is more amazing then being deep in a forest and just listening to the winds blow through the trees. I did a tiny little half mile(I think) trail yesterday and saw some deer about 30-50 ft away from me! I tried to sneak closer, but as soon as i stepped off the trail it became very clear to me that I need a lot of practice to be able to walk through leaves without making any noise, lol.  Anyway, on another note, I think hiking is PERFECT for gamers trying to quit, because doing a trail and reaching the end gives you the same exact sense of accomplishment that video games give you that makes them so addicting. Seriously, if anyone is reading this and is trying to find a way to fill the void of free time granted from quitting games, find a park somewhere. Find out what trails are there, and start with the small ones and progressively work your way up until you can tackle the biggest trail in the park! It will give a great sense of progress/accomplishment the same way leveling up in wow did. In fact, I would not hesitate to say that the sense of accomplishment it gives you is better than when you hit 100 on a character in wow. I personally plan to start going to going to Bernheim forest and hike every single trail there once I get at least half way into my couch-to-5k program. I'll build up to the point where I go for the 13 mile long Millennium trail! Just look for a park like this one near your town and you will not regret going there.  By the way coconut, I hope you don't mind me asking; did you hike alone or did you hike with friends? I personally like to hike solo, because being alone in the woods is one of the most stress relieving, amazing feelings I think I've ever had. Just don't read anything on r/nosleep before you do it. It really gives you time alone with you and your mind to think. Hopefully one of these days I get to the backpacking level, and can do the insanely long trails like the Appalachian or pacific northwest trail. Now that would be a fucking amazing experience! Lol."
StopGaming,34nkis,TylerHadd,1 point,Tue May 5 01:16:53 2015 UTC,Depends on the difficulty and how frequently other people hike the same trail.  If I know that there will be plenty of people coming across you or the hike is just simply a walk along a clear path I go alone.  When I want to do something I haven't done before and is more challenging I bring others who want to join.  Back packing sounds so awesome. I hope to backpack Europe. I also want to see the different kinds of nature throughout the States.

One of the main reasons why I played games was because I was bullied a lot during school so I found comfort online. (I shared my story here.)  Anyways, when I quit it was because I was determined to start living a life I was proud of, one where I pursued my goals and dreams instead of just wasting my days playing games and avoiding going after what I really wanted in the world.  And looking back now I'm so glad I did because it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  It's important to know that you play games for specific reasons - they fulfill certain needs you have - so to move on you need to find new activities that fulfill these same needs. You can learn more about the needs here.  Here are some next steps:   Uninstall/Delete your games. Choose new activities. Here is a thread w/ ideas. Setup a daily schedule. Try and be out of the house as much as possible where your temptations will be the lowest.   Congrats on day one. Let us know if we can do anything to help! We're all in this together.

I so desperately wanted to run from my uncomfortable feelings and avoid life in general that I kept coming back for the instant gratification, the pretense of achievement/progress, the social aspect and what not.  I'm now at a point where I want to make the time that I have meaningful, and that I can't keep running from the pain. It's a very tough decision, and I've still got a long way to go, but I haven't looked back and I can tell you that It's worth every step of the way.  You can do this. Don't be discouraged because the first week (especially the first few days) is very, very hard. Don't replace your gaming habits with watching streams/videos or anything of the sort.

The thing is... when we quit gaming one of the challenges we face isn't only finding new activities to replace gaming but finding ones we actually enjoy other than gaming.  And this can be a huge challenge! Part of us feels like the reason this happens is because we only enjoy gaming and it's a passion we have... but the truth is that there are actual reasons other than that that contribute to this problem.  So in this weeks video I go through three of the reasons why, one of them is an environmental reason and the other two are actual brain chemistry changes you have from gaming overload that cause you to find other activities to be boring.  So check it out and let me know what you think in the comments. Sorry for the delay getting the video out this week, I've been sick... which you'll also hear as my voice squeaks throughout the video. :X  Let's have a great weekend and let me know if there are any other questions you want me to feature in the future! :D"

If you have the mental condition of addiction, as I do, as described in ASAM's definition of addiction, then the good news is that there is a treatment for it.  Do you find yourself relating to the definition?  You can also take this self test for game addiction.  The best thing to do is find people who have had the same problems but have successfully overcome them, and then try out their suggestions.  Keep posting here and check out some CGAA meetings.  I spent a year trying to stop on my own or to moderate, and failed with both.  I spent another two years trying to stop after finding CGAA but I had some reservations and didn't take my situation very seriously.  I stopped for months at a time, but then would relapse for months at a time.  After hitting a very painful bottom where my lack of control and terrible decision making really scared me, I finally accepted the seriousness of my condition and started doing the footwork in CGAA.  In the three years since, I haven't played a game.  Many others have stopped for months and years.  You can too."

I only recently stopped and there's a million games I would love to be playing right now and I have plenty of time to do so but I know the only way to get through it is to show yourself that even when you really want to play and have no good reason not to, you can use your willpower to just stay away from them.

I know it's hard to imagine giving up something that's a huge part of your life. But I also know you can totally succeed if you try. It's your addiction itself that is telling you to wait three or four months. You don't need to get a new computer or some other complicated goal in order to quit now. All you need to do is delete your games. Tonight. I know it's hard. But I know you can do it. This last week has been amazing for me. I've always dreamt of being a writer and within two days I've felt a huge wellspring of creativity. I've been writing. My head is clearer than it's been in as long as I can remember. I find I can focus on random hobbies with all my attention instead of just part of it. I enjoy everyone's company so much more because no one is keeping me from another game. I never have anywhere to be but wherever I am right now. I'm 32 and every day I've had since quitting has felt unbelievably precious and real. While I was addicted, every night was filled with regret and frustration. All that disappeared when I quit. It isn't easy. I still feel the desire to play, but I'm pushing through. I want to give myself this chance to feel really alive, and you should too."

My reason to quit ended up being that it has stolen my teenage years and now I realized that I would never want to get in a relationship with anyone who played games as much as me. After that i decided to make myself a list of what to do with my life instead, this is crucial because if you don't find something you will enjoy killing your time with instead you will fall into the same trend. For me that has meant becoming an excellent musician going on walks and runs frequently and finding movies/books i genuinely enjoy. If the gym works for you that is good but you need to find something you can become better at and something to pass your bored hours with. When I followed the advice of the link it allowed me to instantly uninstall every single game i owned and now I feel like a different person, and I genuinely feel like i have a better life now.

Thanks for sharing! :)  The key with video games is to know that we play games for specific reasons - they fulfill needs we have - so it's not necessarily about games but about why we play. You've already gone ahead and identified more about why you play and now you need to fulfill these needs in new activities.  It's good that you have new goals too, that will help you with your sense of purpose and motivation. One tip I'd give you is to make sure you schedule your time. Like you said, you game when you are bored or don't have anything else to do (free time)... so a trick I've found to avoid this is to schedule my day full of the new activities I want to focus on... so I avoid the trap of not knowing what to do with my time. :)  We're in this together, let me know if you need any help!"

For example, I started doing Origami, learning to solve the Rubik's cube and Woodwhitting. Now I'm a origami intermediate (not a master but good at it), an expert cuber (I now have 12 cubes and deduce the algorhythms to solve them) and I'm getting better at woodwhitting every time I do it.

It sounds like you realize that our struggles have been just as hard as yours (perhaps harder in your opinion); I don't think anyone is gonna brush you off here. All our addictions seem trivial relative to alcohol and hard drug use, right? None the less, we don't let the seeming smallness of our addiction get us down. The fact is; our behaviors are unhealthy, chronic, and really fucking hard to stop; regardless if we imagine society laughing at our frailty.  People here have made great sacrifices to stop the downward spiral and that's what you probably need to do as well. Delete and deep 6 your accounts.

This went on and off for ~10 months, I even contacted the games service department and asked them to delete my account, they responded that couldn't do it and didn't understand why I would want to anyways. Eventually I realized I could delete my account by starting from the beginning and essentially overwriting all my process on my account. I did that (it was hard) and had zero motivation to start from the beginning again. Slowly I thought about it less and less everyday until now I have no desire to play whatsoever.

It was initially written (and entitled simply ""Fairy Stories"") for presentation by Tolkien as the Andrew Lang lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, in 1939. It first appeared in print, with some enhancement, in 1947, in a festschrift volume, Essays Presented to Charles Williams, compiled by C. S. Lewis. Charles Williams, a friend of Lewis's, had been relocated with the Oxford University Press staff from London to Oxford during the London blitz in World War II. This allowed him to participate in gatherings of the Inklings with Lewis and Tolkien. The volume of essays was intended to be presented to Williams upon the return of the OUP staff to London with the ending of the war. However, Williams died suddenly on 15 May 1945, and the book was published as a memorial volume.

Part of why this happens is because they become triggered and defensive (like your friend has) about their own gaming habits, and if you quit than it says something about them. Even though that's not true they can react that way.  But what you want to know is that you have a desire to quit and you are allowed to make that decision for yourself. You don't have to justify it to anybody, especially not yourself.  Now you will find some friends will be supportive and others will not, so the ones who are continue to interact with them (find new channels like FB or Skype) and the ones who are not supportive you want to create a boundary around - either only engage with them in new channels (away from gaming) and try to keep the conversation from being about gaming, and if they are discouraging you from quitting than you may want to take a break from them for a period of time.  Most importantly when you quit you want to also focus on making new friends so you don't feel that sense of loss from your current gamer friends in the same way, and also have other friends who have similar interests to you. The easiest way to do this is by joining social activities. This can be clubs at school or meetups.  I also recorded a video on this exact topic recently so check that out if you want."

It's a completely contrived anger and your mom and all your relationships deserve so much more from you.  It's super tough to lose friends, but he's not treating you fairly and you can't let his desires affect you through his manipulation. You know why you're quitting, you just can't articulate it well enough for him. You will soon. When you do, you can maintain the conversation with him.

No explanation, no arguments, simply state the fact that you're quitting gaming and set the norm that you don't want him to drag you into gaming again. There's no need for you to justify your choices to him, so don't let him lure you into discussion. This only works, however, if you are completely sure that you're quitting.

He said something to the effect of, ""Why don't you just moderate yourself?!"" I eventually caved (I forget how much peer pressure had to do with it). The second time I quit I didnt tell him. So he asked me to play one day to which I told him I quit And I wasn't going to play for at least a 3months. I told him Cam and a substance abuse therapist I started seeing at school suggested it to allow my dopamine network to renetwork itself.  After he heard that he didn't say shit; he didn't say anything supportive but hell after what he said the first time I'll take acquiescing as improvement. Others I played with supported me actually. They said it sucked that it came to this but they understood. They all were very good at moderating their usage while I wasn't. We're all oldish gamer nerds though so from time to time we have grown up responses to things not going our way all the time. I told my parents and some other friends about it too and they definitely helped quash the dissenting voice.

StopGaming,34eh4t,tmnn91,2,Thu Apr 30 14:09:23 2015 UTC,"I started gaming very early, as I was around 6 or so. I began small as a casual player, half an hour a day. But it slowly consumed more and more time. My parents limited me at first, but it didn't really matter. I stopped reading books and played more and more. Gaming was great for me. It was fast, clean fun, without any visible short-time consequences. After almost 10 years of gaming, I realized the consequences I tried to suppress. I had not gained any social ability. My social skills were still at the level of a primary school attendant. One thing that really bugs me, is the naturalness of gaming in our society. In my current class, 80% of all students are gaming and the rest of them is doing drugs. Just the girls are not gaming. And me. This really makes a person not gaming an outsider, and I think exactly this makes stopping quite hard. After I told people in my class I wasn't gaming anymore, many of them could not understand why. They could not think of any ways I could spend my time without playing games.  I would never force anyone to stop gaming. Do I think gaming is bad? Hell yeah. But to each his own."
StopGaming,34eh4t,dxkpf,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:15:46 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you're trying to ask.  To a large extent gaming became more fun than anything else for us. We invested too much in it and now had nothing else.  Problems at school or with family are main reasons (I assume) we wanted to escape to gaming in our youth. I'm not sure how support would go unless you felt really safe in those environments.
StopGaming,34eh4t,freekeypress,1 point,Fri May 1 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"I would like to ask you guys/girls what it is that you think allowed you to fall into your addiction?   Escapism, the sweet promise of a hiding hole I could run to, if problems in the real world appeared. And there were plenty of problems, considering that I was bullied at school and generally the ""Omega"" of the pack. But gaming also provided an easy way for me to procrastinate and I had issues with procrastination every second of my life that I can remember. (Did I mention that I wanted to respond to this thread yesterday?)  I mean, I got caught up in daydreams, binge-reading of books and playing singleplayer games before, but it never got to the point that I would have considered it ""destructive"" or ""addictive"" behaviour. Simply because each of these activities came to a natural end, eventually.   Is there something in the early stages of your gaming habits that lead you to the point where it became a problem?    What exactly do you mean with that?    Would you have liked support from school/your family?   I have been in denial for a very long time. If someone would have tried to help me (back then, my parents did, in fact - and they are supporting me now) I would have just gotten defensive, resulting in a pointless argument. Deep down I was ashamed of all that and that was a reason I tried to hide my addiction, to hide how much time I have really spent.  After a while I realized that I had a problem (I always called it ""problem"", it took even longer to face the truth that it was, in fact, an addiction) but tried to solve it on my own and still denied it's existance to anyone else. And then there was a time where I finally admitted that I couldn't turn things around on my own - but I was still crippled by shame and fear. Only in that stage it would have helped if someone reached out and tried to talk to me about it.  Long story short: You can't support or help someone that does not admit to having a problem."
StopGaming,34eh4t,Borcarbid,1 point,Fri May 1 08:59:59 2015 UTC,"I started gaming very young, maybe ~7 or so. Way back then it wasn't a problem because I had a sport in my life -- baseball. I didn't play games to an unsafe degree, the best I could get away with was maybe two hours in one day, which when you look at me today that amount is nothing. As I got older, the baseball got more and more competitive(which meant much more time-consuming) and at the same time I started enjoying games more and more. It wasn't long until I enjoyed games more than I enjoyed baseball. Every practice I went to and eventually every game I played became a burden of boredom and just something blocking me from my games. After the season when I was 12, my parents allowed me to quit after my season before that when they didn't let me quit. I wish like hell my parents didn't let me quit baseball and forced me to keep going, because after I quit baseball was when I slipped into addiction-level gaming. I hate to admit it, but I guess it's safe to say it here. I stopped socially developing after I quit baseball. I made friends just like any other kid, but they were almost all online. Back when I was that young, my only friends were my neighbors down the street and a circle of about 8 friends or so in school. As my life progressed, I ended up with less and less friends(not including my online friends). Now, while other people my age were out playing sports or whatever that led them to making friends in real life, I was sitting at my computer making friends that I would never meet outside the internet. Those other kids were socially developing while I wasn't. Talking to someone online is not the same thing at all as talking to someone in real life. So because of the fact that the ratio between RL friends and ""fake"" friends kept growing steeper, my addiction also kept growing steeper. It got to the point where on the weekends I would literally get up from bed, and plop right down on my chair. And sit there. Until the sun went down. And then sit there until the dead middle of the night, we're talking 4 AM. Only taking breaks for meals. I don't see why in the hell it took me so long to see how pathetic this life was, but I didn't. I'm 17 now, very close to 18. I've only very recently gotten sick and disgusted of my lifestyle, and I'm planning to fix it once this school year ends and I graduate from high school. I will be working with my dad's company all summer out of town, helping him run baseball tourneys all over the country. When I get back, I'm not going to touch any of my games. I'm going to start learning how to fly planes, go to college, and start working a job to pay for tuition.  Sorry if i ranted away from the actual question there, I just felt like getting some of that off my chest. To put it shortly, at least from my experiences, video game addiction comes from being a youngster who doesn't understand or care about the difference between RL friends and online friends, and spends all his time talking to his online friends until he has no more RL friends to do anything with, so when you became aware of this mistake you've made, you can't really do anything about it because at that point you're to socially estranged from the rest of the world... so all you can do is go back to the online gaming world where you aren't socially estranged. And keep playing games. All fucking day. Getting that dopamine rush for leveling up, which encourages you to keep playing, even though none of it means jack shit."

Some use the argument that gaming helps you to think faster but martial art will do the same plus will help get you fit and interact with people eye to eye.

I regret not doing better in school because I could have given myself a way better college experience. I never really improved when college came and still had the bad study habits. It's funny because once I graduated college and was thrown into the real world I finally saw how little I enjoyed video games. They never really benefited me in the real world, and all that time I spent could have gone to better hobbies or activities.   Edit: also after seeing /u/shorterthanaverge post. I will say all of my friends also played video games. My friends and I still play Evolve together from time to time. It's hard to say honestly, because on one hand it's hanging with your friends. On the other hand it's basically like co-dependent abuse of your time playing video games. I get that video games are fun, but looking back I wish I cut back on the video games and spent a little more time studying and exercising and the amount of ""fun"" I would have had in college would have been way more.  Video games are fun, but it's really like a fall back when you don't really have anything else ""fun"" going on, and eventually you're not much different than the stoner who sits on the couch watching tv all day.   It's good to get interaction through people who aren't your friends.

What I did find though, which was very consistent, every time I picked it back up it was HARDCORE MODE ENABLED! And I took pride in that sort of attitude. I'd justify it as I was ""rewarding"" myself after going so long without.  These binges could last days, weeks even months too. And while this was ENABLED, everything else in my life suffered.   I also relate to the emotional attachment. I'm 33. I began with NES too. Just about all the best consoles every generation since and loads of PC games too. I have many fond memories of the classic games, the music in them, the stories. I can and would associate significant milestones in my life to this point with what games were out and what I was playing at the time. That emotional attachment also made it very hard to quit.

StopGaming,349b8t,Borcarbid,2,Thu Apr 30 07:47:56 2015 UTC,"A few things can really make a difference here. Firstly, I was in your situation for the first several years of college, literally paying for my problems with student loans wasted on not getting good grades and gaming instead.   The first thing that can make a difference is a vision. Sit yourself down with a pen and paper and plan out where you want to see yourself in one, two, five, and ten years from now. This will help set the foundation for true, good, healthy change. You're finishing up high school, so the one or two year marks should involve graduating, and figuring out how you want to get started with adult life.   Do you want to go to college/can you afford it? Plan to research what kind of job requiring a 4-year degree you want to have. If you don't plan on going to college/can't afford it, think about a trade like welding or HVAC or electrician or something else skilled, and plan for the steps to get there. Again, if you do plan on college, research degree choices by jobs using those degrees and placement rates. I must emphasize this. Most of my problems now result from going into college without and end-game plan. You'll want a good return for your time and effort at college. All of this falls into place for the five year planning.    The ten year planning results in the motivation for all the prior milestones. At 10 years you may want a new car or house, to start a family. Or go travel the world. Your dreams about ten years out are to be the source of your motivation now. And motivation is everything.   I believe in the big picture, because addictions tend to change our focus into the right now, making us make decisions that benefit us now and hurt us later. Starting with the big picture and working down all the way to the day-to-day tasks has helped me stay away from gaming as an addiction, and to turn my life around,  and I believe it can help you,  too."

For many years I always thought I was lazy and lacked willpower. It affected my self-image and confidence and every time I tried quitting games and couldn't stick with it, that was just one more knife in my heart. Until I started addressing my issue as being an addiction, treating it as an addiction, I continued to believe my willpower was crap. In reality, your willpower is not bad at all. In fact, I'm willing to bet you'll surprise yourself down the road after not being in active addiction for a good time.  It's tough to quit. Even with the accountability we can get from /r/StopGaming - because it's very easy not to click on this link. It's very easy for me to just lapse and not check in. There are other things I had to work on and deeper accountability I needed.   I wish you luck in your journey. Some great advice here on setting a new focus in life but keep in mind, if you are truly suffering from an addiction in the real sense, then plans and goals and lists and check-ins are never going to help, believe me.  If you are curious how I do it, then check out our fellowship's website for Video Game Addicts  We meet, we talk on phone, we work the 12 steps, and that has been the only method I've ever seen for any real addict to live a life that isn't in a constant state of struggle and temptation."

There is a difference between problem gamers and one who has crossed the line into addiction and with problem gamers, I'd never suggest recovery, lifestyle changes indeed are the right course. In my experience as an addict, I tried many times to tackle the ""real issues"" in my life and moderating gaming was usually somehow involved, and sadly it never worked. I'm 33 years old and have been gaming since 15, if there was any other answer for me I wouldn't be here and I'd be happily enjoying moderate game sessions while successfully managing my life. I'm not stupid nor is any addict, the issues and lifestyle changes needed have obviously been attempted and sadly never stick."

There is a difference between problem gamers and one who has crossed the line into addiction and with problem gamers, I'd never suggest recovery, lifestyle changes indeed are the right course.   Those representing CGAA should be much more upfront about this in all of your posts. There are far too many kids under the age of 18 on this forum (that have no professional or adult supervision) and to withhold this type of disclaimer in your posts encouraging CGAA/Video Game Addiction is bordering unethical at this point.  The difference between the percentage of gamers on this forum who have the mental condition of addiction who need a professional recovery program and the percentage of whom are problematic gamers (of which as you've said, lifestyle changes are indeed the right course) is vast and I hope in the future you will all take a more honest approach to all of your posts.  I appreciate the fact that you and others have found peace through the CGAA recovery program, and by no means am I trying to suggest it's not a valid approach, but I do believe your lack of transparency, specifically when it comes to the difference between being an addict and a problematic gamer, combined with the young age of many on this forum is dangerous.  If your intention is to help those who struggle to move on from gaming than help. In the cases you identify where CGAA is appropriate, recommend it and also encourage them to seek professional supervision. And in the cases where the mental condition of addiction is not identified, be weary of recommending a recovery program and encourage lifestyle changes. Be a friend.  There are (many) kids on this forum in the midst of the most important years of identity formation, they are scared and vulnerable. Because of this it's that much more important we act with caution and professionalism in anything we suggest. They need encouragement and support, not to told they are an addict when they are not.  I hope we can all take a step back and remember why we're here: to help people move on from games. Let's take this as a responsibility with honest sincerity."

I was even discussing this with someone today and how /r/StopGaming is absolutely more problem gamers than true addicts. I always feel a bit nervous responding here, as its not my intention to come across as preachy or dishonest.  I mention addiction only so its something people are aware can be a part to play. Also - many people here misuse that term, I'm not casting blame, but I see many people who use the term ""addict"" when from your perspective, they may simply be a problem gamer.   It's definitely something worth being cautious about but I'd say its just as reckless to tell a real addict that they can be ""cured"" by simply making a few lifestyle changes.   Again though, I appreciate your opinion. I'll be sure to use that ""disclaimer""/clarification from now on."

I definitely agree with you about the misuse of the term addiction and /r/StopGaming isn't the only place it happens but really with the entire general public. It's admittedly a mistake I have made as well with my TEDx talk, and since then I've made a much more concerted effort to be more intentional with the language I'm personally contributing to.  I also agree with not simply encouraging lifestyle changes as the cure to a real addict, as I have close friends and family members whom are addicts and I've seen the importance of recovery programs - I just think it's important, especially when it comes to /r/StopGaming and those who are identified to be under 18 that we are more intentional in identifying first whether they are a problematic gamer or a potential real addict and if the latter is the conclusion we should be encouraging professional supervision along with a recovery program.

I can't agree more that its important to identify whether someone is truly a problem gamer or addict. For young people especially, I wouldn't want them to jump the gun on anything. My personal story is that of being addicted from teen years on and the idea that it could have been an addiction never occurred to me. So I sort of empathize for those who could be caught in that trap. For me, thinking that maybe I was just a problem gamer, the constant failure of trying to change was extremely discouraging and a crucial blow to my self-esteem. I'd hate to see someone go through that, so when I bring up addiction, its not ever to label or assume, its merely to inform. That way maybe if someone tries and keeps failing with life advice, they won't give up - that there is another possible explanation besides ""I'm a failure"".  As we've seen, many people are unfamiliar and may misuse the term even labeling themselves an addict, so I do try to be careful.  Thanks for all you do!"

There have been a number of times that I have just stopped playing League because of the teams  and/or people in it. What I like about the strategy part, is that although the goals are the same, because there are different people playing each time with different champions there is a different take on how these things are done or accomplished.  Hahaha, man you sound a lot like me. I'm 21 btw.   ""every play you make despite your team sucking the life out of you is a HUGE accomplishment"". Yeah that is how it feels, like when your team sucks or are trolling and are still able to pull a win out. It is stressful as fuck and it 'feels' like I'm achieving this big thing by winning.   That sounds exactly like me. The first thing I sometimes do is wake up, open a stream, watch for a while, in between one of there matches I'd make breakfast, come back and watch, in between their next match, make a coffee and then by that point it's mid day and I'd repeat with lunch. Even I see how bad that is so half the time I'd tell myself I have to at least get up and/or have breakfast before I could watch these streams. This sometimes reduced the time I was watching, but not always.   trying to rank up in league is what I imagine heroin addicts feel like when they're chasing the next big high that they can never achieve. Yeah. I remember that feeling I got when I firsted started ranked and was instantly put into Silver 3 and then after a couple of matches and promos, I skipped silver 2 and jumped to Silver 1. I was like fuck yeah, I'm achieving shit. I'm good enough to jump ranks haha.    I think in one regard I'm lucky because I was just about to start a hard grind on getting ranked levels, by going to internet joints, but at the same time I've already put in between 1600-1700 matches haha.   Once again man I feel the same about chasing diamond, while others are getting jobs and married and doing things.  Deleting my account, I'm not too sure about just yet. That's a big step haha. Eventually, I would like to bring gaming back into my life at some point, just when I'm ready too and can control it. I'm going to start off with going 90 days without it and from there see what next steps I need to take. If it becomes apparent that I need to delete the account I will do so. But the fact that I can't just delete it shows how attached I am too it which is worrisome now that you've made it apparent to me.  I think you are right about deleting it, but I'll see how this 90 days goes first. If I relapse, it's evident that I need to.  Thanks for taking the time to reply to me and help me out with this.

The reason we play isn't just because games are fun but because they fulfill certain needs we have. And one of those is that it's our community. So when we go to quit we realize not only will we not be able to play but we will also be leaving our whole community behind. I recorded a video recently on this here.  The key when you move forward is to recognize (and accept) that gaming has been a part of your life and it's been a lot of fun, you had many meaningful experiences and quitting doesn't take any of that away. But now you're at a point in your life where you have new goals and ambitions, you have new priorities so you're closing one chapter (gaming) to create a new chapter (no games).  In order to do it successfully you will need to find new activities that fulfill the same needs gaming fulfilled... and research suggests a 90 day detox is necessary before your brain will rewire back to normal dopamine sensitivity levels (this is why you can find everything else boring..)

These three things I'd like to have a more serious approach to them, so it might be the case where I pick up new hobbies fill in the 'break' time so to say. This was also a role that gaming filled, which 'break' would turn into my whole day, but before I take anything else up at the moment I'll see how things go with just stopping gaming.  In one of your videos you made a good point about The Fear of Missing out. I'll just have to deal with not playing KH3 when it comes out.

I think part of it will be turning those hobbies into projects, setting goals and having more of a reason why you are doing them.  Gaming fulfills many different needs you have through one activity, so that's one reason why it can be harder to break, so combining a bunch of different activities will help, but projects is the key. For example when I started DJing I launched a monthly podcast, so now I had a reason to learn DJing and also had accountability to continue to do it more and more.  90 days is the right plan of action, I'm excited for you.

My only problem is that I am not able to figure out other things in life that might interest me more then video games.   I'm going to study in about 2 years and quite like the study (geography) but as my parents even told me: they never even see me like the subject and I actually never talked about it IRL. When I think I should begin reading books and whatnot I simply feel too alone and start gaming again.  What makes things worse is that my brother, friends, friends of friends and my whole year just plays League of Legends and those kinds of games, and I can't seem to step out of that circle because I'm not very good at making new friends or good in social life at all.   Never had a girlfriend, and feel like I've never even had a best-bestfriend as of now. I only have like 5 real friends, and don't even see them once a week (apart from school).  What I was wondering is how you were able to step into social life again, how you developped yourself into an Alphaman and a guy that anyone can hang out with no matter what. Because every time I'm gaming I feel desire to step out of the circle and be part of the life my parents and all other 'normal' people lead, and feel bad about myself. I feel like my friends are just leaving me one by one because I don't go to parties alot (never get invited) and feel like wherever I am i'm just 'that guy in the corner' who nobody knows the name off.  Though, I'm so happy for you that you hit 100 days. I myself am quite the fat guy and have been struggling to lose weight since I was born (literally) and really know how you have felt during your journey.

StopGaming,348car,camerondare,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thanks for sharing. :)  So it's quite normal to not know what might interest you other than gaming, and pretty much all of us will struggle with this to some degree. This happens for two main reasons:   Gaming has been a major part of our life so we may simply have never had other interests. Over time research shows gaming causes changes to our brain, and two of those changes are  1) numbed pleasure response which causes every day activities to no longer satisfy us and 2) hyper-reactivity to gaming which means we enjoy gaming a lot and find other activities boring in comparison.   So you take all of that combined and it's no wonder when we go to quit we struggle to find new activities we enjoy or are interested in.  Next you want to know that we game for specific reasons, they fulfill certain needs we have... so trying to replace gaming with one interest (say in your example: geography) may not fulfill all the needs gaming did in a single activity. (Again, one of the reasons why quitting can be hard... gaming fulfilled so many needs for us.)  If you need a refresher on the needs gaming fulfills check out this article.  As you've spoken of gaming fulfills a social need for you, so when you go to quit you're worried about what you'll do with all of your friends. What you want to do is two things: 1) find different ways to engage with your current gamer friends - outside of gaming and 2) take this opportunity without games to start learning how to make new friends. (More on this strategy is in this video.)  For more help on the social side check out the Art of Charm podcast. It will help a lot! But even if you struggle with your social skills right now I want you to know you can make big changes to them if you put effort in and focus on reading articles/watching videos and then implementing what you're learning.  We're all in this together so I hope you know you aren't alone. Let us know if we can help in any way!"

Do you think I should publish my progress here or know a place I can, or would I just create a mess of stories in here which is ofcourse unwanted?  As for now, i'll try watching your videos and article and website you gave me. Some guys on this subreddit also gave some good reading advise so I'll be looking up those.  A tiny problem is that Im still in high school and have had a lot of willpower to get to the next year every single year, so do I want to make this year. Problem is if I go on like this (getting distracted from schoolwork such as investigating what I could do to improve my life) for 8 more weeks I'll need to redo a year, and that is known to kill motivation. So ill probably not stop gaming untill after these weeks. I know I shouldn't, but I feel I dont have enough time to evaluate all the possibilities in life besides gaming yet. But yea, if I stop now I might get depressed.  Anyways, much love from my side and thanks for doing this. Really!"

What did it for me was a match, my team had a bunch of jerks, and I was carrying. Eventually we get overconfident and get into an unfavorable team fight @ baron, after that, it was me trying to keep the team together, and the 4 other members blaming each other and fighting. Despite my best efforts and intentions, we lost. I was on a losing streak, and this match was what made me snap, I've never gotten so mad in my entire life.  I deleted the game, told myself I would never play it again. But hey, I had done this other times and it didn't stop me, I would eventually go back to it. However, this time I knew it would be different. It had to be different. I couldn't waste more time on this game. I was so mad that I was willing to go all-in on never playing it again, and this is what I did. I wrote down all the reasons why I would never go back to LoL, and recorded a video of me, totally mad telling future me to never go back on the decision of not playing. I also told all my friends about it, gave my best friend 50$ and told him, that if he saw me online on LoL, on the following 3 months, the money was his.  After that, every time I thought of going back, I re read the reasons I quit, I rewatched the video of super ragy past me, telling me to never go back to League. I never went back.  it's been a year.  Post Script: I know it may seem like I overdid it, but I really had a problem. Like, a 12 hour a day + being angry 20/7 kind of problem. I knew I couldn't keep living like that. Also, I know that this text is huge, but I felt the need to write it. If you (and/or OP) really decide to go ahead with the decision (which I encourage), you have me to talk to. I'm still not game free, but I'm League free. PM me if you need anyone to talk to. Do this, (both you and OP) mark my name somewhere, bookmark my profile, whatever. If you guys (or anyone in the sub) ever need anyone to talk to, I'm here, and I care. PM me, tell me you're the League guy, and you will have my full attention. You guys don't know how much I would do to help you.   Best wishes, I hope to hear back from you."

He was suppose to go to coda meetings too but never did which is bad of him. He is a  huge codepent but hey... i cant change what he doesnt want to. Anyway... I least know the aa meetings helped him.

Honestly without him I would have quit games in freshman/sophomore year of highschool and never gone back. I played runescape at the time and he got me into WoW which we played for a few years before switching over to League when I got so fed up with WoW that I deleted all my shit. They (him and my other 3s partner) would always make fun of me for getting mad and deleting my accounts only to e-mail customer support to get them back. The thing is I didn't realize I was addicted all those years back until recently. Then when we switched to League I just couldn't stop playing. He's an addict too but not nearly on the scale that I am. He's still playing occasionally and has days where he'll spend 5-10 hours on league but he can get away from it sometimes. I'm out but he's still in and it's going to be hard talking to him anymore if it's about league or weed (which I also quit). He's one of my best friends but some of our only interactions have involved getting high and gaming for the entire day. We used to hang out and talk music and go out and adventure but as soon as we started WoW we did nothing but game and get high. Having someone else to hang on to while you're slowly drowning fucking sucks because it feels like you're letting them down when you quit. He kept me wrapped up in the whole thing but I finally realized that it's my choice and not his and i quit. I hope you and your buddy keep it up, I'm going to try to convince my friend to quit like I did but he's incredibly stubborn and a little self involved at times but I love him dearly and don't want to see him spending his time playing games when he's an AMAZING guitarist.

Most of us invested into this nothingless pit called gaming and got a friend or two and some wins out of it, but you have to give up twice as many ""achievements"" in a fake world as most of us.  In my opinion: I find it's important to split your new free time with hobbies that reward you immeadiately and larger projects with a delayed gratification element.  Good luck to  you."
StopGaming,347tnd,freekeypress,2,Wed Apr 29 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"We have two different forms of happiness, the transient, present sense of happiness, and the happiness of looking back at your achievements, your memories. - My dad told me this from a book he read a while back; a book published in around the 1970's? They found out through brain scans or something that you are the happiest while watching TV (remember this was before computers, and now video-games are the equivalent if not even more stimulating) But when they asked the subject what makes them the happiest they hardly ever replied: ""T.v"" So this was a bit of a dilemma to the scientists. So they split happiness into two different classes. Present happiness and long term happiness. To be truly happy in life we aim for the long term happiness like the people on this reddit are trying to do.  Although today it really is difficult. Many people from the past generation would say ""Why don't kids go outside to play? It's so sad."" or something along these lines when really in our age this is the equivalent. Why? because video-games or the successful ones ARE SOCIAL. We now have fun with friends in video games. It's pretty much the same thing but in a different dimension.   And another reason its addictive is this: Humans have a desire to learn; it's entrenched into our nature. We have a desire to progress and that's what games offer us. You never stay static in a game, you improve, you level up and that satiates your natural desire and obviously the natural desire of nearly all teenagers and children out there today. It's mainstream now.  I can sympathise with you, poopyfarts, because i'm coming out of a CSGO addiction. I'm in a pretty similar situation because I was the top player in my community. (and generally I faced the same players because i'd play community servers better fit for Chinese connection)  I was the best. I even felt I was almost good enough to be professional. I saved up for all the gaming equipment: Razer mousemats, mouse and headphones and even a gaming computer and I'd invest hours into studying the game, at school i'd talk about the game to my friends, I'd follow the competition, I was fully immersed. Even today I felt a huuuuge urge to play and to set up my PC from under my bed after I watched a few CS:GO videos because they popped up on the side bar. I was doing what most people do: trying to justify this and trying to rationalise this.   The worst thing is that this is one of the only things that I was ever really good at. I've gamed since a young age and played the CS franchise for 5+ years.  I think the best thing to do is to do something that has a stake in both fields, present happiness and long term happiness: reading perhaps or drawing.  TLDR preamble;  If you quit video-games for long enough you might have the attention span to read this whole thing which would be much appreciated buuut if you're like most me on most articles then:  TLDR; Equivalent to in the past going out to play because games are social and multifaceted. Try to do something that you will enjoy now and later."

Don't think about what you are going to after 21 days, just focus on not playing video games. You're going to have a lot of spare time and probably a lot of boredom too.

Rocksmith is just a modern way of translating tabs and making your practice time more efficient.

One of the most important secrets of life is that you don't have to stay friends with people just because you were friends with them. Our friends can change throughout life especially as our interests and ambitions change, so allow the impermanence of life to play its course, especially with your friends.  The key to making new friends is to start surrounding yourself by the type of people you want to hang out with. The way you do this is by figuring out who are the types of people you want to be friends with and then hanging out in environments where they hang out.  For instance I'm into entrepreneurship so I hang out in coffee shops throughout the day (while I work on my laptop) and because of this I also meet other people who have the ability to work on their laptop throughout the day (they are also at the cafe!)  I also go to entrepreneurial meetups and conferences.   So what are your goals and interests? How can you find similar people to that and where do they hang out? Most of all, allow yourself to lose touch with the friends in your life who aren't inspiring you forward. It's ok we all have different paths. That's really the secret.

The reason many of us are trying to quit is that video games are currently hindering our ability to do what we want with our lives. So instead of focusing on avoiding video games, focus instead on what you want to do with your life. Maybe it's getting a fun job, maybe it's going for bike rides, maybe it's learning to enjoy reading again, most likely it's a combination of things.

StopGaming,33zhth,its0K,2,Mon Apr 27 09:19:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, congrats to you too. It's motivating to see you regularly posting and succeeding in abstaining, it definitely helped me get further than my previous one month record. How are you doing, have things improved for you?  I am doing alright, I have had some but not an unmanageable amount of difficulty staying off the games recently. I'm developing more healthy habits like spending more time reading and cooking, and I'm definitely enjoying life more. Unfortunately I'm still struggling with procrastination and my academic performance has not improved much.  I did some googling about dealing with addiction and I ended up reading Breaking Addiction by Dr. Lance M. Dodes. I figured he knew what he was talking about and I identified with a lot of what he was saying about addiction, so now I'm trying to follow the methods he describes in his book.  From the introspection I’ve done so far, I think my compulsive behaviors result from an underlying sense of shame. Doing challenging academic work seems to remind me of experiences I found humiliating in the past such as poor academic performance. Then I end up coping with my frustration at a sense of shame which I feel helpless to address by switching to activities I feel I have control over, like playing games, browsing the internet, reading and relaxing.  Right now I’m trying to understand the nature of my emotional difficulties and figure out how to live with them. My current strategy for when I feel caught in an emotional trap is asking myself whether my feelings of shame and helplessness are justified by the situation I am in or if they are a manifestation of my underlying sense of shame and not reflective of the significance of the situation that triggered them. The idea is that if I can isolate my sense of shame from the conditions that prompt it, then it will not interfere with my life as much as it currently does. I have had some success with this method so far but procrastination is still a problem. Maybe in the long term I can address the sense of shame itself but I’m not sure how to go about that, Dodes didn’t make it clear in his book.  If you're still struggling with compulsive behaviors I recommend taking a look at Lance M. Dodes' website and reading his book if you're interested. I feel like I'm preaching too much, but I think his approach gave me some insight into the nature of my behavior so I want to share it. If you have any opinions about his ideas I'd appreciate if you'd share because I'm still not 100% sold on the accuracy of what he is saying and am looking for outsider perspectives."

Also it's a challenge following a schedule I set for myself without external pressure. It's frustrating but that's the way it works out for me.   That's why I'm trying a different approach. Although it seems like it should be simple for me to just do what I need to do when I need to do it, I haven't had much success trying to do that. Hopefully my current strategy will enable me to do things ahead of time as efficiently as I currently do them when under time pressure."

Many online games (hearthstone, league, any MMO really) try to get you to play every day with a ""first win of the day"" or ""daily quest"" system.  Offline games are much more honest and I would compare them to reading a book. You go at your own pace, can put it down without losing your place, and you will have earned the complete experience by the end of it.  The primary difference between offline games and books, however, is that some offline games still demand a lot of time from you. If the game you are playing pressures you to complete multiple playthroughs to get every ending, or if you feel the need to earn every achievement, or if you are playing an offline version of an online game (counter-strike vs bots, for instance) then you should probably stay away from those games.  All in all, offline-only can be a healthy (albeit expensive) way to enjoy gaming without the everyday compulsion. If you choose this path, make sure you take breaks often, every hour or so, to ensure that you don't accidentally spend too much time on the game."
StopGaming,33wvwa,fetchystick,5,Sun Apr 26 12:43:26 2015 UTC,"Well, my vice comes primarily in offline games, so it does not apply to me."
StopGaming,33wvwa,LordTengil,3,Sun Apr 26 20:49:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not really the best example because my main problem wasn't playing videogames non-stop (my real addiction was to constantly watch/listen/read coverage of videogames and its industry), but due to the sheer amount of games I had (huge backlog of offline games), and some of them pretty big on the longevity side (gameplay hours (RPG mostly)), and also add not playing any online game, I became somewhat addicted, more in the sense of 'I have to finish all of these games because I paid for them' than 'I gotta play all of these games because they are the best'. So maybe people like me played a lot of games because of different reasons than the most common ones which is to play them repetitively and nonstop because of it being an habit and for reasons of pure enjoyment.  That doesn't necessarily mean that offline games don't have some of the same intrinsics that online games do. That's why some people value longevity and replay on offline games, because they want to get more 'bang for buck'.   So I think that if you were addicted to online games and you wanted to play offline games because they don't have the same design and characteristics of an online game... that is not entirely true. You would probably get attached too much in the same way you got ""compelled"" to play your online game of choice, over and over.  There are some games that are short and don't convey the same way the games I mentioned before, do (p.e., indie games). But they are the minority and a lot of videogames nowadays are designed to get you to play it for long stretch of hours. There are even systems to get you to play a game for even a longer period of time (as you mentioned, achievements).  My advice is to stay away of them completely if you think you have an addictive personality towards videogames in general."

My advice is: Give gaming up completely for a certain amount of time, let's say 3+ months at least - the more the better. And make sure to work on your underlying issues in life that kept you sitting in front of a computer screen. After that time is up AND you have made enough progress at solving your issues so that gaming won't jeopardize your life any more, then give it a try (with all those rules still in effect, obviously).  But even then, take precautions, like telling someone you trust about going back and preparing ""safety protocols"" in case it doesn't work out.  A note at the end: change rule number 3 to ""No thinking, strategizing, watching videos about gaming outside of my actual gaming time. And the gaming time is restricted to X hours on sundays."""

If it doesn't and you end up having to stop all gaming, you'll be more convinced that that's what's necessary. My main caution: if you have a pattern of trying different methods of moderating and failing every time, then I'd be concerned that you're setting yourself up for failure again (or trying to justify why it's worth continuing to play when the evidence shows it's not healthy for you). I could never have succeeded at what you described; I'd have spent all the time I wasn't playing obsessing about playing even if I didn't want to. But then again, I only have the perspective of an addict. My other caution is that if you have any withdrawal symptoms from stopping on days other than Sundays, then you're setting yourself up to experience those every week. If so, it may be better to take time off and then reintroduce gaming on Sundays and see what happens."

StopGaming,33owqt,zbud,2,Sat Apr 25 09:25:34 2015 UTC,"Regarding my feelings this far in abstaining from gaming: it is pretty easy to avoid gaming; although procrastination is still present.  The first three months was rough and there was a lot of internet replacement in place of the gaming; plus a series of progressive belt tightening for that.  Then there was unbridled obsession/compulsion with finding the perfect headphones during winter break. It was in hopes of making work time at home and studio a bit more pleasant and less distracting. Regardless, it got way out of hand.  Now, to an extent I don't prioritize all that well and pressing to-do's get substituted for to-do's of less importance.  My To Do list is however getting pretty small and I classify my to-dos based on a system of priority. I've gone through a 100 pg notebook of to do list items over the past 7 months which probably means about 500 tasks of varying magnitude. I'd say almost the lion share have been done in the past 2 months.  I wouldn't say things are perfect but they're getting better. Every progressive month I can usually say, ""this is the most disciplined I've ever been"" truthfully (so basically I could say the phrase and mean it in Nov, Feb, Now ... n (okay Jan was pretty bad)).  I might be more impressed with myself for getting my sleep schedule into an area of normality and social acceptability. My sleep schedule has been ludicrously variable and fucked up for the past 10 years (minus a few good bouts here and there). Next is to get my back pain in check (which I assume will improve my sleep quality).  Me in mid August compared to me now, is night and day. Despite the growing pains mentioned throughout this comment; reflecting on the disparity between the past and now is actually a source of great pride. Cheers, and keep the trust in your new life decision (if anything for the sake of an experiment in pursuit of happiness)."
StopGaming,33owqt,camerondare,2,Fri Apr 24 15:26:45 2015 UTC,I believe that my in ability to prioritize and pursue goals on any scale is a result of gaming for years in which anything outside the game was a race to finish an obligation to prevent it from  keeping me away too long.  I think it's fair to cut yourself some slack with aimless activity because to an extent we haven't exercised a proactive lifestyle outside of games often enough.  It's like trying to get into fitness without spending the time to get used to cleaning some serious weights.

I'm not going to attempt to address everything in your post and similarly I tried to take it step by step for my own issues, when I initially quit back in something like the 2nd or 3rd week of fall semester. Perhaps a similar strategy/mindset would work for you.   You're attempting to make some serious life changes at a stressful time; bluntly. I think its a bit naive to expect that I can pick up the pieces or create new life habits in days; similarly its probably naive for you to think you can make everything perfect in the matter of days. To use a metaphor, we've all carved ruts of behavior with time. Now we gotta make a new rut but its very easy for our wheels to fall into the old path.  Personally, I'm still creating my new mode of responses to life challenges. I'm getting progressively more disciplined, resistant and resilient to challenges. It has been a long struggle but it requires picking myself up over and over and continuing to learn and build my menta health foundation. It hasn't been a particularly sexy path but I trust this path is much better than drowning my troubles in compulsive distractions.  Good luck man. Meditation is a good place to start IMO.

I know several people with alcohol or drug addictions who say that they find gaming addiction to be even worse to get (and stay) out of than their substance habit, so it's not a shock to me that you're finding it hard.  Heck, I relapsed quite regularly for months after starting to get serious about quitting, and that was with even more support than a forum to post on.  Arguably the only thing I did right when I was quitting was refusing to give up when I relapsed.  I very nearly gave up completely after 8 months when I relapsed for the nth time, but the memory of how unbearable life became when I was gaming was enough to get me to try one more time.  A little less than 500 days later, things are very different.  I still participate in a 12-Step recovery program from gaming addiction (you can find us here), and don't anticipate that ever changing, but I'm no longer owned by that awful obsession.  I had times when I would walk into my apartment and realize ""I could game right now"" (not WANT to, merely COULD), and this really odd sensation would start in the front of my head and I'd become a passenger in my own body watching myself walk over to the computer so I could game.  I'd try to stop myself, but I doubt anybody on the outside would have been able to notice that I even tried.  I hadn't known that that level of obsession or compulsion existed, but now I do.  Once I experienced it, I didn't know if it was possible for it to go away, but now I do.  I hadn't known that I could encounter a problem so severe that my best ideas would only provide me ways to make things worse, but now I do.  Once I started to figure this out, I didn't know if it was possible to get out of a disease that could hijack my brain that way, but now I do.  In the end, it's been working a 12-Step program and spending time with the fellowship that comes with it that has been saving my life from gaming, one day at a time.  Not everybody needs this kind of program, but to be honest you sound a lot like me.  The frustration (I can't even quit a *@%! GAME), the confusion (why can't I just STOP), the sense of being trapped...I get it.  So that's why I'm posting, because what worked (and is still working) for me might work for you.

If it was just autopilot I'd ""snap out of it"" at some point in the future and not quite be sure how I got there.  For example, I can't tell you how many times I started gaming after having logged on to ""check email"", and found my fingers going to my games without any conscious effort or thought on my own part.  With my zombie-brain episodes, my computer was on hibernate in the corner, and I was literally compelled to open it up, turn it on, and start gaming.  I was mentally screaming at myself to stop the entire time I was logging on and booting up the game (I knew I'd be gone in it for hours), but literally didn't have the capacity to stop myself.  I learned later that when addiction has progressed far enough, it's perfectly capable of bypassing the conscious part of the brain (which is also responsible for making moral choices) and just taking over for a while.  I'm pretty sure that's what was going on with me, and I can tell you it wasn't any fun.  Haven't had a zombie-brain episode in quite some time, thankfully. :)  And for what it's worth, I've had many times where I felt so much shame and guilt about having gamed my brains out on the previous day that I started gaming again just to cope.

Way to go! 90 days is a great benchmark to go for and research shows that's how long it will take for your brain to rewire back to normal sensitivity levels.  I definitely relate to you about having less stuff. Currently I only own a suitcase and a backpack for my laptop. It's pretty awesome to be able to move around easily. (I travel that's why I only have a few things.)  If you need ideas for new activities check out this thread.  Have a great day one and let us know if you need any help. :)

On this list of withdrawal symptoms at http://cgaa.info/withdrawal-symptoms/ you'll find some familiar items near the top.  These last different lengths of time for different people.  Some of us are more damaged than others; some are more quick to recover.  It can take a few weeks, or a few months, or even longer.  What I've seen is that even though withdrawals can last a long time, they do lessen during that time.  The most important thing is to not go back to square one by gaming again.  My #1 goal is to not start that first game between now and the end of the day.  Without gaming, everything important in life becomes possible.  With gaming, my life gradually but steadily turns to shit."

Just keep focused one day at a time and be mindful that although you're experiencing different emotional swings, just as they come they will go.

You are taking refuge through gaming thinking that after school you will be able to do other stuff. Most people think like that throughout their life ""I will be happy when I get a job"", ""I can only start a business after finishing school"". But they never are happy or do what they wanted. If you want/hope to do a certain thing in the future just do it NOW.   You are blocking your personal development with that mindset and with gaming.

StopGaming,33cqkw,Rodranquil,3,Tue Apr 21 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"Hi Geldenn,  I was in a similar situation as you growing up. I lived in a small town and I did not really mesh with anyone in my age group, mainly because I disagreed with drug/alcohol use. I was not bullied, but I felt like I couldn't connect with my peers the way I wanted to. My parents were also emotionally abusive, so I naturally withdrew to video games as an escape from my life through those years where I had little control.  I knew I was using video games as a coping mechanism, but I saw it as being a lot more positive then what my peers were doing. On top of that, I was able to make friends online which helped me not feel as lonely during that time of my life.  I am glad I used video games to get me through that time of my life, because I feel I would have been a lot worse off without them. However there comes a point where you can develop control over your life, and continuing to play video games as an escape will make it harder for you to realize when that time comes. Now that I am older, and I do have more choices and freedom towards how to live my life, I am trying to change my relationship with games. I realize that the way I played video games in the past would only hinder me in the future."

And I also understand why you don't see how you're going to stop and what you'll be doing afterwards.  From what you told us, you've never really experienced life, since this is all you've ever been doing. And I'm not judging you for that. Yet, you should be aware of it, because that's fundamental.   Even though you may have never experienced it, and thus don't have the urge to seek it out, the world is a beautiful place. Living a real life is so much more intense than the virtual one! There's more joy and there's more sadness. You'll experience awesome things beyond anything you've ever known and even though it'll be difficult and sometimes painful to get there, it will be worth it. That is living.  Gaming is but a shadow of life. You feel joy, yet you feel no pain. You're made to think you've conquered the world in Civ5 or saved America in COD, but all you did was press buttons.  I suggest you just stop using your computer for 2 months or so. Not only gaming, but also generally spending time online. The first week will be though, and you'll be bored like never before. And that's great! Because it will drive you to do stuff! What that is I can't tell you, because it'll be you who finds it. But I'm sure that you'll eventually find something. Something worth living for."

To that thing where you said I didnt experience life , I already know that real life is more intense than the virtual one, only problem is that I have no one to experience it with as I said above.  Another thing that you said about saving america etc. I play only multiplayer pvp games like league of legends or cs:go so it's only trying to get higher rank, not conquering america.

I have a more round picture now though.  About KingNoah's comment:  There definitely is some truth to what he said. You saying ""I can quit whenever I want. I just don't want to"" is something I did once too. Now I want to quit, but I can't. At least not by pure willpower. A big problem with addiction is in fact that it's usually stronger than your willpower alone. You've gotta find ways around, to get rid of an addiction.   About not having anyone to share your life with, as this seems to be very important to you:  I've was very lucky when it came to meeting the right people in my life. I'm a pianist and due to seemingly random situations (one could almost call it destiny) I've met people, whose importance to me as a musician is immense.   I'm still struggling though, because half of my friends are gamers. And if I spend time with them, they see me as a gamer. And their perception of me influences how I act in return. Making me act like a gamer.   It's a hard step, but I feel like I have to eliminate or at least spend less time with my gamer friends, to instead be around musicians who see me as a musician.  Music is just my case, I don't know what it is you're seeking, but I think you get the idea. Be around people who are going in the same direction as you are."

It strikes me that you know it's a problem and are going through the throes of the ""if I give this up, what am I?"" crisis, which is perfectly reasonable.

I've been a bread baker for about 15 years. I've picked up mead brewing and cranked up the heat on my woodworking and metalwork hobbies (each of which I'd started a year or two ago.)  I take a laptop to Barnes & Noble a few days a week after work, get a redbull, and write no less than 2000 words before heading to the gym (to do a half hour of cardio.  I'll work up to lifting.)  At the end of the day I plop down in front of the computer, faff about on twitter, reddit, and watch a couple/few youtube videos.  Then I'm done.    Will I hold on to all of these wacky hobbies and pursuits?  Certainly not.  I'll settle in to something I like more than the others, and let them drift off.  I think brewing is going to be the first casualty.  It's fun, but mead takes a year.  I'm not that patient.  I just don't have the time or energy for gaming any more.

I have stopped gaming for over 2 weeks now, and before I had quit, gaming was my only hobby. I made room for other activities, like art or reading but very rarely. I had no direction in life when I found this forum. After hours of meditating on it and realising that If I continue this way I might stay trapped forever I gave it up cold turkey. I have not thought about gaming for a week, which I am proud of mostly because of the fact my husband is a big gamer himself and is therefore hard to escape.   I was reading the last chapter of ""The Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins when it dawned on me what I wanted to do with my life. I have always wanted to help people, but I don't have the money to be a doctor so I plan on running my own organization that helps children. I am not sure if I would of been able to think about this without reading and expanding my mind.  Now I'm looking forward to learning the piano, violin and play chess competitively. I have a very classic soul that hasn't been properly nourished because of gaming. I have always wanted to do these things, but I felt I was only good at gaming and would be frustrated when I picked them up originally because I was so bad at it.   There is a forum that has this link, but I'll put it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wngVZR8ISBU  It is called ""What if gaming is the only thing you're good at"". He gives really good advice on what positive things we've learned from gaming that can be transferred to any other skill.  I too was drawn to RPGs and was never an online gamer for the same reasons you have said. Reading can also give you this kind of passion, but it will be hard at first. Gaming is interactive where reading is not, but reading will help you train your mind to be imaginative and thus you will be able to create your own stories and adventures you can also share in reading.   When you're thinking about what you will miss if you quit gaming, I have been told to think about the things you have missed because of gaming.   If you truly feel like you are addicted, it is best to quit it entirely. However, this is something you will have to decide for yourself. Quitting any addiction is scary, you may feel a lot of negative emotions but we are all here for you. I feel that you haven't truly ""quit"" gaming because you are still active in the community. Try to distance yourself from the community for a while and see how you feel.  I hope that I have helped, and good luck."

To fight the addiction I did not quit cold turkey but instead somehow managed to muddle through, enfore some moderation and right now my gaming habits are - what I'd call - healthy. There are still a lot of issues but that's beside the point.  For most people though (Hey, maybe even for me) it's best quit video games completely for at least a few months. It'll force you to find satisfaction in other areas of life and ""learn to live"" again.  So why didn't I do it? In my opinion, there's nothing bad about gaming per se and following the industry and the community is just like following sports, literature or any other form of entertainment. I also didn't want to lose this beloved hobby of mine. That's why I am still playing MMOs and other games even though, through my constant efforts to rid myself of the addiction part, I actually have to force myself to play for a prolonged time. I just don't see the addictive part any longer, it doesn't get me hooked (which is a good thing). So in the end I go on to somewhat enjoy this hobby.  It is imperative that I point out that I have no knowledge of what my life would look like had I quit cold turkey!

StopGaming,33axbd,akaelripley,3,Tue Apr 21 01:12:19 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Thanks for commenting. When I read your post it seems to me that you want to quit... but you're just not sure of a few things:   What else you'll do with your time. What to use as an outlet in times of need.   If you answer those two questions I bet it will become more clear. The thing is, it's easy to focus on whether you should go cold turkey or not when really the question is more about whether you want to quit or not. To me that answer seems like a resounding yes. Cold turkey is just a function of your genuine desire to quit.  Gaming has been a big part of your life and that's ok. It's normal to feel a bit weary of moving on, but that can also be very exciting! I know for me when I quit gaming meant a lot to me at the time but looking back it was just a way for me to avoid going after what I really wanted in life.  So I would encourage you to focus on coming up with some new goals and things you want to work towards and recognize that gaming has been a great part of your life and that's ok, but you're also allowed to move on to something else. Gaming was a chapter in your life that was a lot of fun and meant something to you, and now you're closing that chapter and moving on to a new one... without gaming but with other exciting things.  At least that's what worked for me. One day at a time.  Anyways, hope that helps. I recorded a video on this question recently. Check it out if you want: Should You Quit Gaming Cold Turkey?"
StopGaming,33axbd,camerondare,2,Tue Apr 21 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! I do because I can see what benefit it has(n't) had on me, but I still enjoy it so it will be tough to give up, especially with my new gaming behemoth forged in the pits of Mount Doom.  I see the reasoning behind it though, although I think there's one game I could still allow because it's not really a game as such - Rocksmith. I had replaced most of my normal gaming time with that recently, and was learning a decent amount of guitar skills with it, but when a game comes along that I can really sink my teeth into (Far Cry 4, GTA V) and bask in the glow of its glorious graphics, I tend to just dive in head first and not bother coming up for air.  Have you tried going back to gaming, as a time-restricted hobby, i.e. an hour a day etc? Or do you think you would just fall into addiction again?  Your video was great, and looking through your others the titles are all questions that I've been asking myself, I will watch them all for a bit of perspective, cheers!"
StopGaming,33axbd,camerondare,3,Tue Apr 21 06:18:21 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you enjoyed it!   This reply got a bit long so I'll mark it in two sections. My experience and thoughts on going back to moderation.   My experience:  I haven't really gone back to gaming being a time-restricted hobby. I definitely could at this point but for me it really was more about just allowing gaming to go and embracing the impermanence of life. Although I really enjoyed gaming and it was a magical part of my life, nowadays when I have free time I'm more drawn to other passions I have - DJing, reading, hanging out with friends.  And if I'm being honest, one of the major shifts I've had since I quit gaming is a strong focus on creating the type of life I want. So when I was gaming I had a few responsibilities in my life, let's say for example I had to work 9-5. So I would spend the whole day working so I could get home and game all night. And then I would repeat this every day.  So gaming for me was yes a way to enjoy life but it was also a way to kill time until I had to go back to work the next day.  When I quit I started thinking about what I really wanted my life to look like, and having freedom and flexibility was at the top of that... so I started learning how to start my own business. Now six years later I'm at a point where I travel full-time working on my laptop. I spent the ""winter"" in LA and now I'm heading to Bali in two weeks.  What I guess I want to share is that my concept of ""time"" is different now, because it's not work time vs. free time. Every minute of my day counts and I'm conscious of how I spend it to be fulfilled in my life. Whether that means where I'm located (travel), who I'm spending my time with (you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with) or how I'm spending that time - when I get to Bali in two weeks I won't have my DJ gear, but I'll spend more time doing yoga, hiking and surfing when I'm not ""working"" because those are activities the local environment offers.  Moderation:  Now none of this takes away from a love you can have for gaming, building comps or the type of experience you get from gaming. They can absolutely be an authentic part of what you enjoy in life.  I have friends who are married with kids who still play games because it's a passion they have. But the relationship between themselves and gaming is healthy and they hold themselves accountable in that way. (Locke Vincent is one of those friends, we recorded a podcast about it here.)  But when it comes to moderation I think this is what's important:  Go 90 days without games before considering otherwise. 90 days is what research shows you need for your brain chemistry to rewire back to normal dopamine sensitivity levels. I'll go more into this in the future but what's important is that you go 90 days without games. That will allow you the full amount of time you need to see how your body and mind respond, and then you can make the decision about whether you want to reintroduce gaming or not.  And if you are unable to go 90 days without games then you absolutely should not be playing them.  Lastly, when it comes to the question of if gaming is an addiction or not or whether you have an addiction to gaming or not, research is still up in the air about this. But what is shown is that 90 days is a good milestone to get to and one piece of addiction criteria is that the substance (in this case, gaming) is having a negative impact on your life.  Some people will be able to game in moderation and be fine, others will not, just as some are able to drink in moderation and others are not. It's relative to you so you need to be mindful of how this all works with yourself and use the 90 day experience as a way to learn more about how your relationship with gaming is. I share more about this in Is it ok to play games in moderation?  Anyways, hope that helps. Have a great day! Special shoutout to /u/zbud, looks like I have my mojo back. ;)"

I'm not sure about the whole idea of ""you can't force your mind to be quiet""; I'd say that's more or less what I do when I meditate.

Certainly there are parts of life that are still difficult: I have trouble with too much computer use, and sleeping seems to be elusive to me at times.

There are unique experiences in every facet of life, and while I still hold games in high regard as a story telling medium, that isnt the problem.

I had a dream where I was playing a next gen Lost Planet on my Xbox One (it was awesome obviously cuz the game's not even out) and the kid playing with me was my friend that is pursuing StopGaming. After that I had 2-3 dreams with me playing on my PS Vita. I still had a dream about playing it even after I sold it. Then I remembered when I woke up I don't even own a vita lol. I've had the same thing happen to me because of NoFap. I've had multiple dreams with fapping and looking at porn and just scrolling. It wasn't till I awoke that I realized it was a dream; I was so scared. I like to indulge the philosopher in me so my theory to some not all dreams just the ones which seem real based off your situation in life are really alternate realities. Hey, just a little theory I have and if you don't like it. That's okay because it's a theory. The dream with me playing battlefield 4 via remote play on my PS Vita could have been very possible if I never found r/StopGaming. I've had certain ones where my friend bought a new device and due to him about to get in trouble to hide it, he gave me the device. So I awoke in my dream with me having the device under my pillow and starting my day off using it. After getting ready I went to my old martial arts school but in this reality. I still went there and I was amazed because I hadn't been there in about 5 years so it was nice to see it again.  Was taking to my two friends that I met from the martial arts school and I saw this other kid we used to be friends with. So it was nice to let the dream play out. I can't fully lucidly dream on control at any given moment but I usually try to be aware in my dreams and at least look around everywhere and enjoy it. Also, I don't always try to take over the dream because I like enjoying the dream as if it were a movie. I've took control of a dream once and it was hard but absolutely astonishing. I was able to think of anything and have it appear in front of me. So an example, a girl I like but have never met. So I talked to her and then my friends all gathered at a picnic table at the park. It started with me in a house and I opened the door and saw the girl. Anyway, if you want to have a lot of dreams then try sleeping as close to 10pm as possible. I have a dream journal and due to bad sleep patterns because of school and stress, haven't had a lot of dreams. But, I usually have about 4-5 and one of them is a dream within a dream. I really looked forward to and enjoyed these. Sorry for the long post on dreams. I hope you could find some meaning to this. So it wasn't a waste of your time."

There's a lot of complexity when you quit gaming and one of the things that can happen is you realize at first you had such a high motivation to not play but now that you're doing better you are losing out on that same sense of purpose and urgency so it seems like the way you were approaching it before was a bit silly. I've experienced this a lot in breakups, where at first I thought it was such a big deal but over time I looked back and laughed at myself. But it doesn't mean you need to game or that you can game in moderation, it just means you're shifting in the intensity of gaming and/or not gaming.  Focus on new goals and what you're doing with your time without gaming. That's the most important part. For me now I don't think about not gaming because I spend my time focused on new goals and dreams I'm working towards. :)"

You might lose weight, too, if you normally snack while gaming.  Benefits are also gained by what you choose to fill the gaming void with. If instead of gaming for hours a day, you start working out and learn to cook, your health will be a huge benefit to stopping, for example.  Also, I've found when I don't game, I don't get that feeling at the end of the night. You probably know that feeling as a gamer. It's when you slide into bed, and all you can think about is ""I've wasted my entire day. What the fuck is wrong with me? I have dreams and goals and I'm no closer to them today than I am a month ago because of video games. That's it! I'm going to stop gaming tomorrow! I mean it! Oh, who am I kidding?

By distancing yourself from video games for a while you'll learn to enjoy other activities again. Real life doesn't offer the tangible, immediate and easily accessible rewards that video games have to offer. After a while your brain will learn to enjoy these things again. What I mean by that is that right now, everything apart from games might seem super boring, but that's just because you're still used to e.g. the exhilarating feeling of a new legendary in D3, a precursor drop in GW2 or a super close win that you enabled with a penta in LoL. Compared to that, preparing a delicious meal or running for 45 minutes seems completely pointless.  So give real life a chance and then maybe learn to enjoy it too.   These are more or less the most important benefits.

Three hours later I might emerge, brain in a fog, look at a clock and wonder what just happened (even though I knew that this happened pretty much every time I started gaming). The fog meant that I wasn't thinking clearly and had a hard time doing the things I set out to do in the first place. So I'd spend a little longer trying to get them done and decide that if I wasn't going to be productive anyways, then I might as well go back to the game. I had no motivation and didn't even really care about having motivation.  Add to that a significant amount of sleep deprivation, not eating well, running late to everything, not getting stuff done I was supposed to be doing and lying about why I wasn't done with it, and generally being completely stalled in my life and stuck in a depression I couldn't get out of. I've lost a lot of career opportunities, let go of friendships that mattered to me, and started having back pain and sciatica.

Giving in to gaming 24/7 just because you don't have other responsibilities might not be the best advice. After all, you're allowing your brain to get used to the constant feeling of progression and rewards. That's something you won't find that easily in real life, so once it's time to quit gaming you'll be facing a reality that - when compared to gaming - seems like such a drag. I think it's totally okay to love video games and play them vigorously but never lose the grip on reality so that you can exist without video games' reward and progression systems too.   What I would agree on is the ""Don't force yourself off it"" part, at least to a certain degree. As with most forms of obsession/addiction/compulsion it's important to break the cycle at least once. That's only possible if you stop cold turkey for a while. The part I agree with (at least if you allow me this very free interpretation based on ""a set of priorities"") is that you should always look for meaning and satisfaction elsewhere in life - that's the part I am struggling with.   What's the point in quitting games when there's nothing else for you to do? Always try to find other priorities and activities that fullfill your needs. If you can't do that, then quitting video games will always feel negative because all you're going to be seeing is that you've abandoned something wonderful and replaced it with a boring job, paying taxes etc."

At one point I stopped playing GW2 (""that game"" for me) for three weeks just to distance myself a bit and break the vicious cycle. After those three weeks I couldn't even force myself to play again (!). I did eventually miss my online friends a bit and I occasionally log on to play with them but those occasions are rare because what the 3 week break taught me was that - after 3k hours - the game was just boring. I didn't play out of fun but out of compulsion.   It's a great first step although it's still a long way from finding something else. Just like you, I'll just roll with it and see where life takes me while trying to lead a more or less balanced life that doesn't revolve (or rely) on a single activity too much."
StopGaming,330t0b,needmorepaper,6,Sat Apr 18 11:56:16 2015 UTC,"You're looking at this the wrong way. The important question isn't ""Is X considering 'gaming'?"" The important question is ""If I do X, will I have fun doing X in moderation, or will X leech away my free time, happiness, and vitality?""  Don't ban yourself from chess because ""it's gaming"". Ban yourself from chess because it makes you obsessive, takes up your time, and doesn't actually make you happy. Or maybe you can play chess in moderation, in that case it would be foolish to cut yourself off from a joy that you can easily control."

It's fine to play, I think the point of this subreddit is to get away from the addiction and while moderacy is key, it is much easier to coldturkey rather than to gradually slow it down. So you might want to quit gaming first, and then try to pick up chess. The great thing about chess is that you're not always up for playing a game (because they can be long winded/stressful) so I'd say go ahead and pick it up after you've stopped gaming."

StopGaming,330t0b,poopyfarts,2,Mon Apr 20 01:01:29 2015 UTC,"Board gaming is vastly preferable to video gaming; they have the best aspects of video games, but they clearly end instead of making you want 'one more turn'. Gaming is good in moderation (around 15-30 minutes a day is all you need for the positive psychological and cognitive benefits), but detrimental if you play like 40+ hours a week (it causes stress and anxiety). Board games helped me stop having the false dilemma that either I quit gaming cold turkey and give up the positive benefits or I should play video games and suffer the consequences. I recommend board gaming instead of going cold turkey, at least for the time you transition away from gaming compulsion.  If you have someone to play board games with that would be great. You should check out board space if you like abstract (chess-like) board games. I recommend meditation and mindfulness to help find other ways to be relaxed."
StopGaming,330t0b,zbud,2,Sat Apr 18 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting stance; I'm generally of the variety to think that one should categorize what game types have lead to chronic lack of self control (for me: all online multiplayer games, strategy games, RPGs etc.) and avoid those. However, I say go ahead for the rest; just be very mindful of ""can I control myself with this game"" or restated""am I kidding myself"".   The ""authorities"" I've come in contact with suggest the 90 day brain rewire first. I think that was meant to include all electronic gaming. For that reason, I'd avoid all electronic gaming even if it's board format in digital representation. The gamble just isn't worth it for me anymore; perhaps you guys got time to experiment though.  I'm tentative about chess. I'd definitely avoid online/computer format. If you have the option of experimenting I say give it a try just be mindful and if you lose control; then ""tighten your belt"".  I appreciate a ""new"" perspective (especially with a source).

It's a lot easier to have things planned to do on the weekend by Tuesday than it is to try and figure them out once you are bored on a Friday night.  So by Tuesday each week I try and have fun things planned for the weekend and this helps me look forward to the weekend instead of dreading it because I'll spend the whole weekend resisting games.  Try meetup.com, it's a great place to find events and things to do. :)  Also, congrats on 8 weeks without games, that's a huge accomplishment so make sure you feel proud of yourself for it!"

I've always found it interesting because for some reason - I'm not sure why - as gamers we don't build the parallel between being really good at gaming and our ability to actually get good at anything else we want.  So in today's video I share the 7 strategies I used to get really good at gaming (that I bet you used too..) that you can now use on any of the new hobbies or activities you've chosen to get good at them too.  If you need ideas for new activities, check out either this thread or if you want a more organized hobby guide I have one here.  Let's have a great rest of the week!  P.S.

It was much less of a conscious choice and instead a lifestyle developed from an early age.  So now it's about checking in and recognizing the type of life you do want to create for yourself.

StopGaming,32oyab,rabbitz23,2,Wed Apr 15 16:47:24 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it the more I think there is no ""miracle cure"" in most cases. I read a bit of psychiatrist Lance M. Dode's theory of how addiction works. He argues that the motivation behind addictive behaviors is an attempt to reverse a sense of frustration when things don't go our way. So his strategy for dealing with addiction is learning behaviors that help us feel a sense of control in our lives without resorting to the addictive one, so we can cope whenever we feel frustrated.  It seems like the reason addicts are not able to moderate their behavior is that they regularly feel deeply frustrated at a sense of helplessness in their life. This is why addicts, after successfully quitting one addiction, often end up substituting another one in its place. Whereas someone else would just start their homework whenever they needed to in order to get a good grade on it, I try to start it early and then become frustrated when I encounter a difficulty in the problem-solving process. I then give up on the homework and engage in some instantly gratifying behavior that reverses the sense of frustration until panic mode kicks in due to time constraints.  The closest thing to a ""miracle cure"" for addiction for many people seems to be developing healthy methods for dealing with frustration whenever it crops up and gradually learning to live with it."

When you're feeling this way there's a 3-step process you want to use to break out of the funk.  The reason is because what you resist, persists. So when you're resisting the ""pain"" it will only prolong... whereas when you accept it and move forward anyways it will subside.  So the 3 steps you want to go through are this:   Acknowledge Accept Action   Acknowledge: what is happening. You are feeling nostalgic and having a craving. It's something with your emotions, a chemical imbalance in your body most likely.  Accept: Ok, so you're feeling nostalgic and having a craving. Ok, I guess you're going to feel nostalgic and have a craving. Oh well.  Action: Now take a positive action towards the emotion you want to experience. Don't want to feel down and lethargic? Get moving around. Do some jumping jacks, jump up and down, now get out of the house and bring a book to read. Go for a walk, with your phone and create a challenge of taking a cool picture.  You can go through these 3 steps any time you need to. For more on this check out my video on how to deal with cravings."

Physically speaking there's nothing wrong with masturbation, in fact it's advisable to do it at least once a week, but orgasms have an interesting effect in the brain, it makes you feel good and accomplished, and when you're trying to get out of a situation and it requires a lot of work and dedication, feeling accomplished is not something you want, orgasms drain energy and motivation like a thirsty camel at an oasis. If you're having a hard time quitting something like gaming, then it might get easier if you stop fapping for a while, you'll feel less burnt out.  It also works for people who are trying to find partners, if you don't fap you feel (much) hornier, feeling horny lowers your standards and it makes it more likely for you to take action."

It's also what makes the withdrawals and quitting so difficult for some people because at first, it can be difficult to find that same sensation in the real world.  I try to tell people that expecting that sensation right off the bat is unrealistic and will lead to relapse. When I quit gaming, I struggled to find any meaning in my life at all. It takes time!  The only way I was able to get through the early phase of withdrawal and quitting gaming was with a fellowship of other addicts. It's hard to put into words just how helpful it is to share with others and hear their shares too, in real time. Meetings are all I focused on or cared about for the first month.   Eventually though...I did start to find satisfaction and accomplishment in other areas in my life. You said you want to learn to produce EDM? That's precisely one of my hobbies that I have finally grown to enjoy...I couldn't find pleasure in many things when I was gaming or shortly after quitting. It did finally come though.

It is incredibly compelling, but I don't think fun is the right word. I'll share my history of league of legends, and it's not pleasant.  I stopped playing league after I pissed off my girlfriend with my attitude when she tried to play with me. I couldn't comprehend how she could possibly be so bad, struggle so much with to elementary concepts, as she is a competent gamer. I didn't like the person the game made of me, and I wasn't having fun, so I stopped.  I hated league after the day of my wedding reception. I was visiting with family friends who I had obligation to meet with and my personal friends were all off in another area... and half of them just dominated the conversation talking about league. The other half sat, tried to steer the conversation away, failed, got bored, and left after about an hour. When they left, the league players did too. I got to spend five, maybe ten minutes visiting with my friends, some of whom I hadn't seen in a long time, at my wedding reception, because the fools couldn't stop talking about this fucking game. My wedding reception was ruined because this stupid fucking game where they change shit all the time so nobody ever understands the game, pretty much every single person who plays thinks they're better than they are, everybody is frustrated two thirds of the time, and the act of playing without sense of victory is hollow. This stupid bubbling cauldron of negativity and obsession. I was pretty pissed. I stopped occasionally regretting that I hadn't played, hadn't learned the game, and it was pretty much out of my life.  Fast forward two years. A month or so ago, a friend of mine who hadn't had a computer for a year came by and installed it on my machine to play a game. I considered playing League again, maybe it wasn't so bad. He played two games shouting flavor commentary at nobody as he played as if he was streaming, but the pointless kind of commentary where almost all of it is either gloating, yelling out ""bullshit!"", or calling computer champions whores. That's when I decided I would never touch it again.  League of legends is compelling. It is not fun."

They satisfy that same craving that video games provide as you've said, and because the video game version that Magic provides, will inevitably pull you back into gaming or addiction. MTG is incredibly addicting and on another note can cost you a lot of money. As fun as it may seem, the more you delve into it, the harder it is to get out because of the social circle you form the people you will meet along the way support this type of behavior. A typical trend that keeps you hooked is the new ""top deck"" or the ""tier 0"" deck that changes the meta. New strategies are constantly forming because of shifts in gameplay, changes to banned cards, successful decks that are anti-meta, the list goes on and on. I highly suggest that you try your best to avoid it because even moderation can lead to addiction with this game especially when it's easy to access. FYI, some of the best decks can set you back hundreds of dollars and buying ""singles"" will cost you a lot. There is a sort of satisfaction in opening packs and you'll see people doing that online which can also cost you a lot of money. Going into the whole trading of these cards is also another attractive feature so keep track of how much you spend on cards as well."
StopGaming,32ev3c,Joecasta,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:31:49 2015 UTC,"That is precisely why I'm wary about it.  I have seen how ridiculous it gets, especially on the cost front.  And yet, I resolved that I am not even going to think that the video game version exists and only play in person, because I do need a social outlet of some sort (and if I can redirect the urge to play games into a social experience like this, my thinking is it could help).  Could just be the part of my mind trying to justify the behavior though, I don't know.  As for the cost aspect, that is something else I have had at the back of my mind. You're right: it can get expensive.  I was looking up different decks online out of curiosity and was just shocked at the total cost of some of them.  That said, I never spend beyond what I can afford on a monthly basis (and indeed, my folks have mentioned I might be a little too tight at times), and so I'm not as concerned with being able to hold myself back.  Even in Hearthstone, the game that I was most addicted to and what makes me think Magic might be a good diversion, I never spent more money than what was necessary (ie the first expansion set), or waited until I had gotten gift cards from family that I couldn't use otherwise.  Part of the fun for me is being able to build up over time, and I am well aware of how limited I am as a student ;P  But again, you're right: I have noticed similar tendencies nagging at the back of my mind as when I played computer games.  That does scare me a little.  I just don't know, though.  I do need some kind of social outlet, and being that I'm going into IT, some kind of nerdy pursuit like it might help me fit in in the long run."

StopGaming,32d8jy,fexef,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of ""control"" in the context of addiction is not really a new concept. For any 12 step program, the first step is literally admitting that we are powerless - we have no control over the addiction itself. For instance, for me, I don't have ""control"" over my video gaming. I can't moderate. I never could. When it comes to stress and methods of escape, I have no doubt that many of us chose our ""drug of choice"" because of the issues we didn't want to or couldn't cope with. Much of my early family life was traumatic and I needed an escape. That led into my adult life, relying on video games as my way of coping and dealing with stress. However - the key here is that it eventually turned into an addiction. Sure, I can theorize on the source (escapism / inability to cope / emotional immaturity / etc), but the most important point that I need to remember is that I CANNOT CONTROL MY GAMING. I CANNOT MODERATE! So despite my knowledge and practice of what can be considered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, it will never change my inability to moderate with games. To me, I never feel satisfied with a ""moderate"" game session. It just leads me to wanting more. Even right now in my life, I'm feeling much more stable, no emotional trauma, no stresses I'm ignoring, if I pick up the figurative controller it will inevitably lead to my 70+hour/week habit. Maybe not necessarily today, but it will. It always has.  It's important for me to remember that about addiction.   Does knowing what Dodes talks about help? Absolutely. It helps to recognize what may be a TRIGGER for me to relapse. However...there are many moments where I am triggered and crave gaming for seemingly NO REASON whatsoever. What do I do then? What do I have to fall back on? If I had only studied CBT techniques, I feel I'd be lost and up a creek in those moments that are inexplicable and random. It's why I personally need to be actively involved in recovery in my life.  Do I go to meetings just to ""not game"" again? Hell no. It's just a happy benefit. Recovery has also helped me to rewire my brain and learn to stop BEHAVING LIKE AN ADDICT even if I'm not gaming. That's the real important gift of it for me.  If you're curious, we'd love to have you at one of our meetings. http://cgaa.info/online-meetings/  Thanks again for your share."
StopGaming,32d8jy,digital_excess,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"That's a good point - twelve step programs also have the same insight that a sense of helplessness is the driving force behind addictions.  I do not think that true moderation is impossible for any current addict and that a twelve step program is the only way out. I'm not sure if you were trying to say this or not, if not I apologize for the misunderstanding.  Although twelve-step programs such as CGAA are helpful for you and many others as individuals, and can help you truly address addictions rather than superficially address them, the evidence seems to show that twelve-step programs have lower success rates than other addiction treatment programs. Here's a short interview with Dodes about the topic.  I do not mean to say that cgaa is worthless. It's definitely better than nothing and it can be and is an effective method.

Before this I was only interested in talking to gamer friends who played the same games, or going for a LAN party once a year. Now I actually go out as well and made many new friends.  I guess the years of grinding in MMO's help to put up with similar work in real life (like boring homework, doing dishes and so on). Before the relapse, I was more productive than ever before. Not only was there time for everything, there was also motivation and energy for everything. Getting things done gave me the same feeling of achievement I would when 'accomplishing' things in games.

In my opinion its not hard or easy, its just boring. Of course its going to be boring at the beggining. But its worth it.. I remember my first weeks here on /r/StopGaming (WTFBadge? I had a relapse a few days ago) I was not playing videogames anymore but i was spending all day in youtube and twitch.   One day my videogames came back because i had to use a system restore point. That day i realised that my life was still shit, and that it was my fault, because i was still spending my entire day in front of my screen instead of doing something positive for my life. (Dont make that same mistake.)   That day i just sat on the floor all day, i was bored as hell. But I did not turn my computer on. I just spend the entire day there thinking. And it pointed out some of the reasons of my addictions (IOW I found some of the problems gaming was hiding me from.)  The next day I did the exact same thing from morning to night, sitting at my bedroom floor. I tried meditation, I tried thinking about life. I was so bored that i decided to do pushups.   Besides trying to solve the problems I identified, I started doing home workouts regularly, I stopped missing classes (im on college), I meditate daily and i started writing a ""journal."" I have not found a ""hobbie"" yet, but im not that worried about that since there is a lot that i want to focus on.  My next step should be to get out of the house more often and try to be social, I have a few friends but I dont talk to them or see them much.  The only thing i do on my computer now is check my email, research about topics of interest and browse /r/StopGaming because it helps me when i have urges to play.  TLDR   1) Delete every videogame, moderation is a trap  2) Try to stay away from your computer, sit and think about life, do some introspection, meet yourself, try to figure out what void gaming was filling in your life.   3) Start doing things to make your life better. You have to figure out what.  4) Try to find new hobbies / hang out with friends. But keep working on yourself, thats 1# priority at the moment.

StopGaming,328h4i,ImSoToxicTV,5,Sat Apr 11 14:58:44 2015 UTC,"Wow i really wish i had stopped gaming when i was 16. This is a great decision you are taking today.  This is something I realised: Gaming has negative effects on your brain, one of them is that it makes real life harder to enjoy. Every other activity seems pointless. With time it heals and you will find new activities and hobbies. Just hang through the painful / boring period.  The best advice i can give you is: Don't be as stupid as I was: Do not relapse because every day counts. Once you start making progress, dont go back to gaming as I did. Moderation is a trap."
StopGaming,328h4i,ElectricRhino5,2,Sat Apr 11 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar position to you for about three months before I actually quit. I understand that idea of you being ""Good enough"" and being able to manage gaming. What made me quit wasn't that I missed out on a major life event like you'll hear other people say sometimes. I quit because I decided that I didn't want to be ""Good Enough"", if you want to life a life where society tells you you're okay and there's nothing wrong with you that's fine. It really is; you can go to your job for 30 years of your life and have a nice marriage and maybe grab drinks or whatever you like to do. I just decided that ""Good Enough"" life wasn't for me. I decided that I wanted to live a spectacular life. In the end imagine what you can do with your life instead of gaming. If you truly don't want to do those things then you are actually fine, however; if you want a life better than what you have right now, I can guarantee you that gaming is not going to help you at all. Value where you are in life by what you want to do with your life, not what society tells you is an A. In the end, you only have to prove things to yourself."
StopGaming,328h4i,Katastrop,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:05:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to quit gaming either, as it was my most prominent hobby (I would very rarely make room for drawing, programming and learning a language). When I took a hard look at my life, I realized that all I can say about my life is ""I play video games"". I used to be so good at drawing, that my teachers in middle school thought I traced. I read books like they were candy and I got pretty good at playing the guitar. I had stopped all of that, and I really wish I didn't.  It's never too late to start, your 16, I'm going to be 23. I completely understand why it's hard to start a new hobby. I'm a perfectionist, so when I start something I focus to the point where I have to be the best. If I'm not the best it stresses me out, so it's hard for me to get over that and just draw, or play guitar. I feel the reason a skill based hobby isn't holding your interest is because they take more energy than playing a game does. When you fail, or aren't progressing as fast as you want it makes you feel like you don't want to do it anymore.  We're here for you, I've only been here a couple of days and the community here is phenomenal. Just try to stop gaming for a couple of days if you really want to, try those other hobbies again or find new ones.

My plan: All out attack! I need to work on my self care more than anything. This means both body and mind.  Body: Exercise. Gonna set my evenings full of workouts with the fiance revolving around martial arts/gymnastics. Perhaps you'll see me on /r/capoeira at some point. I've taken it for roughly 2 years and haven't fully committed myself yet.  Mind: Professional Help and Group Therapy. I just went to see a pro this week. Diagnosed with ADD and depression.

Feeling like you will lose your current friends is common when you are thinking about moving on from games... so I want you to know that's normal.  So here are a few thoughts:   You need to make this decision from a place of what's best for your life and once you make that decision you can worry about things like what will happen with your friends and things like that. But it's most important that you make this decision based on whether or not playing games is a good thing in your life. Making friends and/or maintaining relationships with your current ones is something you can figure out when you get there. What did you have trouble with when you went cold turkey last time? Were you bored? If so, you need new activities this time. From the sounds of it, you want to quit but you're just scared of what will happen to your friends and/or when you go cold turkey. In my experience, this is something to push through and you'll grow from it.   If you want to learn more about how to quit, read this article.  When it comes to your friends I'd recommend joining some other extra curricular activities. This will help you make more friends and have more in common with them. The reason you feel closer to your gamer friends is because you are gaming with them. So you can learn from this by finding commonalities between you and other friends by doing different activities together. Clubs at school are great for this. Other ideas for making friends here.  Hope that helps! You can do it, we believe in you. :)"

But when you characterize online porn as junk food, the solution is obvious: don't eat it.  Easier said than done, I know, but the thing I find helps most people is to understand that you can't refrain from doing something you like.  You can, however, change the person you are into the kind of person who doesn't even like that stuff.  Sugar Smacks still taste the same as they did under Carter, but I don't know anybody who still eats them.  Do the same for soda.  In medical school a lot of the guys (who went into ortho) went to the gym and would discuss with euphoria how much canned tuna they ate.  ""There's 15g of protein and zero fat!"" they'd whisper to each other, and they'd sooner eat salamander eyes than lick a Dorito. That was the kind of guys they were.    This may not be a reassuring solution to some, but I can promise you that it is the only solution: you have to decide you're not the kind of person who wastes time on that.  Condemning it, banning it, hiding from it-- all will lead to failure.  Lust isn't the trigger,  boredom is, idle hands are something or other, so the sooner you get a default activity, the better.  When your wife walks in on you in the midst of an overhand tug and she moans, ""you are pathetic!"" she's really a vowel off, apathetic is more accurate and considerably more amenable to improvement.   http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/02/hes_just_not_that_into_anyone.html"

StopGaming,31tfko,zecg,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:27:28 2015 UTC,"Well,   The interesting thing about addictions-- include gambling and sex and internet and ""dangerous behaviors"" and whatever else you want-- is that they all share something in common.  Allegedly this thing is dopaminergic pathways to the striatum and etc, but saying that gets you nothing.  It's astounding that the layperson chooses to think in these terms which though they are true are utterly meaningless, utterly unactionable, until you remember, oh, of course, in narcissism believing something is preferable to doing something because the former is about you and the latter is about everyone else.  Slightly off topic but here's an important example: say you yell every day at an/your eight year old girl for sloppy homework, admittedly a terrible thing to do but not uncommon, and eventually she thinks, ""I'm terrible at everything"" and gives up, so the standard interpretation of this is that she has lost self-confidence, she's been demoralized, and case by case you may be right, but there's another possibility which you should consider: she chooses to focus on ""I'm terrible at everything"" so that she can give up.  ""If I agree to hate myself I only need a 60?  I'll be done in 10 minutes. ""  It is precisely at this instant that a parent fails or succeeds, i.e. fails: do they teach the kid to prefer (find reinforcement in) the drudgery of boring, difficult work with little daily evidence of improvement, or do they teach the kid to prefer (find reinforcement in) about 20 minutes of sobbing hysterically and then off to Facebook and a sandwich?  Each human being is only able to learn to prefer one of those at a time.  Which one does the parent incentivize?  If you read this as laziness you have utterly missed the point. It's not laziness, because you're still working hard, but you are working purposelessly on purpose. The goal of your work is to be done the work, not to be better at work.  For a great many people this leads to an unconscious, default hierarchy in the mind, I'm not an epidemiologist but you got it in you sometime between the ages of 5 and 10:  <doing awesome>  is better than  <feeling terrible about yourself>  is better than  <the mental work of change>  You should memorize this, it is running your life.  ""I'm constantly thinking about ways to improve myself.""  No, you're gunning the engine while you're up on blocks.  Obsessing and ruminating is a skill at which we are all tremendously accomplished, and admittedly that feels like mental work because it's exhausting and unrewarding, but you can no more ruminate your way through a life crisis than a differential equation.  So the parents unknowingly teach you to opt for <b>, and after a few years of childhood insecurity, you'll choose the Blue Pill  and begin the dreaming: someday and someplace you'll show someone how great you somehow are.  And after a few months with that someone they will eventually turn to you, look deep into your eyes, and say, ""look, I don't have a swimming pool, but if I did I'd drown myself in it.  Holy Christ are you toxic.""  ""Well, my parents were really strict, they made me--""  Keep telling yourself that.  Chances are if your parents are between 50 and 90 they were simply terrible.  Great expectations; epic fail.  Your parents were dutifully strict about their arbitrary and expedient rules, not about making you a better person.  ""Clean your plate!  Go to college!""   Words fail me.  They weren't tough, they were rigidly self-aggrandizing.  ""They made me practice piano an hour every day!"" as if the fact of practice was the whole point; what they did not teach you is to try and sound better every practice. They meant well, they loved you, but the generation that invented grade inflation is not also going to know about self-monitoring and paedeia, which is roughly translated, ""making yourself better at piano.""  ""You don't know how hard it is to raise kids,"" says someone whose main cultural influence in life was the Beatles.   The fact that you will inevitably fail in creating Superman is not a reason not to try.   Oh:  I bet I know what you chose when you were 8.  The mistake is in thinking that misery and self-loathing are the ""bad"" things you are trying to get away from with Ambien and Abilify or drinking or therapy or whatever, but you have this completely backwards. Self-loathing is the defense against change, self-loathing is preferable to <mental work.> You choose misery so that nothing changes, and the Ambien and the drinking and the therapy placate the misery so that you can go on not changing. That's why when you look in the mirror and don't like what you see, you don't immediately crank out 30 pushups, you open a bag of chips. You don't even try, you only plan to try. The appearance of mental work, aka masturbation.   The goal of your ego is not to change, but what you don't realize is that time is moving on regardless.   http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/06/amy_schumer_offers_you_a_look.html"

For me it wasn't great things that filled that void but as I've come to think ""2 steps forward 1 step back is still 1 step forward"". Initially after quitting gaming I substitued Reddit and internet quite a bit meshed with a decent amount of Netflix and Amazon Prime Movies. Then I limited Reddit to worldnews, Politics, ELI5, AMA, etc. After that limit was created; I found I was still spending 3-5 hours a day on Facebook, Slickdeals.net, AmazonPrime Reddit etc. After that realization, I started limiting my internet progressively until I am where I am now : doing about an hour of nonesential internet for 75 mins a day.  I'd say I'm on about a month to a month and a half of heavily limited internet. Boy do I get a lot of shit done now; I get a bit antsy if I'm not attacking something on my to do list. I'd also say I'm more hopeful for the future, the most disciplined I can ever remember, I take my time in the mornings (generally), I get relatively great sleep and I apply myself in my daily activities quite well (which includes socializing with less anxiety) I don't miss all the old shit all that much.

People don't look at gaming like fishing, reading, etc. because you will never have really gained anything from playing a game. There will always be something more important you could be doing or working towards."
StopGaming,31qhtf,labai,3,Tue Apr 7 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"Your comparison misses the point completely, let me tell how and why! We are creatures of habits, any action or inaction you take in life, it manifests in to outcome some kind. The end result is a habit (healthy or not) habits is what shapes our lives and society.   Multiple studies shows that hobbies like gaming are linked to negative behaviour like to those individuals who are addicted to, gambling, drugs, alcohol. Therefore it often leads to:   Anger Aggression Fear Anxiety Destructive, harmful, or even suicidal behaviour   I'm not going in detail to much, thousand books written go read it if you interested in deeper perspective of subject.

StopGaming,31qhtf,mapletaurus,4,Tue Apr 7 13:09:42 2015 UTC,"Video games elicit much higher levels of biophysical 'response', mainly effecting hormones. These responses include increased dopamine (reward/excitement) and cortisol (stress). You are liable to become more [happy/sad/frustrated/angry] playing video games than while reading or even watching a movie. Elevated hormone levels have negative effects in the moment (profuse sweating, excited behavior, irrational thought), but they also have negative effects over a longer period of time-- your brain structure and processes change to facilitate the extra hormones; one common side-effect -but certainly not the only one- being relatively low levels of dopamine when not gaming, which causes symptoms of depression.  EDIT: Gaming is definitely the same as injecting. Everything is, really. They ALL effect the levels of hormones/chemicals in our bodies and brains. The only thing worth looking at, to differentiate them and say ""this is OK to do, this should be moderated"", is the extent to which any given activity alters the levels of hormones/chemicals."

Plus TV is programming you to believe whatever it is they are selling you.  Fishing is relaxing and you can spend time thinking introspectively while being undestracted.  While gaming is full of distractions   That's my basic thoughts on the difference between the three"

After quitting for the longest time I struggled with video issues, internet issues, sleep issues and happiness issues. It's been a battle but each problem has been a step in the right direction at least.  Good for you. How much of your life did you game for. I'm guessing that's where the disparity in our post quitting stories comes from. For a long time I didn't consider it a problem or I'd go in and out of considering it a problem. Also I've gamed to some extent for 25 years or so of my life.  It's pretty foreign ground for me.   Impressive that you can do that."

StopGaming,31o01k,TheCyanKnight,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"Whelp, while I've got some moderate feelings of longing for gaming; I fullfill those longings instead by kicking it with friends, exploring my area (I just moved to the east coast from the midwest and there is a lot to see and do) and completing tasks.   On top of that, I take pride in my daily successes which are more and more frequent as opposed to before when I'd feel self shame for pissing my day away on a daily basis.   I find that when it comes to my desires I can lose myself in hanging out with friends or (like today) watching NCAA bball. Thankfully, these things don't devour swaths of my day and furthermore they occur as rewards as opposed to just some B.S. procrastination or addiction. Basically any time I kick it, it's well deserved frivolity as opposed to a tainted binge/bender.  How long have you been battling your gaming demons?"
StopGaming,31o01k,zbud,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:20:04 2015 UTC,Well done on your journey so far.   But there must be a reason you gave up?  Romanticising past usage is a trap for addicts.   Sitting throgh feelings and situations is the key. Cravings pass in time  And it's ok to mourn a little. It'll pass.
StopGaming,31o01k,standsure,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"Well done! the feelings remain there as long as you keep interacting with them, through meditation we can learn how to take a step back and observe them instead of interacting and running along with our thoughts and stories.   &nbsp  It's not like where you can just not think about it, thoughts will occur and sometimes you'll see triggers that will initiate further urges for you to check information about your past gaming life, i know because it happens to me a lot and its a bitch.. But now i just deal with it through meditation and when i am not at home i don't even think about gaming.   &nbsp  So if you still maintain screenshots or shortcuts or photos or disc copies of your games or got a program related to games booting up everyday - that's incentive for urges that lead to triggers leading to edging and in worst case scenario - relapse... You need to delete everythign related to gaming entirely if you still have any crumbs related to it... because our brain tricks us, we think that stuff was so great... If it was then why the heck did we quit in teh first place lol.   Good luck bro stay strong!!!, best advice i can give is just to distance yourself from games as much as you can and when you get urges don't play into them but get through them"

It's pretty crazy how the addiction just does something to brain that doesn't go away.  I will say this though.  I will never go back because my life continues to amaze me and you would be surprised at home awesome life can be.

StopGaming,31ndjj,Catjack,2,Mon Apr 6 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"That's really one of the worst-case type of scenarios, wanting to quit but being directly exposed to games every day in your own home. I feel for you.  My best advice would be to explain to your room-mate your desire to quit, and even suggesting that he does as much as possible to keep you away from them (so essentially, tell him to not let you use any of his stuff), to help you.  About selling your PC and laptop: you don't need a gaming PC or laptop for school (unless you're required to do something like CGI creation, in which case you're SOL), so I would go ahead and sell them and buy ones that can't game. Your best bet are Pentium processors: for the most part they're not good enough for gaming and the newer ones even have integrated GPU's that are not fast enough for playing games.     Good luck!"
StopGaming,31ndjj,Rodranquil,2,Mon Apr 6 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"Do as  72U11 said. I'm in the same position as you, but I have 4 gaming roomates instead of one xD  I didn't say it was impossible or that I couldn't, I said ""I will"" and I did it. They all play after dinner so I go to my bedroom after having dinner and read for a while and then go to sleep and wake up early.  So the key thing is just to avoid staying in the same room when your roomate is playing. And look into yourself to see if you are truly ready to leave gaming, if you are really convinced that it is enough. If any cravings appear, rationalize, you haven't any good reason to play videogames.  Good luck =)"

For people like me, I still think that single-player games are fine, mainly because the constant growth and social aspects of gaming are mostly, if not entirely removed, and the challenge aspect of it is also partially removed, particularly on story-driven games.   Single-player games, to me, are not addictive in nature. I personally don't see much of a difference between playing a single-player game and watching a TV show, but again, that's just ME.  That said, there are also thousands of pieces of literature, movies, and even TV shows that offer the philosophical depth needed to ""move on"", while also being entertaining and keeping you away from games."
