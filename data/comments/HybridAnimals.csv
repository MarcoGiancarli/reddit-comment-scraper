HybridAnimals,3c6vc2,ShrimpFood,2,Tue Jul 7 22:59:20 2015 UTC,"This is in no way a criticism because I agree that the cleaness/quality of this image is well above average.  I'm just going to throw my 2 cents in on the trunk shadow because you said you had trouble visualizing it.  Forgive me it I'm stating the obvious. When in the snow there is usually light coming from the primary light source in that environment but, there is also, usually, a reflection coming up from the surface of the snow that acts like another (fainter) light source.  I hope this makes sense.  It's perfectly clear in my head but that doesn't mean it will come out when I type.    Edited because of spelling."
